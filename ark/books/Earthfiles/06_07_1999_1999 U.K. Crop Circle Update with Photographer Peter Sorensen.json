Similar to formations back in 1990 to 1991, there were rune-like glyphs attached to circles and rings connected by corridors. You can see these early April photographs at pilot Busty Taylor's web site listed here: www.aviation-uk.com/cropper/99apr2.htm Then on May 2, 1999, at Middle Wallop in Central Hampshire, a new glyph appeared in the yellow-flowered, crisp-stemmed canola which everyone interpreted to be an astronomical eclipse sequence. And by late May, a dramatic Hebrew Menorah was discovered with a nearby smaller formation in wheat fields near Barbury Castle north of Avebury. Another formation-- the first in barley-- resembled an egg and sperm, but with a peculiar variation. Today I talked by phone with cameraman Peter Sorensen now based near Alton Barnes, Wiltshire. Peter has been photographing crop formations in England for most of the 1990's. He and others are frustrated by a U.K. government crackdown on commercial versus individual pilot photo shoots which is making documentation of the crop circles more difficult this year. First I asked him what he considers to be the top three formations so far in 1999. Interview: Peter Sorensen, Crop Formation Photographer, Alton Barnes, Wiltshire, England: \"There's no question at this point that, in my opinion, the best ones are the Menorah-- and I've seen it from the air and from the ground. Gorgeous flow-- like a water flow on the ground in the Menorah. And the little beetle that is near to it is also a fabulous little formation. And the crescents down at Penton. THE CRESCENTS ARE THE NESTED CRESCENTS LIKE PREVIOUS YEARS? Right. Gorgeous from the ground and from the air! I've seen it both ways. And I would like to add to that as my favorite for this summer the eclipse sequence at Middle Wallop. Although I haven't seen it from the ground, I've seen it from the air-- it's 800 bloody feet long! It's just about as long as any formation we've ever had. And it's perfect. And I want to point out to those of your friends who can look at the internet and see the pictures-- that the centers of the standing crop, the circles that are (made) in standing crop are away from the tramline. If you're going to fake a crop circle, you have to stand in the middle of a circle and then throw a circle around while a guy runs around with a piece of string, right? These centers are in standing crop. Nobody was standing there! I SEE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. CENTERS OF STANDING CROP. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Right. You would have to stand in the middle of the crop in order to make that circle for each one that goes through the sequence (of the eclipse). And obviously nobody ever stood there (in each of those circle centers where the crop is standing not down). YEAH, THERE IS NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER OF ANY DOWNED CROP AT THE MIDDLE OF ANY OF THOSE SEQUENCES IN THE ECLIPSE. That's right. Exactly. WHAT ABOUT IN WILTSHIRE-- IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE A REPRESENTATION OF AN EGG SURROUNDED BY SPERM SURROUNDED BY A CIRCLE SURROUNDED BY A SERIES OF CIRCLES. If those are egg and sperm-- the sperm are fleeing from the egg, pointing in the wrong direction! Having said that, it's the first formation in barley and the flow on the ground was absolutely gorgeous. It was just as beautiful as you could possibly imagine. It was just like the water effect. It looks like water had been flowing through a stream. RIGHT. WELL, WHAT ABOUT THE MENORAH? The Menorah is without question a Menorah, the candlesticks the Hebrews use during their spiritual celebrations and by God, the spiritual aspects of this phenomenon of all these years has touched on many different religions. This is not the first time that Judaism has been saluted by the phenomenon. And here we have an absolutely spectacular, magnificent and huge formation in the same field, by the way-- my dear Linda, this is the same field where the Tree of Life, exactly the same. THE KABALA FROM TWO YEARS AGO (1997). The Kabala, yes-- that formation was one of the most important ones that we've had, certainly in that year. And here we have a follow up - very interesting indeed. HOW FAR IS THIS FIELD FROM DOWNTOWN ALTON BARNES? Well a good fifteen or twenty miles away. FIFTEEN TO TWENTY. BUT THIS IS IN THE SAME FIELD AS THE FAMOUS BARBURY CASTLE FORMATION? This Menorah formation is in the same field as the Tree of Life formation-- the other Judaic Kabala formation we had two years ago. But it is about one-half mile or one-quarter mile from the field where the original Barbury Castle triangle was in. IT''S IN THE GENERAL AREA, BUT NOT SPECIFICALLY THE SAME FIELD AS THE VERY CLASSIC 1991 TRIANGLE WITH THE CIRCULAR PATTERNS AT THOSE THREE CORNERS. Yeah. That magnificent-- perhaps the greatest of all formations in my opinion-- that was about three-quarters of a mile to the west of where this one is right now (Menorah). And then not far away is somehow positioned in the same field something that looks like a beetle or a bug with pinchers in the front which reminds us of the 1994 formations that showed the spider and the other bugs we had that year, the scorpions and such. Very similar in flavor to that. Almost as if two entities had worked in the field simultaneously because they both appeared on the same"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"morning. And yet, their flavor is so different, their feeling is so different, but they were in the same field. WERE THEY BOTH DISCOVERED AT THE SAME TIME? OR WAS ONE THERE AND THEN THE OTHER DISCOVERED? I think they were both discovered at the same time. There was no report the previous day and then the next morning, they were both there. THIS FORMATION THAT IS IN THE SAME FIELD AND NOT FAR FROM THE MENORAH, IT DOES HAVE THAT BEETLE PINCER-LIKE LOOK. BUT IT COULD ALSO BE ARGUED THAT IT HAS ALMOST AN ECLIPSE ASTRONOMY NATURE TO IT. HAS ANYONE DISCUSSED THAT? Well, you're right. No, I haven't heard anybody else say that, but it's true that these jaws, these pincers, form a complete circle unlike the spider and the scorpions of 1994 where the jaws were obviously open. In this case, there is a complete circle closing - the tips of the jaws are touching-- and you also have a circle inside of a larger circle which does suggest the eclipse and we've had other eclipse formations already this year. IN THIS YEAR WHERE ON AUGUST 11TH, 1999 WILL BE THE LAST TOTAL SOLAR ECLIPSE FOR ANOTHER 79 YEARS IN EUROPE-- IT IS INTRIGUING THAT THERE HAVE BEEN THESE SERIES OF WHAT APPEAR TO BE ECLIPSE-LIKE FORMATIONS. HAVE PEOPLE ARGUED THAT IT MUST BE HUMAN BECAUSE THE ECLIPSE IS COMING IN AUGUST? Oh, God, the idiots argue both sides of this situation! Of course, it could be human. But then exactly for the same reasons, beings from who knows where?!-- would use the same symbols. It's to wake us up. DOESN'T IT WONDER WHAT WILL BE SIGNIFICANT AROUND THIS AUGUST 11TH, 1999 SOLAR ECLIPSE IN EUROPE? Oh, boy, I can't wait. It's going to be wonderful here. Absolutely-- it's going to be the enlightenment-- perhaps some of the key information coming through to humanity will be arriving in these fields just at that same time. I AM LOOKING AT A PHOTOGRAPH OF WHAT APPEARS TO BE A SYMBOLIC REPRESENTATION THAN NONE OTHER THAN THE PROGRESSION OF AN ECLIPSE. HAVE YOU BEEN IN THAT ONE? I've flown over that one-- yeah. That formation is down near Middle Wallop close to Andover. It's a funny story. Busty (Taylor, pilot and photographer) was very reluctant to go into this area because right now the pressure is so powerful from the government to keep people from flying over the crop circles. It's a long story. But we flew over this formation and Busty would not even stop. He would not do the usual circles like we do orbits around the formations. We flew by as if we were not interested in it at all and I just had to keep my camera going the whole time and get a picture of that formation. Yes, this one is certainly representing the progression of an eclipse from the first touch of the moon over the sun until it is completely covered and then you have a corona at the last shot. HAS ANYBODY IN ENGLAND CLAIMED TO HAVE MADE THIS? No. WHAT IS THE STORY BEHIND THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT PRESSURE ABOUT NOT FLYING OVER CROP FORMATIONS?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The English government-- actually their Federal Aviation Administration-- whatever they call that-- has a very strict rule about differences between a commercial pilot and a private pilot. Now, all my life over here-- all these years I've been here-- I've been flying with private pilots. However, technically speaking, if you take a photograph and sell it, it becomes a commercial enterprise. So, suddenly-- or at least last summer-- the government decided to crack down on these private pilots who have been flying us because we sell some pictures. It has thrown a tremendous big bucket of cold water on the whole situation and now it's extremely difficult for us to fly. The commercial pilots will charge five times as much money to go up in the plane and basically that is forbidding. I'm stretching my budget to the last penny, especially this summer to try to get out here and get these pictures. And suddenly, I'm forced to fly basically by helicopters-- 500 pounds-- that's almost $1,000 an hour-- on a commercial helicopter. I've done that already this summer. I tell you, you get beautiful results with a helicopter, but ... TO COVER A WHOLE SUMMER DOING THAT AT A $1,000 A SHOT .. It's impossible. No, it can't be done. IT ALMOST MAKES ME WONDER IF IT IS CALCULATED BECAUSE POLITICAL PRESSURES WOULD KNOW THAT PEOPLE TAKING THE CROP FORMATIONS SERIOUSLY AND TRYING TO DOCUMENT THEM ALL CANNOT AFFORD THESE KINDS OF AERIAL FLIGHT PRICES. SO, DOESN'T THAT MEAN THAT THE END RESULT IS THAT FEWER AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS WOULD BE TAK E N ? No question at all. Several other photographers that I know-- people who live here in England and who have been doing it-- are cutting back drastically. Drastically. Steve Alexander, Lucy Pringle-- these photographers who do a great job are now doing at least less than one-third what they would have done last year at this time because of this government crack down. WHAT HAS HAPPENED THIS LAST WEEK THESE FIRST SEVEN DAYS OF JUNE? Virtually nothing. It's been a big hush-- after the Menorah and nested crescents formation-- nothing! We're all sitting here on pins and needles saying, 'Come on, now!' What's going to happen next? The weather has been, to be honest, pretty lousy. Very few moments of bright sunshine. Only one or two days where there has been no rain. So, there has not been a lot of opportunity for whatever entities want to get out there and do their work. So, after the Menorah and the nested crescents-- that's been about it. Nothing new. SO WE'RE IN A LULL AND SOME OF US HAVE SAID IN THE PAST SOMETIMES THESE LULLS SEEM TO COME LIKE THE HUSH AT THE EYE OF A STORM BEFORE THE RUSH OF NEW FORMATIONS. That's right. At a moment, we're in a gap. And we're all looking around to see what happens next.\" More Information: Peter Sorensen continues to find what he calls \"magically bent stalks\" in the formations that flow like water, bending flat to the ground with no cracks or creases. Biophysicist W. C. Levengood is convinced from his research with plants gathered from formations over the past several years that a spinning plasma vortex containing microwave frequencies are interacting with the plants in some of the formations. The source of the spinning plasma vortex is not"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"known. But Mr. Levengood hypothesizes that the microwave frequencies are heating the plant cells, producing fundamental biophysical and biochemical changes which allow the stems to go flat to the ground in a softened state before cooling flat on the soil. Mr. Levengood says that such cell changes in cereal crops cannot be produced by hoaxers with boards and string, leaving the still unanswered questions after ten years of designs worldwide: Who-- or what-- is producing these enigmatic formations year after year-- and why?
