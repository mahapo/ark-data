That's when you can see through them.\" - J im Sparks, E. T. Experiencer and Author, The Keepers April 20, 2007 Southern Florida - In 1995, at a conference about the human abduction syndrome, one of the participants was a man named Jim Sparks, born Jim Sparacino to his Italian parents on November 15, 1954. Unlike many abductees who experience loss of consciousness and missing time, Jim’s interactions with what he calls ‘aliens’ have been mostly conscious. Even back in 1995, Jim Sparks made a clear distinction between what he described as “small, grey, drone worker types” versus “taller, true aliens, or supervisors.” Jim explained that when he was thirty-four years old in 1988, he was happily married and had thriving real-estate work in both Texas and North Carolina. Then suddenly, beings from other worlds entered his life and he thought he was losing his mind. Jim Sparks had interactions with three different types: one category was the grey-skinned, large dark eyes, that apparently come in many varieties, including small androids that do work for taller, very intelligent controllers. Jim also had a conscious, face-to-face encounter with several tall, reptilian-skinned humanoids. Jim says those reptilians warned that the Earth’s environment is facing a crisis and that the planet must be saved, whether humans survive or not. From 1988 into the 1990s, Jim was schooled by the Greys in front of computers and 3-dimensional projections. Jim was forced to learn the alien symbols and numbers. Eventually, Jim says he was also contacted by alleged U. S. government intelligence operatives who wanted to know about the alien symbols and numbers. Jim has always stressed that when people see aerial craft jump from one side of the sky to the other, or see entities that appear translucent and walk through solid walls, or feel a weight go down on their bed, but cannot see what’s making the weight – it’s all advanced, alien technologies. On April 13, 2007, I interviewed Jim Sparks during the Ozark UFO Conference at Eureka Springs, Arkansas, for Coast to Coast AM with George Noory. Jim talked about his personal experiences with the advanced technologies and said: \"What really intrigues me is the E.T.s can be 5% to 10% in this dimension on this physical plane while the rest is in another dimension. There are dimensions out there like layers of an onion... The E. T.s molecularly change the vibration of something so they can be in another dimension and solid, but be projected here in only 5%. That's when you can see through them.\" "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"After I returned to my Albuquerque, New Mexico, office from the Ozark conference, I found an email from a radio listener about his own encounter with a scaly, translucent entity in his southern Florida bedroom on August 27, 2006. The man has requested anonymity, so in this report, I will call him \"John Smith.\" He is 30-years-old with a couple of years in business courses at a college. He is currently self-employed in the cleaning industry. He talked first about a sighting of an orange, glowing, oval-shaped aerial object he saw on Thanksgiving night 2004 that left him thinking about extraterrestrials, but with no conscious knowledge of E. T. interactions in his life. Interview: John Smith, Self-Employed, Southern Florida: \" It was Thanksgiving night in 2004, about 10 PM. This was 100% real. What it was, I can’t say. I just know it was completely abnormal. I was at my aunt and uncle’s house. I was getting ready to go outside. They have a pool and hot tub and I just wanted to go out and relax. On my way out the door, I passed through the screened in patio area and suddenly got an intuitive hit or premonition – which is not new for me. I’m a normal guy, but I get these hits. And this was that I was going to see something extraterrestrial or UFO-related, abnormal, out of this world. I got into the hot tub to relax, just leaning back and looking up at the sky. Then I hear a plane with a propeller. It was pretty loud actually, off to my left. It made me look up and I could see the plane off some distance. As I was looking at the plane, at the corner of my eye I could also see a light. I turn my head and lock on to the light. It was about 100 to 150 feet in the air. \"O val, plasma disc\" the color of a ripe peach with pink and dark colors swirling inside it, about 100 to 150 feet in the air above hot tub on Thanksgiving night 2004, in southern Florida. Sketch © 2007 by John Smith. The light was orange, like a ripe peach with some pink – an oval, plasma disc, I guess you could say. That’s what it looked like. I don’t know what it actually was. It also had some black in there – not a lot – and it looked like the colors were swirling around inside. This was directly over the house where I was when I was in the hot tub. I don’t know if it was a coincidence, or had something to do with me. I don’t really know. IF YOU EXTEND YOUR ARM AND COMPARE THE ENDS OF YOUR FINGERS OR FIST TO THE SIZE OF THE ORANGE OVAL, ABOUT HOW BIG WAS IT? I would say about an inch. THE PLANE WAS MUCH SMALLER THAN THE ORANGE OVAL? Ye s . DID YOU RECEIVE ANY INTUITIVE IMPRESSION THAT THE NOISY PLANE WAS THERE BECAUSE THE ORANGE OBJECT WAS THERE? No. I’m not certain the plane pilot was even aware of the orange oval. SO WHAT HAPPENED NEXT? The oval light is above the house at that moment, as I’m looking up and I focused clearly on it. Then it shot all the way across over the horizon to the west very quickly. Obviously that is not normal, but what it was, I can’t tell you. THE INFERENCE IS THAT WHATEVER WAS IN THE ORANGE GLOWING OVAL MIGHT HAVE BEEN FROM SOMEWHERE OFF PLANET? I would lean that way."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" August 27, 2006 - Translucent Scaly Entity WHEN IS THE NEXT EPISODE? It was two years later on August 27, 2006, which was the night of a Coast to Coast AM interview with Whitley Strieber talking about his latest book entitled, The Greys . I was relaxed on my couch listening to the interview and imagining myself there with Whitley, feeling the feelings for about 2 ½ hours. I remember feeling really creeped out, but enjoying the entertainment. Then I felt really tired and wanted to go to bed. I lay down and tried to sleep, but I was still 'in the zone' of what Whitley had been talking about. Now, I’m lying down on my back in the center of my bed. The headboard is against the wall and the bed is in the center of the wall. The wall that’s across from my headboard beyond my feet – if you take that wall and go left, it runs into the corner, which comes back toward the wall at the head of the bed. At that corner, I have two, very tall bookshelves packed with books. There is one shelf on each wall so they make a corner themselves. To the right of that, which is in the center of the wall is my armoire that sticks out from the wall about an inch or inch and a half. Behind the armoire is a night-light. So, the night-light is blocked by the armoire, deflecting the light so it gives indirect lighting off the wall and off the ceiling. My room is fairly dark. I remember trying to fall asleep. I close my eyes. I might fall asleep for a couple of minutes and then wake back up, still in the mental frame of listening to the radio. As I sleep, my eyes open up by themselves. Through that little crack, I could see straight in front of me and right where the wall meets the ceiling. That is where the reflected light shines from the night-light. I’d had that night-light there for a while, at least six months. But I remember that night, the light made me feel very strange for some reason. I guess I wasn’t in a very deep sleep. I would shut my eyes, go back to sleep, wake back up again with my eyes partly open. That probably happened four times. The light bothered me for some reason, almost like it wasn’t supposed to be there, like I was forgetting where I was. As I opened my eyes again, I thought, ‘What is that? What is going on? Where am I?’ I did not seem to recognize my furniture, even though I also knew it was my furniture. Yet for a moment, I did not remember where I was, feeling really strange. Then I feel like there is a presence in the room. I pick my head up and start to pull up my shoulders. I begin to open my eyes and immediately I look to the corner of my room to the left where the bookshelves are. I just felt a presence and right there, I saw a scaly being that was translucent. There, but not there. I could see it, but I could also see through it. T ranslucent entity with \"skin like an iguana\" standing near bookshelf beyond John Smith's bed, seeming to stare at the crystals in front of UFO books. Entity's height was about 4.5 to 5 feet. Sketch © 2007 by John Smith. COULD YOU DESCRIBE THE HEIGHT, THE COLOR, AND OTHER DETAILS? I just took out my tape measure today to go over that before we talked to make sure"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"because I thought you might want to know. It was somewhere between 4 ½ and 5 feet tall, to the top of the head. It was not a typical grey alien. That’s not what I saw. It had skin like an iguana. G reen Iguana ( Iguana iguana ), Jalapao Region, Brazilian Cerrado, Brazil. Photograph © by Laurie Vitt, Ph.D. G reen iguana's long, clawed feet. Its right arm was down by its side. The left I could not see. Its fingers – definitely I could see those! The fingers really creeped me out. They were moving like snakes. CAN YOU ELABORATE? The fingers were real squirmy, like worms, from the hand. DID YOU PERCEIVE A COLOR ON THIS IGUANA SKIN? Yes, yes. It definitely was not like a wet suit or anything like that. I guess I would say the overall color would be between a dark purple to a dark blue. But I also seem to remember a dark mustard around the hands and the arm area. The colors weren’t really bold or complete throughout the whole body. It was not like a solid color. It seemed to fade. I don’t know if that was part of the translucent effect, but that’s how I seem to recall it. WHAT ABOUT THE FEATURES IN THE FACE? I can’t exactly describe the face because this is another weird part - he was not looking directly at me. Or it. My impression was that it was really preoccupied and interested in my collection of books. It was facing directly the section of books that deal with UFOs and aliens and that whole topic. I haven’t even read those books yet. I buy books and get to them later. In front of the books were crystals, including one that had a serpent, or dragon, standing on a geode (natural crystals formed inside sphere that was once volcanic lava). C rystals on John Smith's bookshelf, including the metal dragon holding a crystal and standing on the geode. Image © 2007 by John Smith. WERE YOU ABLE TO SEE ITS EYES?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Yes, I could see the one eye. It was just dark, black, and not big. The translucent being did not turn its head all the way around. It was not like interested in me. It was aware and, I guess, acknowledged me by turning its head that it knew I was awake and staring at it. But it was standing there, didn’t really move, stood still, and just slightly moved its head over to the side. I was probably realistically looking at it for about 30 seconds, but it felt like a minute or two! I was just totally locked on. I seem to remember thinking to myself, ‘It’s translucent. I’m just dreaming! Go back to bed. So, lay down and go back to bed.’ WHEN YOU LAY BACK DOWN ON THE PILLOW, WHAT HAPPENED? I just went back to bed. I looked at it, told myself I was dreaming because it was translucent. I’ve never even heard of that before. UNTIL YOU HEARD ABOUT JIM SPARKS? Yes. And that’s what made me think maybe there was something to it. I did feel a presence and I remember staring at it dead on for at least 30 seconds. It seemed like I could see enough detail that it was there, but also translucent. IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE ENTITY ITSELF TELEPATHICALLY CONVINCED YOU TO MAKE THAT ASSUMPTION AND GO BACK TO SLEEP BECAUSE IT WANTED TO DO SOMETHING WITHOUT YOU OBSERVING? Sure, I’ve thought about that. I think so. That’s possible. WHAT IS YOUR NEXT WAKING MOMENT? I guess it would be the morning. The memory of the being hasn’t bothered me, but it really seems odd to me. ANYTHING UNUSUAL IN YOUR CHILDHOOD? Definitely when I was younger between ages 3 and 4, at night I was afraid of a presence in the hallway. The door was open and I was always looking into the hallway. I could just feel a presence. AS IF YOU WERE BEING WATCHED BY SOMETHING YOU COULD NOT SEE? Yes, and yelling to my mother, ‘I think I see something!’ Or, ‘I think something’s here!'\" More Information: The Keepers: An Alien Message for the Human Race © 2006 by Jim Sparks, published by Wild Flower Press.
