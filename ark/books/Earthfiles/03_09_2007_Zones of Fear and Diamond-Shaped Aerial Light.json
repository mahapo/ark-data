Residents there reported lots of unidentified aerial lights and silver disks, both day and night, along with strange flying creatures that resembled large humans with bat wings. That year, one of the most famous investigators of earth mysteries was John A. Keel. He went to Point Pleasant to investigate and coined the term “Mothman” for the winged humanoids being seen flying in the air.

John Keel wrote a book about his investigations entitled The Mothman Prophecies, published in 1976. In Chapter 7, he describes one night being on the trail of a creature with glowing red eyes who was seen by many, but never photographed or caught. Keel was driving in rural country after midnight and reported: “As I passed a certain point on one of the isolated roads, I was suddenly engulfed in fear. I stepped on the gas and after I went a few yards, my fear vanished as quickly as it came. I continued to drive, eventually returning again to the same spot. And again, a wave of unspeakable fear swept over me. I drove quickly away from the place and then stopped, puzzled. Why would this one stretch of road produce this hair-raising effect? I turned around and slowly headed back, trying to note trees, fence posts, and other landmarks in the dark. Once again, when I reached that particular point, the hair tingled on the back of my neck and I became genuinely afraid. When I emerged from the other side of this invisible zone, I stopped and got out of my car. The air was perfectly still. There wasn’t any audible sound – not even a bird call. I walked back to the “zone of fear” slowly, alert for any rustle of bushes, measuring my own breathing and emotions. I was perfectly calm until I took one step too many and was back in the fear zone. I almost panicked and ran. But I forced myself to look around and proceed slowly. ...I steeled myself and walked once more through that invisible stream, scared out of my wits in transit...” Thirteen years later on December 29, 1980, another bizarre unidentified aerial object shaped like a bright, white, glowing diamond, hovered low over a Texas highway. Driving toward it was 51-year-old Betty Cash, her friend Vickie Landrum and Vickie’s 7-year-old grandson, Colby. The three could see the object shoot down a stream of reddish-orange flames at regular, fast intervals. Vickie Landrum later described it as “like a diamond of fire.” There was also a constant beeping sound coming from the strange diamond-shaped craft. Then the travelers saw dozens of helicopters circling the object. T he Cash-Landrum UFO Incident © 1998 by John F. Schuessler, Geo Graphics. Since 1980, there has been intense controversy about whether the diamond was a U. S. top secret military project – or a vehicle from outer space some how involved with the American government. If the big diamond-shaped craft was not made by humans, who – or what – was piloting it? Zones of Fear in Rocky Mountains Recently a 44-year-old North Dakota resident contacted me about her own experiences with zones of fear and a large diamond-shaped aerial craft that appeared before her and her nephew around 2003. The woman has requested I not use her real name or exact location. So, I will call her Terry Jones from southwestern North Dakota near the Badlands."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"T erry Jones and her husband, a ranch manager, moved to the Theodore Roosevelt National Park Badlands region of North Dakota in 1999, with their three young daughters. Terry was born in 1962 and spent her twenties working for the Forest Service in Idaho as a fire fighter and on a road survey crew. She met her husband in the mid 1980s and they moved to a place north of Livingston, Montana, near the Bridger Mountains. By 1999, her husband accepted a job to manage a ranch at the edge of the Badlands in southwestern North Dakota. Occasionally where she worked in the Rocky Mountains, Terry would come across specific zones that seemed to repel her with fear. Smart and tough, she was shocked while backing away from one of those zones of fear because she got the clear mental impression of a small, grey, non-human entity, sensed it was alien and that it was underground and did not want humans in its “territory.” She has given me permission to share some of her experiences. One occurred in 1990 when Terry was living on a ranch at Henry's Lake, Idaho, with her husband and first child. After dinner, she was doing dishes in front of a window with a view of the mountains around Henry's Lake. Suddenly she noticed a very bright light in the sky.

The mountains are to the north and the south and I see this bright light up in the sky – very, very bright. Stationary, just sitting there, too large to be a star. And I’m thinking, ‘Wow, That is a very large, bright light and it’s just sitting there. How strange! Where did this come from?’ And as I stood there looking at the light thinking those thoughts, three smaller lights come shooting out of it just as bright, but smaller. And they come out one after the other, not at the same time and are shooting out of it (bigger light) to the north and are going behind the mountain range to the north, disappearing around the mountain range. These lights have like a comet tail on them as they travel through the sky. They are going very fast. ‘Whew! Whew!’ WHAT COLOR? They were just white – very bright, white light. And they were the same intensity of brightness also. All of them, the stationary light as well as the three that traveled out of it. The three lights shot out behind the mountain range and disappeared out of sight. I really got the feeling they were headed toward the ground behind the mountain range (north of Henry’s Lake Mountains) – that was their destination. Then the stationary light shot straight up and disappeared. Now, this area the lights went into is definitely zone of fear like you and I were talking about where you don’t go there because there is just this feeling that humans don’t belong there. For myself, I’ve spent my life working in the woods backpacking, mountain climbing, and there are a few areas I’ve been to that feel the same way. B right light emitted three smaller white lights that moved rapidly down behind the Henry's Lake mountains, the location where Terry had sensed sudden and inexplicable fear. Terry's ranch house in bottom center was 1 mile from Henry's Lake, Idaho, 1/2 mile from the base of Henry's Lake mountains and 2 miles from the Zone of Fear behind the 10,000-foot-altitude Henry's Lake mountain. Drawing © 2007 by Terry Jones. One is up on that 10,000-foot-peak that rises next to Henry's Lake in Idaho. One time a friend and I had probably got a mile back in there and just got too nervous, too upset. We could not go any farther. We felt like it would be wrong to go any farther, like something bad would happen, sort of an overwhelming fear of dread came over us. And we didn’t go. We turned around and left and I’ve never had any desire to go back to that area ever again, although I’ve been curious since I saw those lights travel back there and I know they must have landed because of the angle they were shooting down. They were kind of definitely heading straight toward the ground, it looked like to me. YOU HAVE COME TO FEEL THAT THERE ARE AREAS OUT IN THE WILDERNESS THAT SEEM TO BE ALMOST MARKED BY ZONES OF FEAR - THAT HUMANS SENSE THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO GO INTO THEM? Yeah, I’ve felt that feeling as though this was just a bad energy area – a negative feeling – and humans did not belong there. LET’S GO INTO WHAT YOU HAVE COME TO SUSPECT MIGHT BE BEHIND THESE ZONES OF FEAR BECAUSE OF EXPERIENCES YOU’VE HAD. Mid-1980s, Zone of Fear Northwest of Dubois, Wyoming"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The first time I had that feeling was a prophetic sense that it was an alien energy, that’s the only way I can describe it. I was in Wyoming north and west of the town of Dubois, Wyoming. It’s another very remote area. I was with my boyfriend at the time hiking. D ubois, Wyoming, is marked in blue southeast of Yellowstone National Park. Terry's mid-1980s Zone of Fear experience was on a 10,000-foot peak northwest of Dubois. There was a 10,000 peak there we had climbed to the top and were climbing back down the backside of it and we got into this area where I just got really scared. I said, ‘My gosh, this is really a negative energy area! What is it?’ I’m sitting there feeling this energy and feeling scared and nervous – it was the first time I felt this in the back country and the only thing that came to my gut level feeling was aliens. And at that time I had not had any experience seeing lights or anything, but I could not get out of that area fast enough. WHAT YEAR WAS THIS? Back in the mid-1980s. DID ANY IMPRESSION COME INTO YOUR MIND WHEN YOU FELT THAT OVERWHELMING FEAR? No, just that I needed to get out of there as soon as possible, that it was not a good place to be. WHY DO YOU THINK BACK THEN THAT YOU LINKED IT TO EXTRATERRESTRIALS? In that Zone of Fear, it was just a gut level feeling that it was an alien energy – mechanical almost. Does that sound strange? MECHANICAL AND NOT HUMAN? Yeah. YOU HAVE LIVED WITH INTUITIVE SENSES THROUGH MOST OF YOUR LIFE? Yes, I’ve had a lot of psychic experiences and dreams that have come true. YOUR LIVING LIFE WITH INTUITION HAS REINFORCED THAT WHEN YOU DO FEEL A SENSE OF FEAR OR DREAD THAT THERE IS A REASON FOR IT? Yes, absolutely. A Diamond-Shaped Aerial Light"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"But it was here (Badlands of North Dakota) that I had my most intense alien encounter four or five years ago (around 2003-2004). It was on the ranch. It was evening. My nephew was living with us at the time and I had my three daughters and we were just sitting around in the evening having a conversation. My nephew had grown up in California and was a city boy. And I knew he had never really slept outside and looked at the night sky. And I just got this overwhelming urge to get him outside to look at the stars. So, we go outside and there is this fantastic display of northern lights going on at the time. That was a nice added benefit because he got to watch the northern lights for the first time in his life, plus see all the fantastic stars in the sky on the prairie and Badlands of North Dakota. Pretty soon there was a light cruising along the northern sky within the northern lights, traveling through it and zigzagging back and forth. We see this and go, ‘Wow, a UFO! Look!’ We were all excited. I had two of my daughters outside with me and just with the mention of ‘UFO,’ they ran to the house because it scared them. My nephew and I stayed out there to watch. This UFO continues to travel across the northern sky in a zigzag pattern and then suddenly shoots straight down behind the horizon in the north with kind of a bright flash. This was just another bright, white light. It was kind of neat because here the northern lights were going on and here was this fantastic night outside and ‘Wow, we get to watch UFOs, too!’ (laughs) And pretty soon, there are three lights up there and they are all kind of dancing, that’s the only way to describe it – dancing around in the northern lights. This is really a fantastic thing to watch. Three little lights, but very bright, several miles a way, I am thinking, because here in North Dakota you can see pretty far to the horizon. T hree unidentified aerial lights making patterns in the green aurora borealis (Northern lights) above the Badlands, North Dakota, ranch where Terry Jones and her nephew watched 2003 or 2004. Drawing © 2007 by Terry Jones. North of us, they are just sort of zipping around in the northern lights and it was like: ‘What were they doing? Why were they zipping around in the northern lights? Was there a reason why they were doing that?’ I don’t know. Or did the northern lights have anything to do with it? I don’t know either. My husband and I speculated later that maybe they do something with their craft like collect the negative and positive ions out of the atmosphere? I don’t know. Pretty soon they all broke up, all three going in different directions. One takes off to the west, one takes off to the east, one took off another direction and they all disappeared out of sight. My nephew and I are just standing there saying ‘Wow! That was so cool’ So, we’re watching the sky to see some of the lights show back up and all of a sudden, we’re like, ‘Holy crap! Look in the sky!’ I look up where he’s looking and there is a huge, very bright diamond-shaped light right above us. When I say huge, it was not bigger than the moon. But very big, bigger than a star. (Sketch # 3, diamond in upper left.)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"T erry and her nephew are pointing at the diamond-shaped light straight above them that appeared to be about half the size of the full moon on an evening in either 2003 or 2004, at the ranch in the Badlands of southwestern North Dakota. Drawing © 2007 by Terry Jones. AND VERY CLEARLY A DIAMOND SHAPE AS YOU WOULD DRAW A DIAMOND, LET’S SAY, IN SCHOOL? Very clearly a diamond shape. We both agreed to that. We said immediately, ‘That’s diamond shaped! That’s weird. It’s got to be a UFO!’ We don’t have any diamond-shaped craft that we know about anyway. We’re watching this diamond-shaped light right above us in utter excitement and fascination. A few minutes have gone by and it’s just sitting there and we’re sitting there watching it. Then all of a sudden, I get a little nervous like, ‘Maybe they are getting ready to abduct us. Maybe any minute now a beam is going to come shooting out of the bottom of it and we’re going to go up like you see in TV shows.’ The minute I start feeling this fear of abduction, the craft starts moving away from us to the north, zigzagging as it goes very slowly across the sky. ALMOST LEAVING WITH A SASHAY LIKE, 'OK, YOU'RE AFRAID. WE'RE GOING TO LEAVE'? Yes, I thought it was related to my fear. The second I started feeling the fear and imagining abduction in my mind, the light started moving north very slowly. Then I was almost sorry I felt that way because I felt like I had chased it away. And it just slowly disappeared up into the sky – the light got smaller and smaller and smaller, zigzagging the whole time, and then just disappeared straight up. A Reptilian Humanoid It was after this incident, within a year afterwards, I had a dream that I feel is related somehow. The dream is very clear to me to this day, so maybe it wasn’t just a dream. Maybe it was their way of contacting me without putting fear into me. Maybe they are capable of doing that and I think there is a part of me that believes that is true. I was actually dreaming that I was awoken out of my sleep telepathically from this alien who had just landed on a butte near us."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"F acing east, this is a butte near Terry Jones's Badlands ranch. A year after seeing the diamond light, Terry had an encounter in what she thinks was either a dream, or altered reality. \"In my dream, a reptilian man landed on a ridge at the left side of this butte.\" Photograph © 2007 by Terry Jones. He parked his craft on the butte and is actually hiking down to the ranch where I live to contact me, personally. And he’s letting me know that he’s on his way and I can see him telepathically hiking along this ridge that leads down to the ranch. I know I have to get up and go outside and hike out a little ways beyond the corral behind the house to meet with him. I do, in my dream. T erry describes this photograph: \"The path the reptilian man walked down to the ranch down in the trees you can see in the center distance. It was at the tree line that I met him. The skyline in this picture is facing north, the direction the dancing lights and big diamond light would have been when we saw them from the ranch.\" Photograph © 2007 by Terry Jones. And I get out there and we shake hands. There is really no verbal communication going on, other than he says, ‘I just wanted to meet you.’ And he wants to shake my hand. And instantly there is this bond with this reptilian creature. I feel no threat from him. He’s reptilian to the degree that he’s green, scaly. I remember silver boots on his feet, tall silver boots. I remember he was wearing something else – either like a shield or armor or clothing. I can’t remember. But it was not part of his skin."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"T erry Jones sketched the reptilian man and wrote: \"Over 6-feet-tall, very pleasant demeanor. Seem to remember ears, but not sure about eyes, except color was yellow. High cheekbones. Don't remember the hands, except that he had gloves on. Long legs, skinny. Gloves and boots lighter than colored here, more silver than grey. Smooth, lighter-colored skin on inside of legs.\" COULD YOU SEE EYES, NOSE AND ALL OF THAT? There was something about him that was human, too. That was the really odd part of the dream – the humanness in him is what was putting me at ease. He had an inner strength, like a warrior’s strength about him, and a kindness at the same time. And I felt very honored and privileged that he even wanted to meet me. This was all in dreamland, you know? AND HOW BIG WAS HE COMPARED TO YOU? He was very tall, well over 6 feet tall. I’d say 6 to 7 feet tall. WAS HE MORE MASSIVE IN HIS CHEST AND SHOULDERS? Yes, he was very muscular. I remember him being very – but he was slender, too. He had very long legs, very long arms. The arms were very beefy, but the legs were kind of long and skinny. CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE SCALES IN TERMS OF COLOR, SIZE AND WHAT THEY LOOKED LIKE? I just remember he was kind of mottled, multi-colored. Kind of aqua and kind of dark green. SO THERE WAS BLUE IN THERE AS WELL AS GREEN? Yeah, the aqua. It seemed like on his face, there was a definite small snout at the end of his face that was light colored, lighter color than the rest of him. IF YOU WERE PICKING A REPTILIAN ON THE EARTH THAT YOU KNOW THAT IS CLOSE TO WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE, WHAT WOULD THAT ANIMAL BE? I remember some spikes coming off of him somewhere, like the back of his head maybe, and down his spine. DO YOU THINK OF AN IGUANA, OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"G reen Iguana ( Iguana iguana ), Jalapao Region, Brazilian Cerrado, Brazil. Photograph © by Laurie Vitt, Ph.D. Maybe like an iguana, yeah. But, I thought of a chameleon because I felt his color could change with the environment. He was pretty rough scaled. Very large scaled. SO WOULD IT BE LIKE A STANDING UP ALLIGATOR? Similar. But there was a lot human about him, too. Maybe he is what they call hybrid? I don’t know. He was completely harmless – very gentle in nature, but he also had a very warrior-like – to have him as an ally or somebody who looked out after you would be a good thing. (laughs) That’s just how I felt about him. WHAT RESIDUE HAVE YOU HAD ABOUT WHY THE REPTILIAN IS THERE? Just to make contact. Nothing else. BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK THE RELATIONSHIP IS BETWEEN THE REPTILIAN BEING AND THE NON-HUMANS YOU HAVE SENSED IN THE ZONES OF FEAR? I don’t really see a connection between them. I just know that those zones of fear and the aliens I feel are connected to them don’t have our best interests in mind. BUT THE REPTILIAN DOES? Yeah, does. WHEN YOU THINK OF THE ZONES OF FEAR, WHAT NON-HUMAN COMES TO MIND? The Greys, mostly, just little tiny Greys. Grey, little short ones. AND THAT COMES TO MIND BECAUSE YOU HAVE HAD INTERACTIONS WITH THEM? OR YOU JUST SENSE THEM? No, I just sense them. Zone of Fear: Mental Impression of Grey Non-Humans DO YOU GET IMAGES IN YOUR MIND? I have, yes. Definitely have, up in the mountains – very strongly once. I was in Idaho and working for the Forest Service. For some reason, we had to drive pretty far up into the mountain range to do some road surveying. I was on a road survey crew at that time. There was a road that went up there pretty close to one of the mountain peaks. And I can’t really explain it, but all I know is that this was Grey alien territory. That was all I knew and we should not be there. And the only reason I knew it was Grey alien territory was because I got a clear definite image in my mind of Grey aliens and ships landing there and they did not want us there. THEY DID NOT WANT HUMANS THERE."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"No. WHERE EXACTLY WAS THAT? WHERE WERE YOU WORKING? That was in Targhee National Forest in Idaho. THAT’S ON THE BORDER OF? Right next to Yellowstone Park. NEAR WYOMING. Yes, and near Montana, kind of in that corner there. WHAT YEAR WOULD THAT HAVE BEEN? The mid-1980s. NOW WITH ALL THESE VARIOUS EXPERIENCES IN WYOMING, MONTANA, NORTH DAKOTA, ARIZONA IN WHICH YOU HAVE SENSED ZONES OF FEAR, ZONES OF ‘STAY OUT HUMANS’ - CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT YOU THINK IS BEHIND THOSE ZONES OF FEAR? WHAT EXACTLY WANTS TO KEEP HUMANS OUT? It’s just a hypothesis that they are on their own personal agenda and they don’t want us to be a part of it and they don’t want us humans to be aware of what that is or where they’re at. YOU WOULD SAY IT IS THE LITTLE GREYS. Yeah. I’ve never really connected reptilians to any of that. I think the (reptilian) one I was introduced to through dream state is here probably for different reasons than the ones I’ve connected to those zones of fear. DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF WHAT COULD BE UNFOLDING IN THE FUTURE? Yeah (laughs), I do! I don’t know if people want to hear it. I think we have a lot to look forward to, though. I think that was the message I was getting from this reptilian – that there is a lot of good, a lot of very powerful souls out there that are rooting for us as the human race and they are there to help us. And I’ve had a premonition about this butte where he landed his craft. Some day there will be several smaller craft hovering over this butte. And at that time, there’s a definite energy shift in the air. That’s the only way I know I can describe it. F acing west toward the butte the reptilian landed on in Terry's dream, or altered reality, she writes: \"This is the same butte I have the premonition about seeing UFOs hovering over it in the future.\" P hotograph © 2007 by Terry Jones. IN YOUR MIND’S EYE RIGHT NOW, CAN YOU THINK OF THE BUTTE AND SEE THE IMAGE THAT HAS COME INTO YOUR MIND OF CRAFT OVER THAT BUTTE? There are many craft. LIKE THE SKY IS FILLED WITH CRAFT? No, maybe just like maybe 25 or 30 in the air over this butte."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"AND WHAT ARE THEIR SHAPES? Saucers. THE SAUCERS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH WHICH TYPE OF NON-HUMAN? That’s the part I’m not sure of! (laughs) That hasn’t come to me – just that there will be some kind of contact at that time. And I really don’t know if it’s going to be good or bad. That’s the part I’m confused about.\" More Information: F or further information about unidentified aerial lights and discs, please see reports below in the Earthfiles Archives and my books and documentaries in the Earthfiles Shop: • 02/07/2007 -- Part 11: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue • 12/18/2006 -- Part 6: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue • 12/11/2006 -- Part 5: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue • 11/28/2006 -- Part 2: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue • 11/27/2006 -- Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue © 1957 by Leonard H.
