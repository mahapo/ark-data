July 18, 2005 Northwestern Australia - E-mail from scientist who requests anonymity: July 15, 2005 - Garsington, Oxfordshire, England \"T his new one shows, I think, the precession of Mercury about our Sun: four times a year it becomes visible above the western horizon (two weeks ago for example): hence four white circles. Einstein used the slow advance of Mercury's elliptical orbit (as shown) to deduce his theory of general relativity: namely that motional gravity is slightly stronger than gravity at rest, by a factor of (1 + v2/c2). Converting from acceleration to velocity to distance, by a applying triple time-integral, we get (1 + v2/c2)**3 = (1 + 3 x v2/c2) for small v / c, just as shown in the drawing. For example, the number 1.001 when cubed becomes 1.003 if v / c = 0.001. The angular factor for light bending around our Sun remains (1 + v2/c2) = 1 + 1 = 2, because there it is only acceleration, and v = c. Very intelligent indeed, in my view at least. \" Other UK Crop Formations in July 2005 July 18, 2005 - East Field near Alton Priors, Wiltshire, England "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"C ropcircle Connector reports a second formation in Wiltshire's East Field wheat, reported on July 18, 2005. \"Appears to be about three to four circles in a horizontal line with a straight line at the bottom.\" Aerials upcoming.

July 3, 2005 - Horton near Devizes, Wiltshire, England. Six circles, including the big one that \"crosses the road,\" were reported on July 3, 2005, in crop on the road from Horton to Devizes, Wiltshire, England. Aerial photograph © 2005 by Cropcircleconnector. Stuart Dike of Cropcircleconnector.com writes about this Horton, Wiltshire, formation: \"C rop Circles straddling and crossing roads, is quite a rare occurrence. However it has happened twice this year already, with the Stephen Castle Down formation in Hampshire with its pathway crossing the main highway. On this particular occasion, an actual circle has been completely cut in half by the road. The event itself, has been made even more extraordinary by the fact that one side of the circle is set lower than the other side. This lower part to the circle is separated by a line of long grass which runs parallel with the road. On closer inspection the grass was not affected by the event, just the crop itself. The higher side also included a small ringed circle with a larger intact single circle just behind the straddled circle. In all, this collection of oddball circles had a certain charm to them, which is always important to have running alongside the more celebrated and grander events in Wiltshire. The circle which crosses the road, was even more intriguing when comparing each side. From an aerial perspective we can clearly see that the radius of the circle was not true, if the circle had been made in the proper way in open crop. The question is was its creation affected by the presence of the road, of was it constructed in this way purposely? It was very strange why the long grass along the side of the roadside was not at all disturbed. And this can be said for the grass verge on the open half of"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"the circle.\" July 3, 2005 - Hundred Acres in East Field, Alton Priors, Wiltshire, England E ight-fold star pattern surrounding central square grid pattern, reported on July 3, 2005, in the Hundred Acres section of the huge East Field in Alton Priors, Wiltshire, England.
