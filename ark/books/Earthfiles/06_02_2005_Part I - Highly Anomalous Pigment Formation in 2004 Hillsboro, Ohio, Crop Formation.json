Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Part I - Highly Anomalous Pigment Formation in 2004 Hillsboro, Ohio, Crop Formation © 2005 by Linda Moulton Howe June 2, 2005 Grass Lake, Michigan - In a Hillsboro, Ohio, garden back on July 5, 2004, corn plants were discovered by home owners to be mysteriously flattened in a rough rectangular pattern without any storm links or other natural explanations. Jeffrey Wilson, Director, Independent Crop Circle Researchers Association (ICCRA), in Ohio, forwarded to me an e-mail from the Hillsboro, Ohio, residents, along with a photograph of their affected garden plot of corn. The owners wrote: \"We have what most would refer to as a 'crop circle' in our garden plot of corn. We noticed it yesterday (July 5, 2004). We have contacted the local sheriff's department and he said it did not look like vandalism to him, but rather some type of natural or unexplained phenomena. No one has stepped into it yet, as I thought it might be of interest to someone.\" The unanswered question over the years: Does the same energy that creates the anomalous geometric formations in crops around the world cause randomly downed patterns as well in grass and cereal crops? If the same energy is involved, why are some patterns geometric and others not? Hillsboro, Ohio Hillsboro, Ohio is near the Hopewell ancient mound region where in 2003, there were several complex crop formations in soybeans noted by yellow in the above map.

Jeffrey Wilson and his ICCRA colleague, Ted Robertson, went to investigate, took photographs and sampled plants for examination by Grass Lake, Michigan, biophysicist, W. C. Levengood. Below is an overview of some anomalies found, followed in Part 2 by biophysicist Levengood's May 4, 2005, report detailing \"highly anomalous pigment formation\" in the Hillsboro downed corn. Hillsboro, Ohio, corn plants flattened four layers deep going in different directions. Photograph © 2004 by Jeffrey Wilson. Upper ear of corn has holes in testa where corn silk was attached before hypothesized spinning plasma vortex interacted. It is also smaller than more normal ear below, implying stunted growth which has been documented in other corn formations in previous years. Also in the upper ear, you can see large \"balloon\" kernels that expanded and did not burst.
