October 5, 2003 Havana, Cuba - Three years ago when Paulina Zelitsky and Paul Weinzweig, co-owners of Advanced Digital Communications, saw the first side scan sonar images of the deep water structures off the western tip of Cuba, some underwater objects were dark as metals sometimes show up on magnetometers. I asked Paul if any more data supported the initial cesium magnetometer data which implied there might be metal coatings on some of the megalithic structures.

But again, this is only hypothetical and would need to be verified by visual probes, by an ROV (Remote Operated Video) and cameras and good lighting. The area is quite extensive, spread out over several kilometers and we've barely touched it in terms of video probes. Map of Atlantis based on Plato's descriptions, published in the New York American on October 20, 1912 from Imagining Atlantis © 1998 by Richard Ellis. Metal On Stone in the Atlantis Legend The Greek philosopher, Plato, wrote in his Dialogue called the Critias about the destroyed continent of Atlantis and its walls covered by metals: \"The stone which was used in the work they quarried from underneath the center island, and from underneath the zones, on the outer as well as the inner side. One kind of stone was white, another black, and a third red, and as they quarried, they at the same time hollowed out rocks double within, having roofs formed out of the native rock. ...The entire circuit of the wall, which went round the outermost one, they covered with a coating of brass, and the circuit of the next wall they coated with tin, and the third,m which encompassed the citadel, flashed with the red light of orichalcum (copper or copper alloy). \"...In the center was a holy temple dedicated to Cleito and Poseidon, which remained inaccessible, and was surrounded by an enclosure of gold. ...All the outside of the temple, with the exception of the pinnacles, they covered with silver, and the pinnacles with gold. In the interior of the temple the roof was of ivory, adorned everywhere with gold and silver and orichalcum; all the other parts of the walls and pillars and floor they lined with orichalcum.\" Map of Atlantis by 17th Century German Jesuit scholar and physicist"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Anthanasius Kircher, from Gateway to Atlantis © 2000 by Andrew Collins. Andrew Collins, British researcher of the Caribbean and the Atlantis legend, hypothesizes in his 2000 book, Gateway to Atlantis , that Cuba was in fact part of the great lost continent that sank into the Atlantic around 11,000 years ago. Above : Symbolic drawing made in 1931 by Mayan glyph researcher, James Churchward, depicting a cataclysm of earthquakes and volcanoes that allegedly sank the continent of Mu in the Pacific Ocean. Below : Churchward's map showing how he thought Mu refugees spread out after the cataclysm through South America, along the shores of Atlantis and into Africa. Drawings © 1931 by James Churchward. Collins says, \"I also concluded that Plato's claim that Atlantis's destruction in one single night and day through earthquakes and floods was based on catastrophe legends told to Phoenician and Carthaginian mariners by the indigenous peoples of the Bahamas and Caribbean. They were told first to the Spanish explorers who reached the islands and spoke of a catastrophic event involving a period of darkness, as well as an all-encompassing flood which engulfed a former great land mass, leaving behind the thousands of islands and cays which today make up these same archipelagos. \"In my opinion,\" Collins says, \"these stories relate to a cosmic event which occurred at the end of the last ice age and involved the creation of 500,000 elliptical craters in the eastern United States.\" What Andrew Collins is talking about are the so-called Carolina Bays, which are found across six states and range in size from a few hundred meters to 11 kilometers in length. The latest theories regarding their formation say a comet broke up into thousands of pieces which impacted a wide area, including a large part of the Atlantic Ocean off the U. S., sometime between 8500 to 9,000 B. C. Such an event would have caused super-tsunami waves that would have engulfed the low-lying regions of the Bahamas and Caribbean killing everything in their path."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Thousands of elliptical craters called \"Carolina Bays\" cover parts of North and South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Virginia and Maryland, such as these at Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.

Moreover, Collins points out that Italian academic Emilio Spedicato of Bergamo University proposes that such a comet impact on the Atlantic seaboard of the U. S. most probably catalyzed the retreat of the ice sheets which had covered North America and Europe for up to 40,000 years. With the sudden comet-caused end of the ice age, rising melt water would have drowned low lying regions on a permanent basis. That might be the memory passed on from generation to generation in the Bahamas, Cuba and rest of the Caribbean before and during the age of Plato."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" Giant Skeletons - A Link to Ancient Megalithic Builders? The puzzle about who first peopled Meso-America and when ? - has been further provoked by other archaeological discoveries. In 1967, scientists working a site southeast of Mexico City in Tlapacoya, uncovered a finely made blade of obsidian that was dated to about 21,000 B. C. Near Puebla, Mexico, excavations in the Valsequillo region revealed cultural remains of human groups that were hunting mammoth and other animals with unifacially worked blades that dated to 21,800 B. C. In 2002, anthropologist Dr. Silvia Gonzalez reported new radiocarbon testing on twenty-seven skulls found in Mexico a century ago that are almost 13,000 years old. Remarkably, two of the 100 Mexico skulls were long and narrow as were some elongated skulls found in Mayan excavations and art such as the \"Lord of the Double Scroll\" below, carved in green serpentine by an Olmec artisan centuries ago. Very large and elongated skull found in the Yucatan. Was this a genetic anomaly? Or the result of skull-wrapping in the Serpent priesthood of the Maya? Andrew Collins asks, \"Do such skulls imply an ancestral line in which giantism was present?\" Elongated head carved in green serpentine of what could have been an ancient Olmec ruler. Two faint lines on his right cheek, now barely visible, give the name \"The Lord of the Double Scroll.\" Source: Mysteries of the Ancient Americas © 1986 by The Reader's Digest Association Far East Ltd. The elongated Mexican and Olmec heads are also reminiscent of the long-headed, reptilian humanoids known as Ubaid figurines from Sumeria, carved at least 4,500 years ago. Thousands of terra-cotta figurines from Ur in southern Mesopotamia dating back to about 3500 B. C., depict tall, thin beings with elongated heads and reptilian features. The circles on the body, some have hypothesized, represent reptilian scaly skin.

Ubaid figurines are preserved in a variety of museums around the world, including the British Museum, London, the source of this image. Large Skeleton Discoveries In addition to long, narrow heads, giant skeletons in the 9 to 10 foot range have been discovered in a variety of locations in the world, including a long barrow in England. Further, The New York Times reported on May 4, 1908, \"Giants' Skeletons Found. Cave in Mexico Gives Up the Bones of an Ancient Race.\" The article said that a Mr. Charles Clapp had returned from Mexico where he ran mining interests and said, \"He found a cave containing some 200 skeletons of men each above eight feet in height. The cave was evidently the burial place of a race of giants who preceded the Aztecs. Mr. Clapp arranged the bones of one of the skeletons and found the total length to be 8 feet 11 inches. The head measured eighteen inches from front to back.\" A few years later on June 21, 1924, the Ti mes reported, \"Find Skeleton of Giant. A huge skeleton, believed to be that of a prehistoric human being, has been discovered in the Salmon River country south of Lewiston, Idaho, by two members of the State Highway Department who have brought their find to Lewiston. ...Measuring more than eight feet in height and possessing numerous strange features, the skeleton has aroused widespread intere st. ...Both the upper and lower jaws have only ten teeth each and all are intact.\" That giant skeleton was sent to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D. C. There are many other such reports from the 1900s and through the 20th Century about unusually tall skeletons discovered around our planet. Who were the very tall, long-headed people which possibly preceded the better known human civilizations of Sumeria, Egypt, Europe, North, Central and South America? Could the giant skeletons of the earth be connected to the Atlantis legend, as described by Plato (circa 428 to 347 B. C.), nearly 2,400 years ago? Did those giants build megalithic stone structures around the world that once included land in the Yucatan and the islands to the east from Cuba to the alleged Atlantis?
