In this beautiful Victorian resort town of artists and writers, the dogwood and redbud trees are flowering everywhere as if all were right in the world. Amazon Rain Forest Destruction Accelerating But trees in another part of the planet are not so lucky. This week, the respected science journal Nature published results of an aerial survey of Brazil's Amazon rain forest. Aerial photographs show the rain forest is being destroyed, or badly damaged, more than TWICE as fast as believed. Ecologist Daniel Nepstad of the Woods Hole Research Center in Massachusetts said 17,000 square miles of Amazon rain forest was destroyed in 1998 alone. The official Brazilian government estimate in 1998 was only 5700 square miles, a much lower false number to be more politically acceptable. Dr. Nepstad says that conservatively at least 16% of the original Amazon rain forest has been destroyed and continues to be at an accelerating rate. Scientists have long warned that the rain forests must be preserved because they are home to one-third of the world's plant and animal species. Dr. Robert Sanford, a University of Denver ecologist said: \"As we lose species, we don't know which one is the critical one, the keystone species that results in the whole system falling apart.\" The researchers also worry about huge quantities of carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere from all the files and rotting wood left by the loggers which contributes to another big planetary problem: global warming. Organizations such as The Nature Conservancy are trying to buy rain forest land to protect it, and I urge radio listeners to contact The National Conservancy to find out how you can help.

Toxic Rain Water in Europe In other disturbing environmental news, researchers at the Swiss Federal Institute for Environment Science and Technology report that rain falling in Europe is so full of toxic pesticides that much of it is too dangerous to drink. Dr. Stephen Muller said European rain water samples contained so much pesticide 2-4-dinitrophenol that the amounts were four times limits set by the European Union for safe drinking water. Strange Lights in Missouri In other news, two hundred miles north of where we are now in Arkansas, 40 residents of a farm community in Missouri have been seeing brilliant, glowing "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"spheres forming various patterns since December 15th, 1989 to this first week of April 1999. Four of the eyewitnesses have managed to capture some of the mysterious glowing spheres on videotape. The investigator who is studying the situation is Ted Phillips. Mr. Phillips is a civil engineer well known for documenting physical traces associated with unidentified aerial objects. Back in 1968, when Ted Phillips worked for the Missouri Department of Transportation, he became involved in an investigation in which daylight photographs taken by a hunter showed a silver disc moving away from a burning pine tree and a tent full of melted aluminum pots, radios, cameras and other camping equipment. The implication was that the disc had somehow caused the destructive heat. Ted called Northwestern University's Astronomy Department for help and the man who answered the phone was Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Director of the Astronomy Department at the time. Dr. Hynek was also a consultant to the U. S. Air Force Project Blue Book which investigated UFO reports. Dr. Hynek urged Ted Phillips to keep researching and since 1968, Ted has compiled a data base of some 4,000 physical trace cases associated with unidentified aerial objects and personally has investigated about 600 cases, including this recent series of close encounters with glowing spheres in Missouri. Photographs and video frames taken at various times and by different people are on his web site at: Center for Physical Trace Research. On March 3rd, 1999, Ted saw the spheres with his own eyes and was stunned.
