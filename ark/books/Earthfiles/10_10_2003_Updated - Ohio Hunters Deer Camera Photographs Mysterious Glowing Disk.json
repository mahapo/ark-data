October 10, 2003 Aberdeen, Ohio - Since August, I have reported about two extraordinary crop formations of unknown origin in Ohio soybeans. The first was near the ancient earthworks known as the Serpent Mound between Locust Grove and Peebles, Ohio. The second was on Paint Creek island near the ancient Seip Mound in Bainbridge, Ohio, about 30 miles north of the Serpent Mound. Paint Creek was reported September 28 by a local newspaper after a pilot flew over it. The exact date of its creation is not known, but investigators think it was probably created the same time as the Serpent Mound pattern first discovered on August 24, 2003. A third pattern resembling a Mercedes-Benz hood ornament was reported on September 9, but turned out to be manmade. Jeffrey Wilson and his research colleagues reported what seemed to be military interest in the crop patterns. See: 10/03/03 Earthfiles . I have also reported about British military activity over Wiltshire, England crop formations and a Ministry of Defence insider's statement that the military uses infrared cameras and other equipment to track down mysterious lights associated with crop pattern creations, of which \"95% are invisible to the human eye.\" On September 23rd, five days before the impressive Paint Creek formation was reported, a resident of Aberdeen, Ohio, 30 miles southwest of the Serpent Mound near the Kentucky border, had his automatic \"deer camera\" running at a salt lick. Update - Camera Model "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Stealth Cam, Model MC2-G, 35mm Infrared Motion Detector Scouting Camera. Can be purchased from: Stealth Cam, LLC 805 W.N. Carrier Parkway, Suite 260 Grand Prairie, Tx, 75050 Phone: 877-269-8490. The camera was camouflaged in deep grass so it could not be easily seen. He wanted to find out how many does and bucks were there and how old they were. The camera is equipped with motion detection and infrared heat sensors and was loaded with 400 ASA print film. Once the camera is triggered by either motion or heat or both, it will take one frame every six minutes until the triggering event is gone. When 56-year-old Michael Franklin saw the prints from one of two rolls his camera filmed on September 23, he was shocked to see a white disk in the clear blue sky near the tree line. More frames on the roll contained a bright sun-like object surrounded by a halo. The film was old and the prints have a blue cast to them, but the camera store processor examined the negatives and said the anomalies are in the film and not a processing defect. First frame of second roll of 400 ASA film taken by motion and heat sensitive \"deer camera\" on September 23, 2003, in Aberdeen, Ohio, 30 miles south of the Serpent Mound. Two rolls of film were shot that day. The first roll was completely normal and contained images of deer. The second roll began with the anomalous print above that was followed by normal and a few more anomalous images. Photograph © 2003 by Michael Franklin. Interview: Michael Franklin, Owner, Hawg Knives, Aberdeen, Ohio: \"And I saw that disk and my stomach just hit the floor. I just couldn't believe it. I just kind of sat there looking at this thing. I know this area like the back of my hand. I've been here 13 years and to see that disk on there was absolutely flabbergasting. I have it set up so that when the camera is triggered, it takes one picture every six minutes if that motion detector is still there. If the animal is there in six minutes, then it will take another picture and it will take another picture every six minutes until that trigger is gone. I've had the camera up there approximately a month and I've taken several rolls of film, all of which had deer in them. I was very pleased with the results. In fact when we took the last two rolls for processing, one of the rolls was perfect. It had lots of deer and very good pictures of them. Then the second roll was not exactly what we had been expecting because it had the disk on the very first photograph. The camera faces almost due west right where the setting sun would be, but there are no shadows anywhere, which means the sun was pretty high in the sky. The progression of the way the object moves is from west to east. WHICH IS THE OPPOSITE OF THE SUN'S TRAVEL."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Right. WHAT TIME WAS THIS? Probably between 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. There were no shadows at all because the sun was high in the sky. IF I UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M LOOKING AT: THE FIRST FRAME THAT WAS TAKEN HAS THE WHITE OVAL IN THE SKY. THE NEXT FRAME, WOULD IT HAVE BEEN 6 MINUTES LATER? Ye s . IT WAS COMPLETELY NORMAL? Yes, the next two frames after the first one were normal. Frames 2 and 3 do not have a disc or lights in them, but Frame 3 below and others that followed are a bit wider than the first two frames for unknown reason and a large shadow appears in the lower left corner. All photographs © 2003 by Michael Franklin. Frame 4 has a very bright light and halo seemingly close to the top of the tree. Mike Franklin estimates the focus was about 30 feet from the \"deer camera.\" The fourth photo had a glowing 'disk' with an aura coming off it. What we don't know is if some how the camera mechanism was compromised. I guess it was possible. If you figured up the 6 minutes per frame, this thing (light) was around"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"for over 2 hours, which is amazing. (Six minutes times 24 frames = 144 minutes.) The bright disc with the aura is in front of the treeline. The trees are approximately 50 yds. away from the camera. The camera normally has a range of 30 to 40 ft. for motion and heat. Also, in the last two photos you can see the white \"cloud\" or whatever coming in from ground level on the right. It eventually goes almost across the photo and then goes back to the right, disappearing. WOULD THIS CAMERA HAVE BEEN TRIGGERED DURING THE DAYLIGHT HOURS BY INFRARED? Yes, it could be triggered by any heat source. If there was a heat source within that area, then it would have triggered the camera. Frame 5 has shafts of light on the far left side of the print. Frame 6 below was taken six minutes later and there is a faint glow in the upper left corner of the print. HAVE YOU SHOWN THESE PHOTOGRAPHS TO ANY PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHER OR SCIENTIST OR TO ANYBODY TO GET THEIR FEEDBACK? We took them back to the people who processed them. The weird thing is that when we first looked at the pictures, they were out of order. So, the disk picture was the only one we thought was really weird. The other pictures we just assumed were the sun. Then we got to looking and said, 'If that was the sun, where is it on the rest of these pictures?' And it's going backwards (right to left in frames which is west to east) and we figured that out. My wife and I talked a long time about even making these pictures public because we watch all those shows about being abducted and all that stuff. We have jokes about it and then the crop circles hit and we heard about that. And then these photographs surfaced, which believe me, I did not ask for! We talked about not letting anyone see them simply because of what we thought might be misconstrued and a lot of publicity. But then it just seemed like it wouldn't be right to have these photographs and not show anybody. It's not just one picture it's a whole bunch of pictures. WHAT THE HECK DOES IT MEAN AND WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THIS REGION OF OHIO WITH SO MUCH PHENOMENA?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Yes, that's what the newspaper said. There were people who came and did electromagnetic testing at the crop site and I think they said the amount of electromagnetic energy was very high at those sites. IT'S TRUE THAT THEY FOUND A LOT OF ANOMALIES. I'VE DONE A LOT OF INVESTIGATION OF CROP FORMATIONS IN ENGLAND AND OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD, AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS CONSTANTLY LINKED ARE MYSTERIOUS LIGHTS. THIS SUMMER WHEN I WAS IN ENGLAND, I INTERVIEWED A MAN WHO TALKED WITH SOME OFF THE RECORD WHO WORKS FOR THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT. HE TOLD MY RESEARCHER FRIEND THAT HE KNEW FOR A FACT THAT BRITISH MILITARY WERE TRACKING ENERGY SYSTEMS IN THE CROP FIELDS THAT COULD ONLY BE SEEN IN INFRARED AND OTHER FREQUENCIES THAT WERE OUTSIDE THE RANGE OF THE HUMAN EYE. Makes sense, doesn't it? BUT WHAT ARE THEY? We are technologically pretty advanced. Well, these guys, if they are coming from some place else are extremely more advanced. So, why would they even let us see them when we have things that are not visible on radar. So, they must have some way to cover or cloak their ships or whatever.\" More Information: To read about the crop formations at the Serpent and Seip Mounds and eyewitness accounts of military presence in the that Ohio area, please see the Earthfiles.com reports below: · 10/05/2003 -- Part 3 - Paint Creek Island, Ohio Crop Formation Photographs · 10/03/2003 -- Part 2 - Military Interest in Serpent Mound and Seip Mound Formations? · 10/02/2003 -- Part 1 - Another Soybean Formation Near Seip Mound in Ohio · 09/12/2003 -- 2nd Soybean Crop Formation in Ohio is Manmade.
