In 1974, the NICAP investigator who contributed the above information also worked as an undercover detective for the Bernalillo County Sheriff’s Department in Albuquerque. Randal Hecker is now retired and living in Gunnison, Colorado. Mr. Hecker also ran into blocking cards in the Albuquerque newspaper files and began our interview with events he learned off the record from Kirtland AFB sources about other disc-related events before May 28, 1974. Interview: Randal Hecker, former NICAP investigator, 1974 - 1980; organized crime undercover investigator, Bernalillo County Sheriff's Office, Albuquerque, 1974; EMP Paramedic in New Mexico, 1977-1991; now retired in Gunnison, Colorado: May 17, 1974 \"COULD YOU GO TO MAY 17, 1974, AND WHAT I UNDERSTAND WAS A CRASH AND RETRIEVAL BY KIRTLAND AFB OF SOME KIND OF DISC FROM CHILILI, NEW MEXICO, IN THE MANZANO MOUNTAINS? I worked with a number of people at Kirtland AFB and Sandia Base on a ‘no name’ basis (confidentiality). I convinced them I would never reveal their names and I never have. So, they were willing to supply information. And one of my sources told me that an object had crashed west of Chilili during that time period of May 17, 1974, and that Kirtland AFB personnel had recovered it. It was flown back to Kirtland AFB by a couple of helicopters with very large wires suspending the disc between the copters."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"THEY WOULD HAVE TO DO THAT AT NIGHT, WOULDN’T THEY? Yes, the removal was done at night. IS THERE ANYBODY YOU HAVE TALKED TO, FIRST, SECOND OR THIRD HAND, WHO HAS GIVEN YOU DETAILS ABOUT WHAT PRECISELY TIME OF DAY THE DISC CRASHED IN CHILILI AND WHAT HAPPENED? If I remember correctly, I believe it was an afternoon crash. It was picked up on radar. Air Force helicopters were in the air very quickly after it crashed. A source told me there seemed to be a magnetic anomaly in the Manzano Mountains that affected some discs back then. The military originally took over old Manzano Mountain gold mines that were there because a whole bunch of gold was taken out of that mountain. The government just moved in and said ‘Eminent Domain,’ chased everyone out and put nuclear weapons in there. But then they expanded from there, so now a great deal of the Coyote test facility is underground. I’ve seen part of it from the air. It is big! And it has a lot of things in Coyote Canyon that are very highly classified. AND MIGHT INCLUDE A RETRIEVED DISC OR TWO? Definitely. There’s a door there that opens up and is horizontal that I’ve flown over twice. It’s almost 150 feet across. They say it’s for testing lasers. WHY WOULD THEY NEED A 150-FOOT-WIDE DOOR TO TEST LASERS? I have no idea. May 19, 1974 “ There was a sighting that began around May 19, 1974, that involved twelve glowing objects passing from south to north over Albuquerque. They were not bright objects, but they were circular and they triggered a magnetic detector as they passed over the northeastern part of Albuquerque. My source, hearing the magnetic detector go off, went outside to watch and he saw the objects pass overhead. May 28, 1974 OK, LET’S MOVE TO MAY 28, 1974. COULD YOU START BY DETAILING THE EVENTS THAT MORNING THAT WERE IN NICAP's UFO INVESTIGATOR ? First around 2 AM, a man had just gotten home from a late night job to an east-facing apartment near the Sandia foothills. He wondered what the light was shining in his window from above. At first, he thought it was what was called the ‘505 Police’ airplane. So he got up and looked outside. Instead of an airplane, he saw this large object in the sky. He walked out into the yard and watched it set down in the Sandia hills and stay there for a long time. He did not see anybody surround it. He did not see anybody else go up there. But he said it was on the ground for about 90 minutes before it took off to the south. Later, after the sun was up, an aerial object shaped \"like viewing a coin on end\" was seen by a woman washing dishes. She called her husband out and they watched the odd aerial object together. In the sky, the object moved north and then turned to the east following Tijeras Canyon (not far from Chilili and Coyote Canyon). During that time, they did not hear any unusual sound. There were no jet aircraft in the air going after it, either. WASN’T THAT THE EYEWITNESS ACCOUNT WHERE THEY COULD SEE THE DISC SPINNING AROUND A CENTRAL CORE? Yes, they could see it spinning and wobbling gently as it moved along. Then it turned and followed I-40 (which divides the Sandias from the Manzano Mountains). WHAT THIS UNDERSCORES IS THAT ON THE MORNING OF MAY 28, 1974, IN THE SANDIA HILLS REGION ON THE EASTERN OUTSKIRTS OF ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO, AT LEAST THREE RESIDENTS WERE SEEING DISC-SHAPED OBJECTS THAT WERE HOVERING OR ON THE GROUND OR MOVING AND WOBBLING. Ye s ."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"WAS THE DISC HANGING AROUND BECAUSE IT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE SOME KIND OF MEETING WITH MILITARY AGENCIES OR SOMEBODY FROM KIRTLAND AFB, AS WE NOW KNOW HAD OCCURRED IN APRIL 1964, DOWN IN HOLLOMAN AFB, NEW MEXICO? “Big Blue” At Kirtland AFB This is something I cannot confirm, but I was told by one of my military sources at the time that there was an object, which they had learned how to reverse-engineer from crashed spacecraft that they affectionately called ‘Big Blue’ that was coming into Kirtland AFB at that time for new pilots to load on for training purposes. NEW PILOTS TO LOAD ON? Yes, for training purposes so they could learn how to fly it. YOU UNDERSTOOD THAT TO MEAN AMERICAN PILOTS? Well, I asked my source if he meant that extraterrestrials landed there? He said, ‘No, no, they are Air Force guys.’ PAUL MC KEEVER SAID THAT ALL THE MILITARY SECURITY RINGING THAT DISC WERE FACING IT WITH M-16S AND THAT EVERYONE WAS ABOUT 50 FEET AWAY FROM THE DISC AS IF THEY WERE ON GUARD. THAT DOES NOT SOUND LIKE THE SO-CALLED ‘BIG BLUE.’ No, it doesn’t and we may very well be talking about different things. SO YOU MIGHT NOT EVEN HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE ABOUT WHAT OCCURRED THERE AT 9 PM ON MAY 28, 1974? I may not because the witness I talked to said it was about 2 AM. So, we’re looking at a repeat (of discs hanging around the Sandias from early morning to night on May 28, 1974.) DID the 2 AM DISC ALSO SEEM TO BE GLOWING AND HOVERING? Ye s . WHEN IT TOOK OFF, WHAT DID IT DO? It headed to the south at a fairly low altitude over the southern end of Albuquerque and went over the Manzano Mountains over the nuclear facilities there (inside the Coyote Canyon E.R.D.A. nuclear storage and Lurance Canyon burn sites). Hecker Found Albuquerque Newspaper Censorship About Nuclear Events WHAT WAS THE MOST DRAMATIC EVENT IN 1974 THAT YOU PERSONALLY INVESTIGATED? Oh, golly, there were so many! There was so much going on at that time. But I would say that the most dramatic event was that I had full access to the Albuquerque Journal/Tribune morgue files at the newspapers. But by 1978, it was all cut off. All my access to the Sheriff’s Department, to the Police Department and all my sources at the military went silent. So, in their opinion, something happened. WHAT YOU MEAN IS THAT IN 1974, YOU WERE STILL ABLE TO ACCESS FILES SUCH AS THE ALBUQUERQUE JOURNAL ON EVENTS... Ye s . ...BUT FOUR YEARS LATER IN 1978, THERE WERE BLACK OUTS ON SOME STORIES AND ALL SOURCES WERE CUT OFF? Ye s . HAD YOU EVER FOUND BLOCKING CARDS IN THE ALBUQUERQUE NEWSPAPERS BEFORE?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"I found a couple that blocked nuclear stuff out at Sandia Base that turned up in other newspapers. And I found some that blocked Russian nuclear developments that turned up in other newspapers. So, I can’t tell you – it might have just been the stuff going on at Sandia Base, which is where we developed part of our nuclear facilities. BUT RANDY, WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS, THAT THERE WAS OBVIOUSLY A HABIT AT THE ALBUQUERQUE JOURNAL/TRIBUNE TO BLOCK OUT DATA, ESPECIALLY RELATED TO SANDIA AND NUCLEAR EVENTS. THAT IMPLIES THAT SOMEBODY WAS SAYING, ‘PUT A BLOCKING CARD.’ Yes, that’s the way it appears. I just figured it was the government silencing everything. 4,000-Foot-Long Cylinder At White Sands in 1955 S an Andres Mountains (red underline) form western boundary of White Sands Missile Range, which was called White Sands Proving Ground back in the 1940s to 1950s.

WHAT ABOUT THE 1955 WHITE SANDS EVENT WHEN THE VERY LARGE OBJECT LANDED THERE?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"OK, the San Andreas Mountains form the west side of the White Sands Missile Range in southern New Mexico. On the east side of the San Andreas Mountains, there is a big canyon. You can see it from a long ways off. In the summer of 1955 (June to July), radar detected a very large object swiftly going into this canyon. At first, they thought it was a meteor because it was so fast. So, they sent out a patrol of military police to find it and see if they could dig up a meteor. Instead, what they found was an object sitting in this canyon that stretched from one side of the canyon to the other at points the object just about touched. They later measured it was 4,000 feet long. THAT’S MORE THAN HALF A MILE! I know. This 4,000-foot-long object was tubular in shape and had windows running down its sides. And there were beings inside looking out! The MPs took a number of close-up photographs, hauled the film in, and all over the missile range, theodolite cameras were set up in front of radar scopes to try to image this thing. Very shortly thereafter, it climbed into outer space at about 10 mph. So, White Sands got a huge amount of pictures, both theodolite and radar scope pictures. [ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - “A theodolite is an instrument for measuring both horizontal and vertical angles, as used in triangulation networks. It is a key tool in surveying and engineering work, but theodolites have been adapted for other specialized purposes in fields like meteorology and rocket launch technology. A modern theodolite consists of a telescope mounted movably within two perpendicular axes, the horizontal or trunnion axis, and the vertical axis. When the telescope is pointed at a desired object, the angle of each of these axes can be measured with great precision, typically on the scale of arcseconds.” L eft: Circa 1950, U.S. National Geodetic Survey technicians observing with a 0.2 arcsecond resolution Wild T-3 theodolite mounted on an observing stand. Photo was taken during an Arctic field party. Credit: NOAA. Right: An optical theodolite, manufactured in the Soviet Union in 1958 and used for topographic surveying. ] White Sands called in a radar specialist, a Mr. Eilar, from the West Coast to examine the radar scope pictures. Mr. Eilar told me there were 16,000 feet of radar scope pictures from various places around White Sands and that he had absolutely no explanation for what it was. But it was big and it was metallic. He said he did not have a security classification high enough to see the theodolite pictures, but he knew they existed. THE THEODOLITE PICTURES WOULD HAVE GIVEN WHAT DATA? They would have given the azimuth, they would have given the elevation, given the time and potentially a split image. They would have been able to track it virtually all the way up to the upper atmosphere like they were doing V-2s at the time. DID HE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL THE FOOTAGE OF THE 4,000- FOOT-LONG TUBULAR METAL OBJECT? He just said it was shipped some place. DID YOU EVER TALK WITH ANYBODY ELSE IN THE MILITARY THERE WHO SAW IT? I talked with the son of one of the military police. His father at that time had died the year"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"before. And the California radar expert. They verified that the event had happened. An Alien Hybrid Program? YOU’RE 60-YEARS-OLD AS WE SPEAK IN DECEMBER 2007. That’s correct. AFTER A LONG CAREER IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND DOING INVESTIGATIONS FOR NICAP, WHAT IS YOUR OWN BOTTOM LINE RIGHT NOW ON WHAT THE DISC INTELLIGENCE IS. WHAT IT WANTS AND WHAT ITS RELATIONSHIP IS WITH THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT? The relationship with the United States government, I believe, is fairly simple to look at. In WWII and 1947 when discs started to crash, the government looked at this as a big means of getting ahead of the Russians. So, they classified everything on an absolute Need To Know basis to give them technology that would give them an edge over the Russians. But at the time, they did not realize that the Russians were also getting crashed objects. I don’t believe the objects were crashes. I believe they were implants (planned crashes) to get us to work with the aliens, to get the Earth to open up to what they wanted to do. And to get our governments to make relationships with the aliens on their terms. WHAT TERMS DO YOU THINK THEY WANT? Well, they obviously want to do some form of hybridization with human beings. For what purposes? I don’t know. But all the abductions certainly hint in that direction. And then there are all the animal mutilations, which as you wrote long ago, are \"a strange harvest\" of genetic material. DO YOU HAVE ANY INTUITIVE SENSE ABOUT WHAT THE HYBRIDIZATION PROGRAM WOULD BE FOR? My intuitive sense is that they might be trying to bring something out that can’t be here right now – might be trying to make a physical body for something that can’t come here at the moment. DO YOU THINK ALL THE FACTS AND TRUTH SHOULD BE PRESENTED TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC? Absolutely! I do believe at this point, we can deal with it. For a long time, I did not think we could. But I believe right now in the 21st Century that we can deal with it as a race. AND WE CERTAINLY DESERVE TO KNOW THE FACTS THAT OUR OWN SO-CALLED REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT KNOWS. Absolutely, in more areas than just this. Something was proposed to me once: What would you do if a UFO landed on the White House lawn? How would we handle it? Well, the first thing that would happen is security would grab it. The second thing that would happen is that the government would classify it. The third thing that would happen is the president would deny it. And they would do that not only to us, but to everyone else (on Earth) because they would not want to know that by chance we had a slight edge over them (rest of world). In the process, the government makes enemies out of potential friends, they turn America against itself, and they develop a government, which is almost conspiratorial for the people it represents. ESSENTIALLY IT IS A GOVERNMENT OF LIES THAT KEEPS LYING TO PERPETUATE LIES. Absolutely. The UFO technology has given us a tremendous monetary system to a few people – particularly so if it’s true that we have developed our own spacecraft in that area. Power, money – you get something that’s like 1,000 years ahead of everybody else – that’s money! That’s money beyond the comprehension of most Americans and it’s eventually going to go into somebody’s hands who is going to do anything in the world they can to keep it coming. They (government) want to keep hiding it forever, as far as I’m concerned, and they will never make a disclosure of it voluntarily. I don’t think there is anyone who ever will because there is too much money involved, too much power, too much greed. Greed begets greed. The only thing I would tell people is that ultimately, it’s your decision out there as to whether you want to know the truth or not. If you want to know it, then you need to get"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"behind people who are seeking it and support them!” I am hoping that others will contact me who were also in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on May 28, 1974, at the Sandia hills on the eastern edge of the city beyond Menaul and Tramway Boulevards, watching the glowing disc surrounded by military - or were one of the military security police.
