June 24, 2006 Edmonton, Alberta, Canada - On June 22, the National Academy of Sciences officially reported to Congress \"a high level of confidence\" that Earth is the warmest it’s been in at least 400 years. There is also proxy evidence as far back as 900 A.D., more than eleven hundred years ago. In its press release, the Academy stated: “There is sufficient evidence from tree rings, boreholes, retreating glaciers, and other ‘proxies’ of past surface temperatures to say with a high level of confidence that the last few decades of the 20th century were warmer than any comparable period in the last 400 years.” The news release also stated there was less data from the preceding millennia. But there is evidence that several Earth locations were “warmer during the past 25 years than during any other 25-year period since 900 A.D.” A top panel of climate scientists produced the NAS report for the House Science Committee, which last November requested official comment from the National Academy of Sciences about whether global warming is a major threat. Not only did the NAS report support the facts of definite global warming from the 20th to the 21st centuries, the scientific panel concluded that “human activities are responsible for much of the recent warming.” "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"\"Hockey Stick\" Graph of Global Warming: 1000 - 2005 A.D.

Polar Bears Threatened With Extinction O nly one week before the official National Academy of Sciences report to Congress – thirty climate scientists signed a letter to the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service requesting that the polar bear be put on the threatened species list. The polar bear’s potential extinction was laid out in the letter this way: “As scientists engaged in research on climate change, we are deeply concerned about the effect of Arctic warming on the polar bear habitat. Biologists have determined that sea-ice is critical in the life cycle of the polar bear and the survival of the polar bear as a species. Under the Endangered Species Act, the Fish and Wildlife Service is required to list a species for protection if it is in danger of extinction or threatened by possible extinction in all, or a significant portion of, its range. The ongoing and projected increased loss of sea-ice in the warming Arctic poses a significant threat to the polar bear.” The letter from climate scientists to the federal agency also states that “the best available observations demonstrate that Arctic warming is rapid, persistent, and widespread,” and that only a reduction in human- caused greenhouse gas emissions can prevent further Arctic warming and sea-ice melting. As the Arctic ice melts and polar bears have been forced to walk longer distances to hunt for food, three sad phenomena are increasing: drownings, cannibalism and declining pregnancies. This week I talked about the unthinkable, but possible, extinction of polar bears with a Canadian zoologist who has studied the magnificent animals since 1984. He is Andrew Derocher, Ph.D., Prof. of Biological Sciences in the Biological Sciences Centre at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Interview: Andrew Derocher, Ph.D., Prof. of Biological Sciences, Biological Sciences Centre, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Albe rta, Canada: “The problem is that the bears rely on finding that ice as they migrate northward as the ice starts to melt. Of course, if they keep moving northward and the ice keeps melting, eventually we are going to see probably more of these drowning events. That would be one of the major concerns. But a lot of the impacts are a lot more insidious and difficult to monitor. You have to think that if the sea ice is retreating several hundred miles or kilometers over time, that we’re asking the bears to walk longer and longer distances in a given year to get to areas where they can make a living and hunt seals successfully. If you are using your energy to walk, you can’t use that energy to reproduce. This is where some of the more subtle effects are coming in with reduced recruitment into the populations."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"P olar bears are having to walk longer distances to hunt seals. Four polar bears were desperate enough for food, they turned to cannibalism in 2006. WOULD THAT EXPLAIN ALSO WHY THE POLAR BEARS MIGHT BE SEEKING EACH OTHER OUT IN CANNIBALISM IN ORDER TO EAT? We have seen cannibalism in polar bears before. It has been documented. It’s an uncommon event. It appears there are some individuals that when they become desperate – and these individuals are usually large, adult males – they become desperate and will start to prey on their own species. It’s not common. What’s really unusual about the most recent findings is that this population has been studied in Canada and Alaska for over 30 years at different intensities over time. And nothing like this has ever been seen before. Then all of a sudden in one year to see three events like this is a concern. We did find another example of this when I was out this last spring as well. So now we are looking at four cases in a relatively short period of time. It’s a concern because normally when we think about bears killing other bears, the normal pattern is that males will sometimes try to kill the offspring of a female so that they can get a reproductive opportunity with the mother. In this case, what’s actually happening is that the bears are killing the adult females and then subsequently consuming them. That’s a great concern for us because anything that alters the survival rates of adult females very quickly changes the population trajectory. So, what we are talking about is a population decline that’s mediated by cannibalism. We don’t know how extensive this is, but when you look at the size of the area that this population is covering and the chances of even finding these events is pretty uncommon. So, we’re pretty certain that there are probably many more instances that are going undetected out there. My guess is that if polar bears are going to persist, it’s going to be in the very high latitudes in the Canadian Archipelago and perhaps in the very most northern regions of Greenland where we will – even the most pessimistic computer models for sea ice predict we will still have annual ice forming at very high latitudes. So that’s still going to provide some habitat for polar bears. The problem is really trying to determine how much of that is going to exist and whether or not it will be adequate to maintain populations of seals upon which the polar bears rely (for food). BECAUSE THAT ECOSYSTEM IS CHANGING AS THE GLOBE GETS WARMER AND WARMER. AS SOMEBODY WHO HAS STUDIED POLAR BEARS SINCE THE 1980S, WHAT IS YOUR EDUCATED SPECULATION ABOUT WHETHER THE LAST POLAR BEAR WILL DIE AND WE WILL TRULY HAVE SEEN THIS GREAT SPECIES GO INTO EXTINCTION IN THIS CENTURY? I guess I refuse to bel i eve that humans coul d be so i nsensi ti ve to the gl obal condition that w e w on’t fi nd a solution. I have to confess that. Day to day, polar bears are what I study and research and have worked with for many years now and the concept that they could go to extinction because of lack of action on a global basis is just too depressing to sort of fathom. So, I guess my belief is that I’m hoping that technology and a political will come forward and create solutions that will reduce the global warming patterns that we are seeing. I hope it’s in time. It would be very difficult to maintain a research program and perspective in the long term if I thought they would actually go extinct. I just find that too depressing to fathom. BUT IF THE EARTH DOES NOT GET ITS ACT TOGETHER ON CO2 AND METHANE EMISSIONS, ON THE OTHER SIDE OF WHAT YOU JUST SAID IS POLAR BEAR EXTINCTION. I think that’s quite likely so. It depends really on which of the climate warming scenarios actually come to pass. We know certainly that high latitude areas are warming faster than mid-latitude areas and the ice scientists are clearly indicating that major changes are coming. They have already occurred. We know that. It really depends on what level of climate warming we actually end up seeing and whether or not humans can stabilize greenhouse gasses to at least moderate some of the warming patterns and perhaps stabilize at levels that would allow polar bears to persist.”"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"M other polar bear and kid.
