S. Marine, Camp Lejeune, NC September 23, 2008 Camp Lejeune, Jacksonville, North Carolina - Recently I received an email from a U. S. Marine stationed at Camp Lejeune, near Jacksonville, North Carolina. [ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - Camp Lejeune is home to the II Marine Expeditionary Force, 2nd Marine Division, three other major Marine commands, and a Naval hospital. The main base is supplemented by four satellite facilities: Camp Geiger, Stone Bay, Courthouse Bay, Camp Johnson, and the latest addition to the facility, the Greater Sandy Run Training Area. When added to the main base and MCAS Cherry Point, they make up the largest concentration of Marines and U.S. Navy sailors in the world.] He has been in the Marine Corps for two years and wanted me to know about a startling aerial incident he watched back on Friday, May 21, 2008, and has not disclosed until now. In early May, 2008, I had reported in 050208 Earthfiles about a glowing, pearlescent sphere that “crashed” in Decatur, Alabama, the night of April 25, 2008. The 3-foot- diameter sphere, according to eyewitnesses, was retrieved by military in an ambulance driven to an unnamed installation in Huntsville, Alabama. The Camp Lejeune emailer later heard a rebroadcast of my news update about the Decatur incident on Coast to Coast AM with George Noory that reminded him of what he had encountered. Subject: May 2008 weird light/orb on Marine Corps Airbase Cherry Point, NC Date: September 22, 2008 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com “Miss Howe, I am a United States Marine stationed at Camp Lejeune, NC. I have been in the Marine Corps for a couple of years, almost, and this incident occurred on Friday, 21 May, 2008, at or around 2000/8:00 PM. I don't believe in UFOs or that aliens would visit us, but I cannot come up with any explanation for what I saw. I heard an old Coast to Coast AM recording my friend passed on to me (I intend to listen to that show when I return from deployment to Iraq. I really like you and George, and I'm up late anyway) and you were talking about such things, and it seemed to click with what I saw, and I feel very uncomfortable about everything. I have never told anyone this, and I made this e-mail as a pretext for security's sake, and registered it, and am sending you this e-mail, from behind a proxy server that should give an ISP somewhere in Germany. I'm telling you this because I want you to know that I take this really seriously and I'm concerned about people knowing what I saw and the dumb shit I was doing. To begin with, I had weekend liberty from Camp Lejeune that Friday, May 21, 2008, starting pretty early. I didn't have much to do, or much money, and I had heard from a friend in the air wing that there were a bunch of neat and poorly maintained roads out in the middle of Cherry Point airbase. I could get in and out with no problem, because Marines are generally allowed onto other Marine bases with little or no questions asked, and since it was the weekend, there probably wasn't any training going on, and I could drive the dirt roads at any speed I pleased with no disturbances and few problems. I also brought my Mossberg shotgun, which I had recently updated with night-sights (Tritium vials, so you can get a sight picture in the dark), so I thought I would stay late, and see how they worked shooting targets at night, and that's exactly what I started out doing. I also took my Nikon DSLR and my lenses for it, in case "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"there was something cool to shoot pictures of. I'm apprehensive of going into some details, because technically I probably wasn't supposed to be back there, and I certainly wasn't supposed to be tearing up the dirt roads in my awd import like I was, and the Marine Corps doesn't know that I have my shotgun, and I definitely wasn't supposed to be shooting that out there, even though I was being very safe with it, as most Marines are with any sort of weapon. Further, when I stopped at the PX on base, I bought some beer that was on sale, along with some soda and other crap. I figured I'd drink the beer when I got back to my barracks, and that I might as well pick it up here as on Camp Lejeune, whose smaller PX is never stocked as well, and on Friday night is very, very crowded with Marines buying beer or other liquors. I drove around the trails for a while, enjoying driving dangerously with out having to worry about police, MPs, or bystanders, and I would pause to rest or make a head call and to take in the scenery, take a couple shots with my Nikon, mostly to familiarize myself with it, as I'm pretty new to digital photography. It started to get dark out, and I found a good place to do some shooting. It was a small clearing, pretty far removed from anywhere (I don't even know if I was on government property), and had a gently sloping hill that would make a backdrop to shoot into. I set up my empty soda cans and started shooting. I was enjoying myself until I heard helicopters in the distance, which wasn't uncommon, it being an airbase, but these sounded weird, and were heading directly towards my position. Although I'm a crappy photographer, I'm definitely a military buff, and I know a lot more about most weapon systems than the average Infantry marine does. They sounded like Cobras, and I was really surprised when I saw them coming towards me. The forest wasn't really tall, but in the clearing I didn't see them until they were pretty close. It was a definite pair of AH-1W SuperCobras, and they looked like they were flying blacked out, like they do at night for training sometimes, but they were flying really, really close together and they couldn't have been more than thirty or forty feet above tree level, which is suicidal. I've never seen any helicopter drop below 100 feet, and they must have been going almost 200 miles an hour. I have never seen a helicopter go that fast. They whipped past me so fast I hardly had time to see anything. U SMC Bell AH-1W Super Cobra attack helicopter taking off from an amphibious assault ship. Source: http://www.n avy.mil . [ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - The Bell AH-1 SuperCobra is a twin-engine attack helicopter based on the US Army's AH-1 Cobra. The twin Cobra family includes the AH-1J SeaCobra, the AH-1T Improved SeaCobra, and the AH-1W SuperCobra. The AH-1W is the backbone of the United States Marine Corps's attack helicopter fleet, but will be replaced in service by the AH-1Z Viper upgrade in the next decade, 2010 to 2020.] They buzzed me, almost right over the clearing that I was in, so close to the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"ground that I got fucked up by the rotor wash when they passed by. I thought they were doing some weird training, at first, and kind of laughed to myself because the officers flying were probably pretty pissed that they weren't out on libbo, but what struck me strangest of all was that they had a bright white light in between them, so that it almost looked like they had a spotlight strung on wire between them, but when they passed I saw that it was definitely was not a spotlight. It was a perfect sphere or orb, and it was very, very bright. I can't really describe it better than saying that it was a glowing ball of some kind, slightly in front of the engine, and maybe about level with the cockpits. It was the most amazing white color, and it didn't have any of the weird blue tinge that fluorescents give off, and it didn't have any trace of any other color to it. I saw it move directly up and straight up maybe five hundred feet without stopping or slowing. One second, the glowing sphere was between the two Cobras; the next it was moving vertical with out any sort of turn, and it started making amazing, impossible 90-degree turns in the air, which is something I know no sort of aircraft can do at those speeds, which is beyond my ability to guess at, because of the range and the lack of any backdrop. It was just moving really, really fast and erratically. The two helicopters banked hard to the right and started to come around in a circular or oval shape, just like they do when they are going to start a gun run on a ground target, and I thought for a second it might be some sort of aerial target and that it, and maybe me, were about to get strafed or targeted with a missile. But I don't think it was anything like that, because the glowing sphere made a sort of dart or jump at the first helicopter, which immediately popped flares and chaff and began diving and moving erratically, while the other helicopter lined straight up with it. I tried to take some pictures with my Nikon, but I'm sure you can understand that they came out really badly, because I was shooting at really fast moving things pretty far away in bad light with basically a starter kit package, and I made a huge mistake, because when I tried to adjust the shutter speed, I must have turned the flash back on, and when I held down the shutter on continuous, my flash popped several times, which was really bright in the kind of twilight and easily noticed from the air. By the time I took the photos, the helicopters and the light had zipped away from me and I couldn't see them over the trees. I was packing my shit up, because I had no idea what I had just seen and I felt very strongly that I should immediately get the fuck out of there. As I was getting into my car, the helicopters came back, and began to circle around my position, and I basically freaked out. One of the weirdest things about it was that both Cobras were fully loaded up with rocket pods and with what could only have been AIM sidewinder air-to-air missiles, which is a really unusual load out for Cobras, because they're more supposed to be ground attack helicopters. I know they were sidewinders because they looked fucking huge attached under the cobras, and that kind of spiky looking rocket is really recognizable. I turned my cars lights off and drove away as fast as I could, and it only took me a minute or two to realize that I was A) Making shit speed with my lights off and B) that it didn't matter, because Cobra gun ships have at thermals, or at least night vision. I don't know how long they circled me, but I drove as fast as I could and ended up totaling the underside of my car and bending the frame up under my hood so it doesn't fit flush anymore (It's in the shop now, and thank God, no one cared to ask questions.). I drove in the general direction of the highway, and put my car through the ditch between the highway and the forest. A lot of the backwoods trails have outlets to the highway, and I guess I was lucky to get there as fast as I did, which was exactly blind luck. I did not stop driving south until I got to Newport, where I ditched my car in a parking lot. I didn't know if the helicopters were still following me, or if someone else was, because I'm sure the helicopters saw my cameras flash and they were circling my location instead of doing something else or heading back, and they couldn't have had much fuel left after going that fucking fast. I left my car there for a while, and paid cash at a cheap diner where I could sit and watch my car. I continued south several hours later down towards Motorhead City and then back to Camp Lejeune."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"I haven't told anyone what I saw, and I'm still not sure what it was. The only thing I understand is that I do not think its physically possible for something to move like the light ball did, and the pilots were definitely acting really strange. I don't think they normally train to drop flares and chaff, to avoid any sort of missile lock, because I think that's expensive, and I didn't even know that Marine Corps helicopters could carry sidewinder missiles until I saw them mounted on the Cobras.” Also see: Spherical UFOs Filmed by NASA in Space: http://noolmusic.com/videos /spherical_ufos_filmed_by_nasa_in_space.php More Information : F or further reports about glowing spheres, please see other reports below in the Earthfiles Archive: • 08/26/2008 — Update: Earthfiles Viewer Comments About UFOs and 14th Century Black Death • 08/22/2008 — UFOs and 14th Century Black Death • 08/12/2008 — Part 2: Rise of Fourth Reich -Where Is the Nazi “Die Glocke?” • 08/01/2008 — Part 1: Rise of Fourth Reich in America?
