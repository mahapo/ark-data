Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Part 1: \"Alphonso Lorenzo\" - Military Visitor to Another Planet? © 2006 by Linda Moulton Howe September 4 , 2006 Albuquerque, NM - Since the late fall of 2005, there has been internet speculation about an alleged leaker's release of U. S. government information about a classified project called SERPO. The internet buzz also produced a Wikipedia entry which states: \"Project Serpo is a term in ufology circles referring to an alleged exchange program between ultra top secret levels in the government of the United States and aliens from a homeworld called Serpo. In November 2005, an anonymous source claiming to be part of a high level group of people within the US Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), began releasing information allegedly concerning Project Serpo. This released information claims that in July 1947 there were two extraterrestrial disk UFOs that crashed in the state of New Mexico, widely known and referenced as the famous Roswell UFO incident. \"The Project Serpo releases further claim that there was one surviving alien entity, known as EBE, which was an abbreviation for Extraterrestrial Biological Entity. Communication was allegedly established with this surviving EBE, and consequently its home world. The EBE lived for 5 years and died in 1952. Communications continued with the home world, allegedly in the Zeta Reticuli star system, which led to the arrangement of an exchange program taking place between 1965 to 1978, in which 12 American astronauts traveled to Serpo, 8 of whom returned. Project Serpo may also have been known as Project Crystal Knight at the time (1965-1978).\" I first heard there had been an exchange of humans with one or more extraterrestrial biological entities at Holloman AFB on April 25, 1964, while I was working on a television production for Home Box Office entitled: UFOs, The E. T. Factor. The hour special was never completed or broadcast because of U. S. government interference. [ See my first book, An Alien Harvest © 1989 in Earthfiles Shop .] I never heard the word \"Serpo\" until the November 2005 internet release, which struck me as a lot of misinformation mixed with a few facts. Thus, a classic U. S. government intelligence effort to m uddy waters of an actual historic event classified under a policy of denial in the interest of national security. Further, contaminated Serpo release would allow insiders to monitor who contributes information to the unfolding Serpo saga. The penalty for violating signed oaths of secrecy in the U. S. military and government intelligence can be stiff fines and imprisonment. It's also possible that the Serpo material planted on the internet since November 2005 was officially approved by a need-to-know authority who wanted to test the public waters. Either way, mixing a lot of fiction with a few facts is standard operating procedure in such calculated intelligence efforts. The Serpo details on the internet were different from what I had been told in general outline in the early 1980s and later given more details in 1991 by the late Richard Neal, M. D., a specialist in obstetrics and gynecology at the Beach Medical Center in Lawndale, California. Dr. Neal was a gynecologist who began investigating disappearing pregnancies in women who also described being taken by non-humans aboard craft for gynecological procedures. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"He presented his collected data in a presentation entitled \"The Missing Embryo/Fetus Syndrome\" at the 1992 Mutual UFO Network Symposium in Albuquerque, New Mexico. While I was working in 1991 as Supervising Producer and Concept Creator on a Paramount/Fox-TV special entitled, UFO Report: Sightings , I met with Dr. Neal in Los Angeles. He had handwritten notes from an off-the-record discussion he had with a U. S. intelligence operative a bout an early 1960s human and extraterrestrial biological entity exchange at Holloman AFB, or from not far away at the Trinity Site in the northern panhandle of White Sands Missile Range. Exchange destination: a planet in a solar system revolving around one of the two binary stars of Zeta Reticuli I and II, 39.41 light-years from Earth. Our Sun is classified a yellow G2 V Spectral Type and so is Zeta Reticuli II. Zeta Reticuli I is a G 3/5 V Spectral Type.

Dr. Neal and I had previously discussed information I had written in my first book, An Alien Harvest © 1989, about a landing of an egg-shaped craft at Holloman AFB on April 25, 1964, and an exchange of physical artifacts which I had discussed with Robert Emenegger at his Los Angeles home in spring 1983. [ My notes from that 1983 discussion are included in the page scans below from An Alien Harvest .] Bob Emenegger had been the writer of a television program entitled, UFOs: Past Present and Future . Its first American broadcast was in 1974. Bob had been exposed to discussions about 16mm film that documented a UFO landing at Holloman AFB, which he and the TV producer, Allan Sandler, were supposed to receive for inclusion in their television program. Authorities in the Pentagon yanked the allegedly unique historic film from Emenegger and Sandler right before their final editing and broadcast deadlines. "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"I first came to talk with Bob Emenegger because of a radio interview he had done on Houston, Texas, radio station KTRH, Thanksgiving Day 1976, about a UFO landing at Holloman AFB in the presence of an \"Alphonso Lorenzo.\" During my research for the Home Box Office special in 1983, researcher Tom Adams in Paris, Texas, had heard about the radio interview. I was able to obtain a copy and tracked Bob Emenegger down to discuss it in more detail. [ Part 2 of this report has the relevant radio transcript excerpt about Alphonso Lorenzo.] By then, in many off-the-record conversations trying to find substantive ground on which to proceed with the HBO documentary, I was told that Steven Spielberg's November 16, 1977, release of his now classic feature f ilm, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, was based on some historic fact. I was told that Holloman AFB was the scene of a UFO landing and meeting that included exchange of artifacts and one or more humans entering an extraterrestrial spacecraft for a trip to an EBEN planet in the binary star system, Zeta Reticuli I and II. See 120705Earthfiles. In 1991, Dr. Neal wanted me to know that not only did he have a discussion with an inside source which confirmed the human/E. T. exchange, Dr. Neal said he had been told that three men went to an EBEN planet in the Zeta Reticuli system. One man, he said, had died there, one had gone insane (fate unknown) and one had been returned to Earth and placed in a U. S. government safe house on an island to live out the rest of his days without the public or media ever knowing. Dr. Neal understood that the survivor was referred to as \"Alphonso Lorenzo,\" also known as Gu illermo Mendoza. Beginning on Aug 29, 2006, at 2:17 PM, Bren Burton of the internet forum, Open Minds, wrote to me: \" Dear colleague, I realise that you are very busy, but maybe you could shed some light on something for me. I run a forum (Open Minds) which is debating the 'Serpo' phenomena. www.OpenMinds.co.nr If you are not aware of the story - it relates to some of the disclosures which, I believe, you were introduced to some years ago, regarding a supposed alien exchange prog. Would you be kind enough to let me know your thoughts about the 'serpo' disclosures and give your permission to have those thoughts published on our forum? I would be more than happy to provide a direct link to your 'earthfiles' web site. Either way, thanks again for your time, and for any insight you may be able offer. Best wishes, Bren Burton.\" That afternoon, I replied: \" Thanks for contacting me. I learned back in the 1983-1984 time period about an alleged exchange program of humans leaving Holloman AFB on April 25, 1964, for Zeta Reticuli with non-humans while I was working on a Home Box Office television special entitled, \" UFOs: The E. T. Factor.\" I was told three human men went: one died on the alien planet; one went insane (don't know fate); and one returned to Earth and was given a safe house in which to live the rest of his life on an island provided for by the U. S. government. \" For more details, please see my books available at http://www.earthfiles.com /shop.cfm 1) An Alien Harvest 2) Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. I: Facts & Eyewitnesses 3) Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. II: High Strangeness"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"There is also relevant information in the extensive Archives of my news website, http://www.earthfiles.com.\" That same day, Brendon wrote back: \" Thanks for the response. I'm going to push my luck here (!), but could you elaborate on how you came by that information?\" He also inquired about Bill Ryan at the Project Serpo website doing an interview with me.\" The next day on August 30, 2006, since I had been on the record from 1989 through the 1990s concerning what I had learned about an alleged Holloman landing and exchange in my 1989 book, An Alien Harvest, and my 2-volume books (1994 and 1998), Glimpses of Other Realities , I replied: \" My main source was Robert Emenegger, the writer of UFOs: Past, Present and Future, which was broadcast in the U. S. on television in the late 1970s. I think it would be of great value to you all if you would read my 2-volume book, Glimpses of Other Realities, in which I discuss Emenegger and much, much more. After you and your colleagues have absorbed those two books, then I would be happy to do an interview.\" On August 30, I also received a follow up inquiry from Brian Parks, Torrance, California, about Brendan's Serpo inquiries: \" Beside Bob Emmenegger, was your other source James McCampbell?\" On August 31, 2006, I replied: \" I am not commenting on SERPO. I know nothing about SERPO as an acronym or program. \" I am only relating what I was told back in the early 1980s about a human exchange. My information about an exchange did not come from James McCampbell.\" What I left out was my 1991 conversation in Los Angeles with the deceased Richard Neal, M. D., about his handwritten notes described above. Later that day, this exchange was posted by Victor Martinez (ongoing, large email list about SERPO), leaving out my clarification that I was not addressing SERPO which I know nothing about: Brendan Burton (Admin of the Open Minds forum) asked Linda Howe personally about \" Project SERPO\" : LINDA REPLIED: \" I learned back in the 1983-1984 time period about an alleged exchange program of humans leaving Holloman AFB on April 25, 1964, for Zeta Reticuli with non-humans while I was working on a Home Box Office television special entitled, \"UFOs: The E.

He lived in Houston and had access to NASA but did not work for NASA.\" BILL RYAN: This is potentially very important ... it starts to look like a trip to Reticulum 4 DID occur. \" I've also received two messages from a claimed intel source in the last 24 hours who said that several important details were just plain wrong, and suggested that either I'd got lucky and guessed uncannily accurately (in the event that I'd made it up), or that I'd been deliberately disinformed. He said no more because he told me I was heavily monitored. This person appears only to have just now come across the Serpo story on the Web. The game may have changed now. Let's forget the details of the story, how many went, what the dates were, even the alien culture and whether GMRRF exists or not (I'm sure it doesn't). Only one question is really important. Was there an exchange program? I suggest that the answer is that there WAS. The circumstantial evidence mounts, and the \" Project SERPO\" story on the Web site starts to look like disinfo which surrounds and protects the details of an incredibly true event. Another important question is what other untold truths the disinfo may be designed to conceal. All views welcome, and do copy to others if you wish. Best to all, – BILL RYAN\" The next day on September 1, Hal Puthoff, Ph. D., Director of the Institute for Advanced Studies at Austin, in Austin, Texas, and a pioneer in the search for zero point energy, wrote to Victor Martinez the following email after forwarding my comment to Bob Emenegger and asking if my comment was true: \" On Sep 1, 2006, at 10:36 AM, Puthoff@aol.com wrote: Victor, I checked with Bob Emenegger concerning the statement circulating that he verified an exchange program. Here's his answer: \" The truth is I was briefed on three aliens, looking similar to us, only short, blue grey skin - met with Holloman AF personnel -Alfonso Lorenzo acted as a host/handler (medical tech) - He alerted Paul Shartle at Norton (AFB in California) about the incident and film of the event. (We found Lorenzo in base records and a CI agent checked on him.) I NEVER mentioned AF personnel going off with aliens to Zeta Reticuli or one alien dying or going insane! \" Hal \" Later that same September 1, 2006, afternoon, Hal Puthoff wrote to Robert Emenegger, beginning \"Just for my eyes only.\" However, the email somehow got onto Victor Martinez's email distribution list which reached me. September 1, 2006, e -mail from Hal Puthoff to Robert Emenegger: \" Just for my eyes only, do you believe the briefing? Pretty dramatic claim. Official contact with aliens on a military base, for God's sakes! (I know you had no choice but to use it in the book and video, of course, *****it was your day job to put out what they told you.) Did you ever, e.g., check with Coleman to determine whether he would provide independent verification that the"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"claimed meeting was actually true?\" Bob Emenegger replied: \" A: Hal, I believe the briefing because Shartle had correspondence and audio cassette tape from Lorenzo. I saw a document from Holloman with his name on it. I read, at Norton, where it landed, the date, specifics who was involved, which building they were taken to ; where the craft was stored (end of Mars Ave) and about signals they were asked to ID. At Holloman everything was there as outlined. Col Lane/Shartle's military boss and OSI (at Norton) knew what Shartle was doing. Col Weinbrenner (Commander Foreign Tech) didn't blink when I mentioned it. \" When showing our program at ASTARA in Upland Calif. [ former Project Blue Book spokesman, [USAF Col William T.] Coleman was with me (he was producing that NBC show \" Blue Book\" with Jack Webb in LA ) - a woman stood up telling us her son was at that base and how they were ordered to stay inside their quarters. The head radar man at Holloman made reference to \" the day that 'flying bathtub' landed\" . No one at the Pentagon questioned the incident (but also didn't comment one way or another - except to add \" ...an event that may happen in the future... or perhaps has already happened\" I didn't take any liberties. The Pentagon had a legal agreement with final approval on all we presented Yes, this is a remarkable event - If at the time I knew more. I may have done more. But I was totally new to UFO stuff. - you can share this if you want. ***** I did not get any outline or direction from them and created the film with facts as we found them.
