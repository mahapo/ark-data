It was a new technology that no one understood. The American insiders, the MJ-12 group, were not going to mention its existence to anyone.\" - J. Andrew Kissner R eturn to Part 1 \"Secret War?\" The Plane Carnage Continues O n the Fourth of July 1947, while Mac Brazel was visiting the Roswell Sheriff to tell him about the crash of a flying saucer on his ranch near Corona, a B-17 bomber crashed in Sibley, Louisiana, w ithin one mile of the runway. A public affairs officer at Barkesfield Field in Shreveport announced that it had crashed because \"a staff sergeant had taken the plane on an unauthorized flight.\" Little is known about this event because the only report found concerning the crash, explosion and fire was an Associated Press wire photo in a local newspaper in New Mexico. [ Las Cruces Sun-News , July 6, 1945.] Thirty miles south of Tucson, Arizona, a pilot and his passenger were killed as their plane took off from a landing strip on their ranch the Fourth of July. Eyewitness observers reported that as the plane took off, it lost power and crashed at the end of the runway. \"The ...light plane plunged into the ground from a height of several hundred feet shortly after taking off...\" The pilot was a B-29 navigator in WWII and a flying instructor at a pilot training school in Tucson. [ Front Page, Las Cruces Sun-News , July 5, 1947.] F ront P age, Las Cruces Sun-News, July 5, 1947. On July 8, The New York Times Military Affairs Editor, Hanson Baldwin, wrote yet another story about the need to re-survey the American air defense capability. \"The Air Coordinating Committee, which last made an estimate of national needs in 1945, will report to the President that a minimum of 3,000 to 5,000 military aircraft per year will be necessary to assure our nation's security. Stanford Research Institute (SRI) will conduct a "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"detailed study of national requirements. ...In addition to Stanford, the committee will draw upon the Air Material Command of the Army Air Forces and the Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics for information and plans evolved in those quarters before drafting its report.\" That same day above New York City and eastern Canada, eight flying discs were reported. Police were inundated with phone calls as were astronomers. In the story, a professor in Australia discussed an experiment that he conducted with his students. He had 450 of them stare at a fixed point in the sky. Twenty-two came back ten minutes later to ay they had seen a flying disc. \"Just as I thought,\" said the professor. It was all due to the red corpuscles of blood passing in front of the retina of the eye.\" [ Ibid.] On July 9, an Army Air Forces C-54 transport on a flight from Bermuda to Florida simply \"disappeared,\" according to the Air Transport Command. Its crew of six was presumed lost at sea. A search and rescue effort was launched and two cushions were found with an oxygen bottle and some aircraft plywood before the search was called off. [ The New York Times , July 9, 1947, p. 47.] On July 11, another V-2 was launched at WSPG. This test was terminated 35 seconds into the flight. The Las Cruces Sun-News reported that after the missile had soared eighteen miles, the rocket was \"brought down by a newly installed safety station after it became evident that the missile, while on a northerly course, would go north out of the safety range. The missile was in the air seventy seconds ... and landed two miles from the launch site and the remaining fuel exploded. Col. Turner said the test firing was an excellent demonstration of the effectiveness of the new safety devices.\" [Author's emphasis.] Only one month before, Col. Turner told reporters that V-2 rocket fuel does not explode, \"it burns.\" But after the July 11 aborted launch, Col. Turner explained that the remaining fuel in that V-2 exploded on impact with the ground. On July 12, the wife and daughter of a New Jersey businessman were killed when their seaplane crashed as it attempted to land at Lake George, New York. The pilot was critically injured. Another seaplane, circling to see what had happened to the first plane, also crashed as its wingtip brushed the water while it was banking in a turn. The pilot of the second plane suffered minor injuries. [ The New York Times , July 13, 1947, p. 47.] On July 13, twenty-one people were killed and fifteen injured when a DC-3 crashed into a swamp in Florida. The plane on a flight from Newark, New Jersey to Miami, crashed a mile short of an emergency runway in Broward County. A passenger on board the place said that one engine stopped and then a second engine stopped and the aircraft crashed. Also on July 13, an American Airlines CD-4 en route to Shannon Airport, Ireland, landed in Newfoundland after two of its four engines \"went dead\" over the Atlantic Ocean. The commercial airliner had been rented by a Long Beach, California firm. [ The New York Times , July 14, 1947, p. 2.] That same day, a Navy Corsair fighter flying from the Naval Air Station at Willow Grove, Pennsylvania, crashed and exploded at Harbourton, New Jersey, in the cemetery of a Presbyterian church. The pilot died. He was apparently seeking a landing in the rural and isolated area when he struck a tree that knocked him into utility poles on both sides of a road that sheared off both the plane's wings. \"Debris was scattered around the headstones by the blast that followed.\" [ Ibid.] On July 14, Harold Duke of Hot Springs, Arkansas put his burning twin engine airplane down on an abandoned airstrip near Albuquerque just as the fire \"was reaching the control panel.\" [ Front Page, Las Cruces Sun-News , July 16, 1947.] That same day, two U. S. AAF aircraft collided in mid-air near Frankfurt, Germany. This accident is unreported in any U. S. media with the exception of an obituary notice in a Wilson, Texas, newspaper, the hometown of one of the dead pilots. On July 15, a Las Cruces family and their friend watched a comet-like object from their front yards: \"...while seated in their front yard, they saw a large light in the sky. The object appeared larger than an automobile headlight and was traveling at a terrific rate of speed and left a trail like a comet. The object was going north and was almost directly between the Organ Mountains and Las Cruces when discovered. It burst into three pieces and immediately searchlights went up from the White Sands Proving Grounds and searched the skies for an indefinite length of time.\" [ Front Page, Las Cruces Citizen , July 17, 1947.] Off the coast of Melbourne, Australia, eight members of the British Royal Navy were killed on July 20, in a series of airplane accidents over one hour. Two Fireflies from the British aircraft carrier Theseus interlocked in the air and dropped 1,000 feet into Port Phillip Bay, killing six and injuring one. A Seafire aircraft then attempted a landing on the deck of the Theseus and struck and fatally injured a seaman. A second Seafire then attempted a landing, bounced over the crash barriers and ran into two parked aircraft killing one mechanic and injuring another. [ The New York Times , July 21, 1947.] On July 21, an Argentine transport plane ran into a crowd killing seventeen when it could not stop on the runway. After running into the crowd, the airplane burst into flames. [ The New York Times , July 22, 1947, p. 10.]"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"F ront P age, El Paso Times , July 22, 1947. Also on July 21, two U. S. Marine Corps aircraft interlocked in mid-air above El Toro Air Field, California, and crashed. Two pilots bailed out, but the third was killed. Eyewitnesses said the tails of t he two planes appeared to lock together. [ Ibid.] T he New York Times, July 22, 1947, p. 25. The same day, two 5th Air Force pilots were killed when their planes collided in the air two miles east of Tokyo. One pilot had flown more than eighty missions in Europe in WWII, while the other pilot had flown over fifty. [ Ibid.]"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"T he New York Times, July 22, 1947, p. 45. On July 23, five Navy fliers were killed when their PB4Y crashed two and a half miles short of the end of the runway at Whidby Island, Washington, while on final approach. As the aircraft hit the ground, it burst into flames. No explanation for the crash was offered.

While Planes Crashed, Flying Discs Were Everywhere On July 5, Civil Aeronautics officials in Augusta, Maine, saw dozens of \"flying missiles\" over the city traveling in a northerly direction. In a new s article about the sighting, a spokesman for General Electric said that it had been successful in \"growing large ice crystals\" which if viewed at a distance, in just the right light, might resemble a flying disc. [ The New York Times , July 6, 1947, p. 36.]"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" On July 7, a group of ten people watched a flight of eight flying discs near St. Maries, Idaho. One of the female eyewitnesses told the El Paso Times on July 7, 1947, \"The discs came into view at an extreme speed, going in a northerl y di recti on, suddenl y sl ow ed and fl uttered l ike l eaves to the ground. She sai d that they w ere as l arge as a five room house and were extremely bright. She said that she and her companions could not find them afterward, nor any sign that they had been there.\" In the same El Paso Times report, a professor of psychiatry at Syracuse University College of Medicine said in a radio interview, \"the discs possibly were a result of experiments by unknown government agencies. The element of mass hysteria should not be taken into consideration. They have been seen by too many people in too many different places to be dismissed so lightly.\" On July 6, the Army Air Forces reported that they would like to see a flying disc. A more interesting aspect of this report quotes a nuclear physicist at the California Institute of Technology (CIT) as saying, \"They (flying discs) have nothing to do with nuclear physics.\" CIT became a member of the JRDB, UARRP on the recommendation of Holger Toftoy about six months prior to the physicists's statement. CIT was also the principal contractor for the Hermes project that was trying out surface-to-air missiles at White Sands. General Electric was a subcontractor to CIT. Civil Aeronautics Board Airplane Fatalities January through June 1947 On July 24, the Civil Aeronautics Board released its fatality figures for the first six months of 1947. Domestically, the CAB reported a total of 167 people killed between January 1 and June 30, 1947. This was the highest number since statistics began being collected in 1939; the fatality rate was three times higher than the year before. And yet, that record-breaking official CAB total does not seem to include all the fatalities listed in the newspapers I researched for the period. There was a real threat to the national security of the United States in the summer of 1947, but few Americans were aware that it was not the U.S.S.R. It was not China. It was not the Koreans. The threat was the new disc technology with weapons that were more capable than anything on earth. It was a new technology that no one understood. The American insiders, the MJ-12 group, were not going to mention its existence to anyone. T he New York Times , July 24, 1947, p. 9. C ontinued in Part 19 - American Attacks and Disc Retaliations?
