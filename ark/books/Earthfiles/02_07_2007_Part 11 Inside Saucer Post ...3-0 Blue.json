Ruppelt, F ormer Head of USAF Project Blue Book Return to Part 1 February 7, 2007 Albuquerque, New Mexico - A n official publication of Civilian Research, Interplanetary Flying Objects (CRIFO) © 1957 by Leonard H. Stringfield. BALANCING THE EVIDENCE Lumping all the heterogeneous loose ends o the so-called evidence together, one logically asks, Where does it all fit? Look magazine, in an Air Force-approved article entitled \"Hunt For the Flying Saucer,\" printed in June 1952, said: \"Air Force officials feel the final solution to the flying saucer mystery will be found under one or more of the following headings: 1) misinterpretations of known objects 2) ... phenomena of nature or optics 3) ... man-made developments and 4) ... interplanetary spaceships or missiles. But in the same breath, the Air Force-approved article squashed item one, admitting \"even the most cautious Air Force authorities feel certain that many people are not describing the behavior of any conventional form of aircraft, not even an aircraft on the most experimental drawing boards.\" Under item two, Captain Ruppelt, then head of Project Blue Book, was quoted as saying: \"If saucers turn out to be natural phenomena, we will drop out and hand the problem over to scientists. But if they turn out to be 'hostile vehicles,' we will keep after them.\" (And for the record, the USAF is still chasing \"hostile vehicles.\") Under item three, the articles quote Ruppelt as saying, \"If these are man-made, whoever is making them is way ahead of us technologically.\" Item three also says, \"...although this is constantly denied, they might be a part of a secret U. S. development project.\" Then it quotes an intelligence officer as saying: \"I'm quite sure there is no secret project. There is more chance that they are from Mars...\" Under item four, the article "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"states, \"Air Force intelligence men say they are continually astounded by the number of trained scientists who believe they are interplanetary in origin.\" The article ends with this statement by Ruppelt, \"...They have been around for five years (now ten years) and haven't struck yet. But that doesn't mean they are not a potential threat.\" Outside the Air Force, the best brains in saucer research generally agree that saucers are a controlled machine. Beyond this accord, however, feelings run rampant. Two major camps exist, one who sees all the evidence as interplanetary; the other, as belonging down to earth. The best argument for earth-made saucers comes from the writings of James Moseley, Editor of Saucer News , formerly Nexus , and Dr. Leon Davidson, a frequent contributor to this magazine. I first became acquainted with Moseley by letter, which was dated February 23, 1954. An excerpt from his correspondence to me: \"My reason for writing you is that I am in receipt of information that leads me to believe that you are quite interested in 'flying saucers,' as I am, and that you have a good deal of information on this subject.\" In answering Moseley, I asked how he learned of my name and my interest in saucers. His next letter, written on \"Gran Hotel Bolivar\" stationery from Lima, Peru, replied: \"...I spent several days at the Press Desk at the Pentagon. During that time, I became quite friendly with one of the lieutenants there. In the course of a general 'bull session' on saucers, he started reading questions off a sheet he had. I did not know at first what sort of document it was, but eventually told me that it was a series of questions someone had sent in, and he gave me your name and address. He said that whoever sent those questions apparently had made quite a study of saucers and that I might be interested in corresponding with him.\" After several months of exchanging information by correspondence, Moseley visited my home in July 1954, en route to Columbus, Ohio, where he said he was to check into a \"lead from a woman who worked with the Army there, and who says that a captured saucer went through her base on its way to Wright-Patterson.\" During our chat, Moseley told me he felt 90% sure that saucers were interplanetary. Shortly after his visit, Moseley startled everyone in research by announcing in the October 1954 issue of Nexus that he had come across \"irrefutable documented evidence\" that saucers were secret U. S. weapons. He also announced that this \"evidence\" would be divulged in his next issue of Nexus . Knowing that he in the meantime made acquaintance with Dr. Leon Davidson, I began to wonder what the two had discussed beyond what Davidson had mentioned in his correspondence with me. But a letter from Moseley, dated November 5, 1954, provided at least a partial answer: \"If you have gotten Nexus No. 5 by now, you already know that I can't come out with my 'irrefutable evidence' after all. It had nothing to do with Davidson's information, however, although he is very logical and convincing. ...As for the other material, I won't be able to use it. I have learned the hard way that the 'U. S. Weapon' theory is a dangerous one to deal with. As long as you continue to push Space, I think yo will be all right with your newsletter.\" Because of Moseley's big switch, many researchers have come to look upon him as a sort of jester in the business. While I cannot see Moseley as a jester, remembering some of his more constructive work in exposing several flaws in the \"contact\" stories, other researchers have taken him to task. It was Moseley who opened the scabs from the sores of his earlier promises by publishing, minus his \"irrefutable evidence,\" certain high points of his theory in his June to July 1956 issue of Saucer News. For convenience here, I quote from Lex Mebane's summary of the Moseley text, which he critically reviewed in CSI's June 1956 News-Letter, as follows: Lex Mebane, 1956: \"Unknown to the public, radioactive contamination of the earth's atmosphere has reached a very dangerous level because not only bombs, but also secret non-bomb tests which 'got decidedly out of hand' have been contributing to it. However, there is not only secret contamination, but also secret decontamination going on. This is done by what we know as flying saucers. The type of saucer involved is manufactured and flown from a super- secret underground base in the Southwest and is sent out all over the world to mop up atmospheric radiation. \"It is powered by an atomic engine, which converts atomic energy directly to electricity (a secret discovery) and uses this electricity in some manner to produce 'an entirely new and previously unknown type of propulsion.' There is a special branch of the government that carries out these operations; its existence is known to very few. Project Blue Book's investigators knew nothing of it and never discovered the truth. The radiation 'absorbed' by the saucers is converted to electrical energy and released to the air, 'overloading it with electricity,' which accounts for various abnormal weather conditions of"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"recent years. These 'mops' are remotely controlled. They are capable of the silent, super-fast flight in the atmosphere so characteristic of flying saucers: they reduce air friction to a small fraction of the normal by simply ionizing the air in front of them. 'I have proof,' Moseley declares, 'but it is of such a nature that I do not feel it advisable to identify it here.'\" Mebane then comments: \"...the story as it stands bears the marks of psuedo-science\" and in his review he lists seven valid reasons in support of his argument. Curious, and desiring an official view on the Moseley revelations, I wrote to the Atomic Energy Commission in June 1956, but my letter was ignored.\" Others befriending Moseley for years began suspecting him as an Air Force agent. Gray Barker, in his May 1957 issue of the Saucerian Bulletin , called Moseley \"violently anti-saucer and evidently a believer in the almost ridiculous theory that saucers are made by the government.\" In the same bulletin, Barker also aired an anonymous letter, which was sent originally to Cosmic News , a discontinued saucerzine published in Strongsville, Ohio. The letter said in part: \"...In my research, I learned that Mr. Moseley is in reality a reserve First Lieutenant in the U. S. Air Force. From 1950 to 1953, he was working in Intelligence in connection with some highly secret work the CIA was doing in Germany. Since 1953, he has held the position of a liaison officer with Air Technical Intelligence Center (ATIC), Wright-Patterson AFB in Dayton, Ohio, which as you must know has been connected with the Air Force's investigation of the UFO problem. I first met Mr. Moseley here in Miami in1955, at a private meeting of the Southern Aeronautical Association. Since then, I have had the opportunity to meet him three more times at aeronautical and military conferences here in Miami and elsewhere. \"Due to my personal interest in the UFO problem, I have for several years subscribed to the various amateur UFO publications, such as yours. I can tell you that it came as quite a shock to me when I first learned that Moseley was publishing a UFO journal. The shock was all the greater when I saw his journal and learned the type of erroneous material he wa trying to mislead the public with. I can tell you with absolute certainty that should Moseley wish to do so, he would be in possibly the best position of anyone in the United States to expose the true nature of the UFO mystery. The reason he does not do so should be clear from all I have said so far. In short, Mr. Moseley is nothing more or less than a paid tool of the U. S. Air Force.\" Timely and pertinent is an article in the August 1957 issue of UFO News-Letter edited by Lee Munsick, entitled \"Unsensational, Not Confidential.\" It goes into detail on the Moseley-Barker feud. Says Munsick, \"Obviously the Cosmic News letter is bunk. ...The military business about Moseley might be prompted by the fact that a relative was an officer of fairly high rank in another service. As far as being a paid stooge for the Air Force, it's fairly well known that Mr. Moseley need not rely on the Pentagon for his daily meals. The USAF informs us there is no Lieut. James W. Moseley. Neither of two AF James Moseleys with other initials live anywhere near New Jersey.\" In the June-July issue of Saucer News , Moseley also denies the charge of being an AF agent, calling Cosmic News ' anonymous letter a \"fantastic hoax.\" In this same issue, however, Moseley continues the \"U. S. Weapons\" hue and cry, publishing Part Two of \"The Air Force and the Saucers,\" in which Dr. Leon Davidson speculates on the \"Psychological Warfare Applications of Flying Saucers\" and the secret U. S. agency who runs its operations. Said Davidson, \"The true solution, if saucers were indeed real interplanetary spaceships, would certainly have been found in the past ten years of study. It can be taken for granted that if the Air Force had been in doubt of the true nature of saucers since 1949, it would unquestionably hav asked the National Academy of Science to conduct a full scientific study of the subject, using the nation's leading scientists and scientific organizations...\" Contrary to Davidson's contention that leading U. S. scientists have not been summoned to study UFOs, I was told on two occasions by Capt. Gregory of Section 4E4 of ATIC (a section which studies UFO phenomena) that in its employment were \"many leading U. S. scientists.\" He also said, \"If they can't find the answers, we go to scientists overseas for evaluations.\" For years, the Air Force, through its spokesman and in letters, has said that the UFO research section of ATIC was small or \"undermanned\" with hints that the Ruppelts, Hardins and Gregorys, who were reportedly in charge of its operation, were \"practically working alone.\" But if Gregory's disclosures are true, scientists are as hard at work now as"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"they were when Colonel O'Mara told me in 1954 that the Air Force had \"over a thousand of the nation's leading scientists\" working on the UFO project. Major Keyhoe also told me long ago he believed that Ruppelt and Hardin, as in the case of Gregory at this writing, were sitting in front of a big operation. Assuming that Capt. Edward J. Ruppelt was in the know about \"inside\" ATIC affairs before he left Project Blue Book in 1953, his letter to me dated February 21, 1955, is then significant. It said in part, \"As for their (UFOs) being a U. S., or any worldly development, I can categorically deny this.\" [ Editor's Note: The Report On Unidentified Flying Objects © 1956 by Edward J. Ruppelt, Former Head of the U.S. Air Force Project Blue Book.] B ack flap: \"Here is the first serious, unbiased account of the United States Air Force investigation of these mysterious objects in the sky, written by the man who was head of Project Blue Book\" (from 1951 to 1953), © 1956 by Edward J. Ruppelt. Another letter of significance, dated February 16, 1955, from Capt. White of OPI, USAF Defense Department, said: \"...We have been experimenting with new type aircraft and missiles for a long time. Possibly some of them have been reported as unidentified flying objects. However, the number of such sightings would be negligible. We have nothing which spins through the air like a disc, pulsates, glows, dematerializes, changes colors, goes from a mid-air standstill to a supersonic speed, or that can turn at square angles in full flight, as some sighters report.\" According to the Davidson camp of theoreticians, White's letter is essentially true, but the catch phrase in it is the word, \"We\" in the sentence which reads: \"We have nothing which spins through the air like a disc, etc.\" This \"We,\" according to Davidsonian perspicacity, refers only to the Air Force and does not necessarily include a saucer development by the Navy. Davidson's argument in part appeared in the June-July issue of Saucer News: \"...In 1947, the production prototype of the Navy's circular prop-driven flying wing, the Chance-Vought XF5U-1 'Flying Flapjack,' was just due for test flights at Muroc, California. (See Janes' All the World's Aircraft , 1947 and 1948 editions.) This airplane is described in an N. A. C. A. report issued June 7, 1949, Report RML9C29, where it is called a 'convertible-type airplane,' which was 'expected to assume attitudes approaching hovering and vertical descent...' There is no public record that the test flight at Muroc were either held or called off. However, LCDR Pickett Lumpkin, USN, informed me in 1952, that 'it became apparent that the desired speed characteristics could be attained with less difficulty in a jet-powered aircraft,' and LCDR F. M. Lloyd USN informed me in 1952 that 'the XF5U was officially dropped on March 12, 1948.' \"All that can be fairly concluded from the above is that the U. S. Navy, about 1947, was trying to get a flying wing aircraft which could hover as well as fly at high speeds. By coincidence, just at the time that the XF5U-1 was scheduled for test flights at Muroc, there came the first (and I mean the very first ) flying saucer sightings which entered the Air Force files. \"In the Project Grudge report of August 1949, cases 1, 2, 3, and 4 are listed for July 7 and 8, 1947, at Muroc and Rogers Dry Lake, California (now called Edwards Air Force Base). These first reports were made by Air Force personnel and refer to an oscillating object which flew slowly and had tactics unlike an ordinary airplane. There were two fins on the upper surface (the XF5U had these also) which crossed at intervals, suggesting a slow oscillation."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Some observers at that time at Muroc reported seeing two discs at about 8,000 feet altitude, maneuvering in tight circles with varying speeds and oscillating.\" So I wrote to the Navy for a statement. Their reply, dated July 24, 1957, and signed by P. G. Conwell, LCDR. USN, Technical Information Officer, follows: \"Since its organization in 1946, the Office of Naval Research has engaged in an extensive program of upper atmosphere research. Among the tools used to obtain information are plastic SKYHOOK balloons. Some reports of unidentified flying objects have subsequently proved to be these SKYHOOK balloon floatings at high altitude. This might account for the rumors you have heard that the Navy is developing a device similar to a 'flying saucer.'\" While the Navy (not very forcefully) scuttles its hypothetical \"flying saucer,\" calling such a development \"rumors,\" the most significant letter in my collection which should erase the United States weapon theory was received from General Saturnino G. Armenanzas, Air Attache of the Argentine government. Attached to this letter, dated May 9, 1955, were two pages in Spanish which describe a better-than-average UFO sighting over Cordoba Airport in Argentina on November 25, 1954. C opy of Argenti ne letter sent to CRIFO, w hi ch suggests i nternati onal i nterest in the UFO puzzle. Attached to this letter was a report of a UFO seen over Cordoba Airport in 1954. For the U. S. Navy, or any other agency, to flaunt a secret weapon over Argentina, especially when relations with the Peron regime were already strained, would not be in accord with U. S. policy. Just as inconceivable is the notion that a U. S. secret weapon would be used to spy on Argentina. Here, logically, our first question would be, \"Spy on what?\" and \"What could an aerial weapon uncover in Argentina that any old-fashioned two-legged spy would not?\" But the best answer against such an adventure would be the risk of the saucer's power failure. Not only would the U. S. lose its biggest secret, but the ignominious dud would bring tremendous reverberations in foreign capitols. In short order, Argentina would have called the U. S. an aggressor - and they would have been justified. Perhaps a better argument against the U. S. weapons theory lies in the mildewed testimony of the old sightings. As Major Keyhoe once pointed out, many are undoubtedly \"old wives tales,\" but others on record seem on face value to be just as credible as those reported today. On the other hand, Dr. Donald Menzel has tried to lump them all into the waste basket of optical or natural phenomena. But again, certain cases, which describe low-flying metallic objects, are not so lumpable. Perhaps the best reference to historical UFO data is in the works of Charles Fort. But researchers are constantly uncovering new \"old\" reports. I found one while taking a break reading galley proofs of this book. My source was John Evelyn's Diary, Vol. I, page 43, in"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"which the author describes a UFO seen March 10, 1643. Better testimony, however, are the firsthand reports dating back to the turn of the century to and including World War II. Typical of one of these is a report I received, which described a \"flying horseshoe\" seen over Newfoundland in 1922. Another was of a silver ball seen over the same area in 1943 during wartime construction work. Still more interesting is an account sent by Charles Paisley of Atlanta, Georgia. The place was West Point, Mississippi, and the time was \"early 1900s.\" \"As was customary for Mississippi summer months, the day was one of hot drowsiness. Through a cloudless, haze-free sky, the early afternoon sun shone down almost undisturbed by wind. My father, C. W. Paisley, Sr., then in his early teens, was alone in the back yard of his family's home, which was situated on the outskirts of town. Walking toward the house, he noticed an unusual whirring noise in the easterly sky. Idly glancing up in that direction, he was astounded to see a small, darkish bob hurtling through the air with the whirring sound that had attracted his attention. The unknown object shot by not far overhead of my incredulous father at a speed rivaling that of a modern jet. It continued on in a perfectly straight and horizontal line of flight until lost from view in the indistinct green of a far distant clump of trees. \"The UFO - as it would undoubtedly be termed nowadays - had been in plain view over level countryside long enough for my father to note the following details: \"Its color was uniform, the blackish-grey of slate; especially when at close proximity. The object was clearly defined against the bright sky, presenting an unmistakable disc to the naked eye; the solidity of the object could not be doubted. \"It did not occur to my father at the time to make any estimates as to apparent size compared with known objects, speed, etc., so the following estimates made over 50 years later are understandably indefinite: the object's size approximated a baseball held at arm's length; speed 200 to 300 mph; altitude 1500 feet. \"My father admits that a sighting made so long ago can hardly be regarded as conclusive evidence for the UFO, but he stoutly maintains that he saw what he saw and that the object was neither a plane, balloon nor optical phenomenon. But he stops there. He is certain about what he did not see - and that's all.\" My favorite was the \"flap of 1897,\" reported first by Readers Digest in 1952: \"In April 1897, U. S. newspapers from coast to coast gave front page space to a huge, cigar-shaped 'airship' cruising around Chicago. Late in March, dispatches from the West had described a cigar-shaped object, with no motive power, 'certainly not steam,' first reported near Sacramento and then Denver. On March 29, according to the New York Herald , it was seen 'by a majority of the resident of Omaha. It was in the shape of a bright light, too big for a balloon.' The New York Sun stated that Kansas City trolley cars stopped 'and soon the whole population was watching it from the street and rooftops. The light was as big as that produced by 20 stars.' Stories poured into the Chicago Tr ibune. 'Reputable citizens (of Eldora, Iowa) say they observed the gigantic airship. One man said it resembled an immense bird of polished silver.' In Milwaukee, 'thousands of people saw it. The machine floated over the City Hall, where it stopped for a quarter of an hour.'\" In The Case for the UFO , professional astronomer M. K. Jessup has published some excellent material he ferreted out of old astronomical records and notes which reveal \"strange objects\" in space. Another important discovery is a time-worn book from the library of John Kiss of Cincinnati. Published in 1880, the book entitled The Great Events of Our Past Century , relates that during the meteor shower of 1833, the \"whole firmament over all the United States, being for hours in fiery commotion.\" It also calls attention to some \"remarkable\" meteors during that period and tells of one seen from Poland, Ohio, as \"a luminous body distinctly visible in the northeast for more than an hour ... very brilliant in the form of a pruning hook ... gradually settling toward the horizon.\" Another example was, \"At Niagara Falls, a large luminous body shaped like a square table was seen nearly in the zenith, remaining for some time almost stationary and emitting large streams of light.\" Still another: \"At Charleston, S. C., a meteor of extraordinary size was seen to course the heavens for a great length of time and then was heard to explode with the noise of a cannon.\""},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"But for the readers who like drama with their old sightings, I quote from a letter by N. M. Cranmer of Hammersley Fork, Pennsylvania, appearing in the November 1955 issue of Bluebook magazine. \"...On July 6, 1940, a neighbor's hired man saw what looked like an 'aluminum dishpan going up this narrow valley. He grabbed his pet goose and ran in the house and hid. They sent him to the insane asylum for treatment. Two miles farther up the valley, another young man saw it and told his wife. She told him he was crazy, so he took his rifle and blew his head off.\" C ontinued in Part 12: Saucer Sancta - 801 and 4E4 More Information: For further information about Leonard Stringfield's UFO Status Reports, please see reprints below from the Earthfiles Archives: Status Reports I • 10/25/2005 -- Final Part 6: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants in Military Custody • 10/13/2005 -- Part 5: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants in Military Custody • 10/05/2005 -- Part 4: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants in Military Custody • 09/30/2005 -- Part 3: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants in Military Custody • 09/26/2005 -- Part 2: Retrievals of the Third Kind - Kingman, Arizona Crash • 09/25/2005 -- Part 1: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants in Military Custody Status Reports II • 09/19/2005 -- Final Part 9: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data • 09/17/2005 -- Part 8: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data • 09/14/2005 -- Part 7: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data • 09/06/2005 -- Part 6: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data • 08/22/2005 -- Part 5: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data • 08/17/2005 -- Part 4: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data • 07/20/2005 -- Part 3: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data • 07/14/2005 -- Part 2: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data • 07/12/2005 -- Part 1: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data Status Reports III • 07/05/2005 -- Final Part 15: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence • 06/20/2005 -- Part 14: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence • 06/17/2005 -- Part 13: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence • 05/10/2005 -- Part 12: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence • 05/04/2005 -- Part 11: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence • 04/19/2005 -- Part 10: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence © June 1982 by Leonard H.
