Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Strange Stem Anomalies in New Dutch Crop Circles © 2002 by Linda Moulton Howe July 24, 2002 The Netherlands - Robert Boerman of the Dutch Crop Circle Archive called me tonight to report that two more circles have arrived in a Groote Keeten, northern Holland field that have a lot of twisted and bent seed heads, expulsion holes in the growth nodes and nodes that are cracked. He sent me some very good photographs tonight so I could see and compare them to similar anomalous stems from Avebury, Wiltshire and Whitefish, Montana in 1999. I'll begin with the historic background of the \"somatic developmental abnormalities,\" named by W. C. Levengood, the Michigan biophysicist who has studied plants and soil from crop formations since the early 1990s. 1) Whitefish, Montana: Wheat from Whitefish, Montana, formation found August 6, 1999.

Photograph © 1999 by W. C. Levengood. Biophysicist W. C. Levengood told me in an interview for my book, Mysteri ous Lights and Crop Circles, about the Whitefish and Avebury stem anomalies: \"I was amazed. I've seen abnormalities in the seed heads, but not in the stems.\" \"What do you think happened to the plants?\" He said, \"Sometimes when the energy blasts the plant, the size of the seed is reduced and the vigor is reduced. That means that what hit these plants probably occurred sometime after anthesis, which is after flowering. So, the energies injured the seeds and stem growth. ...The fact is a spinning plasma energy hit that field probably two to three weeks before anthesis. That's the time when instead of the embryonic tissues being at a high metabolism, the tissue most active then was the stem tissue between the head and the first node. And the plasma energy just knocked the heck out of it and distorted it something awful.\" \"So the implication for these somatic abnormalities to be in Avebury and Whitefish is that the plasma containing the microwave energies had to come down into the fields during the active growth of the stems?\" \"Yes, it had to be then because when you germinate the seeds, they are normal. ...What is interesting is that the wheat heads developed normally, but the oat heads were highly deformed and they didn't have any seeds in them. But perhaps that's understandable because wheat and oats develop at different rates. The oats had deformity of the heads as well as the stems. In various parts of all living organisms, one part is growing faster one day and then another kind of tissue grows faster. And here we have two different species, oats and wheat, in two different locations. So the spiraling deformity occurred because the stem between the first growth node and the seed head was growing most rapidly when the plasma energies interacted with the field.\" Some of the Whitefish, Montana deformed plants also had expulsion cavities, which indicates there was a rapid heating of the node cell water and components that exploded outward. Expulsion cavities in stem deformities from Whitefish, Montana, formation discovered August 6, 1999. Photograph © 1999 by W. C.
