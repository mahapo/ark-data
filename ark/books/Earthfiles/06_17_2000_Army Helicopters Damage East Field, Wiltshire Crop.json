Presumed British Army helicopters hovered as low as ten feet above crop and blew down a few hundred square feet. Photograph © 2000 by Peter R. Sorensen. June 17, 2000 East Field, Alton Barnes, Wiltshire, England - Videographer Peter Sorensen e-mailed me alarming and puzzling photographs he took in the East Field on June 15, 2000, one of the Wiltshire fields famous for spectacular crop formations. There is no fresh crop formation in the East Field, only the remnants of the 5-pointed star referred to as the \"Harlequin Pentacle\" discovered there on May 20, 2000. Recently, a 'rook circle' was made by birds that Peter was photographing to compare to the truly mysterious crop formations that glisten and flow like water. Often patterns resemble ancient symbols which imply a profile of high intelligence in whomever, or whatever, is responsible for the enigmatic crop glyphs. Is military intelligence monitoring frequencies from satellites and other listening posts to \"catch\" something associated with crop circle creation? The following is from Peter to the farm's owner, Tim Carson, Alton Barnes: E-mail Number 1 from Peter Sorensen: \"Friday, June 16, 2000 Yesterday while inspecting the rook circle in the East Field, two Army helicopters playing hide-from-the-radar flew in from the south at about thirty feet altitude and one of them stopped to look at the old crop circle there. It hovered at only about ten feet for half a minute and blew down a few hundred square feet of crop before chasing after the other chopper in the direction of Milk Hill. A couple minutes later, both choppers flew along the northern border of the East Field at twenty feet, leaving in their wake a river of damaged crop. Because they flew in follow-the-leader fashion, the second one pushed the crop down farther. This was between 2 and 3 PM. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"I have never seen Army helicopters paying no heed to their damaging crop before. (This is a private farm.) Although I'm sure it was not blown down flat, and the crop will surely recover, if this had happened when the wheat was brown, it could have been a lot more serious. The Army should be informed. I got some video shots of this, but I can not see any identifying numbers - too far away. If you would like me to e-mail you some frames of the video, at least the types of helicopters can be identified for proof. I would be happy to 'grab' them off the tape and e-mail them to you.\" Then today, Saturday, June 17, 2000, I received Peter's photographs with this e-mail: E-mail Number 2 from Peter: \"Here are two shots of the helicopters damaging the crop in the East Field. The first chopper is seen just as it started to leave the Harlequin Pentacle formation, just out of frame to the right. Both aircraft then went off in the direction towards Milk Hill. But a few minutes later, they came back, skirting along the edge of the north border of the East Field, downing crop the whole way. The second chopper is seen following the first by about fifteen seconds and you can see that it is going in exactly the same path as the first. Note the damage trail left by the first is being further damaged by the second chopper.\" East Field, Alton Barnes, Wiltshire, England. Photograph © 2000 by Peter R. Sorensen.
