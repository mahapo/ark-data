S. and Canada since at least the 1980s. Photograph © 2003 by Cherie Good, D.V.M., Bothel. Updated September 4, 2007 Edmonton, Alberta, Canada - On Saturday, September 1, 2007, a cat was found dead and mutilated behind Holy Cross School in Edmonton. Edmonton Police Service Sgt. Jeff Anderson confirmed the cat had been partially skinned and some of its internal organs had been removed without blood. He also confirmed that the cat had a collar tag and on August 26th had been reported missing from a residence three blocks from the Holy Cross School. This would be at least the 22nd mutilated cat reported in Edmonton over the past year. Police and the Edmonton Humane Society are warning residents to keep their cats inside. If anyone has any information, please call the Edmonton Police Service at: 780-423-4567. Updated August 30 /August 29, 2007 - I have been reporting about half cat mutilations since the 1980s. I have interviewed grieving cat owners and Societies for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in London, all over Canada and from the west to the east and Gulf coasts of the United States. To date, no one has ever been arrested, arraigned and convicted on one of the bloodless half cat mutilation assaults. Now between August 19th and 24th, 2007, in Barrie, Ontario, Canada, north of Toronto on the west side of Lake Simcoe, the back half of one cat was found August 19th, the front half of another two days later on August 21st and two days after that on August 23rd, another front half of a cat was found. The general lack of blood and fur at most scenes suggests to authorities that the cats were taken, cut in half in another location and the halves returned for reasons unknown to the neighborhood lawns where the half cats have been found. Ontario, Canada: Cat Mutilations Barrie, Ontario, Canada, August 19 - 24, 2007 "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"B arrie, Ontario, Canada is north of Toronto on the west side of Lake Simcoe. Beaverton, Ontario, is directly to the east of Barrie across Lake Simcoe. Both tow ns have had half cat mutil ati ons i n past ni ne months. T he most recent top half of a cat found on August 23rd, was near a popular walking trail off Ferndale on the north side of Barrie – the opposite side of town from the first two in the south. The next day on August 24th, Rachel Banks who is the Animal Cruelty Investigator for the Barrie SPCA, went to the scene. This was her 3rd half cat investigation and the first three in her five years of working animal cruelty in Barrie, Ontario, Canada. O n Friday, August 24, 2007, Rachel Banks on left, Animal Cruelty Investigator for the Barrie, Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (OSPCA), and branch manager, Sandra Kiyonaga, bagged the third and most recently mutilated cat found in Barrie, along the Nine-Mile Portage Trail, off Ferndale Drive North.

Interview: Rachel Banks, Animal Cruelty Investigator, Barrie Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (OSPCA), Barrie, Ontario, Canada: “It’s been going on a week and a half now – we found the remains unfortunately of three ordinary short-haired domestic cats that look to be mutilated and dismembered. We do not believe that these"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"injuries and mutilations were caused by other animals. It looks like there is more human involvement. COULD YOU PLEASE DESCRIBE EACH OF THE THREE CATS AS THEY WERE FOUND? I can give you what I’m allowed to, certainly. I can let you know that each of the cats was found cut in half, unfortunately. The first one we were only able to locate the bottom half (August 19). The second one we were only able to find the top half (August 21). There was only the top half in the third cat as well (found August 23, Banks investigated August 24). The third also had its legs cut off and placed beside it. ON THIS THIRD CAT, IT IS THE FRONT HALF OF THE CAT THAT WAS THERE AND LYING NEXT TO IT WERE THERE TWO OR FOUR LEGS THAT HAD BEEN CUT OFF AND LAYED NEXT TO THE FRONT HALF? There were only two legs placed next to the body. The other two legs were not found. WERE THEY THE TWO FRONT LEGS? They were. “We haven’t been able to locate the owners of the cats based on the half remains we did find. All were healthy adult cats. One was wearing a collar. Unfortunately, it had no tags. They were all three well-groomed, well cared for cats, so we are assuming these are owned cats. And we have had some inquiries from people as well as some photographs dropped off (for comparison) to try to I. D. these animals. But nothing concrete yet, unfortunately. WAS EACH CAT FOUND IN A FRONT YARD OR BACK YARD OF A HOUSE? The first cat was found in the back yard of a fairly new, busy residential area here in town. The second cat was found a few kilometers away – I believe at a local high school in their football field. The third cat was found on the other side of town on a popular dog-walking trail. THE FIRST TWO CATS WERE ON WHICH SIDE OF BARRIE? On the south end of Barrie. AND THE THIRD CAT WAS FOUND IN WHAT DIRECTION? In the north end. TOTALLY THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF TOWN? Yes. (about 10 kilometers apart) DID YOU GO TO EACH SITE? I did. DID YOU SEE SIGNS OF FUR, BLOOD OR STRUGGLE? Not in the first two. There was nothing out of the ordinary to indicate these cats were killed or had a struggle at the sites. The third one we found was a little more odd. The woman who had reported it, she found it when she thought it was newly deceased, so she did note some blood. By the time we got there the next day, there was no blood. However, there was fur. So, it did look like some sort of struggle had occurred, or if it’s a criminal act we’re looking into that it occurred at that spot. IN THE FIRST TWO CATS – WHICH IS SO TYPICAL OF HALF CAT MUTILATIONS OVER AT LEAST THE PAST THIRTY SOME YEARS – WHAT ALWAYS IMPRESSES LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PEOPLE WHO OWN THE CATS IS THE SCENE IS BLOODLESS, CLEAN, NO SIGNS OF STRUGGLE. WOULD THAT SUGGEST TO YOU THAT THE CATS ARE PICKED UP, TAKEN SOME PLACE, AND THEN RETURNED? It looks as if the first two were. We can’t say with definitive certainty right now, but it does look as if they were placed in the locations that we found them. WHEN YOU TALK WITH POLICE AND AUTHORITIES ABOUT THAT, WHAT IS THEIR COMMENT ABOUT THE PROCESS OF TAKING THE ANIMALS FROM THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS TO SOME PLACE, CUTTING THEM IN HALF AND RETURNING ONLY THE FRONT OR BACK HALF BLOODLESS?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Certainly they are concerned. It’s not a very usual occurrence here in this town. We’ve never dealt with it before and everyone is quite horrified by this if these acts are being committed by a resident of our community. Certainly, they are very concerned. There is a definitive link between cruelty towards animals and continuing on eventually leading to violence and cruelty towards people. Certainly, the police are very concerned about this as well. DO YOU OR ANY OF THE AUTHORITIES INVESTIGATING THIS SPECULATE HOW THIS PROCESS OF GETTING THE CATS, TAKING THEM SOME PLACE ELSE, CUTTING THEM IN HALF AND RETURNING THEM IS ACCOMPLISHED? Everything is pending the necropsy reports. We’re not sure how these acts were done, what weapon these acts were committed with or anything like that. But I have to reiterate that it does look like the first two cats that were found were certainly injured or killed in another location and then taken and dumped at the locations found. All three sites are popular areas in the neighborhoods and they were placed in such a way to lead us to believe that somebody wanted them to be found. So, whether it’s an adult who has some sort of a large fenced back yard away from people where nobody is going to notice, or a basement perhaps, or a local teenager? We’re not sure at this point in time of how they are doing this. But we are hoping that the necropsy reports will give us a better idea after they have studied the cuts and bones – what these acts were committed with and whether they were pre-mortem, or post-mortem will give us a better idea of what we’re looking for anyway. WHO IS DOING THE NECROPSIES? We’re sending them down to the University of Guelph (Gwelf), which is our leading animal laboratory in Canada. DO YOU KNOW WHEN THEY EXPECT THE RESULTS OF THE NECROPSIES ARE AVAILABLE? I’m hoping in the next few days. It depends on how many emergency cases they get. They work very closely with us. We’re estimating another couple of days. HAVE YOU ASKED THEM TO CHECK THE EXCISIONS FOR EVIDENCE OF HIGH HEAT ? We’ve asked for any information they can give us on the incisions – anything at all – if there is high heat involved, if there is a blade that’s involved? What kind of blade? Everything. They are pretty much doing a complete work up for us. IN WORK I DID WITH A HEMATOLOGIST/PATHOLOGIST IN DENVER IN THE EARLY 1990S, INVOLVING HALF CATS FOUND IN VANCOUVER, B. C. AN OFFICE THERE SHIPPED ONE OF THE FRONT HALF CATS TO THE HEMATOLGIST/PATHOLOGIST IN DENVER, JOHN ALTSHULER, M. D. IN HIS EXAMINATION, HE CONFIRMED THAT THE ENTIRE EXCISION OF THE CAT HAD BEEN DONE WITH HIGH HEAT, HOT ENOUGH TO COOK THE HEMOGLOBIN AND COLAGEN. Wow. I’ll certainly put a call into the university and let them know they should look for that as well. This is a very odd case for us in Barrie and we are not generally used to dealing with situations like this. Usually we deal with animals that are alive and we’re able to help. So, it’s quite frustrating for us in this case that I’m now not only dealing with deceased animals, but ones that have also been mutilated. So, we’re certainly hoping that we can find an answer to what is going on - it’s certainly odd!” B arrie Police Sergeant, David Goodbrand, told The Barrie Examiner, \"Some of our most serious criminals and serial killers started by mutilating animals. You wonder what’s going on in that person’s head. Is this someone who really hates cats, or is doing this for his own enjoyment?” Police are waiting for necropsy results.

Previous Ontario Half Cats"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Beaverton, Ontario, November 21, 2006 To the east of Barrie across Lake Simcoe, is Beaverton, Ontario. Nine months ago on November 21, 2006, a 9-year-old family cat named Tigger raised from kittenhood by its owner, Kim Besaw, was also found \"cut clean in half.\" In that case, the back half of the cat had been left on a neighbor's lawn. Both the Durham Regional Police and Durham Humane Society investigated and confirmed that a number of pets had been reported missing from the Beaverton region in the weeks following the gruesome death of Tigger. The Durham Humane Society: (905) 433-3965 or Durham Regional Police Service: (888) 579-1520. Debbie Houghton of the Durham Humane Society and the Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (OSPCA) has investigated half cats before. In late 1999 to 2000, Toronto police and OSPCA investigated at least ten cases, but no perpetrator was ever found. During the first week of November 1999, a $60,000 reward was offered by the Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals for information about ten mutilated cats after that round of half cats began in August 1999. During that same time period in 1999, beyond Ontario, Canada, half cats were also being reported in London, England; San Jose, California; and Ft. Worth, Texas. Over the past couple of decades, odd cat mutilations have also been investigated repeatedly in Plano, Texas; Tustin, California; Falls Church, Virginia and several other U. S. and Canadian regions.

E dmonton, Alberta, Peace Officer J. Ostapiwa, Edmonton Police Sgt. Duane Hunter, and Humane Officer J. Olson are part of a joint task force investigating recent cat killings. Image © 2007 by Walter Tychnowicz, Edmonton Journal. A s of August 29, 2007, there have been four cat mutilations in St. Albert, Alberta, Canada, a northern suburb of Edmonton, since July 2007, bringing the total to at least twenty-one cat mutilations officially reported in the Edmonton region over the past several months, including five last summer of 2006. Recently, the Edmonton Humane Society, Edmonton police and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) met to discuss the cat mutilation phenomenon and to form a joint task force for investigations. Officials aren't releasing details of the deaths yet during the ongoing investigations, but it is presumed to be the same half cat syndrome as in Ontario. A veterinary pathologist has been asked to examine cat mutilations for the task force as well. So far, authorities have no suspects. \"We're always asking for the public's help, and we"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"would like them to report every instance they think is a suspicious cat death - or other suspicious animal death - and bring it to our attention as well as the humane society's attention,\" said Edmonton Police Sgt.

Beginning with the purple circle on right at Destin and going west, the other three sites are Fort Walton Beach, Mary Esther and Navarre. I n the April to May 2006, in Destin, Florida, another round of bloodless half cat mutilations were reported, especially along Holly Street. Tony Tenore found his cat cut in half on his front yard lawn. Half a dozen other neighbors have found mutilated cats in their yards. And at the end of May, Henry Boenning, who lives only a couple of doors from Tony Tenore, found his 16-year-old cat gutted without blood. Since then, Florida Okaloosa County Sheriff’s deputies and animal control officers still have unsolved cases about mutilated cats in Destin and Fort Walton Beach. Only two months ago, 14-year-old Jackie Gibson's cat, Bubba, was found mutilated with a sharp instrument in the Kell-Aire Gardens region of Destin and placed in a neighbor's yard on June 26, 2007. The Northwest Florida Daily News reported, \"Bubba’s death is one of two recent cat deaths that have been confirmed as being done by a human. The other one happened two days later on June 28,2007, in Mary Esther. The cases are eerily reminiscent of a rash of cat cruelty cases that occurred last summer in 2006. Investigators are looking into a possible connection. \"Three of the cats — including Bubba — lived on Kell-Aire Court in Destin. The details of the deaths are grisly. Many of the cats were found skinned and missing parts. Some of them were cut in half. In the case of the dead cat in Mary Esther, the front half of the cat was never found. “'We have so few of these and they are so close in proximity. It’s a possibility (they’re connected),' said Okaloosa County Sheriff’s Office Investigator Lori Yanna. “(The veterinarian) pretty much told us there’s no way any animal could’ve done that.” The Sheriff has also ruled out satanic practices."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"As in the Canadian cases, there is no blood or struggle at the scenes of discovery, implying that \"these cats are being caught, taken somewhere else and brought back.\" On August 7, 2007, the Humane Society of the United States posted this notice at their website: “ Reward Offered In Destin, Florida, Cat Cruelty Case August 7, 2007 TALLAHASSEE, Fla.—The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) is offering a reward of up to $2,500 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible for killing and mutilating cats in Destin, Florida. The Case: A 13- year-old cat named Bubba was found mutilated in a resident's yard on June 26 in the Kell-Aire Gardens neighborhood of Destin. Another cat was found mutilated in nearby Mary Esther two days later. Investigators believe the cats' death may be related to a rash of cat killings last summer. In both cases, veterinarians determined the cats were mutilated with an instrument. The cats appear to have been removed from the scene and returned post-mortem. Animal Cruelty: The connection between animal cruelty and human violence is well documented. The HSUS First Strike Campaign® raises public awareness and educates communities about this connection while providing a variety of resources to law enforcement agencies, social work professionals, educators, legislators and fam ilies.

The suffering dog was taken to the Raytown Animal Clinic for examination and treatment where the remainder of her leg was amputated. One week later, on August 21st, a second homeless Rottweiler was found with about half its left hind leg cut off. That dog was taken to the Raytown Animal Clinic where Dr. Heath Rose said he would probably have to amputate again, as he had Misty's leg. “Why? - is the main question - why this would happen or occur? And that's yet to be known.” he told KSHB-TV in Kansas City. 1 - year-old stray Rottweiler found August 21, 2007, with about half his leg cut off.
