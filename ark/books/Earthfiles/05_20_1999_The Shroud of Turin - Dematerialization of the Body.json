It has the front and back images of a crucified man as if the linen had been wrapped around the body from the feet up over the head and back down to the feet, leaving complete front and back images -- including what appear to be bloodstains. The sharp detail of the blood combined with what appear to be teeth and bones on the cloth have provoked several scientists to hypothesize that intense radiation involving light and x-ray frequencies produced the images on the linen. The Shroud was photographed in 1931 and 1978 and you can visit www.shroud.com for more information about international Shroud research. One researcher is Thaddeus Trenn, Ph.D., Director of the Science and Religion Course Program at the University of Toronto, Canada. Prof. Trenn has an M. A. in Physics and a Ph.D. in the History of Science. He hypothesizes that the body inside the Shroud experienced a dematerialization due to the influx of intense energy that overcame the strong forces that bind the protons and neutrons, and released the matter into energy -- instantly. He was provoked into formulating his hypothesis by the work of other scientists who have shown evidence that the Shroud images are x-rays. No one knows what excited x-rays in the bones and teeth to move outward through the skin into the linen, but Dr. Trenn thinks that x-ray energy might be the by-product of the primary dematerialization event. Interview: Thaddeus Trenn, Ph.D., Director, Science and Religioin Course Program, University of Toronto, Canada : \"This is terribly hypothetical. I'm just simply saying I see the x-ray phenomenon as a secondary event taking place after the primary event that I'm talking about. That's where I come in with Carter and the others. I'm starting with there was a triggering event that will release at the secondary follow on event such things as the x-rays Giles Carter has noted. RIGHT. AND THE PRIMARY EVENT WHICH, AS DR. CARTER SAYS, COULD BE THE PROCESS OF RESURRECTION WHICH SCIENCE HAS NO KNOWLEDGE ABOUT, BUT IS AT LEAST A HANDLE TO PLACE ON IT. AND WE'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS PROCESS OF RESURRECTION MIGHT HAVE BEEN THAT LEFT THIS IMAGE ON THIS LINEN. Right. And my suggestion is that if you were to allow for the possibility that the strong force could be overcome -- in other words, an influx of energy in the amount we already know what it has to be (1% of the mass), if that could somehow happen, then certain things would follow: And one of them is that the binding of the protons and neutrons would no longer hold. You would have a separation of the basic nucleons of matter. All your nuclei would come unstuck. And therefore, all these secondary phenomenon such as the release of x-rays would take place. That's how it is. He called it he Resurrection Event. I'm simply saying, all right, you can call it that. But there is a physical process here that if we could control in some way -- we can't, but if it could be somehow controlled, that would happen. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"AND THAT'S WHY THE DEMATERIALIZATION? And that's why the dematerialization. AND IF YOU WERE GOING FURTHER WITH THE HYPOTHESIS TO GIVE A WORD PICTURE OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO A BODY THAT WOULD BE DEMATERIALIZING THIS WAY -- WHAT DO YOU THINK WE MIGHT SEE? Well, you'd see the following -- first of all, you would see no more body. It would instantly be gone. All you would have is protons and neutrons in various states of energy and other particles that would come such as pions- they would be about ten to the minus twenty-second seconds -- you would have the release of pions and muons, heavy electrons. These could in short range bombard the cloth and produce the effect you do see on the image. WOULD YOU AGREE THAT IT APPEARS TO BE AS MUCH AN X-RAY AS A PHOTOGRAPH? I know it's very controversial, but x-rays can make an image. AND THEN THE ISSUE WOULD BE: WHAT FORCE IN THE UNIVERSE COULD CONTAIN THAT AMOUNT OF ENERGY INFLUX TO CAUSE A DEMATERIALIZATION? Yes. And I don't think there is any in Nature. I don't think it's going to be repeated. I doubt very much if you are going to see us being able to control this sort of thing. It's a problem, it really is! And I'm not saying I have the answer here by any means. I'm just saying that if you do allow for various things, including the x-rays that very likely are coming out. How could they possibly come out unless there was a prior event of that sort. THAT EXCITED THE X-RAYS... Right. WITHIN THE BONES AND TEETH... Right, exactly. Where are these x-rays going to come from? And they would naturally come as a spin-off from this kind of primary event. AND THEN IT IS THE QUESTION JUST LIKE TALKING ABOUT WHITE AND BLACK HOLES -- IS THIS A SINGULARITY? A UNIQUE EVENT? Right. And I have to say I think it is, but again, how can I prove it? You can't really prove it. Such things, if they only happen once, obviously you can't prove it. But I'm looking for a physical trigger that could allow for -- if there are x-rays, these are physical things. Then why couldn't there be a physical prior event? And what would that look like? And that's why I've come up with this idea. But there's another reason -- and that's John Jackson's idea - I don't know if you have read about this, but he sees distortions in the Shroud that indicate what he calls the collapsing of the Shroud on the body itself. And it would have to happen almost instantaneously for these kinds of distortions to happen. And then, one of the other gentlemen -- Goldstein, or Goldberg -- came up with the blood hypothesis -- that the blood on the Shroud was in fact de-coupled from the body itself in such a way there is no pulling away of the fibrils. And how could this happen unless the body sort of disappeared instantly? In other words, it wasn't pulled out of there. Nobody taking the body out. RIGHT, AND THAT THE BLOOD HAS THIS REMARKABLE SHARPNESS TO IT. Exactly. And you put those three things together and you come to the conclusion, I think, that something happened instantaneously that made it disappear! Not that it was taken out, but it disappeared. THAT THE BODY LITERALLY DISAPPEARED LEAVING THE BLOOD INTACT WITH THE SHROUD."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Correct. And the x-rays would be a natural spin-off of such a disappearing. Well, what would that disappearing look like in terms of physics. And then you do the calculation back and you find there is only one way -- and that is for the units of matter that we ordinarily call nucleons of matter -- decouple. And the only way to get that is to overcome the strong force. Incredible, as it seems, we can back out into this Nowheresville -- it's an impossible situation. But, that's what you're left with. I SEE. AND THEN YOU GET TO, AS DR. CARTER SAID, WHAT IS THE PROCESS OF RESURRECTION? -- WHICH WE HAVE AS A HUGE MYSTERY. AND THAT IN THAT PROCESS OF RESURRECTION THAT COULD BE A SINGULARITY, YOU ARE SAYING THERE COULD HAVE BEEN AN INFLUX OF ENERGY EQUAL TO THAT IN, SAY THE FISSION OF AN ATOMIC BOMB, BUT AN INFLUX INTO THE BODY FROM A SOURCE UNKNOWN THAT WOULD HAVE DECOUPLED THE NEUTRON, PROTON LEVEL AND THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN INSTANT DEMATERIALIZATION... Weak dematerialization, as opposed to, for example, that any particular nucleon like hydrogen would be evaporated. BUT THIS WOULD HAVE AFFECTED THE BODY LITERALLY DISAPPEARING MOLECULARLY FROM INSIDE THE SHROUD WHICH WOULD HAVE COLLAPSED ON THE STONE WITH THE BLOOD STILL INTACT ON THE SHROUD, BUT THE WHOLE BODY WOULD BE GONE. Yes, instantaneously. Like really instantaneously. So that when the collapsing takes place in John Jackson's idea, that it would in fact be measuring -- the distortion that he measured -- is actually an indication of the speed with which the body by gravity would be collapsing on top of the (cloth), and the body would be disappearing -- in other words, gravity is still pulling on the cloth. And the image of those x-rays and what I'm going to suggest, a special electron, a heavy electron -- I call them muons -- would be a byproduct also of this DEMATERIALIZATION. Dematerialization that would impinge on a cloth that is moving, moving down. HAS ANYBODY EVER EXAMINED THE CAVE THAT IS STILL...? Good question. This is something that several people have suggested. Shouldn't you then in the Sepulchre, shouldn't you find some sort of distortion? This is a wonderful idea, and you could have changes in the isotopic distribution on the surface of the walls. You could imagine unusual isotopic conformities there. IN THE STONE. In the stone. Yes. WOULD THERE BE AN INCREASE IN NEUTRONS PRESENT? I would have thought so. It would be captured, these neutrons, would be captured by other elements. But again, that's a question for geologists and others who are more competent in that sort of thing than I. But I think there could be effects that you should explore. AND SO, A HYPOTHESIS COULD BE MADE THAT IF THERE WAS A DEMATERIALIZATION EVENT WHERE THE SHROUD WAS INSIDE THE CAVE THAT TODAY WE WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO FIND AN ELEVATED NUMBER OF NEUTRONS IN THAT CAVE WALL? Not necessarily the neutrons, but in elements that were able to capture these neutrons, you may see a ratio of the isotope of that particular element skewed slightly from the normal. Some of them would be heavier. You wouldn't necessarily find neutrons. You would find neutrons captured by some other nucleus. So you would find some heavy nuclei of a particular element, like silicon for example, then you would find heavy silicon. It would be neutrons captured some how by elements in the cave, in the rock. SO IF YOU COULD GET THE ROCK OR PIECE OF THE WALL IN THE CAVE AND ANALYZE IT FOR ISOTOPIC RATIO ANOMALIES..."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"There you go, that's exactly it. You've got it. WELL, THE CHURCH IS SUPPOSED TO ALLOW THE SHROUD TO BE SHOWN AGAIN IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. IS THERE ANY POSSIBILITY THAT YOU AND OTHERS COULD TRY TO DO SOME MORE TESTING DURING THAT TIME? I can't do any testing. I've talked this point up for the last 5 years to various sources and maybe someone is going to take it in. But there is a way to test, a very simple way, without damaging cloth -- to check the uniformity or homogeneity of carbon-14 throughout the cloth, say in the width. Is there a profile? Is there some kind of differentiation that is non-uniform? If it's non-uniform, then by definition, the assumption that was made in the 1988 dating is flawed. The labs weren't to blame. It's just that they assumed what every normal scientist will assume -- that the sample they had is representative of the whole.\" We b s it e s : www.shroud.com Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
