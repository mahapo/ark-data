He read several of my manuscripts and supplied them with marginal notes. Of Earth in Upheaval he read chapters VIII through XII; he made handwritten comments on this and other manuscripts and spent not a few long afternoons and evenings, often till midnight, discussing and debating with me the implications of my theories. In the last"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"vi ACKNOWLEDGMENTS weeks of his life he reread Worlds in Collision and read also three files of \"memoirs\" on that book and its reception, and expressed his thoughts in writing. We started at opposite points; the area of disagreement, as reflected in our correspondence, grew ever smaller, and though at his death (our last meeting was nine days before his passing) there remained clearly defined points of disagreement, his stand then demonstrated the evolution of his opinion in the space of eighteen months. Professor Waldo S. Clock, Chairman of the Depart- ment of Geology at Macalester College, St. Paul, Minnesota, a recognized authority in dendrochronology (dating of tree rings), with the help of his graduate students searched the literature pertaining to the tree rings of early ages, and also gave me answers to ques- tions in his field. Dr. H. Manley of the Imperial College, London, Professor P. L. Mercanton of the University of Lau- sanne, and Professor E. Thellier of the Observatoire Geophysique of the University of Paris, gave me freely of their knowledge in the field of geomagnetism and sent me reprints of their works. Professor Lloyd Motz of the Department of As- tronomy at Columbia University, New York, never tired of testing mathematically and of commenting on various problems in electromagnetism and in celestial mechanics which I offered for discussion. Dr. T. E. Nikulins, geologist in Caracas, Venezuela, repeatedly drew my attention to various publications in the scientific press that might be of help to me; he supplied me with the source dealing with the discovery of the stone and bronze ages in northeastern Siberia. Professor George McCready Price, geologist in Cali- fornia, read an early draft of various chapters of this work. Between this octogenarian, author of several books on geology written from the fundamentalist point of view, and myself, there are some points of agreement and as many of disagreement.

The pages of this book are transcripts of the testimony of mute witnesses, the rocks, in the court of celestial traffic. They testify by their own appearance and by the encased contents of dead bodies, fossilized skele- tons. Myriads upon myriads of living creatures came to life on this ball of rock suspended in nothing and returned to dust. Many died a natural death, many were killed in wars between races and species, and many were entombed alive during great paroxysms of nature in which land and sea contested in destruction. Whole tribes of fish that had filled the oceans sud- denly ceased to exist; of entire species and even genera of land animals not a single survivor was left. The earth and the water without which we cannot exist suddenly turned into enemies and engulfed the animal kingdom, the human race included, and there was no shelter and no refuge.

In Worlds in Collison I presented the chronicles of two the very last series of such catastrophes, those that visited our earth in the second and first mil- lennia before the present era. Since these upheavals occurred in historical times, when the art of writing had already been perfected in the centers of ancient civiliza- tion, I described them mainly from historical docu- ments, relying on celestial charts, calendars, and sundials and water clocks discovered by archaeologists, and drawing also upon classical literature, the sacred literature of East and West, the epics of the northern races, and the oral traditions of primitive peoples from Lapland to the South Seas. Geological vestiges of the events narrated in documents and traditions were in- dicated only here and there, when I felt that the immediate testimony of the rocks must be presented along with the historical evidence. I closed that descrip- tion of cataclysmic events with a promise to attempt, at a later date, the reconstruction of similar global catastrophes of earlier times, one of them being the Deluge. I had intended, after piecing together the history of these earlier global upheavals, to present geological and paleontological material to support the testimony of man. But the reception of Worlds in Collision by certain scientific groups persuaded me, before reviving the pageant of earlier catastrophes, to present at least some of the evidence of the rocks, which is as insistent as that carried down to our times by written records and by word of mouth. This testimony is never given in metaphors; and as with the pages of the Old Testament or of the Iliad, nothing can be changed in it. Pebbles and rocks and mountains and the bottom of the sea will bear witness. Do they know of the days, recent and ancient, when the harmony of this world was inter- rupted by the forces of nature? Have they entombed innumerable creatures and encased them in rock? Have they seen the ocean moving on continents and conti- nents sliding under water?

Were its forests, uprooted by hurricanes and set afire, covered by tides carrying sand and debris from the bottom of the oceans? It takes millions of years for a log to be turned into coal but only a single hour when burning. Here lies the core of the problem: Did the earth change in a slow process, a year added to a year and a million years to a million, the peaceful ground of nature being the broad arena of the contest of throngs, in which the fittest survived? Or did it happen, too, that the very arena itself, infuriated, rose against the contestants and made an end of their battles? I present here some pages from the book of nature. I have excluded from them all references to ancient literature, traditions, and folklore; and this I have done with intent, so that careless critics cannot decry the entire work as \"tales and legends.\" Stones and bones are the only witnesses. Mute as they are, they will testify clearly and unequivocally. Yet dull ears and dimmed eyes will deny this evidence, and the dimmer the vision, the louder and more insistent will be the voices of protestation.

Yet, in some instances, like the discovery of a great submarine ridge encompassing the globe almost twice, the discoverer (B. Heezen) felt compelled to exclaim in print: The discovery at this late date of the midocean ridge and rift has raised fundamental questions about busic geological processes and the history of the earth and has even had reverberations in cosmology.* At his discovery of the whitish ash underlying the beds of all oceans and seas, the so-called Worzel Ash, J.

At the same college a \"Center for Velikovskian and Interdisciplinary Studies\" collects an archive and publishes books.* I said that I would not revoke anything from the original edition of 1955. However, to one section I would like to make some pertinent remarks. By the 1950's, the hypothesis (1920) of A. Wegener about Drifting Continents gained in acceptance; at the 1950 annual meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, a roll call showed equal numbers of supporters and opponents. In the later sixties, the trend took a dramatic turn: the ever unsatisfactory part of the hypothesis the nature of the force that causes the continents to drift, an unequal attraction of the moon on various latitudes (Wegener); and periodical radioactive heating of the interior of the Earth (DuToit) was tackled anew. And in some, un- intended way, I had a part in it. Here is the story: The Forum Address (before the Graduate Forum of Princeton University), printed as a Supplement at the end of this book, was read on October 14, 1953. In it I claimed that Jupiter, being a charged body, emits radiosignals; that the Earth, being a charged body, possesses a magnetosphere and further that this magneto- sphere reaches all the way to the lunar orbit. All three claims were subsequently confirmed under dramatic cir- cumstances, and mark epochal detections. 1 *** * The most recent (August, 1977) publication is the Index to Vell- /coi'sfcy, by Alice Miller (300 pages). ** In 1963, Hess made a public statement in reference to the large number ot scientific advance claims, that also included the charged of celestial bodies, the high heat of Venus, etc.: \"Some of these"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"xxii AUTHOR'S NOTE But under pressure of a campaign led by the elite of the scientific community, I was barred for over nine years from any contact with the student body, except when H. H. Hess had his say. A number of times, following the publication of Earth in Upheaval late in 1955, Hess invited me to speak to an audience of the professors and graduate students of his department. My position on con- tinental drift was (and is) intermediary between that of those who reject this concept (H. Jeffreys, the leading British geophysicist, and V. V. Beloussov, the leading Russian geophysicist, never ceased to be its most out- spoken opponents) and those who support the idea. I would, therefore, not recognize the outline of the present continents as everlasting features, only extended by the drift of continents. The moving force was there; by inertia, the displacement of the strata could continue at an ever diminishing rate, for centuries; the volcanic activity and earthquakes I described resulting from these very occurrences, and decreasing with time. Once a professor from the University of Rhodesia came to a lecture at the same auditorium where I usually offered my challenge, and told that his expedition found the magnetic remanent intensity of lavas in Somalia and Ethiopia a thousand-fold stronger than the terrestrial magnetic field (half a gauss) could invest in these lavas when cooling below the Pierre Curie point. Further he described that in Arabia the magnetic remanent direction was found reversed from that of neighboring Somalia and Ethiopia on the African coast. Once more I teased the audience: \"You have to turn around Arabia in relation to Africa if you wish to explain the phenomena by continental drift. And the thousand-fold strong magnetic remanence you cannot explain even by rotating Arabia.\" One day Hess showed me a design he was making of loops of magma traveling from the molten interior of the Earth toward its crust. He wished to hear my opinion on such loops as a source of energy for moving con- tinents. I did not show appreciation of such loops, entirely hypothetical, actually figments of an imagination. predictions were said to be impossible wben you made them.

From the Tanana Valley and the valleys of its tributaries gold is mined out of gravel and \"muck.*' This muck is a frozen mass of animals and trees. F. Rainey of the University of Alaska described the scene: l \"Wide cuts, often several miles in length and sometimes as much as 140 feet in depth, are now being sluiced out along stream valleys tributary to the Tanana in the Fairbanks District. In order to reach gold-bearing gravel beds an overburden of frozen silt or 'muck' is removed with hydraulic giants. This 4 muck' contains enormous numbers of frozen bones of extinct animals such as the mammoth, mastodon, super-bison and horse.\" 2 These animals perished in rather recent times; present estimates place their extinction at the end of the Ice Age or in early post-glacial times. The soil of Alaska covered their bodies together with those of animals of species still surviving. 1 F.

F. C. Hibben of the University of New Mexico writes: \"Although the formation of the deposits of muck is not clear, there is ample evidence that at least portions of this material were deposited under catastrophic conditions. Mammal remains are for the most part dismembered and disarticulated, even though some fragments yet retain, in their frozen state, portions of ligaments, skin, hair, and flesh. Twisted and torn trees are piled in splintered masses. ... At least four considerable layers of volcanic ash may be traced in these deposits, although they are extremely warped and distorted. . . .\" 3 Could it be that a volcanic eruption killed the animal population of Alaska, the streams carrying down into the valleys the bodies of the slaughtered animals? A volcanic eruption would have charred the trees but would not have uprooted and splintered them; if it killed animals, it would not have dismembered them. The presence of vol- canic ash indicates that a volcanic eruption did take place, and repeatedly, in four consecutive stages of the same epoch; but it is also apparent that the trees could have been uprooted and splintered only by hurricane or flood or a combination of both agencies. The animals could have been dismembered only by a stupendous wave that lifted and carried and smashed and tore and buried millions of bodies and millions of trees. Also, the area of the catastrophe was much greater than the action of a few volcanoes could have covered. Muck deposits like those of the Tanana River Valley are found in the lower reaches of the Yukon in the west- ern part of the peninsula, on the Koyukuk River that flows into the Yukon from the north, on the Kuskokwim River that empties its waters into Bering Sea, and at several places along the Arctic coast, and so \"may be considered to extend in greater or lesser thickness over all unglaciated areas of the northern peninsula.\" 4 What could have caused the Arctic Sea and the Pacific Ocean to irrupt and wash away forests with all their ani- mal population and throw the entire mingled mass in 3 F.

Was it not a tectonic revolution in the earth's crust, that also caused the volcanoes to erupt and to cover the peninsula with ashes? In various levels of the muck, stone artifacts were found \"frozen in situ at great depths and in apparent associa- tion\" with the Ice Age fauna, which implies that \"men were contemporary with extinct animals in Alaska.\" 5 Worked flints, characteristically shaped, called Yuma points, were repeatedly found hi the Alaskan muck, one hundred and more feet below the surface. One such spear point was found there between a lion's jaw and a mam- moth's tusk. 6 Similar weapons were used only a few generations ago by the Indians of the Athapascan tribe, who camped in the upper Tanana Valley. 7 \"It has also been suggested that even modern Eskimo points are re- markably Yuma-like,\" 8 all of which indicates that the multitudes of torn animals and splintered forests date ironi a time not many thousand years ago.

The sea is passable for ships maneuvering between float- ing ice for two months of the year; from September to the middle of July the ocean north of Siberia is fettered, an unbroken desert of ice. Polar winds sweep over the frozen tundras of Siberia, where no tree grows and the soil is never tilled. In his exploratory voyage on the ship Vega in 1878, Nils Adolf Erik Nordenskjold, the first to traverse this northern seaway from one end to the other, traveled for weeks along the coast from Novaya Zemlya to Cape Shelagskoi (170 30' East) on the eastern extrem- ity of Siberia without seeing a single human being on the shore.

The Chinese excelled in working delicate designs in the ivory, much of which they obtained from the north. And from the days of the conquest of Siberia (1582) by the Cossack Yermak under Ivan the Terrible, until our own times, trade in mammoths' tusks has gone on. Northern Siberia provided more than half the world's supply of ivory, many piano keys and many billiard balls being made from the fossil tusks of these mammoths. In 1797 the body of a mammoth, with flesh, skin, and hair, was found in northeastern Siberia, and since then bodies of other mammoths have been unearthed from the frozen ground in various parts of that region. The flesh had the appearance of freshly frozen beef; it was edible, and wolves and sledge dogs fed on it without harm. 1 The ground must have been frozen ever since the day of their entombment; had it not been frozen, the bodies of the mammoths would have putrefied in a single sum- mer, but they remained unspoiled for some thousands of years. \"It is therefore absolutely necessary to believe that the bodies were frozen up immediately after the animals died, and were never once thawed, until the day of their discovery.\" 2 ^ High in the north above Siberia, six hundred miles in- side the Polar Circle, in the Arctic Ocean, lie the Liakhov Islands.

Not on the lichens of the Siberian tundras, covered by deep snow most of the year, and still less on the moss of the polar islands, which are frozen ten months in the year: mam- moths, members of the voracious elephant family, re- quired huge quantities of vegetable food every day in the year. How could large herds of them have existed in a country like northeast Siberia, which is regarded as the coldest place in the world, and where there was no food for them? Mammoth tusks have been dredged in nets from the bottom of the Arctic Ocean; and after arctic gales the shores of the islands are strewn with tusks cast up by the billows. This is regarded as an indication that the bottom of the Arctic Ocean between the islands and the main- land was dry land in the days when mammoths roamed there. Georges Cuvier, the great French paleontologist (1769- 1832), thought that in a vast catastrophe of continental dimensions the sea overwhelmed the land, the herds of mammoths perished, and in a second spasmodic move- ment the sea rushed away, leaving the carcasses behind. This catastrophe must have been accompanied by a pre- cipitous drop in temperature; the frost seized the dead bodies and saved them from decomposition. 6 In some mammoths, when discovered, even the eyeballs were still preserved. Charles Darwin, who denied the occurrence of con- tinental catastrophes in the past, in a letter to Sir Henry Howorth admitted that the extinction of mammoths in Siberia was for him an insoluble problem. 7 J.

Microscopic examination of the skin showed red blood corpuscles, which was a proof not only of a sudden death, but that the death was due to suffocation either by gases or water, evidently the latter in this case. But the puzzle remained to account for the sudden freezing up of this large mass of flesh so as to preserve it for future ages.\" 9 What could have caused a sudden change in the temperature of the region? Today the country does not provide food for large quadrupeds, the soil is barren and produces only moss and fungi a few months in the year; at that time the animals fed on plants. And not only mammoths pastured in northern Siberia and on the islands of the Arctic Ocean. On Kotelnoi Island \"neither trees, nor shrubs, nor bushes, exist . . . and yet the bones of elephants, rhinoceroses, buffaloes, and horses are found in this icy wilderness in numbers which defy all calculation.\" 10 When Hedenstrom and Sannikov discovered the New Siberian Islands in 1806, they found in the \"desolate wilderness\" of polar sea the remains of \"enormous petri- fied forests.\" These forests could be seen tens of miles away. \"The trunks of the trees in these ruins of ancient forests were partly standing upright and partly lying horizontally buried in the frozen soil. Their extent was very great. 11 Hedenstrom described them as follows: \"On the southern coast of New Siberia are found the remark- able wood hills [piles of trunks].

In 1829 the German scientist G. A. Erman went to the Liakhov and the New Siberian islands to measure there the magnetic field of the earth. He described the soil as full of the bones of elephants, rhinoceroses, and buffaloes. Of the piles of wood he wrote: \"In New Siberia [Island], on the declivities facing the south, lie hills 250 or 300 feet high, formed of driftwood, the ancient origin of which, as well as of the fossil wood in the tundras, anterior to the history of the Earth in its present state, strikes at once even the most uneducated hunters. . . . Other hills on the same island, and on Kotelnoi, which lies further to the west, are heaped up to an equal height with skeletons of pachyderms [elephants, rhinoceroses], bisons, etc., which are cemented together by frozen sand as well as by strata and veins of ice. ... On the summit of the hills they [the trunks of trees] lie flung upon one another in the wildest disorder, forced upright in spite of gravitation, and with their tops broken off or crushed, as if they had been thrown with great violence from the south on a bank, and there heaped up.\" 1S Eduard von Toll repeatedly visited the New Siberian Islands from 1885 to 1902, when he perished in the Arctic Ocean. He examined the \"wood hills\" and \"found them to consist of carbonized trunks of trees, with im- pressions of leaves and fruits.\" u On Maloi, one of the group of Liakhov Islands, Toll found bones of mammoths and other animals together with the trunks of fossil trees, with leaves and cones. \"This striking discovery proves that in the days when the mammoths and rhinoceroses lived in northern Siberia, these desolate islands were covered with great forests, and bore a luxuriant vegetation.\" 15 A hurricane, apparently, uprooted the trees of Siberia and flung them to the extreme north; mountainous waves 12 F P.

These petrified forests were swept from northern Siberia into the ocean, and together with bones of animals and drifted sand built the islands. It may be that not all the charred trees and the mammoths and other animals were destroyed and swept away in a single catastrophe. It is more probable that one huge cemetery of animals and trees came flying through the air on the crest of a retreat- ing tidal wave to settle astride another, older, cemetery, deep in the Polar Circle. The scientists who explored the \"muck\" beds of Alaska have not reflected upon the similarity in appearance of animal remains there and in the polar regions of Siberia and on arctic islands, and have therefore not discussed a common cause.

These two observations one old, one new came from the north. Before presenting many more from all parts of the world, I shall review a few dominant theories on the history of our earth and its animal kingdom. We shall read in brief, in the original statements of the authors, how the earlier naturalists explained the phenomena; how, subsequently, the same phenomena were interpreted in terms of slow evolution; and how in the last fourscore years more and more facts have presented themselves that do not square with the picture of a peaceful world molded in a slow and uneventful process."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"CHAPTER II REVOLUTION The Erratic Boulders THE WATERS of the ocean in which our mountains had been formed still covered a part of these Alps when a violent paroxysm of the globe suddenly opened great cavities . . . and ruptured many rocks. . . . \"The waters were carried toward these abysses with extreme violence, falling from the height they were before; they crossed deep valleys and dragged immense quantities of earth, sand, and debris of all kinds of rocks.

The loose rocks lying on the Jura Mountains were torn from the Alps; in their mineral composition they differ from the rock formations of the Jura, showing their alpine origin. Rocks that differ from the formations on which they lie are called \"erratic boulders.\" 1 Horace Benedict de Saussure, Voyages dans les Alpes, I (1779), 151."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"10 REVOLUTION These stone blocks lie on the Jura Mountains at an elevation of 2000 feet above Lake Geneva. Some of them are thousands of cubic feet in size, and Pierre a Martin is over 10,000 cubic feet. They must have been carried across the space now occupied by the lake and lifted to the height where they are found. There are erratic boulders in many places of the world. In the British Isles, on the shore and in the highlands, are enormous quantities of them, transported there across the North Sea from the mountains of Norway. Some force wrested them from those massifs, bore them over the entire expanse that separates Scandinavia from the British Isles, and set them down on the coast and on the hills. From Scandinavia boulders were also carried to Germany and spread over that country, in some places so thickly that it seems as though they had been brought there by masons to build cities. Also, high in the Harz Mountains, in central Germany, lie stones that originated in Norway. From Finland blocks of stone were swept to the Baltic regions and over Poland and lifted onto the Carpathians. Another train of boulders was fanned out from Finland, over the Valdai Hills, over the site of Moscow, and as far as the Don. In North America erratic blocks, broken from the granite of Canada and Labrador, were spread over Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Ohio; they perch on top of ridges and lie on slopes and deep in the valleys. They lie on the coastal plain and on the White Mountains and the Berkshires, sometimes in an unbroken chain; in the Pocono Mountains they balance precariously on the edge of crests. The attentive traveler through the woods wonders at the size of these rocks, brought there and abandoned sometime in the past, frighteningly piled up. Some erratics are enormous. The block near Conway, New Hampshire, is 90 by 40 by 38 feet and weighs about 10,000 tons, the load of a large cargo ship. Equally large is Mohegan Rock, which towers over the town of Mont- ville, in Connecticut. The great flat erratic in Warren County, Ohio, weighs approximately 13,500 tons and covers three quarters of an acre; the Ototoks erratic, thirty miles south of Calgary, Alberta, consists of two pieces of quartzite \"derived from at least 50 miles to the"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"SEA AND LAND CHANGED PLACES 1 1 west,\" of a calculated weight of over 18,000 tons. 2 Blocks of 250 to 300 feet in circumference, however, are small when compared with a mass of chalk stone near Malmo in southern Sweden, which is \"three miles long, one thousand feet wide and from one hundred to two hundred feet in thickness, and which has been transported an indefinite distance. . . .\" It is quarried for commercial purposes. A similar transported slab of chalk is found on the eastern coast of England, \"upon which a village had unwittingly been built.\" 8 In innumerable places on the surface of the earth, as well as on isolated islands in the Atlantic and Pacific and in Antarctica, 4 lie rocks of foreign origin, brought from afar by some great force. Broken off from their parent mountain ridges and coastal cliffs, they were carried down dale and up hill and over land and sea. Sea and Land Changed Places The most renowned naturalist to come from the generation of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars was Georges Cuvier. He was the founder of verte- brate paleontology, or the science of fossil bones, and thus of the science of extinct animals. Studying the finds made in the gypsum formation of Montmartre in Paris and those elsewhere in France and the European continent in general, he came to the conclusion that in the midst of even the oldest strata of marine formations there are other strata replete with animal or plant remains of terrestrial or fresh-water forms; and that among the more recent strata, or those that are nearer the surface, there are also land animals buried under heaps of marine sediment. \"It has frequently happened that lands which have been laid dry, have been again covered by the waters, in consequence either of their being engulfed in the abyss, or of the sea having merely risen over them. . . .

Life, therefore, has often been disturbed on this earth by terrific events. Numberless liv- ing beings have been the victims of these catastrophes; some, which inhabited the dry land, have been swallowed up by inundations; others, which peopled the waters, have been laid dry, the bottom of the sea having been suddenly raised; their very races have been extinguished for ever, and have left no other memorial of their existence than some fragments which the naturalist can scarcely recognize.\" 2 Cuvier was surprised to find that \"life has not always existed upon the globe,\" for there are deep strata which contain no vestiges of living beings. The sea without in- habitants \"would seem to have prepared materials for the mollusca and zoophytes,\" and when they appeared and populated the sea, they deposited their shells and built coral, at first in small numbers, and eventually in vast formations.

Cuvier reviewed the theories of the origin of the world current in his time but found no answer to the question that preoccupied him. He did not know the cause of these vast cataclysms; he only knew that they had occurred. \"Many fruitless efforts'* had been made, and he felt that his search for the causes of the cataclysms was fruitless too. \"These ideas have haunted, I may almost say have tormented me during my researches among fossil bones.\" 7 The Caves of England In 1823, William Buckland, professor of geology at the University of Oxford, published his Reliquiae diluvianae (Relics of the Flood), with the subtitle, Observations on the organic remains contained in caves, fissures, and di- luvial gravel and on other geological phenomena, attest- ing the action of an universal deluge. Buckland was one of the great authorities on geology of the first half of the nineteenth century. In a cave in Kirkdale in Yorkshire, eighty feet above the valley, under a floor covering of stalagmites, he found teeth and bones of elephants, rhinoceroses, hippopotami, horses, deer, tigers (the teeth of which were \"larger than those of the largest lion or Bengal tiger*'), bears, wolves, hyenas, foxes, hares, rab- bits, as well as bones of ravens, pigeons, larks, snipe, and ducks. Many of the animals had died \"before the first set, or milk teeth, had been shed.\" Certain scholars prior to Buckland had their own ex- planation for the provenience of elephant bones in the soil of England, and to them Buckland referred: \"[The idea] which long prevailed, and was considered satisfac- tory by the antiquaries [archaeologists] of the last century, was, that they were the remains of elephants imported by the Roman armies. This idea is also refuted: First, by the anatomical facts of their belonging to an extinct species of this genus; second, by their being usually accompanied by the bones of rhinoceros and hippopotamus, animals which could never have been attached to Roman armies; thirdly, by their being found dispersed over Siberia and f Ibid., p. 242."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"THE CAVES OF ENGLAND 15 North America, in equal or even greater abundance than in those parts of Europe which were subjected to the Roman power.\" 1 It appeared that hippopotamus and reindeer and bison lived side by side at Kirkdale; hippopotamus, reindeer, and mammoth pastured together at Brentford near Lon- don. 2 Reindeer and grizzly bear lived with the hippopot- amus at Cefn in Wales. Lemming and reindeer bones were found together with bones of the cave lion and hyena at Bleadon in Somerset. 8 Hippopotamus, bison, and musk sheep were found together with worked flint in the gravels of the Thames Valley. 4 The remains of reindeer lay with the bones of mammoth and rhinoceros in the cave of Breugue in France, in the same red clay, encased by the same stalagmites. 5 At Arcy, France, also in a cave, bones of the hippopotamus were found with bones of the rein- deer, and with them a worked flint. 6 According to the prophecy of Isaiah (11:6), in mes- sianic times to come the lion and the calf would pasture together. But even prophetic vision has not conceived of a reindeer from snow-covered Lapland and a hippopot- amus from the tropical Congo River living together on the British Isles or in France. Yet they did leave then- bones in the same mud of the same caves, together with bones of other animals, in the strangest assortments. These animal bones were found in gravel and clay to which Buckland gave the name of diluvium. Buckland was concerned \"to establish two important facts, first, that there has been a recent and general in- undation of the globe; and, second, that the animals whose remains are found interred in the wreck of that inundation were natives of high north latitudes.\" The presence of tropical animals in northern Europe \"cannot be solved by supposing them to migrate periodically . . . for in the case of crocodiles and tortoises extensive emi- 1 W.

Buckland says: \"It is equally difficult to imagine that they could have passed their winters in lakes or rivers frozen up with ice.\" If cold-blooded land animals are unable to hide themselves in the ground over the winter, in icy climates their blood would freeze solid: they lack the ability to regulate the temperature of their bodies. Like Cuvier, Buckland was \"nearly certain that if any change of climate has taken place, it took place sud- denly.\" 7 Of the time the catastrophe occurred, which covered with mud and pebbles the bones in the Kirkdale cave, Buckland wrote: \"From the limited quantity of post- diluvian stalactite, as well as from the undecayed con- dition of the bones,\" one must deduce that \"the time elapsed since the introduction of the diluvial mud has not been of excessive length.\" The bones were not yet fossilized; their organic matter was not yet replaced by minerals. Buckland thought that the time elapsed since a diluvial catastrophe could not have exceeded five or six thousand years, the figure adopted also by De Luc, Dolo- mieu, and Cuvier, each of whom presented his own rea- sons. Then the illustrious geologist added these words: \"What [the] cause was, whether a change in the inclina- tion in the earth's axis, or the near approach of a comet, or any other cause or combination of causes purely astro- nomical, is a question the discussion of which is foreign to the object of the present memoir.\" The Aquatic Graveyards The Old Red Sandstone is regarded as one of the old- est strata with signs of extinct life in it.

The stratum of the Old Red Sandstone is twice as thick. This formation presents the spectacle of an upheaval immobilized at a particular moment and petrified for- ever.

The skeletons of these fish lie parallel to the laminae of the strata of the cal- careous slate; they are always entire, and closely packed on one another. . . .

Many of the fishes of this slate at Mansfeld, Eisleben, etc., have a distorted attitude, which has often been assigned to writhing in the agonies of death. ... As these fossil fishes maintain the attitude of the rigid stage immediately succeeding death, it fol- lows that they were buried before putrefaction had com- menced, and apparently in the same bituminous mud, the influx of which had caused their destruction.\" 8 The slory of agony and sudden death and immediate encasing is told by the red sandstone of Scotland; the limestone of Monte Bolca in Lombardy; the bituminous slate of Mansfeld in Thuringia; and also by the coal formation of Saarbrucken on the Saar, \"the most cele- brated deposits of fossil fishes in Europe\"; the calcareous slate of Solenhofen; the blue slate of Glarus; the marl- stone of Oensingen in Switzerland and of Aix-in -Pro- vence, to mention only a few of the better-known sites in Europe.

The British Isles were in danger of being invaded, and Britain's fleet fought at Trafalgar the tyrant who had sprung up from the revolutionary army. After 1815 there was a universal desire for peace and tranquility. The Holy Alliance was organized; Europe sank into reaction, England into a spirit of conservatism. The abortive revolutionary wave of 1830 did not reach the British Isles. No wonder that in the climate of reaction to the erup- tions of revolution and the Napoleonic Wars the theory of uniformity became popular and soon dominant in the natural sciences. According to this theory, the develop- ment of the surface of the globe has been going on through all the ages without any disturbances; the pro- cess of very slow change that we observe at present has been the only process of importance from the beginning.

Darwin built his theory of evolution on Lyell's principle of uniformity. A modern exponent of the theory of evolution, H. F. Osborn, wrote: \"Present continuity implies the improbability of past catastrophism and violence of change, either in the lifeless or in the living world; moreover, we seek to interpret the changes and laws of past time through those which we observe at the present time. This was Darwin's secret, learned from Lyell.\" 1 Lyell built his case with convincing dialectics. Wind and solar heat and rain little by little crumble the rock in the highlands. Rivers carry the detritus to the sea. The land is lowered by this process, which con- tinues for ages, until it turns a vast region into detritus. Then the massive earth, as if in a slow breathing process, every phase of which requires eons, again slowly rises, the bottom of the sea subsides, and the crumbling of the rock begins all over again. The land comes up in an ele- vated plateau; the subsequent action of water and wind cuts furrows, and little by little the highland changes into a range of mountain peaks; more eons, and these heights crumble too, wind and rain carrying them grain by grain into the sea; the shallow sea encroaches on the land, then slowly retreats. No great catastrophes intervene to change the face of the earth. Although sporadic volcanic action occurs, Lyell did not consider it to have an effect in changing the face of the earth comparable in importance to that of rivers, wind, and waves of the sea. What causes the eon-long process of elevation and sub- sidence has not been determined. Naturalists of the eigh- teenth century claimed to have observed a minute gradual change in the level of the Gulf of Bothnia in the Baltic Sea in relation to the coast line. Similar processes in past geological ages must have brought about all the changes on the earth: the majestic mountains that rose and others that were leveled, the seacoast that moved in a slow rhythm back and forth, and the earth mantle that was redistributed by rain and wind.

Since the theory of uniformity is still taught in all places of learning, and to question it is heresy, it is perti- nent to reproduce here some of Lyeil's original state- ments, made in his Principles of Geology; they served as a manifesto or credo for all his followers, whether called uniformists or evolutionists. Lyell wrote: \"It has been truly observed that when we arrange the known fossiliferous formations in chronological order, they constitute a broken and defective series ... we pass, without any intermediate gradations from systems of strata which are horizontal, to other systems which are highly inclined from rocks of peculiar mineral com- position to others which have a character wholly distinct from one assemblage of organic remains to another, in which frequently nearly all the species, and a large part of the genera, are different. These violations of continuity are so common as to constitute in most regions the rule rather than the exception, and they have been considered by many geologists as conclusive in favour of sudden revolutions in the inanimate and animate world.\" 2 Thus he acknowledged that the surface of the globe has the appearance of having been subjected to great and violent sudden changes, but he believed that the record is incomplete and that the major part of the evidence is lost. \"In the solid framework of the globe we have a chronological chain of natural records, many links of which are wanting.\" 3 To make this plausible, Lyell cited an example from human affairs. If a census were taken every year in sixty provinces, changes in the population would appear to be very gradual; but if the census were taken every year in a different province, and in only one, the change in the population of each province between the visits of the census takers at sixty-year intervals would be very great. Lyell maintained that this was the way geo- logical deposits were made. The theory of uniformity, or of gradual changes in the past measured by the extent of changes observed in the present, has, as Lyell admitted, no positive evidence in the incomplete record of the earth's crust; consequently the 2 Sir Charles Lyell, Principles of Geology (12th ed.; 1875), I, 298. 3 Ibid., p. 299."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"24 UNIFORMITY theory, building on argumentum ex silentio, or argument by default, required further analogies. \"Suppose we have discovered two buried cities at the foot of Vesuvius, immediately superimposed upon each other with a great mass of tuff and lava intervening. . . . An antiquary [archaeologist] might possibly be entitled to infer, from the inscriptions on public edifices, that the inhabitants of the inferior and older city were Greeks, and those of the modern town Italians. But he would reason very hastily if he also concluded from these data, that there had been a sudden change from the Greek to the Italian language in Campania. But if he afterwards found three buried cities, one above the other, the in- termediate one, being Roman ... he would then perceive the fallacy of his former opinion, and would begin to suspect that the catastrophes, by which the cities were in- humed, might have no relation whatever to the fluctua- tions in the language of the inhabitants; and that, as the Roman tongue had evidently intervened between the Greek and Italian, so many other dialects may have been spoken in succession, and the passage from the Greek to the Italian may have been very gradual. . . .\" 4 This often-reprinted passage is an unfortunate example, for, in order to prove that there had been no violent changes, Lyell chose to present a picture of violent catas- trophes: the strata are separated by layers of lava. This is also the picture presented in so many geological sur- veys. To use this example as a proof of uniformity is a flight of dialectics. The comparison is followed by an accusation that is all the more vigorous because of the inadequacy of the ex- ample which is called on to substitute for geological evidence. Lyell said: \"It appeared clear that the earlier geologists had not only a scanty acquaintance with existing changes [caused by wind, flowing water, etc.], but were singularly un- conscious of the amount of their ignorance. With the presumption naturally inspired by this unconsciousness, they had no hesitation in deciding at once that time could never enable the existing powers of nature to work out changes of great magnitude, still less such important 4 Ibid., p. 316."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"THE HIPPOPOTAMUS 25 revolutions as those which are brought to light by geol- ogy.\" 6 And he proceeded: \"Never was there a dogma more calculated to foster indolence, and to blunt the edge of curiosity, than this assumption of the discordance between the ancient and existing causes of change. It produced a state of mind unfavourable in the highest degree to the candid reception of the evidence of those minute but incessant alterations which every part of the earth's surface is undergoing.\" 6 At first the tone of this pleading for the then un- orthodox theory of uniformity was defensive; the position was unsupported by sufficient evidence. Then, as though a few analogies to human situations were so strong that they could substitute for the defective record of nature, the tone changed and became uncompromising. \"For this reason all theories are rejected which involve the assumption of sudden and violent catastrophes and revolutions of the whole earth, and its inhabitants theo- ries which are restrained by no reference to existing analogies, and in which a desire is manifested to cut, rather than patiently to untie, the Gordian knot.\" 7 Notwithstanding the strong language employed, the scientific principle which insists that whatever does not occur at the present time has not occurred in the past is a self-imposed limitation. Rather than a principle in sci- ence, it is a statute of faith. And Lyell ended his famous chapter accordingly, with an appeal for faith and with a precept for believers: \"If he [the student] finally believes in the resemblance or identity of the ancient and present systems of ter- restrial changes, he will regard every fact collected re- specting the causes in diurnal action as affording him a key to the interpretation of some mystery in the past.\" 8 The Hippopotamus The hippopotamus inhabits the larger rivers and marshes of Africa; it is not found in Europe or America 5 Ibid., p. 317. 6 Ibid., p. 318. r ibid. 8 Ibid., p. 319."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"26 UNIFORMITY save in zoological gardens where specimens of it wallow most of the time in pools, submerging their huge bodies in muddy water. Next to the elephant it is the largest of the land animals. Bones of hippopotami are found in the soil of Europe as far north as Yorkshire in England. Lyell gave the following explanation for the presence of the hippopotamus in Europe: \"The geologist . . . may freely speculate on the time when herds of hippopotami issued from North African rivers, such as the Nile, and swam northward in summer along the coasts of the Mediterranean, or even occasion- ally visited islands near the shore. Here and there they may have landed to graze or browse, tarrying awhile, and afterwards continuing their course northward.

In northern Wales in the Vale of Clwyd, in numerous caves remains of the hippopotamus lay together with those of the mammoth, the rhinoceros, and the cave lion. In the cave of Cae Gwyn in the Vale of Clwyd, \"during the excavations it became clear that the bones had been greatly disturbed by water action.\" The floor of the cavern was \"covered afterwards by clays and sand containing foreign pebbles. This seemed to prove that the caverns, now 400 feet [above sea level! must have been submerged subsequently to their occupation by the animals and by man. . . .

Three assumptions were made by the exponents of uni- formity: Sometime not long ago the climate of the British Isles was so warm that hippopotami used to visit there in summer; the British Isles subsided so much that caves in the hills became submerged; the land rose again to its present height and all this without any action of a violent nature. Or was it, perchance, a mountain-high wave that crossed the land and poured into the caves and filled them with marine sand and gravel? Or did the ground sub- merge and then emerge again in some paroxysm of na- ture in which the climate also changed? Did the animals run away at the sign of the approaching catastrophe, and did the trespassing sea follow and suffocate them in the caves that were their last refuge and became the place of their burial? Or did the sea sweep them from Africa, throw them in heaps on the British Isles and in other places, and cover them with earth and marine debris? The entrances to some caves were too narrow and the caves themselves too \"shrunk\" (contracted) to have been places of refuge for such huge animals as hippopotami and rhinoceroses. Whichever of these answers or surmises is correct, and whether the hippopotami lived in England or were thrown there by the ocean, whether they sought refuge in caves or the caves are but their graves, their bones on the British Isles, as also on the bottom of the seas surrounding these islands, are signs of some great natural change. Icebergs The theory that rejected the occurrence of catastrophic events in the past was incompatible with the then prevail- ing teaching, which ascribed the distribution of drift (the deposit of rock debris, clay, and organic material that covers continental areas) and of erratic boulders to the action of water in the form of great tidal waves breaking"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"28 UNIFORMITY upon the continents. A slow-moving source, able to do the same work, but in a longer time, had to be found. Lyell assumed that icebergs transferred rocks over the ex- panse of the sea. Icebergs are broken-off parts of glaciers that descend from the mountainous coasts to the sea. Mariners in northern waters have observed icebergs with pieces of rock attached to them. And if we think of the enormity of past geological epochs and multiply the ac- tion of icebergs as carriers of earth and rocks by the time elapsed, we may explain, so argued Lyell, the presence of erratic boulders as well as of till and gravel on land. Erratic boulders are found far from the seashore: Lyell taught that the land was submerged and icebergs traveling over it dropped their load of stones; later the land emerged with the stones on it. Erratic boulders are found on the mountains; therefore, these mountains were under shallow water when icebergs carrying stones from other regions dropped them on the summits. In order to ex- plain in this manner the provenience of erratic boulders, it was necessary to submerge large parts of continents in rather recent times. In some places erratic boulders are distributed in a long string as in the Berkshires. Icebergs could not have acted as intelligent carriers, and Lyell must have felt the weak- ness of his theory on this point. The only alternative known at that time was that of a tidal wave. But Lyeil abhorred catastrophes. He detested them alike in the political life of Europe and in nature. Characteristically, his autobiography begins with this description of the most vivid memory of his early childhood: \"I was four and a half when an event happened which was not likely to be forgotten.\" His family traveled in two carriages a stage and a half from Edinburgh. \"On a nar- row road, with a steep brae above, and an equally precip- itous one below, and no parapet on the roadside, a flock of sheep jumped down into the road, and frightened the horses [of the other carriage]. Away they ran, and with the chaise, man, horses and all, disappeared clean out of sight, over the brae in an instant.\" There was a rescue through the broken pane of glass, a little blood ran, and somebody fainted. 1 It left the first and strongest impres- 1 Charles Lyell, Life, Letters and Journals (1881), I, 2."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"DARWIN IN SOUTH AMERICA 29 sion of his childhood in the memory of the author of the theory of uniformity. Darwin in South America Charles Darwin, who had previously dropped his med- ical studies at Edinburgh University, upon his graduation in theology from Christ College, Cambridge, went in December 1831 as a naturalist on the ship Beagle, which sailed around the world on a five-year surveying expedi- tion. Darwin had with him the newly published volume of LyelFs Principles of Geology that became his bible. On this voyage he wrote his Journal, the second edition of which he dedicated to Lyell. This round-the-world voyage was Darwin's only field- work experience in geology and paleontology, and he drew on it all his life long. He wrote later that these ob- servations served as the \"origin of all my views.\" His ob- servations were made in the Southern Hemisphere and more particularly in South America, a continent that had attracted the attention of naturalists since the explora- tion travels of Alexander von Humboldt (1799-1804). Darwin was impressed by the numerous assemblages of fossils of extinct animals, mostly of much greater size than species now living; these fossils spoke of a flourish- ing fauna that suddenly came to its end in a recent geo- logical age. He wrote under January 9, 1834, in the Journal of his voyage: \"It is impossible to reflect on the changed state of the American continent without the deepest astonishment. Formerly it must have swarmed with great monsters: now we find mere pigmies, compared with the antecedent, allied races.\" He proceeded thus: \"The greater number, if not all, of these extinct quadrupeds lived at a late period, and were the contemporaries of most of the existing sea-shells. Since they lived, no very great change in the form of the land can have taken place. What, then, has exterminated so many species and whole genera? The mind at first is irresistibly hurried into the belief of some great catas- trophe; but thus to destroy animals, both large and small, in Southern Patagonia, in Brazil, on the Cordillera of Peru, in North America up to Behring's [Bering's] Straits, we must shake the entire framework of the globe.\""},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"30 UNIFORMITY No lesser physical event could have brought about this wholesale destruction, not only in the Americas but in the entire world.

Four years before, a teacher in a small-town forestry school, A. Bernard!, had written: \"Once the polar ice reached as far as the southern limit of the district which is still marked by the erratics.\" l A botanist, C. Schimper, had come upon the same idea, probably in- dependently, and coined the term die Eiszeit; he had suc- ceeded in winning Charpentier to the hypothesis. At the edge of the glacier, Agassiz, who came as a skeptic, was himself converted; he became the chief apostle of the new theory. He built a hut on the glacier of Aar and lived in it, so that he could observe the movements of the ice, and thereby attracted the attention of naturalists and curiosity seekers all over Europe. The study of the glaciers in the Alps revealed that glacial ice may move by its own weight a few feet daily; it actually transports stones by carrying and pushing them. l A.

When the glacier melts and retreats, the loose rocks remain where they were at the time of the greatest expansion of the glacier. Agassiz assumed that the erratic boulders on the Jura Mountains had been carried there by ice from the Alps and that the trains of boulders in northern Europe and America had been formed by the gigantic glaciers that, sometime hi the past, covered large parts of these continents. He also concluded that the drift had been brought and left by the ice sheet. Ice scratched the underlying rock with the help of flint and other fragments of hard stone it retained in its grasp; and it polished the rocky floors of slopes and valleys, and excavated the beds of lakes. Agassiz made his conclusions with respect to other parts of the world on the basis of observations limited to Switzerland and its surroundings. He thought that if he could convert two of the leading geologists, Buckland, the author of Reliquiae diluvianae, and Murchison, to the Ice Age theory and thus win their support, the task of gaining recognition for it would become much easier. Agassiz went to the British Isles. In later years, as his widow described it, \"recalling the scientific isolation in which he then stood, opposed as he was to all the prominent geol- ogists of the day, he said: 'Among the older naturalists, only one stood by me: Dr. Buckland, Dean of Westmin- ster. . . . We went first to the Highlands of Scotland, and it is one of the delightful recollections of my life that as we approached the castle of the Duke of Argyll, standing in a valley not unlike some of the Swiss valleys, I said to Buckland: \"Here we shall find our first traces of gla- ciers\"; and, as the stage entered the valley, we actually drove over an ancient terminal moraine, which spanned the opening of the valley.* \" 2 It was a setting for a revela- tion. Agassiz won a follower. A few weeks later, on November 4, 1840, Agassiz read a paper before the Geological Society of London, sum- marizing the excursion in the light of the Ice Age theory, and Buckland, who was then president of the society, followed with a paper of his own on the same subject.

In this paper, hastily prepared, he explained the moraines in Great Britain in the light of Agassiz's teachings. At the November 4 meeting of the society, Murchison \"attempted an opposition\" but, in the words of Agassiz, \"did not produce much effect.\" He added: \"Dr. Buck- land was truly eloquent.\" That same year (1840) Agassiz published his theory in a work entitled Etudes sur les glaciers. He wrote: \"The surface of Europe previously adorned with trop- ical vegetation and populated by herds of huge elephants, enormous hippopotami, and gigantic carnivora, was suddenly buried under a vast mantle of ice, covering plains, lakes, seas, and plateaus. Upon the life and move- ment of a vigorous creation fell the silence of death. Springs vanished, rivers ceased flowing, the rays of the sun, rising upon this frozen shore (if, indeed, they reached it), encountered only the breath of winter from the north and the thunder of crevasses as they opened up across the surface of this icy sea.\" 4 Agassiz regarded the inception and the termination of the Ice Age as catastrophic events. He believed that mammoths in Siberia were suddenly caught in the ice that spread swiftly over the larger part of the globe. He expressed the belief that repeated global catastrophes were accompanied by a fall in the temperature of the globe and its atmosphere, and that glacial ages, of which the earth experienced more than one, were terminated each time by renewed igneous activity in the interior of the earth (eruptions de I'interieur). Thus he maintained that the western Alps had risen very recently, at the end of the last Ice Age, and were younger than the carcasses of mammoths in Siberia, the flesh of which is still edible: these animals, he thought, had been killed at the begin- 3 Ibid., I, 309. 4 Louis Agassiz, Etudes sur les glaciers (1840) p. 314."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"34 ICE ning of the Ice Age. 5 With the renewal of igneous activity, the ice cover melted, great floods ensued, the mountains and lakes in Switzerland and in many other places were formed, and the relief map of the world was generally changed. It is often said that Agassiz added from half a million to a million years to the recent history of the world by inserting the Great Ice Age between the Tertiary, or the age of mammals, and the Recent (comprising the Late Stone Age and historical times). It should be borne in mind, however, that the million-year span for the Ice Age is Lyell's estimate, and he interpreted Agassiz's theory in the spirit of uniformity. 6 The theory of a continental ice cover was acceptable to Lyell. He agreed to it, satisfied to go no farther for his proof than two miles from his home. He realized that floating icebergs could not explain the phenomena of drift and erratic boulders in all places. The only alterna- tive had been the waves of translation, or tidal waves traveling on land, but this was outright catastrophic. Now, with the continental ice theory, he felt he had the correct solution if the catastrophic aspect of the theory, as originally suggested by Agassiz, a follower of Cuvier, was eliminated. It was not yet asked what produced such a cover. On the Russian Plains Soon after the historic meeting at which the Ice Age theory was accepted by the majority of the members of the Geological Society, R. I. Murchison went to Russia, wtfere he had been invited by Czar Nicholas I to make a geological survey of the empire. Out of this survey grew recognition of the Permian System; the Permian, Silurian, and the Devonian, also first recognized by Murchison (Devonian in collaboration with Sedgwick), constitute three of the great divisions in the modern concept of early geological ages. For many months Murchison crossed the latitudes and longitudes of Russia, carefully 5 /bid., pp. 304-29. 6 Lyell borrowed the estimate of a million-year span of time for the Ice Age from J.

He also observed that erratic boulders in the Carpathian Mountains were not of local but of Scandinavian origin. Of the drift, or \"the piles of stone, sand, clay and gravel which are spread out in such enormous masses over the low countries of Russia, Poland, and Germany,\" Murchison expressed the conviction that \"a vast portion, by far the greater part . . . has been transported by aqueous action, consequent of powerful waves of trans- lation and currents occasioned by relative and often paroxysmal changes of the level of sea and land.\" l What- ever may have been the cause of the irruption of the sea, such aqueous debacles \"with the help of ice floes\" produced the drift. \"Seeing that there are no mountains whatever from which a glacier can ever have been propelled in southern Sweden, Finland, or north-eastern Russia, and yet that these regions are powerfully abraded, scored and pol- ished,\" Murchison came to the conclusion that effects so extensively developed over such flat countries must have re- sulted from an irrupting sea that also left behind enor- mous masses of debris and rolled stone. Murchison \"rejected the application of the terrestrial glacier theory of Sweden, Finland, north-eastern Russia, and the whole of northern Germany in short to all the low countries of Europe.\" 2 He agreed that in moun- tainous northern Scandinavia and Lapland arctic glaciers formerly did exist. Ice floes descending from these gla- ciers carried angular broken stones over land covered by sea and dropped them on top of the drift created by the irruption of the sea. Murchison called attention to the fact that \"Siberia is entirely free from erratic blocks, though environed on three sides by high mountains.\" 8 1 R. I.

On the other hand, marine deposits of recent age were found in large areas of European and Asiatic Russia. In the Caspian Sea, which stretches between southern Russia and Persia, live seals related to the seals of the Arctic Ocean. It is con- cluded that the polar sea spread and established a con- nection with the Caspian Sea, and this in Recent time. \"Since the ice withdrew, the Arctic Ocean has spread over large areas of northern Russia and in many places has left marine deposits on the glacial drift as well as on the firmer rocks. The Arctic water spread also over the Obi Basin far to the south and established connections with the Caspian Sea, at which time the progenitors of the present seals of the Caspian rocky islands migrated thither to become stranded when the waters withdrew.\" 6 Ice Age in the Tropics In 1865, Agassiz went to equatorial Brazil, one of the hottest places in the world, where he found all the signs he ascribed to the action of ice. Now even those who had previously agreed with him became distressed. An ice cover hi the tropics, on the very equator? There were drift accumulations, and scratched rocks, and erratic boulders, and fluted valleys, and the smooth surface of tillite (rock formed of consolidated till), so there must have been ice to carry and polish, and the region must have gone through an ice period.

Abundant vestiges of an ice age were likewise found in British Guiana, another of the hottest places on earth. Soon the same word came from equatorial Africa; and what appeared even more strange, the marks there in- dicated not only that equatorial Africa and Madagascar had been under a sheet of ice but that the ice had moved, spreading from the equator toward the higher latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere, or in the wrong direction. Then vestiges of an ice age were discovered in India, and there, too, the ice had moved from the equator, and not merely toward higher latitudes, but uphill, from the lowland up the foothills of the Himalayas. On reconsideration, the vestiges of ice in equatorial regions were ascribed to a different ice age that had taken place not thousands but many millions of years ago. Today the glacial phenomena in the tropics and in the Southern Hemisphere are ascribed, in the main, to the Permian Age, a much earlier period than the recent Ice Age. \"The most remarkable feature of the Permian glacia- tion is its distribution,\" writes C. O. Dunbar of Yale University. \"South America bears evidence of glaciation in Argentina and southeastern Brazil, even within 10 of the equator. In the northern hemisphere, peninsular India, within 20 of the equator, was the chief scene of glacia- tion, with the ice flowing north [or from the tropics to higher latitudes].\" l \"The icecap covered practically all of southern Africa up to at least latitude 22 S and also spread to Madagascar.\" 2 Even if the phenomenon took place very long ago, an ice cover thousands of feet thick in the hottest places of the world is a challenging enigma.

Of its 840,000 square miles of sur- face, over 700,000 are covered with an immense mountain of ice that leaves free only the coastal fringes. The thickness of the ice is measured by listening to the echo that comes from the bedrock when a detonation is set off on top of the ice. It is found to be over six thousand feet thick. \"For a long time it was the belief of many that a large region in the interior of Greenland was free from ice, and was perhaps inhabited. It was in part to solve this problem that Baron [N.A.E.] Nordenskjold set out upon his expedi- tion of 1883.\" 1 He ascended the icecap from Disko Bay (latitude 69) and went eastward for eighteen days across the ice field. \"Rivers were flowing in channels upon the surface like those cut on land . . . only that the pure blue of the ice-walls was, by comparison, infinitely more beau- tiful. These rivers were not, however, perfectly continuous. After flowing for a distance in channels on the surface, they, one and all, plunged with deafening roar into some yawning crevasse, to find their way to the sea through sub- glacial channels. Numerous lakes with shores of ice were also encountered.\" \"On bending down the ear to the ice,'* wrote the explorer, \"we could hear on every side a peculiar sub- terranean hum, proceeding from rivers flowing within the ice; and occasionally a loud single report like that of a cannon gave notice of the formation of a new glacier- cleft. ...

This arctic island reveals how vast continental areas looked in the past. How- ever, it does not explain how ice could have covered British Guiana or Madagascar in the tropics. And what is no less surprising, the northern part of Greenland, according to the concerted opinion of glaciologists, was never glaciated. \"Probably, then as now, an exception was the northernmost part of Greenland; for it seems a rule that the most northerly lands are not, and never were, glaciated,\" writes the polar explorer Vilhjalmur Stefans- son. 3 \"The islands of the Arctic Archipelago,\" writes an- other scientist, \"were never glaciated. Neither was the interior of Alaska.\" 4 \"It is a remarkable fact that no ice mass covered the low lands of northern Siberia any more than those of Alaska,\" wrote James D. Dana, the leading American geologist of the last century. 5 In northern Siberia and on polar islands in the Arctic Ocean spires of rock were observed that would certainly have been broken off if an ice cover had moved over those parts. 6 Bones of Greenland reindeer have been found in south- ern New Jersey and southern France, and bones of Lap- land reindeer in the Crimea. This was explained as due to the invasion of ice and the retreat of northern animals to the south. The hippopotamus was found in France and England and the lion in Alaska. To explain similar occur- rences, an interglacial period was introduced into the scheme: the land was warmed up and the southern animals visited northern latitudes. And since the change from one fauna to another took place repeatedly, four glacial periods with three interglacial were generally counted, though the number of periods is not consistent with all lands or with all investigators.

Greenland presents still another enigma in the preceding formations, those of the Tertiary Age. In the 1860s, O. Heer of Zurich published his classical work on the fossil plants of the Arctic; he identified the plant remains of the northern parts of Greenland as magnolia and fig trees, among other species. 7 Forests of exotic trees and groves of juicy subtropical plants grew in the land that lies deep in the cold Arctic and is immersed yearly in a continuous polar night of six months' duration. Corals of the Polar Regions Spitsbergen in the Arctic Ocean is as far north from Oslo in Norway as Oslo is from Naples. Hcer identified 136 species of fossil plants from Spitsbergen (78 56' north latitude), which he ascribed to the Tertiary Age. Among the plants were pines, firs, spruces, and cypresses, also elms, hazels, and water lilies. At the northernmost tip of Spitsbergen Archipelago, a bed of black and lustrous coal twenty-five to thirty feet thick was found; it is covered with black shale and sand- stone incrusted with fossilized land plants. \"When we remember that this vegetation grew luxuriantly within 8 15' of the North Pole, in a region which is hi darkness for half of the year and is now almost continuously buried under snow and ice, we can realize the difficulty of the problem hi the distribution of climate which these facts present to the geologist.\" l There must have been great forests on Spitsbergen to produce a bed of coal thirty feet thick. And even if Spits- bergen, almost one thousand miles inside the Arctic Circle, for some unknown reason had the warm climate of the French Riviera on the Mediterranean, still these thick forests could not have grown there, because the place is six months in continuous night. The rest of the year the sun stands low over the horizon. 7 O.

Corals grow only in tropical water. In the Mediterranean, in the climate of Egypt or Morocco, it is too cold for them. But they grew in Spitsbergen. Today large formations of coral covered with snow can be seen. It does not solve the problem of their deposition, if they were formed in an older geological epoch. At some time in the remote past corals grew and are still found on the entire fringe of polar North America in Alaska, Canada, and Greenland. 2 In later times (Terti- ary) fig palms bloomed within the Arctic Circle; forests of Sequoia gigantea, the giant tree of California, grew from Bering Strait to north of Labrador. \"It is difficult to imagine any possible conditions of climate in which these plants could grow so near the pole, deprived of sunlight for many months of the year.\" 3 It is usually said that in ages past the climate all over the world was the same, or that a characteristic of the \"warm periods which have formed the major part of geological time was the small temperature difference be- tween equatorial and polar regions.\" To this C. E. P. Brooks, in his book, Climate through the Ages, says: \"So long as the axis of rotation remains in nearly its present position relative to the plane of the earth's orbit around the sun, the outer limit of the atmosphere in tropical re- gions must receive more of the sun's heat than [in] the middle latitudes, and [in] the middle latitudes more than [in] the polar regions; this is an invariable law. ... It is much more difficult to think of a cause which will raise the temperature of polar regions by some 30F. or more, while leaving that of equatorial regions almost un- changed.\" 4 The continent of Antarctica is larger than Europe, European Russia included. It has not a single tree, not a single bush, not a single blade of grass. Very few fungi have been found.

He also found erratic boulders of gran- ite on the slopes of Mount Erebus, a volcano. Then he discovered seven seams of coal, also at about latitude 85. The seams are each between three and seven feet thick. Associated with the coal is sandstone containing conif- erous wood. 6 Antarctica, too, must have had great forests in the past. It often appears that the historian of climate has chosen a field as hard to master as it is to square the circle. It seems sometimes that the history of climate is a collection of unsolved, even unsolvable, questions. Without drastic changes in the position of the terrestrial axis or in the form of the orbit or both, conditions could not have existed in which tropical plants flourished in polar regions. If anyone is not convinced of this, he should try to cul- tivate coral at the North Pole. Whales In the Mountains In bogs covering glacial deposits in Michigan, skel- etons of two whales were discovered. Whales are marine animals. How did they come to Michigan in the post- glacial epoch? Whales do not travel by land. Glaciers do not carry whales, and the ice sheet would not have brought them to the middle of a continent. Besides, the whale bones were found in po-sf-glacial deposits.

To account for the presence of whales in the hills of Vermont and Montreal, at elevations of 500 and 600 feet, requires the lowering of the land to that extent. An- other solution would be for an ocean tide, carrying the whales, to have trespassed upon the land. In either case herculean force would have been required to push moun- tains below sea level or to cause the sea to irrupt, but the latter explanation is clearly catastrophic. Therefore the accepted theory is that the land in the region of Montreal and Vermont was depressed more than 600 feet by the weight of ice and kept in this position for a while after the ice melted. But along the l:oast of Nova Scotia and New England stumps of trees stand in water, telling of once forested country that became submerged.

All in all, British glacial stratigraphic research has encountered exceptional difficulties,\" writes R. F.

The name derives from the presence of a great number of stumps of trees once supposed to have rooted and grown where they are now found. Many of the stumps are in upright positions, and their roots are often interlocked. Today these forests are recognized as having drifted: the roots do not end in small fibers, but are broken off, in most cases one to three feet from the trunk. Bones of sixty species of mammals, besides birds, frogs, and snakes, were found in the forest-bed of Norfolk. Among the mammals were the saber-toothed tiger, huge bear (Ursus horribilis), mammoth, straight-tusked ele- phant, hippopotamus, rhinoceros, bison, and modern horse (Equus caballus) . Two exclusively northern species glutton and musk-ox were found among animals from temperate and tropical latitudes. Of the thirty species of large land animals of the forest-bed, only six still exist in any part of the world all the others are extinct and only three are presently native to the British Isles. 2 Remains of sixty-eight species of plants were obtained from the Norfolk forest-bed; they indicate \"a climate and geographical conditions very similar to those of Norfolk at the present day.\" 3 In view of the sensitivity of plants to thermal conditions, the conclusion might well be drawn that the climate at the time the forest-bed was deposited was not different from the present, which conclusion the fauna, comprising southern as well as northern animals, contradicts. The abundance of animals of so many different species on an island the size of Great Britain caused speculation that at one time it must have been part of a continent and that the Strait of Dover was not then opened.

The finding of warm-climate animals and plants in polar regions, coral and palms in the Arctic Circle, pre- sents these alternatives: either these animals and plants lived there at some time in the past or they were brought there by tidal waves. In some cases the first is true, as where stumps of trees (palms) are found in situ. In other cases the second is true, as where, in one and the same deposit, animals and plants from sea and land, from south and north, are found in a medley. But in both cases one thing is apparent: such changes could not have occurred unless the terrestrial globe veered from its path, either because of a disturbance in the speed of rotation or because of a shift in the astronomical or geographical position of the terrestrial axis. In many cases it can be shown that southern plants grew in the north; either the geographical position of the pole and the latitudes or the inclination of the axis must have changed since then. In many other cases it can be shown that a marine irruption threw into one deposit living creatures from the tropics and from the Arctic; the change must have been sudden, instantaneous. We have both kinds of cases. Consequently there must have been changes in the position of the axis, and they must have been sudden. Cumberland Cavern In 1912 near Cumberland, Maryland, workmen cutting the way for a railroad with dynamite and steam shovel came upon a cavern or a closed fissure with \"a peculiar assemblage of animals.

However, the scientist who explored the cavern for the Smithsonian Institution as soon as it was discovered and who returned there in the following years for closer investigation, J. W. Gidley, contended that the animals were contemporaneous: the position of the bones excluded any other explanation. \"This strange assemblage of fossil remains occurs hopelessly intermingled. . . .\" 2 The bones of the Cumberland cavern were \"for the most part much broken, yet show no sign of being water worn.\" s This would signify that the bones were not car- ried for any length of time by a stream; however, it is quite possible that the animals were dashed against the rocks by an avalanche of water that carried them from far off, broke their bones inside their bodies thus the bones are not water-worn and there smashed together all kinds of animals; then gravel and rocks enclosed them. So also it happened that animals of northern regions wolverine and lemming, the long-tailed shrew, mink, red squirrel, muskrat, porcupine, hare, and elk were heaped together with animals \"suggesting warmer climatic condi- tions\" peccary, crocodilid, and tapir.

Any theory that attempts to explain the presence of animal bones from various climates in one and the same locality by a sequence of glacial and interglacial periods must stumble on the bones of the Cumberland cavern. In Northern China In the village of Choukoutien, near Peiping (Peking) hi northern China, in caverns and in fissures in rocks, a great mass of animal bones was found. \"The most as- tonishing fact was the discovery of this unimaginable wealth of bones of fossil animals\" (Weidenreich). These rich ossiferous deposits occur in association with human skeletal remains. \"As Weidenreich began his studies, other amazing, nearly unexplainable features appeared.\" The fractured bones of seven human individuals were found there. \"A European, a Melanesian, and an Eskimo type lying dead in one close-knit group in a cave, on a Chinese hillside! Weidenreich marvelled.\" l It was assumed that the seven inhabitants of the narrow fissure were murdered because their skulls and bones are fractured. It is possible that these several types of man came together in Choukoutien, since the migrations of ancient man were on a greater scale than is generally thought. But the finders of the conglomerates of bones were per- plexed also by the animal remains: the bones belonged to animals of the tundras, or a cold-wet climate; of steppes and prairies, or dry climate; and of jungles, or warm- moist climate, \"in a strange mixture.\" Mammoths and buffaloes and ostriches and arctic animals left their teeth, horns, claws, and bones in one great melange, and though we have met very similar situations in various places in other parts of the world, the geologists of China regarded then* find as enigmatic. 1R.

The fossils of Choukoutien are found imbedded hi a reddish loam, a mixture of clay and sand, the deposition of which belongs to the same stage as the fossils; this red- dish loam occurs extensively all over northern China. Teilhard and Young concluded that the observed colora- tion \"can neither be a quality inherited from the original material of which the loams are composed, nor a condi- tion brought about by slow chemical processes long after their formation.\" The coloration of this widespread forma- tion being of some extraneous and unexplained origin, the only definite statement concerning it is that some violent change of climate, in itself not the cause of the change of color, occurred \"immediately before the dep- osition of red loams or soon after the deposition.\" 7 Similar observations were made in other parts of the world. Drift, the displacement of which is attributed to the ice cover, is often found tinted a reddish color. R. T. Chamberlin, looking for the origin of this hue, offered the hypothesis that \"granite pebbles were decomposed, the liberated iron staining the drift reddish.\" 8 H.

The Asphalt Pit of La Brea At Rancho La Brea, once on the western outskirts of Los Angeles, and at present hi the immediate neighbor- hood of the luxurious shopping center of that city, bones of extinct animals and of still living species are found in abundance in asphalt mixed with clay and sand. In 1875 some fossil remains of this bituminous deposit were de- scribed for the first time. By then thousands of tons of asphalt had already been removed and shipped to San Francisco for roofing and paving. 1 Beds of petroleum shale (rock of laminated structure formed by the consolidation of clay), ascribed to the Tertiary Age, having in many places a thickness of about two thousand feet, extend from Cape Mendocino in northern California to Los Angeles and beyond, a dis- tance of over four hundred and fifty miles. The asphalt beds of Rancho La Brea are an outcrop of this large bituminous formation. Since 1906 the University of California has been col- lecting the fossils of Rancho La Brea, \"a most remark- able mass of skeletal material.\" When found, these fossils were regarded as representing the fauna of the late Ter- tiary (Pliocene) or early Pleistocene (Ice Age). The Pleistocene strata, fifty to one hundred feet thick, over- lie the Tertiary formations in which the main oil-bearing beds are found. The deposit containing the fossils consists of alluvium, clay, coarse sand, gravel, and asphalt. Most spectacular among the animals found at Rancho La Brea is the saber-toothed tiger (Smilodon), previously unknown elsewhere in the New or Old World, but found since then in other places too.

With this weapon the tiger tore the flesh of his prey. The animal remains are crowded together in the asphalt pit in an unbelievable agglomeration. In the first excava- tion carried on by the University of California \"a bed of bones was encountered in which the number of saber- tooth and wolf skulls together averaged twenty per cubic yard.\" 2 No fewer than seven hundred skulls of the saber- toothed tiger have been recovered. 3 Among other animals unearthed in this pit were bison, horses, camels, sloths, mammoths, mastodons, and also birds, including peacocks. In the time following the discovery of America this re- gion of the coast was rather sparsely populated with animals; early immigrants found only \"semi-starved coyotes and rattlesnakes.\" 4 But when Rancho La Brea received its skeletons \"there lived an amazing assemblage of animals in Western America.\" 5 To explain the presence of these bones in the asphalt, the theory was offered that the animals became entrapped in the tar, sank in it, and were embedded in asphalt when the tar hardened. However, the large number of animals that filled this asphalt bed to overflowing is baffling. Moreover, the fact that the vast majority of them are carnivorous, whereas hi any fauna the majority of an- imals would be herbivorous otherwise the carnivores would have no victims for their daily food requires ex- planation. So it was assumed that some animal, caught in the tar, cried out, thus attracting more of its kind, and these were trapped, too, and at their cries carnivorous animals came, followed by more and more. This explanation might be valid if the state of the bones did not testify that the ensnarement of the animals by the tar happened under violent circumstances. Oil from which the volatile elements have evaporated leaves asphalt, tar, and other bitumens. \"As the greater number of the animals in the Rancho La Brea beds have been en- 2 Ibid. 8 R. S.

Could it be that at this particular spot large herds of wild beasts, mostly carniv- orous, were overwhelmed by falling gravel, tempests, tides, and raining bitumen? 9 Similar finds in asphalt have been unearthed in two other places in California, at Car- pinteria and McKittrick; the depositions were made under comparable circumstances. The plants of the Carpinteria tar pits were found, with one exception, to have been \"members of the Recent flora,\" or of the flora now living 200 miles to the north. 10 Separate bones of a human skeleton were also discov- ered in the asphalt of La Brea. The skull belonged to an Indian of the Ice Age, it is assumed. However, it does not show any deviation from the normal skulls of Indians. The human bones were found in the asphalt under the bones of a vulture of an extinct species. These finds sug- gest that the time when the human body was buried pre- ceded the extinction of that species of vulture or at least coincided with it; in a turmoil of elements the vulture met its death, as did possibly the rest of its kind, with the saber-toothed tiger and many other species and genera.

The state of the bones indicates a long and violent transportation before they reached their final resting place. \"The fossils are in such remarkable profusion in places as to form a veritable pavement of interlacing bones, very few of which are hi their natural articulation with one another,\" says R. S. Lull, director of the Peabody Museum at Yale, in his book on fossils. 1 The profusion of bones in Agate Spring Quarry may be judged by a single block now in the American Museum of Natural History in New York. This block contains about 100 bones to the square foot. There is no way of ex- plaining such an aggregation of fossils as a natural death retreat of animals of various genera. The animals found there were mammals. The most numerous was the small twin-horned rhinoceros (Dicera- therium). There was another extinct animal (Moropus) with a head not unlike that of a horse but with heavy legs and claws like those of a carnivorous animal; and bones of a giant swine that stood six feet high (Dinohyus hollandi) were also unearthed. The Carnegie Museum, which likewise excavated in Agate Spring Quarry, in a space of 1350 square feet found 164,000 bones or about 820 skeletons. A mammal skeleton averages 200 bones. This area represents only one twentieth of the fossil bed in the quarry, suggesting to Lull that the entire area would yield about 16,400 skeletons of the twin-horned rhinoceros, 500 skeletons of the clawed horse, and 100 skeletons of the giant swine. A few miles to the east, in another quarry, were found skeletons of an animal which, because of its similarity to two extant species, is called a gazelle camel (Stenomylus). A herd of these animals was destroyed in a disaster. As in Agate Spring Quarry, the fossil bones were deposited in sand transported by water. The transportation was in a violent cataract of water, sand, and gravel, that left marks on the bones.

In the United States, Big Bone Lick, Kentucky, twenty miles south of Cincinnati, contained the bones of one hundred masto- dons, besides many other extinct animals. President Jefferson gathered there his famous collection of fossils. In San Pedro Valley, California, skeletons of the masto- don are found standing upright, in the posture in which they died, mired in gravel, ash, and sand.

To the surprise of many sci- entists, it was found that mountains have traveled, since older formations have been pushed over on top of younger ones. Chief Mountain hi Montana is a massif standing sev- eral thousand feet above the Great Plains. It \"has been thrust bodily upon the much younger strata of the Great Plains, and then driven over them eastward, for a distance of at least eight miles. Indeed, the thrust may have been several times eight miles,\" writes Daly. 1 \"By similar thrusting, the whole Rocky Mountain Front, for hundreds of miles, has been pushed up and then out, many miles over the plains.\" 2 Such titanic displacements of mountains have been found in many places on the earth. The displacement of the Alps is especially extensive. \"During the building of the Alps gigantic slabs of rock, thousands of feet thick, hundreds of miles long, and tens l Daly, Our Mobile Earth, pp. 228-29. a Ibid., p. 231. 65"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"66 MOUNTAINS AND RIFTS of miles wide, were thrust up and then over, relatively to the rocks beneath.

In a sense the Alps used to be on the present site of northern Italy.\" 8 Mont Blanc was moved from its place_and the Matterhorn was overturned. Those portions of the Alps that surround the valley of the Linth, in the canton of Glarus in Switzerland, have lower parts of Tertiary formations or of the age of mam- mals; their upper parts are Permian (preceding the age of reptiles) and Jurassic (of the age of reptiles). This impels to one of two conclusions: either the division of rocks into sequences based on the fossils they contain is fallacious, or the old mountains were moved bodily and set on the shoulders of more recent formations. The latter conclusion is chosen; and if De Saussure's notion of the sea sweeping over the Alps appeared fantastic, the idea of mountains traveling considerable distances must sound even more fantastic, unless we know of a physical cause that could have brought it about. But even the ye^ cftu^e of mountain building itself is obscure. -\"*\" \"The problem of mountain-making is a vexing one: Many of them [mountains] are composed of tangentially compressed and overthrust rocks that indicate scores of miles of circumferential shortening in the Earth's crust. Radial shrinkage is woefully inadequate to cause the observed amount of horizontal compression. Therein lies the real perplexity of the problem of mountain- making. Geologists have not yet found a satisfactory escape from this dilemma,\" says F. K. Mather of Harvard University. 4 The origin of the mountains is not explained; and still less is their thrust or shift across valleys and over other mountains. The Alps were shoved a hundred miles to the north. Chief Mountain in Montana traveled across the plains and climbed the slope of another mountain and 8 Ibid., pp. 232-33. 4 F. K. Mather, reviewing O.

All of the Glacier National Park in Montana and all the Rocky Mountain area up to the Yellowhead Pass in Alberta\" moved for many miles. 5 The mountains of western Scotland shifted from their places. The entire length of the Norwegian mountains showed a similar overthrust. What could have caused these moun- tains to travel across valley and uphill with their masses of granite weighing billions of tons? No force acting from inside the earth, pulling inward or pushing outward, could have created these overthrusts. Only twisting could have produced them. It could hardly have occurred if the rotation and revolution of our planet had never been disturbed. In the Alps, caverns with human artifacts of stone and bone dating from the Pleistocene (Ice Age) have been found at remarkably high altitudes. During the Ice Age the slopes and valleys of the Alps, more than other parts of the continent, must have been covered by glaciers; today in central Europe there are great glaciers only hi the Alps. The presence of men at high altitudes during the Pleistocene or Paleolithic (rude stone) Age seems baffling. The cavern of Wildkirchli, near the top of Ebenalp, is 4900 feet above sea level. It was occupied by man sometime during the Pleistocene. \"Even more remarkable, in respect to altitude, is the cavern of Drachenloch at a height of 2445 meters [8028 feet],'* near the top of Dra- chenberg, south of Ragaz. This is a steep, snow-covered massif. \"Both of these stations are in the very heart of the Alpine field of glaciation.\" 6 A continental ice sheet thousands of feet thick filled the entire valley between the Alps and the Jura, where now Lake Geneva lies, to the height of the erratic boulders torn from the Alps and placed on the Jura Mountains. In the same geological epoch, between two advances of the ice cover, during an interglacial intermission, human beings must have occupied caverns 8000 feet above sea level. No satisfactory explanation for such location of Stone Age man has ever been offered. 5 George McCready Price, Common-sense Geology, p. 120.

This was evidence that the Himalayas had risen from beneath the sea. At some time in the past azure waters of the ocean streamed over Mount Everest, carrying fish, crabs, and mollusks, and marine animals looked down to where now we look up and where man, after many unsuccessful efforts, has until now succeeded only once in putting his feet. Until recently it was assumed that the Himalayas rose from the bottom of the sea to their present height tens or perhaps hundreds of millions of years ago. Such a long period of time, so long ago, was enough even for the Himalayas to have risen to their present height. Do we not, when we tell young listeners a story about giants and monsters, begin with: \"Once upon a time, long, long ago . . .\"? And the giants are no longer threatening and the monsters are no longer real. According to the general geological scheme, five hun- dred million years ago the first forms of life appeared on earth; two hundred million years ago life developed into reptilian forms that dominated the scene, achieving gi- gantic size. The huge reptiles died out seventy million years ago, and mammals occupied the earth they be- longed to the Tertiary. According to this scheme, the last mountain uplifts took place at the end of the Tertiary, during the Pliocene; this period lasted until a million years ago, when the Quaternary period, the age of man, began. The Quaternary is also the time of the Ice Age or the Pleistocene the Paleolithic or Old Stone Age; and the very end of the Quaternary, since the end of the Ice Age, is called Recent time: the Neolithic (Late, or polished, Stone), Bronze, and Iron cultures. Since the appearance of man on earth, or since the beginning of the Ice Age, there have been no uplifts on any substantial scale. In other words, we have been told, the profile of the earth with its mountains and oceans was already established when man first appeared. In the last few decades, however, numerous facts have emerged from mountains and valleys that tell a different story. In Kashmir, Helmut de Terra discovered sedi- mentary deposits of an ancient sea bottom that was ele- vated at places to an altitude of 5000 feet or more and tilted at an angle of as much as 40; the basin was"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"70 MOUNTAINS AND RIFTS dragged up by the rise of the mountain. But this was entirely unexpected: \"These deposits contain paleolithic fossils.\" And this, according to Arnold Heim, Swiss geolo- gist, would make it plausible that the mountain passes in the Himalayas may have risen, in the age of man, three thousand feet or more, \"however fantastic changes so extensive may seem to a modern geologist.\" 1 Studies on the Ice Age in India and Associated Human Cultures, published in 1939 by De Terra, working for the Carnegie Institution, with the assistance of Professor T. T. Paterson of Harvard University, is one long argument and demonstration that the Himalayas were arising during the Glacial Age and reached their present heights only after the end of the Glacial Age, and actually in historical times. From other mountain ridges came similar reports. De Terra divided the Ice Age of the Kashmir slopes of the Himalayas into Lower Pleistocene (embracing the first glacial and interglacial stages). Middle Pleistocene (the second, major glaciation and the following inter- glacial), and Upper Pleistocene (comprising the last two glaciations and an interglacial stage). \"The scenery which this region presented at the begin- ning of the Pleistocene must have differed greatly from that of our time. . . . The Kashmir valley was less ele- vated, and its southern rampart, the Pir Panjal, lacked that Alpine grandeur that enchants the traveler today. . . .\" Then various formation groups moved \"both horizontally and vertically, resulting in a southward displacement of older rocks upon foreland sediments, accompanied by up- lift of the mobile belt.\" 2 \"The main Himalayas suffered sharp uplift in conse- quence of which the Kashmir lake beds were compressed and dragged upward on the slope of the most mobile range. . . .

It has been repeatedly admitted by various authorities quoted subsequently hi this book that the end of the glacial epoch may have been almost contemporaneous with the time of the rise of the great cultures of antiquity, of Egypt and Sumeria and, it follows, also of India and China. The Stone Age in some regions could have been contemporaneous with the Bronze Age in others. Even now there are numerous tribes in Africa, Australia, and Tierra del Fuego, the southern tip of the Americas, still living in the Stone Age, and many other regions of the modern world would have remained in the Stone Age had it not been for the im- portation of iron from more advanced regions. The aborigines of Tasmania never got so far as to produce a polished neolithic stone implement, and in fact barely entered the crudest stone age. This large island south of Australia was discovered in 1642 by Abel Tasman; the last Tasmanian died in exile in 1876, and the race became extinct. The more recent uplifts in the Himalayas took place also in the age of modern man. \"The postglacial terrace record suggests that there was at least one prominent postglacial advance [of ice],\" and this, in the eyes of De Terra and Paterson, is indicative of a diastrophic movement of the mountains. \"We must be emphatic on one particular fea- 4 Ibid., p. 222."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"72 MOUNTAINS AND RIFTS ture namely, the dependence of Pleistocene glaciation on the diastrophic character of a mobile mountain belt. This relationship, we feel, has not been sufficiently recog- nized in other glaciated regions, such as Central Asia and the Alps, where similar if not identical conditions are found.\" 5 It had been generally assumed that loess thin wind- blown dust that is built into clays is a product of a glacial age. However, in the Himalayas De Terra reported finding neolithic, or polished stone, implements in loess and commented: \"Of importance for us is the fact that loess formation was not restricted to the glacial age but that it continued . . . into postglacial times.\" In China and in Europe, too, the presence of polished stone artifacts in loess prompted a similar revision. The neolithic stage that began, according to the accepted scheme, at the end of the Ice Age, still persisted in Europe and in many other places at the time when, in the centers of civilization, the Bronze Age was already flourishing. R. Finsterwalder, exploring the Nanga Parbat massif in the western Himalayas (26,660 feet high), dated the Himalayan glaciation as post-glacial; in other words, the expansion of the glaciers in the Himalayas took place much closer to our time than had been previously as- sumed. Great uplifts of the Himalayas took place in part after the time designated as the Ice Age, or only a few thousand years ago. 6 Heim, investigating the mountain ranges of western China, adjacent to Tibet and east to the Himalayas, came to the conclusion (1930) that they had been elevated since the glacial age. 7 The great massif of the Himalayas rose to its present height in the age of modern, actually historical, man. \"The highest mountains in the world are also the young- est.\" 8 With their topmost peaks the mountains have shat- tered the entire scheme of the geology of the \"long, long ago.\" 5 Ibid., p. 223. 8 R.

In the nineteenth century their unusually rich fossil beds drew the attention of sci- entists. Animal bones of species and genera, living and extinct, were found there in most amazing profusion. Some of the animals looked as though nature had con- ducted an abortive experiment with them and had dis- carded the species as not fit for life. The carapace of a tortoise twenty feet long was found there; how could such an animal have moved on hilly terrain? 1 The Elephas ganesa, an elephant species found in the Siwalik Hills, had tusks about fourteen feet long and over three feet in circumference. One author says of them: \"It is a mystery how these animals ever carried them, owing to their enormous size and leverage.\" 2 The Siwalik fossil beds are stocked with animals of so many and such varied species that the animal world of today seems impoverished by comparison. It looks as though all these animals invaded the world at one time: \"This sudden bursting on the stage of such a varied pop- ulation of herbivores, carnivores, rodents and of primates, the highest order of the mammals, must be regarded as a most remarkable instance of rapid evolution of species,\" writes D.

The older geologists thought that the Siwalik deposits were alluvial in their nature, that they were debris carried down by the torrential Himalayan streams. But it was realized that this explanation \"does not appear to be ten- able on the ground of the remarkable homogeneity that the deposits possess\" and a \"uniformity of lithologic com- position\" in a multitude of isolated basins, at considerable distances from one another. 5 There must have been some agent that carried these animals and deposited them at the feet of the Himalayas, and, after the passage of a geo- logical age, repeated the performance for in the Siwalik Hills there are animals of more than one age, and signs of more than one destruction.

Tiahuanacu In the Andes In the Andes, at 1 6 '22' south latitude, a megalithic city was found at an elevation of 12,500 feet, in a region where corn will not ripen. The term \"megalithic\" fits the dead city only in regard to the great size of the stones in its walls, some of which are flattened and joined with pre- cision. It is situated on the Altiplano, the elevated plain between the Western and Eastern Cordilleras, not far from Lake Titicaca, the largest lake in South America and the highest navigable lake hi the world, on the border of Bolivia and Peru. \"There is a mystery still unsolved on the plateau of Lake Titicaca, which, if stones could speak, would reveal a story of deepest interest. Much of the difficulty in the solution of this mystery is caused by the nature of the region, in the present day, where the enigma still defies explanation.\" So wrote Sir Clemens Markham in 1910. 1 \"Such a region is only capable of sustaining a scanty popu- lation of hardy mountaineers and laborers. The mystery consists in the existence of ruins of a great city at the southern side of the lake, the builders being entirely unknown. The city covered a large area, built by highly skilled masons, and with the use of enormous stones.\" 2 When the author of the quoted passages posed his ques- tion to the scholarly world, Leonard Darwin, then presi- dent of the Royal Geographical Society, offered the surmise that the mountain had risen considerably after the city had been built.

Under the asumption that the Andes were once some two or three thousand feet lower than they are now, \"maize would then ripen in the basin of Lake Titicaca, and the site of the ruins of Tiahuanacu could support the necessary population. If the megalithic builders were living under these conditions, the problem is solved. If this is geologically impossible, the mystery remains unexplained.\" 3 Several years ago another authority, A. Posnansky, wrote in similar vein: \"At the present time, the plateau of the Andes is inhospitable and almost sterile. With the present climate, it would not have been suitable in any period as the asylum for great human masses\" of the \"most important prehistoric center of the world.\" 4 \"End- less agricultural terraces\" of the people who lived in this region in pre-Inca days can still be recognized. \"Today this region is at a very great height above sea level.

The conservative view among evolutionists and geolo- gists is that mountain making is a slow process, observable in minute changes, and that because it is a continuous process there never could have been spontaneous upliftings on a large scale. In the case of Tiahuanacu, however, the change in altitude apparently occurred after the city was built, and this could not have been the result of a slow process that required hundreds of thousands of years to produce a visible alteration. Once Tiahuanacu was at the water's edge; then Lake Titicaca was ninety feet higher, as its old sjtrand line dis- closes.

At some other time point a city was built there and terraces were laid out on the elevation around it; then in another disturbance the mountains were thrust up and the area became un- inhabitable. The barrier of the Cordilleras that separates the Alti- plano from the valley to the east was torn apart and gigantic blocks were thrown into the chasm. Lyell, com- bating the idea of a universal flood, offered the theory that the bursting of the Sierra barrier opened the way for a large lake on the Altiplano, which cascaded down into the valley and caused the aborigines to create the myth of a universal flood. 10 Not so long ago an explanation of the mystery of Lake Titicaca and of the fortress Tiahuanacu on its shore was put forward in the light of Horbiger's theory: A moon circled very close to the earth, pulling the waters of the oceans toward the equator; by its gravitational pull, the moon held, day and night, the water of the ocean at the altitude of Tiahuanacu: \"The level of the ocean must 6 H.

All this happened millions of years before our moon was caught by the earth, and thus the ruins of the megalithic city Tiahuanacu are mil- lions of years old, that is, the city must have been built long \"before the Flood.\" This theory is bizarre. The geological record indicates a late elevation of the Andes, and the time of its origin is brought ever closer to our time. Archaeological and radio- carbon analyses indicate that the age of the Andean cul- ture and of the city is not much older than four thousand years. 12 Not only the \"built before the Flood'* theory collapses; so does the belief that the last elevation of the Andes was in the Tertiary, or more than a million years ago. Sometime in the remote past the Altiplano was at or below sea level, so that originally its lakes were part of a sea gulf. The last upheaval, however, took place in an early historical period, after the city of Tiahuanacu had been built; the lakes were dragged up, and the Altiplano and the entire chain of the Andes rose to their present height. The ancient stronghold of Ollantaytambo in Peru is built on top of an elevation; it is constructed of blocks of stone twelve to eighteen feet high. \"These Cyclopean stones were hewn from the quarry seven miles away. . . . How the stones were carried down to the river in the valley, shipped on rafts, and carried up to the site of the fortress remains a mystery archaeologists cannot solve.\" 13 Another fortress or monastery, Ollantayparubo, in the Urubamba Valley in Peru, northwest of Lake Titicaca, \"perches upon a tiny plateau some 13,000 feet above sea-level, in an uninhabitable region of precipices, chasms, and gorges.\" It is built of red porphyry blocks. The blocks must have been brought \"from a considerable distance 11 H. S. Bellamy, Built before the Flood: The Problem of the Tiahuanacu Ruins (1947), p. 14 12 F. C.

However, definite proof in this connection is lacking, and changes in topography must be deduced from abandoned terraces, from mollusks of the dried-up lakes, from tilted shorelines, and from other similar indications. Charles Darwin, on his travels in South America in 1834-35, was impressed by the raised beaches at Val- paraiso, Chile, at the foot of the Andes. He found that the former surf line was at an altitude of 1300 feet. He was impressed even more by the fact that the sea shells found at this altitude were still undecayed, to him a clear indi- cation that the land had risen 1300 feet from the Pacific Ocean in a very recent period, \"within the period during which upraised shells remained undecayed on the sur- face.*' 15 And since only a few intermediary surf lines can be detected, the elevation could not have proceeded little by little. Darwin also observed that \"the excessively disturbed condition of the strata in the Cordillera, so far from indi- cating single periods of extreme violence, presents insu- perable difficulties, except on the admission that the masses of once liquefied rocks of the axes were repeatedly in- jected with intervals sufficiently long for their successive cooling and consolidation.\" 18 At present it is the common view that the Andes were created, not so much by compression of the strata, as by magma, or molten rock, invading the strata and lifting them. The Andes also abound in volcanoes, some exceed- ingly high and enormously large. The foothills of the Andes hide numerous deserted towns and abandoned terraces, monuments to a vanished civilization. The terraces that go up the slopes of the Andes, and reach the eternal snow line and continue under the snow to some unidentified altitude prove that 14 Bellamy, Built before the Flood, p. 63.

I saw the spot where a cluster of fine trees once waved their branches on the shores of the Atlantic, when that ocean now driven back 700 miles came to the foot of the Andes. I saw that they had sprung from a volcanic soil which had been raised above the level of the sea, and that subsequently this dry land, with its upright trees, had been let down into the depths of the ocean. In these depths, the formerly dry land was covered by sedimentary beds, and these again by enormous streams of submarine lava one such mass at- taining the thickness of a thousand feet; and these deluges of molten stone and aqueous deposits five times alternately had been spread out. The ocean which received such thick masses must have been profoundly deep; but again the subterranean forces exerted themselves, and now I beheld the bed of that ocean, forming a chain of moun- tains more than seven thousand feet in height. . . .

The Rift begins in the valley of the Orontes River in Syria; at Baalbek it goes over to the Litani River Valley, then to Lake Huleh in Palestine; along the Jordan River to the Sea of Galilee, called also Gennesaret or the Sea of Tiberias, which lies in a depression below the level of the Mediterranean from there to the Dead Sea, the deepest depression on earth, between the Judean and Moabite mountainous plateaus that were torn apart; then 4 Ibid., pp. 701-3. 1 J.

It was recognized that a horizontal force of one kind or another had been the cause of this rift valley. \"The simplest and earliest thought was that Africa had been pulled apart.\" 2 However, another school of geologists questioned whether the Rift could not have been pro- duced under horizontal pressure, which forced the margins of the rift valley up and the valley strip down. After a long debate the consensus restated the view expressed by Hduard Suess, a prominent geologist at the turn of the century: \"The opening ot fissures of such magnitude can be explained only by the action of a tension, directed perpendicularly to the trend of the split, the tension being relieved in the instant of bursting, that is, of opening of the fissure.\" 3 He observed also that immense floods of lava gushed out of the earth along the Rift and a most vigorous volcanic action took place. Suess brought to geology the now generally accepted concept of Gond- wana land, a continental mass that occupied the larger portion of the Indian Ocean, and that in a relatively recent subsidence was torn apart and drowned. The subsidence of the Gondwana continent could have caused a strain on western Asia and Africa, and under this tension the land must have been rent and the Great Rift formed. Gregory wrote: \"The nearest approach in size [to the Rift] can probably be found on the moon, whose clefts or nils no doubt represent long, steeply walled valleys and present to us much the same aspects as this East African 2B Willis, East African Plateaus and Rtft Valleys (W6). p 1. a Ibid , p 13.

Not the least interesting of the points raised by the African-Red Sea-Jordan depression is the possibility that it may explain the nature of those lunar clefts which have so long been a puzzle to astronomers.\" 4 The Rift was produced by tension; hence the rifts on the moon were also caused by tension. Gregory followed Suess in linking the Great Rift Valley with \"the mountain chains due to the last great uplift of fold mountains\" in Europe, Asia, and the Americas. Thus the time of the last uplift, if established, would also clarify the time when Africa suffered the Great Rift. It is probable, too, that the Rift began in one great tension and increased in the next. Gregory concluded: \"This wide-spread valley system is obviously not the result of some local fracture. Its length is about one-sixth of the circumference of the Earth. It must have some world- wide cause, the first promising clue to which is the date of its formation.\" 6 Although Gregory thought that the Rift first came into being at an early epoch because of marine fossils found in it he also saw signs of great earth movements along the Rift \"at a recent date.\" \"Some of the fault-scarps are so bare and sharp that they must be of very recent date. This continuation of earth-movements into the human period is one of the most striking features of the district.\" Gregory found also that human memory retained recol- lection of the upheaval. \"All along the line the natives have traditions of great changes in the structure of the country.\" 6 The globe was in tension and its crust cracked along a meridian for most of the length of the African continent. The cause may have been the subsidence of the Indian Ocean, or both tension in Africa and subsidence in the Indian Ocean could have a common cause. The mountain ridge on the floor of the Atlantic Ocean may have been produced by the same cause; and the time of the rupture and faulting must have been coincident with one of the periods of mountain formation in Europe and Asia.

What is now the desert of Sahara was an open grassland or steppe in earlier days. Drawings on rock of herds of cattle, made by early dwellers in this region, were discovered by Barth in 1850. Since then many more drawings have been found. The animals depicted no longer inhabit these regions, and many are generally extinct. It is asserted that the Sahara once had a large human population that lived in vast green forests and on fat pasture lands. Neolithic imple- ments, vessels and weapons made of polished stone, were found close to the drawings. Such drawings and imple- ments were discovered hi the eastern as well as the west- ern Sahara. Men lived in these \"densely populated\" (Flint) regions and cattle pastured where today enormous expanses of sand stretch for thousands of miles. Several theories have been offered to explain the prodi- gious quantity of sand in the Sahara. \"The theory of marine origin is now no longer tenable.\" 1 The sand, it was found, is of recent origin.

How long ago was it that conditions in the Sahara were suitable for human occupation? Movers, the noted Orien- talist of the last century, author of a large work on the Phoenicians, decided that the drawings in the Sahara were the work of the Phoenicians. 2 It was likewise observed that on the drawings discovered by Earth the cattle wore discs between their horns, just as in Egyptian drawings. 8 Also, the Egyptian god Set was found pictured on the rocks. And there are rock paintings of war chariots drawn by horses \"in an area where these animals could not survive two days without extraordinary precautions.\" 4 The extinct animals in the drawings suggest that these pictures were made sometime during the Ice Age; but the Egyptian motifs in the very same drawings suggest that they were made in historical times. The conflict between the historical and the paleonto- logical evidence, and of both of them with the geological evidence, is resolved if one or more catastrophes inter- vened. It appears that a large part of the region was occupied by an inland lake, or vast marsh, known to the ancients as Lake Triton. In a stupendous catastrophe the lake emptied itself into the Atlantic, and the sand on its bottom and shores was left behind, forming a desert when tectonic movements sealed oif the springs that fed the lake.

Berthelot says: \"It is possible that Stone Age man witnessed in Africa three notable events: the sinking of the Spanish- Atlas chain that opened the Strait of Gibraltar and created a junction between the Mediterranean Sea and the Ocean; the collapse that cut off the Canary Islands from the African continent; the opening of the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb, separating Arabia 2 L.

But at a later date people of advanced culture, contemporary with pharaonic Egypt, lived in communities, pastured their cattle, and left their tools and drawings there. Then in an upheaval, of which many traditions persist in classical literature, the Atlas Mountains were torn apart, the great lake was emptied, and the watery region became the great and awesome desert the Sahara. Arabia There is a \"certainty beyond challenge that when the icecap of the last Glacial period covered a large part of the northern hemisphere, at least three great rivers flowed from west to east across the whole width of the [Arabian] Peninsula.\" So wrote Philby in his book Arabia. 1 There was also a large lake in Arabia that disappeared in some geological or climatal change. 2 At present, from Palmyra to Mecca and beyond, the Arabian Peninsula is a waterless desert, interspersed with volcanoes active not so long ago, but now extinct, the last eruption having taken place in 1253. 8 There were also, sometime in the past, numerous geysers all likewise ex- tinct now. Twenty-eight fields of burned and broken stones, called harras, are found in Arabia, mostly in the western half of the great desert. Some single fields are one hundred miles in diameter and occupy an area of six or seven thousand square miles, stone lying close to stone, so densely packed that passage through the field is almost impossible. 4 The stones are sharp-edged and scorched 8 A.

No volcanic eruption could have cast scorched stones over fields as large as the harras; neither would the stones from volcanoes have been so evenly spread. The absence, in most cases, of lava the stones lie free also speaks against a volcanic origin of the stones. It appears that the blackened and broken stones of the harras are trains of meteorites, scorched in their passage through the atmosphere, that broke during their fall, as bolides do, or on reaching the ground. Billions of stones in a single harra indicate that the trains of meteorites were very large and can be classed as comets. Despite alternate exposure to the thermal action of the hot desert sun and the cool desert night, the sharp edges of the stones have been preserved, which shows that they fell in a not too distant period of time. Following the procedure adopted in this book, literary references to the harras of Arabia in ancient Hebrew and Arabic literatures will not be dealt with here. Meteorites that fall on the earth are of two kinds. One consists of iron with an admixture of nickel; by means of this admixture and the characteristic pattern seen in the cut surface of such stones, their meteoric origin can be easily established. The other group, probably larger than the first, does not differ in its composition from the rocks of the earth and cannot be distinguished unless the fall has been observed, or, as in the case of the stones of the harras, their scorched and broken condition, together with their occurrence in large fields, speak for their extra- terrestrial origin. Larger bodies than the stones of the harras fell on Arabia, too. In Wobar in the desert there is a meteoric crater with meteoric iron and silica glass spread around it. 5 Large rivers that disappeared, numerous volcanoes that burned and were extinguished, blackened stones that fell in areas each of them a hundred times larger than any volcanic eruption could have covered, and meteoric iron spread around a large crater all of these bespeak great upheavals in nature in recent as well as earlier ages, to 5 R.

In the southern part of the great Arabian desert, an- cient ruins, almost entirely obliterated by time and the elements, and vestiges of cultivation are silent witnesses of the time when the land there was hospitable and fruit- ful; it was as copiously watered and luxuriously forested as India on the same latitude. Orchards covered Hadhra- maut and Aden. It was a land of plenty, paradise on earth, but following a sudden catastrophe, Arabia Felix turned to a barren land. Arabia Petraea, the western part of the desert, is a dusty rock of lava that is broken by the Great Rift, with the Dead Sea, an inner lake, on its bot- tom. Sulphurous springs flow into it, and asphalt rises from its floor and floats on it. Like the Sahara and Arabian deserts, other great deserts of the world disclose the fact that they were inhabited and cultivated sometime in the past. On the Tibetan plateau and in the Gobi Desert remains of early prosperous civi- lizations were found with occasional ruins surviving from those times when the great barren tracts were cultivated. In the Gobi Desert, as in the Arabian and Sahara deserts, the impression is gained that in a tectonic disturbance the subterranean water dropped to a great depth, the sources became sealed, and the rivers dried up completely. Some changes in ground structure or in ground currents also affect the clouds, which pass over such lands without un- burdening themselves. The Carolina Bays Peculiar elliptical depressions, or \"oval craters,\" locally called \"bays,\" are thickly scattered over the Carolina coast of the United States and more sparsely over the entire Atlantic coastal plain from southern New Jersey to northeastern Florida. These marshy depressions are numbered in the tens of thousands and, according to the latest estimate, their number may reach half a million. 1 i Douglas Johnson, The Origin of the Carolina Bays (1942): W F.

A remarkable feature of these depressions is their parallel- ism: the long axis of each of them extends from north- west to southeast, and the precision of the parallelism is \"striking.\" Around the bays are rims of earth, invariably elevated at the southeastern end. These oval depressions may be seen especially well in aerial photographs. Any theory as to their origin must explain their form, the ellipticity of which increases with the size of the bays; their parallel alignment; and the elevated rims at their southeastern ends. In 1933 a theory was presented by Melton and Schriever of the University of Oklahoma, according to which the bays are scars left by a \"meteoric shower or colliding comet.\" 2 Since then the majority of the authors who have dealt with the problem have accepted this view, and it has found its way into textbooks as the usual in- terpretation. 8 The authors of the theory stress the fact that, \"Since the origin of the bays apparently cannot be explained by the well-known types of geological activity, an extraordinary process must be found. Such a process is suggested by the elliptical shape, the parallel alinement, and the systematic arrangement of elevated rims.\" The comet must have struck from the northwest. \"If the cosmic masses approached this region from the north- west, the major axes would have the desired alinement.\" The time when the catastrophe took place was estimated as sometime during the Ice Age. The bays are \"filled to a considerable extent by the deposition of sand and silt, a process which doubtless occurred while the region was covered by the sea during the terrace-forming marine in- vasion of the Pleistocene [glacial] period.\" 4 But the pos- sibility was also envisaged that \"the collision took place\" through \"the shallow ocean water during the marine in- vasion.\" The swarm of meteorites must have been large enough to hit an area from Florida to New Jersey.

Some of the bays, it is assumed, are on the bottom of the ocean. It was also stressed that \"a very large number of meteorites have been discovered in the southern Appalachian region, in Virginia, North and South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Kentucky, and Tennessee.\" 6 The Bottom of the Atlantic In the fall of 1949, Professor M. Ewing of Columbia University published a report on an expedition to the Atlantic Ocean. Explorations were carried on especially in the region about the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the mountain- ous chain that runs from north to south, following the general outlines of the ocean. The Ridge, as well as the ocean bottom to the west and to the cast, disclosed to the expedition a series of facts that amounts to \"new scien- tific puzzles.\" l \"One was the discovery of prehistoric beach sand . . . brought up in one case from a depth of two and the other nearly three and one half miles, far from any place where beaches exist today.\" One of these sand deposits was found twelve hundred miles from land. Sand is produced from rocks by the eroding action of sea waves pounding the coast, and by the action of rain and wind and the alternation of heat and cold. On the bottom of the ocean the temperature is constant; there are no currents; it is a region of motionless stillness. Mid- ocean bottoms are covered with ooze made up of silt so fine that its particles can be carried suspended in ocean water for a long .time before they sink to the bottom, there to build sediment. The ooze contains skeletons of the minute animals, foraminifera, that live in the upper 5 Johnson, The Origin of the Carolina Bays, p. 93. e Cf. C. P. Olivier, Meteors (1925), p. 240. l M.

But there should be no coarse sand on the mid-ocean floor, because sand is native to land areas and to the continental shelf, the coastal rim of the ocean and its seas. These considerations presented Professor Ewing with a dilemma: \"Either the land must have sunk two to three miles, or the sea once must have been two or three miles lower than now. Either conclusion is startling. If the sea was once two miles lower, where could all the extra water have gone?\" It is regarded as an accepted truth in geology that the seas have not changed their beds with the exception of encroachment by shallow water on depressed conti- nental areas. Thus it was difficult to accept the startling conclusion that the bottom of the ocean was at some time in the past dry land. But there was another surprise in store for the expedi- tion. The thickness of the sediment on the ocean bottom was measured by the well-developed method of sound echoes. An explosion is set off and the time it takes for the echo to return from the sediment on the floor of the ocean is compared with the time required for a second echo to return from the bottom of the sediment, or from the bedrock, basalt or granite. \"These measurements clearly indicate thousands of feet of sediments on the foothills of the Ridge. Surprisingly, however, we have found that in the great flat basins on either side of the Ridge, this sediment appears to be less than 100 feet thick, a fact so startling . . .\" Actually, the echoes arrived almost simultaneously, and the most that could be attrib- uted in such circumstances to the sediment was less than one hundred feet of thickness, or the margin of error. \"Always it had been thought the sediment must be ex- tremely thick, since it had been accumulating for count- less ages. . . . But on the level basins that flank the Mid- Atlantic Ridge our signals reflected from the bottom mud and from bedrock came back too close together to mea- sure the time between them. . . . They show the sediment in the basins is less than 100 feet thick.\" The absence of thick sediment on the level floor pre- sents \"another of many scientific riddles our expedition propounded.\" It indicates that the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean on both sides of the Ridge was only very recently formed.

And how could it be that all other sources, including detritus carried by rivers, have created hi all ages since the begin- ning a sediment of only very moderate thickness? \"We dredged up rocks of igneous, or 'fire-made,* type from the sides and tops of peaks on the Mid- Atlantic Ridge, which indicated that submarine volcanoes and lava flows have been active there. Probably the whole Ridge is highly volcanic, with perhaps thousands of lava out- pourings and active and extinct cones scattered along its entire length.\" And not only the submarine Ridge is volcanic. \"There are many peaks of volcanic origin scattered over the At- lantic Basin.\" In the direction of the Azores the expedi- tion found an uncharted submarine mountain, 8000 feet high, with \"many layers of volcanic ash,\" and farther on, a great hole dropping down 1809 fathoms (10,854 feet), \"as if a volcano had caved in there at some time in the past.\" Lava flowed under the water of the ocean, and the water must have boiled; meteorites, ashes, and cosmic dust fell from the sky; land was submerged thousands of fathoms deep, and beaches sank over three miles into the depths. From the abyss of the ocean, rocks marked with deep scratches were raised by the expedition. \"In a depth of 3600 feet (600 fathoms) we found rocks that tell an in- teresting story about the past history of the Atlantic Ocean . . . granite and sedimentary rocks of types which originally must have been part of a continent.

How they got out here is another riddle to be solved by further research.\" Finally, the very entrance to New York Harbor, the Hudson River, was found to have a canyon running into the ocean, not only for the width of the continental shelf, a hundred and twenty miles offshore, as has been known for some time, but also for another hundred miles in deeper water. \"If all this valley was originally carved out by the river on dry land, as seems probable, it means either that the ocean floor of the Eastern seaboard of North America once must have stood about two miles above its present level and has since subsided, or else that the level of the sea was once about two miles lower than now.\" 2 Each one of these possibilities indicates an up- heaval. All in all, the results of the expedition of the summer of 1949 strongly indicate that, at some time not so long ago, in numerous places where the Atlantic Ocean is to- day there were land and beaches, and that in revolutions on a great scale land became sea thousands of fathoms deep. The leader of the Atlantis expedition, whom we have quoted here, did not use the term \"revolution,\" but it is unavoidable in the face of the expedition's finds.

Petters- son, director of the Oceanographic Institute at Goteborg, \"evidence of great catastrophes that have altered the face of the earth.\" 1 \"Climatic catastrophes, which piled thousands of feet of ice on the higher latitudes of the continents, also cov- ered the oceans with icebergs and ice fields at lower latitudes and chilled the surface waters even down to the Equator. Volcanic catastrophes cast rains of ash over the sea.\" This ash is preserved in the sedimentary bottom of the oceans. \"Tectonic catastrophes raised or lowered the ocean bottom hundreds and even thousands of feet, spreading huge 'tidal' waves which destroyed plant and animal life on the coastal plains.\" At many places, such as the coast of Sweden, the bot- tom of the sea proved to consist of \"a lava bed of geo- logically recent origin, covered only by a thin veneer of sediment. . . . The sediments of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, which often bore particles of volcanic material, also testified to the importance of vulcanism in submarine geology. Some of our cores from the Mediterranean were marked with coarse-grained layers consisting largely of volcanic ash that had settled on the bottom after great volcanic explosions. These layers are an unrivalled record of the irregular volcanic activity of the past.\" The oceanic floor all around the globe bears witness that the oceans of the earth were the scenes of repeated violent catastrophes when flows of lava and volcanic ash covered the precipitously rising or falling bedrock and tidal waves raced against continents. The bottom of the seas and oceans also contains evi- dence that the earth was showered with meteorites on a very large scale. In many places the bottom consists of red clay. Samples of the red clay from the central Pacific showed a \"surprisingly high content of nickel,\" and also a high content of radium, though the water of the ocean, is almost completely free of these elements. 2 The red clay is red because it contains ferruginous (iron) compounds. 1 Pettersson, In advance of the detailed report of the expedition, gave a popular account in an article entitled \"Exploring the Ocean Floor,\" Scientific American, August 1950. 2 Pettersson, \"Chronology of the Deep Ocean Bed,\" Tellus (Quarterly Journal of Geophysics), I, 1949."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"THE FLOOR OF THE SEAS 97 Meteoric iron differs from iron of terrestrial origin in its admixture of nickel, and it is this characteristic that makes it possible to differentiate iron tools of early ages, for instance of the pyramid age in Egypt, and to decide whether iron pieces were smelted from ore or were worked meteorites. \"Nickel is a very rare element in most terrestrial rocks and continental sediments, and it is almost absent from the ocean waters. On the other hand, it is one of the main components of meteorites.\" 3 Thus it is assumed that the origin of the abysmal nickel was in meteoric dust or \"the very heavy showers of mete- ors in the remote past. The principal difficulty of this explanation is that it requires a rate of accretion of meteoric dust several hundred times greater than that which astronomers, who base their estimates on visual and telescopic counts of meteors, are presently prepared to admit.\" 4 In a later publication, a popularized account of the Albatross expedition, Pettersson writes: \"Assuming the average nickel content of meteoric dust to be two per cent, an approximate value for the rate of accretion of cosmic dust to the whole Earth can be worked out from these data. The result is very high about 10,000 tons per day, or over a thousand times higher than the value computed from counting the shooting stars and estimat- ing their mass.\" 6 In other words at some time or times there was such a fall of meteoric dust that, apportioned throughout the entire age of the ocean, it would increase a thousandfold the daily accumulation of meteoric dust since the birth of the ocean. The ash and lava on the bottom of the oceans indicate catastrophic occurrences in the past. Iron and nickel point to celestial showers of meteorites, and thus possibly also to the cause of the tectonic ruptures, of the collapse of the ocean floor and of the outbursts of lava under the surface of great oceanic spaces.

Under the weight of this evidence two great theories of the nineteenth cen- tury have become more and more strained: the theory of uniformity and the theory of evolution built upon it The other fundamental teaching originating in the nine- teenth century the theory of ice ages has been loaded more and more heavily with the responsibility for the geological facts revealed; however, the cause of the ice ages remained a much-discussed and never-agreed-upon subject. The origin of the glacial periods was sought \"on the earth below and in the heaven above.\" The theories that endeavored to explain what caused them fall under the following headings: astronomical, geological, and atmos- pherical. In the first group, some theories seek the cause of the ice ages in space, some in the sun, some in the relative positions of the sun and the earth. One idea was that the space through which the solar system traveled was not always of equally low temperature, the variations being 99"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"100 POLES DISPLACED due to gases or dust present in some areas. This idea has been abandoned. Another theory was that the sun is a variable star emitting more heat at some periods and less at others. This theory also failed to be substantiated and was generally rejected; yet sporadically it finds new pro- ponents. 1 Still another theory would have the ice ages arrive when a hemisphere, the Northern or the Southern, happens to have its winter while the globe is at the far- thest end of its ellipse, as the Southern Hemisphere is at present. The winter would be a little longer and colder; however, the summer, though a bit shorter, would be hotter, and if the earth always traveled on its present orbit, the described variations would not bring about an ice age. It was also claimed that the terrestrial orbit be- comes alternately more and less stretched. Of the geological group of theories, one supposed a change in the activity of warm springs; another, a change in the direction of the Gulf Stream, which carries water warmed in the Caribbean Sea to the northern Atlantic; if there were no Isthmus of Panama, and North and South America were separated, a part of the stream from the Caribbean would flow into the Pacific. Both these theories were shown to be inadequate, and the paleonto- logical survey of sea fauna on both sides of the isthmus suggests that the dividing strip of land existed long be- fore the advent of the Ice Age. Another geological theory, which still has some adherents, sees the origin of the glacial periods in the changing altitude of the conti- nents, which would also influence the direction of winds and precipitation. But it is definitely opposed by such an authority on glacial geology as A. P. Coleman, professor emeritus of geology at Toronto University: \"When one considers the distribution of ice sheets in the Pleistocene, covering 4,000,000 square miles of North America and half as much of Europe . . . [and the ice in] Greenland, Iceland, Spitsbergen . . . the southern island of New Zealand and Patagonia in South America, it be- comes evident that all parts of the world could not have been elevated at once. The theory breaks down of its own weight.\" Therefore \"elevation above snow line would cause local glaciation, but there is no evidence that large scale ice sheets can be formed in this way, and that a 1 Barbara Bell, Science Newsletter, May 24, 1952."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"SHIFTING POLES 101 universal refrigeration, like that of the Pleistocene, could be produced thus is manifestly impossible.\" 2 Of the atmospheric conditions that could effect a rise or drop in temperature, the varying quantity of carbon dioxide in the air and also of dust particles was called on to explain the changes in temperature in the past. With the diminution of the carbon dioxide content in the air there would be a fall in the temperature, but it was dem- onstrated by calculation that this could not have been sufficient to cause the Ice Age. If the earth were enveloped in clouds of dust that kept the rays of the sun from penetrating to the ground, there would be a fall hi temperature. However, one would have to explain where such extensive and thick clouds of dust in the atmos- phere could come from. \"Scores of methods of accounting for ice ages have been proposed, and probably no other geological prob- lem has been so earnestly discussed, not only by geologists but by meteorologists and biologists; and yet no theory is generally accepted.\" 8 A true theory of the origin of ice ages, whether resorting to astronomical, geological, or atmospheric causes, must also explain why ice ages did not occur in northeastern Siberia, the coldest place on earth, but did occur in tem- perate latitudes, and in a much more remote past in India, Madagascar, and equatorial Brazil. None of the theories mentioned explains these strange facts. Hypoth- eses concerning warmer and colder areas in space, or the variability of the sun as a source of energy, are es- pecially inadequate to account for the geographical dis- tribution of the ice cover. Thus the concept of ice ages, which is established in science as one of its most definite facts, serving also as a foundation for the theory of evo- lution, has no explanation itself.

If for some reason the poles had moved from their original positions, old polar ice would have moved out of the Arctic and Ant- arctic circles and into new regions. The glacial cover of the Ice Age could have been the polar icecap of an earlier epoch. Thus would be explained not only the origin of the ice cover but also the fact that its geo- graphical position did not coincide with the present Polar Circles. \"The simplest and most obvious explanation of great secular changes in climate, and of former prevalence of higher temperatures in northern circumpolar regions, would be found in the assumption that the earth's axis of rotation has not always had the same position, but that it may have changed its position as a result of geological processes, such as extended rearrangement of land and water.\" l For decades in the second half of the nineteenth cen- tury many scientists participated in the debate centering around this theme. Astronomers and mathematicians asked the geologists what, in their opinion, could have caused such a shifting of the terrestrial poles. The best the geologists could offer was the redisposition of the weight on the surface of the earth. Sir George B. Airy, astron- omer royal, analyzed the question by assuming that the earth ,a perfectly rigid spheroid (a flattened globe), was disturbed in its rotation by a sudden elevation of a mountainous mass in latitudes \"most favorable for pro- duction of a large effect.\" The axis of rotation would no longer coincide with the axis of figure, and there would be wobbling. \"Under these circumstances, the axis of ro- tation would wander in the solid earth. But it would not wander indefinitely. . . .\" However, the smallness of the effect would be disap- pointing. If a mountain mass should be produced equal to one one-thousandth part of the mass of the equatorial bulge \"which I apprehend is very far above the fact . . . the shift of the earth's pole would be only two or three miles, and this, though it would greatly surprise astron- 1 Julius Hann (Austrian meteorologist, 1839-1921), quoted by W.

If an ocean bed 15,000 feet deep rose to become a continent the size of Africa 1100 feet above sea level, and on the other side of the globe an equal area became depressed, the effect would be a shift of the poles by about two degrees. However, were the earth plastic, the poles would wander to a greater extent. James Croll, the Scottish climatologist, wrote: \"There probably never was an upheaval of such mag- nitude in the history of our earth. And to produce a de- flection of 3 17' a deflection that would hardly sensibly affect climate no less than one-tenth of the entire surface of the earth would require to be elevated to the height of 10,000 feet. A continent ten times the size of Europe elevated two miles would do little more than bring Lon- don to the latitude of Edinburgh, or Edinburgh to the latitude of London. He must be a sanguine geologist in- deed who can expect to account for the glaciation of this country, or for the former absence of ice around the poles, by this means. We know perfectly well that since the Glacial epoch there have been no changes in the physical geography of the earth sufficient to deflect the pole half a dozen miles, far less half a dozen degrees.\" 8 J. Evans, a geologist, suggested that the astronomers reconsider their conclusion, on the supposition that the earth is a shell filled with molten matter. He envisaged the possibility that, under a change of load hi the crust, the crust would be forced to alter its position in relation to the axis by as much as twenty degrees. 4 Sir William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), the physicist, took up the issue and retorted that \"the earth cannot, as many geologists suppose, be a liquid mass enclosed in only a thin shell of solidified matter.\" 5 \"At the surface and for many miles below the surface, the rigidity [of the earth] is certainly very much less than that of iron; and 2 Athenaeum, September 22, 1860, p. 384. 3 J.

The state of the case is shortly this: The hypothesis of a perfectly rigid crust containing liquid, violates physics by assuming pre- ternaturally rigid matter, and violates dynamical astron- omy. . . .\" 6 Lord Kelvin admitted, however, that a larger shifting of the poles would be possible if the earth had a solid nucleus in the interior separated by a liquid layer from the outer crust. This he regarded as improbable and di- rected his argument against an earth with a molten in- terior. George Darwin supported the views of Lord Kelvin, presenting figures to show that the earth could not have a fluid nucleus; its rigidity must be at least as great as that of steel. 7 Thus the efforts of the geologists to explain the origin of the ice cover by the shifting of the poles foundered on the calculations of the mathematicians. A mathematician made the point clear: \"Mathematicians may seem to geologists almost churl- ish in their unwillingness to admit a change in the earth's axis. Geologists scarcely know how much is involved in what they ask. They do not seem to realize the vastness of the earth's size, or the enormous quantity of her motion. When a mass of matter is in rotation about an axis, it cannot be made to rotate about a new one except by ex- ternal force. Internal changes cannot alter the axis, only the distribution of the matter and motion about it.

The explanation that appeared best to the geologists was re- jected by the physicists and astronomers, who for their part could not propose any other satisfactory solution. Further developments showed that tides in the terres- trial crust under the influence of moon and sun, unknown to Lord Kelvin, do exist, though they are minute; this means that the earth is not perfectly rigid. It was also found that the earth makes a real wobbling motion. S. C. Chandler, an American astronomer (1846-1913), ex- plained the wobbling of the earth as an indication of its being removed from a balanced position. Simon New- comb, foremost American mathematical astronomer, in his paper, \"On the Periodic Variation of Latitude,\" wrote: \"Chandler's remarkable discovery that the apparent variation in terrestrial latitudes may be accounted for by supposing a revolution of the axis of rotation of the earth around that of figure ... is in such disaccord with the received theory of the earth's rotation, that, at first, I was disposed to doubt its possibility.\" However, on re- consideration, he found a theoretical justification: \"Theory then shows that the axis of rotation will revolve around that of figure, in a period of 306 days and in a direction from west toward east.\" 9 G. V. Schiaparelli, the Italian astronomer, in his re- search, De la rotation de la terre sous I'influence des ac- tions geologiques (1889), pointed out that in the case of displacement the pole of inertia (or of figure) and the new pole of rotation would describe circles around each other, and the earth would be in a state of strain. \"The earth is at present in this condition and as a result the 8 Geological Magazine (1878), 265. 9 Simon Newcomb, Astronomical Journal, XI (1891); Cf.

The question centers, then, on the forces that could have caused such a shift. Schiaparelli wrote: \"The permanence of the geograph- ical poles in the very same regions of the earth cannot yet be considered as incontestably established by astronomical or mechanical arguments. Such permanence may be a fact today, but it remains a matter still to be proven for the preceding ages of the history of the globe.\" n He thought that a series of geological changes could, by their cumu- lative effect, step by step, destroy the equilibrium of the earth, on condition that the earth is not an absolutely rigid body. \"The possibility of great shifting of the pole is an important element in the discussion of prehistoric climates and the distribution, geographic and chronologic, of an- cient organisms. If this possibility is admitted, it will open new horizons for the study of great mechanical revolu- tions that the crust of the earth underwent in the past. We cannot imagine, for instance, that the terrestrial equator could take the place of a meridian, without great horizon- tal tension in some regions, that would open great rifts; and in other regions, horizontal compressions would have taken place, such as are imagined today in order to ex- plain the folding of the strata and formation of moun- tains.'* The resistance of the spheroid or the terrestrial globe, flattened at the poles, to a change in position must, in Schiaparelli's opinion, show itself also in the leveling of great areas and the extension of shallow seas, like that of the Baltic and North seas. He finished by saying: \"Our problem, so important from the astronomical and mathe- matical standpoint, touches the foundations of geology and paleontology: its solution is tied to the most grandi- ose events in the history of the Earth.\" Thus, finally, an eminent astronomer, after a thorough examination of the problem, went over to the side of the geologist. However, he reasoned in a circle: the geological changes would cause the terrestrial poles to move from 10 Later observations put the Eulerian, or Chandler's, period at 428 to 429 days. 11 G. V.

A gradual and slow displacement of the poles or a tilt- ing of the axis would explain the geographical position of the ice in the past, but it would not account for other phenomena observed, such as the extent of the glacial cover and the suddenness with which it enveloped the earth. Agassiz realized this, and in support of the idea that the ice ages came suddenly, he quoted Cuvier. Cuvier died before the Ice Age theory was promulgated, but he understood that the climate must have altered suddenly in order to encase the large quadrupeds of Siberia in ice as soon as they were killed, and to preserve their bodies from decay since then. \"Therefore,\" wrote Cuvier in prophetic anticipation of the debate that has been renewed for over a hundred years, down to our times, \"all hypotheses of a gradual cooling of the earth, or a slow variation of the inclination or position of the terrestrial axis, are inadequate.\" la The Sliding Continents The geological changes hi the distribution of land and water being inadequate to explain the shifting of the poles, the problem is thrown back once more into the domain of astronomy. But before we ask, \"What forces in the solar system could have displaced the terrestrial axis?\" we shall discuss a theory that has for over three decades occupied the minds of geologists, climatologists, and evo- lutionists the theory of the shifting continents. Instead of the poles shifting, according to Wegener's theory the continents drift and pass one after the other through the southern and northern polar regions. In August 1950 the British Association for the Ad- vancement of Science devoted the sessions of its annual convention to debate on the question: Is the -theory of the continental drift (slide) right or wrong? There were many defenders of the theory and as many opponents. The theory was then put to a vote. The result was an even division between \"yea\" and \"nay.\" The chairman was 12 Agassiz, Etudes sur les glaciers, p. 311; Cuvier, Recherches sur les ossements fossiles (2nd ed.), I, 202."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"108 POLES DISPLACED entitled to cast the deciding vote but abstained. Only through the fortuitous circumstance that the presiding officer was a conscientious or undecided person was the sanctification of continental drift averted. The theory of drifting continents, debated since the 1920s, has its starting point in the \"similarity of the shapes of the coastlines of Brazil and Africa.\" l This similarity (or, better, complementation) plus some early faunal and floral affinities suggested to Professor Alfred Wegener of Graz in Styria that in an early geological age these two continents, South America and Africa, were one land mass. But since animal and vegetable affinities could also be found in other parts of the world, Wegener conjectured that all continents and islands were once a single land mass that in various epochs divided and drifted apart. Those who do not subscribe to the theory of continental drift continue to explain the affinity of plants and animals by \"land bridges\" or former land con- nections between continents and also between continents and islands. In order that continents might move, it is claimed that there must be a basic difference between the composition of the earth's crust that is exposed in land masses and that which exists on the bottom of the ocean. The theory of drifting continents is grounded on the \"increasingly well-proven doctrine of isostasy or the flotation of the crust of the earth\" on plastic magma. A new nomen- clature was introduced. The land masses or the outer crust are called sial, an abbreviation of silicon and alumi- num, two of the elements predominant in the composition of terrestrial rocks. The substratum is called sima, an abbreviation of silicon and magnesium, there being a \"good reason for believing that the rocks forming the substratum [bottom] of the ocean bed are more basic in composition and contain a large proportion of magnesia [magnesium oxide].\" 2 It is also assumed that the sima underlies the sial of the continents and, possessing the plastic properties of sealing wax, permits the continents to drift.

According to Wegener, mountainous crests rose, in the movement of the land, on the forward side of the floating continents; meeting some resistance in its motion on elastic sima, the sial formed elevations. Thus, when South America moved away from Africa, an eleva- tion was raised on the side turned to the Pacific Ocean, the Andes. If, from the beginning, there was but one land mass, there could have been only one ocean, too, and, according to Wegener, the only ocean was the Pacific. The Atlantic is a later formation, and its bottom cannot be of sima, like that of the Pacific, but is built of stretched sial. Suffi- cient proof of the difference in composition of the sub- strata of the Atlantic and the Pacific has not yet been adduced. The occurrence in an early glacial period of ice cover in lands now in tropical and subtropical regions is ex- plained by the supposition that these lands were once in the Antarctic. However, their extent is so great that if all of them were joined around the South Pole, many parts that have signs of the Ice Age would still be too remote from the pole. The theory assumes, therefore, that these lands occupied in succession the position of the Antarctic continent today, each in its turn passing through a glacial period; the signs of glaciation in Africa, India, Australia, and South America are accounted for by the successive sliding of these continents through the southern polar re- gion. A similar explanation is offered for the origin of the Ice Age in the Northern Hemisphere, at a much more recent date, when the land masses of North America and Europe wandered close to the North Pole. The North Pole is charted on various points on the globe in the Pacific, hi the Canadian arctic archipelago, in Greenland, hi Spitsbergen all in succession during the Pleistocene, or recent Ice Age.

If a theory can explain the origin of mountains, the cause of the ice ages, the coal beds in higher latitudes, and certain common characteristics of the fauna and flora of continents separated by oceans, then the correspond- ence in the contours of the Brazilian and West African coasts truly served as a clue to the solution of major prob- lems in geology and climatology. However, there are facts that strongly challenge this hypothesis. The minute difference between the gravitational pulls to which the crust is subjected in higher latitudes and closer to the equator was offered by Wegener as the mo- tive force in the drift of continents. But Harold Jeffreys, a British cosmologist, computed that this force is one hundred billion times too weak to produce the effect \"There is therefore not the slightest reason to believe that bodily displacements of continents through the lithosphere [the crust] are possible.\" 3 Even assuming that this motive force was sufficient, why did the lands of Europe, Siberia, and North America first move away from the original common land mass toward the equator and then retreat from the equator? In search of another moving force, A. L. du Toit, a South African scientist, offered a variation of Wegener's theory, namely, a \"concept of an earth in which the peri- odic, though variable, softening of the sub-crust through radioactive heating enables the skin to creep differentially over the core with consequent wrinkling.\" 4 As for the mountains, not all of them are situated as long ridges parallel to the seacoast. And no compelling evidence has been brought to support the contention that ice ages were consecutive in various parts of the Southern Hemisphere and, in much more recent times, in various parts of the Northern Hemisphere. Furthermore, how ex- plain signs of the recent Ice Age in the Southern Hem- isphere? In Patagonia, New Zealand, and other places in the Southern Hemisphere, signs of recent glaciation are found. It is also certain that the chilling of the Ice Age was simultaneous all over the world. Coal is found not only in arctic lands but also in Ant- 8 H.

And what was the motive force? If the theory is correct, the motion of the continents should be observable at present; yet, though Wegener claimed, on the basis of certain reports, that Greenland and an island near its western coast still move, repeated observations and triangulations do not support this claim. Wegener perished on an expedition to Greenland in 1930. The assumption that ocean floors and continents are eternally different in structure is in contradiction to a great number of observations, though the land surface has been better explored than the bottom of the sea. The idea of a basic difference between the rocks of the ocean bot- tom and those of the continents is disproved wherever the fossiliferous contents of the land and of the ocean bed are examined. Marine expeditions have failed to find at various places on the ocean bottom the thick layers of sediment that should have been present if the sea had been covering the areas for untold centuries. On the other hand, sediments thousands and even tens of thousands of feet thick have been found on continents. Not only were large stretches of land in North America and Europe and Asia covered by the sea at various times in the past and some well-investigated localities, like the gypsum beds of Paris, show repeated returns of the waters but even the largest and highest mountain chains the Alps, the Andes, the Himalayas at some time were under the sea. Since the ocean once covered a vast expanse of land, it may at present occupy the place of former land. The land masses of today do not change their latitudes; the motive force claimed is insufficient by far. Coal beds in Antarctica and recent glaciation in temperate latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere all conspire to invalidate the theory of wandering continents. The Changing Orbit The theory of sliding continents having been shown to be built on infirm foundations, there remain three theoreti- cal changes in the position of the terrestrial globe or its shell in relation to the sun that could cause great varia- tions of climate: a change in the form of the orbit, or the path the earth follows around the sun; a change in the"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"112 POLES DISPLACED astronomical direction of the axis; a change in the posi- tion of the terrestrial shell in relation to the core, and thus in the position of the poles (sliding shell). At present the elliptical form of the orbit changes by a very small amount. This could be the residue of a displace- ment the earth suffered on its path; but following the principle of Laplace and Lagrange concerning the stability of the planetary system, this variation in the shape of the terrestrial orbit is considered to be an oscillation, the mean shape of the orbit being regarded as fixed. The period of this oscillation is supposed to be of very long duration. The obliquity of the ecliptic, or the angle which the plane of the equator makes with the plane of the earth's orbit, is 23 l /i ; this obliquity causes the sequence of the seasons. It changes now at the rate of 0.47\" a year, \"but the limits of its variation are difficult to calculate.\" l The figures offered by various mathematicians differ greatly. Lagrange estimated the angle of the swing to be as large as 7 with a period that had its last maximum in the year 2167 before the present era; Stockwell calculated the angle of oscillation at less than 3; while Drayson estimated that the obliquity ranged from 35 to 11, that is, a swing of 24. z This variation, whatever its numerical value, could have been caused by a disturbance which the earth suffered; but again, the cause being unidentified, the effect is considered to be a permanent oscillation. The earth experiences the precession of the equinoxes, or a large spin of the axis with consequent displacement of the seasons in relation to the perihelion (the point on the orbit closest to the sun). This precession or \"preced- ing\" of the vernal and autumnal equinoxes is as great as 50.2\" in a year, and the terrestrial axis describes a wide circle in the sky in a period estimated at about 26,000 years. Newton explained this phenomenon, known since the days of Hipparchus ( 120), as produced by the attractive effect of the sun and the moon on the bulging part of the equator. But this explanation does not ac- count for what in the first place caused the earth's bulging part or equator to take the position under an angle to the plane of terrestrial revolution, or ecliptic. 1 Brooks, Climate through the Ages (2nd ed.; 1949), p. 102. 2 Ibid."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"THE ROTATING CRUST 113 This swing of the terrestrial axis as though the globe were a top disturbed in its motion could also be caused by a disturbance in the motion of the earth experienced sometime in the past. Finally, we have already spoken of the wobbling of the terrestrial axis, or its describing a small circle around the geographical pole, or, better, of the wandering of the pole that causes small variations in latitudes, discovered late in the nineteenth century. A theory that employed the changes in eccentricity of the orbit and the precession of the equinoxes to explain the variations of climate was advanced in 1864 by James Croll, and accepted by Charles Darwin and others; it has since been abandoned, for it requires alternate glacial ages in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, and the evi- dence contradicts such an order of events. More recently, M. Milankovitch introduced the third variable, the obliquity of the ecliptic, to correct some of the defects of Croll's theory. In the opinion of his critics, however, his curve of climatic changes widely upsets geological dates; nor do his variables offer sufficiently effective reasons for the vigorous changes of climate. Besides, he assigned an arbitrary length to the oscillation period of obliquity. And why were there no ice ages during long periods in the past, if the process recurs at calculable intervals? Thus the inquiry turned once more to a more radical change the displacement of the terrestrial crust in rela- tion to the core. The Rotating Crust The theory that the terrestrial crust is swimming on magma was first offered when J. H. Pratt, in the 1850s, found that the Himalayas, the largest massif on earth, do not exert the expected gravitational pull and do not deflect a plumbline. Astronomer G. B. Airy was surprised, to the point of disbelief in fact; but then he offered a theory that the granite crust, much lighter than the magma under- neath, is only sixty miles thick, and that under the moun- tains, on the inside of the crust, there are reversed moun- tains, immersed in the heavier magma, which would"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"114 POLES DISPLACED account for the lack of gravitational pull by mountains. 1 This is the theory of isostasy. To the study of isostasy and its anomalies (gravitation is, strangely, stronger over deep seas), F. A. Vening Meinesz, Dutch geophysicist and explorer of oceans, made many important contributions. He found in the very structure of the terrestrial crust signs of some violent displacements on a global scale. Thus it is not merely in order to explain the climates of the past that the disloca- tion of the crust is postulated. In 1943, Vening Meinesz analyzed \"the stresses brought about by a change in position of the rigid Earth's crust with regard to the axis of rotation of the Earth.\" In this analysis he surmised the crust \"to have the same thickness everywhere and to be- have as an elastic body.\" He pointed out that if we assume that the crust happened to move clockwise in relation to the core by over 70 the expected effect \"shows a remark- able correlation to many major topographic features and also to the shearing patterns of large parts of the Earth's surface, as, e.g., the North and South Atlantic, the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden, Africa, the Pacific, etc. If the correlation is not fortuitous, and this does not appear probable, we have to suppose that the Earth's crust at some moment of its history has indeed shifted with regard to the Earth's poles and that the crust has undergone a corresponding block-shearing.\" 2 However, according to the theory of isostasy, the crust is not of the same thickness everywhere, the crustal protuberances are immersed in a very thick and viscous magma, and for the crust to move, even if it is only sixty miles thick, would require a greater force than is avail- able under prevailing conditions in the solar system or on the earth itself. The very idea of a crust changing its position in relation to the axis of the interior, or of the globe itself, presup- poses the validity of the theory of isostasy. This theory, though generally accepted, finds difficulty in explaining 1 J. H.

A. Pauly, propagates the idea offered, or revived, by the astronomer A. S. Eddington in his paper, 'The Borderland of Geology and Astronomy.\" According to Eddington, the ice ages were caused by the shifting of the earth's outer crust over its interior as a result of tidal friction or the inequality of lunar pull on various layers of the earth; this theory abandons every effort to find in the earth itself the force that might cause the crust in its entirety to change its position in relation to the terrestrial axis, which, in this theory, maintains its astronomical direction. In order to pull the lithosphere, or crust, over the substratum, or core, a lesser force is required than that needed to incline the axis of the whole globe in some new direction, for the crust is but a portion of the entire mass of the earth, and the momentum is dependent on the mass. However, in order to move the crust, preserving the axis of the core as that of the entire globe, the friction between the crust and the substratum must be overcome; and be- cause of the equatorial bulge, in order to alter the posi- tion of the crust, it must be stretched in some parts. This would require the application of a great force, which does not appear to exist in tidal friction originating in the moon. Furthermore, the tidal force acts on the surface of the earth in an east-west direction; and a change in this direc- tion would not disturb the position of the latitudes in W Bowie. \"Uostasy,\" In Physics of the Earth, ed.

Eddington's theory requires the sliding of the crust northward and southward; to explain the origin of such sliding, he suggested that the crust, moving slowly in the east-west direction, upon meeting some excessive local friction between itself and the substratum, would change its course. But, as indicated above, the tidal fric- tion of the moon could hardly stretch the crust over the equatorial bulge. The theory of the sliding lithosphere shares the quanti- tative inadequacy of the theory of sliding continents. Some motive agent more powerful than tidal friction (Eddington), or gravitational differences at various lati- tudes (Wegener), or intermittent radioactivity in the earth (Du Toit), must have been at work in order to move continents or the entire lithosphere. Thus these theories meet the fate of the earlier theory that postulated the shifting of the poles because of a geological redis- tribution of land and sea. Also the theory that would explain the displacement of the crust by an asymmetric growth of the polar icecaps is quantitatively indefensible; this theory uses the same phenomenon the growing icecaps as the cause and the effect of ice ages. The present survey of theories, which are quantita- tively inadequate yet based on the well-reasoned principle of a change of latitudes or ^he direction of the axis as the cause of the ice ages, was here undertaken to make clear that thoughtful researchers among geologists, climatol- ogists, and astronomers were unsatisfied with views that would not solve the problem of the geographical distribu- tion of the ice cover in the past, a point of which almost all other theories are strangely oblivious. It follows, then, that the clamor heard at the publication of Worlds in Collision, even from some astronomers and geologists, to the effect that the shifting axis or changing latitudes had never been heard of, is not supported by scientific litera- ture. W. B. Wright, of the Geological Survey of Great Britain, finds that the only way to explain ice ages is to assume that \"the earth's axis of rotation has not always had the same position\"; and \"since it has now become obvious that geological history has witnessed many changes in the position of the climatic zones on the surface of the earth"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"THE ROTATING CRUST 117 and that at least one notable glaciation, that of the Permo- Carboniferous [preceding the time of the large reptiles], was due to a displacement of the pole from its present position, it becomes worth while to inquire whether the Quaternary [Recent] glaciation would not have a similar cause.\" 5 But every inquiry in this direction, in Wright's opinion, failed to find a cause that would account for recurrent but not periodic ice ages; they did not return through geological history at measured intervals. Therefore he concluded: \"Among the theories that have been brought forward to account for the phenomena of the Ice Age, there is not a single one which meets the facts of the case in such a manner as to inspire confidence.\" 6 Not only must the cause have been more powerful than the agents invoked, but it must have acted with great sud- denness. On this we shall dwell in the following sections.

If the crust moved, the latitudes would be displaced and, in an extreme case, the poles and the equator could change places; and if the axis turned in a new direction, seasons would change their order and intensity and, in an extreme case, a polar region could be turned for a large part of the year into the warmest place on the globe, being day and night under the direct rays of the sun, as presently is the case with Uranus.

Also, if from the beginning there was a difference in the direc- tion of the axes of terrestrial rotation and lunar revolution, this difference must have disappeared as the result of tidal friction. Jeffreys considered the works of George Darwin, who tried to explain the observed positions by recourse to several additional tidal frictions, but he found a flaw in Darwin's hypothesis. Any internal changes hi the earth would be \"not im- portant\" for the observed change in the direction of the terrestrial axis. Jeffreys says: \"If we consider the axis of the earth's angular momentum, this can change in direc- tion only through couples acting on the earth from out- side.\" The arguments of astronomers against the idea of the geologists concerning the change in the position of the terrestrial axis were correct only in showing that the ter- restrial causes could not effectively displace the axis of the earth; but the very fact of displacement is now claimed because of astronomical considerations and by such an authority in this field as Jeffreys. What could have played the role of couples, or a vise, acting from outside? Ajid, again, was it a gradual change or a sudden displacement? Evaporating Oceans If we take into account the area occupied by ice hi the glacial epoch, much larger than the area of the present polar ice, we must conclude that the shifting of the poles alone cannot explain the origin of the glacial cover. The expansion of the glacial cover in its various stages is sup- posed to be known. The usual estimate of its thickness is between six and twelve thousand feet. From these figures the mass of the ice is calculated and the quantity of water necessary to produce it. The water must have come from the oceans; it is estimated that the surface of the oceans must have been at least three hundred feet lower when the ice cover was developed.

John Tyndall, a British physicist of the last century, wrote: \"Some eminent men have thought, and some still think, that the reduction of temperature, during the glacial epoch, was due to a temporary diminution of solar radiation; others have thought that, in its motion through space, our system may have traversed regions of low temperature, and that during its passage through these regions, the ancient glaciers were produced. . . . Many of them seem to have overlooked the fact that the enormous extension of glaciers in bygone ages demonstrates, just as rigidly, the operation of heat as well as the action of cold. Cold [alone] will not produce glaciers.\" 1 Tyndall then went on to demonstrate the amount of heat necessary to transport water to the polar regions in the form of snow. He calculated that for every pound of vapor produced a quantity of heat is required sufficient to raise five pounds of cast iron to the melting point. Con- sequently, in order to evaporate the oceans and transform the water into aqueous clouds that would later descend as snow and turn to ice, a quantity of heat was needed that would raise to the melting point a mass of iron five times greater than the mass of the ice. Tyndall argued that the geologists should substitute the hot iron for the cold ice, and they would get an idea of the high temperature immediately preceding the Ice Age and the formation of the glacial cover. If this is so, then none of the theories offered in ex- planation of the Ice Age really would account for it. Even if the sun disappeared and the earth lost its heat to cosmic space, there would be no Ice Age: the oceans and all the water would freeze, but there would be no ice formation on land. The importance of heat in the formation of the ice cover of the Ice Age was stressed even more by another author, an astronomer of our day (D. Menzel, of the l John Tyndall, Heat Considered as a Mode of Motion (1883), pp. 191-92."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"EVAPORATING OCEANS 121 Harvard Observatory) : \"// solar variability caused the ice ages, I should prefer to believe that increased warmth brought them on, whereas a diminution of heat caused them to stop.\" 2 What could have brought about such a rise hi the temperature of the oceans that, all over the globe, they evaporated enough to lower their surface not three, not thirty, but more than three hundred feet? Could the heat have been generated by the decomposition of organic mat- ter in the sediment? It goes without saying that this source would have been utterly inadequate. A tremendous heat- ing process must have preceded the formation of the ice cover; and since it is generally maintained that there were at least four glacial periods in the recent [Quaternary] Ice Age, in each of which the ice grew and then retreated in the interglacial stage, the globe, in a recent geological epoch, must have been repeatedly so hot that the portion of the heat the oceans received would have sufficed to turn an immense mountain of iron, five times the mass of the continental ice cover, to a white glow and melt it. According to Tyndall, if this did not happen, there could not have been any ice ages. Do we know under what circumstances the earth and its oceans would be heated on a stupendous scale? If we subscribe to the Ice Age theory, we must assume that the terrestrial globe with its oceans was heated as in a furnace, in the age of man, since the Ice Age, together with the Recent, is the age of man. Large stretches of the bottoms of the oceans must have bubbled with lava. But what could have produced this simultaneous activity of subterranean heat over such vast areas? We cannot imagine any cause or agent for this, unless it be an exogenous agent, an extraterrestrial cause. For the removal of the poles from their places, or the shifting of the axis, also, only an external agent could have been responsible. The adherents of the Ice Age theory must look to the celestial sphere for the causes of at least four separate encounters, in the not too distant past, with some celestial mass of matter or field of force. On passing through a large cloud of dust particles or meteorites, the earth and its atmosphere would be heated by the direct impact of these bodies on its atmosphere, its 2D.

Under such an impact a displacement of the poles or disturbance in axial rotation would also produce heat in every particle of the globe, because of the conversion of a portion of the energy of motion into heat. This is one theoretical possibility. The other possibility would be that, on passing through a cloud of dust carrying an electromagnetic charge, the earth would react with electrical currents on its surface that would develop a thermal effect. If the earth passed through a strong field, the heat would be very intense. Selecting the better conducting strata, these currents would go through metal-bearing formations, possibly deeper in the crust, sparing life in some quarters and destroying it in others. Such heat could evaporate oceans to a great depth, cause the intrusion of igneous rock into sedimentary rock, start the flow of magma from fissures, and activate all volcanoes. The earth is itself a large magnet. A charged cloud of dust or gases, moving in relation to the earth, would be an electromagnet. An extraneous electromagnetic field that would produce a thermal effect on the earth would also shift the terrestrial axis and change the rotational velocity of the earth. This, in turn, would have a thermal effect, since the energy of motion would be converted into heat, and possibly into other forms of energy electrical, magnetic, and chemical, as well as nuclear with ensuing radioactivity, again with thermal effect. An extraneous mechanical or electromagnetic force would produce both phenomena, which are prerequisites of a glacial period: the astronomical or geographical shift- ing of the axis and the heating of the globe. The astrono- mers who oppose the theory of cosmic catastrophes must likewise reject the theory of the ice ages. Condensation In the preceding section it was made clear that, for the ice cover of the glacial epoch to be formed, evaporation of the oceans on a large scale must have occurred. But evaporation of the oceans would not be enough; rapid and powerful condensation of the vapors must have followed. \"We need a condenser so powerful that this vapour, in-"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"CONDENSATION 123 stead of falling in liquid showers to the earth, shall be so far reduced in temperature as to descend as snow.\" 1 An unusual sequence of events was necessary: the oceans must have steamed and the vaporized water must have fallen as snow in latitudes of temperate climates. This sequence of heat and cold must have taken place in quick succession. 4U A precipitate drop in temperature and a rapid condensa- tion of vapors could have followed from the screening effect of clouds of dust. Dust of either volcanic or meteoric origin, by enveloping the earth, could have impaired the solar light and warmth reaching the lower atmosphere. The dust particles ejected by erupting volcanoes have been observed to float in the sky around the globe for many months. So, after the eruption of Krakatoa in Sunda Strait between Java and Sumatra in 1883, dust particles suspended in the atmosphere continued for over a year to act as a screen around the world that caused the sunsets to be unusually colorful. 2 Dust from many volcanoes could build a screen that would obstruct the solar light. Actually the screening of the earth by clouds of dust of volcanic origin was one of the theories concerning the origin of ice in the glacial epochs; however, like heat alone, cold alone would not have sufficed to produce the continental ice covers. In the struggle between heat and cold, snow would de- scend in some parts of the world and torrential rains in others. And, in fact, numerous scientists who conducted their field study in various areas outside the former ice cover came to the conclusion that those areas had experi- enced periods of torrential rains that were simultaneous with the glacial periods in higher latitudes. Gregory, study- ing the African continent, observed signs of water action on a great scale at the same time that other areas were being covered by advancing ice. 8 There remained in the Sahara and adjacent regions stream channels \"not now occupied by water courses\" that obviously carried great quantities of water. \"It is believed probable that these streamways were trenched during a pluvial age or pluvial 1 Tyndall, Heat Considered as a Mode of Motion, pp. 188-89. 2 Cf.

In the Pluvial, Lake Victoria in Africa stood over 300 feet above its present level; since that time there was a complete reversal of the river system in the region. 4 Shor Kul, a salt lake in Sinkiang, had its level 350 feet higher than it is today. Lake Bonneville, which occupied parts of Utah, Nevada, and Idaho, and collected pluvial water as well as melt water from the local glaciers in the mountains, stood \"more than 1000 feet above the present Great Salt Lake.\" 5 Although some geologists, on theoretical grounds, would prefer to think that a dry climate prevailed in the world when so much water was concentrated in the ice covers, field geology shows the opposite to have been the case: snow fell in huge masses, and rain cascaded from the sky at the very same time. A Working Hypothesis Let us assume, as a working hypothesis, that under the impact of a force or the influence of an agent and the earth does not travel in an empty universe the axis of the earth shifted or tilted. At that moment an earthquake would make the globe shudder. Air and water would con- tinue to move through inertia; hurricanes would sweep the earth and the seas would rush over continents, carrying gravel and sand and marine animals, and casting them on the land. Heat would be developed, rocks would melt, volcanoes would erupt, lava would flow from fissures in the ruptured ground and cover vast areas. Mountains would spring up from the plains and would travel and climb on the shoulders of other mountains, causing faults and rifts. Lakes would be tilted and emptied, rivers would change then- beds; large land areas with all their in- habitants would slip under the sea. Forests would burn, and the hurricanes and wild seas would wrest them from the ground on which they grew and pile them, branch and root, in huge heaps. Seas would turn into deserts, their waters rolling away. And if a change in the velocity of the diurnal rotation 4 L. S. B.

The shifting of the axis would also change the climate of every place, leaving corals in Newfoundland and elephants in Alaska, fig trees in north- ern Greenland and luxuriant forests hi Antarctica. In the event of a rapid shift of the axis, many species and genera of animals on land and in the sea would be destroyed, and civilizations, if any, would be reduced to ruins. Water evaporated from the oceans would rise in clouds and fall again in torrential rams and snowfalls. Clouds of dust, ejected by numerous volcanoes and swept by hurri- canes from the ground, and possibly dust clouds of extra- neous origin if a cometary train of meteorites was the foreign body causing the upheaval all this dust would keep the rays of the sun from penetrating to the earth. The temperature under the clouds would be reduced, but close to the ground it would be higher than normal be- cause the heated earth would, by convection, dissipate its heat into the atmosphere. Great streams would be formed by the melting ice of the polar regions, carried out of the Polar Circle, and heated by the ground. Glaciers from the mountains would dissolve and inundate the valleys. In higher and in temperate latitudes the falling snow would turn to water or even vapor before reaching the ground or soon thereafter. For many months and probably years, the snow falling on the ground would, melt and run in great streams to the sea, cutting new river channels and carrying off great masses of debris. Falling again and again in a sunless world, the snow, shielded from the sun's rays by thick clouds enveloping the earth, would finally cool the ground to the point where it would turn, not into water, but into ice. At first this ice would not lie firmly on the ground; from inclines and slopes it would slide down to the deeper valleys and then toward the sea. Large icebergs would fill the sea and, tossing about, melt and drop a load of stones or other"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"126 Axis SHIFTED detrital material to the bottom; other icebergs, floating over valleys filled with water, would deposit their loads there. In the course of the years the incessant action of the snow would cool the ground in the higher latitudes to such an extent that a permanent cover would be built. And the earth would go on shuddering for centuries, slowly quieting down, and as time passed one after an- other the volcanoes would burn themselves out. This catastrophic shifting of the axis, once or a number of times, is presented here only as a working hypothesis but, without exception, all its potential effects have actually taken place. Assuming now that the working hypothesis is wrong, we are faced with the necessity of finding a special ex- planation for each and every phenomenon observed.

These causes, however, are inadequate to explain the great revolutions in nature, and they evoke expressions of futility on the part of the specialists, each in his field. Ice and Tide Having shown that only global catastrophes could have brought about the building and spreading of ice covers, I shall now go on to demonstrate that many effects at- tributed to ice were caused not by it but by onrushing water. The simplicity with which cosmic catastrophes can explain the origin of the continental ice covers should not make us uncritical. The same catastrophes caused great tides to rush over continents. Both phenomena waves of translation and ice covers took place. Tidal waves traversed continents, moving by inertia when the daily rotation of the earth was disturbed; the ocean water also retreated from the equatorial to the polar regions, returning to the equator with the adjustment of the diurnal rotation. These tidal waves, augmented by others produced by the extraneous fields of force, and by tides generated by submarine earthquakes and hurricanes, were the main agents that dispersed erratic boulders, dis- tributed marine sediment over the land, covered the ground with drift. Invasions of the land by the sea, tor- rential rains, prodigious snowfalls, floods caused by the melting ice cover, and multitudinous icebergs sliding into the sea, all contributed to the readjustment of the mantle of the earth, shifting the sea-floor sand, the disintegrating rock, the lava, the volcanic and meteoric dust and ashes. The arctic lands were denuded and their detachable mantle was washed away; thus was formed the barren stone surface of the Canadian Shield, its soil being car- ried away as drift. The erosion and drift, the excavation of lakes and valleys, and their filling in with clay, boulders, and sand have been ascribed to ice that eroded and moved the debris along. The opponents of the Ice Age theory, the last of which is George McCready Price, pointed to the effect of the ice cover in Antarctica on the rocks beneath: ice"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"128 Axis SHIFTED plays there a protective and not an eroding role; it shields the underlying rock from the erosive action of the elements and especially of the high velocity winds that blow most of the year in this part of the world. Yet in rapid motion, with many stone fragments and other debris under it, ice could scratch the bedrock and erode and flute the slopes of valleys. But it is doubtful that the weight of the ice would excavate lake basins in cold, hard rock. The ground was heated, lava gushed out of the earth, formations were softened, and oceans, pouring water and stones on rock and lava, made deep impres- sions in them. When, after the mountainous ice cover was formed, the ground in a new paroxysm gushed lava under the ice, the latter steamed and, subsiding, pressed with a great weight on the softened ground; in this man- ner, too, ice could excavate beds of lakes and leave other deep marks on the ground it once covered. Before the Ice Age theory was conceived, drift and erratic boulders were ascribed to the action of great tidal waves. But with the advent of this theory the role of water in the deposition of drift and erratic boulders was denied. \"Gigantic waves,\" wrote J. Geikie, \"were supposed to have precipitated upon the land, and then swept madly on over mountain and valley alike, carrying along with them a mighty burden of rocks and stones and rubbish.\" l This view assumed, however, \"the former existence of a cause which there was little hi nature to warrant.\" A late opponent of the Ice Age theory, Sir Henry H. Howorth (1842-1923), sought the origin of such tidal waves in a sudden rise of a mountain chain or in an earthquake of the oceanic bottom. 2 As we have learned o preceding pages, a disturbance in the axial rotation of the earth must have created a dis- placement of the oceans and their irruption on land; and this very cause the disturbance in the axial rotation of the earth must have acted also in order to build the continental ice covers; it also changed the profile of the earth's crust, lifting some mountains and leveling others. All this created scenes of the utmost complexity. An example is the old but not antiquated description of the Northeastern United States from Maine to Michigan and 1 J.

We are beset with difficulties when we attempt to solve the problem presented by the Northern Drift in Northeastern America. . . . Extreme complexity in the direction of the striation; proof of the former presence of the sea over a part of the region, and of fresh water over another extensive portion; enormous accumulations of detrital material evidently deposited by water; occasional peculiar transportation of boulders in a manner not in harmony with anything we see ice doing at the present time; occurrence of linear accumulations of sand gravel, and boulders closely resembling the osar [Scandinavian crests of drift] in character; proofs in some parts of the Drift region of the prevalence during the Glacial epoch of a colder climate, and in others of one warmer than that now existing these are some of the difficulties which must be met by those who undertake to solve the problem of the Northern Drift of Northeastern America.\" 8 The theories of warm interglacial periods and of the deformation of land and its submersion as the result of the removal of the ice cover could explain the puzzling phenomena hi some cases, but in many others they could not do so. Thus bones of seal and walrus are found in Holderness, Yorkshire, with fresh-water mollusks of warm climate. \"Despite its anomalous elements, the deposit is classed as interglacial.\" 4 In similar strata in Yorkshire hippopotami are found, too. The glaciers in the Alps served as observational material for deductions concerning the continental ice cover. How- ever, alpine glaciers carry stones downhill, not uphill, and the general question was asked whether ice could carry rocks uphill. 5 Erratic boulders are often found in places where conti- nental ice could hardly have deposited them. Charles Darwin inquired and learned that erratics are found on the Azores, islands separated from the ice cover by a wide expanse of ocean. a J. D.

As already said, in India, in an earlier ice age, detritus and blocks were carried, not from the land toward the sea, but in the opposite direc- tion, from the sea up the Himalayas, and not from higher latitudes toward lower, but in the opposite direction. The whales in the hills of Vermont and Quebec were cast there by an irrupting ocean. The very profusion of erratic boulders in many places of the world, sometimes covering wide stretches of a country, whether carried by ice or by tides, presents the problem of their origin: they must have been broken off the mountains in great numbers at a time when ice and water were thrown into action. The mountains must have been under stress, the massifs must have been heated and split, or shattered by earthquakes; they must have been mashed and twisted and rent when the seas trespassed their borders and carried their billows to mountainous ridges, red and bursting. Magnetic Poles Reversed When rock is liquefied it is non-magnetic but, cooling to about 580 Centigrade (Curie point), it acquires a magnetic state and orientation dependent upon the mag- netic field of the earth. After solidifying, lava rock retains its magnetic property, and it would retain it even though it became displaced or the magnetic orientation of the earth changed. In all parts of the globe rock formations are found with reversed polarization; l paleomagnetism almost every month detects more areas of inverted orientation. \"Suf- ficient experiments have now been made to allow only one plausible explanation of this 'inverted' magnetization that the Earth's magnetic field was itself reversed at the 8 J.

Lava or igneous rock, on cooling below the Curie point, acquires a magnetic charge stronger than the charge this rock would acquire in the same magnetic field at outdoor temperature, but only doubly so. 4 The rocks with inverted polarity, however, are magnetically charged ten times and often up to a hundred times stronger than they could have been by terrestrial magnetism. \"This is one of the most astonishing problems of paleomagnetism, and is not yet fully explained, although the facts are well attested.\" 6 Thus we are confronted with an ever-growing puzzle. The cause of the reversal of the magnetic field in the rocks of the earth is unknown and the fact contradicts every cosmological theory. The strength of magnetization of the rocks with inverted polarity is astonishing. Now, if the earth's axis changed its direction or position under the influence of an external magnetic field, we should expect to find the following: The external magnetic field would create eddy (electri- cal) currents in the surface layers of the earth; the cur- rents would create a magnetic field around the earth that would counteract the external magnetic field. The strength of the magnetic field created by the eddy cur- rents would be dependent on the external magnetic field and the velocity with which the earth traveled through it. The thermal effect of the electrical currents would liquefy the rocks. The process would be accompanied by volcanic activity and intrusion of igneous rock into surface sedi- mentary rocks.

It is also apparent that an external magnetic field that could shift the terrestrial axis in a short time would have to be of considerable intensity. We have all three expected effects: lava flowed and igneous rock intruded in the form of dykes or otherwise; the heated rocks acquired a reversed magnetic orientation; the intensity of their magnetization is stronger than the earth's own field could possibly produce. In the section \"A Working Hypothesis,\" it was asserted that the formation of the ice cover, pluvial phenomena, and mountain building could be explained if the earth's axis was shifted, and it was assumed that the axis was shifted by an extraneous magnetic field. Now, the cir- cumstance that rocks the world over show reversed mag- netic orientation and an intensity of magnetization which the earth's magnetic field could not have induced, proves that our assumption was not unfounded. In a recent article, S. K. Runcorn of the University of Cambridge reports that \"the evidence accumulates that the earth did reverse its field many times.*' * \"The north and south geomagnetic poles reversed places several times ... the field would suddenly break up and reform with opposite polarity.\" The source of the terrestrial magnetism is supposed to be in electrical currents on the surface of the terrestrial core. \"Substantial changes in the speed of earth's rotation become easier to explain. \"Whatever the mechanism [of the origin of the ter- restrial magnetic field], there seems no doubt that the earth's field is tied up in some way with the rotation of the planet. And this leads to a remarkable finding about the earth's rotation itself.\" The unavoidable conclusion, according to Runcorn, is that \"the earth's axis of rotation has changed also. In other words, the planet has rolled about, changing the location of its geographical poles.\" He charted the various positions of the north geographical pole. The next question, then, is: When was the terrestrial magnetic field reversed for the last time?

The observation was made on clay fired in kilns by the Etruscans and Greeks. The position of the ancient vases during firing is known. They were fired in a standing position, as the flow of the glaze testifies. The magnetic inclination or the magnetic dip of the iron particles in the fired clay indicates which was the nearest magnetic pole, the south or the north. In 1896 Giuseppe Folgheraiter began his careful studies of Attic (Greek) and Etruscan vases of various centuries, starting with the eighth century before the present era. His conclusion was that in the eighth century the earth's mag- netic field was inverted in Italy and Greece. 7 Italy and Greece were closer to the south than to the north mag- netic pole. P. L.

But check- ing on the method and the results of Folgheraiter, Mer- canton found them perfect. An ancient vase found by F. A. Forel in Boiron de Morges, on Lake Geneva, was broken and its pieces were scattered and lay in all directions; when assembled, they all showed one and the same magnetic orientation, which proves again that the magnetic field of the earth was un- able to change the orientation originally acquired by the clay when fired and cooled in the kiln. 8 These researches, continued and described in a series of papers by Professor Mercanton, presently with the Service Meteorologique Universitaire in Lausanne, show that the magnetic field of the earth, not very different from what it is today, was disturbed sometime during or immediately 7 G.

Volcanoes, Earthquakes, Comets A great chain of volcanoes girdles the Pacific Ocean. The Andes in South America are studded with many vol- canic summits, among them the loftiest volcanic moun- tains in the world: Cotopaxi in Ecuador is over 19,000 feet high. The Andes reached their present height only in the age of modern man. Magma intruded into the rock and lifted it; in many places magma reached the surface, broke through vents, and built craters. Most of those volcanoes, however, are already extinct. Central America abounds in volcanoes, most of them extinct or dormant; the highest, Orizaba in Mexico, over 18,000 feet high, was active for the last time three cen- turies ago. In the United States few volcanoes are active, though many became extinct very recently, in the geo- logical sense. Alaska, the Aleutian Islands, the Kam- chatka Peninsula, and the Kurile Islands encircle the northern Pacific with a volcanic arc. The Japanese islands contain volcanoes by the score; most of them are extinct, some only recently so. Formosa, the Philippines, the so- called Volcano Islands one of which is Iwo Jima the Moluccas, northern New Zealand, the Sunda Archipelago all are crowded with volcanoes, most of them only re- cently extinct.

The Indian Ocean from Java, an island full of vol- canoes, extinct, dormant, and active, to Kilimanjaro, an extinct volcano over 19,000 feet high in East Africa, is circled with volcanoes and its bottom is of lava, with several volcanic isles in the middle of it. Along the Ara- bian coast of the Red Sea stretches a long chain of vol- canoes; the numerous craters are all extinct, but it is not so long ago that they became inactive, the last eruptions having taken place in the year 1222 at Killis in northern Syria and in 1253 at Aden.' In the Mediterranean region Thera (Santorin), which exploded with unusual force about 1500, is still active or dormant; Etna on Sicily, a snow-capped volcano, Stromboli, and Vulcano are active. On the mainland of Europe, however, the only active volcano left is Vesuvius. In the past France and the British Isles saw extensive vol- canic activity, and though this activity is ascribed to the Tertiary, some of \"the cones, craters, and lava-streams [in France] . , . stand out so fresh that they might almost 1 Daly, Our Mobile Earth, p. 91. 2 Monte, Arabien, Studien zur physikalischen und historischen Geo- graphie des Landes, p. 12."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"136 Axis SHIFTED be supposed to have been erupted ony a few generations ago,\" in the words of Sir Archibald Geikie. 3 Iceland in the North Atlantic has 107 volcanoes on it and thousands of craters, large and small; none of the volcanoes is geologically ancient, but many of them are extinct. The island is covered with coagulated lava, fis- sures, and crater formations. Iceland is one of the rare places where in modern times lava streams have been vomited from fissures in the earth without a crater having been formed. From Iceland down the Atlantic, the Azores, the Canary Islands, the Cape Verde Islands, Ascension, and St. Helena are volcanic islands, some of them thrust up from the bottom of the ocean; their volcanic activity, like the activity of the many known volcanoes on the bottom of the Atlantic, has ceased. In Patagonia volcanic eruptions have occurred down to fairly recent times, and the land between the Atlantic and the Andes is covered in many places with lava flows. All in all only about four or five hundred volcanoes on earth are considered active or dormant, against a mul- tiplicity of extinct cones. Yet only five or six hundred years ago many of the presently inactive volcanoes were still active. This points to very great activity at a time only a few thousand years ago. At the rate of extinction witnessed by modern man, the greater part of the still active volcanoes will become inactive in a matter of sev- eral centuries. The cause of volcanic activity is supposed to be in movements and fractures of the outer crust of the earth, \"however these may be brought about, a matter as yet by no means settled.\" The coincidence in time and place of mountain folding and volcano building is regarded as significant for the solution of the problem of the origin of volcanoes. Seas of lava and crater formations cover the entire face of the moon. \"No one who has observed the moon, even through a relatively small telescope, can forget this pic- ture of tremendous catastrophe: a flood of molten lava that has engulfed . . . and obliterated craters and moun- tain ridges in its path.*' 4 Whether the crater formations 8 A.

The theory of uniformity can be taught only on moonless nights. As with the volcanic activity, the seismic shocks, judged by their effects, must have been of a very different order of magnitude in the past. \"The earthquakes of the present day,\" writes Eduard Suess in his The Face of the Earth (Das Antlitz der Erde), \"are certainly but faint reminiscences of those telluric movements to which the structure of almost every mountain range bears witness.

Chamberlin, \"Hundreds, if not thousands, of cubic miles of the body of the earth almost instantaneously heaved upward produced a violent earth- quake which spread . . . throughout the entire globe.

The theory of Alexis Perrey, regularly quoted in text- books, connects the occurrence of earthquakes in our time with the position of the nearest celestial body, the moon. Earth tremors occur more often when the moon is full or when the earth is between the sun and the moon; when the moon is new, or when it is between the sun and the earth; when the moon crosses the meridian of the afflicted locality; and when the moon is closest to the earth on its orbit. With the possible exception of the fourth case, the statistics for the last century appear to support Perrey's theory. But if this statistical theory is correct, then we have to look to the celestial sphere for the stresses that are relieved in earthquakes; and the far- ther in time from the stresses, the less numerous and less violent are the shocks. Finally, a third natural phenomenon shows a definite downward curve. The number of comets visible to the un- aided eye in recent centuries is only a small fraction of the number of cometary bodies that were observed in the historical past, in comparable periods of time. Whereas in our age about three comets are seen without the help of a telescope in the Northern Hemisphere in a century, in the days of imperial Rome, nineteen centuries ago, comets were so frequent that they were associated with many state events, such as the beginning of the rule of an emperor, his wars, his death. Often more than one comet was seen simultaneously. Some of the comets were spectacular and glowed even in the daytime. Approaching the sun, a comit emits a tail consisting of gases and dust particles. It is believed that these tails are wasted and that their material does not return to the head. A comet that recurs every seventy-six years, as Halley's comet does, would have to grow and lose its tail T Pliny. Natural History (trans.

But these ways, especially the last two, cannot be profitably applied for measuring time in thousands or tens of thousands of years; they were devised for reckon- ing time in millions of years. Of the methods used to find how much time has passed since the ice cover started to melt, the \"varve\" method, until recently, was thought to be fairly precise. This method was introduced by G. de Gcer, who counted the annual bands of silt and clay (\"varves\") deposited, coarse in summer and fine hi winter, under the ice in the coastal lakes and rivers of Sweden, once covered by the glacial sheet of the Ice Age. De Geer calculated that it had taken about 5000 years to melt the ice cover from Schonen, at the southern tip of Sweden, to the place in the north where there are still glaciers in the mountains. In no place are there five thousand overlying varves; but De Geer looked for similar series or patterns of thick and thin varves from one lake to another, about fifteen hundred outcrops altogether, always with the thought that a varve series found high in the deposit of some southern lake would repeat itself closer to the bottom of a lake to the north. Additional figures used in De Geer's evaluation of the time that passed since the end of the Ice Age are of a more hypothetical nature. For the preceding period, the time allegedly needed for the ice to retreat all the way, from Leipzig to southern Sweden, where no varves are found, De Geer offered, as a surmise, a span of 4000 years. Then he surmised further that the end of the melt- ing of the ice cover coincided with the beginning of Neo- lithic time, which he placed 5000 years ago, thus arriving at the final figure of 14,000 years, or 12,000 years before the present era. The area of Stockholm was freed from ice about 10,000 years ago.

De Geer applied his method of identifying synchronical varves to countries as far apart as Sweden, Central Asia, and South America. His telechronology was objected to on the ground that a dry phase in Scandinavia may not necessarily have coincided with a dry phase in the Hima- layas or in the Andes, and that therefore the telechronology was built on an erroneous assumption. 2 But the method as applied to northern Europe or North America was hailed as a most exact geological time clock. The summing up of varves from one dried-out lake to another is a delicate process and often subjective appraisals replace an objective method; especially arbitrary are the estimates for inter- vening stretches of land where no varves are found. In 1947 an ingenious new method of investigating the age of organic remains was developed by W. F. Libby of the University of Chicago. The radiocarbon dating method is based on the fact that when cosmic rays hit the upper atmosphere they break the nitrogen atoms into hydrogen (H) and radiocarbon (di), or carbon with two extra electrons, therefore unstable, or radioactive. The radiocarbon is mixed with the atmospheric carbon and as carbon dioxide it is absorbed by plants; it enters the animal body that feeds on plants and also the carni- vore that feeds on other animals. Thus all animal and plant cells as long as they live contain approximately the same amount of radiocarbon; when death comes, no new radiocarbon is assimilated and the radiocarbon present in the remains undergoes the process of decay, as every radioactive substance does. After 5568 years only half of the radiocarbon remains; after another 5568-year period only half of the half, or a quarter of the original 1 Chamberlln, in The World and Man, ed.

A sample under- going analysis a piece of wood or skin is bur.ned to ashes and its radiocarbon content is determined by a Geiger counter. This method claims accuracy for or- ganic objects between 1000 and 20,000 years old; bones and shells are unsuitable materials because organic carbon is easily lost in the process of fossilization, often being replaced by carbon in ground water and by mineral salts. The first important result of the radiocarbon dating method in glacial chronology was a radical reduction of the terminal date of the Ice Age. It was shown that ice, instead of retreating 30,000 years ago, was still advanc- ing 10,000 or 11,000 years ago. 8 This conflicts strongly with the figures arrived at by the varve method concern- ing the final phase of the Ice Age in North America. 4 Even this great reduction of the date of the end of the Ice Age is not final. Radiocarbon analysis, according to Professor Frederick Johnson, chairman of the committee for selection of samples for analysis, 5 revealed \"puzzling exceptions.\" In numerous cases the shortening of the time schedule was so great that, as the only recourse, Libby assumed a \"contamination\" by radiocarbon. But in many other cases \"the reason for the discrepancies cannot be explained.\" Altogether the method indicates that \"geo- logical developments were speedier than formerly sup- posed.\" e H. E. Suess of the United States Geological Survey re- ported recently that wood found at the base of inter- bedded blue till, peat, and outwash of drift, and ascribed by its finder to the Late Wisconsin (last) glaciation, is, according to radiocarbon analysis, but 3300 years old (with a margin of error up to two hundred years both ways), or of the middle of the second millennium before the present era.

Professor Johnson says: \"There is no way at the moment to prove whether the valid dates, the 'invalid ones,' or the 'present ideas' are in error.\" 8 He says also: \"Until the number of measurements can be increased to a point permitting some explanation of contradictions with other apparently trustworthy data, it is necessary to continue to form judg- ments concerning validity by a combination of all avail- able information.\" With this idea in mind, I offer in the following sections a review of the results of several other methods of time measurement, especially as regards the dating of the last glaciation. Libby recognizes that the exactness of his method is dependent on two assumptions. The first is that for the last 20,000 or 30,000 years the amount of cosmic radia- tion reaching our atmosphere remained constant; the other is that the quantity of water in the oceans has not changed in the same period of time. Actually only a minor part of the radiocarbon created by cosmic rays is absorbed by plants and animals, the so-called biosphere; a still smaller part is present in the atmosphere; the larg- est share is absorbed by the ocean. Libby stressed the significance of these factors. It tran- spires that if there were cosmic catastrophes in the past cosmic radiation could have reached the earth at a different intensity; and in a future book I intend to show that the waters of the oceans and their salts were in- creased substantially in a recent geological age. Bearing in mind these limitations, I confidently expect that in the field of geology more and more \"puzzling\" results of radiocarbon tests will compel a full-scale re- vision of the dating of the glacial periods. 9 7 Science, September 24, 1954, and April 8, 1955. 8 Johnson in Libby, Radiocarbon Dating, p. 106. $ In the field of archaeology, I expect the radiocarbon tests to confirm that the time of the Eighteenth Dynasty in Egypt must be reduced by five to six hundred years, and the time of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties by a full seven hundred years, as I maintain in Ages in Chaos."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"THE GLACIAL LAKE AGASSIZ 145 The Glacial Lake Agassiz Lake Agassiz, the largest glacial lake of North Amer- ica, once covered the region at present occupied by Lake Winnipeg, Lake Manitoba, a number of other lakes in Canada, and parts of the North Central States of the United States. It exceeded the aggregate area of the five Great Lakes tributary to the St. Lawrence River. It was formed when the ice of North America melted. Study of its sediment, however, disclosed that its entire duration had been definitely less than one thousand years, a mea- sure of time unexpectedly short; this indicates also that the glacial cover melted under catastrophic conditions. Warren Upham, the American glaciologist, wrote: \"The geologic suddenness of the final melting of the ice-sheet, proved by the brevity of existence of its attendant glacial lakes, presents scarcely less difficulty for explanation of its causes and climatic conditions than the earlier changes from mild and warm preglacial conditions to prolonged cold and ice accumulation.\" l Not only was the .life of the glacial Lake Agassiz measured in hundreds of years and the melting of the continental ice cover that gave rise to this lake of short duration but this melting must have taken place only re- cently: the erosion on the shores of Lake Agassiz indi- cates that it existed only a short time ago. Upham also recognized that the shoreline of the extinct lake is not horizontal, which indicates that the warping too occurred recently. Although this study of Lake Agassiz by Upham is over fifty years old, its conclusions have never been challenged. He also stated: \"Another indication that the final melting of the ice sheet upon British America was separated by only a very short interval, geologically speaking, from the present time is seen in the wonderfully perfect preservation of the glacial striation and polishing on the surface of the more enduring rocks. ... It seems impossible that these rock exposures can have so well withstood weathering in the severe climate of those northern regions longer than a few thousand years at the most.\" 2 1 Warren Upham, The Glacial Lake Agassiz (1895), p. 240. 2 Ibid., p. 239."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"146 THIRTY-FIVE CENTURIES AGO Upham realized and stressed that \"these measures of time\" are \"surprisingly short, whether we compare them on the one hand with the period of authentic human history or on the other hand with the long record of geol- ogy.\" How it started, how it ended all appears enigmatic; what is clear is that great changes took place but a few thousand years ago, under catastrophic conditions. Niagara Falls When Lyell, on his trip to the United States, visited Niagara Falls, he talked with someone who lived in the vicinity and was told that the falls retreat about three feet a year. Since the natives of a country are likely to exag- gerate, Lyell announced that one foot per annum would be a better figure. From this he concluded that over thirty-five thousand years were necessary, from the time the land was freed from the ice cover and the falls started their work of erosion, to cut the gorge from Queenston to the place it occupied in the year of Lyell 's visit. Since then this figure has often been mentioned in textbooks as the length of time from the end of the glacial period. The date of the end of the Ice Age was not changed when v subsequent examination of records indicated that since 1764 the falls had retreated from Lake Ontario to- ward Lake Erie at the rate of five feet per year, and that, if the process of wearing down the rock had gone on at the same rate from the time of the retreat of the ice cover, seven thousand years would have been sufficient to do the work. However, since hi the beginning, when the ice melted and a swollen stream carried the detritus abrading the rock of the gorge, the erosion rate must have been much more rapid, the age of the gorge must be further reduced. According to G. F. Wright, author of The Ice Age in North America, five thousand years may be regarded as an adequate figure. 1 The erosion and sedi- mentation of the shores of Lake Michigan also suggest a lapse of time reckoned in thousands, but not tens of 1 G.

R. F. Flint of Yale writes: \"We are obliged to fall back on the Upper Great Gorge, the uppermost segment of the whole gorge, which appears to be genuinely postglacial. Redeterminations by W. H.

Hence the age of the Upper Great Gorge is cal- culated as somewhat more than four thousand years and to obtain even this [low] figure we have to assume that the rate of recession has been constant, although we know that discharge has in fact varied greatly during post- glacial times.\" 4 Jt due allowance is made for this last factor, the age of the Upper Great Gorge of Niagara Falls would be somewhere between 2500 and 3500 years. It follows that the ice retreated in historical times, some- where between the years 1500 and 500 before the present era.

F. A. Forel, another Swiss naturalist, undertook an evaluation of the detrital mud deposited by the Rhone Glacier on the bottom of Lake Geneva. He arrived at a figure close to twelve thousand years as the span of time necessary for the mud and detritus to have been deposited on the bottom of the lake, or from the height of the Ice Age to the present. Forel's result actually signifies that the Rhone Glacier, which feeds the river and the lake, is evidence of the short duration of the post-glacial period, or even of the entire Ice Age if the origin of the lake goes back to the first glacial period. These estimates, when announced, were much lower than expected. The eminent French geologist of the beginning of this century, and a colleague of Heim and Forel, A. Cochon de Lapparent, arrived at an even more radical result. In the time of its greatest expansion, the Rhone Glacier reached from Valais to Lyons. De Lapparent took the average figure of progression as seen today on larger glaciers. Mer de Glace, a glacier on Mont Blanc, moves fifty centimeters in twenty-four hours. Moving at a com- parative velocity, the Rhone Glacier, when expanding, would have required 2475 years to progress from Valais to Lyons. Then, comparing the terminal moraines, or stone and detritus accumulation, of several present-day glaciers with the moraines left by the Rhone Glacier at its maximum expansion, De Lapparent again arrived at a figure of about 2400 years. He also concluded that the entire Ice Age was of very short duration. To this another geologist, Albrecht Penck, objected. 1 His objection was based not on a disproval of the above figures, but on a claim that great evolutionary changes took place during the consecutive interglacial periods. The divergence of opinion between them was so great that hundreds of thousands of years in Penck's scheme were reduced to mere thousands of years in De Lapparent's calculations. Penck estimated the duration of the Ice Age, with its four glacial and three interglacial periods, as one million years. Each of the four glaciations and deglaciations must have consumed one hundred thousand years and more. The 1A.

Carl Schuchardt, in his book, Alteuropa, warned his colleagues not to turn deaf ears to voices like that of De Lapparent. Let us assume that the geological processes were always as they are now. In Ehringsdorf near Weimar there is a tufa layer in which, during the entire last inter- glacial period, calcium was deposited. \"But should we even assume all kinds of imaginable causes that would have retarded the deposition of calcium so as to make it ten times as slow as at present, still we would have only 3000 years and not 100,000!\" 2 If we follow the principle of quantitative analysis and accept De Lapparent's figure as approximately correct, the maximal extension of the Rhone Glacier dates from a point well within the bounds of human history. The recent field work in the Alps actually revealed that numerous glaciers there are no older than 4000 years. This startling discovery made the following state- ment necessary: \"A large number of the present glaciers in the Alps are not survivors of the last glacial maximum, as was formerly universally believed, but are glaciers newly created within roughly the last 4000 years.\" 3 The Mississippi , The Mississippi carries yearly in its stream many bil- lions of tons of detritus, a large part of which is de- posited in the delta. As early as 1861, Humphreys and Abbot calculated the age of the Mississippi by evaluating the detritus borne by it and the sediment deposited in the delta. They arrived at the low figure of 5000 years as the age of the delta, its birth thus being related to about the year 2800 before the present era. 1 However, when at 2 Alteuropa (1929), p. 16; Idem, Vorgeschichte von Deutschland (1943), p. 3. 3 Flint, Glacial Geology, p. 491.

It is assumed that when the continental ice started to melt and the Great Lakes became swollen, but the St. Lawrence was still blocked by ice, the water of the basin emptied to a great extent into the Gulf of Mexico through the Mississippi. The Falls of St. Anthony on this stream at Minneapolis have excavated a long gorge by removing the bedrock. In the 1870s and 1880s N. H. Winchell made this falls the subject of a study. Comparing topographical maps covering two hundred years, he concluded that the falls had retreated 2.44 feet yearly. If this was the constant rate of retreat, the falls must have started 8000 years ago. 2 But here, too, a larger stream carrying abundant detritus, which abraded the bedrock, must have flowed when the ice cover melted. J. D. Dana, studying the area of Lake Champlain and of the Northeastern states in gen- eral, came to the conclusion that prodigious floods of almost unimaginable magnitude accompanied the melting of the ice cover: in the lower part of the Connecticut River the floods rose two hundred feet above the present high-water mark. 8 And if this is true for those regions, it must be true also for the valley of the Mississippi. Con- sequently the gorge of the Falls of St. Anthony must be of more recent date than Winchell calculated, though even his figure was regarded as much too low. The protracted discussion of the results derived from the exploration of Niagara and St. Anthony falls demon- strated the need for yet another area of investigation, preferably the delta of a stream fed by a still existing glacier that could be carefully studied. For that purpose the delta of the Bear River was selected (a stream from a melting glacier that enters the Portland Canal on the Alaska-British Columbia border). On the basis of three earlier accurate surveys made between the years 1909 and 1927, G. Hanson in 1934 calculated with great ex- actness the annual growth of the delta through deposited 2 Minnesota Geologic and Natural History Survey for 1876 (1877), pp. 175-89. 8 G. F.

At the present rate of sedimentation the delta is estimated to be \"only 3600 years old.\" 4 The glacier that feeds the Bear River was formed and began to melt in the middle of the second millennium before the pres- ent era. Fossils in Florida On the Atlantic coast of Florida, at Vero in the Indian River region, in 1915 and 1916, human remains were found in association with the bones of Ice Age (Pleisto- cene) animals, many of which either became extinct, like the saber-toothed tiger, or have disappeared from the Americas, like the camel. The find caused immediate excitement among geologists and anthropologists. Beside the human bones pottery was found, as well as bone implements and worked stone. Ales Hrdlicka, of the Smithsonian Institution of Wash- ington, D.C., a renowned anthropologist (who generally opposed the view that man existed in America in the Ice Age), wrote that the \"advanced state of culture, such as that shown by the pottery, bone implements, and worked stone brought from a considerable distance, im- plies a numerous population spread over large areas, ac- quainted thoroughly with fire, with cooking food, and with all the usual primitive arts\"; the human remains and relics could not be of an antiquity \"comparable with that of fossil remains with which they are associated.\" 1 He also published the opinion of W. H. Holmes, head curator of the Department of Anthropology of the United States National Museum, who investigated the pottery obtained by Hrdlicka from Vero. These were bowls \"such as were in common use among the Indian tribes of Florida.\" When compared with vessels from Florida earth mounds, \"no significant distinction can be made; in material, thick- ness of walls, finish of rim, surface finish, color, state of preservation, and size and shape,\" the v^sels \"are iden- 4 O.

The discoverer of the Vero deposits, E. H. Sellards, state geologist of Florida and a very capable paleontologist, wrote in the debate that ensued: \"That the human bones are fossils normal to this stratum and contemporaneous with the associated verte- brates is determined by their place in the formation, their manner of occurrence, their intimate relation to the bones of other animals, and the degree of mineralization of the bones.\" This \"degree of mineralization of the human bones is identical with that of the associated bones of the other animals.\" In his view the evidence obtained \"affords proof that man reached America at an early date and was present on the continent in association with a Pleistocene flee Age] fauna.\" 2 Anthropologists of the Hrdlicka school would not accept this, claiming a late arrival of man on the American continent, and the presence of pottery was hi their view proof of a late date for the human bones. The human skulls, though fossilized, did not differ from the skulls of the Indians of today. In 1923-29, thirty-three miles north of Vero, in Mel- bourne, Florida, another such association of human re- mains and extinct animals was found, \"a remarkably rich assemblage of animal bones, many of which represent species which became extinct at or after the close of the Pleistocene [Ice Age] epoch.\" 8 The discoverer, J. W. Gidley, of the United States National Museum, established unequivocally that in Melbourne as in Vero the human bones were of the same stratum and in the same state of fossilization as the bones of the extinct animals. And again human artifacts were found with the bones.

All these and other considerations of an anthropological as well as geological nature, being summed up, prove, in the opinion of I. Rouse, a recent analyst of the much- debated fossils of Florida, that \"the Vero and Mel- bourne man should have been in existence between 2000 B.C. and the year zero A.D.\" 4 This does not solve the problem of the association of extinct animals and man who lived between two and four thousand years ago, in the second and first millennia before the present era. There is no proper way out of this dilemma, other than the assumption that now extinct animals still existed in historical times and that the catastrophe which over- whelmed man and animals and annihilated numerous species occurred in the second or first millennium before the present era. The geologists are right: the human remains and arti- facts of Vero and Melbourne in Florida are of the same age as the fossils of the extinct animals. The anthropologists are equally right: the human re- mains and artifacts are of the second or first millennium before the present era. What follows? It follows that the extinct animals be- longed to the recent past. It follows also that some par- oxysm of nature heaped together these assemblages; the same paroxysm of nature may have destroyed numerous species so that they became extinct. Lakes of the Great Basin and the End of the Ice Age The Sierra Nevada chain rises between the Great Basin to the east and the Pacific, cutting off the drainage to the ocean. Abert and Summer lakes in southern Oregon have no outlets. They are regarded as remnants of a once large glacial lake, Chewaucan. W. van Winkle of the United States Geological Survey investigated the saline content of these two lakes and wrote: \"A conservative es- timate of the age of Summer and Abert Lakes, based on 4 1.

Startled at his own result, Van Winkle conjectured that salt deposits of the early Chewau- can Lake may be hidden beneath the bottom sediments of the present Abert and Summer lakes. To the east of Sequoia National Park and Mount Whitney in California lies Owens Lake. It is supplied by the Owens River and it has no outlet. At some time in the past the surface level of the lake, because of a greater water supply, was so much higher that it overflowed its basin. H. S. Gale analyzed the water of the lake and of the river for chlorine and sodium and came to the con- clusion that the river required 4200 years to supply the chlorine present in the lake and 3500 years to supply its sodium. Ellsworth Huntington of Yale found these figures too high, because no allowance was made for greater rain- fall and \"freshening of the lake\" in the past, and con- sequently he reduced the age of the lake to 2500 years, which would place its origin not far from the middle of the first millennium before the present era. 2 Another vast lake of the past without an outlet to the sea was Lake Lahontan in the Great Basin of Nevada, which covered an area of 8500 square miles. As its water level fell, it split up into a number of lakes divided by a desert terrain. In the 1880s I. Russell of the United States Geological Survey investigated Lake Lahontan and its basin, and established that the lake was never completely dried out and that the present-day Pyramid and Winne- mucca lakes north of Reno and Walker Lake southwest of it are the residuals of the older and larger lake. 8 He concluded that Lake Lahontan existed during the Ice Age and was contemporaneous with the different stages of glaciation of that age. He also found bones of Ice Age animals in the deposits of the ancient lake. More recently, Lahontan and its residual lakes were 1 Walton van Winkle, \"Quality of the Surface Waters of Oregon,\" U. S.

But these conclusions require that the age of the mam- mals of the Ice Age, found in the deposits of Lake La- hontan, be not greater than that of the lake. This means that the Ice Age ended only twenty-five to thirty-nine cen- turies ago. Jones checked the figures obtained from the rate of accumulation of chlorine and sodium as brought in by the Truckee River, with other methods, such as the accumulation of chlorine in lakes during the thirty-one years that had passed since the analysis made by Russell, and also the rate of concentration of salts by evaporation, and each time reached the result that the entire history of Pyramid and Winnemucca lakes \"is within the last 3000 years.\" 8 Bones of horses, elephants, and camels, animals that became extinct in the Americas, were found in the La- hontan sediments, as well as a spear point of human manufacture. 6 When a branch of the Southern Pacific Railroad was laid through Astor Pass, a large gravel pit of Lahontan age was opened, and J.

Then, in 1910, at the International Geological Con- gress in Stockholm, facts were placed before the scientists that demonstrated great changes and catastrophic fluctua- tions in the climate of the earth in the past few thousand years. Since that congress many works have been written to describe the climatic as well as geological changes that occurred in this recent time. In many places the present land was covered by sea and the present sea was land. For instance, from the changes in the mollusk popula- tion of the seas and the tree population of the submerged forests, it was concluded that the North and the Baltic seas assumed their present shapes during the Recent pe- riod.

The second climatic catastrophe of the Recent period took place in the century following the year 800, a time period that is well within recorded history. 'The beginning of the *period of unchanging climate' has advanced later and later before the attacks of geologists, and now, in the minds of most of the authors who concern themselves with the subject, it apparently stands only a few cen- turies before Christ.\" 8 The new understanding originated with Axel Blytt, a Norwegian scientist who began his work in the seventies of the last century. Gunnar Andersson and Rutger Ser- nander, also Scandinavian scientists, carried on the work that Blytt started. Thus it happened that Scandinavia and the surrounding seas were investigated first. In Scandinavia the last Klimasturz marked the end of the Bronze Age. The following centuries offer a picture of desolation and wretchedness attributed to the altered climate, \"Opulent plenty\" was followed by \"striking pov- erty.\" 4 Study of changes in the flora, as reflected in the pollens of trees found in the ancient moors, also dis- closed a picture of a sudden climatic catastrophe. \"The deterioration of the climate must have been catastrophic in character,\" wrote Sernander, whose laboratory at the University of Uppsala became the center of research in the history of climate. To the period of the greatest change he gave the name Fimbul-Winter, borrowing the term from the northern epic, the Edda. In this epic Fimbul-Winter is a designation for a snowfall that con- tinued through winter and summer alike, uninterrupted for years. 2 Ibid. 8 Ibid. 4 R.

According to Sernander, \"The desolating effect of the Fimbul- Winter on the northern culture was caused not so much by the fall in temperature as by oscillations and instability of the climate. . . .\" 6 However, its catastrophic beginning was emphasized by him and also by other authors; thus G. Kossinna, who ascribes the Klimasturz to \"about the year 700 B.C.,\" stressed that it took place with catastrophic sud- denness. 6 Tree Rings The annual rings of trees reveal whether in some par- ticular year or period growth was stimulated or inhibited. The oldest trees on record are among the sequoias of California. Some of them measure ninety feet in circum- ference. Of all the specimens whose rings were counted, the most ancient started life after the year 1300 before the present era. (The age of the General Sherman tree in Sequoia National Park is not known, since it has not been cut down.) Thus it appears that no tree has survived to modern times from the days of the great catastrophe of the middle of the second millennium. The sequoias are protected against fire by a bark often two feet thick, which resists combustion almost as well as asbestos. In order to survive through the days of global catastrophe a tree had also to withstand hurricane and tidal wave, and live in a sunless world under a canopy of dust clouds that enshrouded the world for many years. The oldest trees that started life about 3200 years ago offer insight into the influence on their growth, as caused by a series of later climatic disturbances on the global scale that, according to the pollen analysis, took place in the eighth and the beginning of the seventh centuries, or 2700 years ago. According to the historical material col- lected in Worlds in Collision, the memorable dates are 747, -702, and especially 687. 5 Ibid. 6 G.

Douglass, then director of Steward Observatory, who studied tree rings in order to discover the solar activity of the past. 1 The graph actually reveals a spurt of oscillations in the annual growth of the tree rings around the year 747 (the identification of the rings as to their years is approximate). There is an unusually high crest in the last years of the eighth century and the beginning of the seventh century. After a record high crest of six-year duration there is in 687 a precipitate drop. ^ Natural upheavals of great violence reacted destructively upon the forests. But those trees that survived the Kli- masturze of the eighth and seventh centuries (hurricanes, floods, lava, and fire) were stimulated to growth by the increased presence of carbon dioxide in the air, yet im- peded by a screen of clouds and dust; they might have been invigorated by electrical discharges in the atmo- sphere and possibly magnetic storms, and benefited from the addition of ashes to the soil. The singeing of leaves and changed conditions of ground water, as well as the change of climate generally, must have entered the picture. All in all, strong oscillations in the size of tree rings must be expected in years of great natural catastrophes. These are clearly recognizable on the annual rings of sequoias formed about the years 747, 702, 687, and gen- erally in that century. Lake Dwellings At the close of the Stone Age in Europe, about 1800, lake dwellings existed in which man and his cattle lived, protected from wild animals. The structures were erected on wooden poles driven into the ground. Remains of such dwellings were discovered on the shores of the lakes of Scandinavia, Germany, Switzerland, and northern Italy.

Life came to an end in all lake dwellings. Then for about three or four centuries they were not rebuilt; but after 1200 new villages were erected, in some places on top of the earlier ones, in other places on new ground. It was already the Bronze Age in Europe; bronze articles are found among the re- mains of the lake dwellings of that period. After a second period of prosperity, which lasted for about four centuries, in the eighth century before the present era a new catastrophe overwhelmed the lake vil- lages on all the lakes of central and northern Europe, and again it was a \"high-water catastrophe\"; once more mud and sand covered the villages on poles, and, abandoned by man, they were never rebuilt. Thus it occurred that twice, once at the close of the Stone (Neolithic) Age and the second time at the close of the Bronze Age, the lake dwellings were swamped by water and mired in mud. The coincidence of their de- struction with the end of the cultural ages was called merkwiirdig (remarkable) by Ischer, who explored the Bielersee (Lake of Bienne), 1 and rdtselhaft (puzzling) by Reinerth, who explored the Bodensee (Lake Constance); 2 but all explorers agree that the cause was a natural catas- trophe at the end of the Stone Age and another natural catastrophe before the advent of the Iron Age in central and northern Europe. It is also generally held that the catastrophes were accompanied by very great and sudden climatic changes, Klimastiirze. 3 For the first event scientists fix the date at about 1500, some diverging by a few centuries either way, from 1800 to 1400. 4 For the second event the preferred date is the eighth century before the present era, 5 with some authors reducing the date to the seventh century.

The lakes sud- denly lost their horizontal position, one end often being tilted up, the other down, so that the old strand line may now be seen to run obliquely to the horizon. Such is the case of Ammersee and Wtirmsec in the foothills of the Bavarian Alps and of other lakes on the alpine fringes. 7 In these catastrophes, the water of the Bodensee (Lake Constance) rose thirty feet, and the bed was tilted. The tilted strand lines of lakes were also found in regions far away from the Alps, for instance, in Norway by Bravais and Hansen and in Sweden by De Geer and Sandegren, dating from the same ages. 8 Some lake basins were suddenly emptied of all then- water as the result of the tilting, as were Ess-see and Federsee. 9 The Isartal (the valley of the Isar) in the Bavarian Alps was \"violently torn out\" in \"very recent times.\" 10 And in the Inntal in the Tyrol the \"many changes of river beds are indicative of ground move- ments on a great scale.\" n All the explored lakes of the Swiss Alps region, as well as of the Tyrol, the Bavarian Alps, and around the Jura, were flooded twice in catastrophic surges of water (Hoch- wasserkatastrophen) , and the cause lay in tectonic move- ments and in the sudden melting of glaciers.

They undertook a close examination of the pollen content of peat bogs. Since the pollen of each species of tree is characteristic, it is possible to detect by analysis what kinds of forests grew in various periods of the past, and consequently the then prevailing climate. The pollen disclosed a \"radical change of life conditions, not a slow building of fens.\" 13 Men and animals suddenly disappeared from the scene, although at that time the area was already rather thickly populated. Oak was re- placed by fir, and fir descended from the heights on which it had grown, leaving them barren. The Alpine passes were much traveled during the Bronze Age: many bronze objects from before 700 were found in numerous places, especially on St. Bernard. Also mines were worked in the Alps in the Bronze Age. With the advent of the Klimasturz the mines were sud- denly abandoned, and the passes were not traveled any longer, as though life in the Alps had been extinguished. 14 A chronological scale has been set up relating pollen analysis to archaeological finds. The pollen analysis, like other methods of investigation, showed that in the middle of the second millennium and again in the eighth or seventh century before the present era central Europe and Scandinavia passed through climatic catastrophes.

Dropped Ocean Level In many places of the world the seacoast shows either submerged or raised beaches. The previous surf line is seen on the rock of raised beaches; where the coast be- came submerged, the earlier water line is found chiseled by the surf in the rock below the present level of the sea. Some beaches were raised to a height of many hun- dred feet, as in the case of the Pacific coast of Chile, where Charles Darwin observed that the beach must have risen 1300 feet only recently \"within the period during which upraised shells have remained undecayed on the surface.\" He thought also that the \"most probable\" ex- planation would be that the coast level, with \"whole and perfectly preserved shells,\" was \"at one blow uplifted above the future reach of the sea,\" following an earth- quake. 1 In the Hawaiian Islands there is a 1200-foot raised beach. On Espiritu Santo Island in the New Hebrides in the southern Pacific, corals are found 1200 feet above sea level.- Corals do not grow high above the sea or in the depths of the sea; their formation is limited to levels close to the surface of the sea. Thus corals of bygone ages are recorders of previous sea levels. In numerous instances evidences of submergence and emergence are seen on the same rock. One such case we have discussed the Rock of Gibraltar. To lesser degree the phenomenon is repeated in Bermuda. From the evi- dence of submerged caves, the sea level at Bermuda \"must at one time have stood at least 60 to 100 feet lower than at present,\" while from raised beaches \"it appears to have stood at one time at least 25 feet higher than at present\" (H. B. Moore). These changes date from different ages, but com- mon to all of them is the absence of intermediate surf lines; if the emergence or submergence had been gradual, intermediate surf lines would be seen in the rock. 1 Darwin.

Daly observed that in a great many places all around the world there is a uniform emergence of the shore line of eighteen to twenty feet. In the southwest Pacific, on the islands of Tutuila, Tau, and Ofu and on Rose atoll, all belonging to the Samoan group but spread over two hundred miles, the same emergence is evident. In Daly's opinion this uniformity indicates that the rise was due to \"something else than crustal warping.\" A force pushing from inside would not be \"so uniform throughout a stretch 200 miles long.\" 3 Nearly halfway round the world, at St. Helena in the South Atlantic, the lava is punctuated by dry sea caves, the floors of which are covered with water-worn pebbles, \"now dusty because untouched by the surf.\" The emergence here is also twenty feet. At the Cape of Good Hope caves and benches \"also prove recent and sensibly uniform emergence to the extent of about 20 feet.\" Daly proceeds: \"Marine terraces, indicating similar emergence, are found along the Atlantic coast from New York to the Gulf of Mexico; for at least 1000 miles along the coast of eastern Australia; along the coasts of Brazil, southwest Africa, and many islands of the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans; in all these and other published cases, the emergence is recent as well as of the same order of magnitude. Judging from the condition of benches, ter- races, and caves, the emergence seems to have been simultaneous on every shore.\" 4 Of course Daly also found many places where the change in the position of the shore line was of a different magnitude, but \"these local exceptions prove the rule.\" In his opinion, the cause of the world-wide emergence of the shore lies in the sinking of the level of all seas on the globe, \"a recent world-wide sinking of ocean level,\" which could have been caused by water being drawn from the oceans to build the icecaps of Antarctica and Greenland. Alterna- tively, Daly thinks it could also have resulted from a deep- ening of the oceans or from an increase in their areas. P. H. Kuenen of Leyden University, in his Marine Geology, finds Daly's claim confirmed: \"In thirty-odd years following Daly's first paper many further instances 3 Daly, Our Mobile Earth, p. 177. 4 Ibid., p. 178."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"166 KLIMASTURZ have been recorded by a number of investigators the world over, so that this recent shift is now well established.\" 5 Whatever was the cause of the phenomenon observed, it was not the result of a slow change; in such case we would have intermediate shore lines between the present surf line and the twenty-foot line on the same beaches, but there are none. Of special interest is the time of the change. According to Daly, \"This increase of the ice-cap or caps has been tentatively referred to late-Neolithic time, about 3500 years ago. At that approximate date there was some chilling of the northern hemisphere at least, following a prolonged period when the world climate was distinctly warmer than now. Late-Neolithic man lived in Europe 3500 years back.\" 6 As to the date of the sudden drop of oceanic level, Kuenen writes: \"The time of the movement was estimated by Daly to be probably some 3000 to 4000 years ago. Detailed field work in the Netherlands and in eastern England has shown a recent eustatic depression of the same order of magnitude as deduced by Daly.

The geologists assume that the area was once before occupied by a sea, but that early in the Ice Age the detritus carried from Scotland and Scandi- navia filled it, so that there was no sea left: it was all turned into land. The river Rhine flowed through this land and the Thames was its tributary; the mouth of the river was somewhere near Aberdeen. In post-glacial times, so it is assumed, in the Subboreal period, which began about 2000 years before the present era and endured to about 800, large parts of the area were added to the sea. The Atlantic Ocean sent its waters along the Scottish and Norwegian shores, and also through the Channel that had been formed only a short while before. Human artifacts and bones of land animals were dredged from the bottom of the North Sea; and along the shores of Scotland and England, as well as on the Dogger Bank in the middle of the sea, stumps of trees with their roots still in the ground were found. Forty-five miles from the coast, from a depth of thirty-six meters, Norfolk fishermen drew up a spearhead carved from the antler of a deer, embedded in a block of peat. 1 This artifact dates from the Mesolithic or early Neolithic Age and serves as one of many proofs that the area covered by the North Sea was a place of human habitation not many thousands of years ago. From the analysis of the pollens found in the peat taken from the bottom of the sea, the conclusion was reached that these forests existed in not too remote times. It has also been assumed that the building of large areas of the North Sea in the Subboreal period resulted from a rather sudden sinking of the land, which some authorities date at about 1500, or a little earlier, at the same time that floods destroyed the lake dwellings of central Europe. If we consider that Phoenician vessels were already visiting the Atlantic coast of Europe in the days of the Middle Kingdom in Egypt, or before 1500, we begin to see in its historical perspective the catastrophe that spread the North Sea over inhabited land.

The Dogger Bank may have stood out for .some time longer, but at last it, too, was taken over by the sea. After a hundred generations, man began with great effort to recapture bits of land from the sea, building dams and sluices; at this work he, too, discovered bones of animals in vast and tangled masses, of extinct and living forms, generally ascribed to the Ice Age. So, in the Dutch village of Tegelen, in a layer of sand, silt, clay, and peat, ancient elm, ash, and grape were found with extinct fresh-water snails, with bones of elephants, mam- moths, rhinoceroses, hippopotami, deer, horses (Equus stenonis), and hyenas. 8 A recent investigation of the English Fens by H. Godwin of Cambridge University, with emphasis on the plant life in the post-glacial period, disclosed a \"general transgression\" of the sea \"in the period between the Neo- lithic and Romano-British times, for which our evidence is best.\" 4 The Fens occupy an area of about two thousand square miles of Lincolnshire, Cambridge, and Norfolk counties, running east of Norfolk and around the Wash, a gulf of the North Sea. \"The transgression was broken by two periods of retrogression, one in the Bronze Age, and the other after [the beginning of] the Iron Age.\" Within the Neolithic period \"the forest trees ... all fell to the northwest. These fallen forests were mostly oak.\" 2 Janssens, however, writes: \"L'ouverture de la mer du Nord sur Vocean Atlantique est done beaucoup plus recente que la coupure de la Mediterranee aux colonnes d'Hercule; elle coincide 6 peu pres avec I'epanouissement de la civilisation sumerienne en Mesopotatnie.\" 3 Flint, Glacial Geology and the Pleistocene Epoch, p. 325. 4 H.

The history of ancient Crete or of the Minoan culture on it is divided into Early, Middle, and Late Minoan ages, corresponding in time with the Old, Middle, and New Kingdoms in Egypt. The period of the Hyksos hi Egypt, between the Middle and the New Kingdoms, coin- cides with the last the third subdivision of Middle Minoan.

North of Crete is the volcanic island of Thera, or San- torin. The volcano is not yet extinguished. Its crater was blown off in a formidable explosion in the past and a large caldera was formed. A German-Greek expedition explored the island and published a detailed account of the vehement explosion of the former age. At that time villages were buried by lava, pumice, and ashes; the ex- cavated cultural remains showed that the great explosion took place \"between 1800 and 1500 B.C.,\" or at the end of the Middle Kingdom in Egypt. 13 The erupted masses were so vast that a German scholar offered in recent years a theory according to which the Egyptian plague of dark- ness was caused by the eruption of the Thera volcano, six hundred miles northwest of the Delta. In Egypt the rock structure of the land experienced at least localized displacements at the end of the Middle Kingdom. K. R. Lepsius observed that the Milometers at Semneh, dating trom the Middle Kingdom, show an average rise in the waters of the Nile at that place, where the river is channeled in rock, twenty-two feet higher than the highest level of today. 14 \"We obtained the remark- able result that about 4000 years ago the Nile used to rise at that point, on an average, twenty-two feet higher than it does at present.\" This dropping of the high-water level must be ascribed either to a change in the quantity of water in the Nile or to a change in the rock structure of Egypt. However, if the Nile contained so much more water in the past, many residences and temples would have been regularly inundated.

In 1873, Heinrich Schliemann, though not an archaeologist, dis- covered there the remains of the fortress sung in the Iliad. From his early years as grocer's apprentice, cabin boy on a ship that was wrecked, and bookkeeper in Hol- land, he had nourished the ambition to find Troy. After many wanderings that took him to Russia and California and the Far East, he settled in Greece, published his predic- tion of where he would find the city of the Iliad, and was met with jeers. But he soon succeeded in locating the legendary city in the Turkish village of Hissarlik. 1 It had been built six or seven times and as many times destroyed. Schliemann took the rich city on the second lowest level to be the Troy of King Priam, which endured the siege and then succumbed to the Greeks, or Achaeans, warriors under Agamemnon. Later scholars have identified the second city as of a much earlier date, and declared the sixth city from the bottom to be that of Priam and Homer. The second city came to an end at the time the Old Kingdom of Egypt fell; it was destroyed in a violent paroxysm of nature. The archaeological expedition of Cincinnati University under Carl Blegen has established that an earthquake de- stroyed the city besieged by Agamemnon. 2 Claude Schaef- fer, the excavator of Ras Shamra (Ugarit) in Syria, came to Troy to compare the finds of Blegen with his own at Ras Shamra and became convinced that the earthquakes and conflagrations he had noted at Ras Shamra were synchronical with the earthquakes and conflagrations of Troy, six hundred miles away. He then compared the findings of these two places with signs of earthquakes in numerous other localities of the ancient East. After pain- staking work he came to the conclusion that more than once in historical tunes the entire region had been shaken by prodigious earthquakes, an area unusually large when 1 At the end of the eighteenth century, in a time before the modern era of archaeology, Le Chevalier made a guess that Hissarlik was the site of Homeric Troy, or Ilion.

The city subsequently constructed, Troy III, was also destroyed in a great and sudden catastrophe; it was \"a most terrible fire.\" Dorpfeld, the renowned archaeologist who worked with Schliemann and survived him by many years, wondered at the violence of the earthquake that overturned a sixteen meters (over fifty feet) thick fortress wall of Troy III. 4 SchaefTer found that the same destruc- tion also spread all over Asia Minor and far beyond. Efforts to build a new city, Troy IV, on the ashes of the old were cut short by a new and unexpected conflagra- tion. Once again the ground was covered \"with a thick bed of ashes and carbonized substance indicating clearly that the buildings fell during a fire.\" 5 Troy VI, which followed the fifth city and is usually recognized as the capital of King Priam, was destroyed by an earthquake. A natural force more powerful than the army of Agamemnon brought about its end. It was a violent shaking of the ground, as is also narrated in the Iliad.

All of these catastrophes of earthquake and fire were of such encompassing extent that Asia Minor, Mesopotamia, the Caucasus, the Iranian plateau, Syria, Palestine, Cyprus, and Egypt were simultaneously overwhelmed. And some of these catastrophes were, in addition, of such violence that they closed great ages in the history of ancient civilizations. The enumerated countries were the subject of Schaef- fer's detailed inquiry; and recognizing the magnitude of the catastrophes that have no parallels in modern annals or in the concepts of seismology, he became convinced that these countries, the ancient sites of which he studied, represent only a fraction of the area that was gripped by the shocks.

In Egypt it was the time of the Middle Kingdom, a short but glorious resurrection of Egyptian civilization and might. Literature reached its perfection, political might its apogee. Then came a shock that hi a single day made of this empire a ruin, of its art debris, of its population corpses. Again it was the entire ancient East, to its uttermost frontiers, that fell prostrate; nature, which knows no boundaries, threw all countries into a tremor and cov- ered the land with ashes. \"This brilliant period of the Middle Bronze Age, during which flourished the art of the Middle Kingdom in Egypt and the exquisite art and industry of the Middle Minoan Age [on Crete], and in the course of which great centers -of trade like Ugarit in Syria enjoyed remarkable pros- perity, was suddenly terminated. . . . \"The great activity of international trade, which, during the Middle Bronze Age, had been characteristic of the eastern Mediterranean and most of the lands of the Fertile Crescent, suddenly stopped in all this vast area. ...

Also in Ras Shamra there is a marked gap between the horizons of the Middle and the Late Bronze. In Palestine, at Beth Mirsim, there was an interruption in the habitation of the site after the fall of the Middle Kingdom in Egypt. In Beth-Shan, between the layers of the Middle Bronze and Late Bronze, the excavators came upon an accumulation of debris a meter thick. \"It indi- cates that the transition from the Middle Bronze to the Late Bronze was accompanied by an upheaval that broke the chronological and stratigraphical sequence of the site.\" A similar situation was found at Tell el Hesy by Bliss. Earth tremors played havoc also with Jericho, Megiddo, Beth-Shemesh, Lachish, Ascalon, Tell Taanak. The excavators of Jericho found that the city had been repeatedly destroyed. The great wall surrounding it fell in an earthquake shortly after the end of the Middle Kingdom. 2 Concussions devastated the entire land of the Double Stream. The Russian-Persian borderland also shows that there was no continuity between the Middle Bronze and Late Bronze. In the Caucasus not an archaeological ves- tige was found of the centuries between these two ages. A sea tide broke onto the land, as on the coast of Ras Shamra, bringing further destruction in its wake.

In other countries, too, not conquerors or migrating hordes but earthquakes and fire were the agents of destruction. \"Our inquiry has demonstrated that these repeated crises which opened and closed the principal periods of the third and second mil- lennia were caused not by the action of man. Far from it, because compared with the vastness of these all- embracing crises and their profound effects, the exploits of conquerors . . . would appear only insignificant.\" 6 Schaeffer finds indications that the climate changed abruptly in the wake of the catastrophes; the phenomenon was ubiquitous: \"At the same time in the Caucasus and in certain areas of prehistoric Europe, changes of climate have caused, as it appears, transformations in the occupa- tion and economy of the countries.\" 7 The catastrophe that served as the starting point for two of my works, Worlds in Collision and Ages in Chaos, left archaeological imprints on biblical and Homeric lands, from the Dardanelles to the Caucasian barrier, the Per- sian highland, and the cataracts of the Nile.

But we have much more evidence, and no wonder: the catastrophes being ubiquitous, their effects must be found everywhere. The Rhone Glacier in the Alps started to melt 2400 years ago, in the middle of the first millennium. This cal- culation of De Lapparent coincides with that at which we arrived by dating the last catastrophe in 687. In this catastrophe many older glaciers melted, and the subse- quent increased evaporation and precipitation built other glaciers that before long also started to melt, a process that has been going on ever since. Many glaciers of the Alps, it was recently learned with surprise, are less than 4000 years old (Flint). Catastrophic changes in climate, found by Sernander and others in Scandinavia, correspond almost exactly with our dates: in the second millennium, about 1500, and once more, 800 to 700 years before the present era, or thirty-four and almost twenty-seven centuries ago* The same dates are established through pollen analysis by Gams and Nordhagen for the catastrophic changes of climate in German fens and tectonic disturbances in cen- tral Europe; and again the same dates, close to the mid- dle of the second millennium before the present era and once more following the year 800, are fixed by Paret and other authors for the climatic catastrophes that are reflected in the history of the lake dwellings in Germany, Switzerland, and northern Italy. Careful investigation by W. A. Johnston of the Niagara River bed disclosed that the present channel was cut by the falls less than 4000 years ago. And equally careful investigation of the Bear River delta by Hanson, who compared measurements repeated in periodic surveys, showed that the age of this delta is 3600 years, its origin going back to the middle of the second millennium be- fore the present era. Warren Upham's research on the great glacial Lake Agassiz and the striations of the exposed rocks there in- dicates that the lake was formed but a few thousand years ago and existed for a short time only. The study by Claude Jones of the lakes of the Great Basin showed that these lakes, remnants of larger glacial lakes, have existed only about 3500 years, and also that the Ice Age fauna survived to a date equally recent.

The study of the magnetic properties of the clay of Etruscan vases points to a reversal of the general mag- netic field of the earth, and also to a passage of the earth through strong magnetic fields in historical times. The Florida fossil beds at Vero and Melbourne proved by the artifacts found there together with human bones and the remains of animals, many of which are extinct that these fossil beds were deposited between 2000 and 4000 years ago. As brought out by Godwin, the two irrup- tions of the sea on English shores also took place some- time in the second and first millennia before the present era. According to an earlier work, by Prestwich, the ir- ruption of the sea was of a very violent nature; it spread to central France and the French Riviera, to Gibraltar, Corsica, and Sicily, and to the entire area that stretches to the lands of the ancient East. In all these places animal bones have been found broken but fresh; these bones of extant and extinct species have been found in fissures and caverns, sometimes on the tops of high hills, in great num- bers. The bones found in English caves, covered with diluvium, were also described as fresh and unfossilized. From observations on beaches in numerous places all over the world, Daly concluded that there was a change in the ocean level, which dropped sixteen to twenty feet 3500 years ago; Kuenen and others confirmed Daly's find- ings with evidence derived from Europe.

But the idea of the slow and grad- ual extinction of Ice Age fauna is opposed by students of the problem, who feel that \"sudden and decisive geo- l A. L. Kroeber In the volume dedicated to A. M.

K. S.

As an additional argument the archaeologist points to pictures of extinct animals in Babylonian and Egyptian bas-reliefs, the bones of which have actually been found. And the anthropologist believes that even oral traditions concerning extinct animals are grounds for far-reaching conclusions. \"Archaeology has proved that the American Indian hunted and killed elephants; it has also strongly indicated that these elephants have been extinct for several thou- sand years. This means that the traditions of the Indians recalling these animals have retained their historical valid- ity for great stretches of time.

But die it did.\" 7 Yet even the reduction of the time when the major part of the Pleistocene fauna succumbed on the western coast from one million years to only thirty or twenty or even ten thousand years is insufficient if Jones's estimate of the age of Lahontan deposits is correct. According to his analysis of the salt accumulation in the residual lakes 01 the larger Lake Lahontan, this glacial lake came into ex- istence only 3500 years ago, and the fauna found in it deposit could not be older.

Thus we witness a return to the view held by American geologists in the latter part of the nineteenth and the be- ginning of the present century: George Frederick Wright (1838-1921), Newton Horace Winchell (1839-1914), Warren Upham (1850-1934). Wright concluded that the Ice Age \"did not close until about the time that the civilization of Egypt, Babylonia and Western Turkestan had attained a high degree of development,\" and this in opposition to the \"greatly exaggerated ideas of the antiq- uity of the glacial epoch.\" 9 Toward this view, with slow steps, scientific opinion is approaching, though it still maintains that there was a great gap between the Ice Age and the beginning of recorded history, the survival of many Ice Age animals until the second millennium before the present era not- withstanding. Collapsing Schemes In 1829 Gerard Deshayes published his studies on the fossiliferous strata in the Paris area, where marine animals alternate with land animals; these strata disclosed that in the upper marine bed were many kinds of shell-bearing mollusks that still inhabit the waters of the sea, and that the deeper the stratum, the fewer the living forms of mollusks. Following the publication of Deshayes's work, Lyell devised a timetable of geological ages. The fossilized re- mains of ancient animals indicate changes in fauna in the course of time; Lyell's measurement of geological periods is based on such changes in the animal kingdom, espe- cially among the shell fauna. He found that there has been in the Quaternary, or the age of man, not more than one twentieth of the evolution that has occurred since the lower Miocene (middle series of Tertiary, the age of mammals). From that point on he traced one complete \"cycle of evolution,\" during which, at his esti- mate, practically all species that existed at the opening of the cycle were replaced by new species.

By this method Lyell reckoned twelve cycles, or 240,000,000 years, from the beginning of the Paleozoic, or the time of early life forms on the earth. This figure is now con- siderably increased; the other figures are accepted at LyelTs valuation. Lyell's scheme, perfected by the introduction of new subdivisions of geological epochs, sets forth the following rule. If a stratum contains ninety to a hundred per cent modern species of shells, the stratum is Pleistocene, or of the Ice Age; if it contains forty to ninety per cent modern species of shells, the stratum belongs to the last sub- division of Tertiary the Pliocene; if only twenty to forty per cent of the shells in a stratum are present-day varie- ties, then the stratum is of Miocene time, an earlier sub- division of the Tertiary; and so on, down to the stratum where shells of extant species of mollusks find no direct ancestors. Lyell's time system is based on the assumption that no catastrophic events intervened and that the extirpation of species was the result of slow extinction, which Darwin's theory ascribes to the survival of the fittest in the struggle for the limited means of existence. But if great catastro- phes occurred on the surface of the earth and in the depths of the seas, of more than local character, and if in such upheavals some forms of life perished and others survived, and the progeny of still others underwent strong mutations, then the entire scheme of percentages and time allotment by the multiplication of changes ob- served in the last epoch, with its preconceived plan and rigidity, is no more valid than the pronouncements of some theologians, like Archbishop Ussher of Ireland, who in 1654 declared that the Creation took place at nine o'clock in the morning on the twenty-sixth day of Octo- ber in the year 4004 B.C.

Whatever the age of the universe and the earth, single geological epochs were of very different length than has been assumed on the ground of the theory of uniformity. The very concept of a 60,000,000-year-long Tertiary when mountains were uplifted, followed by 1,000,000 years of Ice Age, a time of great climatic changes, followed by 30,000 years of the tranquillity of Recent time, with quietude in mountain building and stability in climate, is basically wrong. The mountain building went on during the Ice Age, coinciding with climatic catastrophes, and both endured into Recent time, only a few thousand years ago. In Early Ages When the earlier rocks are investigated they are found to be records of great upheavals in comparison with which the upheavals of later times appear only minor. Along the Canadian border west of Lake Superior in the Keewatin area, a complex of ancient lava flows and inter- bedded sedimentary rock reached, according to C. O.

Then in Cambrian time seas flooded the continents, and dolomite and metamorphosed rocks 3000 to 4000 feet thick were formed. Only lower animal life was present in the world. Yet \"the simplest, unspecialized ancestors of modern animals, are most intensely modern themselves in the zoological sense and . . . belong to the same order of nature as that which prevails at the present day.\" In Or- dovician time the sea submerged \"fully half of the present [American] continent and reduced it to a group of great islands.\" In the beginning of that period, \"the marine waters also spilled over and at times spread widely across the central and eastern part of the United States.\" Later in that period \"a vast sea spread southward from the Arctic across central Canada to join the southern em- bayments that occupied much of the United States.*' Mountains were rising, folding, and overthrusting, in the so-called Taconian disturbance. This was accompanied by volcanic activity.

At the same time coral reefs were built hi arctic Canada, from Alaska to Manitoba, as well as in Newfoundland and northern Greenland.

The close of this period was marked by the so- called Caledonian disturbance in Europe, with a mountain crest rising across the British Isles and Scandinavia. \"Throughout the length of Norway and Sweden, a dis- tance exceeding 1 1 00 miles, the pre-Devonian formations were folded, overturned, and overthrust with eastward movement on individual fault planes as great as 20 to 40 miles.\" Again coral grew in arctic regions.

In eastern Australia mountains were formed that stretched the full length of the eastern border of the continent. \"Much igneous activity had occurred during the period in this region, and the Devonian strata and associated volcanics are said to be over 30,000 feet thick.\" Throughout Devonian time North America must have been connected with Europe by a land bridge \"which later subsided beneath the north Atlantic.\" Evidence that these two lands met is found in the land plants and fresh- water animals preserved in the Devonian rocks of the two regions, \"which are so much alike on both sides of the Atlantic that it seems clear they were free to migrate across an easy land bridge.\" In the Carboniferous period mountains were made, seas invaded land, corals built reefs on the arctic coast of Alaska and on the polar islands of Spitsbergen, volcanoes erupted, and glaciation took place, especially in Australia.

Here I stop quoting from Historical Geology. Again and again the world was a playground for Vulcan and Poseidon, the elementary forces of melting rock and tres- passing sea. But when all is told, we are nevertheless assured that the geological record is one of calm and uniformity, and what appears as revolution is a telescoped view of slow and ordinary processes; even the seas of lava, though obviously formed in single paroxysms, are, in the over-all picture, denied a catastrophic origin. One reads, \"It is not obvious that the city of Boston rests on the surface of one of the world's greatest moun- tain chains yet it does\" (it had been depressed and also eroded) (Daly 2 ); one reads also that \"Boston lay in the equatorial rain zone during the Carboniferous and in the region of hot deserts during the Permian\" (Brooks 8 ); one is, furthermore, told that the site of Boston was once under the sea, and that it was once also under a mile- thick cap of ice. It is insisted that all these changes took place without any upheavals in nature, merely as effects of processes and agents active also in our own time the highest mountains becoming flat, equatorial jungles giving place to hot sand deserts and hot deserts to a polar cover of ice, and the polar cover of ice to the bottom of the sea and the bottom of the sea to the site of Harvard University. It all happened so slowly that no living creature ever perceived the change. Coal Coal is found in layers that are ascribed to various ages mainly on the basis of fossils found in them. Brown coal is a compacted mass of plant remains. Lignite is made chiefly out of trees only partially converted into coal. Soft or bituminous coal is brittle and of bright luster and contains sulfur; its organic nature can sometimes be seen under a lens, and the plants that participated in its forma- tion can be recognized by leaves in the shales on top of the coal bed. Anthracite or hard coal is metamorphosed bituminous coal. 2 Daly, Our Mobile Earth, p. 239. 8 Brooks, Climate through the Ages, p. 232."},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"196 COLLAPSING SCHEMES The plants that went into the formation of ancient beds include chiefly ferns and cycads; layers of later ages are composed of sassafras, laurel, tulip tree, magnolia, cinnamon, sequoia, poplar, willow, maple, birch, chest- nut, alder, beech, elm, palm, fig tree, cypress, oak, rose, plum, almond, myrtle, acacia, and many other species. 1 The origin of the coal beds is still far from being satis- factorily explained. 2 One theory would make peat bogs the place where, in a slow process measured by tens and hundreds of thousands of years, coal was born. It is said that the plants fall, but before they decompose in the air they are covered by the water of the swamps. A layer of sand is deposited over them, forming the soil for new plants, and thus the process repeats itself. In order that the layer of sand may be deposited, it is necessary that these marshy regions be covered by water in motion. Since almost regularly marine shells and fossils are found on top of coal beds, the sea must have covered the swamps at one time; then, for new land plants to grow there, the sea must have retreated. There are places where sixty, eighty, and a hundred and more successive beds of coal have formed; this theory would then require that as many times the sea trespassed when the land slowly subsided and as many times retreated. In other words, this theory assumes that the ground is pulsating and that the sea will return again sometime and cover the coal beds as it did a hundred times in the past. \"Fossils oi marine clams, snails . . . are abundant in the shales just above each seam of coal. Later, with fluctuat- ing sea level, the salt waters withdrew and another fresh- water marsh came into being, giving rise to another bed of coal above the earlier one. Again we are surprised, this time by the large number of such alternations of coal with marine sediments; these are now recognized as dis- tinct cycles, each cycle representing a common sequence of events. . . . Ohio displays more than forty such cycles, and in Wales more than a hundred separate seams of coal have been discovered. Marvin Miller has given 400,000 years as the probable time represented by the average Ohio cycle.\" 3 1 Price, The New Geologv, pp. 468-69. 2 Sec Sucss, The race of the harth, II. 244. 8 Chmnberlin, in The World and Man, ed.

This fact suffices to render the peat-bog theory untenable. Seams of coal are sometimes fifty or more feet thick. No forest could make such a layer of coal; it is estimated that it would take a twelve-foot layer of peat deposit to make a layer of coal one foot thick; and twelve feet of peat deposit would require plant remains a hundred and twenty feet high. How tall and thick must a forest be, then, in order to create a seam of coal not one foot thick but fifty? The plant remains must be six thousand feet thick. In some places there must have been fifty to a hundred successive huge forests, one replacing the other, since so many seams of coal are formed. But it is further questionable whether the forests grew one on top of the other, because a coal bed, undivided on one side, some- times splits on the other side into numerous beds, with layers of limestone or other formations between. The consideration of the enormous mass of organic matter needed to form a coal seam brought about the birth of another theory of the origin of coal. Fallen trees were carried along by overflowing rivers, and coal was formed from them, not from the plants in situ. This the- ory explains the enormous accumulation of dying plants in some localities; it may be able to show why, in many cases, a fossilized tree trunk is embedded in coal with its lower part uppermost, or standing on its head which the peat-bog theory does not explain. But the drift theory cannot account for the fact that various kinds of marine 4 Ibid., p. 78."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"198 COLLAPSING SCHEMES life are mixed with the coal. Carbonaceous and bitumi- nous shales are frequently packed with fossilized marine fish. Deep-sea crinoids and clear-water ocean corals often alternate with the coal beds. Erratic boulders, too, are often encased in coal. It was supposed that these boulders were carried by chance on natural rafts of closely drifting logs and thus became em- bedded in the coal. Close rafts of drifting trunks are con- ceivable only after a great hurricane. However, marine fish would not enter deeply into inundating rivers to be entombed together with the boulders, and coral does not grow in muddy water. Apparently the coal was not formed in the ways de- scribed. Forests burned, a hurricane uprooted them, and a tidal wave or succession of tidal waves coming from the sea fell upon the charred and splintered trees and swept them into great heaps, tossed by billows, and cov- ered them with marine sand, pebbles and shells, and weeds and fishes; another tide deposited on top of the sand more carbonized logs, threw them in other heaps, and again covered them with marine sediment. The heated ground metamorphosed the charred wood into coal, and if the wood or the ground where it was buried was drenched in a bituminous outpouring, bituminous coal was formed. Wet leaves sometimes survived the forest fires and, swept into the same heaps of logs and sand, left their design on the coal. Thus it is that seams of coal are covered with marine sediment; for that reason also a seam may bifurcate and have marine deposits be- tween its branches. A support of this my view on the origin of coal I find in a recently published extensive work by Heriberi Nils- son, professor emeritus of botany at Lund University. 5 Nilsson presents the results of an inquiry into the botan- ical and zoological composition of the brown coal (lig- nite) of Geiseltal in Germany, made by Johannes Weigelt of Halle and his group. 6 Many plants found in Geiseltal lignite are tropical, of species that do not grow even in the subtropics.

Hoffmann; W. Beyn). Algae and fungi on the leaves pre- served in the coal are found presently on plants in Java, Brazil, and Cameroons (Kock). Besides the dominating tropical flora in Geiseltal, plants are represented there from almost every part of the globe. The associated insect fauna of Geiseltal coal is found \"in present Africa, in East Asia, and in America in various regions, preserved in almost original purity\" (Walther and Weigelt). The coal of Geiseltal is rated as belonging to the beginning of the Tertiary time. As to the reptilian, avian, and mammalian fauna, the coal is a \"veritable graveyard.\" Apes, crocodiles, and marsupials (pouch animals) left their remains in this coal. An Indo-Australian bird, an American condor, trop- ical giant snakes, East Asian salamanders, left their re- mains there too (O. Kuhn). Some of the animals are of the steppe habitat, and others, like crocodiles, came from swamps. Not only do the origin and the habitats of plants and animals offer a very paradoxical picture, but so also does their state of preservation. Chlorophyll is preserved in the leaves found in the brown coal (Weigelt and Noack). The leaves must have been rather quickly excluded from contact with air and light, or rapidly entombed: these were neither leaves falling off the plants in the fall nor leaves exposed to the action of light and atmosphere after being torn off by a storm. Entire strata of leaves from all parts of the world, counted by the billions, though torn to shreds but with their fine fibers (nervature) intact, in many cases still green, are found in the Geiseltal lignite. It is not different with the animals. If exposed after death for any length of time to natural conditions, the structure of animal tissues loses its fineness; the muscles and the epidermis (skin) of the animals of the brown coal of Geiseltal were found to have retained their fine struc- ture (Voigt). Also the colors of the insects are preserved in their original splendor.

No bones of these dead buffaloes became fossils in sedimen- tary rocks, and scarcely any are found in a state of pres- ervation. The evolutionary theory of the formation of fossils makes certain conditions obligatory: Sedimentary rock is formed in a slow process on the bottom of the sea, and the bones of animals buried in the sediment become fos- silized. Land animals wade in the shallow waters of the sea or lakes, die when wading, and their bodies are covered with sediment. The sediment must quickly cover the animals, and this is most possible when the ground subsides. Therefore Darwin postulated such subsidence of the sea bottom as a condition for the formation of fossils. On the other hand, the subsidence or emergence of the ground in the theory of uniformity or evolution is a very slow process, longer by far than the time necessary for a cadaver to disintegrate in water. The giant reptiles are supposed to have lived as am- 201"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"202 EXTINCTION phibians on land and in the shallow sea because of the numerous fossil remains in sedimentary rock. How- ever, no signs of adaptation for aquatic life are found in their skeletons. Their bodies were so heavy, it is assumed, that they looked for an opportunity to wade or swim though it would seem that if they had difficulty in carry- ing their bodies on land they must have experienced still more difficulty in dragging themselves out of the muddy ground of the shallow water on the beaches. Birds too are supposed to have died while wading and been buried. When a fish dies its body floats on the surface or sinks to the bottom and is devoured rather quickly, actually in a matter of hours, by other fish. However, the fossil fish found in sedimentary rock is very often preserved with all its bones intact. Entire shoals of fish over large areas, numbering billions of specimens, are found in a state of agony, but with no mark of a scavenger's attack. The explanation of the origin of fossils by the theory of uniformity and evolution contradicts the fundamental principle of these theories: Nothing took place in the past that does not take place in the present. Today no fossils are formed. Petrified bones of reptiles, birds, and mammals are often found in large unbroken areas; and since it is quite difficult to describe such areas as wading places, another explanation of the origin of fossils is sometimes offered: the animals were drowned and buried in inundations of large rivers. This explanation seems for certain cases gen- erally closer to the truth than the wading theory; how- ever, the size of the continental areas covered by floods imply catastrophic events on a large scale, and such events, far beyond what is observed on seasonally over- flowing rivers today, again contradict the principle of uniformity. Finally, the very process of sediment formation is not without its problem. Sediment building is supposed to go of permanently in the sea, the building material being the detritus carried by the rivers or broken by the billows from the rocks on the coast and, mainly, the ooze, or calcareous skeletons of myriads of minute living beings, which are abundant in the sea and find their graves on the bottom. The thickness of the sediment on the bottom of the ocean is supposed to give a timetable for the age of the ocean; but, contrary to expectation, in some places"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"FOOTPRINTS 203 on the bottom of the ocean core samples have detected almost no sedimentary rock, indicating that the bottom of the ocean was formed in those places only recently; and in other places, even on land, the sedimentary rock is enormously thick, sometimes tens of thousands of feet. If one and the same process continually and equally de- posits the calcareous ooze and detritus on the sea bottom, the inequalities in sedimentary bedrock are as little ex- plained as the formation of fossils. Both these phenomena are explainable by cataclysmic events in the past. The floor of the ocean was lifted in some places and dropped in others, the sediment was vio- lently shifted, the content of the ocean depths was spilled onto the land, land animals were engulfed and buried by enormous tides carrying debris, in many places ava- lanches of sand and volcanic dust entombed the aquatic life, fish skeletons remaining in poses of death, unde- voured and undecayed. Footprints In numerous places and in various formations are found footprints of animals of prehistoric times. Those of dinosaurs and other animals are clearly impressed in rock. The accepted explanation is that these animals walked on muddy ground, and their imprints were pre- served as the ground became hard and stony. This explanation cannot stand up against critical ex- amination. On muddy ground one may find impressions of the hoofs of cattle or horses. But the very next rain will smudge these impressions, and after a short while they will be there no more. If we do not find the hoofprints of cattle that passed along a path the season before, how is it that the toe imprints of animals of prediluvial times remain intact in the mud on which they walked? The imprints must have been made like impressions in soft sealing wax that hardens before they are blurred or obliterated. The ground must have been soft when the animal ran upon it, and then it quickly hardened before changes could take place. Sometimes we see imprints of animals that chanced to walk over freshly laid concrete. While the substance was soft, a dog or a bird or a"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"204 EXTINCTION large insect might have walked on it and left impressions recognizable when it hardened. Also, heated sand, turn- ing into a viscous substance on its way to becoming hard- ened glass, could receive and preserve imprints. The vestiges could also remain in muddy, unheated ground that was soon covered by lava which filled hi the imprints and later disintegrated on being weathered away. In historical times in the volcanic .destruction of Pompeii and Her- culaneum lava and volcanic ashes filled the wheel tracks in the streets of these cities and thus preserved them to our day. In the eruption of Kilauea hi Hawaii in 1790, when many people lost their lives, and with them a brigade of the Hawaiian army, the footprints of trapped humans and animals were retained in the hardened volcanic ash. 1 Wherever footprints in the ground dating from his- torical or prehistoric tunes are found, we may assume that most probably a catastrophe took place when these vestiges were left or very shortly thereafter. If a catas- trophe was in progress or was threatening, the animals must have been in terror and flight. The footprints actually show that the animals in most cases were fleeing, not wading or loitering about; sometimes the configuration of the impressions indicates that an animal was indecisive, probably trapped by some peril closing hi from all sides. The animals that were hi flight for then* lives may have succumbed a few moments later, crushed or burned in the disaster. The ground was swept by driven sand and ashes or covered by lava or asphalt, or cement, or fluid silicon, then possibly covered by floods, and the imprints in the heated soil that was baked to stone have survived to the present day. So it is that we do not find tracks of animals that peacefully walked one hundred or three hundred years ago, but we do find traces and vestiges of animals that walked and ran many thousands of years ago. The Caverns It has been observed that when in a great panic carniv- orous animals and the animals that usually are their prey 1 W. M. Agar, R. F. Flint, and C. R. Longwell.

So when forests burn, horses and wolves, gazelles and hyenas flee along the same paths, all gripped by the same terror, paying no attention to one another. When prairies burn or jungles are enveloped in flame, wild beasts and tame creatures in mixed herds stampede to save their lives. In earthquake or in flood, animals lose their mutual animosity in a common fear. It has also been observed that in earthquakes and other calamities wild animals will come to the abodes of men. In their great migrations animals behave differently than when they travel singly or in small herds; so lemming, which scurry away from a man at the sound of his foot- steps, will overrun house, town, and river when migrating in large bands, perishing in great numbers but going for- ward in a huge wave. In great natural catastrophes animals seek cover from terrifying phenomena floods, falling meteorites, burning forests, and frightening portents in the sky. Caverns are the places of refuge most sought. An instinct in animals impels them to escape into a den, a hole in the ground, and large animals run for caverns. They may remember such places in the hour of catastrophe, and one may follow another. Of course, many animals never reach the shelter of a cave, but some of them do. And when, in the detritus on the floor of a cave, bones are found of animals that usually would not associate, and the bones are mixed together, and those of the prey animals are not crushed by the teeth of the carnivores, then it is almost certain that these animals tried to save themselves, unafraid of one another, in this cave in the face of approaching catastrophe. It is possible that some of the animals in the shelter survived the catastrophe, and then their wild instincts must have returned; but in many cases all of them suc- cumbed, overwhelmed by gases, smoke, eddying currents on the surface of the earth, and tides that burned them under sediment. In numerous places of the world the bone content of caves indicates that they served as hide-outs in times of supreme danger. Lions and tigers, wolves and hyenas, gazelles and hares shared the refuge and there found their common grave. But not all places where such as-"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"206 EXTINCTION semblages of bones are discovered were sought for refuge. In many cases the animals were swept from large areas by a tidal wave and thrown against rocks, and the water rushing through the fissures left behind the animals with all their bones broken within their torn bodies. From as far as China, to England and France and the islands of the Mediterranean, examples of fissures with bones, splintered and mingled together, have been presented in this book. Not only fissures in the rocks but caverns in the hills may have been filled with bones, though the caverns might not originally have been sought for shelter. An irrupting sea or great lake, lifted from its bed and carrying its own detritus and land debris, swept hetero- geneous herds of animals and carried them to the farthest reaches and threw over them hills of gravel, rock, and earth. Cumberland cave, described on an earlier page, is one of many examples. If the bones are found rolled, they were most prob- ably carried from afar, and were from animals that had died long before; if the bones are more or less intact, the chances are that the place was a shelter that failed; and if the bones are splintered, it is highly probable that the animals were smashed by a great force against rocks or resisting ground. Extinction Many forms of life, many species and genera of ani- mals that lived on this planet in a recent geological period, hi the age of man, have utterly disappeared with- out leaving a single survivor. Mammals walked in fields and forests, propagated and multiplied, and then without a sign of degeneration vanished. \"A considerable group have become extinct virtually within the last few thousand years. . . . The large mam- mals that died out [in America] include all the camels, all the horses, all the ground sloths, two genera of musk- oxen, peccaries, certain antelopes, a giant bison with a horn spread of six feet, a giant beaverlike animal, a stag- moose, and several kinds of cats, some of which were of lion size.\" 1 Also the Imperial elephant and the Colum- 1 Flint, Glacial Geology and the Pleistocene Epoch, p. 523."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"EXTINCTION 207 bian mammoth, animals larger than the African elephant and common all over North America, disappeared. The mastodon that inhabited the forests and ranged from Alaska to the Atlantic coast and Mexico, and the woolly mammoth that roamed in a broad area adjacent to the ice sheets, likewise persisted until a few thousand years ago. 2 The dire wolf, the saber-toothed tiger, the short-faced bear, the small horse (Equus tau) disappeared, and are no longer found either in the Old or in the New World. Many birds, too, became extinct. These species are believed to have been destroyed \"to the last specimen\" in the closing Ice Age. Animals, strong and vigorous, suddenly died out without leaving a sur- vivor. The end came, not in the course of the struggle for existence with the survival of the fittest. Fit and unfit, and mostly fit, old and young, with sharp teeth, with strong muscles, with fleet legs, with plenty of food around, all perished. These facts, as I have already quoted, drive \"the biologist to despair as he surveys the extinction of so many species and genera in the closing Pleistocene [Ice Age]\" 8 In the woolly mammoth the genus of elephants achieved its evolutionary perfection; as was already shown by Falconer and known to Darwin, the teeth of the mam- moth were superior to those of modern elephants; and in many other respects their adaptation was perfect. The theory of evolution had in the mammoth one of the best examples of a species evolving in the struggle for survival by adaptation. Stone Age man made drawings of it; pos- sibly he even domesticated some of them. In the Neolithic (Stone Age) town of Predmost in Moravia bones of eight hundred to one thousand mammoths were found; their shoulder blades were used in building tombs. On the vast plains of northern Siberia they roamed in herds. They succumbed there as if hi one cold night that fell over the land and knew no recess thereafter. They did not die from starvation their food was found in their stomachs and also between their teeth. The best-preserved body of a mammoth with even its eyeballs intact was found in 2 L H.

It appears that it was \"some sudden and unexpected cataclysm,\" 5 for the mam- moths, together with rhinoceroses, bison, and others whose bones and teeth make the main substance of the New Siberian Islands, fill the bottom of the Arctic Ocean above Siberia, and lie in the frozen earth of the Siberian tundras. At about the same time the mammoth also perished in Europe and in America. The mastodon, too, was exterminated at the dawn of the present era. There was no scarcity of their food it consisted of herbs, leaves, and bark, as is known from the undigested food found within their skeletons. They lived in all parts of the Americas. Over two hundred skeletons were unearthed in New York State. It is not known what brought this widespread group to an end. Fossil bones of horses indicate that this was a very common animal in the New World in the Ice Age. But when the soldiers of Cortes, arriving at the shores of America, rode their horses which they had brought from the Old World, the natives thought that gods had come to their country. They had never seen a horse. Of the horses the Spaniards brought to America some went astray, became wild, and filled the prairies, traveling in herds; the land and its vegetation and its climate proved to be exceedingly well suited for the propagation of this animal. In many parts of the Americas fossil hunters found fossilized bones of horses in great numbers, often im- bedded in rock or in lava, which do not differ in shape from the bones of the present-day horse. Why did the horse become extinct with the end of the Ice Age if the climate became so favorable? In earlier ages there were in America different-looking horses, with three-toed feet, also very small horses the size of cats. However, the one that looked exactly like a modern horse inhabited America and there became extinct 4 R. S.

Was not the American horse wiped out by man? In our time the American bison (buffalo) was almost de- stroyed by man, but he used horses to pursue them and firearms to kill them. C. O. Sauer has advanced the theory (1944) that the terminal Ice Age fauna was destroyed by man, by hunters making fire-drives in pursuit of game. However, Stone Age hunters burning down forests would not have been able to destroy completely many species of animal, leav- ing not one of the kind from one coast to another and from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego. F. Rainey, now of the University of Pennsylvania, has observed that \"in certain regions of Alaska the bones of these extinct animals lie so thickly scattered that there can be no question of human handiwork involved. Though man was on the scene of the final perishing, his was not, then, the appetite nor the capacity for such giant slaughter.\" 6 And because of the wholesale and rapid extermination of fauna, \"it seems impossible to attribute the phenomenon to the unaided efforts of man.\" 7 \"Even with the known destructiveness of man, however, it is difficult to visualize how these early hunters, armed with puny flint-tipped spears, could have destroyed enough animals to cause complete extinction. But whatever the actual cause or causes may have been, there is no doubt that the end of the ice masses also saw the end of the exotic animals of the same period. . . . The ice cliffs in the background have shriveled and gone. The trumpeting herds of mammoths and the pounding hooves of the other animals are no more.\" 8 L. C. Eiseley of the University of Kansas wrote: \"We are not dealing with a single, isolated relict species but with a considerable variety of Pleistocene [Ice Age] forms, all of which must be accorded, in the light of cultural evidence, an approximately similar time of extinction.\" 9 Then could it have been a disease that caused the ex- tinction?

Professor Eiseley finds that epidemic disease or climatic events attendant on the glacial retreat \"are sufficient to explain an enormous reduction in the number of a particular species, but are yet inadequate to illuminate the reason for the inability of the species to rebound, in a few years, from its decimated condition.\" w Besides, no known disease would attack so many species and genera. And as for the climatic factor, if glacial con- ditions are the cause, then, according to G. E. Pilgrim, \"at approximately the same time we witness a similar extinc- tion of the mammal faunas of Africa and Asia, though in their case this may not have been caused by glacial conditions.\" u But even a sudden climatic catastrophe all over the world could hardly have been adequate by itself to ac- count for an extermination so wide and, for many species, so complete. \"Climatic change alone is not enough to explain the extinction of the marvelous Pleistocene fauna. There have been other suggestions, such as clouds of volcanic gases which destroyed whole herds of mam- mals. . . .\" 12 Of what dimensions must these clouds have been? They must have covered almost the entire terrestrial globe. But all the volcanoes of the earth, erupting to- gether, would not be sufficient to destroy so many species and genera. Many agents of destruction must have united their forces with the sudden revolution of the climate to wipe out a major part of the animal population of the earth with many genera and species leaving no survivors. The extermination of great numbers of animals of every species, and of many species in their entirety, was the effect of recurrent global catastrophes. Of some species every animal was exterminated in one part of the world, but a number of animals succeeded in surviving in another part of the world; so the horses and camels of the Americas were destroyed without a survivor, yet in Eu- rasia, though decimated, they were not exterminated.

Lamarck (1744-1829) thought that acquired characteristics were transmissible by heredity and thus might lead to the appearance of new forms of life. In 1840, the year that Agassiz's Ice Age theory was pub- lished, an anonymously printed work, Vestiges of Creation written by Robert Chambers caused a stir that did not subside for years. It was bitterly attacked by every British scientist for teaching that human beings are \"the children of apes and the breeders of monsters,\" in the words of one critic, the president of the Geological Society, Adam Sedgwick. Darwin later acknowledged that the brunt of the attack against his own theory was absorbed by Vestiges. What was new in Darwin's teaching was not the prin- ciple of evolution in general but the explanation of its mechanism by natural selection. This was an adaptation to biology of the Malthusian theory about population 212"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"CATASTROpmsM AND EVOLUTION 213 growing more quickly than the means of existence. Dar- win acknowledged his debt to Malthus, whose book he read in 1838. Herbert Spencer and Alfred R. Wallace independently came to the same views as Darwin, and the expression \"survival of the fittest\" was Spencer's. Darwin wrote his theory with the point of his pen directed against the theory of catastrophism. He hardly expected that no opposition would come from the side he attacked, otherwise he would not have expended so many arguments in combating catastrophism and in sub- scribing so completely to Lyell's theory of uniformity in lifeless nature. As it turned out, most of the attacks against Darwin came from the Church, which could not agree that man had risen from inferior beings. The Church held to the dogmas of creation in six days less than six thousand years ago, and of the primal sin of Adam, to redeem humankind from which, the Son of Man came into this world; also to the view that beasts have no souls and therefore a barrier stands between man and animal. The emotions of this protracted controversy were spent on the issue: Is there evolution or is there not? More and more scientists subscribed to evolution; religious minds clung to the belief that there had been no change since the creation of the world. Actually the debate was between liberals and conservatives in the matter of science. The radicals did not participate; for catastrophism was dying out with the generation of the founders and classicists of geological science. Cuvier died in 1832; in England, geologists like Buckland of Oxford and Sedgwick of Cambridge, set in their belief in Mosaic tradition, as- cribed the ubiquitous vestiges of the catastrophe to the action of the Deluge. But they could not point to a satisfactory physical cause of such catastrophe, and expert estimate made it obvious that, had all the clouds over the earth emptied themselves simultaneously, the earth would not have been covered by even one foot of water. Then the geological record showed that there had been not one but several deluges. Lyell wrote in a letter: \"Cone- beare [geologist and Bishop of Bristol] admits three deluges before the Noachian! and Buckland adds God knows how many catastrophes besides, so we have driven them out of the Mosaic record fairly.\" 1 Sedgwick, according to 1 Life, Letters and Journals, I, 253."},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"214 CATACLYSMIC EVOLUTION Lyell, \"decided on four or more deluges.\" 2 In his last address as president of the Geological Society, Sedgwick admitted that his religious beliefs caused him to propagate a philosophic heresy: \"I think it right, as one of my last acts before I quit this Chair, thus publicly to read my recantation. We ought, indeed, to have paused before we adopted the diluvian theory, and referred all our old superficial gravel to the action of the Mosaic Flood. For of man, and the works of his hands, we have not yet found a single trace among the remnants of a former world entombed in these deposits.\" 3 So where were the remains of the sinful population? Cuvier taught that man's remains were never found with those of extinct animals. Lyell also declared in the first edition of his Principles that man was created after all the extinct animals passed away; and not until 1858, a year before the publication of Darwin's Origin of Species, did the finds in the Brixham cave shatter this belief in the non-coexistence of man and extinct, or \"antediluvian,\" animals. 4 In the year of the Origin, the leading English geologists were finally convinced by J. B. de Perthes, a notary of Abbeville in France, who for twenty years found only deaf ears, that human artifacts (worked flint) and extinct animals are met in the same formations, side by side. This opened wide the doors to Darwin's theory. By that time the doubts of the catastrophists, who could not understand why there were signs of more than one deluge and why there should be no human bones left of all the sinful generation that perished in the Flood, had already brought about the abandonment of the theory of catas- trophism, a theory that appeared to be in conflict with the Mosaic record. Thus it happened that the entire controversy for and against Darwinism failed to respond to the challenge of Darwin, who tried to show that what appeared to be the 2 Ibid. 3C. C.

The opposition was concentrated against the idea of evolution and in support of special creation. Insisting that all animals were created in the forms in which they are found in our days, the opponents of evolution waged their battle on geologically inde- fensible ground. But why did Darwin oppose the idea of great catas- trophes in the past, contrary to his own field observations, and subscribe to the theory of uniformity of geological events in all ages and in the present? For species to evolve as a result of incessant competition and struggle for survival, all the way from the simplest forms to Homo sapiens and other advanced organisms, an enormous span of time is required. The teaching of catastrophes appeared to make the story of the world very short: if the Deluge occurred less than five thousand years ago, then, following the book of Genesis, Creation took place less than six thousand years ago. In order to have at the disposal of the evolutionary process the almost unlimited time needed, Darwin accepted Lyell's teaching; and whereas Lyell tried to show that the usual agents such as rivers carrying sediment act with comparative speed, Darwin liked to stress their sluggishness. He wrote: \"Therefore a man should examine for him- self the great piles of superimposed strata, and watch the rivulets bringing down mud, and the waves wearing away the sea-cliffs, in order to comprehend something about the duration of past time.\" The waves of the sea reduce a rock particle by particle, and if a visible change is pro- duced, it requires many thousands of years. \"Nothing impresses the mind with the vast duration of time, according to our ideas of time, more forcibly than the conviction thus gained that subaerial agencies which apparently have so little power, and which seem to work so slowly, have produced great results.\" 5 Darwin even went so far as to suggest that \"he who can read Sir Charles Lyell's grand work on the Principles of Geology . . . and yet does not admit how vast have been the past periods of time, may at once close this volume [Origin of Species].\" 6 6 The Origin of Species, Chap.

However, though breeders have created new races or variations, they have created no new animal species. In the anatomy of living creatures \"the distinctness of the specific forms, and their not being blended together by innumerable transitional links, is a very obvious difficulty\" (Darwin); and thus the entire weight of proof was placed on the geological record. This record shows, however, \"The Forms of Life Chang- ing Almost Simultaneously throughout the World\" the title of a section in The Origin of Species. Darwin wrote: \"Scarcely any palaeontological discovery is more striking than the fact that the forms of life change almost simul- taneously throughout the world.\" This appears baffling, be- cause according to his theory \"the process of modification must be slow, and will generally affect only a few species at the same time; for the variability of each species is independent of that of all others.\" Could it not have been a sudden change in physical conditions that altered the forms of life at one and the same time throughout the world? Darwin answers, No. \"It is, indeed, quite futile to look to changes of currents, climate, or other physical conditions, as the cause of these great mutations in the forms of life throughout the world, under the most dif- ferent climates.\" If the climate or other physical condi- tions changed in one part of the world, how could this alter forms of life in all the other parts of the world? That a change in physical conditions could have occurred all over the world at one and the same time, Darwin did not even take into consideration. What kind of an answer to his problem, therefore, could Darwin propose? \"Blank intervals of vast duration, as far as the fossils are concerned, occurred. . . . During these long and blank intervals I suppose that the inhabitants of each region underwent a considerable amount of modification and extinction. . . .\" Hence the parallelism of changes in"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD 217 fauna and flora in similar strata around the world is not a true time-parallelism. 'The order would falsely appear to be strictly parallel.\" Darwin then considered \"The Absence of Numerous Intermediate Varieties in Any Single Formation,\" and wrote: \"If we confine our attention to any one formation, it becomes much more difficult to understand why we do not therein find closely graduated varieties between the allied species which lived at its commencement and at its close.\" And he found the answer in the conjecture that \"although each formation may mark a very long lapse of years, each probably is short compared with the period requisite to change one species into another.\" Furthermore, the geological record shows \"The Sudden Appearance of Whole Groups of Allied Species\" (the title of another section in The Origin of Species} . \"The abrupt manner in which whole groups of species suddenly appear in certain formations, has been urged by several palaeon- tologists for instance, by Agassiz, Pictet, and Sedgwick as a fatal objection to the belief in the transmutation of species. If numerous species, belonging to the same genera or families, have really started into life at once, the fact would be fatal to the theory of evolution through natural selection. For the development by this means of a group of forms, all of which are descended from some one progenitor, must have been an extremely slow progress; and the progenitors must have lived long before their modified descendants.\" Darwin explained this observation, too, by the incom- pleteness of the geological record, which, because of the lacunae, gives the appearance of sudden changes. The geological record of extinction of species is dis- cussed under the heading, \"On Extinction.\" Darwin wrote: \"The extinction of species has been involved in the most gratuitous mystery.\" What took place is \"apparently sud- den extermination of whole families or orders.\" According to his theory, \"the extinction of a whole group of species is generally a slower process than their production,\" and yet some groups were exterminated \"wonderfully sudden.\" Here, once more, Darwin thought that the imperfection of the geological record may in some cases simulate the suddenness of the extinction; but he acknowledged hi other cases his inability to explain the spontaneity of the"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"218 CATACLYSMIC EVOLUTION extinction of some species. He still wondered, as in the days of his South American travels, why horses had dis- appeared in pre-Columbian America where they had every favorable condition for propagation; and in a letter to Sir Henry H. Howorth he acknowledged his inability to explain the extinction of the mammoth, a well-adapted annual. But in general the deficiency of the geological record was invoked to explain the apparent spontaneity of extinction as well as the suddenness with which new species seem to have arrived on the scene. According to the theory of natural selection, chance variations or new characteristics among individuals of a species, if beneficial, are exploited in the struggle for survival and, being inheritable, may by accumulation lead to the origin of a new species. Because of the chance nature of these new characteristics and therefore also of the origin of the new species, Darwin assumed \"that not only all the individuals of the same species have migrated from some one area, but that allied species, although now inhabiting the most distant points, have proceeded from a single area the birthplace of their early progenitors. . . . The belief that a single birthplace is the law seems to me incomparably the safest.\" Darwin explained the migration of plants from con- tinent to continent and from mainland to islands by the transportation of seeds hi the intestines of birds; the migration of mollusks, by observed instances of small shells clinging to the legs of migrating birds. This method of dispersion does not account for the geographical dis- tribution of larger animals unable to fly or swim across the sea, or traverse climatic zones unsuitable for the species. Since animals of such species are found in very distant parts of the globe, divided by oceans, Darwin was led to maintain that \"during the vast geographical and climatal changes which have supervened since ancient times, almost any amount of migration is possible.\" This makes neces- sary the existence of land connections or \"land bridges\" between islands and mainlands and between all continents. But to these geographical and climatal changes, the Ice Age included, Darwin ascribed \"a subordinate\" role in shaping the development of the animals; they played an important role only in the migration of the animals."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD 219 Where the land is continuous, as in the Americas, Darwin accounted for the fact that identical animals live in higher latitudes of the Southern and Northern hemi- spheres, though they are absent in temperate and tropical latitudes, by resorting to a theory which assumes that the glacial periods in the Northern and Southern hemispheres were not simultaneous but consecutive. When a glacial period was descending upon the north, animals migrated slowly to the south, toward the equator; when the glacial period ended, and the climate in the subtropics became hot, some animals returned to the north, others remained in the subtropical regions, climbing the cool mountains. When the next glacial age this time advancing from the south arrived, the animals on the mountains came down, and when this age also ended, some of them moved to the south, while others again retreated to the mountains. Thus identical animals are found in the cooler regions of both the Northern and Southern hemispheres. (At present this view of consecutive glacial periods in the Northern and Southern hemispheres has hardly any adherents.) The theory of evolution by natural selection could not do well without the theory of the ice ages. It needed the Ice Age theory to explain the provenience of the same species in the Southern and Northern hemispheres sepa- rated by the Torrid Zone; it needed it even more to ac- count for the phenomenon of drift. Erratic blocks could have been explained, with some straining, by the action of icebergs. But drift, or accumulation of clay, boulders, and sand that in many places fills valleys hundreds of feet deep, could not have been brought in by icebergs; and, finally, icebergs, in order to be produced in great numbers, them- selves required extended glaciers from which they could break off. Darwinian evolution needed the Ice Age theory in order to supplant the tidal wave theory which is a catastrophic notion. Darwin accepted Agassiz's teaching, though not in its original form with a catastrophic beginning of the ice ages. But Agassiz rejected Darwin's theory. The reason for this he saw in the skeletal remains of ancient fish, a field in which he was an authority.

But these difficulties in the way of the evolutionary theory were less strongly felt in the heat of the fight against the opponents who insisted on a six- thousand-year-old world and the immutability of species. Darwin's theory represented progress as compared with the teachings of the Church. The Church assumed a world without change in nature since the Beginning. Darwin introduced the principle of slow but steady change in one direction, from one age to another, from one eon to another. In comparison with the Church's teaching of immutability, Darwin's theory of slow evolution through natural selection or the survival of the fittest was an advance, though not the ultimate truth. The story of his experiences is told by his contemporary and adherent, Thomas Huxley. Darwin was \"held up to scorn as a 'flighty' person, who endeavours 'to prop up his utterly rotten fabric of guess and speculation,' and whose 'mode of dealing with nature' is reprobated as 'utterly dishonourable to Natural Science.' \" Thus Huxley quoted from an article by Bishop Wilberforce in the Quarterly Review of July 1860. Huxley also wrote in 1887: \"On the whole, then, the supporters of Mr. Darwin's views in 1860 were numerically extremely insignificant. There is not the slightest doubt that, if a general council of the Church scientific had been held at that time, we should have been condemned by an overwhelming majority. And there is as little doubt that, if such a council gathered now, the decree would be of an exactly contrary nature.\" Darwin's Origin of Species, Huxley went on, \"was badly received by the generation to which it was first addressed, and the outpouring of angry nonsense to which it gave rise is sad to think upon. But the present generation will probably behave just as badly if another Darwin should arise, and inflict upon them that which the generality of mankind most hate the necessity of revising their convic- tions. Let them, then, be charitable to us ancients; and if they behave no better than the men of my day to some new benefactor, let them recollect that, after all, our wrath did not come to much, and vented itself chiefly in the bad language of sanctimonious scolds. Let them as speedily perform a strategic right-about-face, and follow the truth wherever it leads.

In the struggle for existence it eliminates all the unfit among the members of a species; and it destroys the species that cannot compete with others for the limited resources of livelihood. The winners in this struggle are those in- dividuals that because of some characteristic or favorable variation have an edge over other competitors. \"Under these circumstances favourable variations would tend to be preserved, and unfavourable ones destroyed. The re- sult of this would be the formation of new species\" (Darwin). As shown on previous pages, the annihilation of many individuals and of entire species in the animal kingdom took place, not only under circumstances of competition, but under catastrophic conditions as well. Entire species with no sign of degeneration suddenly came to their end in paroxysms of nature. Yet extinction of a species through starvation or extermination by enemies also takes place: Moa, the gigantic flightless bird of New Zealand that stood twelve feet high, was destroyed several cen- turies ago. The whooping cranes of North America were reduced by 1953 to twenty-one individuals. Natural selec- tion cannot account for the wholesale destruction of many genera and species at one time; it may occasionally be the agent exterminating single species. But can natural selection create new species? The geological record presents evidence that in the past animals lived that do not live any longer; and also that, of the forms living today, many did not exist in the past. Then how did they come into being? The animal and plant kingdoms are subdivided into phyla, and these into classes, orders, families, genera, and finally species. A species can be recognized this way; the l Thomas H. Huxley, \"On the Reception of the Origin of Species,\" printed as Chap.

Thus all the human race is but one species; and all races of dogs, so dissimilar in their body structures, are members of one species. There are hundreds of thousands of species in the animal kingdom and also in the plant kingdom. In the theory of evolution all forms of life evolved by gradual emergence from the same most primitive, one-cell living beings. Chance variations occur in members of every species no two individuals are entirely identical. These variations are inheritable. As already explained, the favorable variations those that are helpful in the struggle for existence may accumulate to such a degree that, according to Darwin, a new species originates, the members of which can have no fruitful progeny with the members of the parental species. Since the first scientific observations were made, no truly new animal species has been observed to come into being. The year after publication of The Origin of Species, Thomas Huxley wrote: \"But there is no positive evidence, at present, that any group of animals has, by variation and selective breeding, given rise to another group which was, even in the least degree, infertile with the first.\" l A few years later Darwin wrote in a letter (to Bentham) : \"The belief in natural selection must at present be grounded entirely on general considerations. . . . When we descend to details ... we cannot prove that a single species has changed; nor can we prove that the supposed changes are beneficial, which is the groundwork of the theory.\" 2 And at the end of the century Huxley found himself compelled to make the statement: \"I remain of the opinion . . . that until selective breeding is definitely proved to give rise to varieties infertile with one another, the logical foundation of the theory of natural selection is incomplete. We still remain very much in the dark about the causes of variation. . . .\" 8 In selective breeding the breeder creates conditions not found in wild life; and new races or varieties of animals 1 Thomas H.

Despite all their efforts, breeders have not been able to cross the true frontier of a species. Then how could a new species originate in chance variations and through crossbreeding in wild life? And how could so many new species be produced that they number, together with the extinct, in the millions? And how could a human being, so compli- cated, evolve, not just from common ancestors with the primates (apes), but from common ancestors with winged insects and crawling worms? The evolutionists drew more checks on time. Then, too, the chance character of variations, when they first appear in an individual, makes the envisaged progress especially difficult. Darwin professed ignorance as to the cause of these variations or new characteristics appearing in individuals; and it was generally understood that chance variations, in the vast majority of cases, must be in the nature of defects: in a complicated and balanced organism a chance variation would probably be a hin- drance, not a benefit. Then by what rare accidents could ever more perfected species have originated? Various theories have been offered one of them being evolution cr eat rice by Henri Bergson that assume the existence of a guiding principle in evolution, which re- places the chance and accident in variations; these theories are often united under the name orthogenesis, the best known of such ideas. The adherents of orthogenesis claim the existence of a plan and a goal. But since, in such a theory, Providence enters into action, and to make na- ture independent of it was a major objective of the theory of evolution as opposed to the teaching of special creation, after some deliberation orthogenesis, or creative evolu- tion, met largely with rejection. The orthogeneticists could argue that many traits, when they first appeared, must have been entirely useless, yet not senseless if they were destined to become useful after many generations. Then why should these traits have gone on developing from age to age, finally to become an asset to the species, unless orthogenesis was in action; why should the pocket of the kangaroo have increased in size through many generations until it could be used for carrying baby kangaroos?"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"224 CATACLYSMIC EVOLUTION The obvious difficulty in explaining the evolutionary process by chance variations brought about the revival of Lamarckism. In 1809, the year Darwin was born, Lamarck had published his Philosophic zoologique, in which he offered a theory of evolution through the appearance of new traits and faculties in response to usage; usage in response to need; and need as the consequence of changes in physical surroundings. These new acquired traits, he assumed, were inheritable. Lamarck also taught uni- formity, and thus he was an opponent of his contemporary, Cuvier, who taught catastrophism. Charles Darwin, gen- erous to Alfred R. Wallace, whom he declared to be an independent discoverer of the theory of natural selection, never agreed, despite the admonitions of Lyell and Huxley, to acknowledge his debt to Lamarck; in a letter to Lyell he referred to Lamarck's book as \"absurd\" and \"rubbish,\" and also as a \"wretched book.\" 4 However, Darwin of- fered the theory of pangenesis, according to which every cell in the body of an animal or plant sends a gemmule, an invisible image of the parent cell, to the germ cells. In this way Darwin intended to interpret heredity. Thus he went even farther than Lamarck in making the cells of the body the carriers of heredity, which amounts to hereditary transmission of acquired traits. The theory of pangenesis is definitely rejected by everyone. In the battle that went on among the representatives of different schools in evolution, the neo-Darwinists, led by August Weismann, attacked the neo-Lamarckists; and by cutting off the tails of mice in succeeding generations, Weismann could show that acquired traits are not in- heritable. Actually, he did not prove that much: the loss of tails by cutting is not a habit or trait acquired through usage or need. It was Weismann who really disproved Darwin's pangenesis theory, not Lamarck, but he properly stressed that the carriers of hereditary traits are in the germ plasma, or in spermatozoa and ova; the soma, or the body, is created in each successive generation by the germ plasma, and only changes in the plasma are inheritable. The chance variations of Darwin are such changes in the germ plasma and are therefore inherited; the response of 4 Darwin, Life and Letters, II, 199; L. T. More, The Dogma oj Evolution (1925), p. 172."},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"THE MECHANISM OF EVOLUTION 225 the body to external agents would not create inheritable traits and therefore must be of no value in evolution. On evolution as a geological fact all agreed, but on the mechanism of evolution the disagreement has been funda- mental. The majority of evolutionists have rejected the idea that acquired characteristics are inheritable; but Lamarck's ideas found followers in the East, in Michurin, who experimented on plants, and for a time in Pavlov, who experimented on animals, and not long ago in the dominant school of thought in Russia. The neo-Darwinists deny that physical surroundings can give rise to new species; they may bring about changes in an organism, but the acquired characteristics are not inheritable. Can, then, natural selection or competition with other animals create new species? The classic ex- ample of a giraffe with the longest neck surviving when leaves are left only high on the trees does not prove that giraffes with longer necks would become a separate species. And, in any event, under the described conditions no new race would evolve: the female giraffes, which are smaller in stature, would die out before the male competi- tors, and there would be no progeny; but should there be progeny, the young giraffes would probably die because they would be unable to reach the leaves. The position of Darwinists would be much stronger if a new animal species would appear, even if only in con- trolled breeding. Darwin claimed that the process of the appearance of new species is very slow, but he also main- tained that the process of extinction of a species is even slower. 5 Nevertheless, some species of animals have ex- pired before the eyes of the naturalists, but no new one has appeared. The theory of natural selection, even the very fact of the evolvement of one species from another, needed proof. Some scientists went so far as to say that possibly the entire development plan has already reached its permanent stage, and the geological records tell only of the road to that stage, evolution no longer taking place. One part of the Darwinian theory of selection has been generally abandoned: it is the idea of sexual selec- tion as a factor in evolution. In natural selection the com- petition is for the means for existence. In sexual selection a theory developed in The Descent of Man (1871) 5 The Origin of Species, Chapter XI."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"226 CATACLYSMIC EVOLUTION the competition is among the males for acceptance by a female. Darwin thought to explain the origin of various secondary sexual characteristics, such as ornamentation and color of feathers in birds, by saying that they were the results of gradual selection, through many genera- tions, of traits attractive in the eyes of the female. But it was shown that when the colorful wings of male butter- flies were cut off and in their stead female wings, often without the characteristic coloring, were glued to the body of the male butterfly, the female did not object to the approach of the male. She failed to discriminate against male butterflies with no wings at all. Also it was observed that some male fish fertilize the fish eggs, hav- ing all the male coloring characteristic of such season, but without the female fish being present or aware of the act of fertilization. The theory of sexual selection to a certain degree had the same fate as the theory of gem- mules. But the theory of natural selection would not yield its position unless a better explanation of the evolutionary mechanism could be given. Mutations and New Species The first ray of light came at the turn of the century, when Hugo De Vries, a Dutch botanist, observed spon- taneous mutations in the evening primrose. The plant, without a recognizable cause, would show new character- istics unobserved in its ancestors. Although De Vries claimed that these mutations amount to what may be called \"little species,\" they have not caused the primrose to pass beyond the frontier of its species. However, it was demonstrated that variations within a species do ap- pear in a spontaneous manner, and rather suddenly, and not, as Darwin thought, by minute progressions from generation to generation. Huxley was correct in urging Darwin not to adhere so dogmatically to his belief that nature does not make jumps natura non facit saltum. 1 De Vries showed that variations are in the nature of jumps, and from this he developed the mutation theory of evolution. l Darwin, Life and Letters, II, 27."},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"MUTATIONS AND NEW SPECIES 227 De Vries, while working on his theory, was as yet un- aware of Gregor Mendel's investigations in genetics, al- ready published as a paper in 1865, only six years after The Origin of Species. Mendel's work, unknown to Dar- win and his followers in the nineteenth century, was rediscovered by De Vries and independently by E. Tscher- mak and by K. Correns in 1900, the same year that De Vries wrote down his theory of mutations. By carefully observing crossings between varieties of the garden pea and counting the strains through consecutive generations and the transmission of single traits, Mendel established the fundamental laws of genetics or inheritance of somatic characteristics. The entire work on evolution since the beginning of this century is based on genetics and Men- del's laws. Ironically, Mendel was an Augustine monk and made his basic contribution at a time when the war be- tween science and the Church was raging, following the publication of Darwin's main work. The spontaneous varia- tions in mutants can be followed through as hereditary factors in successive generations of offspring. The genes in the germ plasma are the carriers of the traits, and a variation (mutation) in a gene would cause a variation (mutation) in the offspring. But, generally, only single variations appear at a time; they may lead to new races, not to new species. Spontaneous mutations are far too few and insufficient in magnitude to bring about the appearance of new species and to explain how the world of animals came into exist- ence. Despite all spontaneous variations no new species of mammals are known to have been created since the close of the Ice Age. In 1 907, V. L. Kellogg of Stanford University came to the following conclusion: \"The fair truth is that the Darwinian selection theories, considered with regard to their claimed capacity to be an independently sufficient mechanical explanation of de- scent, stand today seriously discredited in the biological world. On the other hand, it is also fair truth to say that no replacing hypothesis or theory of species forming has been offered by the opponents of selection which has met with any general or even considerable acceptance by natu- ralists. Mutations seem to be too few and far between; for orthogenesis we can discover no satisfactory mechan- ism; and the same is true for the Lamarckian theories of"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"228 CATACLYSMIC EVOLUTION modification by the cumulation, through inheritance, of acquired or ontogenic characters.\" 2 Kellogg also observed that one group of scientists \"denies in toto any effectiveness or capacity for species forming on the part of natural selection, while the other group, a larger . . . sees in natural selection an evolu- tionary factor capable of initiating nothing, dependent wholly for any effectiveness on some primary factor or factors controlling the origin and direction of variation, but capable of extinguishing all unadopted, unfit lines of development. . . . For my part,\" Kellogg concluded, \"it seems better to go back to the old and safe Ignoramus standpoint.\" Thus the entire problem was shunted back to the place it occupied before The Origin of Species. Evolution is the principle. Darwin's contribution to the principle is natural selection as the mechanism of evo- lution. If natural selection, sharing the fate of sexual se- lection, is not the mechanism of the origin of species, Darwin's contribution is reduced to very little only to the role of natural selection hi weeding out the unfit. H. Fairficld Osborn, a leading American evolutionist, wrote: \"In contrast to the unity of opinion on the law of evolution is the wide diversity of opinion on the causes of evolution. In fact, the causes of the evolution of life are as mysterious as the law of evolution is certain.\" 3 And again: \"It may be said that Darwin's law of selection as a natural explanation of the origin of all fitness in form and function has also lost its prestige at the present time, and all of Darwinism which now meets with universal acceptance is the law of the survival of the fittest, a limited application of Darwin's great idea as expressed by Her- bert Spencer.\" 4 These were not the opinions of single evolutionists, but generally held views. William Bateson, a leading English evolutionist, in his address before the American Associa- tion for the Advancement of Science in 1921, said: \"When students of other sciences ask us what is now currently believed about the origin of species we have no clear answer to give.

I have put be- fore you very irankly the considerations which have made us agnostic as to the actual mode and processes of evolution.\" 6 L. T. More, in a series of guest lectures delivered at Princeton University, asked: \"If natural selection is a force which can destroy but cannot create species and if the reasons for this destruc- tion are unknown, of what value is the theory to man- kind? . . . The collapse of the theory of natura selection leaves the philosophy of mechanistic materialism in a sorry plight.\" 6 On De Vries's theory of evolution by mutations More said: \"The idea is destructive to scientific theory, as it really does away with the whole idea of continuity which should be the basis of an evolution theory. . . . The thought at once occurs that each of the surprising breaks in the paleontological record, such an one as separates the rep- tile from the feathered bird, may have been taken at a single leap during an overstimulated period of nature.\" 7 De Vries made observations of spontaneous mutations in plants; a decade later T. H. Morgan found spontaneous mutations in Drosophila melanogaster, the vinegar fly, including various colorings of the eyes and various lengths of wings, and many other changes in progeny not present in any of the ancestors. H. J. Muller, by subjecting the vinegar fly to the action of x-rays, increased the fre- quency of mutations one hundred and fifty times. It was also found that some chemicals and temperatures close to the limits that the insect organism can endure may act as mutation-provoking agents. Muller concluded that spontaneous mutations are \"usually due to an accidental individual molecular or submolecular collision, occurring in the course of thermal agitation,\" and this is indicated \"by the amount of rise in the frequency of mutations that is observed when the temperature is raised, so long as temperatures normal to the organism are not transgressed. Since chemical changes similar to but more extreme than those of thermal agila- 5 William Bateson, \"Evolutionary Faith and Modern Doubts,\" Science, LV, 55. 6 More, The Dogma of Evolution (1925), p. 240. 7 Ibid., p. 214"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"230 CATACLYSMIC EVOLUTION tion may also be produced by x-rays and other high- energy radiation and by ultra-violet, it is not surprising that mutations like the so-called 'spontaneous' ones can be induced in great abundance by these means, and that the number of these mutations is, in general, proportional to the number of physical 'hits' caused by the radiation.\" 8 The origin of mutations in the evening primrose, ob- served by De Vries, like every other spontaneous mutation, must be ascribed to one of those irritants acting di- rectly on the genes. It could have been the result of hits by cosmic rays; only it must be shown why the evening primrose is more susceptible to such an agent than most other plants. The practical absence of x-rays in surrounding nature caused this powerful agent of mutations in laboratories to be regarded as not operative in spontaneous mutations and therefore also not in the process of evolution. Muller stressed this point. However, an x-ray component is pres- ent in radium radiation. At the beginning of the present century it was noticed that tadpoles or embryonic frogs in the presence of a tube containing radium give rise to various freaks. 9 Radioactivity and cosmic radiation are agents present in nature, one of terrestrial, the other of extraterrestrial, origin. If, as the experiments with the vinegar fly demon- strated, a mutation of some gene can produce a wingless fly, many mutations simultaneously or in quick suc- cession would be quite able to transform an animal or plant into a new species. In the bomb craters of London new plants, not previously known on the British Isles, and possibly not known anywhere, were seen to sprout. \"Rare plants, unknown to modern British botany, were discovered in the bomb craters and ruins of London in 1943.\" 10 It appears that the thermal action of bomb ex- plosions was the cause of multiple metamorphoses in the genes of seeds and pollens. If this is so, then the state- ment made earlier that no new species has been observed in the process of making its first appearance must be re- tracted. 8 Muller, \"The Works of the Genes,\" in H.

These charges, arriving from outside the earth, are very strong per particle, averaging several billions of electron volts and sometimes carrying a potential of a hundred billion electron volts. As comparatively few such rays or charges hit our atmosphere, then* general effect is not spectacular. But it is conceivable that, where a cosmic ray or charge hits a gene of germ plasma, a biological muta- tion takes place, comparable to the physical transmutation of the elements. After all, the genes, like any pro- teins, are biochemical compounds composed of carbon, nitrogen, and a few other elements. Should a somatic chromosome be hit by a powerful charge, it might at worst cause disorganized growth and be the origin of a neoplasma; but if the genes of the germ plasma should be the target of a collision with a cosmic ray or secondary radiation, a mutation in the progeny might ensue; and should many such hits occur, the origin of a new species, most probably incapable of individual or genetic life, but in some cases capable, could be expected. Thus, increased radioactivity coming from outside this planet or from the bowels of the earth could be the cause of the spontaneous origin of new species. Should an interplanetary discharge take place between the earth and another celestial body, such as a planet, a planetoid, a trail of meteorites, or a charged cloud of gases, with possibly billions of volts of potential difference and nuclear fission or fusion, the effect would be similar to that of an explosion of many hydrogen bombs with ensuing procreation of monstros- ities and growth anomalies on a large scale. What matters is that the principle that can cause the origin of species exists in nature. The irony lies in the cir- cumstance that Darwin saw in catastrophism the chief adversary of his theory of the origin of species, being led by the conviction that new species could evolve as a result of competition with accidental characteristics serv- ing as weapons only if almost limitless time were at the disposal of that competition, with no catastrophes inter- vening.

In order for a simul- taneous mutation of many characteristics to occur, with a new species as a resultant, a radiation shower of ter- restrial or extraterrestrial origin must take place. There- fore we are led to the belief that evolution is a process initiated in catastrophes. Numerous catastrophes or bursts of effective radiation must have taken place in the geo- logical past in order to change so radically the living forms on earth, as the record of fossils embedded in lava and sediment bears witness. How would this understanding of evolution meet the facts, and especially those facts that always appeared to be in discord with the theory of natural selection? The fact that some organisms, like foraminifera, sur- vived all geological ages without participating in evolution, a point of perplexity in the theory of natural selec- tion, would be explained by catastrophic evolution in which many species would be destroyed, others would be subjected to multiple mutations, and some specimens of species would escape mutations and procreate their old form. The fact that the geological record shows a sudden emergence of many new forms at the beginning of each geological age does not require the artificial explanation that the records are always defective; the geological rec- ords truly reflect the changes in the animal and plant worlds from one period of geological time to the next. Many of the new species evolved in the wake of a global catastrophe, at the beginning of a new age, were en- tombed in a subsequent paroxysm of nature at the end of that age. The fact that in many cases the intermediary links be- tween present-day species are missing, as well as those between various species of the geological record, a vexing problem, is understandable in the light of sudden and multiple variations that gave rise to new species. It was objected that if a new characteristic appeared in only a single animal, as the theory of natural selection claims, or even in a few animals of the same species, it would disappear in succeeding generations through inter- breeding unless the new animal had been protected by isolation on secluded islands. However, in catastrophic evolution, the simultaneous mutation of many genes could produce a new species at the first fertilization; all the off-"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"234 CATACLYSMIC EVOLUTION spring of a litter could be affected similarly. And it is not inconceivable that in more than one creature of the same species, under similar circumstances of radiation, similar changes in the genes would occur; so in the x-ray experi- ments on Drosophila, similar mutations occurred in more than one fly. The objection to the theory of natural selection, that the developed plan in a new species must appear sud- denly or the race would expire as in the case of the kangaroo pockets is answerable within the framework of catastrophic evolution; however, the purposefulness of animal structures will remain a problem deserving of as much wonder as, for instance, the purposeful behavior of leucocytes in the blood that rush to combat a noxious in- truder. The fact stressed by Agassiz that numerous earlier species of fish showed a more highly developed organism when compared with later species of fish can be explained by the destruction of earlier forms, not in the process of competition, but in upheavals against which superior structure is no defense. The observation that healthy species of animals, like mammoths, with no sign of degeneration suddenly be- came extinct greatly troubled the evolutionists. This fact is unexplainable by natural selection or the principle of competition; not so by the catastrophic intervention of nature. The fact that at several stages of the past many ani- mals of various species and many species in toto were rather suddenly exterminated, in conflict with the idea of slow extinction in natural selection, conforms with the theory of cataclysmic evolution. The enigmatic observation that the larger animals were particularly subject to extinction the giant mammals that succumbed at the end of the Tertiary, and again in the Pleistocene, as earlier the dinosaurs did is compre- hensible if one thinks of the better chances smaller ani- mals have of finding refuge from the ravages of nature. Natural selection had its role, too, but not in procreat- ing new species; it was a decisive factor in the survival or dying out of new forms, in the struggle for existence, not only between individuals, races, species, and orders, but also against the elements.

The origin of new species from old could be caused by the processes that can be duplicated in laboratories by excessive radiation or some other irritant in abnormal doses, thermal or chemical, all of which must have taken part in natural catastrophes of the past, and could have played a role in building new species, as the case of new plants in the bomb craters appears to indicate. The theory of evolution is vindicated by catastrophic events in the earth's past; the proclaimed enemy of this theory proved to be its only ally. The real enemy of the theory of evolution is the teaching of uniformity, or the non-occurrence of any extraordinary events in the past. This teaching, called by Darwin the mainstay of the theory of evolution, almost set the theory apart from reality. Great catastrophes of the past accompanied by elec- trical discharges and followed by radioactivity could have produced sudden and multiple mutations of the kind achieved today by experimenters, but on an immense scale.

Following the trail of geology, we were led by the merciless logic of facts and figures to the conclusion that the earth was more than once a stage on which acts of a great drama took place, and no place on earth was free of its effects. In the face of the evidence we were also compelled to concede that the most recent paroxysms of nature hap- pened in historical times, only a few thousand years ago, when in some parts of the world civilization was already entering the Iron Age, but in other parts still lingering in the Neolithic or even in the Paleolithic, or rude stone, Age. The laminations of lakes, the salt content of those without outflow, the retreat of waterfalls, the elevation of mountains, pollen analysis, and archaeological finds, as well as the recent drop of the ocean level, all show how close to our time must have occurred the more recent paroxysms of nature. The evidence is also overwhelming that the great global catastrophes were either accompanied or caused by shift- ing of the terrestrial axis or by a disturbance in the diur- nal and annual motions of the earth. The shifting of the axis could not have been brought about by internal causes, as the proponents of the Ice Age theory in the nineteenth century assumed it was; it must have occurred, and repeatedly, under the impact of external forces. The state of lavas with reversed magnetization, hundreds of times more intensive than the inverted terrestrial mag- netic field could impart, reveals the nature of the forces that were in action. Thus from the geological evidence we came to the con- clusion to which we had also arrived traveling the road of the historical and literary traditions of the peoples of the world that the earth repeatedly went through cataclys- mic events on a global scaJe, that the cause of these events was an extraterrestrial agent, and that some of these cosmic catastrophes took place only a few thousand years ago, in historical times.

Laplace's contemporary, Jean Baptiste Lamarck (1744- 1829), set out to demonstrate in a series of works that this earth has ever been an abode of peaceful evolution, free from spasmodic disturbances, in opposition to the dominant views of his day. These ideas of harmony or stability in the celestial and terrestrial spheres gained ground in the nineteenth cen- tury and became the foundation of scientific thought. In 1846 Leverrier, by announcing the existence of the planet Neptune, which was immediately thereafter discovered in the part of the sky indicated by him, proved the gravitational theory of Newton and the orderly universe of Laplace to be correct. However, in the same year, by detecting the anomaly in the revolution of Mercury, al- ways accumulating in one and the same direction, he threw the first doubt on the infallibility of these very laws. The theory of uniformity, as understood by Lamarck and Hutton and developed by Lyell, became the corner- stone of the Darwinian theory, and Darwin went so far as to say that anybody who was unconvinced by Lyell's teaching should refrain from reading the Origin of Spe- cies. The principle of uniformity, or the explanation of all past events in the history of the globe in terms of the processes in action in our own age, or the denial of catastrophic crises in the past, gave Darwin what he needed most for his idea of the origin of species: almost unlimited time. In order that from the struggle for exist- 243"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"244 SUPPLEMENT ence, or competition, new forms should evolve, and that an animal like the spider with its many legs and human beings should have had a common ancestor, untold eons were necessary. By the end of the nineteenth century the war between the theory of evolution and the theory of creation hi six days, less than six thousand years ago, was concluded, with victory to the theory of evolution. The only diffi- culty left was, hi the view of Thomas Huxley, that no really new species had appeared on the world scene since the scientific observations were made, not even hi breed- ing experiments. The geological record, however, spoke unequivocally of the fact: in the past lived animal forms that do not live any longer, and of the forms that live in our age, many were not present in the geological past. Laplace's theory of the origin of the solar system from a rotating nebula was replaced, by the end of the cen- tury, with a theory of a catastrophic beginning in a near- collision of the sun with another star, with debris forming the planets. But it was stressed by the authors of this new theory that the universe is orderly, and this beginning in a cataclysm was an unusually rare occurrence in the cos- mos, and that the solar system is governed by the prin- ciple of stability, as annunciated by Laplace, and the earth by the law of uniformity, and the animals and plants by the law of evolution through continuity. It appeared that, basic principles having been estab- lished, science had before it only the work of refinement in observation and in the addition of details for the per- fection of knowledge; but the time of basic discoveries was over. This was the outlook in 1895. In April of that year Fridtjof Nansen, in an attempt to discover the North Pole, reached a point less than four degrees from it. The scientific world looked upon the discovery of the North Pole as the most coveted goal still left to be attained by science. But before Nansen, drifting from latitude 86 14', reached his home in Norway, the scene changed. Konrad Roentgen of Wiirzberg discovered the x-rays or cathode rays that pass through opaque bodies. In the same year of 1895 twenty-year-old Marconi, working at the home of his father near Bologna, made the first successful ex- periment with wireless transmission. That year, too, Sig-"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"FORUM ADDRESS 245 mund Freud published his first paper (together with Joseph Breuer), which led to a new understanding of the realm known as the subconscious; and at the same time Pavlov made his contribution to the psychology of the reflexes. The next year, and still before Nansen had landed on the Norwegian coast, Henri Becquerel, working on ura- nium, discovered the phenomenon of radioactivity. Two years later he was followed by the Curies, who discovered radium. In 1897 J. J. Thomson announced that the atom is divisible and is actually a microcosm, and he was fol- lowed by Rutherford. In 1900 Planck presented the theory of quanta, or energies dispatched in bundles or shots, and not in a continuous stream. And in the field of the origin of species, in 1900, Van Vries announced mutations in plants, observed for the first time: a process of spontaneous changes in living nature fundamentally different from the process of evolution through continu- ity as postulated by Darwin. Thus in a few years, in a spectacular series of dis- coveries, the entire world matter and energy and living species and the human soul opened new horizons and everything appeared to be in incessant vibration, collisions, and transformation: the macrocosm, the microcosm, and even the subtle world of the mind, all alike. And in 1905 Albert Einstein, then twenty-six years old, offered his understanding of the physical world, an understanding that required a new mental approach, as a testimonial that the age of basic discoveries had not ended with the victory of Darwin over the Book of Genesis. Since then another fifty years have passed. Once more, as before the end of the nineteenth century, we are told that the fundamentals are all known; the age of basic dis- coveries is definitely terminated, this time for certain; and present and future generations will have to satisfy them- selves with detecting details, accumulating data, and add- ing decimals. And though the exciting decade of 1895 to 1905 threw light on processes in matter, life, and soul, processes that are certainly not inert and are marked by spontaneity and conflict, science in its various branches adjusted the new discoveries and ideas to the framework of the old great principle reigning equally in lifeless and"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"246 SUPPLEMENT living nature: the law of harmony and unperturbed stabil- ity. The time was ripe for heresy. In 1950, a book, Worlds in Collision, created an out- burst of emotions almost unprecedented in science. In the Preface to the book I wrote: \"Harmony or stability in the celestial and terrestrial spheres is the point of depar- ture of the present-day concept of the world as expressed in the celestial mechanics of Newton and the theory of evolution of Darwin. If these two men of science are sacrosanct, this book is a heresy.\" I came upon the idea that traditions and legends and memories of generic origin can be treated in the same way in which we treat in psychoanalysis the early memories of a single individual. I spent ten years on this work. I found that the collective memory of humankind spoke of a series of global catastrophes that occurred in historical times. I believed that I could even identify the exact tunes and the very agents of the great upheavals of the more recent past. The conclusions at which I arrived compelled me to cross the frontiers into various fields of science - archaeology, geology, and astronomy. The result was a book, a prolegomenon. In its concluding pages I con- ceded that more problems were raised than had been solved, and I promised, always reckoning with the limita- tions of the individual scholar, to pursue my study into these fields too. But already the implications of the fact of great global catastrophes on the earth, one of the celes- tial bodies, in a tune so recent, had caused my critics to assert, in the words of a Harvard astronomer, that here was the \"most amazing example of a shattering of ac- cepted concepts on record.\" In the heat of the debate in the press the book was pro- nounced \"one of the most significant books written since the invention of printing,\" and also \"the worst book since the invention of movable characters.\" Believing that an emotional atmosphere is not well suited to fruitful debate, I have entered only infrequently into the controversy.

Haldane appearing in their reviews of my book, and I participated in a debate with your professor of astron- omy, J. Q. Stewart, in the pages of Harper's Magazine (June 1951).

Now more than three and a half years have passed since the publication of the book, and I appreciate the opportunity offered me by your invitation to present a dispassionate review of recent finds in the three fields named in the title of my address. Worlds in Collision and Recent Finds in Archaeology In my book I described the great natural catastrophes of the second and first millennia before the present era. Prominent place is given to the description of the natu- ral upheaval that occurred in the closing hours of the Middle Kingdom in Egypt. I synchronized this event with the Exodus, when sea, land, and sky were in uproar. The collective human memory retained an inexhaustible array of recollections of the time when the world was in con- flagration, when sea engulfed land, earth trembled, celes- tial bodies were disturbed in their motion, and meteorites fell. My narrative is based on historical texts of many peoples around the globe, on classical literature, on epics of northern races, on sacred books of the Orient and Occident, on traditions and folklore of primitive peoples. The question that arose was: Where is the archaeolog- ical evidence? In later chapters of my book I gave such evidence: water clocks and sundials that show a different length of the day or altered latitudes; change in the ori- entation of ancient temples which originally faced toward the east but do so no longer. I also closely examined in my book the calendars of the civilized peoples of an- tiquity, from Mexico and Peru to Greece, Iran, Israel, Egypt, Babylon, Assyria, India, and China, and the cal- endar reforms that were made. All this material gave strong support to the literary evidence. Working independently of me, Professor Claude Schaeffer, whose earlier excavations at Ras Shamra (Ugarit) caused a complete revolution in biblical exegesis, published a volume, Stratigraphie compares et chronolo-"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"248 SUPPLEMENT gie de I'Asie Occidental (III* and //' millenaires), printed by the Oxford University Press. 1 In this very detailed and technical work, comprising, together with tables, almost a thousand pages, Schaeffer demonstrates that on several occasions, each marking the end of an epoch, the entire ancient East was shaken and devastated. Modern annals of seismology know nothing comparable in severity and extent. The most devastating of these upheavals took place at exactly the end of the Middle Kingdom in Egypt* causing its downfall as claimed in Worlds in Collision and Ages in Chaos. Cities were overturned; epidemics left the dead piled in common graves; the pursuit of arts and commerce came to an abrupt end; empires ceased to exist; strata of earth, dust, and ashes yards thick covered the ruined cities. In many places the population was annihilated, in others it was decimated; settled living was replaced by nomadic existence. Climate changed. Claude Schaeffer analyzed the archaeological finds of every place excavated from Troy at the Dardanelles over all Asia Minor, Armenia, the Caucasus, Persia, Syria, Cyprus, and Palestine to Egypt in Africa; he summarizes his extensive volume thus: \"Our inquiry has demonstrated that these repeated crises which opened and closed the principal periods of the third and second millennia v/ere not caused by the action of man. Far from it, because compared with the vastness of these all-embracing crises and their profound effects, the exploits of conquerors . . . would appear only insignificant.\" Schaeffer's work sheds a new light on the conclusions at which Sir Arthur Evans arrived after many years of archaeological work on Crete: the island was shattered in violent catastrophes that were accompanied by fire, and in these upheavals the cultural and political ages of the 1 Schaeffer's book was published in 1948; my attention was drawn to it in 1951 by Dr. W. Federn. My first publication claiming natural catas- trophes that overwhelmed the ancient East the greatest of which caused the downfall of the Middle Kingdom in Egypt was printed in January 1946 as Theses lor the Reconstruction of Ancient History, a monograph published in the series Scrlpta Academlca Hierosolymitana. It embodies the entire plan of Ages In Chaos in the form of a summary. As to the causes of the catastrophes, Schaeffer wrote: \"Nous ne distinguons encore qu 'imperf aitement les causes initiales et replies de certaines de ces grandes crises.\""},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"FORUM ADDRESS 249 Minoan kingdom went down, at the same time that cor- responding Egyptian ages were terminated. Troy III was destroyed and its fifty feet thick fortress wall fell when the Middle Kingdom in Egypt fell; the volcano on the island of Thera exploded with almost unimaginable fury; recent archaeological work in the Indus Valley showed, too, that about 1500, and in advance of the Arian in- vasion, cities with great walls were destroyed and a flourishing civilization came to a sudden end. The synchronization of the Exodus with the end of the Middle Kingdom was also the starting point of a recon- struction of ancient history from that point on to the advent of Alexander the Great, which took the form of a two-volume work, Ages in Chaos, the first volume of which was published in the spring of 1952. The problem of the time of the Exodus in Egyptian history had never been solved. In the Papyrus Ipuwer and the Naos of El Arish I found descriptions of a natural upheaval very similar, sometimes identical, with the description hi the Book of Exodus: following plagues, when the river was blood-colored, amid a hurricane and darkness of seven days' duration, the pharaoh and his host were drowned in a whirlpool at Pi-ha-Kiroth, the same place where the pharaoh of the Exodus was drowned. These parallels compelled me to fix an unorthodox date for the Exodus. Collating the historical texts of following generations for twelve hundred years, I could establish numerous correla- tions between the histories of Egypt and of Israel which could not be accidental; my reconstruction demonstrated that Egyptian history and the histories of the nations which are written in harmony with it are out of line with the historical past by about six to seven hundred years. Thus both my works have their starting point in the recognition that the Middle Kingdom in Egypt went down in a great natural catastrophe. The recent excavation hi Jericho has confirmed the fact that the great walls of the city fell a few decades after the end of the Middle Kingdom. But at the time in which conventional chronology places the arrival of the Israelites under Joshua in Canaan, there was no city at Jericho and no walls to fall.

I believe that when the Minoan writings unearthed in Mycenae are deciphered they will be found to be Greek. I also claim that these texts are of a later date than gen- erally believed. \"No 'Dark Age' of six centuries' dura- tion intervened in Greece between the Mycenaean age and the Ionian age of the seventh century.\" 2 Before long new evidence will come from the so-called Hittite pictographic writings found in Asia Minor, Meso- potamia, and northern Syria. Since the recent discovery in Karatepe in Asia Minor of bilingual inscriptions in ancient Hebrew and in pictographs efforts at decipher- ment have entered a new stage. Today the Hittite picto- graphs are already in the process of being read. In my reconstruction I come to the conclusion that they are Chaldean signs, not Hittite. I also expect unequivocal evidence that these signs were used down to the last cen- tury before the present era. Owing to the confusion in the conventional chronology, the Chaldean writings of the Neo-Babylonian Empire are ascribed to early cen- turies and an imaginary empire. W. F. Libby and his associates at the University of Chicago have developed the radiocarbon method of dat- ing organic matter. Wood from under the foundation of the \"Hittite\" fortress of Alisar in Asia Minor turned out to be seven to eight hundred years younger than con- ventional chronology would allow, 8 thus giving full sup- port to my dating. Hittite history, interwoven with Egyp- tian history of the New Kingdom, cannot be shortened without at the same time shortening the history of Egypt. The age of pieces of wood from the tombs of the Old and Middle Kingdoms in Egypt also proved to be in harmony with my reconstruction. However, for the decisive period that of the New Kingdom no radiocarbon analysis has been made. * Quoted from my Theses for the Reconstruction of Ancient History, published as an advance summary of Ages in Chaos, and referred to in the foregoing footnote. 8W.

As soon as the archaeologists started a methodic in- vestigation of the area, in Yakutsk itself was found a workshop of an ancient metallurgist in which, at the end of the second millennium before the present era, he made bronze axes similar to the axes manufactured about that time in the Near East and in Europe. \"In the Yakutsk taiga two and a half [or three] thou- sand years ago, there already lived artisans in metals who were able to extract copper from ore, to melt it and pour it into forms, and to make axes, beautiful bronze tips for the spears, knives and even swords.\" 6 These relics of a civilization in the taiga of northeastern Siberia imply that the climate changed there in the age of advanced man.

Palms were found to have grown in northern Green- land, where now for half a year there is darkness and it is permanently cold. At some time in the remote past corals grew in Spitsbergen, and sequoia forests in Alaska; and it was early understood that the terrestrial axis must have changed its position. Airy, Lord Kelvin, George Darwin, and many others, including Schiaparelli and Simon Newcomb, participated in a long debate on the astronomical and geological possibility of a sud- den change in the direction of the terrestrial axis, a de- bate that was erroneously thought to have been started as a consequence of Worlds in Collision, It was under- stood that such a change must have taken place unless the strange finds are to be left without explanation.

But the mobile force he invoked the tidal in- equalities of lunar origin would not have moved the latitudes out of their places, the directional pull being east-west. W. B. Wright, in his The Quaternary Ice Age (2nd ed., 1937), says that during geological history there occurred many changes in the position of the climatic zones on the surface of the earth which cannot be ex- plained except by a shifting of the axis or a displace- ment of the pole from its present position. But what could have brought about a change in the inclination of the terrestrial axis to the plane of the ecliptic? I discussed this question in the closing pages of Worlds in Collision and suggested the entrance of the earth into a strong magnetic field. The newly developed science of paleomagnetism brought, and daily continues to bring, confirmation of the fact that lavas and igneous rocks in all parts of the world are reversely magnetized. But what is even more startling is to find that the reversely magnetized rocks are a hundred times more strongly magnetized than the"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"FORUM ADDRESS 255 earth's magnetic field could have caused them to be. H. Manley, in his review, writes: \"It may seem strange that a rock which is made mag- netic by the earth's field\" should become so strongly magnetized \"compared with the generating force. This is one of the most astonishing problems of paleomagnet- ism.\" 4 Manley also refers to the tests made years ago by G. Folgheraiter and P. L. Mercanton on the clay of ancient Etruscan vases. They were found to have been fired when the vases were closer to the south magnetic pole; their position during the firing is known, because of the flow of the glaze; and the magnetic dip or inclination of the clay is found. Manley writes: \"This implies that in the sixth century B.C. the earth's magnetic field was reversed in the Central Mediterranean area.\" He speaks also of a general \"reversal in historical times, 2500 years ago,\" that must be cleared up by additional re- search. Knowing from my study of ancient literary sources the proper time of exogenous disturbances in terrestrial ro- tation, I suspected an inaccuracy in the last sentence of an otherwise well-written article by Manley: the reversal must have occurred in the eighth century and again in the beginning of the seventh century (687). I was grati- fied to find, in the original publication of Professor Mercanton, to whom I directed my inquiry, that the vases with reversed polarity date from the eighth century. 5 I expect that, should the research be extended to vases dating from the end of the Middle Kingdom in Egypt (circa 3500 years ago), other periods of \"unnatural\" polarity would be determined in Egypt and elsewhere. Professor R. Daly of Harvard University found that 3500 years ago all over the world the level of the oceans suddenly dropped. He thought it might be due to a sud- den sinking of the crust. And in an authoritative work, Marine Geology (1950), Professor P. H. Kuenen of the Netherlands finds that \"this recent shift is now well established\" on observations in many places of the world, and he, too, assigns this catastrophic drop of the ocean level to 3500 years ago. 4 \"Paleomagnetism,\" Science News, July 1949. 5 P.

Consequently, he concludes, there were \"very heavy showers of meteors.\" \"The principal dif- ficulty of this explanation is that it requires a rate of accretion of meteoric dust several hundred times greater than that which astronomers . . . are presently prepared to admit.\" 6 Professor Ewing of Columbia University carried on his investigation in the Atlantic. In 1949 he published his results, and, like Pettersson, he found that lava spread only recently on the bottom of the ocean. He also came upon signs of land deep on the bottom of the ocean and concluded: \"Either the land must have sunk two to three miles, or the sea once must have been two or three miles lower than now. Either conclusion is startling.\" The pollen analysis, made by various scientists, of the bottom of the North Sea, between Germany, England, Scotland, and Norway, convinced researchers that this sea in its present shape originated only very recently in the Subboreal, the date of 1500 before the present era often being selected. At that time there oc- curred a Klimavturz.

The origin of asteroids, or small planets, that circle between Jupiter and Mars, some of which cross the orbit of Mars and even that of the earth, has lately been ex- plained as the result of the explosion of a planet and more recently (1950) as the result of a collision between two planets in an early age (Kuiper). N. T. Bobrovnikoflf of the Perkins Observatory offered anew his own explana- tion of the origin of the asteroids: they are \"remnants of a gigantic prehistoric comet.\" F. Whipple, upon calculat- ing the orbits of the asteroids, came to the conclusion (1950) that two collisions occurred between these bodies and a comet, once 4700 years ago and the second time 1500 years ago, or within historical times. These dates of collision in the solar system are of the same order as those offered in W or Ids in Collision, deduced there from historical evidence and testimony. C. Tombaugh, the discoverer of Pluto, explained (1950) the dark areas and the canals of Mars as resulting from collisions of Mars with asteroids. According to ^Worlds in Collision, Mars was involved in repeated collisions with large cometary masses. Actually, in January 1950, an explosion observed on Mars was interpreted (by Opik) as a collision with an asteroid; clouds of dust of continental dimensions rose and screened surface features of the planet. O. Struve of Yerkes Observatory, reviewing the achieve- ments of astronomy during 1950, wrote that \"by a bizarre coincidence\" in that year \"a deluge of sound papers\" on \"collisions within the solar system\" followed on the heels of Worlds in Collision. There are two theories concerning the origin of lunar craters. Their size is enormous nothing comparable is known on earth. According to one theory, these craters are the result of a collision of the moon with very large meteorites, of the size of asteroids; according to the other theory, they are volcanic formations. Both theories assume very violent events in which the celestial body"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"FORUM ADDRESS 261 closest to the earth was involved. In Worlds in Collision I offered the following explanation of the lunar craters, as well as of the seas of lava and the rifts on the lunar surface: During the great catastrophes, when the moon together with the terrestrial globe passed through the fabric of a great comet and again when, in the eighth century before the present era, the earth and the moon were strongly perturbed by Mars, \"the moon's surface flowed with lava and bubbled into great circular forma- tions, which rapidly cooled off in the long lunar night, unprotected by an atmosphere from the coolness of cosmic spaces. In these cosmic collisions and near con- tacts the surface of the moon was also marked by clefts and rifts.\" If the circular formations on the moon are these bub- bles which collapsed, then probably there are smaller bubbles on the moon that have not yet burst. Dr. H. Percy Wilkins, the English selenographer, actually found over forty unexploded bubbles or domes on the moon, several of which lie to the northeast of Copernicus crater; the largest of these is found within Darwin crater and is twenty miles hi diameter, according to an article by F. Benario in Vega (1953). I have expressed my opinion that many comets are of recent origin, and I have supported this view by refer- ence to the frequency and luminosity of comets in the days of imperial Rome in comparison to the number of comets visible to the unaided eye in the last centuries. This notion received vigorous confirmation in the extensive work on comets done in Soviet Russia by a leading authority on the subject, Professor S. K. Vsehsviat- sky. His research reveals that periodic comets, as ob- served during recent decades, are losing their luminosity and their matter at a rate so rapid that fifty or sixty revolutions suffice to disintegrate a comet completely. Thus the Halley comet can hardly go back beyond 3500 years, or the year 1500 before the present era. In the last century several comets with short periods have failed to return, having apparently lost all their matter, and a few others actually fell apart before the eyes of observers. The rapid decay of comets excludes the possibility that they have belonged to our solar system from the beginning, or from the time the planets were formed. The theory that sees in comets bodies that arrived from"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"262 SUPPLEMENT other solar systems has been generally abandoned. Vphsviatsky also shows whv we must reject a theory of the capture of comets from a c^ud of dust and gases through which our solar system presumably passed some- time in the past.

This is a revival o f the theorv of R. Proctor, who seventy years a?o ascribed the origin of the so-called Jovian familv of comets c^nnrHnc the ma?or- ity of comets of short periods to eruptions from Jupiter. The gases of Jupiter and Saturn are in violent motion despite their low temperatures: yet the velocity necessary for escape from the major planets is so great (60 kilo- meters per second from Jupiter) that Vsehsviatsky admits not knowing the mechanism that could in conditions presently prevailing on maior planets impart this velocity to the exploded matter. Nevertheless, Vsehsviatsky in- sists that in the recent past conditions on these planets must have been such that this was possible, even if these conditions cannot be defined. He emphasi?es that, by casting off the exploded matter, planets must have channed their own masses and conse- quently their orbits. They must also have experienced recoils. In the Publications of the Kiew Observatory for 1953, Vsehsviatsky says : \"The history of the planetary system was characterized, we assume, by definitely more rapid changes and more active physical processes than appeared when only gravitational interrelations in the solar system were taken into account.\" * All this is in complete harmony with the conclusions at which I arrived in Worlds in Collision concerning the time (a few thousand years ago) of the birth of comets of short periods and their origin (by eruption from the planets, especially the major planets). There I also ex- plained the forces or conditions that caused the major 1 S. K.

Now my claim, based on historical material, that the composition of the solar system was changed in historical times, is given the support of observation and calculation. The electromagnetic nature of the universe, deduced hi Worlds in Collision from a series of historical pheno- mena, is supported by another series of recent observa- tions. At Evans Signal Laboratory of the United States Army Signal Corps, in Belmar, New Jersey, researchers con- ducting pioneer experiments on the reception of radar echoes from the moon detected noises coming from the sun. These noises point to discharges of strong potentials. In the fall of 1947, at the meeting of the British As- sociation for the Advancement of Science, Sir Edward Appleton reported that radio noises coming from the sun coincide with solar flares. According to him, \"a sunspot is the most powerful ultra-short-wave radio-station known, its power being much greater than a million kilowatts.\" In 1948 and 1949 Donald Menzel produced motion pictures of prominences or explosions of matter on the sun; they were made at the Solar Observatory in Climax, Colorado. The exploded matter rose at a very great speed to immense heights, all the time gaining in velocity, and then descended to the sun, not on a curved path as a mis- sile would do, but by retreating on the path it had cov- ered, comparable to a missile reversing its direction and returning to its point of departure. Moreover, the velocity of its descent was without the acceleration expected in a fall, and this too was in violation of gravitational me- chanics. It has been observed that when protuberances or surges of exploded matter on the sun run into one another, both of them recoil violently; such observation was made by McMath and Sawyer, and on another occasion by Lyot. The conclusion drawn by E. Pettit of Mount Wil- son Observatory (1951) is that solar protuberances are electrically charged. Above the protuberances \"the coronal structure is often bent into the form of an arch, sometimes into"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"264 SUPPLEMENT several concentric arches. This is additional evidence of the electrical nature of the prominences [protuberances] and corona.\" 2 In the configuration of the cometary nuclei and tails there was found \"good evidence that all particles in the comet influence the motion of each other,\" and the con- figuration of the streamers in the tails of many comets \"strongly indicate a mutual repulsion.\" Thus wrote Pro- fessor N. T. Bobrovnikoff, director of the Perkins Ob- servatory (195 1). 3 It was also calculated that the re- pulsion of the tails of the comets by the sun is twenty thousand times stronger than the gravitational attraction, and the implication is that it cannot be caused by the pressure of light, as previously thought, and that elec- trical repulsion must be in action. From spectral analysis it is known that the cometary tails do not shine merely by reflected light, and that their light is not caused by combustion either, but most probably is an electrical effect, comparable to the effect of a Geissler tube. 4 In order to explain the general magnetic field of the terrestrial globe, Dr. E. C. Bullard, of Great Britain's National Physical Laboratory, assumed (1953) elec- trical currents in the liquid metal core of the earth. The polar lights have been explained by various scien- tists as electrical charges arriving from the sun. Follow- ing disturbances on the sun there is an immediate disturbance in the ionosphere and radio-transmission, ground currents, and the magnetic field of the earth; there is also a second retarded but pronounced reaction about twenty-five hours later, and auroral displays. In 1948 Enrico Fermi explained the enigmatically high charges of the cosmic rays as a result of the positive par- ticles having traveled through magnetic fields in space. In 1951 Richtmyer and Teller, following an earlier idea of Swann, explained these charges as originating in the sun: protons and heavy nuclei could be accelerated to the enormous velocity of cosmic-ray particles by an extended magnetic field of solar origin. Both theories assume the existence of magnetic fields in space. I could add to this that if the earth is a negatively charged body the great 2 E.

At Mount Wilson Observatory Harold Babcock de- termined (1947) that some of the fixed stars possess gen- eral magnetic fields of great intensity. (One of the stars was found to reverse its polarity every nine days from plus 7000 gauss to minus 6300 gauss. This may be under- stood as a sign that the star is rotating, turning another pole to us every nine days. The star shows no Zeeman effect in between, that is, when the observer is in the plane of the equatorial belt of the star, in the same posi- tion in which we are permanently in relation to our sun. 5 ) By 1952 the Royal Astronomer, Sir Harold Spencer Jones, estimated that magnetic properties were established in more than one hundred stars, and the number of identified magnetic stars is rapidly growing. Several years ago Dr. J. S. Hall, of the United States Naval Observatory, and Dr. W. Hiltner, of Yerkes Ob- servatory, found that the light from certain stars is strongly polarized. It was surmised that starlight must pass through particles of magnetized interstellar dust. The question raised was why the particles of dust should all be oriented in the same direction as their magnetic axes. However, if these clouds of dust are electrically charged and in motion, the common magnetic orientation of these particles is only natural. In June 1950 W. Baade of Palomar and L. Spitzer of Princeton offered a theory of colliding galaxies. By No- vember of 1952 it was definitely spoken of as \"a titanic collision of two giant star clusters\" behind the constella- tion Cygnus (Swan) of the Milky Way. The fact of the \"big crash\" was substantiated by strong evidence the radio noises coming from beyond the Milky Way and sifting through it. Galaxies, each as large as the Milky Way, with numberless stars, were riding one through another, colliding and sending out a terrible S.O.S. through the universe in the form of anguished 6 The divergent results obtained in the determination of the solar magnetic field may be due to the varying position of the earth in relation to the solar magnetic equator, which does not coincide with the solar equator or with the ecliptic.

These signals were interpreted by Baade and K. Minkowski as the reverberations of crashes on a galac- tic scale. After millions of years of traveling with the velocity of light, these signals reached our radio-telescopes as clearly audible noises. They left the place of the catas- trophe so long ago, yet, because of the magnitude of galaxies, the collision is possibly still going on. The sig- nals that are emitted today will reach our solar system when our sun may have already turned into a dwarf star and our planet into clouds of dust. Not only the fact of the collision of galaxies startled the astronomers, but even more the medium through which it became known: the colliding galaxies send electromag- netic signals, thus evidencing the electromagnetic structure of galaxies and of the very space of the universe. By August 1953 the statement was made that another celestial host of stars was charging on a rival galaxy in the direction of the sky where we see the Crab nebula and that still another collision was going on behind the constellation Cassiopeia. In the March 1951 issue of RCA Review, John H. Nel- son of the engineering department of RCA Communica- tions, Inc., announced the results of several years of careful observations on the dependence of regular radio transmission on the position of planets in the solar system. He drew graphs and wrote: \"It can be readily seen from these graphs that disturbed conditions show good correla- tion with planetary configurations. ... It is definitely shown that each of the six planets studied is effective in some configurations.\" The press reported: \"Evidence of a strange and unex- plained correlation between the positions of Jupiter, Saturn and Mars in their orbits around the sun and the presence of violent electrical disturbances in the earth's upper atmosphere . . . seems to indicate [thatl the planets and the sun share in a cosmic electrical-balance mechan- ism that extends a billion miles from the center of our solar system. Such an electrical balance is not accounted for in current astrophysical theories.\" 6 Short-wave frequencies are disturbed when Jupiter, Saturn, and Mars line up either in a straight line or at right angles to one another.

In this connection, the older theory of a dirett but unexplained relation between the revolution of Jupiter and the sunspot cycle is seen in a new light. Also, the observation of Stetson, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, that the moon affects radio reception it is twice as good when the moon is under the horizon as when it is overhead belongs in the same category as Nelson's observation of planetary influences on the iono- sphere. Stetson thought this effect was caused by some radiation emanating from the moon, for a neutral moon could not produce the phenomenon. By 1953 the strange fact was established that the solar tides in the earth's atmosphere are sixteen times more powerful than the lunar tides in the atmosphere, a fact in complete conflict with the tidal theory, according to which the action of the moon on oceanic tides is several times more powerful than that of the sun. The fifty-fold discrepancy is still without an acceptable explanation. These are only a few of the recent discoveries that make a revision of the mechanistic concept of the uni- verse quite mandatory. Exactly because of the accuracy achieved without reck- oning with forces that appear to exist, celestial mechanics, a solid work of great mathematical minds for almost three centuries, may seem even more in need of such revision. All this has little direct bearing on the story of Worlds in Collision, which claims only the eft'ect to be expected if a magnetic body like the earth should come very close to another magnetic body. It was my skepticism concern- ing the infallibility of the celestial mechanics, which as- sumes the celestial bodies to be electrically and magnet- ically sterile, that was the real cause of the emotional outburst. Let us think of a binary or double star; both stars revolve around each other or a common center. A half- revolution period of a few days or only hours is com- mon. Let us assume that the stars of the binary are magnets 7000 gauss strong.

But this is enough to render the purely mechanical celestial system fallible hi respect also to single stars and equally so to the sun and its planets. In Jupiter and its moons we have a system not unlike the solar family. The planet is cold, yet its gases are in motion. It appears probable to me that it sends out radio noises as do the sun and the stars. I suggest that this be investigated. 7 Uranus is the only planet about which we know that, for a considerable part of its revolution, it turns one of its poles toward us. If the gases on Uranus are not in turbulent motion, but have a smooth reflecting surface, I would expect the solar light reflected from the polar re- gions of Uranus to be polarized: as is well known, light reflected from the poles of a magnet is polarized. [It is generally thought that the magnetic field of the earth does not sensitively reach the moon. But there is a way to find out whether it does or not. The moon makes daily rocking movements librations of latitude, some of which are explained by no theory. I suggest investigating whether these unaccounted librations are synchronized with the daily revolutions of the magnetic poles of the earth around its geographical poles.] C.

Our sun and its planets are not outside a galaxy; they are not unique or an exception in the plan of the universe. I like to tell this story. Once, in the twilight hour, a visitor came to my study, a distinguished-looking gentle- man. He brought me a manuscript dealing with celestial mechanics. After a glance at some of the pages, I had the feeling that this was the work of a mathematical genius. I entered into conversation with my visitor and mentioned the name of James Clerk Maxwell. My guest asked: \"Who is he?\" Embarrassed, I answered: \"You know, the scientist who gave a theoretical explanation of the experiments of Faraday.\" \"And who is Faraday?\" inquired the stranger. In growing embarrassment 1 said: \"Of course, the man who did the pioneer work in electromagnetism.\" \"And what is electromagnetism?\" asked the gentleman. \"What is your name?\" I inquired. He answered: \"Isaac Newton.\" I awoke. On my knees was an open volume: Newton's Principia. This story is told to illustrate what I have said before. Would you listen to anybody discuss the mechanics of the spheres who does not know the elementary physical forces existing in nature? But this is the position adopted by astronomers who acclaim as infallible a celestial me- chanics conceived in the 1660s in which electricity and magnetism play not the slightest role. In the fields of archaeology, geology, and astronomy the last few years have brought a vast array of facts to corroborate the claim made in Worlds in Collision that there were physical upheavals of a global character in historical times; that these catastrophes were caused by extraterrestrial agents; and that the nature of these agents may be identified. Although I arrived at results in con- flict with orthodox beliefs, yet recent years have dis- closed new observations and findings, all in support and none in refutation. What I want to impress upon you is that science today, as in the days of Newton, lies before us as a great un-"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"270 SUPPLEMENT charted ocean, and we have not yet sailed very far from the coast of ignorance. In the study of the human soul we have learned only a few mechanisms of behavior as di- rected from the subconscious mind, but we do not know what thinking is or what memory is. And in biology we do not know what life is. The age of basic discoveries is not yet at its end, and you are not latecomers, for whom no fundamentals are left to discover. As I see so many of you today, I visualize some of you, ten or twenty or thirty years from now, as fortunate discoverers, those of you who possess inquisitive and challenging minds, the will to persist, and an urge to store knowledge. Don't be afraid to face facts, and never lose your ability to ask the questions: Why? and How? Be in this like a child. Don't be afraid of ridicule; think of the history of all great discoveries. I quote Alfred North Whitehead: \"If you have had your attention directed to the novel- ties of thought in your own lifetime, you will have ob- served that almost all really new ideas have a certain aspect of foolishness when they are first produced.\" 8 Therefore, dare. And should even the great ones of your age try to dis- courage you, think of the greatest scientist of antiquity, Archimedes, who jeered at the theory of Aristarchus, twenty-five years his senior, that the earth revolves around the sun. Untruth in science may live for cen- turies, and you may not see yourself vindicated, but dare. Don't persist in your idea if the facts are against it; but do persist if you see facts gathering on your side. It may be that even the strongest opposition, that of figures, will crumble before the facts. The greatest mathematician who ever walked on these shores, Simon Newcomb, proved in 1903 that a flying machine carrying a pilot is a mathematical impossibility. In the same year of 1903 the , Wright brothers, without mathematics, but by a fact, proved him wrong. In religion, the great revelations and the great authori- ties the founding fathers belong to the past, and the older the authority, the greater it is. In science, unlike religion, the great revelations lie in the future; the com- 8 Alfred North Whitehead, Science and the Modern World (New York, 1925), Chapter HI."},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"FORUM ADDRESS 271 ing generations are the authorities; and the pupil is greater than the master, if he has the gift to see things anew. All fruitful ideas have been conceived in the minds of the nonconformists, for whom the known was still un- known, and who often went back to begin where others passed by, sure of their way. The truth of today was the heresy of yesterday. Imagination coupled with skepticism and an ability to wonder if you possess these, bountiful nature will hand you some of the secrets out of her inexhaustible store. The pleasure you will experience in discovering truth will re- pay you for your work; don't expect other compensation, because it may not come.
