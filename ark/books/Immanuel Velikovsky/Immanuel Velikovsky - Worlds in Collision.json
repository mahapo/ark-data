In these wars the planet earth participated too. Th is book describes two acts of a great drama: one that occurred thirty-four to thirty-five centuries ago, in th e middle of the second millennium before the present era; the other in the eighth an d the beginning of the seventh century before the present era, twenty-six centuries ago. Accordingl y, this volume consists of two parts, preceded by a prologue. Harmony or stability in the celestial and terrestr ial spheres is the point of departure of the present-day concept of the world as expressed in the celestial mechanics of Newton and the theory of evolution of Darwin. If these two men of science are sacrosanct, this book is a heresy. However, modern physics, of atoms and of the quantum theory, describes dramatic changes in the microcosm— the atom—the prototype of the so lar system; a theory, th en, that envisages not dissimilar events in the macrocosm—the solar sy stem-brings the modern concepts of physics to the celestial sphere. This book is written for the instructed and uni nstructed alike. No formula and no hieroglyphic will stand in the way of those who set out to read it. If, occasionally, historical evidence does not square with formulated laws, it should be re membered that a law is but a deduction from experience and experiment, and therefore laws must conform with historical facts, not facts with laws. The reader is not asked to accept a theory without question. Rather, he is invited to consider for himself whether he is reading a book of fiction or non-fiction, wh ether what he is reading is invention or historical fact. On one point alone, not necessarily decisive for the theory of cosmic catastrophism, I borrow credence: I use a synchr onical scale of Egyptian and Hebrew histories which is not orthodox. It was in the spring of 1940 that I came upon the id ea that in the days of the Exodus, as evident from many passages of the Scriptures, there occu rred a great physical catas trophe, and that such an event could serve in determining the time of the Exodus in Egyptian history or in establishing a synchronical scale for the histories of the peopl es concerned. Thus I started Ages in Chaos, a reconstruction of the history of the ancient world from the middle of the second millennium before the present era to the advent of Alexander the Great. Already in the fall of that same year, 1940, I felt that I had acquired an un derstanding of the real nature and extent of that catastrophe, and for nine years I worked on both projects, th e political and the natu ral histories. Although Ages in Chaos was finished first, in the order of publication it will follow this work. Worlds in Collision comprises only the last two acts of the cosmic drama. A few earlier acts— one of them known as the Deluge—will be the s ubject of another volume of natural history. The historical-cosmological story of this book is based on the ev idence of historical texts of many peoples around the globe, on classical literature, on epics of northern races, on sacred books of the peoples of the Orient and Occident , on traditions and folklore of primitive peoples, on old astronomical inscriptions and charts, on archaeological finds, and also on geological and paleontological material. If cosmic upheavals occurred in the historic al past, why does not the human race remember them, and why was it necessary to carry on res earch to find out about them? I discuss this problem in the Section \"The Collective Amnesia. \" The task I had to accomplish was not unlike that faced by a psychoanalyst who, out of disa ssociated memories and dreams, reconstructs a forgotten traumatic experience in the early life of an individual. In an analytical experiment on mankind, historical inscriptions a nd legendary motifs often play th e same role as recollections (infantile memories) and dreams in the analysis of a personality. Can we, out of this polymorphous material, establish actual fact s? We shall check one people against another, one inscription against another, epics against charts, geology against legends, until we are able to extract the historical facts. In a f ew cases it is impossible to say with certainty whether a record or a tradition refers to one or another catastrophe that took place through the ages; it is also probable that in some traditions robin-bobin"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"various elements from different ages are fused t ogether. In the final anal ysis, however, it is not so essential to segregate definitively the records of single world catastrophes. More important, it seems, is to establish (1) that there were physi cal upheavals of a global ch aracter in historical times; (2) that these catastrophes were caused by extraterrestrial ag ents; and (3) that these agents can be identified. There are many implications that follow from thes e conclusions. I refer to them in the Epilogue, so that I can omit reference to them here. A few readers went over this book in manuscript a nd made valuable suggestions and remarks. In chronological order of th eir reading they are: Dr. Horace M. Kallen, formerly Dean of the Gr aduate Faculty of the New School for Social Research, New York; John J. O'Neill, Science Ed itor of the New York Herald Tribune; James Putnam, Associate Editor of the Macmillan Comp any; Clifton Fadiman, literary critic and commentator; Gordon A. Atwater, Chairman and Curator of the Hayden Planetarium of the American Museum of Natural History, New York . The last two read th e work at their own request after Mr. O'Neill had discussed it in an article in the Herald Tribune of August 11,1946. I am indebted to all of them but I alone am responsible for content and form. Miss Marion Kuhn cleared the manuscript of gr ammatical weeds and helped in reading the proofs. Many an author has dedicated his book to his wife or mentioned her in the preface. I have always felt this was somewhat ostentatious, but now that this work is being published, I feel I shall be most ungrateful if I fail to menti on that my wife Elisheva spent al most as much time on it at our desk as I did. I dedicate this book to her. The years when Ages in Chaos and Worlds in Collision were written were years of a world catastrophe created by man—of war th at was fought on land, on sea, and in the air. During that time man learned how to take apart a few of the br icks of which the universe is built—the atoms of uranium. If one day he should solve the pr oblem of the fission and fusion of the atoms of which the crust of the earth or its water and ai r are composed, he may perchance, by initiating a chain reaction, take this planet out of the struggle for surv ival among the members of the celestial sphere.

Living creatures fill the liquid; other living creatures fly in the gas; and still others cr eep and walk upon the ground on the bottom of the gaseous ocean. Man, a being of erect stature, thin ks himself the prince of creation. He felt like this long before he, by his own efforts, came to know how to fly on wings of metal around the globe.

He assumes that gravitation keeps the plan etary system together, man and beast on their planet, the sea within its borders. For millions and millions of years, he maintains, the planets have rolled along on the same paths, and their moons around them, and man in these eons has arisen from a one-cell in fusorium all the long way up the ladder to his status of Homo sapiens.

The Celestial Harmony The sun rises in the east and sets in the west. The day consists of twenty-four hours. The year consists of 365 days, 5 hours, and 49 minutes . The moon circles around the earth, changing its phases-crescent, full, decrescent. The terrestrial axis points in the direct ion of the polar star. After winter comes spring, then summer and fall. These are common facts. Are they invariable laws? Must it be so forever? Was it so always? The sun has nine planets. Merc ury has no satellites; Venus has no satellites; the earth has a moon; Mars has two small trabants, mere pieces of rock, and one of them completes its month before Mars ends its day; Jupiter has eleven moons and eleven different kinds of months to count; Saturn has nine moons, Uranus has five moons,1 Neptune one, Pluto none.2 Was it always so? Will it be so forever? The sun rotates in an easterly dir ection. All planets revolv e in their orbits in the same direction (counterclockwise if seen from the north) ar ound the sun. Most of their moons revolve counterclockwise (in direct motion) , but there are a few that revol ve in the opposite direction (in retrograde motion). No orbit is an exact circle; there is no regularity in the eccentrical shapes of the planetary orbits; each elliptical curve verges in a different direction. It is not known for certain, but it is assumed that Mercury permanently shows the same face to the sun, as our moon does with respect 1 The fifth satellite of Ur anus was discovered in 1948. 2 Due to the great distance of Neptune and Pluto from the earth, smaller satellites around these planets may have remained undiscovered.

Information obtained by different met hods of observation of Ve nus is contradictory; it is not known whether Venus rotates so slowly that its day equals its year, or so rapidly that the night side is never sufficiently cooled. Mars rotates in 24 hours, 37 minutes, 22.6 seconds (mean period), a period comparable to th e terrestrial day. Jupiter, which in volume is thirteen hundred times larger than the earth, co mpletes a rotation in the short space of 9 hours and 50 minutes. What causes this variability? It is not a law that a planet must rotate or have days and nights; still less that its day and night must return every twenty-four hours. If Pluto rotates from east to west,3 it has the s un rising in the west. Uran us has the sun rising and setting neither in the east nor in the west. So it is not a law that a planet of the solar system must rotate from west to east and that the sun must rise in the east. The equator of the earth is inclined to the plane of its ecliptic at an angle of 23M°; this causes the change of seasons during the annual revolution around the sun. The axes of other planets point in the directions of seemingly delibe rate choice. It is not a general law for all planets that winter must follow fall and summer the spring. The axis of Uranus is placed almost in the plan e of its orbit; for about twenty years one of its polar regions is the hottest place on the planet. Then night gradually descends and twenty years later the other pole enters the tropi cs for an equal length of time.4 The moon has no atmosphere. It is not known wh ether Mercury has any atmosphere. Venus is covered with dense clouds, but not of water va por. Mars has a transp arent atmosphere, but almost without oxygen or water vapor, and its composition is unknown. Jupiter and Saturn have gaseous envelopes; it is not known whether they have solid cores. It is not a general law that a planet must have atmosphere or water. Mars is 0.15 of the volume of the earth; the next planet, Jupiter, is about 8,750 times as large as Mars.

The celestial harmony is composed of bodies differen t in size, different in form, different in the velocity of rotation, with differently directed axes of rotation, with di fferent directions of rotation, with differently composed atmospheres or without atmospheres, with a varying number of moons or without moons, and with sa tellites revolving in either direction. It appears then to be by chance that the earth has a moon, that we have day and night and that their combined length is equal to twenty-four hours, that we have a sequence of seasons, that we have oceans and water, atmosphere and oxygen, a nd probably also that our planet is placed between Venus at our left and Mars at our right. The Origin of the Planetary System All theories of the origin of the planetary system and the motive forces that sustain the motion of its members go back to the gravitational theory and the celestial mechanics of Newton. The sun attracts the planets, and if it were not for a second force, they would fall into the sun; but each planet is impelled by a motive force to proceed in a direction away from the sun, and as a result, an orbit is formed. Similarly, a satellite or a moon is subject to a force that drives it away from its primary, but the attraction of the primary bends the path on which the satellite would have proceeded if there had been no at traction between the bodies, and out of these forces a satellite orbit is traced. The inertia or persistence of motion implanted in planets and satellites was postulated by Newton, but he did not explain ho w or when the initial pull or push occurred.1 The theory of the origin of th e planetary system which dominated the entire nineteenth century was proposed by Swedenborg, the theologian, an d Kant, the philosopher. It was put into scientific terms by Laplace,2 alt hough not explored by him quantitatively, and in brief is as follows: 1 Isaac Newton, Principia (Mathematical Principles) (1686), Bk. III. 2 P. S. Laplace, Exposition du susteme du monde (1796). 8  WORLDS IN COLLISION Hundreds of millions of years ago the sun wa s nebulous and very large and had a form approaching that of a disc. This di sc was as wide as the whole orbit of the farthest of the planets. It rotated around its center. Owi ng to the process of compressi on caused by gravitation, a globular sun shaped itself in the center of the disc. Because of the rotating motion of the whole nebula, a centrifugal force was in action; parts of matter more on the periphery resisted the retracting action directed toward the center and broke up into rings which balled into globes— these were the planets in the process of shaping. In other words, as a result of the shrinkage of the rotating sun, matter broke away and portions of this solar mate rial developed into planets. The plane in which the planets revolve is the equatorial plane of the sun. This theory is now regarded as unsatisfactory. Th ree objections stand out a bove others. First, the velocity of the axial rotation of the sun at the time the planetary system was built could not have been sufficient to enable bands of matter to break away ; but even if they had broken away, they would not have balled into globes. Second, the Laplace theory does not explain why the planets have larger angular velocity of daily rotation and yearly revolution than the sun could have imparted to them. Third, what made some of the sa tellites revolve retrogra dely, or in a direction opposite to that of most of th e members of the solar system? \"It appears to be clearly established that, wh atever structure we assign to a primitive sun, a planetary system cannot come into being merely as the result of the sun's rotation. If a sun, rotating alone in space, is not ab le of itself to produce its fami ly of planets and satellites, it becomes necessary to invoke the presence and assi stance of som e second body. This brings us at once to the tidal theory.\" 8 robin-bobin"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The tidal theory, which, in its earlier stage, wa s called the plane-tesimal theory,4 assumes that a star passed close to the sun. An immense tide of matter arose from the sun in the direction of the passing star and was torn from the body of the sun but remained in its 3 Sir James H. Jeans, Astronomy and Cosmogony (1929), p. 409. 4 The planetesimal hypothesis was developed by T. C. Chamberlin and F. R. Moulton. WORLDS 72V COLLISION  9 domain, being the material out of which the plan ets were built. In the planetesimal theory the mass that was torn out broke into small parts whic h solidified in space; some were driven out of the solar system, and some fell back into the sun, but the rest moved around it because of its gravitational pull. Sweeping in elongated orbits around the sun, they conglomerated, rounded out their orbits as a result of mutual collisions, a nd grew to form planets and satellites around the planets. The tidal theory 5 does not allow the matter torn fr om the sun to disperse first and reunite later; the tide broke into a few portions that rather quickly changed from gaseous to fluid, and then to the solid state. In support of this theory it was indicated that such a tid e, when broken into a number of \"drops,\" would probabl y build the largest \"drops\" out of its middle portion, and small \"drops\" from its beginning (near the sun) and its end (most remote from the sun). Actually, Mercury, nearest to the sun, is a sm all planet. Venus is larger; earth is a little larger than Venus; Jupiter is three hundred and twenty times as larg e as the earth (in mass); Saturn is somewhat smaller than Jupiter; Uranus and Neptune, though large planets, are not as large as Jupiter and Saturn. Pluto is quite as small as Mercury. The first difficulty of the tidal hypothesis lies in the very point adduced in its support, the mass of the planets. Between the earth and Jupiter ther e revolves a small planet, Mars, a tenth part of the earth in mass, where, according to the scheme, a planet ten to fifty times as large as the earth should be expected. Again, Neptune is larger and not smaller than Uranus. Another difficulty is the allegedl y rare chance of an encounter between two stars. One of the authors of the tidal theory gave this estimate of its probability: 6 \"At a rough estimate we may suppose that a given st ar's chance of forming a planetary system is one in 5,000,000,000,000,000,000 years.\" But sin ce the life span of a star is much shorter than this figure, \"only about one star in 100,000 can ha ve formed a planetary system in the whole of its life.\" In the galactic syst em of one hundred million stars, s The tidal theory was developed by J. H. J eans and H. Jeffreys. 6 Jeans, Astronomy and Cosmogony, p. 409. 10  WORLDS IN COLLISION planetary systems \"form at the rate of about one per five billion years. . . . our own system, with an age of the order of two billion years, is probably the youngest system in the whole galactic system of stars.\" The nebular and tidal theories alike regard the pl anets as derivatives of the sun, and the satellites as derivatives of the planets. The problem of the origin of the moon can be re garded as disturbing to the tidal theory. Being smaller than the earth, the moon completed earlier the pr ocess of cooling and shrinking, and the lunar volcanoes had already ceased to be active. It is calculated that th e moon possesses a lighter specific weight than the earth. It is assumed that the moon was produced from the superficial layers of the earth's body, which ar e rich in light silicon, whereas the core of the earth, the main portion of its body, is made of heavy metals, partic ularly iron. But this assumption postulates the origin of the moon as not simultaneous with the origin of the earth; the earth, being formed out of a mass ejected from the sun, had to undergo a process of leveling, wh ich placed the heavy metals in the core and silicon at the peripher y, before the moon parted from the earth by a new tidal distortion. This would mean two consecutive tidal distortions in a system where the chance of even one is held extremely rare. If the pa ssing of one star near another happens among one hundred million stars once in five billion years, tw o occurrences like this for one and the same star seem quite incredible.

The circling of the sate llites around the planets also confr onts existing cosmological theories with difficulties. Laplace built his theory of the origin of the solar system on the assumption that all planets and satellites revolve in the same direction. He wrot e that the axial rotation of the sun and the orbital revolutions and axial rotations of the six planets, the moon, the satellites, and the rings of Saturn present forty- three movements, all in the sa me direction. \"One finds by the analysis of the probabilities that there are more than four thous and billion chances to one that this arrangement is not the result of chance; this probability is considerably higher than that of the reality WORLDS IN COLLISION  11 of historical events with rega rd to which no one would ventur e a doubt.\" 7 He deduced that a common and primal cause directed the m ovements of the planets and satellites. Since the time of Laplace, new members of the solar system have been discovered. Now we know that though the majority of the satellites revolve in the sa me direction as the planets revolve and the sun rotates, the moons of Uranus revolve in a plane almost perpendicular to the orbital plane of their planet, and three of the eleven moons of Jup iter, one of the nine moons of Saturn, and the one moon of Neptune revolve retrogradely. These facts contradict the main argument of the Laplace theory: a rotating nebula could not produ ce satellites revolving in two directions. In the tidal theory the direction of the planets' movements depended on the star that passed: it passed in the plane in which the planets now revo lve and in a direction which determined their circling from west to east. But why should the sa tellites of Uranus revolve perpendicularly to that plane and some moons of Jupiter and Saturn in reverse directions? This the tidal theory fails to explain. According to all existing theories, the angular ve locity of the revolution of a satellite must be slower than the velocity of rotation of its parent. But the inner satellite of Mars revolves more rapidly than Mars rotates. Some of the difficulties that confront the nebular and tidal theories also confront another theory that has been proposed in recent years.8 Accordi ng to it, the sun is supposed to have been a member of a double star system. A passing star cr ushed the companion of the sun, and out of its debris planets were formed. In further developmen t of this hypothesis, it is maintained that the larger planets were built out of the debris, and the smaller ones, th e so-called \"terrestrial\" planets, were formed from the larger ones by a process of cleavage. The birth of smaller, solid plan ets out of the larger, gaseous on es is conjectured in order to explain the difference in the relation of 7 Laplace.

By a process of cleavage, the moon was born of the earth; but since the specific weight of the moon is greater than that of the larger planets and smaller than that of the earth, it woul d seem to be more in accord with the theory that the earth was born of the moon, despite its smallness. This confuses the argument. The origin of the planets and their satellites re mains unsolved. The theories not only contradict one another, but each of them bears within itsel f its own contradictions. \"If the sun had been unattended by planets, its origin and evolution would have presented no difficulty.\" • The Origin of the Comets The nebular and tidal theories endeavor to expl ain the origin of the solar system but do not include the comets in their schemes.

They are seen presently at an approximate rate of five hundred in a century, and are said to have an average period of tens of thousands of years. A few theories of the origin of comets have been proposed, but aside from one attempt to see in them planetesimals that did not receive a side pull sufficiently strong to bring them into circular orbits,1 no scheme has been develope d that explains the origin of the solar system in its entirety, with its planets and comets; yet no cosmic theory can persist which limits itself to the problem of either planets or comets exclusively. 9 Jeans, Astronomy and Cosmogony, p. 395. 1 An attempt to explain the comets, in the frame of the planetesimal theory, as scattered debris of a great wreck, was made by T. C. Cham berlin, The Two Solar Families (1928). WORLDS IN COLLISION 13 One theory sees in the comets errant cosmic bodies arriving from interstellar space. After approaching the sun, they turn away on an open (parabolic) curve. But if they happen to pass close to one of the larger planet s, they may be compelled to change their open curves to ellipses and become comets of short period.2 This is the th eory of capture: comets of long periods or of no period are dislodged from their paths to become short-period comets. What the origin of the long-period comets is remains an unanswered question. The short-period comets apparently have some rela tion to the larger planet s. About fifty comets move between the sun and the orb it of Jupiter; their periods are under nine years. Four comets reach the orbit of Saturn; two co mets revolve inside the circle described by Uranus; and nine comets, with an average period of seventy-one years, move within the orbit of Neptune. These comprise the system of the short-period comets as it is known at present. To the last group belongs the Halley comet, which, among the comets of short periods, has the longest period of revolution—about seventy-six years. Then there is a great gap, af ter which there are comets that require thousands of years before they retu rn to the sun, if th ey return at all. The distribution of the s hort-period comets suggested the idea that they were \"captured\" by the large planets. This theory has for its support th e direct observation that comets are disturbed on their path by the planets. Another theory of the comets supposes their orig in to have been in the sun, but in a manner unlike that conceived of in the tidal theory of the origin of plan ets. Mighty whirls on the surface of the sun sweep ignited gases into great prot uberances; these are obs erved daily. Matter is driven off from the sun and returns to the sun. It is calculated 2 That planets are able to change the path of a comet is not only known from observation but has even been calculated in advance. In 1758 Clairaut predicted the retardati on of Halley's comet, on its first return foretold by Halley, for a period of 618 days, because it had to pass near Jupiter and Saturn. It was retarded for almost the computed length of time. Similarl y, the orbits of other comets were occasionally distorted. LexelTs come t was disturbed by Jupiter in 1767 and in 1770 by the earth, D'Arest's comet was disturbed in 1860, Wolf's comet in 1875 and 1922. By an encounter with Jupiter in 1886, Brook's comet cha nged its period from 29 years to 7 years; the period of Jupiter was not alte red by more than two or three minutes, and probably less. 14  WORLDS IN COLLISION that if the velocity of the ejection were to exceed 384 mile s per second, the speed of motion in a parabola, the matter would not return to the sun but would become a long-range comet. Then the path of the ejected mass might become perturbed as a result of its passage near one of the larger planets, and the comet would become one of a short period. Birth of a comet in this manner has never been observed, and the probability that m atter in explosion may reach a speed of 384 miles per sec ond is highly questionable. It was therefore robin-bobin"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"supposed alternatively that millions of years a go, when the activity of their gaseous masses was more dynamic, the large planets expelled comets from their bodi es. The speed required for the ejected mass to overcome the gravitational pull of the ejecting body is less in the case of the planets than in the case of the sun, owing to their smaller gravitational pull. It is calculated that a mass hurled from Jupiter at a speed of about 38 m iles per second, or at only a little more than a third of this velocity in the cas e of Neptune, would become expelled. This variant of the theory neglects the question of the origin of the long-period comets. However, an explanation was offered, according to which the large planets throw the comets that pass close to them from their short orbits into elongated on es, or even expel them entirely from the solar system. When passing close to the sun, comets emit tails. It is assumed that the ma terial of the tail does not return to the comet's head but is dispersed in space; consequently, the comets as luminous bodies must have a limited life. If Halley's comet has pursued its present orbit since late pre- Cambrian times, it must \"have grown and lost ei ght million tails, which seems improbable.\" 3 If comets are wasted, their number in the solar sy stem must permanently diminish, and no comet of short period could have preserved its tail since geological times. But as there are many luminous comets of shor t period, they must have been produced or acquired at some time when other members of the system, the planets and the satellites, were already in their places.

WORLDS IN COLLISION  15 Did the sun emit planets by shrinkage or by tide, and comets by explosion? Did the comets come from interstellar space and were they captured into the solar system by larger planets? Did the larger planets produce the smaller planets by cleava ge, or did they expel the short-period comets from their bodies? It is admitted that we cannot know the truth ab out the origin of the planetary and cometary systems billions of years ago. \"The problem of the origin and de velopment of the solar system suffers from the label 'speculative.' It is frequently said that as we were not there when the system was formed, we cannot legi timately arrive at any idea of how it was formed.\" * The most we can do, it is believed, is to investigate one planet, the one under our feet , in order to learn its past; and then, by the deductive method, to apply the results to other members of the solar system. 4 Harold Jeffreys, \"The Origin of the Solar Sy stem\" in Internal Constitution of the Earth, B. Gutenberg, ed. (1939). CHAPTER 2 The Planet Earth THE PLANET earth has a stony shell—the lithosphere; it consists of igneous rock, like granite and basalt, with sedimentary rock on top. The ig neous rock is the original crust of the earth; sedimentary rock is deposited by water. The inner composition of the earth is not known. The propaga tion of seismic waves gives support to the assumption that the shell of the earth is over 2,000 miles thick; on the basis of the gravitational effect of mountain ma sses (the theory of isostasy), th e shell is estimated to be only sixty miles thick. The presence of iron in the shell or the migration of heavy metals from the core to the shell has not been sufficiently explained. For these metals to have left the core, they must have been ejected by explosions, and in order to remain spr ead through the crust, the explosions must have been followed immediately by cooling. If, in the beginning, the planet wa s a hot conglomerate of elements, as the nebular as well as the tidal theories assume, then the iron of the gl obe should have become oxidized and combined with all available oxygen. But for some unknown reason this di d not take place; thus the presence of oxygen in the terres trial atmosphere is unexplained. robin-bobin"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"The water of the oceans contains a large amount of soluble sodium chloride, common salt.

Incased in sedimentary rock are skeletons of marine and land animals, often in many layers one upon the other. Not infrequently igneous rock is found protruding into sedimentar y rock or even covering it over large areas, pointing to successive eruptions of igneous rock that became heated and molten after there was life on the earth.

On the other hand, it is clear that igneous rock, already hard, had to beco me fluid in order to penetrate sedimentary rock or cover it. It is not known what initiated this pr ocess, but it is asserted that it must have happened long before man appeared on the earth. So when skulls of early man are found in late deposits, or skulls of modern man are found together with bones of extinct animals in early deposits, difficult problems are presented. Occasionally, also, during mining operations, a human skull is found in the middle of a mountai n, under a thick cover of basalt or granite, like the Calaveras skull of California. Human remains and human artifacts of bone, polis hed stone, or pottery are found under great deposits of till and gravel, sometimes under as much as a hundred feet. The origin of clay, sand, and gravel on igneous and sedimentary rock, offers a problem. The theory of Ice Ages was put forth (1840) to ex plain this and other enigmatic phenomena. As far north as Spitzbergen, in the polar circle, at some time in the past, coral reefs were formed, which do not occur except in tropical regions; palms also grew on Spitzbergen. The continent of Antarctica, which today has not a single tree on it, must have been covered at one time by forests, since it has coal deposits. As we see, the planet earth is full of secrets. We have not come closer to solving the problem of the origin of the solar system by investigating the planet under our feet; on the contrary, we have found many other unsolved problems concerning the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere of the earth. Shall we be more fortunate if we try to understand the pr ocess that caused the changes on the globe in the most recent geological epoch, the time of the last glacial period, a period close to the time which is regarded as historical? Ice Ages Not many thousands of years ago, we are taught, great areas of Europe and of North America were covered with glaciers. Perpetual WORLDS IN COLLISION  19 on the globe we are faced with it. Here is how the question is put concerning the eastern coast of North America. \"Not long ago in a geological sense, the flat plain from New Jersey to Florida was under the sea. At that time the ocean surf broke directly on the Old Appalachian Mountains. Previously the southeastern part of the mount ain structure had sunk below the sea and become covered with a layer of sand and mud, thickening seaward. The wedgelike mass of marine sediments was then uplifted and cut into by rivers, gi ving the Atlantic coastal plain of the United States. Why was it uplifted? To the westward are the Appalachians. The geologist tells us of the stressful times when a belt of rocks extending from Alabama to Newfoundland was jammed, thrust together, to make this mountain system. Why? How was it done ? In former times the sea flooded the region of the great plains from Me xico to Alaska, and then w ithdrew.

WORLDS IN COLLISION  21 ice lay not only on the slopes of high mountai ns, but loaded itself in heavy masses upon continents even in moderate latitudes. Where today the Hudson, the Elbe, and the upper Dnieper flow, there were then frozen deserts. They we re like the immense glacier of Greenland that covers that island. There are sign s that a retreat of the glacier s was interrupted by a new massing of ice, and that their borders differed at various times. Geologists are able to find the boundaries of the glaciers. Ice moves very slowly, pushing st ones before it, and accumulations of stones or moraines remain when the glacier retreats melting away. Traces have been found of five or six consecutive displacements of the ice sheet during the Ice Age, or of five or six glacial periods. Some force repeatedly pushed the ice sheet toward moderate latitudes. Neither the cau se of the ice ages nor the cause of the retreat of the icy desert is known; the time of these retreats is also a matter of speculation. Many ideas were offered and guesses made to explain how the glacial epochs originated and why they terminated. Some supposed that the sun at different times emits more or less heat, which causes periods of heat and cold on the earth; but no evidence that th e sun is such a \"variable star\" was adduced to support this hypothesis. Others conjectured that cosmic space has warmer and cooler areas, and that when our solar system travels through the cooler areas, ice descends upon latitudes closer to the tropics. But no physical agents were found responsible for such hypothetical cold and warm areas in space. A few wondered whether the precession of the equinoxes or the slow change in the direction of the terrestrial axis might cause periodic variations in the climate. But it was shown that the difference in insolation could not have been grea t enough to have been responsible for the glacial ages. Still others thought to find the answer in the peri odic variations in the ecc entricity of the ecliptic (terrestrial orbit), with glaciation at the maxima l eccentricity. Some of them supposed that winter in aphelion, the remotest part of the ecliptic, would cause glaciation; and some thought that summer in aphelion would produce that effect. 22  WORLDS IN COLLISION Some scholars thought about the changes in the positi on of the terrestrial axis. If the planet earth is rigid, as it is regarded to be (L. Kelvin), th e axis could not have shif ted in geological times by more than three degrees (George Darwin); if it were elastic, it could ha ve shifted up to ten or fifteen degrees in a very slow process. The cause of the ice ages was seen by a few schol ars in the decrease of the original heat of the planet; the warm periods between the ice ages were attributed to the heat set free by a hypothetical decomposition of organisms in the st rata close to the surface of the ground. The increase and decrease in the action of warm springs were also considered. Others supposed that dust of volcanic origin filled the terrestrial atmosphere and hindered insolation, or, contrariwise, that an increased content of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere obstructed the reflection of heat rays from the surface of the planet. A de crease in the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would cause a fall of temperatur e (Arrhenius), but calculations were made to show that this could not be th e real cause of the gl acial ages (Angstrom). robin-bobin"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Changes in the direction of warm currents in the Atlantic Ocean were brought into the discussion, and the Isthmus of Panama was theore tically removed to allow the Gulf Stream to pass into the Pacific at the time of the glacial pe riods.

The periodic re treats of ice between the glacial periods would have required periodic removal and replacement of the Isthmus of Panama. Other theories of equally hypothe tical nature were proposed; but the phenomena held responsible for the changes have not been proved to have exis ted, or to have been able to produce the effect. All the above-mentioned theories and hypotheses fail if they cannot meet a most important condition: In order for ice masses to have been formed, increased precipitation must have taken place. This requires an increased amount of water vapor in the atmosphere, which is the result of increased evaporation from the surface of WORLDS IN COLLISION  23 oceans; but this could be caused by heat only. A nu mber of scientists pointed out this fact, and even calculated that in order to produce a sheet of ice as large as that of the Ice Age, the surface of all the oceans must have evaporated to a dept h of many feet. Such an evaporation of oceans followed by a quick process of freezing, even in mode rate latitudes, would have produced the ice ages. The problem is: What could have caused the evaporation and im mediately subsequent freezing? As the cause of such quick alternati on of heating and freezing of large parts of the globe is not apparent, it is con ceded that \"at present the caus e of excessive ice-making on the lands remains a baffling mystery, a major question for the future reader of earth's riddles.\" 1 Not only are the causes of the appearance and later disappearance of the glacial sheet unknown, but the geographical shape of the area covered by ice is also a probl em. Why did the glacial sheet, in the southern hemisphere, move from the tropical regions of Africa toward the south polar region and not in the opposit e direction, and, similarly, why, in the northern hemisphere, did the ice move in India from the equator toward the Himalaya mountains and the higher latitudes? Why did the glaciers of the Ice Age cover the greater part of North America and Europe, while the north of Asia remained free? In America the plateau of ice stretched up to latitude 40° and even passed acr oss this line; in Europe it reached latitude 50°; while northeastern Siberia, above the pol ar circle, even above latitude 75°, was not covered with this perennial ice. All hypotheses regarding increased and diminished insolation due to solar alterations or the changing temperature of the cosmic space, and other similar hypotheses, cannot avoid being confronted with this problem. Glaciers are formed in the regions of eternal s now; for this reason they remain on the slopes of the high mountains. The north of Siberia is the coldest place in the world. Why did not the Ice Age touch this region, whereas it visited the basin of the Mississi ppi and all Africa south of the equator? No satisfactory solution to this question has been proposed. 1 R. A.

Cuvier wrote of the extinction of the mammoths: \"Repeated irruptions and retreats of the sea have neither all been slow nor gradual; on the contrary, most of the catastrophes which have occasioned them have been sudden; and this is esp ecially easy to be proved with regard to the last of these catastrophes, that which, by a twofold 1 Observation of D.

If they had not been frozen as soon as killed, they would have been decomposed by putrefac tion. And, on the other hand, this eternal frost could not previously have occupied the places in which they have been seized by it, for they could not have lived in such a temperature. It wa s, therefore, at one and the same moment that these animals were destroyed and the country which they inhabited became covered with ice. This event has been sudden, instantaneous, w ithout any gradation, and what is so clearly demonstrated with respect to this last catastrophe , is not less so with reference to those which have preceded it.\" 2 The theory of repeated catastrophe s annihilating life on this plan et and repeated creations or restorations of life, offered by Deluc 3 and expanded by Cuvier, did not convince the scientific world. Like Lamarck before Cuvier, Darwin after him thought that an exceedingly slow evolutional process governs ge netics, and that there were no catastrophes interrupting this process of infinitesimal changes. According to the theory of evolu tion, these minute changes came as a result of adaptation to living conditions in the struggle of the species for survival. Like the theories of Lamarck and Darwin, which pos tulate slow changes in animals, with tens of thousands of years required for a minute step in evolution, the geological theories of the nineteenth century, and of the twentieth as well , regard the geological processes as exceedingly slow and dependent on erosion by rain, wind, and tides. Darwin admitted that he was unable to find an explanation for the extermination of the mammoth, an animal better developed than 2 Cuvier, Essay on the Theory of the Earth, pp. 14-15. SJ. A.

The Ice Age and the Antiquity of Man The mammoth lived in the age of man.

If this is so, the Siberian mammoth was also the contemporary of a rather modern man. At a time when in Europe, close to the ice sh eet, man was still in the later stag es of neolithic culture, in the Near and Middle East—the region of the great cultures of antiquity—he may already have progressed well into the metal age. There exists no chronological table of neolithic culture because the art of writing was invented approxi mately at the advent of the copper—the early— period of the Bronze Age. It is presumed that th e neolithic man of Europe left pictures but no inscriptions, and consequently there are no means of determining the end of the Ice Age in terms of chronology. Geologists have tried to find the time of the e nd of the last glacial period by measuring the detritus carried by rivers from the glaciers and the deposits of detritus in lakes. The quantity carried by the Rhone from the glaciers of the Al ps and the amount on the bottom of the Lake of Geneva, through which the Rhone flows, were calculated, and from the figures obtained the time and velocity of the retreat of th e glacial sheet of the last glacia l period were estimated. According to the Swiss scholar Francois Forel, twelve thousand years ha ve passed since the time the ice sheet of the last glacial period began to melt, an unexpectedly low figure, as it was thought that the ice age ended thirty to fifty thousand years ago. Such calculations suffer from being only indirect evaluations; and since the velocity at which the glacial mud had been deposited in the lakes wa s not constant and the amount varied, the mud must have assembled on the bottom of a lake at a faster rate in the beginning when the glaciers were larger; and if the Ice Age terminated suddenly,'the deposition of detritus would have been much heavier at first, and there would be little analogy to the accumulation of detritus from the seasonal melting of snow in the Alps. Therefore, the time that has elapsed since the end of the last glacial period must have b een even shorter than reckoned. Geologists regard the Great Lakes of America as having been formed at the end of the Ice Age when the continental glacier retreated and the de pressions freed from the glacier became lakes.

WORLDS IN COLLISION  29 have been already employed in the centers of an cient civilization, the reco rds written in rocks by nature and the records written by man must give a coordinated picture. Let us, therefore, investigate the traditions and the literary reco rds of ancient man, and compare them with the records of nature. The World Ages A conception of ages that were brought to thei r end by violent changes in nature is common all over the world. The number of ages differs from people to people and from tradition to tradition. The difference depends on the number of catastrophes that the particular people retained in its memory, or on the way it reckoned the end of an age. In the annals of ancient Etruria, according to Varro, were records of seven elapsed ages. Censorinus, an author of the th ird Christian century and compil er of Varro, wrote that \"men thought that different prodigies appeared by means of which the gods notified mortals at the end of each age. The Etruscans were versed in the sc ience of the stars, and after having observed the prodigies with attention, they recorded these observations in their books.\"* The Greeks had similar traditions. \"There is a period,\" wrote Censorinus , \"called 'the supreme year' by Aristotle, at the end of which the sun, m oon, and all the planets retu rn to their original position. This 'supreme year' has a great winter, called by the Greeks kata-klysmos, which means deluge, and a great summer, called by the Greeks ekpyrosis, or combustion of the world. The world, actually, seems to be inundated and burned alternately in each of these epochs.\" Anaximenes and Anaximander in the sixth pre-Ch ristian century, and Diogenes of Apollonia in the fifth century, assumed the destruction of the world with subsequent recreation. Heraclitus (- 540 to -475) taught that the wo rld is destroyed in conflagr ation after every period of 10,800 years.

The Stoi cs generally believed in periodic conflagrations by which the world was consumed, to be shaped anew. \"This is due to the forces of ever-active fire which exists in things and in the course of long cycles of time resolves everything into itself and out of it is constructed a reborn world\" —so Philo presented the notion of the Stoics that our world is refashioned in periodic conflagrations.2 In one su ch catastrophe the world will meet its ultimate destruction; colliding with anot her world, it will fall apart into atoms out of which, in a long process, a new earth will be created somewher e in the universe. \"Democritus and Epicurus,\" explained Philo, \"postulate many worlds, the origin of which they ascribe to the mutual impacts and interlacing of atoms, and their destruction to the counterbl ows and collisions by the bodies so formed.\" As this earth goes to its ultimate destruction, it passes through recurring cosmic catastrophes and is re-formed w ith all that lives on it. Hesiod, one of the earliest Greek au thors, wrote about four ages a nd four generations of men that were destroyed by the wrath of the planetary gods. The third age was the age of bronze; when it was destroyed by Zeus, a new generation repeop led the earth, and using bronze for arms and tools, they began to use iron, too. The heroes of the Trojan War were of this fourth generation. Then a new destruction was decreed, and after th at came \"yet another generation, the fifth, of men who are upon the bounteous earth\"—the genera tion of iron.3 In another work of his, Hesiod described the end of one of the ages. \"The life-giving earth cras hed around in burning ... all the land seethed, and the Ocean's streams ... it seemed even as if Earth and wide Heaven above came together; for such a mighty crash would have aris en if Earth were bei ng hurled to ruin, and Heaven from on high were hurling her down.\" 4 Analogous traditions of four expire d ages persist on the shores of 2 Philo, On the Eternity of the World (transl. F. H. Colson, 1941), Sec. 8. s Hesiod, Works and Days (transl. H. G. Evelyn-White, 1914), 1. 169. 4 Hesiod, Theogony (transl. Evelyn-White, 1914), 11. 693 ff.

The world ages are called Kalpas or Yugas. Each world age met its destructi on in catastrophes of conflagration, flood, and hurricane.

In the chronicles of the Mexican kingdom it is said: \"The ancients knew that before the present sky and earth were formed, man was already created and life had manifested itself four times.\" 16 A tradition of successive creati ons and catastrophes is found in the Pacific—on Hawaii17 and on the islands of Polynesia: there were nine ages and in each age a different sky was above the earth.18 Icelanders, too, believed that nine worlds went down in a succession of ages, a tradition that is contained in the Edda.19 12 G.

It underwen t reshaping, six consecutive remoldings. New conditions were created after each of the catastrophes.

Seven heavens were created and seven earths we re created: the most removed, the seventh, Eretz; the sixth, Adamah; the fifth, Arka; the fo urth, Harabah; the third, Yabbashah; the second, Tevel; and \"our own land called Heled, and like th e others, it is separated from the foregoing by abyss, chaos, and water.\"20 Great catastrophes changed the face of the earth. \"Some perished by deluge, others were consumed by conflagrat ion,\" wrote the Jewish philosopher Philo.21 According to the rabbinical authority Rashi, an cient tradition knows of pe riodic collapses of the firmament, one of which occurred in the days of the Deluge, and which repeated themselves at robin-bobin"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"intervals of 1,656 years.22 The dur ation of the world ages varies in Armenian and Arabian traditions.23 The Sun Ages An oft-repeated occurrence in the traditions of the world ages is the advent of a new sun in the sky at the beginning of every age.

The world age of the Hurricane Sun came to its destruction in a cosmic hurricane. The Fire Sun was the worl d age that went down in a rain of fire.3 \"The nations of Culhua or Mexico,\" Humboldt quoted G6ma ra, the Spanish writer of the sixteenth century, \"believe according to their hi eroglyphic paintings, that, previous to the sun which now enlightens them, four had already be en successively extinguished. These four suns are as many ages, in which our species has been annihilated by inundation s, by earthquakes, by a general conflagration, and by the effect of destroying tempests.\" * Every one of the four elements participated in each of the catastrophes; deluge, hurrican e, earthquake, and fire gave their names to the catastrophes because of the predominance of one of them in the upheavals. Symbols of the successive suns are painted on the pre-Columbian literary documents of Mexico.5 \"Cinco soles que son edades,\" or \"five suns that are epochs,\" wrote G6mara in his description of the conquest of Mexico.8 An analogy to this sentence of Gomara may be found in Lucius Ampelius, a Roman author, who, in his book Liber memorialis, wrote: 7 \"Soles fuere quinque\" (There were five suns): It is the same belief that Gomara found in the New World.

In all quoted sources the \"suns\" are explained (by the sources themselves) as signifying consecutive epochs, each of which went down in a great, general destruction.

PART I Venus No book, or collection of books, in the history of mankind has had a more attentive reading, a wider circulation, or more dilig ent investigation than the Old Testament. —R. H. Pfeiffer, Introduction to the Old Testament CHAPTER 1 The Most Incredible Story T'HE MOST incredible story of miracles is told about Joshua ben Nun who, when pursuing the Canaanite kings at Beth-horon, implored the sun a nd the moon to stand still. \"And he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand t hou still upon Gibeon; and thou, M oon, in the valley of Ajalon. And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jash er? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day\" (Joshua 10:12-13). This story is beyond the belief of even the most imaginative or the most pious person. Waves of stormy sea may have drowned one host and been merciful to another. The earth could crack asunder and swallow up human beings. The Jordan could be blocked by a slice of its bank falling into the bed of the rive r. Jericho's walls—not by the blast of trumpets, but by an incidental earthquake—could have been breached. But that the sun and the moon should halt in their movement across the firmament—this could be only the product of fancy, a poetic image, a metaphor;1 a hideous implausibility when imposed as a subject for belief;2 a matter for sc orn—it manifests even a want of reverence for the Supreme Being. 1 \"Certainly one could not conceive a more effective flight of fancy, or one more fitted for the heights of one heroic and lyrical composition.\" G.

Is such a disturbance conceiva ble? No record of the slightest confusion is registered in the present annals of the earth. Each year cons ists of 365 days, 5 hours, and 49 minutes. A departure of the earth from its regular rotatio n is thinkable, but only in the very improbable event that our planet should meet another heavenly body of suffici ent mass to disrupt the eternal path of our world. It is true that aerolites or me teorites reach our earth continually, sometimes by the thousands and tens of thousands. But no dislocation of our precise turning round and round has ever been perceived. This does not mean that a larger body, or a la rger number of bodies, could not strike the terrestrial sphere. The large number of asteroids between the orbits of the planets Mars and Jupiter suggests that at some unknown time an other planet revolved there; now only these meteorites follow approximately the path along which the destroyed planet circled the sun. Possibly a comet ran into it and shattered it. That a comet may strike our planet is not very probable, but the idea is not absurd. The heavenly mechanism works with almost absolute precisio n; but unstable, their way lost, comets by the thousands, by the millions, revolve in the sky, and their interference may disturb the harmony. Some of these comets belong to our system. Pe riodically they return, but not at very exact intervals, owing to the perturba tions caused by gravitation toward the larger planets when they fly too close to them. But innumerable other co mets, often seen only th rough the telescope, come flying in from immeasurable spaces of the uni verse at very great speed, and disappear—possibly forever. Some comets are visible only for hour s, some for days or weeks or even months. concerning the wonder of the sun standing still: \"The Scripture did not intend to teach men philosophy, or accommodate itself to the true and Pythagoric system of the world.\" And again: \"The prophets and holy penmen themselves . . . being seldom or never philosophers, were not capable of representing these things otherwise than they, with the vul gar, understood them.\" WORLDS IN COLLISION  41 Might it happen that our earth, the earth under our feet, would roll toward perilous collision with a huge mass of meteorites, a tra il of stones flying at enormous speed around and across our solar system? This probability was analyzed with fe rvor during the last cen tury. From the time of Aristotle, who asserted that a meteorite, which fell at Aegospotami when a comet was glowing in the sky, had been lifted from the ground by the wind and carried in the air and dropped over that place, until the year 1803 when, on April 26, a shower of meteorites fell at 1'Aigle in France and was investigated by Biot for the French Academ y of Sciences, the scholarly world—and in the meantime there lived Copernicus, Galileo Galilei, Kepler, Newton, and Huygens—did not believe that such a thing as a stone falling from the sky was possi ble at all. And this despite many occasions when stones fell before the eyes of a crowd, as did the aeroli te in the presence of Emperor Maximilian and his court in Ensisheim, Alsace, on November 7, 1492.3 Only shortly before 1803, the Academy of Sciences of Paris refused to believe that, on another occasion, stones had fallen from the sky. The fa ll of meteorites on July 24, 1790 in southwest France was pronounced \"un phenomene physiqueme nt impossible.\" 4 Since the year 1803, however, scholars have believed that stones fall from the sky. If a stone can collide with the earth, and occasionally a shower of stones, too, ca nnot a full-sized comet fl y into the face of the earth? It was calculated that such a possibility ex ists but that it is very unlikely to occur.5 If the head of a comet should pass very close to our path, so as to effect a distortion in the career of the earth, another phenomenon besides the dist urbed m ovement of the planet would probably occur: 3 C. P. Olivier, Meteors (1925), p. 4. 4 P. Bertholon, Vubhlicazionl della specola astronomica Vaticana (1913). 5 D. F. Arago computed on some occasion that there is one chance in 280 million that a comet will hit the earth.

While investigating whether an encoun ter between the earth and a comet had 42  WORLDS IN COLLISION a rain of meteorites would strike the earth a nd would increase to a torrent. Stones scorched by flying through the atmosphere would be hurled on home and head. In the Book of Joshua, two verses before the passage about the sun that was suspended on high for a number of hours without moving to the Occident, we find this passage: >\"As they [the Canaanite kings] fled from befo re Israel, and were in the going down to Beth- horon ... the Lord cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more which died with hail stones [sto nes of barad] than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.\" 6 The author of the Book of Joshua was surely ignorant of any conn ection between the two phenomena. He could not be expected to have had any knowledge about the nature of aerolites, about the forces of attraction between celestial bodies, and the like. As these phenomena were recorded to have occurred together, it is improbable that the records were invented. The meteorites fell on the earth in a torrent. They mu st have fallen in very great numbers for they struck down more warriors than th e swords of the adversaries. To have killed persons by the hundreds or thousands in th e field, a cataract of stones must have fallen. Such been the subject of a previous discussion, I found that W. Whiston, Newton's successor at Cambridge and a contemporary of Halley, in his Ne w Theory of the Earth (the first edition of which appeared in 1696) tried to prove that the comet of 1680, to which he (erroneously) ascribed a period of 575K years, caused the biblical Deluge on an early encounter. G. Cuvier, who was unable to offer his own explan ation of the causes of great cataclysms, refers to the theory of Whiston in the following terms: \"Whiston fancied that the earth was created from the atmosphere of one comet, and that it wa s deluged by the tail of another. The heat which remained from its first origin, in his opinion, excited the whole anted iluvian population, men and animals, to sin, for which they were all dr owned in the deluge, excepting the fish, whose passions were apparently less violent.\" I. Donnelly, author, reformer, and member of the United States House of Representatives, tried in his book Ragnarok (1883) to explain the presence of till and gravel on th e rock substratum in America and Europe by hypothesizing an encounte r with a comet, which rained till on the terrestrial hemisphere facing it at that moment. He placed the event in an indefinite period, but at a time when man already populated the earth. Donnelly did not show any awareness that Whiston was his predecessor. His assumption that th ere is till only in one half of the earth is arbitrary and wrong. 6 Joshua 10: 11. WORLDS IN COLLISION  43 a torrent of great stones would m ean that a train of meteorites or a comet had struck our planet. The quotation in the Bible from the Book of Jasher is laconic and may give the impression that the phenomenon of the motionless sun and moon wa s local, seen only in Palestine between the valley of Ajalon and Gibeon. But the cosmic ch aracter of the prodigy is pictured in a thanksgiving prayer ascribed to Joshua: Sun and moon stood still in heaven, and Thou didst stand in Thy wrat h against our oppressors. . . . All the princes of the earth stood up, the kings of the nations had gathered themselves together. . . . Thou didst destroy them in Thy fury, a nd Thou didst ruin them in Thy rage.

It appear s that a large comet must have passed very near to our planet and disrupted its movement; a part of the stones dispersed in the neck and tail of the comet smote the surface of our earth a shattering blow. Are we entitled, on the basis of the Book of Joshua, to assume that at some date in the middle of the second millennium before the present era the ear th was interrupted in its regular rotation by a comet? Such a statement has so many implications that it should not 1 Ginzberg, Legends, IV, 11-12. 44  WORLDS IN COLLISION be made thoughtlessly. To this I say that though the implications are great and many, the present research in its entirety is an interlinked seque nce of documents and othe r evidence, all of which in common carry the weight of this and other statements in this book. The problem before us is one of mechanics. Po ints on the outer layers of the rotating globe (especially near the equator) move at a higher linear velocity than points on the inner layers, but at the same angular velocity. C onsequently, if the earth were s uddenly stopped (or slowed down) in its rotation, the inner layers might come to re st (or their rotational ve locity might be slowed) while the outer layers would st ill tend to go on rotating. This would cause friction between the various liquid or semifluid laye rs, creating heat; on the outermo st periphery the solid layers would be torn apart, causing mountains and even continents to fall or rise. As I shall show later, mountains fell and others rose from level ground; the earth w ith its oceans and continents became heated; the sea boiled in many places, and rock liquefied; volcanoes ignited and forests burned. Would not a sudden st op by the earth, rotating at a little over one thousand miles an hour at its equator, mean a comp lete destruction of the world? Since the world survived, there must have been a mechanism to cushion the slowing down of terrestrial rotation, if it really occurred, or another escape for the energy of motion besides tr ansformation into heat, or both. Or if rotation persisted undisturbed, the terrestrial axis may have tilted in the presence of a strong magnetic field, so that th e sun appeared to lose for hours its diurnal movement.8 These problems are kept in sight and are faced in the Epilogue of this volume. On the Other Side of the Ocean > The Book of Joshua, compiled from the more ancient Book of Jasher, relates the order of events. \"Joshua . . . went up from Gilgal all ni ght.\" In the early morning he fell upon his enemies unawares at Gibeon, and \"chased them along the way that goes up to Beth- 8 This explanation was suggested to me by M.

It has been noted that this description of the pos ition of the luminaries implies that the sun was in the forenoon position.1 The Book of Jos hua says that the luminaries stood in the midst of the sky. Allowing for the difference in longitude, it must ha ve been early morning or night in the Western Hemisphere.

Also, the tradition preserved by Sahagun bears no trace of having been introduced by the missionaries: in his version there is nothing to suggest Joshua ben Nun and his war against the Canaan ite kings; and the position of th e sun, only a very little above the eastern horizon, differs from the bibli cal text, though it does not contradict it.

In the work Ages in Chaos, I describe at some length the catastrophe that visited Egypt and Arabia. In that work it is expl ained that the Exodus took place am id a great natural upheaval that terminated the period of Egyptian history know n as the Middle Kingdom.

Both works—the reconstruction of history and the reconstruction of natural history—were conceived within the short interval of half a year; the desire to estab lish a correct historical chronology be fore fitting the acts of nature into the periods of human hi story impelled me to complete Ages in Chaos first.3 I shall employ some of the historical material from the first chapters of Ages in Chaos. There I use it for the purpose of synchronizing events in the histories of the countries around the eastern Mediterranean; here I shall use it to show that the same events took place all around the world, and to explain the nature of these events. The Red World ^ In the middle of the second millennium before th e present era, as I intend to show, the earth underwent one of the greatest catastrophes in its hi story. A celestial body that only shortly before had become a member of the solar system—a new comet—came very close to the earth. The account of this catastrophe can be reconstructe d from evidence supplied by a large number of documents. The comet was on its way from its perihelion and touched the earth first with its gaseous tail. Later in this book I shall show th at it was about this comet that Servius wrote: \"Non igneo sed sanguineo rubore fuisse\" (It was not of a flaming but of a bloody redness). One of the first visible signs of this encounter was the reddening of the earth's surface by a fine dust of rusty pigment. In sea, lake, and river this pigment gave a bloody coloring to the water. Because of these particles of ferruginous or other soluble pigment, the world turned red. The Manuscript QuichS of the Mayas tells that in the Western Hemisphere, in the days of a great cataclysm, when the earth quaked 3 In order of publication it wi ll follow the present volume.

In one Egyptian myth the bloody hue of the world is ascribed to the blood of Osiris, the mortally wounded planet god; in another myth it is the blood of Seth or Apopi; in the Babylonian myth the world was colored red by the blood of the slain Tiamat, the heavenly monster.7 The Finnish epos of Kalevala describes how, in the days of the cosmic upheaval, the world was sprinkled with red milk.8 The Altai Tatars tell of a catastrophe when \"blood turns the whole world red,\" and a world conflagration follows.9 The Orphic hymns refer to the time when the heavenly vault, \"mighty Olympus, trembled fearfu lly . . . and the earth around shrieked fearfully, and the sea was stirred [heaped], tr oubled with its purple waves.\" 10 v An old subject for debate is: Why is the Red Se a so named? If a sea is called Black or White, that may be due to the dark coloring of the wate r or to the brightness of the ice and snow. The Red Sea has a deep blue color. As no better re ason was found, a few coral formations or some red birds on its shores were proposed as explanations of its name.11 Like all the water in Egypt, the water on the surfa ce of the Sea of the Passage was of a red tint. It appears that Raphael was not mistaken when, in painting the scene of the passage, he colored the water red. It was, of course, not this mount ain or that river or that sea exclusively that was reddened, thus earning the name Red or Bloody, as distinguished from other mountai ns and seas. But crowds of men, wherever they were, who witnessed the co smic upheaval and escaped with their lives, ascribed the name Haemus or Red to particular places. * The Seven Tablets of Creation, ed. L.

Naphtha Crude petroleum is composed of two elements, carbon and hydrogen. The main theories of the origin of petroleum are: 1. The inorganic theory: Hydroge n and carbon were brought together in the rock formations of the earth under great heat and pressure. 2. The organic theory: Both the hydrogen and carbon which compose petroleum come from the remains of plant and animal life, in the ma in from microscopic marine and swamp life. The organic theory implies that the process starte d after life was already abundant, at least at the bottom of the ocean.1 The tails of comets are composed mainly of carbon and hydrogen gases. Lacking oxygen, they do not burn in flight, but the inflammable gases, passing through an atmosphere containing oxygen, will be set on fire. If carbon and hydrogen ga ses, or vapor of a composition of these two elements, enter the atmosphere in huge masses, a part of them will burn, binding all the oxygen available at the moment; the 6 \"World Cycles,\" Visuddhi-Magga, in Warren, Buddhism in Translations, p. 328. 6 Alexander, Latin American Mythology, p. 72. 1 Even before Plutarch the problem of the orig in of petroleum was much discussed.

Th e Israelites continued on their way. Then came the revolt of Korah and his confederates. \"And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up. . . . And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them. . . . And there came out a fire from the Lord, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense.\" 13 When they kindled the fire of incense, the vapors which rose out of the cleft in the rock caught the flame and exploded. Unaccustomed to handling this oil, rich in volatile derivatives, the Israelite priests fell victims to the fire. The two elder sons of Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, \"died before the Lord, when they offered strange fire before the Lord, in the w ilderness of Sinai.\"14 The fire was called strange because it had not been known before a nd because it was of foreign origin.

The Darkness The earth entered deeper into the tail of the onrus hing comet and approached its body. This approach, if one is to believe the sources, was followed by a disturbance in the rotation of the earth. Terrific hurricanes swept the earth because of the ch ange or reversal of the angular velocity of rotation and because of the sweep ing gases, dust, and cinders of the comet. Numerous rabbinical sources describe the calamity of darkness; the material is collated as follows: x An exceedingly strong wind endured seven days. A ll the time the land was shrouded in darkness. \"On the fourth, fifth, and sixth days, the darkness was so dense that they [the people of Egypt] could not stir from their place.\" \"The darkness was of such a nature that it could not be dispelled by artificial means. The light of the fire was eith er extinguished by the violence of storm, or else it was made invisible and swallowed up in the de nsity of the darkness. . . . Nothing could be discerned. . . . None was able to speak or to he ar, nor could anyone venture to take food, but they lay themselves down 1 Ginzberg, Legends, II, 360. WORLDS IN COLLISION  59 , . . their outward senses in a trance. Thus they remained, overwhelmed by the affliction.\" The darkness was of such kind that \"their eyes were blinded by it and their breath choked\"; 2 it was \"not of ordinary earthy ki nd.\" 3 The rabbinical tradition, c ontradicting the spirit of the Scriptural narrative, states that during the plague of darkness the va st majority of the Israelites perished and that only a small fraction of the or iginal Israelite population of Egypt was spared to leave Egypt. Forty-nine out of ever y fifty Israelites are said to ha ve perished in this plague.4 wA shrine of black granite found at el-Arish on th e border of Egypt and Palestine bears a long inscription in hieroglyphics. It reads: \"The land was in great aff liction. Evil fell on this earth. . . . There was a great upheaval in th e residence. . . . Nobody could l eave the palace [there was no exit from the palace] during nine days, and during these nine days of upheaval there was such a tempest that neither men nor gods [the royal family ] could see the faces of those beside them.\" 5 This record employs the same description of the darkness as Exodus 10 : 22: \"And there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days. They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days.\" The difference in the number of the days (three and nine) of the dar kness is reduced in the rabbinical sources, where the time is given as se ven days. The difference between seven and nine days is negligible if one considers the subjec tivity of the time estimation under such conditions. Appraisal of the darkness with respect to its impe netrability is also subjective; rabbinical sources say that for part of the time there was a very slig ht visibility, but for the rest (three days) there was no visibility at all. 2 Josephus, Jewish Antiquities (transl.

If the earth did not stop rotating but slowed down or was tilted, there must have been a longitude where a prolonged day was followed by a prolonged ni ght.

The Egyptian word for \"to overturn\" is used in the sense of \"to overthrow a wall.\" 2 This was the tenth plague. \"And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; fo r there was not a house wh ere there was not one dead\" (Exodus 12:30). Houses fell, smitten by one violent blow. \"[The angel of the Lord] passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he sm ote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses\" (Exodus 12:27). Nogaf, meaning \"smote,\" is the word used for a very violent blow, as, for instance, goring by the horns of an ox. Th e Passover Haggadah says: \"The firstborn of the Egyptians didst Thou crush at midnight.\" . The reason why the Israelites were more fortunate in this plague than the Egyptians probably lies in the kind of material of which their dwellings were constructed. Occupying a marshy district and working on clay, the captives must have lived in huts made of clay and reeds, which are more resilient than brick or stone. \"The Lo rd will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come and smite your houses.\" 3 An example of the selectiv e action of a natural agent upon various kinds of construction is na rrated also in Mexican annals. During a catastrophe accompanied by hurricane and earthquake , only the people who lived in small log cabins remained uninjured; the larger buildings were swept away. \"The y found that those who lived in small houses had escaped, as well as th e newly-married couples, whose custom it was to live for a few years in cabins in fron t of those of their fathers-in-law.\"4 robin-bobin"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"In Ages in Chaos (my reconstruction of ancient hi story), I shall show that \"first-born\" (bkhor) in the text of the plague is a corr uption of \"chosen\" (bchor).

I shall bid the rivers flow upward; I shall cause the sea to gather togeth er itself up into a huge towering wall which I shall hurl upon your wicked earth-children, a nd thus destroy them and all life.'\" Jubmel set a storm-wind blowing, and the wild air-spirits raging. . . . Foaming, dashing, rising sky-high came the sea-wall, crushing all things . Jubmel, with one strong upheaval, made the earth-lands all turn over; then, the world again he righted. Now the mountains and the highlands could no more be seen by Beijke [sun]. Filled with groans of dying people, was the fair earth, home of mankind. No more Beijke shone in heaven. According to the Lapland epic, the world was ove rwhelmed by the hurricane and the sea, and almost all human beings perished. After the sea-wall fell on the contin ent, gigantic waves continued to roll and dead bodies were dashed about in dark waters. The great earthquake and the chas ms that opened in the ground, the appearance of a celestial body with serpentlike flashes, rivers flowi ng upward, a sea-wall that crushed everything, mountains that became leveled or covered with wa ter, the world that was turned over and then righted, the sun that no more shone in the s ky—all these are motifs which we found in the description of the calamities of the time of the Exodus. In many places of the world, and especially in the north, large boulders are found in a position which proves that a great force must have lifted them up and carried them long distances before depositing them where they are foun d today. Sometimes these large loose WORLDS IN COLLISION  75 rocks are of entirely different mineral compos ition than the local rocks, but are akin to formations many miles away. Thus, occasionally an erratic boulder of granite perches on top of a high ridge of dolerite, whereas the nearest outcrops of granite lie far awa y. These erratic boulders may weigh as much as ten thousand tons, about as much as one hundred thirty thousand people.18 To explain these facts, the schol ars of the first half of the ni neteenth century assumed that enormous tides had swept over the continents and carried with them masses of stone. The robin-bobin"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"transfer of the rocks was explaine d by the tides, but what could have caused those billows to rise high over the continents? \"It was conceived that somehow and somewhere in the far north a series of gigantic waves was mysteriously propagated. These waves were suppos ed to have precipitated themselves upon the land, and then swept madly on over mountain an d valley alike, carryi ng along with them a mighty burden of rocks and stones and rubbish. Such deluges were styled 'waves of translation'; and the till was believed to represent the materi als which they hurried al ong with them in their wild course across the country.\" 10 The stones and boulders on the hilltops and the mounds of sand and gravel in the lowlands we re explained by this theory. Critics, however, maintained that \"it was unfortunate for this view that it violated at the very outset the firs t principles of science, by assuming the former existence of a cause whic h there was little in nature to warrant . . . spasmodic rushes of the sea ac ross a whole country had fortunately never been experienced within the memory of man.\" 20 Th at the correctness of the last se ntence is questionable is shown by references to the traditions of a number of peoples. Wherever possible, the movement of stones was attributed to the progress of the ice sheet in the glacial ages and to glaciers on the mountain slopes. 18 The Madison boulder near Conway, New Hampshire, measures 90 by 40 by 38 feet, and weighs almost 10,000 tons. \"It is co mposed of granite, quite unlik e the bedrock beneath it; hence the boulder is typically 'erratic'\" Daly, The Changing World of the Ice Age, p. 16. 19 J. Geikie, The Great Ice Age and Its Relation to the Antiquity of Man (1894), pp. 25-26. 20 Ibid. 76  WORLDS IN COLLISION Agassiz, in 1840, assumed that just as the Alpine moraines were left behind by the retreating glaciers, so the moraines in the flat-lands of northern Europe and America could have been caused by the movement of great continental ice sheets (and thus introduced the theory of ice ages). Although this is correct to some extent, th e analogy is not exact, as the glaciers of the Alps push the stones down, not up the slope. Meeting an upward motion of the ice, large boulders would probably sink into the ice. The problem of the migration of the stones must be regarded as only partia lly connected with the progress and retreat of the ice sheet, if at all. Billows miles high traveled over the land, originating in causes described in this book. It can be established by the extent of denudation of the rocks under the er ratic boulders that the latter were deposited at their places during human history. So, for instance, in Wales and Yorkshire, where this effect was evaluated in terms of time, the \"a mount of denudation of limestone rocks on which boulders li e\" is a \"proof that a period of no more than six thousand years has elapsed since the boulders were left in their positions.\" 21 The fact that accumulations of stones were tr ansferred from the equator toward the higher latitudes, an enigmatic problem in the ice theo ry, can be explained by the poleward recession of the equatorial waters at the moment the velocity of rotation of the earth was reduced or its poles were shifted. In the Northern Hemisphere, in In dia, the moraines were carried from the equator not only toward higher latitudes, but also toward the Himalaya Mountains, and in the Southern Hemisphere from the equatorial regions of Africa toward the highe r latitudes, across the prairies and deserts and forests of the black continent. The Battle in the Sky At the same time that the seas were heaped up in immense tides, a pageant went on in the sky which presented itself to the horrified onlookers on earth as a gigantic bat tle. Because this battle was seen 21 Upham, The Glacial Lake Agassiz (1895), p. 239.

Emerging from the darkness, the Eastern Hemisphere faced the head of the comet. This head only shortly before had passed close to the sun and was in a state of candescence. The ni ght the great earthquake shook the globe was, according to rabbinical literature, as bright as the day of the summer solstice. Because of the proximity of the earth, the comet left its own orb it and for a while followed the orbit of the earth. The great ball of the comet retreated, then again approached the earth, shrouded in a dark column of gases which looked like a pillar of smoke duri ng the day and of fire at night, and the earth once more passed through the atmosphere of the co met, this time at its neck. This stage was accompanied by violent and incessant electrical di scharges between the atmosphere of the tail and the terrestrial atmosphere. There was an inte rval of about six days between these two close approaches. Emerging from the gases of the comet, the earth seems to have changed the direction of its rotation, and the pillar of smoke moved to the opposite horizon.1 The column looked like a gigantic moving serpent. When the tidal waves rose to their highest point , and the seas were to rn apart, a tremendous spark flew between the earth and the globe of the comet, which instantly pushed down the miles- high billows. Meanwhile, the tail of the comet and its head, having become entangled with each other by their close contact with the earth, exchanged violent discharges of el ectricity. It looked like a battle between the brillia nt globe and the dark column of smoke. In the exchange of electrical potentials, the tail a nd the head were attracted one to the other and repelled one from the other. From the serpentlike tail extensions gr ew, and it lost the form of a column. It looked now like a furious animal with le gs and with many heads. The di scharges tore the column to pieces, a process that was accompanied by a rain of 1 Cf. Exodus 14 : 19. 78  WORLDS IN COLLISION meteorites' upon the earth. It appeared as though th e monster were defeated by the brilliant globe and buried in the sea, or wherever the meteor ites fell. The gases of the tail subsequently enveloped the earth. The globe of the comet, which lo st a large portion of its atmosphere as well as much of its electrical potential, withdrew from the earth but did not br eak away from its attraction. Apparently, after a six-week interval, the distan ce between the earth and the globe of the comet again diminished. This new approach of the globe could not be readily observed because the earth was shrouded in the clouds of dust left by the comet on its former approach as well as by dust ejected by the volcanoes. After renewed discharges, the comet a nd the earth parted. This behavior of the comet is of great importanc e in problems of celestial mechanics. That a comet, encountering a planet, can become entangl ed and drawn away from its own path, forced into a new course, and finally liberated from the influence of the planet is proved by the case of Lexell's comet, which in 1767 was captured by Jupiter and its moons. Not until 1779 did it free itself from this entanglement. A phenomenon that has not been observed in modern times is an electrical discharge between a pl anet and a comet and also between the head of a comet and its trailing part. The events in the sky were viewed by the peoples of the world as a fight between an evil monster in the form of a serpent and the light-god who e ngaged the monster in battle and thus saved the world. The tail of the comet, leaping back and forth under the discharges of the flaming globe, was regarded as a separate body, inim ical to the globe of the comet. A full survey of the religious and folklore motifs which mirror this event would require more space than is at my disposal here; it is difficult to find a people or tribe on the earth that does not have the same motif at the very focus of its religious beliefs.2 Since the descriptions of the battle between Ma rduk and Tiamat, the dragon, or Isis and Seth, or Vishnu and the serpent, or Krishna 2 I intend to handle a portion of this m aterial in an essay on The Dragon.

There, seeing the monster so re wounded, he grappled with him. But Typhon twined about him and gripped him in his coils. . . .\" \"Having recove red his strength Zeus suddenly from heaven riding in a chariot of wi nged horses, pelted Typhon with thunderbolts. ... So being again pursued he [Typhon] came to Thrace and in fighting at Mount Haemus he heaved whole mountains ... a stream of blood gushed out on the mountain, and they say that from that circumstance the mountain was called Haemus [b loody].

Similar descriptions come from various places of the ancient world, in which the nations relate the experience of their ancestors who witnessed the great catastrophe of the middle of the second millennium. -At that time the Israelites had not yet arrived at a clear monotheistic concept and, like other peoples, they saw in the great st ruggle a conflict betw een good and evil. The author of the Book of Exodus, suppressing this concepti on of the ancient Israelites, pres ented the portent of fire and smoke moving in a column as an angel or me ssenger of the Lord. However, many passages in other books of the Scriptures preserved the pict ure as it impressed it self upon eyewitnesses. Rahab is the Hebrew name for the contester with the Most High. \"O Lord God of hosts, who is a strong Lord like unto thee? . . . Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces. . . . The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: as for th e world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them. The north and the south thou hast created them.\"6 Deutero-Isaiah prayed: \"Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the Lord; awake as in the ancient days, in the generations of old. Art thou not it that hath cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon? Art thou not it which hath dried th e sea, the waters of the great deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over?\" 7 From these passages it is clear that the battle of the Lord with Rahab was not a primeval battle before Creation, as some .scholars think.8 Isaiah prophesied for the future: \"In that day the Lord with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea.\" 9 The \"crooked serpent\" is shown in many ancient pictures from 6 Psalms 89 : 10-12. * Isaiah 51 : 9-10. * See S.

In the same pit of the sea lie the pharaoh and his hosts.3 s Up to now I have identified Rahab-Typhon as a comet. But if Typhon lies on the bottom of the sea, is he not the pharaoh? This would mean that in the legend of Typhon two el ements were welded together: the pharaoh, who perished in the catastrophe, and the outrageous rebel agai nst Zeus, the lord of the sky.4 \\ In Pliny's Natural History, the nine ty-first section of the second book reads: 5 \"A terrible comet was seen by the people of Ethiopia and Egypt, to which Typhon, the king of that period, gave his name; it had a fiery appearance and was twisted like a coil, and it was very grim to behold: it was not really a star so much as what might be called a ball of fire.\" The visit of a disastrous comet, so many times refe rred to in this book, is told in plain words, not in disguise. However, I must find support for my assumption that the comet of the days of King Typhon was the comet of the days of the Exodus. I investigated the writings of the old chronograp hers, and in Cometographia of Hevelius (1688) I found references to the works of Calvisius, Helvicus, Herlicius, and Rockenbach, all of whom used manuscripts for the most part and not printe d sources, as they lived only a little over one century after the invention of movable characte rs and the printing pre ss. ^ Hevelius wrote (in Latin): \"In the year of the world 2453 (1495 b.c), according to certain authorities, a comet was seen in Syria, 3 In Ages in Chaos, evidence will be presente d to identify the pharaoh of the Exodus as Taui Thom, the last king of the Middle Kingdom. He is Tau Timaeus (Tutimaeus) of Manetiio, in whose days \"a blast of God's displeasure\" fell upon Egypt and terminated the period at present known as the Middle Kingdom. The name of his qu een is given in the naos of el-Arish as Tephnut. Ra-uah-ab is a name met among th e Egyptian kings of that period (W.M.F. Petrie, A History of Egypt, I, 227); it could have se rved as origin for the Hebrew word for dragon, Rahab. See note 4. 4 Actually, \"dragon\" became the appellation of E gyptian pharaohs in the prophetic literature. Cf. Ezekiel 32 : 2. 5 Pliny, Natural History, ii, 91 (transl. Rackham, 1938).

With the rise of the monotheistic concept, the Israelites regarded this crooked serpent, the contester with the Most High, as the Lord's own creation. \"He stretcheth out the north ove r the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing. . . . The pillars of heaven tremble. . . . He divideth th e sea with his power ... his hand hath formed the crooked serpent.\" 10 The Psalmist also says: \" \"God is my King of old. . . . Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength. . . . Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces. . . . Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: Thou driedst up mighty rivers.\" The sea was cleft, the earth was cut with furrows, great rivers di sappeared, others appeared. The earth rumbled for many years, and the peoples thought that the fiery dragon that had been struck down had descended underground and was groaning there. The Comet of Typhon Of all the mysterious phenomena which accompanie d the Exodus, this mysterious Pillar seems the first to demand explanation. —W. Phythian-Adams The Call of Israel One of the places of the heavenly combat betw een elementary forces of nature—as narrated by Apollodorus and Strabo—was on th e way from Egypt to Syria.1 According to Herodotus, the final act of the fight between Zeus and Typhon took place at Lake Serbon on the coastal route robin-bobin"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"from Egypt to Palestine.2 On the way from Egypt to Palestine the Israel ites, after a night of terror and strong east wind, witne ssed the upheaval of the day of the Passage.

Its author was professor of Greek, mathematics, and law, and dean of philosophy at Frankfort. He wrote his book using old sources which he did not name: \"ex pro-batissimis ir antiquissimis veterum scriptoribus\" (from the most trustw orthy and the most ancient of th e early writers). As a result of his diligent gathering of ancient ma terial, he made the following entry: \"In the year of the world tw o thousand four hundred and fifty-three—as many trustworthy authors, on the basis of many c onjectures, have determined—a comet appeared which Pliny also mentioned in his second book. It was fiery, of irre gular circular form, w ith a wrapped head; it was in the shape of a globe and was of terrible as pect. It is said that King Typhon ruled at that time in Egypt. . . . Certain [authorit ies] assert that the comet was se en in Syria, Babylonia, India, in the sign of Capricorn, in the form of a disc, at the time when the children of Israel advanced from Egypt toward the Promised Land, led on their way by the pillar of cloud during the day and by the pillar of fire at night.\" 8 Rockenbach did not draw any conclusion on the relation of the comet of the days of Exodus to the natural phenomena of that time; his intent was only to fix the date of the comet of Typhon.

Its movement was slow, its path was close to the sun. Its color was bloody: \"It wa s not of fiery, but of bloody redness.\" It caused destruction \"in rising and setting.\" Servius writes that this come t caused many plagues, evils, and hunger. To discover what were the manuscript sources of Abraham Rocken-bach that led him to the same conclusion at which we have arrived, namely, th at the Typhon comet appear ed in the time of the Exodus, is a task not yet accomplished. Servius says that more information about the calamities caused by this comet is to be found in the writin gs of the Roman astrologer Campester and in the works of the Egyptian astrologer Petosiris.10 It is possible that c opies of works of some authors robin-bobin"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"containing citations from the writings of these an cient astrologers, preserved in the libraries of Europe, were Rockenbach's manuscript sources. Campester, as quoted by Lydus, was certain th at should the comet Typhon again meet the earth, a four-day encounter would suffice to destroy the world.11 This implies also that the first encounter with the comet Typhon brought th e earth to the brink of destruction. But even without this somber prognostication of Campester, we have a very imposing and quite inexhaustible array of references to Typhon and its destructive action agai nst the world: almost every Greek author referred to it.

See Pauly-Wissowa, R eal-Encyclopddie der classischen Altertumswissenschaft, s.v. The time of Petosiris is tentatively dated in the second pre-Christian era (Pauly-Wissowa, s.v.).

As is known, Pallas of the Greeks was another name for Typhon; also Seth of the Egyptians was an equivalent of Typhon.12 Thus the number of references to the comet Typhon can be enlarged by references to Pallas and Seth. It was not only Abraham Rockenbach who s ynchronized the appearance of the comet Typhon with the Exodus of the Israelite s from Egypt. Looking for authors who might have done likewise, I found that Samuel Bochart, a scholarly writ er of the seventeenth century, in his book Hierozoicon,13 has a passage in which he maintain s that the plagues of the days of the Exodus resemble the calamities that Typhon brought in his tr ain, and that therefore \"the flight of Typhon is the Exodus of Moses from Egypt.\"14 In this he actually follows the passage transmitted by Plutarch.15 But since Typhon, according to Pliny a nd others, was a comet, Samuel Bochart was close to the conclusions at which we arrive, traveling along another route. The Spark A phenomenon of great significance took place. The head of the comet did not crash into the earth, but exchanged major electric al discharges with it. A trem endous spark sprang forth at the moment of the nearest approach of the comet, when the waters were heaped at their highest above the surface of the earth and before they fell down, followed by a rain of debris torn from the very body and tail of the comet. \"And the Angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, 12 \"The Egyptians regularly call Typhon 'Seth'; it means 'overmastering' and 'overpowering,' and in very many instances 'turning back,' and again ' overpassing'.\" Plutarch, Is is and Osiris (transl.

Artapanus, the author of the no longer extant De Judaeis, apparently knew that the words, \"The Lord looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud,\" refer to a great lightning. Eusebius quotes Ar tapanus: \"But when the Egyptians . . . were pursuing them, a fire, it is said, shone out upon them from the front, and the sea overflowed the path again, and the Egyptians were all destroyed by the fire and the flood.\" 2 The great discharges of interplanetary force are commemorated in th e traditions, legends, and mythology of all the peoples of the world. The god—Z eus of the Greeks, Odin of the Icelanders, Ukko of the Finns, Perun of the Russian pagans, Wotan (Woden) of the Germans, Mazda of the Persians, Marduk of the Babylonians, Shiva of the Hindus—is pictured with lightning in his hand and described as the god who threw his thu nderbolt at the world overwhelmed with water and fire. 1 Exodus 14 : 19 ff. 2 Eusebius, Preparation for the Gospel (tra nsl. Gifford), Bk. ix, Chap, xxvii. Calmet, Commentaire, VExode, p. 154, correctly understood the passage in Artapanus because he paraphrases it as follows: \"Artap anus dans Eusebe dit que les E gyptiens furent frappes de la foudre, et abbatus par le feu du ci el dans le meme temps que l'eau de la mer vint tomber sur eux.\" WORLDS IN COLLISION  ft ^Similarly, many psalms of the Scriptures comme morate the great discharges. \"Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the h ills moved and were shaken. . . .

His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and trembled.\"7 ^Nothing is easier than to add to the number of such quotatio ns from other parts of the Scriptures—Job, the Song of Deborah, the Prophets. With the fall of the double wall of water, the Egyptian host was swept away.

CHAPTER 4 Boiling Earth and Sea TWO CELESTIAL BODIES were driven near to each other. The interior of the terrestrial globe pushed toward the exterior, The earth, disturbed in its rotation, developed heat. The land surface became hot. Various sources of many peoples descri be the melting of the earth's surface and the boiling of the sea. The earth burst and lava flowed. The Me xican sacred book, Popol Vuh, the Manuscript Cakchiquel, the Manuscript Troano all record how the mountains in every part of the Western Hemisphere simultaneously gushed lava. The volcanoe s that opened along the entire chain of the Cordilleras and in other mountai n ranges and on flat land vomited fire, vapor, and torrents of lava. These and other Mexican sources relate ho w, at the closing hours of the age that was brought to an end by the rain of fire, mountains swelled under th e pressure of molten masses and new ridges rose; new volcanoes sprang out of the ear th, and streams of lava flowed out of the cleft earth.1 .-.Events underlying Greek and Mexican traditions ar e narrated in the Scriptures. \"The mountains shake with the swelling . . . the earth melted.\" 2 \"Clouds and darkness . . . fire . . . the earth saw and trembled.

The star Tistrya made the sea boil.7 The traditions of the Indians retain the memory of this boiling of the water in river and sea. The tribes of British Columbia tell: \"Great clouds appeared . . . such a great heat came, that finally the water boiled. People jumped into the streams and lakes to cool themselves, and died.\" 8 On the North Pacific coast of America the tribes insist that the ocean boiled: \"It grew very hot . . . many animals jumped into the water to save th emselves, but the water began to boil.\" 9 The Indians of the Southern Ute trib e in Colorado record in their legends that the rivers boiled.10 Jewish tradition, as preserved in the rabbinical sources, declares th at the mire at the bottom of the Sea of Passage was heated. \"T he Lord fought against the Egyp tians with the pillar of cloud and fire. The mire was heated to the boiling point by the pillar of fire.\" n The rabbinical sources say also that the pillar of fire and of smoke leveled mountains.12 Hesiod in his Theogony, relating the upheaval cause d by a celestial collis ion, says: \"The huge earth groaned. ...

The few survivors of the ruined world were enveloped in darkness, \"the sun in some way did not exist,\" and in intervals in the light of blazing fires they saw the silhouettes of new mountains. The Mayan sacred book Popol-Vuh says that the god \"rolled mountains\" and \"removed mountains,\" and \"great and small mountains move d and shaked.\" Mountains swelled with lava. Coniraya-Vira-cocha, the god of th e Incas raised mountains from th e flat land and flattened other mountains.14 > And similarly, \"When Israel went out of Egypt . . . the sea saw and fled . . . the mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like lambs. . . .

One of these volcanoes is usually described as th e Mount of the Lawgiving: In the seventies of the last century a scholar, Charles Beke, sugge sted that Mount Sinai was a volcano in the Arabian Desert.1 The Book of Deuteronomy (4:11) says \"the mountain burned with fire unto the robin-bobin"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and th ick darkness.\" Beke's idea was rejected by his contemporaries and ultimately by himself.2 Modern scholars, however, agree with his original theory, 14 Brasseur, Sources de Vhistoire primitive du Mexi que, pp. 30, 35, 37, 47. « Psalms 114 : 1-7.

Thus the claims of the rival peaks of the Sinai Peninsula for the honor of being the Mount of the Law-giving 3 are silenced by new contestants. 'It is true that it is stated \"the mountains melted . . . even that Sinai,\" * but this melting of summits does not necessarily mean an opening up of craters. Rocks turned into a flowing mass. The plateau of the Sinai Peninsula is covered with formations of basalt lava; 5 wide stretches of the Arabian Desert also gliste n with lava.6 Lava formations, interspersed with extinguished volcanoes, stretch from the vicinity of Palmyra s outhward into Arabia as far as Mecca.7 Only a few thousand years ago the deserts glowed w ith the beacons of many volcanoes, mountains melted, and lava flowed over the ground from numerous Assures. -The celestial body that the great Arch itect of nature sent close to the earth, made contact with it in electrical discharges, retreate d, and approached again. If we are to believe the Scriptural data, there elapsed seven weeks, or by another comput ation, about two months 8 from the day of the Exodus to the day of the re velation at Mount Sinai. **There were thunders and light nings, and a thick cloud upon th e mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people th at was in the camp trembled. . . . And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke . . . and the smok e thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.

This phenomenon was known to early geographers. Pliny * wrote that ea rthquakes are \"preceded or accompanied by a terrible sound.\" Vaults su pporting the ground give way and it seems as though the earth heaves deep sighs. The sound was attributed to the gods and called theophany. The eruptions of volcanoes are also accomp anied by loud noises. The sound produced by Krakatoa in the East Indies, dur ing the eruption of 1883, was so loud that it was heard as far as Japan, 3,000 miles away, the farthe st distance traveled by sound recorded in modern annals.2 •^Jn the days of the Exodus, when the world was shaken and rocked, 14 The Biblical Antiquities of Philo (transl.

An inspired leader interpreted the voice he heard, ten long, trumpetlike blasts. The earth groaned: for weeks now all its strata had been disarranged, its orbit distorte d, its world quarters displaced, its oceans thrown upon its continents, its seas turn ed into deserts, its mountains upheaved, its islands submerged, its rivers running upstream—a world flowing with lava, shattered by meteorites, with yawning chasms, burning naphtha, vomiting volcanoes, sh aking ground, a world enshrouded in an atmosphere filled with smoke and vapor. Twisting of strata and building of mountains, earthquakes and rumbling of volcanoes joined in an infernal din. It was a voice not only in the desert of Sinai; the entire wo rld must have heard it. \"The sky and the earth resounded . . . mountains and hills were moved,\" says the Midrash. \"Loud did the firmament roar, and earth with echo reso unded,\" says the epic of Gilgamesh.7 In Hesiod \"the huge earth groaned\" when Zeus lashed Typhon with his bolts —\"the earth resounded terribly, and the wide heaven above.\" 8 The approach of two charged globes toward each other could also produce trumpetlike sounds, varying as the distance between them increased or lessened.9 It appears that this phenomenon is described 3 Exodus 3 : 14. * Exodus 20 : 1. 5 Exodus 19 : 18-19. 6 Exodus 20 : 18; \"the thunderings and the lightnings\" of the King James Version is not an exact translation of Kolot and Lapidim. i Epic of Gilgamish (transl.

The great king-lawgiver of China, in whose time a dreadful cataclysm took place and the order of nature was disturbed, bore the name Yahou.17 In the Preface to the Shu King, attributed to Confucius, it is written: \"Examining into anti quity, we find that the Emperor Yaou was called Fang-heun.\" 18 Yahou was a surname given to him in the time following the flood, apparently inspired by the sound of the earth's groaning. The same sound was heard in those years in the Western Hemisphere or wherever the ancestors of the Indians then lived. They relate that once wh en the heavens were very close to the earth, all mankind lifted the sky little by litt le at the repeated shouting 'T ahu,\" which rang all over the world.19 In Indonesia an oath is accompanied by the invoca tion of the heavenly bodies.

But the fact that this catastrophe has been vivid in tr aditions for thousands of years, while neither the overflow of the Yellow River, when a million people perished, nor the great earthquakes, play a conspicuous part in the recoll ections of the nation, is an argument against the established interpretation. Rivers do not overflow in the form of a sky-hi gh wave. The overflowing rivers of China subside in a few weeks, and the water does not remain in the plains until the following spring, but flows away, and the ground dries in a few more weeks.

We are not told what caused the cataclysm, but it is written in anci ent annals that during the reign of Yahou \"a brilli ant star issued from the constellation Yin.\" 9 According to the old Tibetan traditions, the hi ghlands of Tibet, too, were flooded in a great cataclysm.10 The traditions of the Tibetans speak also of terrifying comets that caused great upheavals.11 Calculations were undertaken to establish the dates of the Em peror Yahou. On the basis of a remark that the constellation Niao, thought to be the constellation Hydra, culminated at sunset on the day of the vernal equinox in the time of Ya hou, it was reckoned that the flood occurred in the twenty-third century before the present era, but this date has been questioned by many. Sometimes it has also been supposed that the \"F lood of Yahou\" was the Chinese story of the universal flood, but this point of view has been abandoned. The stor y of the deluge of Noah has its parallel in a Chinese traditi on about a universal flood in prehis toric times, in th e days of Fo- hi, who alone of all the country was saved. Th e flood of Yahou is sometimes regarded as simultaneous with the flood of Ogyges. The flood of Ogyges did not occur in the thir d millennium, but in the middle of the second millennium before this era.

CHAPTER 5 East and West OUR PLANET rotates from west to east. Has it always done so? In this rotation from west to east, the sun is seen to rise in the east and set in the west. Was the east the primeval and only place of the sunrise? There is testimony from all parts of the world that the side which is now turned toward the evening once faced the morning. In the second book of his history, Herodotus relates his conversations with Egyptian priests on his visit to Egypt some time during the second half of the fifth century before the present era. Concluding the history of their people, the priests told him that the period following their first king covered three hundred and forty-one generations, and Herodotus calculated that, three generations being equal to a cen tury, the whole period was over eleven thousand years. The priests asserted that within hist orical ages and since Egypt became a kingdom, \"four times in this period (so they told me) the sun rose contrary to his wont; twice he rose where he now sets, and twice he set where he now rises.\" * This passage has been the subject of exhaustive commentaries, the authors of which tried to invent every possible explanati on of the phenomenon, but failed to consider the meaning which was plainly stated by the priests of Egypt, and their efforts thr ough the centuries have remained fruitless.

So thought Alexander von Humbol dt of \"the famous passage of the second book of Herodotus which so strained the sagacity of th e commentators.\" 3 But this is also a violation of the meaning of the words of the priests, for during the period of spi nning, orient and Occident do not exchange places. One may doubt the trustworthiness of the priests' statements, or of Egyptian tradition in general, or attack Herodotus for ignorance of the natural sciences,4 but th ere is no way to reconcile the passage with present-day natural science.

In the Erm itage Papyrus (Leningrad, 1116b recto) also, reference is made to a catastrophe that turned the 'land upside down; happens that which never (yet) had happened.\"10 It is assumed that at that time—in the second millennium—people were not aware of the daily rotation of the earth, and believed that the firmament with its luminaries turned around the earth; therefor e, the expression, \"the earth turn ed over,\" does not refer to the daily rotation of the globe. Nor do these descriptions in the papyri of Le iden and Leningrad leave room for a figurative explanation of the sentence, especially if we c onsider the text of the Papyrus Harris—the turning over of the earth is accompanied by the interchange of the south and north poles. Harakhte is the Egyptian name for the western sun. As there is but one sun in the sky, it is supposed that Harakhte means the sun at its setting. But why should the sun at its setting be regarded as a T Mela, differing from Herodotus , computed the length of Egyp tian history as equal to 330 generations until Amasis (died —525) and figured it at more than thirteen thousand years. 8 H.

Was there no autochthonous tradition in Greece a bout the reversals of th e revolution of the sun and stars?

Of all the changes wh ich take place in the heavens this reversal is the greatest and most complete.\"16 Plato continued his dialogue, using the above passage as the introdu ction to a fantastic philosophical essay on the revers al of time. This minimizes the value of the quoted passage despite the categorical form of his statement. The reversal of the movement of the sun in th e sky was not a peaceful event; it was an act of wrath and destruction. Plato wrote in Politicus: \"There is at that ti me great destruction of animals in general, and only a small part of the human race survives.\" The reversal of the movement of the sun was re ferred to by many Greek authors before and after Plato.

But it could not have been an eclipse. Strabo was mistaken when he tried to rationalize the story by saying that Atreus was an early astronomer who \"discovered that the sun revolves in a direction opposite to the movement of the heav ens.\" 19 During the night the stars move from east to west two minutes faster than the sun which moves in th e same direction during the day.20 Even in poetical language such a phenomenon woul d not have been described as follows: \"And the sun-car's winged speed from the ghastly stri fe turned back, changing his westering track robin-bobin"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"through the heavens unto where blush-burning dawn rose,\" as Euripides wrote in another work of his.21 Seneca knew more than his older contemporary Strabo.

Aristotle says that the Pythagoreans differed between the right- and the left-hand motion of the sky (\"the side from which the stars rise\" is heaven's right, \"and where they set . . . it s left\"23), and in Plato we find: \"A direction from left to right—and that will be from west to east.\"24 The present sun moves in the opposite direction.

The Reversed Polarity of the Earth A thunderbolt, on striking a magnet, reverses the poles of the magnet. The terrestrial globe is a huge magnet. A short circuit between it and anothe r celestial body could re sult in the north and south magnetic poles of the earth exchanging places. It is possible to detect in the geological records of the earth the orientation of the terrestrial magnetic field in past ages. \"When lava cools and freezes following a vol canic outburst, it takes up a permanent magnetization dependent upon the orientation of th e Earth's magnetic field at the time. This, because of small capacity for magnetization in the Earth's magnetic field after freezing, may remain practically constant. If this assumption be correct, the 41 Steinschneider, Hebraische Bibliographie, Vol. XVIII, pp. 61 ff. 42 Ginzberg, Legends, I, 69. 43 Taam Zekenim 55b, 58b. 44 Koran, Sura LV. 48 Steinschneider, Hebraische Bibliographie, Vol. XVIII.

Although rep eated heating of lava and rocks can change the picture, there must have remained rocks with inverted polarity. Another1 author writes: \"Examination of magnetization of some igneous ro cks reveals that they are polarized oppositely from the prevailing present direction of the local magnetic field and many of the older rocks are less strongly magnetized than more recent ones. On the assumption that the magnetization of the rocks occurred when the magma cooled and that th e rocks have held their present positions since that time, this would indicate that the polarity of the Earth has b een completely reversed within recent geological times.\" 2 Because the physical facts seemed entirely inc onsistent with every cosmological theory, the author of the above passage was cautious not to draw further conclusions from them. The reversed polarity of lava indicates that in recent geological times the magnetic poles of the globe were reversed; when they had a very di fferent orientation, abunda nt flows of lava took place. Additional problems, and of a large scope, are: whether the position of the magnetic poles has anything to do with the direc tion of rotation of the globe , and whether there is an interdependence in the direction of the magne tic poles of the sun and of the planets.

Was the cosmic catastrophe that terminated a wo rld age in the days of the fall of the Middle Kingdom and of the Exodus one of these occasions, and did the earth change the direction of its rotation at that time? If we cannot assert this much, we can at leas t maintain that the earth did not remain on the same orbit, nor did its poles stay in their places, nor was the direction of the axis the same as before. The position of the globe and its course were not settled when the earth first came into contact with the onrushing comet; in Pl ato's terms, already partly quoted, the motion of the earth was changed by \"blocking of th e course\" and went through \"shaking of the revolutions\" with \"disruptures of every possible kind,\" so that the position of the earth became \"at one time reversed, at anothe r oblique, and again upside dow n,\" and it wandered \"every way in all six directions.\" The Talmud and other ancient rabbi nical sources tell of great dist urbances in the solar movement at the time of the Exodus and the Passage of the Sea and the Lawgiving.1 In old Midrashim it is repeatedly narrated that four times the sun was forced out of its course in the few weeks between the day of the Exodus and the day of the Lawgiving.2 The prolonged darkness (and prolonged day in the Far East) and the earths hock (i.e., the ninth and the tenth plagues) and the worl d conflagration were the result of one of these disturbances in the motion of the earth.

Insolation was impaired by heavy clouds of dust, and the radiation of heat from the earth was equally hindered.1 Heat was generated by the earth's contacts with another ce lestial body; the earth was removed to an orbit farther from the sun; the polar regions were displaced; oceans and seas evaporated and the vapors precipitated as snow on new polar regions and in the higher lat itudes in a long Fimbul-winter and formed new ice sheets; the axis on which the ear th rotated pointed in a different direction, and the order of the seasons was disturbed. Spring follows winter and fall follows summer becau se the earth rotates on an axis inclined toward the plane of its revoluti on around the sun. Should this axis become perpendicular to that plane, there would be no seasons on the earth. S hould it change its direction, the seasons would change their intensity and their order. The Egyptian papyrus known as Papyrus Anastasi IV contains a complaint about gloom and the absence of solar light; it says al so: \"The winter is come as (ins tead of) summer, the months are reversed and the hours are disordered.\" 2 15 Hastings, \"Eschatology,\" Encycl opedia of Religion and Ethics. !« Olrik, Ragnarok. p. 406. if Revue des traditions populaires, XVII (1902-1903), 571. 1 Cf. the works of Arrhemus on the influen ce of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere on the temperature, and J.

There exists a direct statement found as a gloss on a manuscript of Timaeu s that a calendar of a solar year of three hundred and sixty days was introduced by the Hyksos after the fall of the Middle Kingdom; 16 the calendar year of the Middle Kingdom apparently had fewer days. ^The fact I hope to be able to estab lish is that from the fifteenth ce ntury to the eighth century before the present era the astronomical year was equal to 360 days; neither before the fifteenth century, nor after the eighth century was the year of this length. In a later chapter of this work extensive material will be presented to demonstrate this point. The number of days in a year during the Middl e Kingdom was less than 360; the earth then revolved on an orbit somewhat closer to the pres ent orbit of Venus. An investigation into the length of the astronomical year during the period s of the Old and Middle Kingdoms is reserved for that part of this work which will deal with the cosmic catas trophes that occurred before the beginning of the Midd le Kingdom of Egypt. ^.Here I give space to an old Midrashic source which, taking issue with a contradiction in the scriptural texts referring to the length of time th e Israelites sojourned in Egypt, maintains that \"God hastened the course of the pl anets during Israel's st ay in Egypt,\" so that the sun completed 400 revolutions during the space of 210 regular y ears.17 These figures must not be taken as correct, since the intention was to reconcile two biblical texts, but the reference to the different motion of the planets in the period of the Israe lites' stay in Egypt duri ng the Middle Kingdom is worth mentioning.

CHAPTER 6 The Shadow of Death AN ENTIRE YEAR after the eruption of Krakatoa in the East - Indies in 1883, sunset and sunrise in both hemispheres were very colorf ul. Lava dust suspended in the air and carried around the globe accounted for this phenomenon.1 In 1783, after the eruption of Sk aptar-Jokull in Iceland, the worl d was darkened for months; records of this phenomenon are found in many contemporary authors. One German contemporary compared the gloomy world of the year 1783 with the Egyptian plague of darkness.2 The world was gloomy in the year of Caesar's death, —44. \"After the murder of Caesar the dictator and during the Antonine war,\" there was \"almost a w hole year's continuous gloom,\" wrote Pliny.3 Virgil described this year in these words: \"The sun . . . veiled his shining face in dusky gloom, and godless age feared everlasting night. . . . Germany heard the clash of arms through all the sky; the Alps rock ed with unwonted terrors . . . and spectres, pale in wondrous wise, were seen at evening twilight.\" 4 On September 23, —44, a short while after the deat h of Caesar, on the very day when Octavian performed the rites in honor of the deceased, a comet became visible at daytime; it was very bright and 1 The Eruption of Krakatoa: Report, ed. by G.

It was seen for only a few days and vanished while still in the north.6 It appears that the gloom which enveloped the world the year af ter Caesar's death was caused by the dust of the comet dispersed in the atmosphe re. The \"clash of arms\" heard \"through all the sky\" was probably the sound that accompanied the entrance of the gases a nd dust into the earth's atmosphere. If the eruption of a single vol cano can darken the atmosphe re over the entire globe, a simultaneous and prolonged eruption of thousands of volcanoes would blacken the sky. And if the dust of the comet of —44 had a darkening eff ect, contact of the earth with a great cinder- trailing comet of the fifteenth century before this era could likewise cause the blackening of the sky. As this comet activated all the volcanoes an d created new ones, the cumulative action of the eruptions and of the comet's dust must have saturated the atmosphere with floating particles. Volcanoes vomit water vapor as we ll as cinders. The heating effect of the contact of the globe with the comet must have caused a great evapor ation from the surface of the seas and rivers. Two kinds of clouds—water vapor and dust—were formed. The clouds obscured the sky, and drifting very low, hung as a fog. The veil left by the gaseous trai l of the hostile star and the smoke of the volcanoes caused da rkness, not complete, but pr ofound. This condition prevailed for decades, and only very gradually did the dust subside and the wa ter vapors condense. \"A vast night reigned ov er all the American land, of which tradition speaks unanimously: in a sense the sun no longer existed fo r this ruined world which was lighted up at intervals only by robin-bobin"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"frightful conflagrations, revealing the full horror of their situation to the small number of human beings that had escaped from these calamities.\" 6 \"Following the cataclysm caused by the waters, the author of the 6 Dio Cassius, Roman Histor y, xlv. 7; Pliny ii. 71. 93; Suetonius Caesar 88; Plutarch Caesar 69. 3.

What could it be, this heavenly bread, which served also as a veil for a goddess-planet, and was used as an ointment, too? It was honey, said some schol ars. But honey is a regular food for mortals, whereas ambrosia was given only to the generation of heroes. \"Then what was this substance that served as fodder on the ground for horses, as a veil for planets, bread from the sky for heroes, and that also turned fluid for their drink, and was oil and perfume for ointments? •It was the manna that was baked into bread, had an oily taste and also a honey taste, was found on the ground by man and beast, wrapped the earth and the heavenly bodies in a veil, was called \"corn of heaven\" and \"bread of the mighty,\"1T ha d a fragrant odor, and served the women in the wilderness as ointment.18 Manna, like ambrosia , was compared with honey and with morning dew. The belief of Aristotle and other writers19 that honey falls from the atmosphere with the dew was based on the experience of those days when the world was veiled in the carbon clouds that precipitated honey-frost. These clouds are described as \"dreaded shades\" in the Kalevala. From these \"dreaded shades,\" says the epos, honey dropped. \"And the clouds their fragrance sifted, sifted honey . . . from their home within the heavens.\" 20 The Maoris in the Pacific, the Jews on the bor der of Asia and Africa, the Hindus, the Finns, the Icelanders, all describe the honey-food being dr opped from the clouds, dreary shades of the shadow of death, that enveloped the earth after a cosm ic catastrophe. All traditions agree also that the source of the heavenly bread falling from the clouds with the morning dew was a celestial body.

Phaethon The Greeks as well as the Carians and other people s on the shores of the Aegean Sea told of a time when the sun was driven off its course and disappeared for an entire day, and the earth was burned and drowned. The Greek legend says that the young Phaethon, who claimed parentage of the sun, on that fatal day tried to drive the chariot of the sun. Phaet hon was unable to make his way \"against the whirling poles,\" and \"their swift axis\" swept him away. Phaethon in Greek means \"the blazing one.\" Many authors have dealt with the story of Phaet hon; the best known versi on is a creation of the Latin poet Ovid. The chariot of the sun, driv en by Phaethon, moved \"no longer in the same course as before.\" The horses \"break loose from their course\" and \"rush aimlessly, knocking against the stars set deep in the sky and snatching the chario t along through uncharted ways.\" The constellations of the cold B ears tried to plunge into the forb idden sea, and the sun's chariot roamed through unknown regions of the air. It was \" borne along just as a ship driven before the headlong blast, whose pilot has let the useless rudder go and aba ndoned the ship to the gods and prayers.\" 1 \"The earth bursts into flame, the highest parts first, and splits into deep cr acks, and its moisture is all dried up.

He discovered that \"neith er he himself nor any other Gr eek knew any thing at all, one might say, about such matters.\" Solon unfolded befo re tha priests the tale of the deluge, the only ancient tradition he was aware of. One of the priests, an old man,4 said: \"There have been and there will be many and divers destructions of mankind, of which the greatest are by fire and water, and lesser ones by countless other means.

Now in this island of Atlantis there existed a confederation of kings, a great and marvelous power, which held sway ov er all the island, and ov er many other islands also and parts of the continent; and, moreover, of the lands here within th e Straits they ruled over Libya as far as Egypt, and over Europe as far as Tuscany.\" 4 In the nineteenth century ships sailed the Atlantic Ocean to explore its bed in search of Atlantis, and before the Second World War scientific soci eties existed for the sole purpose of exploring the problem of the sunken island. Much speculation was offered, not only on the wher eabouts of Atlantis, but also on the cultural achievements of its inhabitants. Plato, in another wo rk of his (Critias), wrote a political treatise, and, as no real place in the world could have be en the scene of his utopia, he chose for that purpose the sunken island. Modern scholars, find ing some affinity between American, Egyptian, and Phoenician cultures, think that Atlantis may have been the intermediary link. There is much probability in these speculations; if they are justified, Crete, a maritime base of Carian navigators, may disclose some information about Atlantis as soon as the Cretan scripts are satisfactorily deciphered. One point in Plato's story about the submersion of Atlantis requires corr ection. Plato said that Solon told the story to Critias the elder, and that the young Critias, Plato's friend, heard it from his grandfather when he was a ten-year-old boy. Critias the younger remembered having been told that the catastrophe which befell Atlantis happened 9,000 years before. There is one zero too many here. We do not know of any vestiges of hu man culture, aside from that of the Neolithic age, nor of any navigating nation, 9,000 years before Solon. Numbers we hear in childhood easily grow in our memory, as do dimensions. When revisiting our childhood home, we are surprised at the smallness of the rooms—we had remembered them as much larger. Whatever the source of the error, the most pr obable date of the sinking of Atlantis would be in the middle of the second millennium, 900 years before Sol on, when the earth twice suffered great * Plato Timaeus 24 E-25 B. 148  WORLDS IN COLLISION catastrophes as a result of \"the sh ifting of the heavenly bodies.\" These words of Plato received the least attention, though th ey deserved the greatest. The destruction of Atlantis is de scribed by Plato as he heard it from his source: \"At a later time there occurred portentous earthquakes and floods , and one grievous day and night bef ell them, when the whole body of your [Greek] warriors was swallowed up by the earth, and the island of Atlantis in like manner was swallowed up by the sea and vanished; wherefore also the ocean at robin-bobin"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"that spot has now become impassable and unsea rchable, being blocked up by the shoal mud which the island created as it settled down.\" 5 At the time when Atlantis perished in the ocean, the people of Greece were destroyed: the catastrophe was ubiquitous. As if recalling what had happened, the Psalmist wrote: \"Destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities, their memori al is perished with th em.\" 6 He prayed also: \"God is our refuge and strength . . . therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea; though the waters thereof roar and be troubled.\" T The Floods of Deucalion and Ogyges The history of Greece knows two gr eat natural catastrophes: the floods of Deucalion and of Ogyges. One of them, usually that of Deucalion, is described by Greek authors as having been simultaneous with the conflagration of Phaethon. The floods of Deucalion and Ogyges brought overwhelming destruction to the mainland of Greece and to the islands around and caused changes in the geographical profile of the area. That of Deucalion was most devastating: water covered the land and annihilated the population. According to the legend, only two persons— Deucalion and his wife—remained alive. This last detail must not be taken more literally than similar statements found in descriptions of gr eat catastrophes all around the world; for example, two daughters of Lot, who hid with him in a cave « Plato Timaeus 25 C-D. « Psal ms 9:6. » Psalms 46 : 1-3. WORLDS IN COLLISION  149 after the catastrophe of Sodom a nd Gomorrah, believed that they a nd their father were the only survivors in the land.1 ^*\" The chronologists among the Fathers of the Church found material for assuming that one of the two catastrophes, the flood of Deucalion or that of Ogyges, had been contemporaneous with the Exodus. Julius Africanus wrote: \"We affirm that Ogygus [Ogyges] from whom the first flood [in Attica] derived its name, and who was saved when many perished, lived at the time of the Exodus of the people from Egypt along with Moses.\" 2 He further expressed his belief in the coincidence of the catastrophe of Ogyges and the one that occurred in Egypt in the days of the Exodus in the following words: J^\"The Passover and the Exodus of the Hebrews from Egypt took place, and also in Attica the flood of Ogygus. And that is ac cording to reason. For when the Egyptians were being smitten in the anger of God with hail and storms, it was only to be expected that certain parts of the earth should suffer with them.\" s ^Eusebius placed the Flood of Deucalion and th e conflagration of Phaethon in the fifty-second year of Moses' life.4 Augustine also synchroni zed the Flood of Deucalio n with the time of Moses; 5 he assumed that the Flood of Ogyges took place earlier. .-^ A chronologist of the seventh century (Isidore, bishop of Seville) * dated the Flood of Deucalion in the time of Moses; chronologists of the seventeenth century likewise calculated that the Flood of Deucalion took place in the time of Moses, close to but not simultaneous with the Exodus.7 It would seem to be more probable that, if the catastrophes oc- 1 Genesis 19 : 31. 2 Julius Africanus in The Ante-Nicene Fathers, ed.

In the words of Pl ato, who quoted the Egyptian priest speaking to Solon, the catastrophes must have escaped the no tice of the future generations because, as a result of the devastation, \"for many generations the survivors died with no power to express themselves in writing.\" The memory of the catas trophe of Ogyges would have vanished in the catastrophe of Deucalion if Ogyges had preceded Deucalion.8 Apparently, the truth is with those who placed the catastrophe of Deucalion in the days of Exodus; but those who reckoned that Ogyges was a contemporary of Moses were also correct, except that Moses did not live until the Flood of Ogyges—it took place in the days of Joshua. In commemoration of the Deucalion flood, the peopl e of Athens observed a feast in the month of Anthesterion, which is a spring month; the feast wa s called Anthesteria. On the thirteenth of the month, the main day of the feast, honey and flour were poured into a fissure in the earth as a sacrifice.9 The date of this ceremony—the thirteenth day of Anthesterion in the spring—is revealing if we remember what was said in the section entitled \"1 3.\" It was on the thirteenth day of the spring month (Aviv) that the great planetary contact occurred which preceded by a few hours the Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt. The offering of honey and flour as the main cer emony of the feast is al so revealing if we recollect that manna, or heavenly corn, tasting like honey, fell on the earth after the contact of the earth with a celestial body. As to the provenance of the name Deucalion, scholars admit that 8 But cf. Frazer, \"Ancient Stories of a Great Flood,\" Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, XLVI (1916). However, Eusebi us placed Deucalion before Ogyges. 9 Cf. Pausanias, Description of Greece, I, xvi ii, 7. Pauly-Wissowa, ReaU Encyclo-padie, s. v. \"Anthesterion\"; also Andr ee, Die Flutsagen, p. 41. WORLDS IN COLLISION  151 it is not known.10 For the name an d the person of Ogyges we have some concrete information. Although Ogyges was a king, the Greek annalists who wrote of the \"flood of Ogyges\" as one of the outstanding events of the past of their count ry, at the same time did not know anything about a king of that name in Greece.11 Who was Ogyges? > We can solve this problem. When the Israelites under Moses a pproached the border of Moab, Balaam in his blessing of Israel used these word s: \"His king shall be higher than Agag [Agog].\" 12 Agog must have been the most important king of that time in the area around the eastern Mediterranean. In my reconstruction of ancient history, I sha ll put forward proofs that the Amalekite king, Agog I, was identical with the Hyksos king whose name the Egyptologists tentatively read Apop I, and who, a few decades after the invasion of Egypt by the Amu (Hyksos), laid the foundation of Thebes, the future capital of the New Kingdom in Egypt. In conformity with this assertion, I can point to the fact that Greek tradition, which does not know of any activities of King Ogyges in Attica, occasionally places the domicile of Ogyges in Egyptian Thebes, and Aeschylus calls Thebes of E gypt \"the Ogygian Thebes,\" to differentiate it from the Greek Thebes in Boeotia. Ogyges is also credited with founding Thebes in Egypt.13 ¦^Agog was a contemporary of the aging Moses; he was a ruler who, in his time, had no equal in the region bordering the eastern Medi- 10 \"While the meaning of the legend is clear, th e meaning of the name Deucalion is enigmatic.\" Roscher, \"Deukalion,\" Lexikon d. griech. und romisch.

The assertion of Solinus, the author of Polyhi stor, that the flood of Ogyges was followed by a night of nine months' duration does not necessari ly signify a confusion with the darkness that ensued after the cataclysm of th e Exodus; as the causes were similar, similar results must have followed. The eruption of thousands of volcanoes would suffice to produce this darkness, of a shorter duration than that which fo llowed the cataclysm of the Exodus.15 Thus, the Greek traditions of the floods of Ogyges and Deucalion contain elements which, though interchanged, can be traced to two gr eat upheavals in the middle of the second millennium before the present era.16 14 The rabbinical sources say that Amalek went to conquer \"the entire world.\" Seals of the Hyksos kings were found on Crete, in Palestine, in Mesopotamia, and in other places outside Egypt. 15 Cf.

CHAPTER 8 The Fifty-two Year Period THE WORKS of Fernando de Alva Ixtlilxochitl, the early Mexican scholar (circa 1568-1648) who was able to read old Mexican texts, pres erve the ancient traditi on according to which the multiple of fifty-two-year periods played an important role in the recurrence of world catastrophes.1 He asserts also that only fifty-two years elapsed between two great catastrophes, each of which terminated a world age. s I have already pointed out, the Israelite tradition counts forty ye ars of wandering in the desert; between the time when the Israelite s left the desert and started th e difficult task of the conquest, and the time of the battle at Beth-horon twel ve years may well have passed. The conquest of Canaan took fourteen years, a nd the entire duration of Joshua's leadership amounted to twenty- eight years.2 ¦ -Now there exists a remarkable fact: the natives of pre-Columbian Mexico expected a new catastrophe at the end of every period of 1 Ixtlilxochitl, Obras historicas (ed. 1891-1892 in 2 vols.).

A ccording to the law, one could not convey his land for ever; the deed of sa le was but a lease for whatever number of years remained until the jubilee year. The year was pr oclaimed by the blowing of horns on the Day of Atonement. \"In the Day of Atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land. And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and pr oclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubilee unto you, and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.\" 1 Ever since, exegetes have labored over the bib lical statement that the jubilee year was to be observed every fiftieth year. The seventh sabbatical year is the forty-ninth year: \"And the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee fo rty and nine years. . . . And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year.\" 2 To leave the land fallow for two consecutive years was too great a demand and cannot be explained by the need of the soil under cu ltivation for rest. The festival of the jubilee, with the return of land to its original owners a nd the release of slaves, bears the character of an atonement, and its proclamation on the Day of At onement emphasizes this still further. Was there any special reason why fear returned every fifty years? The jubilee of the Mayas must have had a genesis similar to that of the jubilee of the Israelites. The difference lies in the human character of the festival of the Jews and its inhuman char acter among the Mayas; but with both peoples it was a year of atonement, repeating itself every fiftieth year in the one case and every fifty-second year in the other. Comets do not return at exact periods because of perturbations caused by larger planets.3 The Mayas expected the return of a catastrophe every fifty-second year because that was the interval between two cataclysms that had ta ken place.

But what ha d Venus to do with the jubilee and the atonement? The Birth of Venus A planet turns and revolves on a quite circular orbit around a greater body, the sun; it makes contact with another body, a comet, that travels on a stretched out ellipse. The planet slips from its axis, runs in disorder off its orbit, wanders rather erratically, and in the end is freed from the embrace of the comet. The body on the long ellipse experiences similar dist urbances. Drawn off its path, it glides to some new orbit; its long train of gaseous substanc es and stones is torn away by the sun or by the planet, or runs away and revolve s as a smaller comet along its own ?Leviticus 16 : 8-26.

Since it was the same comet that on both occasions made contact with the earth, and at each of the contacts the comet changed its own orbit, the relevant question is not, \"On which occasion did the comet change its orbit?\" but first of all, \"Which comet changed to a planet?\" or \"Which planet was a comet in historical times?\" The transformation of the comet into a planet began on contact with the earth in the middle of the second millennium before the present era and was carried a step further one jubilee period later. \"After the dramatic events of the time of Exodus, the earth was shrouded in dense clouds for decades, and observation of star s was not possible; afte r the second contact, Venus, the new and splendid member of the solar family, was seen moving along its orbit.

In The City of God by Augustine it is written: \"From the book of Marcus Varro, entitled Of the R ace of the Roman People, I cite word for word the following instance: 'There occurred a remarkable celestial portent; for Castor records that in the brilliant star Venus, called Vesperugo by Plautus, and the lovely Hesperus by Homer, there occurred so strange a prodigy, that it changed it s color, size, form, course, which never happened before nor since.

But we read in the divine books that even the sun itself st ood still when a holy man, Joshua the son of Nun, had begged this from God.\" Augustine had no inkling that Castor, as quoted by Varro, and the Book of Jasher, as quoted in the Book of Joshua, refer to the same occurrence.

But a pparently the author of the treatises on geometry, optics, and astronomy, no longer extant, knew more about Venus than his critics think. From quotations which have survived in other authors, we know that Democritus built a theory of the creation and destruction of worl ds which sounds like the modern planetesimal theory without its shortcomings. He wrote: \"The worlds are unequally distributed in space; here there are more, there fewer; some ar e waxing, some are in their prime, some waning: coming into being in one part of the universe , ceasing in another part. The cause of their perishing is collision with one another.\" 2 He knew that \"the planets are at unequal distances from us\" and that there are more planets than we are able to discover with our eyes.3 Aristotle quoted the opinion of Democritus: \"Stars have been seen when comets dissolve.\"4 Among the early Greek scholars, Pythagoras of th e sixth century is generally credited with having had access to some secret science. His pupils, and their pupils, the so-called Pythagoreans, were cautious not to disclose their science to anyone who did not belong to their circle. Aristotle wrote of their interpretation of the nature of comets: \"Some of the Italians called Pythagoreans say that the comet is one of the planet s, but that it appears at great intervals of time and only rises a little above the horizon. This is the case with Mercury too; because it only rises a little above the horizon it often fails to be seen and consequently appears at great intervals of time.\" 5 This is a confused presentation of a theory; but it is possible to trace the truth in the Pythagorean teaching, which was not understood by Aristotle. A comet is a planet which returns at long intervals. One of the planets, wh ich rises only a little above th e horizon, was still regarded by the Pythagoreans of the fourth centu ry as a comet.

And all of them are often visible above the horizon together at th e same time. Further, comets are often found to appear, as well when all the planets are visible as when some are not.\"6 With these words, Aristotle, who did not learn the secrets of the Pythagoreans directly, tried to refute their teaching by arguing that all five planet s are in their places when a comet appears, as if the Pythagoreans thought that al l comets were one and the same pl anet leaving its usual path at certain times. But the Pythagoreans did not th ink that one planet represents all comets. According to Plutarch,7 they taught that each of the comets has its own orbit and period of revolution. Hence the Pythagoreans apparently knew that the comet which is \"one of the planets\" is Venus. The Comet Venus During the centuries when Venus was a comet, it had a tail. The early traditions of the peoples of Mexico, written down in pr e-Columbian days, relate that Venus smoked. \"The star that smoked, la estrella que humeava, was Sitlae choloha, which the Spaniards call Venus.\"1 \"Now, I ask,\" says Alexander Humboldt, \"what optic al illusion could give Venus the appearance of a star throwing out smoke?\"2 Sahagun, the sixteenth century Span ish authority on Mexico, wrote «Ibid. 7 Plutarch, \"Les Opinions des philosopher, \" in QZuvres de Plutarque (transl.

It is also said in the Vedas that the star Venus looks like fire with smoke .4 Apparently, the star had a tail, dark in the daytime and luminous at night. In very concrete form this luminous tail, which Venus had in earlier centuries, is menti oned in the Talmud, in the Tractate Shabbat: \"Fire is hanging down from the planet Venus.\" 5 This phenomenon was described by the Chaldeans. Th e planet Venus \"was said to have a beard.\" 6 This same technical expression (\"beard\") is used in modern astronomy in the description of comets. These parallels in observations made in the valle y of the Ganges, on the shores of the Euphrates, and on the coast of the Mexican Gulf prove thei r objectivity. The question must then be put, not in the form, What was the illusion of the an cient Toltecs and Maya s? but, What was the phenomenon and what was its cause? A train, larg e enough to be visible from the earth and giving the impression of smoke and fire, hung from the planet Venus. Venus, with its glowing train, was a very brilli ant body; it is therefore not strange that the Chaldeans described it as a \"bright torch of h eaven,\" 7 also as a \"diamond that illuminates like the sun,\" and compared its light with the light of the rising sun.8 At present, the light of Venus is less than one millionth of the light of the sun. \"A stupendous prodigy in the sky,\" the Chaldeans called it.9 vThe Hebrews similarly describe d the planet: \"The brilliant light of 3 Sahagun, Historia general de las cosas de Nueva Espana, Bk.

The mythologies of all peoples concer n themselves with the birth only of Venus, not with that of Jupiter, Mars, or Sa turn. Jupiter is described as heir to Saturn, but his birth is not a mythological subject. Horus of the Egyptians and Vishnu, born of Shiva, of the Hindus, were such newborn deities. Horus bat tled in the sky with the monster-serpent Seth; so did Vishnu. In Greece the goddess who suddenly appeared in the sky was Pallas Athene. She sprang from the head of Zeus-Jupiter. In another legend she wa s the daughter of a monster, Pallas-Typhon, who attacked her and whom she battled and killed. The slaying of the monster by a planet-god is the way in wh ich the peoples perceived the convulsion of the pillar of smoke when the earth and the comet Venus disturbed each other in their orbits, and the head of the comet and its ta il leaped against each other in violent electrical discharges. robin-bobin"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"The birth of the planet Athene is sung in the Homeric hymn dedicated to her, \"the glorious goddess, virgin, Tritogeneia.\" When she was bor n, the vault of the sky—the great Olympus— \"began to reel horribly,\" \"earth round about cried fearfully,\" \"t he sea was moved and tossed with dark waves, while foam burst forth suddenly,\" and 168 WORLDS IN COLLISION  169 the sun stopped for \"a long while.\" x The Greek te xt speaks of \"purple waves\"2 and of \"the sea [that] rises up like a wall,\" a nd the sun stopping in its course.3 Aristocles said that Zeus hid the unborn Athene in a cloud and then split it open with lightning,4 which is the mythological way to describe the appearance of a cel estial body from the pillar of cloud. Athene, or Latin Minerva, is called Tritogeneia (or Tritonia) after the lake Triton.5 This lake disappeared in a catastrophe in Africa when it br oke into the ocean, leavi ng the desert of Sahara behind it, a catastrophe connected with the birth of Athene. Diodorus,6 referring to undisclose d older authorities, says that Lake Triton in Africa \"disappeared from sight in the course of an ear thquake, when those parts of it which lay toward the ocean were torn asunder.\" This account implies that a great lake or ma rsh in Africa, separated from the Atlantic Ocean by a mountainous barrier, disappeared when the barrier was broken or lowered in a catastrophe.

The bull and the cow, the goat and the serpent, were animals dedicated to Athene. \"The goat being usually tabooed but chosen as an exception al victim for her,\" the animal was annually sacrificed on the Acropolis of Athens.22 With the Israelites the goat wa s the victim for Azazel, or Lucifer. 18 \"The usage of the Egyptians is also similar: they often call Isis by the name of Athena, which expresses some such meaning as 'I came from myself,' and is indication of self-originated movement.\" Manetho, cited by Plutarch, Isis a nd Osiris (transl.

Some ancient mythological sour ces point to Venus, other sources point to Jupiter. In one group of legends Jupiter (Zeus) is the protagonist of the drama: he leaves his place in the sky, rushes to battle Typhon, and st rikes him with thunderbolts. But other legends and historical sources, too, which I have quoted on previous pages in dicate that it was the planet Venus, or Pallas Athene of the Greeks. Athene killed her father, Typhon- Pallas, the celestial mon- 23 Langdon, Babylonian Menologies and the Semitic Calendars (1935), pp. 86-87.

Under the weight of many arguments, I came to the conclusion— about which I no longer have any doubt—that it was the planet Venus, at the time still a comet, that caused the catastrophe of the days of Exodus. Then why do a part of th e legends tie up this event with Jupiter? The cause of this duality in the mythological handling of an histori cal event lies in the fact that the ancients themselves did not know for certain which of the planets had caused the destruction. Some saw the pillar of cloud—Typhon defeated by Jup iter, the ball of fire that emerged from the pillar and battled with it. Others interprete d the globe as a body different from Jupiter. The Greek authors described the birth of Athene (planet Venus), saying she sprang from the head of Jupiter. \"And mighty Olympus trembled fearfully . . . and the earth around shrieked fearfully, and the sea was stirred, troubled wi th its purple waves.\"x One or two authors thought that Athene was born of Cronus. But the consensus of ancient authors makes Athene-Venus the offspring of Jupiter: she sprang from his head, and this bi rth was accompanied by great disturbances in the celestial and terrestrial spheres. Th e comet rushed toward the earth, and it could not be very well distinguished whether the planet Jupiter or its offspring was approaching. I may divulge here something that belongs to the second book of this work; namely, that at an earlier time, Jupiter had already caused havoc in the planetary fam ily, the earth included, a nd it was therefore only natural to see in the approach ing body the planet Jupiter. I referred in the introductory part of this work to the modern theory which ascribes the birth of the terrestrial planets to the pro cess of expulsion by larger ones. Th is appears to be true in the case of Venus. The other modern theory, which ascr ibes the origin of comets of short period to expulsion by large planets, is al so correct: Venus was expelled as a com et and then changed to a planet after contact with a number of members of the solar system. 1 \"The Homeric Hymn to Minerva\" (transl.

St. Jerome apparently had this image in view when he interpreted the star mentioned by Amos as Lucifer. Or was it the \"star of David,\" the six-pointed star?

The fact that Moses made an image—in violation of the seco nd commandment of the Decalogue—is not necessarily inconsistent with his being monotheist: there are many churches today where symbolic and even human figures are deified by people who profess to be monotheists. But as time passed, the presence of the serpent of Moses in the Temple of Jerusalem became so objectionable to the spirit of the prophets that in the days of Isaiah the serpent was broken into pieces. Even though its or iginal purpose may have been curative, it being the image of the angel who was sent in the pillar of fire and cloud to save the people of Israel from slavery, the brazen serpent with th e lapse of time became an object of worship. 8 II Kings 18 : 4.

Isis, the planet Venus,3 was repr esented as a human figure with two horns, like Astarte (Ishtar) of the horns; and sometimes it was fashioned in th e likeness of a cow. In time, Ishtar changed from male to female, and in many places worship of the bull changed to worship of the cow. The main reason for this seems to have been the fall of manna which turned the rivers into streams of honey and milk. A horned planet that produced m ilk most closely resembled a cow. In the Hymns of the Aiharva-Veda, in which the ambrosia that falls from the sky is glorified, the god is exalted as the \"great cow\" which \"drips with streams of milk\" and as \"a bull\" that \"hurlest thy fire upon earth and heaven.\"4 A passage of the Ra mayana about the \"celes tial cow\" says: \"Honey she gave, and roasted grain . . . and curled milk, and soup in lakes with sugared milk,\"5 which is the Hindu version of \"rivers of milk and honey.\" The \"celestial cow\" or \"the heavenly Surabhi\" (\"th e fragrant\") was the dau ghter of the Creator: she \"sprung from his mouth\"; at the same time nectar and \"excellent perfume\" were spread, according to the Indian epic.6 This description of the birth of the daughter from the mouth of the Creator is a Hindu parallel of At hene springing from the head of Zeus.

And noxious creatures were diffused by him over the earth, biting and venomous, such as the snake, scorpion, frog, and lizard, so that not so much as the point of a needle remained free from noxious creatures.\" * Then the Bundahis proceeds: \"The planets, wi th many demons [comets], dashed against the celestial sphere, and they mixed the constellations ; and the whole creation was as disfigured as though fire disfigured every pl ace and smoke arose over it.\" similar plague of vermin is described in the Scri ptures, in Exodus, Chapters 8 to 10, and also in Psalm 78 where it is told that there were sent \"divers sorts of flies am ong them [the people of Egypt], which devoured them; and frogs, which de stroyed them.\" Their labor was given to the caterpillar and the locust. \"The dust of the land became lice th roughout all the land of Egypt.\"2 \"And there came a grievous swarm of flies . . . in to all the land of Egypt.\" 3 The second, third, fourth, and eighth plagues were caused by vermin.

It is significant that all around the world peoples have associated the planet Venus with flies. In Ekron, in the land of the Philistines, there was erected a magnificent temple to Baal Zevuv, the god of the fly. In the ninth century King Ahazi ah of Jezreel, after he was injured in an accident, sent his emissaries to ask advice of this god at Ekron and not of the oracle at Jerusalem.9 This Baal Zevuv is Beelzebub of the Gospels.10 Ahriman, the god of darkness who battled with Or muzd, the god of light, is compared in the Bundahis to a fly. Of the flies th at filled the earth buried in gl oom it is said: \"His multitudes of flies scatter themselves over the world th at is poisoned through and through.\" u Ares (Mars) in the Iliad calls Athene \"dog-fly.\" \"The gods cl ashed with a mighty din, and the wide earth rang, and round about great heaven pe aled as with a trumpet.\" And Ares spoke to Athene: \"Wherefore now again, thou dog-fly, art making gods to clash with gods in strife?\" 12 The people of Bororo in central Brazil call the planet Venus \"the sand fly,\" 13 an appellation similar to that which Homer used for Athene. The Bantu tribes of central Africa relate that the \"sand fly brought fire from the sky,\" 14 which appear s to be a reference to the Promethean role of Beelzebub, the planet Venus.

These natives called the tail of such a star ci tlalin tlamina, exhalation of the come t; or, literally, 'the star shoots a dart.'

Hence, th e idea of the arrival of living organisms from interplanetary spaces is not new. Whether th ere is truth in this supposition of larval contamination of the earth is anyone's guess. The ability of many small insects and their larvae to endure great cold and heat and to live in an at mosphere devoid of oxygen renders not entirely improbable the hypothesis that Venus (and also Jupiter, from which Venus sprang) may be populated by vermin. Venus in the Folklore of the Indians Primitive peoples often are bound by inflexible cust oms and beliefs that date back hundreds of generations. The traditions of many primitive races speak of a \"lower sky\" in the past, a 'larger sun,\" a swifter movement of the sun across the fi rmament, a shorter day that became longer after the sun was arrested on its path. World conflagration is a frequent motif in folklo re. According to the Indians of the Pacific coast of North America the \"shooting star\" and the \"fir e drill\" set the world aflame. In the burning world one \"could see nothing but waves of fl ames; rocks were burning, the ground was burning, everything was burning.

A boy child was born to her. \"He told his people that he would go in the direction of the east, and he was to become the Morning Star.\" This tale sounds like an incoherent story, but let us note its various elements: \"something in the north that looked like clouds\" which made peopl e and animals huddle together in apprehension of an approaching catastrophe; wild beasts emerging from the forests and coming to human abodes; an engulfing tide that de stroyed everything, even the mons ter animals; the determination of the new four quarters of the horizon; a ge neration later the birth of the Morning Star. This combination of elements cannot be accidental; all these 2G. A. Dorsey, The Mythology of the Wichita (1904).

The Indians of the Chewkee trib e on the Gulf Coast tell: \"It wa s too hot. The sun was put 'a handbreadth' higher in the air, bu t it was still too hot. Seven tim es the sun was lifted higher and higher under the sky arch, until it became cooler.\" 3 In eastern Africa we can trace the same tradition. \"In very old times the sky was very close to the earth.\" 4 The Kaska tribe in the interior of British Columbia relate: \"O nce a long time ago the sky was very close to the earth.\" s The sky was pushed up and the weather changed. The sun, after being stopped on its way across th e firmament, \"became small, and small it has remained since then.\" • Here is a story, told to She lton by the Snohomish tribe on Puget Sound, about the origin of the exclamation \"Yahu,\" 7 to which I have already referred briefly. \"A long time ago, when all the animals were still human beings, the sky was very low. It was so low that the people could not stand erect. . . . They called a meeting together and discussed how they could raise the sky. But they were at a loss to know how to do so. No one was strong enough to lift the sky. Finally the idea occurred to them that possibly the sky mi ght be moved by the combined efforts of the people, if all of them pushed against it at the same time. But then the question arose of how it would be possible to make all the people exert th eir efforts at exactly the same moment. For the different peoples would be far away from one anot her, some would be in this part of the world, others in another part. What signa l could be given that all people would lift at precisely the same time? Finally, the word 'Yahu!' was invented for this purpose. It was deci ded that all the people should shout Tahu!' 3 Alexander, North American Mythology, p. 60. 4 L. Frobenius, Dichten und Denken in Sudan (1925). 5 J. A.

They repe ated this until the sky was suffi ciently high.\" Shelton says that the word \"Yahu\" is used today when some heavy object like a large canoe is being lifted. It is easy to recognize th e origin of this legend. Clouds of dus t and gases enveloped the earth for a long time; it seemed that the sky had descended low. The earth groaned repeatedly because of the severe twisting and dislocati on it had experienced. Only slowly and gradually did the clouds lift themselves from the ground. The clouds that enveloped the Israe lites in the desert, the trumpetl ike sounds that they heard at Mount Sinai, and the gradual lif ting of the clouds in the years of the Shadow of Death are the same elements that we find in this Indian legend. Because the same elements can be recognized in very different set tings, we can affirm that there was no borrowing from one people by another. A common experience created the stories, so dissimilar at first, and so much alike on second thought. The story of the end of the world, as related by th e Pawnee Indians, has an important content. It was written down8 from the mouth of an old Indian: \"We are told by the old people that the Morni ng Star ruled over all the minor gods in the heavens. . . . The old people told us that the Mo rning Star said that when the time came for the world to end, the Moon would turn red . . . that when the Moon should turn red, the people would know that the world was coming to an end. \"The Morning Star said further that in the beginn ing of all things they pl aced the North Star in the north, so that it should not move. . . . The Morn ing Star also said that in the beginning of all things they gave power to the S outh Star for it to move up close, once in a while, to look at the North Star to see if it were still standing in the north. If it were still standing there, it was to move back to its 8 Dorsey, ed., The Pawnee Mythology (1906), Pt. I, v>. 35. WORLDS IN COLLISION  191 place. . . . When the time approached for the worl d to end, the South Star would come higher. . . . The North Star would then disappear and move away and the South Star would take possession of the earth and of the people. . . . The old people knew also that when the world was to come to an end, there were to be many signs. Among the stars would be many si gns. Meteors would fly through the sky. The Moon would change its colo r once in a while. The Sun would also show different colors. \"My grandchild, some of the signs have come to pass. The stars have fallen among the people, but the Morning Star is still good to us, for we continue to live . . . . The command for the ending of all things will be given by th e North Star, and the South Star will carry out the command. . . . When the time comes for the ending of the wo rld, the stars will again fall to the earth.\" In this narrative of the Pawnee Indians, elements are brought together which, as we know now, actually belong together. The planet Venus estab lished the present order on the earth and placed the north and south polar stars in their places. The Pawnees believe that the future destruction of the world depends on the planet Venus. When th e end of the world will come, the North and South poles will change places. In the past the So uth Star left its place a few times and came up higher, bringing about a shifting of the poles, but on these occasions th e polar stars did not reverse their positions. The change in the color of the sun and the m oon was conditioned by the presence of cometary gases between the earth and thes e bodies; it is referred to in the Prophets of the Scriptures. Stones falling from the sky belong to the same complex of phenomena. The Pawnee Indians are not versed in astronomy. For one hundred and twenty generations father has transmitted to son and grandfather to grandchild the story of the past and the signs of future destruction. The belief that the world is endangered by the planet Venus plays an important role in the ritual of the Skidi Pawnee Indians of Nebraska. 192  WORLDS IN COLLISION robin-bobin"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Next in rank to Tirawa (Jupiter) stands the Morn ing Star. \"Tirawa gave most of his power to the Morning Star.\" 9 \"Through her four assist ants, Wind, Cloud, Lightning, and Thunder, she transmitted the mandates of Tirawa to the people upon earth.\" Next in rank to the Morning Star \"were the gods of four world-qua rters, who stood in the northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest and supported the heavens.

They recall the Mexican sacrifices to the Morning Star described by the authors of the sixteenth century. The meaning of these ceremonies and their relation to the planet Venus, especially in the years of a comet, the references to the cardinal points an d to prolonged darkness, the anxiety that the sky should not fall, and even such details as the black and red colors so important in the ceremonies, become understandable now that we know th e role Venus played in world upheavals.

Then for seventy-one nights it approaches the su n. Finally it enters th e inferior conjunction, when it is between the earth and the sun. It is usua lly invisible for one or two days, and thereafter appears west of the rising sun and is again the Morning Star. These movements of Venus and their exact durati on have been known to the people of the Orient and the Occident for over two thousand years. Actually a \"Venus year,\" which follows the synodical 194 WORLDS IN COLLISION  195 revolution of Venus, was employed in calendars of the Old and New World alike. Five synodical years of Venus equal 2919.6 days, whereas eight years of 365 days equal 2920 days, and eight Julian years of 365/4 days equal 2922 days. In other words, in four years there is a difference of approximately one day between the Venus and the Julian calendars. As I shall show in more detail in my recons truction of ancient history, the Egyptians of the second part of the first pre-Christian millennium observed the Venus year. A decree published in Egyptian and in Greek by the conclave of prie sts which took place in Ca nopus in the reign of Ptolemy III (Euergetes) in —239 was intended to reform the calendar \"according to the present arrangement of the world\" and \"an amendment of the faults of the heaven,\" replacing the year regulated by the rising of the star Isis—and Pli ny says that Isis is the planet Venus x—with a year regulated by the rising of the fixed star Soth is (Sirius); this would make a difference of one day in four years, so that, as the decree says, \"the festivals of the winter should not arrive in the summer because of the change of a day every fo ur years in the rising of the star Isis.\" 2 The reform intended by the Canopus Decree did not take root because the people and the conservatives among the priests kept faith with Venus and observed the New Year and other festivals on the days regulated by it. As a matter of fact, we know that the Ptolemaic pharaohs were obliged to swear in the temple of Isis (Ven us) that they would not reform the calendar, nor add a day every four years. Julius Caesar actually followed the Canopus Decree by fixing a calendar of 365/4 days. In —26 A ugustus introduced the Julian year in Alexandria, but the Egyptians outside Alexandria still continued to observe the Venus year of 365 days, and Claudius Ptolemy, the Alexandrian astronomer of the second Christian century, wrote in his Almagest: \"Eight Egyptian years without a sensib le error equal five circlings of Venus.\" 3 As this period of eight years can be divided in two, each part being 1 Pliny, Natural History, ii. 37. 2 S.

This is the meaning of Horapollo's information that the Egyptian year is equal to four years.4 In like manner the Greeks counted by four-year cycles dedicated to Athene: the Olympic games took place every fourth year (in the beginning, every ei ghth year5), and time was r eckoned by the Olympiads. The Olympic games were started in th e eighth century. At the Parthenon in Athens every fourth year was celebrated by the Pan-athenaic processions in honor of Athene. The Incas of Peru in South America and the Mayas and Toltecs in Central America observed the synodical revolution of Venus and the Venus year in addition to the solar year.6 They also calculated by groups of five Venus years equal to eight years of 365 days.

A few decades after the discovery of America, the Augustinian friar Ramon y Zamora wrote that the Mexican tribes held the Morning Star in gr eat veneration and kept a precise record of its appearance: \"So exact was the book-record of the day when it appeared and when it concealed itself, that they never made mistakes.\" u This was a very old custom originating in a past when Venus moved on an elongated orbit. The movements of Venus were carefully watched by the ancient astronomers of Mexico, India, Iran, and Babylonia. Temple observatories for the cult of the planets were built in both hemispheres. The bamot or \"high places\" so often mentioned in the Scriptures were observatories as well as places for offerings to the planet- gods, chiefly Venus (Baal). On these high places idolatrous priests, ordained by the erring kings of Judah, burned in cense to Baal, to the sun, and the moon, and to the planets.12 In the second half of the second millennium and in the beginning of the first millennium, Venus was still a comet; and though a comet can have a ci rcular orbit—there is such a comet in the solar system 13 —Venus was not then moving on a circular orbit as it does now; its orbit crossed the orbit of the earth and endangered it every fift y years. Since, by the second half of the eighth century before the present era, Venus' cycle was si milar to what it is today, it follows that some time before then Venus must have changed its orbit and achieved its pr esent circular path between Mercury and the earth and become the Morning and Evening Star. The irregularities in the movements of Venus must have been observed by the ancients; the data in the ancient records must differ 11 Seler, Gesammelte Abhandlungen, I, 624. 12 II Kings 23 : 5. 13 The Schwassmann-Wachmann comet, the orbit of which is between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn. 198 WORLDS IN COLLISION very much from the figures on Venus' movements given at the head of this section.

How explain these observations of the ancient as tronomers, modern astronomers and historians have asked. Were they written in a conditional form (\"If Venus disappeared on the 11th of Sivan . . .\") ? No, they were expressed categorically. The observations were \"inaccurately\" registered, decided some authors. However, inaccuracy may account for a few days' difference but not for a difference of months. \"The invisibility of Venus at superior conjuncti on is given as 5 months 16 days instead of the correct difference of 2 months 6 days,\" noted the translators of th e text, wonderingly.4 \"The period between the heliacal se tting of Venus and its rise is 72 days.

The (Greek) transl ation of the Seventy (Septuagint) reads: \"Canst thou bring forth Mazza roth in his season and guide the Evening Star by his long hair?\" These words of the Septuagint seem very strange. I have already mentioned that the Greek word komet means \"the long-haired one,\" or a star with ha ir, a comet. In Latin, coma is \"hair.\" Mazzaroth means a comet, wrote an exegete, a nd therefore, he argued, it cannot mean Venus.14 But in any case it is said that the Evening St ar has hair. Actually, Mazzaroth means Venus and a hairy star. Venus ceased to appear in its seasons. What had happened? Venus Becomes trie Morning Star Since the latter part of the ei ghth century before the present era, Venus has followed an orbit between Mercury and earth, whic h it has maintained ever sinc e. It became the Morning and Evening Star. Seen from the eart h, it is never removed more than 48 degrees (when at its eastern and western elongation) or three hours and a few minutes east or west of the sun. The dreaded comet became a tame planet. It has the most nearly circular orbit among the planets. The end of the terror which Venus kept alive for eight centuries after the days of the Exodus was the inspiration for Isaiah when he said: 1 \"How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! For thou ha st said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God.\" 12 See Schiaparelli, Astronomy in the Old Testament, p. 74. 13 Cambridge Bible, Book of Job, by A.

WORLDS IN COLLISION  203 Septuagint and Vulgate both translate Morning Star or Lucifer. What does it mean, that the Morning Star was assailing the heavens and risi ng high, and that it was cut down low to the horizon, and would weaken no more the nations? More than a hundred generations of commentators have occupied themselves with this passage, but have met with failure. Why, it is also asked, should the b eautiful Morning Star, called Luci fer, the Light Bearer, live in the imagination of peoples as an evil power, a fallen star? What is in this lovely planet that makes her name an equivalent of Satan, or Se th of the Egyptians, the dark power? In his confusion, Origen wrote this question to the quoted verses of Isaiah: \"Most evidently by these words is he shown to have fallen from heaven, w ho formerly was Lucifer, and who used to arise in the morning. For if, as some think, he was a na ture of darkness, how is Lucifer said to have robin-bobin"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"existed before? Or how could he arise in the morning, who had in himself nothing of the light?\" 2 Lucifer was a feared prodigy in the sky, and its origin, as illuminated in this book, explains how it came to be regarded as a dark power and a fallen star. After a great struggle, Venus achieved a circular orbit and a permanent place in the family of planets. During the perturbations which brought a bout this metamorphosis, Venus also lost its cometary tail. In the valley of the Euphrates, \"Venus then gives up her position as a great stellar divinity, equal with sun and moon, and joins the ranks of the other planets.\" 3 A comet became a planet. Venus was born as a comet in the second millennium before the present era. In the middle of that millennium it twice made contact with the earth a nd changed its cometary orbit. In the tenth to eighth centuries of the first millennium, it was still a comet.

PART II Mars •-¦ CHAPTER 1 Amos ABOUT seven hundred fifty years passed after the grea t catastrophe of the days of the Exodus, or seven centuries after the cosmic disturbance in the days of Joshua. During all this time the world was afraid of the recurren ce of the catastrophe at the end of every jubilee period. Then, starting about the middle of the eighth century be fore the present era, a new series of cosmic upheavals took place at intervals of short duration. It was the time of the Hebrew prophets whose b ooks are preserved in writing, of Assyrian kings whose annals are excavated and deciphered, and of Egyptian pharaohs of the Libyan and Ethiopian dynasties; in short, the catastrophes which we are now about to describe did not take place in a mist-shrouded past: the period is part of the well authenticated history of the lands of the eastern Mediterranean. The eighth century al so saw the beginning of the nations of Greece and Rome. The seers who prophesied in Judea were versed in the lore of heavenly mo tion; they observed the ways of the planetary and comet-ary bodies and, like the stargazers of Assyria and Babylonia, they were aware of future changes. In the eighth century, in the days of Uzziah, ki ng of Jerusalem, there occurred a devastating catastrophe called raash or \"com motion.\" 1 Amos, who lived at the time of Uzziah, began to predict a 1 Raash is translated \"earthquake,\" which is incorrect here; cf. Jeremiah 10 : 22: \"a great commotion [raash] out of the north.\" \"Earthquake\" is rendered in the Scriptures by words derived from the roots road, hul, regoz, hared, palez, ruf, and raash (commotion). 207 208  WORLDS 72V COLLISION cosmic upheaval before the raash took place, and after the catastrophe, Isaiah, Joel, Hosea, and Micah insisted unanimously and with great emphas is on the inevitability of another encounter of the earth with some cosmic body. The prophecy of Amos was made two years before th e raash (1:1). He declared that fire sent by the Lord would devour Syria, Edom, Moab, Ammon, and Philistia, as well as the far-off countries, \"with a tempest in the day of the whir lwind\" (1:14). The land of Israel would not be robin-bobin"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"exempted; \"great tumult\" would be on its mountai ns, and \"great houses shall have an end\" (3 : 15). \"He will smite the great house with breaches, and the little house with clefts\" (6 : ll).2 Amos warned those who invited the day of the Lord and waited for it: \"Woe unto you that desire the day of the Lord! To what end is it for you? Th e day of the Lord is darkness, and not light . . . even very dark, and no bri ghtness in it\" (5 : 18-20). Amos, the earliest among the prophets of Judah and Israel whose speeches are preserved in writing,3 reveals the concept of Ya hweh in that remote period of history. Yahweh orders the planets. \"He who maketh [ordains] Khima and Khes il,4 and turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night, and calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth, the Lord [Yahweh] is his name: He strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong\" (5 : 8-9). Amos prophesied: The land \"shall rise up wholly as a flood; and it shall be cast out and drowned, as by the flood of Egypt. And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord God, that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the clear day\" (8:8-9). The \"flood of Egypt\" mentioned by Amos may be a re ference to the catastrophe of the day of the Passage of the Sea; but more proba- 2 Rsisim, translated as \"breaches,\" is not str ong enough; it would be better to say, \"smite great houses into pieces.\" Hebrew words translated as \"breach\" in the King James Version are bedek, bkia, peretz, shever. 3 Some rabbinical authorities regard Hosea as th e oldest among the prophets of that time (Hosea, Amos, Isaiah). 4 The material for the identification of Khima as Saturn and Khesil as Mars will be presented in a subsequent part of this work. WORLDS IN COLLISION  209 bly it refers to an event w ithin the memory of the generation to which Amos spoke. In the reign of Osorkon II of the Libyan Dynasty in Egypt, in the third year, the first month of the second season, on the twelfth day, according to a damaged inscription,\" the flood came on, in this whole land . . . this land was in its power like the sea; there was no dyke of the people to withstand its fury. All the people were like birds upon it . . . the tempest . . . suspended . . . like the heavens. All the temples of Thebes were like marshes.\" 5 That it was not a seasonal inundatio n of the Nile is clear from th e date. \"This calendar date for the high level of inundation does not at all co rrespond to the place of the calendar in the seasons.\" 8 On the day of the approaching catastrophe, Amos says, there will be no place of escape, not even on Mount Carmel, rich in caves. \"Though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down. And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out thence\" (9 : 2-3). Earth will melt and the sea will be heaped up and thrown upon inhabited land. \"And the Lord God of hosts is he that toucheth the land, and it shall melt. . . . He that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon th e face of the ear th\" (9 : 5-6). Amos was persecuted and killed. The catastrophe did not fail to co me at the appointed time. In anticipation and in fear of it, King Uzziah went to the Temple to burn incense.7 The priests opposed his appropriating their functions. \"Suddenly th e earth started to quake so violently that a great breach was torn in the Temple.

Time was counted \"from the commotion in the days of Uzziah.\" * If this conclusion is correct, the upheaval took place in —747. The computation, according to which the era started on the twenty-sixth day of Fe bruary, must be re-examined in the light of the fact that further cosmic disturbances occurred during the decades that followed —747. It is worth noting, however, that the ancient inhabitants of Mexico celebrat ed their New Year on the day which corresponds, in the Julian cal endar, to the same date: \"The first day of their yeere was the sixe and twentie day of February.\" 5 The chronographer and Byzantine monk, Georgius Syn cellus, one of the chief sources of ancient chronology, synchronized the forty- eighth year of Uzziah and th e first year of the first Olympiad.6 But according to modern calculations, the first year of the first Olympiad was — 776.7 The Olympiads most probably were inaugurated by some cosmic event. The text of the ancient Chinese book of Shiking refers to some celestial phenomenon in the days of the king Yen-Yang, in —776: the sun was obscured.8 If the occurrence of —776 was of the same nature as that of —747, then Amos' prophecy was a prognostication based on an earlier experience. 3 K.

The destruction in the land was very great. \"Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fi re. . . . Except the Lord of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah\" (1 : 7 ff.). The very horizon of Je rusalem was disfigured by the splitting of the mountain on the west; and the ci ties were filled with debris and mutilated bodies. \"The hills did tremble, and . . . carcasses were torn in the midst of the streets\" (5 : 25). This was the event that kindled in Isaiah the prophetic spirit. During hi s long life—he prophesied in \"the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah\"—he did not cease to foretell the return of the catastr ophes. Isaiah was skilled in the observation of the stars, and he apparently knew that at peri odic intervals— every fifteen years—a catastrophe occurred, caused, he believed, by the messenger of God. \"His anger is not turned away, but his hand [sign 2] is stretched out still. And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from afar\" (5:25-26). Isaiah drew an apocalyptic pi cture of swiftly moving hostile tr oops. Was he prophesying a cruel and mighty people of warriors, or a host of missile s hurled from afar when he spoke of the army that would come swiftly from the end of th e world, called by the Lord? Their horses' hoofs would be like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind. \"If one look unto the land, behold darkness and sorrow; and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof\" (5 : 30). It is not the Assyrians on horses and in chariots that are compared to the flint a nd the whirlwind, but the flint and the whirlwind that are likened to warriors.3 The darkness at the end of the picture discloses that which is the object of comparison and that to which it is compared. 1 Seder Olam 20. 2 Yad is \"hand\" as we ll as \"sign.\" 3 See infra the Section, \"The Terrible Ones.\" WORLDS IN COLLISION  213 The catastrophe of the days of Uzziah was only a prelude: the day of wrath will return and will destroy the population \"until the ci ties be wasted without inhabitant\" (6 : 11). \"Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust\" (2 : 10)—all over the world caves in the rocks were regarded as the best places of refuge. \"And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, an d into the caves of the earth, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of his majesty, when he aris eth to shake terribly the earth\" (2 : 19). Isaiah appeared before King Ahaz and offered hi m a sign, on the earth or \"in the height above.\" Ahaz refused: \"I will not ask, neithe r will I tempt the Lord\" (7 : 12). Then Isaiah faced the people. \"And they shal l look unto the earth; and behold trouble and darkness, dimness of anguish\" (8 : 22). Neverthele ss, he said, the dimness will not be as great as on two former occasions when \"at the first he lightly afflicted th e land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee of the nations\" (9:1). He ca lculated that the next catastr ophe would cause less harm than had been caused on previous occasions. But soon thereafter he changed his prognostication and became utterly pessimistic. \"Through the wrath of the Lord of hos ts is the land darkened, and th e people shall be as the fuel of the fire\" (9 : 19). His rod will lift the sea up \"after the manner of Egypt,\" as on the day of the crossing of the Red Sea (10 : 26). \"And the Lord shall utterly destroy th e tongue of the Egyptian sea; and with his mighty wind shall he shake his hand [sign] over the river, and shall smite it in the seven streams\" (11 : 15). Nor will Palestine be spared. \"He shall shake his hand [sign] against . . . the hill of Jerusalem\" (10 : 32). robin-bobin"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Thus, a war of the heavenly host, commanded by th e Lord, was proclaimed against the nations of the earth. And the nations of the earth were arou sed by the expectation of Doomsday. \"The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great people; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together: the Lord of hosts mu stereth the host of the battle\" (13 : 4). This multitude comes 214  WORLDS IN COLLISION \"from the end of heaven, even the Lord, and the weapons of his indignati on, to destroy the whole land\" (13 : 5).

The world will be thrown off its axis: the heaven ly host \"will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the Lord of hosts , and in the day of his fierce anger\" (13 : 13). The nations \"shall flee far off, and shall be chas ed as the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and like a rolling thing before the whirlwind\" (17 : 13). Isaiah, on his vigils, watched the firmament, and in \"appointed times\" expe cted \"from the north a smoke\" (14 : 31). \"All ye inhabitants of the world . . . see ye, when he lifteth up an ensign on the mountains; and when he bloweth a trumpet, hear ye\" (18 : 3). The eyes of all \"dwellers of the earth\" were directed toward the sky, and they li stened to the bow els of the earth. Inquiries were sent to Jerusalem from Seir in Arabia: \"Watchman, what of the night?\" From his watchtower (\"Prepare the table, watch in the watc htower\") Isaiah gave his forecasts to inquirers (21:5; 21:11). Nervous tension grew with the approach of th e \"appointed time,\" and a rumor sufficed to drive the population of the cities to the housetops. \"Wha t aileth thee now, that thou art wholly gone up to the housetops?\" (22 : 1). Much of the city of David was damaged and many structures had fissures from almost continuous earth tremors (22 : 9). The seer frightened the population with his constant warnings of \"a day of trouble . . . and of perplexity by the Lord God of hosts,\" with \"breaking down the walls, and of crying to the mountains\" (22 : 5) . But many among the population took the attitude of those who before Doomsday say: \"Let us eat and drink; for to-morrow we shall die\" (22: 13).

Micah, another seer \"in the days of Jotham, Ah az, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah,\" warned that the day was close when \"the mountai ns shall be molten . . . and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire\" (Micah 1:4). \"Marvelous things\" will be shown, as in the days when Israel left Egypt: \"The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might . . . their ears shall be deaf . . . they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth\" (7 : 15-17). Joel, Micah, and Amos warned in similar terms of \"a day of thick darkness\" and \"the day dark with night.\" Astronomers, who thought that all this refers to a common eclipse of the sun, wondered: \"From —763 down to the destruction of the First Temple in —586 no total eclipse of the sun was visible in Palestine.\" * They took it for granted that the earth revolves along exactly the same orbit and on a slowly ro tating axis, and so they questione d: Why did the prophets speak of eclipses when there were none? However, other descriptions of the world catastrophe in these prophets do not accord with the effect s of an ordinary eclipse, either. The word shaog, used by Amos and Joel, is explained by the Talmud5 as an earthshock, the field of action of which is the entire world, whereas a regular earthquake is of local character.

It appears that a heavenly body passe d very close to the earth, moving, as it seems, in the same direction as the earth on its nocturnal side. \"Behold, the Lord maketh the earth empty, and make th it waste, and turneth it upside down. . . .

If the material remains of the palaces of My cenae and Tiryns are ascribed to the second millennium, then nothing has been found on the Argive plain that can be ascribed to the Argive tyrants, although they are known to have built spacious palaces. Thyestes and his brother Atreus were of these Ar give tyrants. Living in the eighth century, they must have witnessed the cosmic cat astrophes of the days of Isaiah. Greek tradition persists that a cosmic catastrophe occurred in the time of these tyrants: the sun changed its course and the night arrived before its proper time. Men should be prepared for ever ything and not wonder at anything, wrote Archilochus, since the day that Zeus \"turned midday into 'Tractate Sanhedrin 96a; Pirkei Rabbi Elieser 52; Hippolytus on Isaiah.

I give here Sen eca's description. In his drama, Thyestes, the chorus asks the sun: \"Whither, O father of the lands and skies, before whose rising thick night with all her glories flees, whither dost turn thy course and why dost blot out the day in mid-Olympus [midday]? Not yet does Vesper, twilight's messenger, summon the fi res of night; not yet does thy wheel, turning its western goal, bid free thy steeds from their co mpleted task; not yet as day fades into night has the third trump sounded; the ploughman with oxen yet unwearied stands amazed at his supper hour's quick coming. What has driven thee from thy heavenly course? . . . Has Typhoeus [Typhon] thrown off the mountainous mass and set his body free?\" 2 This picture reminds us of the desc ription of the day of Ahaz' burial. Seneca relates the fear of world destruction expe rienced by those who lived at the time of Atreus and Thyestes, the tyrants of the Argive plain. The hearts of men were oppressed with terror at the sight of the untimely sunset. \"The shadows aris e, though the night is no t yet ready. No stars come out; the heavens gleam not with any fires: no moon dispels the darkness' heavy pall. . . . Trembling, trembling are our hearts, sore smit with f ear, lest all things fall shattered in fatal ruin and once more gods and men be overwhelmed by formless chaos; lest th e lands, the encircling sea, and the stars that wander in the spa ngled sky, nature blot out once more.\" robin-bobin"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Will the seasons be ended and the moon carried away? \"No more\" shall th e stars \"mark off the summer and the winter times; no more shall L una, reflecting Phoebus' rays, dispel night's terrors.\" After the catastrophe of the days of Atreus a nd Thyestes, the luminaries crossed their former paths obliquely; the poles were shifted; the ye ar lengthened—the orbit of the earth became wider. \"The Zodiac, which, making passa ge through the sacred stars, crosses 1 Archilochus, Fragment 74. 2 Translated by F.

Seneca also says explicitly that the poles were to rn up in this cataclysm. The polar axis now is turned toward one of the stars, th e North Star, of the Little Bear. In the face of the cataclysm, when humanity was overwhelmed with awe, the heartbroken Thyestes, longing for death, called upon the universe to go down in utter confusion. The picture was not invented by Seneca: it was familiar because of what had happened in earlier ages. \"O thou, exalted ruler of the s ky, who sittest in majesty upon the throne of heaven, enwrap the whole universe in awful clouds, set the winds wa rring on every hand, and from every quarter of the sky let the loud thunder rol l; not with what hand thou seekest houses and undeserving homes, using thy lesser bolts, but with that hand by which the threefold ma ss of mountains fell . . . these arms let loose and hurl thy fires.\" Again Isaiah Time passed after the death of Ahaz, and the f ourteenth year of King Hezekiah approached.

After the cataclys ms of the days of Uzziah and of the funeral day of Ahaz, one did not have to be a prophet to foretell a new cosmic catastrophe. The earth will move out of its place, a scorching flame will devour the air, hot st ones will fall from the sky, and the waters of the sea will mount and des cend upon the continents. \"Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one, which as a tempest [cataract] of hail and a destroying storm, as a flood of mi ghty waters overflowing, shall ca st down to the earth with the hand\" (Isaiah 28 : 2). \"The mighty and strong one\" was a heavenly bod y, a missile of the Lord. Once more it was destined to scourge the earth. \"The overflow ing scourge shall pass th rough\" (28 : 18), was Isaiah's new prognostication. Although the pe ople of Jerusalem hoped that \"when the overflowing scourge shall pass th rough, it shall not come unto us\" (28 : 15), Jerusalem had no covenant with death.1 There will be no safe place of refuge. \"The waters shall overflow the hi ding place\" (28 : 17). \"A consumption even determined upon the whole earth\" (28 : 22). \"For the Lord . . , shall be wroth as in the vall ey of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his strange work; and bring to pass his act, his strange act\" (28 : 21). robin-bobin"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"What was the \"strange act\" in the valley of Gibe on?

The prophet, reading the signs of the sky, took upon himself the role of sentinel of the universe, and from his watchtower in Jerusalem he spread the alarm: 1 Cf.

Isaiah referred his readers to th e \"Book of the Lord\": \"Seek ye out of the book of the Lord, and read: no one of these shall fail\" (34 : 16). This book probably belonged to the same series as the Book of Jasher, in which the re cords of the days of Joshua at Gibeon were preserved; old traditions and astronomical observations must have been written down in the Book of the Lord, no longer extant.

Maimonides says: \" 'The stars have fallen,' 'The heavens are overthrown,' 'The sun is darkened,' 'The earth is waste and trembles,' 1 English translation by M. Friedlander (1928). 2 Maimonides apparently follows Philo, the Greek-writing Jewish philosopher of the first century, who in his The Eternity of the World wa s of the opinion that the world was created but that it is indestructible; however , Philo admitted changes in nature caused by periodic floods and conflagrations on a large s cale and of cosmic origin. 222  WORLDS IN COLLISION and similar metaphors\" are \"frequently empl oyed by Isaiah, and less frequently by other prophets, when they describe the ruin of a ki ngdom.\" In these phrases the term \"mankind\" is used occasionally; this is also a metaphor, says Maimonides. \"Sometimes the prophets use the term 'mankind' instead of 'the people of a cer tain place,' whose destruction they predict; e.g., Isaiah, speaking of the destruction of Israel, sa ys: 'And the Lord will remove man far away' (6 : 12). So also Zephaniah (1 : 3-4), 'And I will cut off man from off the earth.'\" He maintains that Isaiah and ot her seers of Israel, when examined by the realistic method of Aristotelianism, were persons inclined to ex aggerated forms of speech, and instead of saying, \"Babylon will fall,\" or \"fell,\" they spoke in term s of some fantastic perturbation in the cosmos above and beneath. \"When Isaiah received the divine mission to prophesy the destruction of the Babylonian empire, the death of Sennacherib and that of Nebuc hadnezzar, who rose afte r the overthrow of Sennacherib,3 he commences in the following manner to describe their fall . . . : 'For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof, shall not gi ve their light' (13 : 10); again, 'Therefore I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the Lord of hosts, and in the day of his fierce anger' (13 : 13). I do not think that any person is so foolish and blind, and so much in favour of the literal sense of figur ative and oratorical phrase s, as to assume that at the fall of the Babylonian kingdom a change took place in the nature of the stars of heaven, or in the light of the sun and moon, or that the earth moved away from its center. For all this is merely the description of a country that has been defeated; the inha bitants undoubtedly find all light dark, and all sweet things bitter: the whole earth appear s too narrow for them, and the heavens are changed in their eyes.\" \"He speaks in a similar manner when he describes . . . the loss of the entire land of Israel when it came into the possession of Sennacherib.

The prophet means to say that the individuals, who were like stars as regards th eir permanent, high, and undisturbed position, will quickly come down.\" Maimonides quotes Ezekiel, Joel, Amos, Micah, Haggai, Habak-kuk, and Psalms, and in verses similar to those cited from Isaiah, he finds incide ntally a description of \"a multitude of locusts,\" or a speech appropriate for the destruction of Samaria or the \"destruction of Medes and Persians,\" spoken \"in metaphors which are intelligible to those who understand the context.\" In a settled world nothing alters the given order. To sustain this doctrine, the prophecies were translated into metaphors, for, in the opinion of Maimonides, if the world does not change its regimented harmony, true prophets would not decl are that it does. \"Our opinion, in support of which we have quoted these passages,\" writes Maimonides, \"is clearly established, namely, that no prophet or sage has ever announced the destructi on of the Universe, or a change of its present condition, or a permanent change of any of its pr operties.\" This standpoint of Maimonides, as far as a change of conditions in the Universe is concerned, is a deduction, not from the texts he interprets, but from a philosophical a priori approach.

Maimonides asserts that Joel's prophecies referr ed to Sennacherib, but he is puzzled: \"You may perhaps object—how can the day of the fall of Sennacherib, according to our explanation, be called 'the great and the te rrible day of the Lord'?\" In the following pages it will be shown that on the very day which preceded the night when Sennacherib's army was destroyed, the order of na ture was upset. The speeches of the seers must be interpreted not apart from, but in the light of , the description of these changes as they are preserved in the Scriptures and in the Talmud.

In the time of Joshua the Hebrews held the or dinary opinion that the sun moves with a daily motion, and that the earth remains at rest; to this preconceived opinion they adapted the miracle which occurred during their battle with the five kings. They did not simply relate that the day was longer than usual, but asserted that the sun and moon stood still, or ceased from their motion.\" The deduction made is: \"Partly th rough religious motives, partly through preconceived opinions, they conceived of and related the occurrence as something quite differe nt from what really happened.\" \"It is necessary to know the opinions of those who fi rst related them . . . and to distinguish such opinions from the actual impr ession made upon our senses, otherwise we shall confound opinions and judgments with the actual miracle as it really occurred; nay, further, we shall confound actual even ts with symbolical and imaginary ones.\" The Book of Isaiah is offered by Spinoza as another example, and the chapter on Babylon's doomed destruction is quoted: \"The stars of heaven . . . shall not give thei r light; the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.\" The philosopher writes: \"Now I suppose no one imagines that at the destruction of Babylon these phenomena actually occurred any more than that which the prophet adds: 'For I will make the heavens to tremble, and remove the earth out of her place.

But apart from the events themselves, which this study endeavors to establish as historical, the words of Isaiah and of other seers and penmen of the Old Testament do not leave any room for doubt that by \"stones falling from the sky\" were meant meteorites; by brimst one and pitch were meant brimstone and pitch; by scorching blast of fire was meant scorching blast of fire; by storm and tempest, storm and tempest; by a darkened sun, by the earth removed from its place, by change of time and seasons, were meant just these changes in the regular processes of nature.

According to both sources, Sennacher ib took many cities; \"the proud Hezekiah, the Judean,\" was \"closed like a bird in a cage\" in his capital, Jerusalem, but Sennacherib did not capture Jerusalem; he satisfied himself with a tri bute of gold and silverx sent to him at Lachish in southern Palestine. After that he departed with his booty. Hezekiah had no choice but to submit; the defenses of the land were inadequate. Now he used the time, which he recognized as only a respite, to build walled strongholds and to garrison them, and to prepare the brooks and the we lls of the land to be stopped a nd destroyed at the first signal.

One of Sennacherib's generals, Rab-sh a-keh, came to Jerusalem and spoke with the emissaries of Hezekiah, loudly and in Hebrew, so that the warriors on the wall could hear him, too (Isaiah 36 : 18 ff.): \"Beware lest Hezekia h persuade you, saying, The Lord will deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?\" He also told them to consider the fate of Samari a, whose gods did not save it when it was stormed by the Assyrians. He informed them that Se nnacherib required pledges of submission and promised that they would be exiled to a land as good as their own. Hezekiah's emissaries were ordered not to enter into any dispute. Receiving no reply, Rab-sha-keh departed for Libna where King Sennacherib had gone from Lachish. The Ethiopian king Tirhakah came against Sennacherib out of the borders of Egypt and prep ared to meet him in battle. Rab-sha-keh sent again a demand to Hezekiah to submit: \"Let no t thy God deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.\" It was the prophecy of Isaiah that Jerusalem woul d not fall into the hands of the king of Assyria and that the king who blasphemed the Lord would be destroyed by \"a blast\" sent by the Lord. The story is described in detail three times in the Scriptures—i n II Kings 18-20, II Chronicles 32, and Isaiah, Chapters 36-38. The fi rst version alone contains the first part of the story about Sennacherib, who conquered all the fenced citie s of Judah, and Hezekiah, king of Judah, who submitted to the Assyrian king and paid tribute to him. All three scriptural sources tell about Hezekiah's rebelling against Sennacherib and refusi ng to submit or to pay tribute. It is obvious that, despite the repeated menti on of Lachish, there must have b een two different campaigns: in the first, Hezekiah submitted and agreed to pa y tribute; the second campaign was a number of years later. In the meantime, Hezekiah had built up \"all the wall that was broken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall without, and repair ed Milo in the city of David, and made darts and shields in abundance.

The annals of Sennacherib tell only the first part of the story: the capture of the cities of the land, the submission of Hezekiah, and the tribute he pa id. The siege of Lachish is not mentioned on the prism, but an Assyrian relief of this sieg e is preserved. Nothing is told in the Assyrian sources about defeat in Judea, and only the ep ilogue, the killing of Sennacherib by his own sons, is described identically in the Scriptures and in a cuneiform inscripti on of Esarhaddon, son of Sennacherib. robin-bobin"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"The destruction of Sennacherib's army having taken place in a late r—evidently the last— campaign of Sennacherib before his assassinat ion, it was not inserted on the eight-campaign prism; this must have been his ninth, or po ssibly his tenth, campaign. Its disastrous outcome would not have inspired the ki ng to order a new prism which s hould include this campaign, too. In the last century it was reali zed that the first part of the st ory in the Book of Kings is the counterpart of the record on the pr ism, and that the second part of the story in the Book of Kings, as well as the whole story in Ch ronicles and in the Book of Isai ah, is a separate record of a separate campaign in Palestine.2 2 H. Rawlinson was the first to assume two ca mpaigns of Sennacherib against Palestine. G. Rawlinson was of the same opinion. The Taylor Cylinder covers the tim e down to the 20th of Adar —691. H. Winckler supported this view with the argument that Tirhakah the Ethiopian became king of Ethiopia and Egypt after —691 : \"It can signify only a new campaign of Sennacherib which must have taken place after the destruction of Babylon (689 b. c. ) and of which we have no record by Sennacherib himself.\" The reference, \"in the fourteenth year of Hezekia h,\" in the beginning of the record in the Book of Kings, explains why the obvious fact that there were two campaigns escaped earlier commentators. Also, the mention of Lachish in both campaigns was a stumbling block. In this connection K. Fullerton remarked (\"The Invasion of Sennacherib\" in Biblioteca Sacra, 1906) that Richard Cceur de Lion also made Lachish a ba se of operations on two different crusades. Modern historians support the view that Tirhakah did not become king before -689. See also J. V. Prasek, \"Sanheribs Feldziige ge gen Juda,\" Mitt. d. Vorderasiat. Ges. (1903), and R.

Malach, translat ed as \"angel,\" means in Hebrew \"one who is sent to execute an order,\" supposed to be an order of the Lord.

It was not a flame, but a consuming blast: \"T heir souls were burnt, though thei r garments remained intact.\" The phenomenon was accompanied by a terrific noise.2 Arad ftbil is the Babylonian designation of ignis e coelo (fire from the sky).3 Another version of the destruction of the army of Sennacherib is give n by Herodotus. During his visit in Egypt, he heard from the Egyptian priest s or guides to the antiqui ties that the army of Sennacherib, while threatening th e borders of Egypt, was destroye d in a single night. According to this story, an image of a deity holding in his palm the figur e of a mouse was erected in an Egyptian temple to commemorate the miraculous ev ent. In explanation of the symbolic figure, Herodotus was told that myriads of mice des cended upon the Assyrian camp and gnawed away the cords of their bows and other weapons; deprived of their arms , the troops fled in panic. Josephus Flavius repeated the ve rsion of Herodotus, and added th at there is another version by the Chaldeo-Hellenistic historian Berosus. Josephus wrote introduc tory words to a quotation of Bero-sus, but the quotation itself is missing in the present text of the Jewish Antiquities. Obviously, it was an explanation different fr om that of Herodotus. Josephus' own account, somewhat rationalistic as usual, says a (bubonic) pla gue was the cause of the sudden death of one hundred and eighty-five thousand warriors in the camp of the Assyrians before the walls of Jerusalem on the very first night of the siege. Herodotus recounts that he saw th e statue of the god with a mouse in the palm of his hand, which was erected in memory of the event. 2 Tractate Shabbat 113b; Sanhedrin 94a; Jerome on Isaiah 10: 16; Ginzberg, Legends, VI, 363. 3Cf.

Herodotus did not trav el to the south of Egypt; thus, he must have seen the statue in Letopolis. Even toda y many bronze mice, sometimes inscribed with the prayers of pilgrims, are f ound in the ground of Letopolis. Both cities with the cult of the sacred mouse were \"sacred citi es of thunderbolt and meteorites.\" * The Egyptian name for Letopolis is indicated by the same hierog lyphic as \"thunderbolt.\" In a text dating from the New Kingdom and originati ng in Letopolis, it is said that a festival was established in this city in memory of \"the night of fire for the a dversaries.\" This fire was like \"the flame before the wind to the end of heaven and th e end of earth.\" ' \"I come forth and go in the devouring fire on the day of the repelling of the a dversaries,\" says the text in the name of the god. Thus tha god with the sacred mouse was a god of devouring fire. However, interpreting the mouse as a symbol of bubonic plague,* the commentators agreed with Josephus that Sennacherib's army must have been destroyed by a plague. It is peculiar that the numerous commenta tors of Herodotus and the no less numerous commentators of the Bible did not draw attention to a certain coincidence in these descriptions of the calamity. Hezekiah became gravely ill of so me bubonic affection and was near death. Isaiah was called. He told the king that he would die, but soon he re turned and offered a remedy—a lump of figs for the boil —and told the king th at the Lord would deliver him from immediate death and would also deliver \"this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria.\" \"And this shall be a sign unto thee from the Lord . . .

But the Talmudic tradition explains that the day was shortened by ten degrees on the day when Ahaz was buried, and the day was pr olonged by ten degrees when Hezekiah was ill and recovered, and this is the meaning of the \"s hadow of the degrees which is gone down in the sun dial of Ahaz.\" 9 The rabbinical sources state in a definite manner th at the disturbance in the movement of the sun happened on the evening of the destruction of Sennacherib's army by a devouring blast.10 Returning to Herodotus, we shall give our attention to the follow ing important fact neglected by the commentators. The famous paragraph of He rodotus which records, in the name of the Egyptian priests, that since Egypt became a kingdom, the sun had repeatedly changed its direction, is inserted in no ot her place of Herodotus' history, but directly following the story of the destruction of Sennacherib's army. The destruction of Sennacherib's army and the di sturbance in the movement of the sun are also described in two subsequent passage s of the Scriptures. Now the two records seem to be in better accord. 7 Isaiah 38 : 6-8; similarly in II Kings 20 : 9 ff. 8 Schiaparelli in Astronomy in the Old Testament, p. 99, points to a whole literature of \"curious and eccentric ideas\" written on the subject of die \"steps of Ahaz\" and refers to Winer's Bibl.

Gaseous masses reaching the atmosphere coul d asphyxiate all breath in certain areas. This explanation requires suppor ting statements from other s ources; disturbances in the movement of the sun could not be confined to the sun over Palestine and Egypt. Also, other circumstances of this catastrophe, like the ga seous masses covering the sky, should have been noticed in other regions of the earth, too. First, a more exact date for the night of th e annihilation of Sennacherib's army should be established. From modern research we know that it was in the year —687 (less probably in the year —686).

The record of Confucius is a precious entry, because th e time of the phenomenon—the day, the month, and the year—is given.

However, it di ffers from what is de scribed in the Book of Joshua in that it was not a phenomenon of a l ong pause by the sun, but of a short retrograde motion; in this the Chinese description corresp onds with the twentieth chapter of II Kings. The exact date of the reign of Han is not know n; it is sometimes supposed, on the basis of astronomical computation, to have been in the fifth cen tury before this era, or even later.8 If this is true, then the event described refers to a peri od before the dynasty of Han became dominant in China. robin-bobin"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"The land of China is large; it was divided into many princedoms.

He personified the planet Mars, to him was dedicated the month of March (Mars), and as a god he was supposed to be the father of Romulus, the founder of Rome. He was the national god of the Romans. Livy wrote in the pref ace to his history of Ro me, \"the mightiest of empires, next after that of Heaven\": \"The Roma n people . . . profess that their Father and the Father of their Empire was none other than Mars.\" Placing the time of Mars' activity as late as th e foundation of Rome indi cates that the Romans had a tradition that the city on the Tiber came into existence dur ing a generation which witnessed some great exploit of their god-planet. 1 Besides Ares, Hercules also represents the planet Mars. Eratosthenes (Era-tosthenis catasterismorum reliquiae, ed. C. Robert, 1878): \"Tertia est Stella Martis quam alii Herculis dixerunt\" (Mars is the third star, which others sa y is Hercules).

WORLDS IN COLLISION  239 The founding of Rome took place close in time to the great perturbations of nature in the days of Amos and Isaiah. According to th e calculation of Fabi us Pictor, Rome was founded in the latter half of the first year of the eighth Olympiad, or the year —747; other Roman authorities differ by a few years only.2 The year —747 is the beginning of an astronomical era in the Middle East; and the \"commotion of Uzziah\" took pl ace, apparently, in the same year. According to a persistent Roman tradition, th e conception of Romulus by his mother, the foundation of Rome, and the death of Romulu s occurred in years of great commotions accompanied by celestial phenomena and disturbances in solar movement. These changes were connected in some way with the planet Mars. Plutarch wrote: \"To the surname of Quirinus bestowed on Romulus some give the meaning of Mars.\" 3 The legend says that Romulus was conceived in the first year of the second Olympiad (—772) when the sun was totally eclipsed. According to Latin historians, on the very day of Rome's foundation, the sun was disrupted in its movement and the world was darkened.4 In Romu lus' time \"a plague fell upon the land, bringing sudden death without previous sick ness,\" and \"a rain of blood\" and other calamities. Earthquakes convulsed the earth for a long period. Jewish tradition knows that \"t he first settlers of Rome found that the huts collapsed as soon as built.\" 5 The death of Romulus occurred when, accord ing to Plutarch, \"suddenly strange and unaccountable disorders with incredible changes f illed the air; the light of the sun failed, and night came down upon them, not with peace and quiet, but with awful peals of thunder and furious blasts,\" and amidst th is storm Romulus disappeared.6 2 Polybius dated the foundation of Rome in the second year of the seventh Olympiad (—750); Porcius Cato, in the first year of the seventh Olympiad (—751); Verrius Flaccus, in the fourth year of the sixth Olympiad (—752); Terentius Varr o, in the third year of the sixth Olympiad (— 753); Censorinus followed Varro. 3 Plutarch, Lives, \"The Life of Romulus\" (transl.

The disturbance in the movement of the sun a few hours before the Assyrian host perished occurred on the first day of Pass over. The cataclysm of the days of the Exodus was caused by the planet Venus. Therefore, about th e time of the vernal equinox th ere were two festivals, one for the planet Mars, the other for the planet Venus, wh ich coincided in time. The festival of Minerva lasted from the nineteenth to the twenty-thi rd of March, and on Marc h 23rd, Mars, and also Minerva-Athene, were the honored deities.11 Mars Moves the Earth from Its Pivot Venus was a comet, and in historical times it b ecame a planet.

CHAPTER 3 What Caused Venus and Mars to Shift Their Orbits? WHEN VENUS became a new member of the sola r system, it moved on a stretched ellipse, and for centuries imperiled the other planets. Because of its dangerous circling, Venus was diligently observed in both hemispheres, and records were kept of its movement. In the last centuries before this era, the 288-day year of Venus, and apparently also its orbit, were practically the same as in modem times. As early as the second half of th e seventh century before this era, Venus, watched until then with anxiet y, had already ceased to be a cause of dreadful expectation; it probably reached then the orbital stage in which it was found in the last centuries before this era, and where we still find it toda y. What caused the change in the orbit of Venus? I shall pose another problem beside s the first. Mars did not arouse any fears in the hearts of the ancient astrologers, and its name was seldom mentioned in the second millennium. In Assyro- Babylonia, in inscriptions made before the ni nth century, the name of Nergal is found only on rare occasions. On the astronomical ceiling of Se nmut Mars does not appear among the planets. It did not play any conspicuous part in the early mythology of the celestial gods. But in the ninth or eighth century before this er a, the situation changed radically. Mars became the dreaded planet. Accordingly, Mars-Nergal rose to the position of the frightful storm and war god. The question must then present it self: Why, previous to that time, 244 WORLDS IN COLLISION 245 did Mars signify no danger to the earth, and what caused Mars to shift its orbit nearer to the earth? The planets of the solar system mo ve in nearly the same plane, and if one planet were to revolve along a stretched ellipse, it would endanger the other planets. The two problems—what caused Venus to change its orbit, and what caused Mars to change its orbit—may have a common explanation. The common cause may have been so me comet which changed the orbits of Venus and Mars; but it is simpler to suppose that two planets, one of which had a greatly elongated orbit, collided, and that no third agent was necessary to bring about that result. A conflict between Venus and Mars, if it occurr ed, might well have been a spectacle observable from the earth. It is not impossibl e that the two planets came rep eatedly into contact, each time with different results. If a contact between Venus and Mars really occurred and was observed from the earth, it must have been commemorated in trad itions or litera ry monuments. When Was the Iliad Created?

It is generally assumed th at the fall of Troy antedated Homer by several generations, and also that the gr eat epic works were the creation of generations. The fall of Troy is sometimes thought to have ta ken place in the twelfth century.3 On the other hand, it has been shown that the cultu ral background of the Home ric epos is that of the eighth or even the seventh century; th e age of iron was well under way, and many other details would preclude an earlier scene.4 It is high ly probable that the Homeric works were created at that time or shortly thereafter. Whether these poems were first sung by a bard who lived centuries after the destru ction of Troy depends on the time when Troy was destroyed. The tradition about Aeneas who, saved when Troy was cap tured, went to Carthage (a city built in the ninth century) and from there to Italy, where he founded Rome (a city first built in the middle of the eighth century), implies that Troy was destroyed in the eighth or late in the ninth century. But for what purpose do I burden my present work w ith this question? It may seem that the two problems—how Venus changed its orbit to a circle , and how Mars changed its orbit so as to come in contact with the earth—are weighted wi th a third problem from a far-removed field and in itself complicated. And even if these matters have something in common, how can a problem with three unknowns be solved? We shall come closer to a solu tion of the astronomical problem 2 See R.

WORLDS IN COLLISION  247 with which we are concerned a nd the problem of the epics of Troy if we recognize the cosmic scene of these epics. A simple test can be made. If Ares, the Mars of the Greeks, is not mentioned in the creations of Homer, this would support the view that the Iliad and Odyssey were created in the tenth century or earlier, or at le ast that the drama they describe had take n place not later than this time. But if Ares is presented as a war god in these epics, it would indicate that they were composed in the eighth century or thereafter. It was in the eigh th century that Mars-Ner gal, an obscure deity, became a prominent god. Epic poems, rich in mythol ogy, that originated in the eighth or seventh century, would not be silent about Mars-Ares, who became \"outrageous\" at that time. With this yardstick at hand, the epic poems of Homer must be re-examined. The task will not be difficult; the Iliad is full of descriptions of the violent deeds of Ares. In this epic the story is told of the battles which the Greeks, besieging Troy, waged against the people of Priam, king of Troy. Deities took a promin ent part in these battles and skirmishes. Two of them— Athene and Ares—were by far the most active. Athene was the protectress of the Greeks; Ares was on the side of the Trojans. They were the chief antagonists throughout the epopee.

The commentators were aware that originally Ares was not merely the god of war, and that this quality is a deduced and secondary one. The Gr eek Ares is the Latin planet Mars; it is so stated in classic literature a multitude of times . In the so-called Homeric poems, too, it is said that Ares is a planet. The Ho meric hymn to Ares reads: Most mighty Ares . . . chieftain of valor, re volving thy fiery circle in ether among the seven wandering stars [planets], where thy flaming st eeds ever uplift thee above the third chariot.6 But what might it mean, that the planet Mars destr oys cities, or that the planet Mars is ascending the sky in a darkened cloud, or that it engages At hene (the planet Venus) in battle? Ares must have represented some element in nature, guessed the commentators. Ares must have been the personification of the raging storm, or the god of the sky, or the god of light, or a sun-god, and so on.7 These explanations are futile.

This author of the second century of the pr esent era writes in his work On Astrology this most significant and most neglected commentary on the Homeric epics: \"All that he [Homer] hath said of Venus and of Mars his passion, is also manifestly composed from no other source than this science [astrol ogy]. Indeed, it is the conjuncture of Venus and Mars that creates the poetry of Homer.\" 8 Lucian is unaware that Athene is the goddess of the planet Venus,9 6 The Odyssey of Homer with the Hymns (tra nsl.

Evelyn-White (Hesiod volume in the Loeb Classi cal Library) is: \"Who wh irl your fiery sphere among the planets in their sevenf old courses through the ether wher ein your blazing steeds ever bear you above the third firmament of heaven.\" Allen, Holliday, and Sikes, The Homeric Hymns (1936), p. 385, regard the hymn to Ares as post-Homeric. 7 These divergent views are offered by L.

My interpretation of the Homeric poem, I find, has been anticipated by still others. Who they were, it is impossible to say. However, Heraclitus, a little known author of the first century, who should not be confused with the philosopher, He raclitus of Ephesus, wrote a work on Homeric allegories.10 In his opinion, Homer and Plato were the two greates t spirits of Greece, and he tried to reconcile the anthropomorphic and satiric description of gods by Homer with the idealistic and metaphysical appro ach of Plato. In Paragraph 53 of his Allegories, Heraclitus confutes those who think that the battles of the gods in the Iliad signify col lisions of the planets. Thus I find that some of the ancient philosophers must have held the same opinion at which I arrived independently afte r a series of deductions. The problem of the date when the Homeric epics or iginated was raised here, to be solved with the help of this criterion: If the cosmic battle between the planets Venus and Mars is mentioned there, then the epics could not have originated much before th e year —800. If the earth and the moon are involved in this struggle, the time of the birth of the Iliad must be lowered to —747 at least and probably to an even later date. The first earthshaking contac t with our planet had already taken place, and for this reason Ares is re peatedly called \"bane of mortals, blood-stained stormer of walls.\" Homer was thus, at the earliest, a contemporary of the prophets Amos and Isaiah, or more likely he lived shortly after them. Th e Trojan War and the cosmic c onflict were synchronous; the time of Homer was not separated from the time of th e Trojan war by several centuries, possibly not even by a single one. The statement by Lucian regarding the inspiring drama of the Homeric epics—the conjunction of the planets Venus and Mars—can be refined. There was more than one fateful conjunction between Venus and Mars—at least two are described in the Iliad, in the fifth i° Heracliti questiones Homericae (Teubner's ed. 1910). Cf. F. Boll, Stemglaube und Sterndienst (ed. W. Gundel, 1926), p. 201. WORLDS IN COLLISION  253 and the twenty-first books. The conjunctions were near contacts; the mere passage of one planet in front of another could not have pr ovided material for a cosmic drama.

H. Bancroft writes: \"Huitzilopochtli had, like Mars a nd Odin, the spear or a bow in his right hand, and in the left, sometimes a bundle of arrows, sometimes a round white shield. . . . On these weapons depended the welfare of the state, just as on the ancile of the Roman Mars, which had fallen from the sky, or on the palladium of the warlike Pallas Athene .

But the Aztecs would not concede the death of Ma rs, the bellicose destroyer of towns, the god of sword and pestilence, and carried on their wars against the Toltecs, the people who looked to the planet Venus. These wars between the Toltecs and the Aztecs must have taken place earlier than is generally supposed; they might have occurred before the present era, when there was rivalry between the peoples devoted to Venus and those devoted to Mars, and when the memory of the cosmic conflict was still vivid.

But ancient Hindu as tronomy distinguished between many different conjunctions, tr anslated as follows: samyoga (conjunction), sama-gama (coming together), yoga (junction), melaka (uniting), yut i (union), yuddha (encounter, in the meaning of conflict, fight).1 The first paragraph of this chapter, \"Of planet ary conjunctions,\" of the Surya-Siddhanta tells us that between planets there occu r encounters in battle (yuddha) and simple conjunction (samyoga samagama). The force of the planets, which mani fests itself in conjunc tions, is called hala. A planet can be vanquished (jita) in an \"apasvya encounter,\" struck down (vidhvasta), utterly vanquished (vijita). A powerful pl anet is called balin, and the vi ctor-planet in an encounter, jayin. \"Venus is generally victor.\" To the last sentence the translat or of Surya-Siddhanta wrote: \"I n this passage we quit the proper domain of astronomy, and trench upon that of as trology.\" Aside from the introductory lines in which the work is presented as a reve lation of the sun (a common introduc- 7 Hoei-nan-tze in Textes Taoistes. 8 L.

We know now that th is chapter has equal scientific value with other chapters of the work and that encounters between planets actu ally took place a number of times in the solar system.

After centuries of terror, one sword of Damocl es was removed from above the heads of mankind, only to be replaced by another. Mars became the dr ead of the peoples, and its return was feared every fifteen years. Before this, Mars had absorb ed the blow, even the re peated blows of Venus, and had saved the earth. Venus, which collided with the earth in the fifteen th century before the present era, collided with Mars in the eighth century. At th at time Venus was moving at a lo wer elliptical velocity than when it first encountered the ea rth; but Mars, being only about one-eighth the mass of Venus, was no match for her. It was therefore a notable achievement that Mars, though thrown out of the ring, nevertheless was instrumental in bringing Venus from an ellipt ical to a nearly circular 1 orbit. Looked at from the earth, Venus was removed from a path that ran high to the zenith and over the zenith to its present path 2 in which it never retreats from the sun more than 48 degrees, thus becoming a morning or an evening star that precedes the rising sun or follows the setting sun.

The metaphor regarding the king of Babylon implied that his fate and the fate of the Morning Star were not dissimilar; both of them fell from on high. But what could it mean th at the Morning Star fell from the heights? asked the commentators.

In old astrological texts, as in the book of Prophecies of Daniel, co mets that took the form of a sw ord were originally related to the planet Mars.5 Besides the swordlike appearance of the atmosphere of Mars, elongated on its approach to the earth, there was also another reas on to make of the planet Mars the god of war. A bellicose or martial character was ascribed to the planet beca use of the great exciteme nt it caused, excitement that brought anxiety to peoples, th at led to migrations and to wa rs.

In Egypt an inscription of the eighth century that refers to the moon disturbed in its movement, mentions incessant fighting in the land: \"While years passed in hostility, each one seizin g upon his neighbor, not remembering his son to protect.\"1 Isaiah, speaking of the Day of Wrath, says: \"And I will se t the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they shall fight every one against his brother, and ev ery one against his neighbor; city against city, and kingdom against kingdom.\" 2 It was no differen t seven hundred years earlier, in the days of the catastrophes caused by Venus. At that time an Egyptian sage complained: \"I show thee the land upside down; the sun is veiled and shines not in the sight of men. I show thee the son as enemy, the brother as foe, a man slaying his father.\" 3 The Icelandic Voluspa says: \"Dark grows the sun. . . . Brothers shall fight and fell each other. . . .

The campaigns were repeatedly interrupted by the forces of nature . Of his second campaign Se nnacherib wrote: \"The month of rain set in with extreme cold and th e heavy storms sent down rain upon rain and snow.

The Ethiopian king who went up against Sennacher ib called himself Taharka or Tirhakah.11 In many places in the Near and Middle East this or similar names suddenly became very popular at the close of the eighth century before the present era; before that time it was unknown. Taraka troubled the world so that The seasons have forgotten how to follow one an other now; they simultane ously bring flowers of autumn, summer, spring.

We can assume that Berosus knew that the catastr ophe was caused by a planet in contact with the earth. Seneca, in his work, Natura les quaestiones, described the cataclysms of water and fire that visited this world and brought it to the brink of destruction. He also presented the opinion of Berosus, which is remarkable in that it reflect s ancient knowledge similar to that at which we arrived after a long series of deductions and conclusions. Seneca wrote: \"Berosus, the translator of Bel, attributed to the planets the cause of thes e perturbations.\" And he a dded: \"His certainty in this matter was so great as to fix the dates of the universal conflagrati on and deluge. Everything terrestrial, he says, will be burned, when the st ars which now follow different orbits will reunite in the sign of Cancer, and will place themselves in one line, so that a straight line would pass through the centers of all these globes. The deluge will come when the same planets will have conjunction in Capricorn.\" 1 Disregarding the specific details of this assu mption, there still remains a kernel of truth. The catastrophes of flood and of conflagration were ascribed to the influence of planets, and the conjunction was called the fatal moment. Such bei ng the opinion of Berosus on the cause of the world catastrophes, the catastrophe that befell Sennacherib was pr obably explained by him in the same way. We are thus able to reconstruct Berosus' record which was omitted in Josephus. Chaldean scholars were aware that the planetary system is not ri gid and that the planets undergo changes. We find in Diodorus of Sicily: \"Each of the planets, according to them [the Chaldeans] has its own particular course, a nd its velocities and periods of time are subject to change and variation.\" 2 They counted the earth among the planets, for Diodor us wrote that the Chaldeans stated \"that the 1 The same idea, but with varying positions of th e stars as the cause of the catastrophes, is found in Nigidius, quoted by Lucan, and in Olvmpi odor, Commentary to Aristotle.

Another marvel, that the earth herself hangs susp ended and does not fall a nd carry us with it.\" n The earth, one of the planets, had been subject to conflicts with other pl anets, and traces of knowledge of these occurrences may be found in th e early writers. Origen writing against Celsus stated: \"We do not refer either the deluge or the conflagration to the cycles and planetary periods; but the cause of them we declare to be the extensive prevalence of wickedness, and its (consequent) removal by a deluge or a conflagrati on.\" 12 Celsus and Origen were familiar with the view that the deluge and th e world conflagration were caused by planets, and that these world catastrophes could be calculated in advance. Pliny wrote: \"Most men are not acquainted with a truth known to the founders of the science from their arduous study of the heavens,\" namely, that thunderbolts \"are the fires of the three upper planets.\" 13 He differentiated them from lightning caused by the dash ing together of two clouds.

By Tuscan writings are meant Etruscan books. Bolsena, or the ancient Volsinium, was one of the chief cities of the Etruscans, the people whose civilization preceded that of the Latin Romans on the Apennine Peninsula. The Etruscan states occupied the area of what was later known as Tuscany, between the Tiber and the Arno. Near Bolsena, or Volsinium, is a lake of the same name. This lake fills a basin nine miles long, seven miles wide, and 285 feet deep. For a long time this basin was regarded as the water-filled crater of a volcano. However, its area of 117 squa re kilometers exceeds by far that of the largest known craters on the earth—those in the Andes in South America and those in the Hawaiian (Sandwich) Islands in the Pacific. Hence, the idea that the lake is the crat er of an extinct volcano has recently been questioned. Mo reover, although the bottom of th e lake is of lava, and the ground around the lake abounds with ashes and lava and columns of basalt, the talus of a volcano is lacking. Taking what Pliny said of an interplanetary disc harge together with what has actually been found at Volsinium, one may wonder whet her the cinders and the lava a nd the columns of basalt could possibly be the remains of the contact Pliny mentions. Again, if the discharge was caused by Mars, it would probably have occurred in the ei ghth pre-Christian centu ry. The catastrophes of that century brought the great Etruscan civilization into s udden decline and launched the migration of newcomers to Italy leading to th e founding of Rome. The Etruscans, as cited by Censorinus and quoted in the Section on \"The World Ages,\" thought that celestial prodigies augured the end of each age. \"The Etruscans were versed in the science of the stars, and after having observed the prodigies with attention, they recorded these observations in their books.\" is ibid. \" Ibid., ii. 53. 274 WORLDS IN COLLISION The Stormer of the Walls Following the upheavals in which, in the words of the Babylonians, Mars-Nergal \"moved the earth off its hinges,\" and, in the words of Is aiah, \"the earth moved exceedingly\" and was \"removed out of her place,\" mighty and repeat ed earthquakes devastated whole countries, destroyed cities, and shattered th e walls of strongholds. \"Bloodstained stormer of walls\" is the ever repeated epithet of Ares in Homer. Hesiod , too, calls Ares \"sacker of towns.\"* \"Behold,\" said Amos, \"the Lord commandeth, and he w ill smite the great house with breaches [into pieces].\" Then came the \"commotion\" of the days of Uzziah, and of the days of Ahaz, and of the days of Hezekiah, when \"the bricks are fallen down\" (Isaiah 9 :10) and only \"a very small remnant\" of the people remained (Isaiah 1:9). Those were days of \"trouble, and of treading down, and of perplexity by the Lord God of Ho sts\" and \"breaking down the walls\" (Isaiah 22 : 5). Recurrent displacement of the terr estrial globe, torsion of the lit ho-sphere, and migration of the inner parts of the globe must have caused a succession of earthquakes over a prolonged period. But in comparison with the great catastrophes, when \"heaven reeled,\" the local earthquakes received only slight attention.

In some of these reports, Nergal (Mars) is mentioned as the cause of the calamity. \"The earth shook; a collapsing catastrophe wa s all over the country; Nergal strangles the country.\"4 Temples constructed with great care, so that the founda tions might absorb shocks and resist them, were often destroye d by the catastrophes, and the cause was again the planet Nergal. Thus Nergal is referred to in connection with the collapse of the temple in Nippur that was destroyed in an earthquake.5 The kings of Babylon, the successors to Sennacher ib, record im many inscriptions the repairing of breaches in the palaces and temples of the la nd. Sometimes the same temples or palaces were repaired by two kings in close succession, as in the case of Nergil issar (Neriglissar) and Nebuchadnezzar.8 In the great catastrophes of the ei ghth to the seventh centuries, practically no structure escaped damage, and new buildings were erected so as to absorb frequent shocks. At the close of the seventh century, Nebuchadnezzar described the precautions taken in placing the foundations of the palaces \"on the breast of th e netherworld\"; these foundations of large stones with joints fitting one into the other have been unearthed in excavations.7 The Babylonians also found that walls of burnt bricks we re of greater elasticity than wa lls of stones; they were built on foundations of great blocks of stone.8 These ever recurrent earthshocks in a country as rich in oil as Mesopotamia also caused eruptions of earth deposits: \"The earth threw oi l and asphalt,\" observed th e official astrologers, as the effect of an earthquake.9 3 See Kugler, Babylonische Zeitordnung, p. 116. 4 Ibid. 5 Langdon, Sumerian and Babylonian Psalms, p. 99. • See the Section \"Mars Moves th e Earth from Its Pivot,\" note 6. 7 R.

The folding of the crust creates m ountains and causes earthquakes. Another theory sees the cause of earthquakes in the migration of 10 Josephus, Antiquities, IX. x. 4.

This theory, too, is based on the concept of a thin crust resting on a viscous substratum. Geological and faunal similarities of South America and West Africa suggested their separation in recent geol ogical times, and their migration in opposite directions. According to this theory, thermal convection is the mechanical cause of this migration, with magma supplying the heat. Still another theory supposes that there are gr eat mountains and deep va lleys on the inner surface of the crust, facing the magma. The sliding of huge rocks along these mountainous slopes under the pull of gravity is presumed to be the cause of earthquakes. The mountainous western coast of North and South Am erica, or the shore of the Cordilleras, and the eastern coast of Asia stretching into the East Indies form the area of greatest earthquake activity, with 80 per cent of the entire mechanical force released in earthquakes concentrated there. Another area stretches from the Me diterranean toward the highland of Asia. In an attempt to find the relation of earthqua kes to other natural phenomena, a statistical investigation of the earthquakes of the middle of the nineteenth century was conducted, and the results suggested that earthquake s are more numerous when the moon is new and again when it is full, or when the pull of the moon acts in the same direction as the pull of the sun or when it acts in the opposite direction. The time when the moon is in perige e, or closest to the earth, was also found to be favorable for earthquakes.16 Thes e observations were challenged as to their general validity. However, mountain building is a process the causes of which have not been established; the migration of continents is but a hypothesis; and the crumbling of the earth's crust must have some additional cause besides the force of gravit y, because this force was active when the crust was built and made possible the formation of the crust in its present shape. Hence, all these theories are only hypotheses about unknown causes of known phenomena. On the basis of the material offered in the foregoing pages, the assumption is made here that earthquakes result from torsion of the 16 Cf . the scientific public ations of A.

Th is passage of Swift aroused the literary critics' wonder. It is an even chance that Swift invented the two satellites of Mars and thus by a rare accident came close to the truth. But it may also have been that Swift had read about the trabants in some text not known to us or to his contemporaries. Th e fact is that Homer kne w about the \"two steeds of Mars\" that drew his chariot; Virgil also wrote about them.6 When Mars was very close to the earth, its two trab ants were visible. They rushed in front of and around Mars; in the disturbances that took place, they proba bly snatched some of Mars' atmosphere, dispersed as it was, and appeared with gleaming manes.7 The steeds were yoked when Mars (Ares) prepared to desc end to the earth on a punitive expedition. robin-bobin"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"When Asaph Hall discovered the satellites, he gave them the names of Phobos (Terror) and Deimos (Rout), the two steeds of Mars; 8 without fully realizi ng what he did, he gave the satellites the same names by which they were known to the ancients.

Ares of Homer, going into battle, is accompanied by never resting horrible creatures, Terror, Rout, and Discord. Terror and Rout yoke the gleaming horses of Ares, themselves dreadful beasts, also known by these names; Discord, \"sis ter and comrade of man-slaying Ares, rageth incessantly; she at the first rears her crest but litt le, yet thereafter planteth her head in heaven, while her feet tread on earth.\" Similarly, the Babylonians saw the planet Mars-Ner gal in the company of demons, and wrote in their hymns to Nergal: 2 \"Great giants, raging de mons, with awesome memb ers, run at his right and at his left.\" These \"raging demons\" are pictured also in the Nergal-Eriskigal poem; 3 they bring pestilence and cause earthquakes.

In more than this one instance it is possible to show that peoples, separated even by broad ocean s, have described some spectacle in similar terms.

The spectators saw in the celestial prodigies either demons, as the Erinyes of the Greeks or the Furies of the Latins, or gods whom they invoked in prayers, as in the Vedas of the Hindus, or the executors of the Lord's wrath, as in Joel and Isaiah. In the Section \"Isaiah\" we maintained that the ar my of the Lord was not the Assyrian host, but a celestial host. Isaiah called the army of the Most High \"the terrible ones.\" And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly: None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of th eir shoes be broken: Whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent, their horses' hoofs shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind.

Certainly only by chance did the similari ty of names and pictures in the Vedas and the Prophets escape the attenti on of students of religion. The Maruts are understood here as comets which in great numbers started to whirl in the sky on short orbits, after the impact of Mars and Venus. They followed and preceded the planet Mars. The name Mars (genitive, Martis) would be of the same origin as Marut. It is therefore gratifying to read that the philological re lation has already been established.28 It is even more satisfactory that this philological equation was made without knowledge of the actual relation between the planet Mars and \"t he terrible ones.\" By comparing Hebrew historical , Chinese astronomical, and Latin ecclesiastical material, we have established that it was the planet Mars wh ich caused a series of cat astrophes in the eighth and seventh centuries before this era. The Gr eek epos explained how it happened that Venus ceased and Mars began to be a threat to the ear th. In heavenly battles, Ares or Nergal, both known as the planet Mars, had an entourage of demoniac figures. The name Mars is derived from the Indian Marut; Maruts, \"t he terrible ones,\" are \"the terri ble ones\" of Isaiah and Joel. The origin of the Greek name Ares was de bated by philologists,29 and reasons against a common root with the identical Mars were admitted. It seems to me that just as Mars is derived from Marut, \"the terrible ones\" of the Vedas, so Ares was formed from the \"terrible one\" of the Hebrew, which, as used by Jo el and Isaiah, is ariz. In a no longer extant passage of Pliny there was something said about comets being produced by planets.30 Also the Soochow Chart 28 \"Why should we object to Mars, Martis as a parallel form of Maruts? I do not say the two words are identical, I only maintain that the root is the same. . . . If there could be any doubt as to the original identity of Marut and Mars, it is dispelled by the Umbrian name cerfo Martio, which, as Grassmann (Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XVI, 190, et c.) has shown, corresponds exactly to the expression sardha-s maruta-s, the host of the Ma ruts.

The stone of Cronus at Delphi,4 the image of Dian a at Ephesus, which, ac cording to Acts (19 : 35), was the image which fell down from Jupiter, the stones of Amon and Seth at Thebes,5 were meteorites.

In the years when the planet Mars had long b een pacified, its position was still watched when meteorites fell.

Gabriel is the angel appointed over fire; he is al so, according to Origen,8 the angel of war. Thus we again recognize in him Mars-Nergal. The rabbin ical tradition says that the Assyrians of the host of Sennacherib, before they died, were permitted by Gabriel to hear \"the song of the celestials,\" which can be interpreted as the soun d caused by a close appro ach of the planet. The words of Isaiah (33 : 3), \"at the noise of the tumult [hamon] the people fled,\" should, according to the Jewish tradition as related by Jerome, refer to Gabriel, Hamon being another of his names.9 The planet Mars is red, and Maadim (the red or the one who reddens) is the name for Mars in the Hebrew astronomical texts. One text says: \"T he Holy One created Mars—Maadim—that he should throw them [the nations] down into hell.\"10 A few rabbinical sources attribute the destructio n of Sennacherib's army to the action of the Archangel Michael; some ascribe it to both ar changels.11 Who, then, is the Archangel Michael?

According to the Midrash,12 it was the Archangel Michael who made himself \"a wall of fire\" between the Israelit es and the Egyptians. Michael is said to be made of fire. The Haggadah states: \"Michael was appointed High Priest of the celestial sanctu ary at the same time that Aaron was made high priest of Israel,\" that is, in the time of the Exodus. Michael was also the angel who appeared to Joshua, son of Nun. The celestial struggle at the Sea of Passage is de picted in the familiar image of the Archangel Michael slaying the dragon. Michael produces fire by touching the earth, and it was the emanation of this archangel that was seen in the burning bush. He has his abode in heaven and is the forerunner of Shehina or God's presence, but as Lucifer, Michael falls from heaven and his hands are bound by God. All these attributes and acts of the Archangel Michael13 lead us to recognize which planet he represents: it is Venus. The Archangel Michael, or the planet Venus, and the Archangel Gabriel, or the planet Mars, saved the people of Israel on two dramatic occasi ons. At the Sea of Passage, when the hosts of Egypt, pursuing the fleeing slaves, c ould be seen in the distance (\"th e children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were so re afraid\" 14), the sea was torn apart, and the slaves walked on the bottom of the sea and reached the other shore. Their enemies were thrown high by the released tides, which fell down when a spark passed between Venus and the earth. Eight hundred years passed after the Exodus. The A ssyrian hosts, which a generation earlier had removed the Ten Tribes of Israel to an exile from whence they never returned, invaded Judea with the express purpose of cr ushing rebellious Judah and rem oving him from his homeland and from the scene of history. A blast from the planet Mars fell upon the camp of the Assyrians and annihilated it. Those rabbinical sources which ascribed this act to both archangels were 12 Pirkei Rabbi Elieser 42. 13 An extensive literature on the Archangel Mich ael can be found in Ginzberg, Legends, Index Volume, under \"Michael.\" \" Exodus 14 : 10. 294  WORLDS IN COLLISION not wrong. Venus pushed Mars toward the earth, and thus both were instrumental in the destruction. The author of the apocryphal book of the Ascen sion [Assumption] of Moses knew that \"Venus and Mars are each as large as the whole Earth.\"15 Because of their intervention at moments when th e national existence of Israel was at stake, Michael and Gabriel were looked upon as \" guardian angels\" of the eternal people. Gabriel is the Hebrew Hercules (Heracles). Ac tually the classic authors made it clear that Hercules is another name for th e planet Mars.18 In the Gospel of Luke (1 : 26) Gabriel is the angel of Annunciation to the Virgin. In the Roman Catholic Church Michael is the co nqueror of Satan, \"head of the host of heaven and first of the saints after Mary.\" Planet Worship in Judea in the Seventh Century In the Northern Kingdom the process of disassoci ating the deity from the celestial object had not yet been completed when the Kingdom was de stroyed (—723 or —722), and its population was led away into captivity, from which they did not return. \"And they [the tribes of the Northern Kingdom] left all the commandments of the Lord their God, and made them molten images, even two calves, and made a grove, and worshiped all the host of heaven and served Baal\" (II Kings 17 : 16). Only a few years after the deliverance of Judea from the hand of Sennacherib, Manasseh, son of Hezekiah, \"built altars for all the host of heaven in the two cour ts of the house of the Lord\" (II Kings 21 : 5). \"For he [Manasseh] built again hi gh places which Hezekiah his father had broken down, and he reared up altars for Baalim, and he made groves, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them\" (II Chronicles 33 : 3). robin-bobin"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"is Ginzberg, Legends, II, 307. 10 See note 1, the Section, \"The Wors hip of Mars.\" Plutarch wrote in Of the Fortune of Romans, Chap.

And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense unto Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all th e host of heaven\" (II Kings 23 : 4-5). The Scriptures do not hide the fact that in Judea, as well as in Israel, the planetary cult was the official cult with the priest s and with kings, with many proph ets and with the people. Thus Jeremiah, contemporary of King Josiah, says: \"At that time, saith the Lord, they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of hi s princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitant s of Jerusalem, out of their graves: and they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the host of heaven, whom they have loved, and whom they have served, and after wh om they have walked, and whom they have sought, and whom they have worshipped\" (Jer emiah 8 : 1-2). And again he says: \"And the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, shall be de filed as the place of Tophet, because of all the houses upon whose roof s they have burned incen se unto all the host of heaven\" (Jeremiah 19 : 13). In the days of Jeremiah and King Josiah, a scroll was found in a chamber of the Temple (II Kings 22). It is generally thought that it wa s the book of Deuteronomy, the last book of the Pentateuch.

Thus we see the centuries-long struggle for the Jewish God, Creator and not unanimated planet, itself a creation, being carried on in the closing d ecades before the exile to Babylon with the help of the book whose authorship was ascribed to Moses. When the people of Jerusalem were exiled to Babylon, and groups of refugees succeeded in escaping to Egypt, taking with them Jeremiah, they said to him: \"But we will certainly . . . burn our incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for then had we plenty of victuals and were well, and saw no evil.

Of this remnant of the people that went to Egypt in the beginning of the sixth century a military colony was established in Ebb (Elephantine) in southern Egypt. Documents (papyri) of this colony were unearthed in the beginni ng of this century. The Jewish colony WORLDS IN COLLISION  297 in Elephantine faithfully worshipped Yahu (Yahwe ), the Lord of the sky, as the theophoric names of many members of the colo ny testify.

The dark tradition that it was the planet Venus that played such an important role in the days when the forebear s of these refugees in Egypt left that land and passed through cataclysms of fire and water, sea and desert, wa s responsible for this syncretism of names. The Jewish people did not obtain all of its \"supremacy\" 2 in that one day at the Mountain of Lawgiving; this people did not receive the messa ge of monotheism as a gift.

Occasionally they may be converted into symptoms of compulsion neuroses and even c ontribute to the splitti ng of the personality. One of the most terrifying events in the past of mankind was the conflagration of the world, accompanied by awful apparitions in the s ky, quaking of the earth, vomiting of lava by thousands of volcanoes, melting of the ground, boili ng of the sea, submersion of continents, a primeval chaos bombarded by flying hot stones, the roaring of the cleft earth, and the loud hissing of tornadoes of cinders. There occurred more than one wo rld conflagration; the most horrible one was in the days of the Exodus. In hundreds of passages in their Bibl e, the Hebrews described what happened. Returning from the Babylonian exile in the sixth and fifth centuries before this era, the Hebrews did not cease to learn and repeat the traditions, but they lost sight of the fearful reality of what they learned.

The talmudists in the beginning of this era disputed whether a deluge of fire, prophesied in old traditions, would take place or not; those who deni ed that it might come, based their argument on the divine promise found in the Book of Genesis, that the Deluge would not be repeated; those who argued to the contrary, reas oning that though the deluge of water would not recur, there might come a deluge of fire, we re attacked for construing too na rrowly the promise of the Lord.1 Both sides overlooked the most prominent part of their traditions: the history of the Exodus and all the passages about the cosm ic catastrophe, endlessly repeated in Exodus, Numbers, and the Prophets, and in the rest of the Scriptures. The Egyptians in the sixth pre-Christian century knew about the catastrophes that overwhelmed other countries. Plato narrates the story which So lon heard in Egypt about the world destroyed in deluges and conflagrations: \"You remember but one deluge, though many catastrophes had occurred previously.\" The Egyptian priests who said this and who maintained that their land was spared on these occasions, forgot what happened to Egypt. When, in the Ptolemaic age, the priest Manetho starts his story of th e invasion of the Hyksos by ack nowledging his ignorance of the cause and nature of the blast of heavenly displeas ure that befell his land, it becomes apparent that the knowledge which was possibly alive in Egypt in the days when Solon and Pythagoras visited there, had already sunk into oblivion in the Ptol emaic age. Only some hazy tradition about a conflagration of the world was repeated, without knowing when or how it occurred. The Egyptian priest, described by Plato as conversing with Solon, supposed that the memory of the catastrophes of fire and flood had been lost because literate men perished in them, together with all the achievements of their culture, and these upheavals \"escaped your notice because for many generations the survivors died with no pow er to express themselves in writing.\" 2 A similar argument is found in > Cf.

Nor did he think that anything of this sort took place in the days of Joshua or even of Isaiah. He thought that the Book of Genesis comprised the story of \"how fire and water wrought great destruction of what is on the earth,\" and that the destruction by fire, about whic h he knew from the teachings of the Greek philosophers, was identical with the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. The memory of the cataclysms was erased, not b ecause of lack of written traditions, but because of some characteristic process that later caused en tire nations, together with their literate men, to read into these traditions a llegories or metaphors where actua lly cosmic disturbances were clearly described. It is a psychological phenomenon in the life of i ndividuals as well as whole nations that the most terrifying events of the past may be forgotten or displaced into the s ubconscious mind.

The legends of classic peoples, first among them th e Greeks, also belong to folklore. As early as pre-Christian times these legends were subjected to interpretati on, many interpreters recognizing the symbolic character of mythology. With Macrobius in the fourth Christian century, there begins a tendency to see in many gods of Egyptian and Greek antiquity the personification of the sun. Macrobi us compared Osiris to the sun, and Isis to the moon, disregarding the opinion of earlier authors. He also interpreted Jupiter as the sun. As the role the planets played in the history of the wo rld retreated ever further into oblivion, the interpretation of nature myths as referring to the sun or the moon became more and more widespread. In the nineteenth cen tury it was the vogue to explai n the old myths as inspired by the movement of the sun and the moon, during the day, night, month, and year. Not only Ra, Amon, Marduk, Phaethon, and even Zeus,1 but also king-heroes, like Oedipus, became solar symbols.2 This exclusive role of sun and moon in mythology is a reflection of their significance in nature. However, in former times the planets played a de cidedly more important role in the imagination of peoples, to which fact their religions give testimony. True, sun and moon (Shamash and Sin, Helios, Apollo, and Selene) were also numbered among the planet-gods, but usually they were not the most important ones. Their enumerati on among the seven planets sometimes startles the modern scholar, because these tw o luminaries are so much more conspicuous than the other planets; the dominance of Saturn, Jupiter, Venus, and Mars must st artle us even more as long as we do not know what was displayed on the celestial scene a few thousand years ago. Modern folklorists occupy themselves mainly with the folklore of primitive peoples, material unspoiled by generations of copyists and 1 In the Phaethon story, Ovid makes it clear th at Sun and Zeus are two separate deities. 2 In a separate work I intend to trace the hist orical prototype of the legend of Oedipus Rex. 302  WORLDS IN COLLISION interpreters. Being received at its source, it is s upposed to shed light not only on the mentality of these primitive peoples, but also on many probl ems of sociology and psychology in general. The sociological method explores mythology for evidence of soci al usages. Folklorists like James Frazer expended their efforts on this aspect. Freud, the psychologist, centered his attention on the motif of father-murder (patricide), presen ting it as though it had b een a regular institution in ancient times. He makes it app ear a general practice in the past and a subconscious urge in present-day man. However, regular institutions and pr actices in the life of the family would not give rise to myths. A writer on this subject has correc tly pointed out this fact: \"What is quite normal in nature and society rarely excites the myth-making imaginat ion which is more likely to be kindled by the abnormal, some startling catas trophe, some terrible violation of the social code.\" 3 Even less than daily tribal life do the daily occurr ences in nature give ri se to legends. The sun rises every morning, it travels from east to we st; the moon enters a new phase four times a month; the year has four seasons—such regular changes do not stir the imagination of peoples, because they contain nothing unexpected in themse lves. Daily things do not evoke astonishment and influence but little a people's creative facu lty. Sunrise and sunset, morning dew and evening mist, are common experiences, and if a single spectacle impresses it self upon us in the course of life, the many sunrises and the many sunsets in ou r memory pale and each looks like the other.

WORLDS IN COLLISION  303 the creation of cosmic myths. First in power to impress the races of the earth are the cataclysms of the past, and on this we have dwelt at length. Comets, because of their causal relation to world catastrophes, and also because of their terrifying appearance, we re the kind of phenomenon to kindle the imagination of peoples. But for some reason, the impression they must have made on the peoples of antiquity is not considered in explanation of myths and legends. Since the invention of the prin ting press, the great agitation and mass hysteria caused by the more brilliant comets can be traced in cont emporary books and pamphlets. Were the ancients immune to these feelings? If not, then why are the exegetes of the Bible and the commentators on the epic compositions of antiquity so remiss as not to think of phenome na that could not but impress the ancients? Or did no co mets appear in the sky during an cient times? This, of course, is only a rhetorical question. Keeping this in mind, we shall be able to answ er the question about the striking similarity of certain concepts among peoples of different cultures, sometimes separated by oceans. Of \"Pre-existing Ideas\" in the Souls of Peoples The similarity of motifs in the folklore of va rious peoples on the five continents and on the islands of the oceans posed a difficult problem for the ethnologists and anthropologists. The migration of ideas may follow the migration of peoples, but how could unusual motifs of folklore reach isolated islands where the aborig ines do not have any means of crossing the sea? And why did not technical civilization travel togeth er with spiritual? Peoples still living in the stone age possess the same, often strange, motifs as the cultured na tions. The particular character of some of the contents of fo lklore makes it impossible to a ssume that it was only by mere chance that the same motifs were created in all corners of the world. The problem is so perplexing to the scientists that, for lack of a better proposition, an explanation was offered according to which the motifs of folklore are a pre-existing possession in the soul of peoples; peoples are born with these ideas just as an animal is born with an urge to propagate 304  WORLDS IN COLLISION its kind, to nurse its offspring, to build a lair or a nest, and to travel in he rds or migrate in flocks to far-away countries. But it is not so simple to explain in these terms why, for instance, the aborigines of America imagined a witch as a woman riding on a broom across the sky, exactly as the European peoples imagined her. \"The Mexi can witch, like her European sister, carried a broom on which she rode through the air, and was associated with the sc reech owl. Indeed, the queen of witches, Tlagoltiotl, is depicted as ri ding on a broom and as wearing the witch's peaked hat.\" ' As with the witch on her broom, so also with hundreds of other odd fantasies and beliefs. The answer to the problem of the similarity of th e motifs in the folklore of various peoples is, in my view, as follows: A great many ideas reflect re al historical content. There is a legend, found all over the world, that a deluge swept over the ea rth and covered hills and even mountains. We have a poor opinion of the mental abilities of our ancestors if we think that merely an extraordinary overflow of the Euphrates so impre ssed the nomads of the desert that they thought the entire world was flooded, and that the legend so born wandered from people to people. At the same time, geological problems of the origin and distribution of till, or diluvial deposit, are awaiting explanation. The peoples of ancient times, who, like the prim itive peoples of the present, lacked modern protection against the elements of nature, and who lived in the in security of tropi cal storms and tornadoes or frost and snowstorms, must have been more accustomed to seasonal disturbances than we are, and would not have been impressed by the overflow of a river to such a degree as to carry their experience to a ll parts of the world as a story of a cosm ic upheaval. robin-bobin"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Traditions about upheavals and catastrophes, fo und among all peoples, are generally discredited because of the shortsighted belief that no forces could have shaped the world in the past that are not at work also at the present time, a belief th at is the very foundation of modern geology and of the theory of evolution. \"Present continuity implies the improbab ility of past catastrophism and violence of change, either in th e lifeless or in the living world; moreover, we seek to interpret 1 Lewis Spence, The History of Atlantis (1930), p. 224.

This was Darwin's secret, learned from Lyell.\" 2 It has been shown in this book, however, that forces which at present do not act on the earth, did so act in historical times, and that these forces are of a purely physical character. Scientific principles do not warrant maintaining that a force which does not act now, could not have acted previousl y. Or must we be in permanent collision with the planets and comets in order to believe in such catastrophes? The Pageants of the Sky Cosmic perturbations took place, catastrophes sw ept the globe, but did witches fly through the air on brooms? The reader would agree that cosmic catastrophes, if they occurred, could leave, and must have left, similar memories all around the world; but there are fantastic images that do not appear to represent realities. We shall follow this rule: if ther e exists a fantastic image that is projected against the sky and that repeats itself all around the worl d, it is most probably an image that was seen on the screen of the sky by many peoples at the same time. On one occasion a comet took the striking form of a woman riding on a broom, and the celestial picture was so clearly defined that the same impression was impo sed on all the peoples of the world. It is well known how, in modern times, the forms of comets impress people. One comet was said to look like \"un crucifix tout sanglant,\" another like a sw ord; actually every comet has its peculiar shape which may also change during the visibility of the comet. To illustrate what is said here by another exampl e, it may be asked: What induced the Mayas to call by the name of Scorpion the constellation kn own to us and to the ancients by the same name? 1 The outlines of this conste llation do not resemble the shape of this insect. It is \"one of the most remarkable coincidences in nomenclature.\" 2 2H. F. Osborn, The Origin and Evolution of Life (1918), p. 24. 1 Sahagun, in the fourth chapter of the seventh b ook of his historical work, says that the people of Mexico called the constellation Scor pion (Scorpio) by this very same name. 2 Seler, Ges. Ahhand. zur amer. Sprach- und Alterthumskunde, II (1903), 622. His surmise, disagreeing with the assertion of De Sahagun, was that Scorpion 306  WORLDS IN COLLISION The constellation, which is not at all like a scorpion, probably wa s called by this name because a comet that looked like a scorpion appeared in it. Actually, we read on one of the Babylonian astronomical tablets that \"a star flared up and its light radiated bright as day, and as it blazed, it lashed its tail like an angry scorpion.\" 3 If it was not this particular appearance of a comet that caused the constellation to be called Scorpion, there must have been a similar occurrence on another date. Another example is the dragon. A ll around the world this image is prominent in literature and art and also in the religion of peoples. There is prob ably no nation that does not use this symbol or this creature as an important motif, yet it does not exist. Several schola rs thought that possibly it represented some extinct menace that impresse d mankind to a much greater degree than any other creature since it appears on the Chinese fl ag, and in pictures showing Archangel Michael or St. George in battle with it, in Egyptian mythology, in Mexican hieroglyphics and bas-reliefs, and in Assyrian bas-reliefs. However, bones of th is presumably extinct reptile have not been found. From the description of the comet Typhon that spr ead like an animal over the sky with its many heads and winged body, with fire flaming from its mouths, as described in a previous chapter by quotations from Apollodorus and others, we reco gnize the origin of this widespread motif. robin-bobin"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"The Subjective Interpretation of th e Events and Their Authenticity What helped to discredit the trad itions of the peoples about the catastrophes was their subjective and magical interpretation of the events.

Because the scientific mind cannot believe that a man can make the sun and the moon to stand still, it disb elieves also the alleged event. What contributes to this is the fact that least of all do we place faith in books that demand belief, religious books, t hough we swear on these. The peoples of the past were prepared to see miracles in unusual occurrences; for this reason modern man, who does not believe in miracles, re jects the event together with the interpretation. But as we find the same event in the traditions of many peoples, and as each people has differently comprehended it, its historicity can be checked, and this in addition to the control offered by natural science. For example, if the geographical poles changed their location, or the axis its inclination, the ancient solar clock would not show the correct time; or, if the magnetic poles became reversed at some time in the past , the lava of earlier volcan ic activity must show reversed magnetic orientation. But there is also a check by folklore. Isaiah foretold to King Hezekiah, probably a few hours before the event, that the shadow of the sundial would return ten degree s. (As we know now, the planet Mars was at that moment very close to the earth, and Isai ah could make an estimate based on experiences during previous perturbations of the earth by Mars.) The Chinese explained this phenomenon as having occurred to help their prin ces in their strategy, or to settle a quarrel among them. The Greek people thought the phenome non was an expression of heavenly wrath at the crime of the Argive tyrants. The Latins thought the phenomenon was an omen associated with Romulus, son of Mars. In the Icelandic epos the same event has a different purpose, in the Finnish epos another, and yet ot hers in Japan and Mexico and Po lynesia. The American Indians say that the sun went backwards several degrees fo r fear of a boy who tried to snare it or because of some animal that terrified it. Precisely becau se there are great differences in the subjective evaluation of the causes or purposes of the phe nomenon, we can assume that the folklore of different peoples deals with one and the same fact ual event, and only the ma gical explanations of the miracle are subjective inventions. Many accomp anying details are preserved in the variants 308  WORLDS IN COLLISION of different peoples, which could not have been invented without an ad equate knowledge of the laws of motion and thermodynamics. It is inconcei vable that the ancients or the primitive races would, for instance, by sheer chance invent the tale that a huge conf lagration enveloped the American prairies and forests as soon as the s un, frightened off by the sn arer, returned a little on its way. If a phenomenon had been similarly described by many peoples, we might suspect that a tale, originating with one people, had spread around the world, and cons equently there is no proof of the authenticity of the event related. But just because one and the same event is embodied in traditions that are very different indeed, its authenticity becomes highly probable, especially if the records of history, ancient charts, sundials, and the physical evidence of natural history testify to the same effect. In the Section \"Venus in the Folklore of the Indians\" a few illustrations were offered to illuminate this thesis. In order to illustrate it with additiona l examples, we choose the nature- folkloristic motif of the sun being arrested in its movement across the firmament in the tales of the Polynesians, Hawaiians, and North American Indians. robin-bobin"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"The best known legend cycle on th e Pacific islands is that which has for its hero the semigod Maui.1 This cycle comprises a trilogy: \"Of the many exploits of Maui three seem to be most widely spread: they are fishing up of the land, sn aring the sun and the quest of fire.\"2 There are two versions of this cycle, one in New Zealand and one in Hawaii, but both are variants of a common tradition. The Hawaiian version of the snaring of the sun runs thus: \"Maui's mother was much troubled by the shortness of the day, occasioned by the ra pid movement of the sun; and since it was impossible to dry properly the sheets of tapa used for clothing, the hero resolved to cut off the legs of the sun, so that he could not travel fast. \"Maui now went off eastward to wh ere the sun climbed daily out of 1 \"Of all the myths from the Polynesian area, pr obably none have been more frequently quoted than those which recount the deed s and adventures of the semi- god Maui.

In one of the versions told in Polynesia about the fishing up of the islands, it is said that a star was used as bait. The following is a tale told by the Menomini Indi ans, an Algonquin tribe.3 \"The little boy made a noose and stretched it across th e path, and when the Sun came to that point the noose caught him around the neck and began to choke him until he almost lost his breath. It became dark, and the Sun called out to the ma'nidos, 'Help me, my brothers, and cut th is string before it kills me.'4 The ma'nidos came, but the thread had so cut into the flesh of the Sun's neck that they could not sever it. When all but one had given up, the Sun cal led to the Mouse to try to cut the string. The Mouse came up and gnawed at the string, but it was difficult work, because the string was hot and deeply imbedded in the Sun's neck. After wo rking at the string a goo d while, however, the Mouse succeeded in cutting it, when the Sun brea thed again and the darkness disappeared. If the Mouse had not succeeded, the Sun would have died.\" The story about snaring the sun associates itself in our mind with one of the occasions when the sun was disrupted in its movement across the sk y. The story contains an important detail and enables us to understand a natural phenomenon. In a previous section we discusse d the various versions of the anni hilation of Sennacherib's army and the physical phenomena which caused it. Accord ing to the Scriptures, in the days of Isaiah the sun was interrupted in its cour se, turning back ten degrees on the 3 Hoffman, Report of the Bureau of Am erican Ethnology, XIV, 181, reproduced by S.

That night the army of Sennacherib was destroyed by a blast. In Egypt this victory over the common enemy of the Jews and the Egyptians was observed in a festival at Letopolis, \"the city of the thunderbolt\"; the holy animal of the city was a mouse, and bronze mice inscribed with the prayers of pilgrims are found in its soil. He rodotus saw there a statue of a god with a mouse in his hand, commemorating the annihilation of th e army of Sennacherib. The story he heard gave as the cause of the event an invasion of mice that gnawed th e strings of the bows. He also told the story of the changed movements of the sun directly following the record of the destruction of the Assyrian arm y. We recogn ized that the imag e of the mouse must have had some relation to the cosmic drama. The best we could do was to interpret the mouse as a symbol of a simultaneous plague, exemplified by the illness of King Hezekiah. robin-bobin"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"The tale of the Indians that combines the snaring of the sun with the deed of the mouse explains the relation of these two elements to each other. Apparently the atmosphere of the celestial body that appeared in the darkness and was illuminate d took on the elongated form of a mouse. This explains why the blast that destroyed the army of Sennacherib was commemorated by the emblem of a mouse. The Indian tale grew from the picture on the celestial screen where a great mouse freed the snared sun. Thus we see how a folk story of the primitives can solve an unsettled problem between Isaiah and Herodotus. A four-legged animal in the sky approaching the sun was visualized as a mouse by the Egyptians and the Menomini Indians. In the tale of the s outhern Ute Indians, the cottontail is the animal that is connected with the disrup tion of the movement of the sun.5 He went to the east with the intention of breaking the sun in pieces. There he waited for the sun to rise. \"The sun began to rise, but seeing the cottontail, it went down agai n. Then it rose slowly again and did not notice the animal. He struck the sun with his club, breaking off a piece, which touched the ground and set fire to the world. 5R. H. Lowie, \"Shoshonean Tales,\" Journal of American Folk-lore, XXXVII (1924), 61 ff.

The river said, 'No, I cannot save you; I'll boil and you will get boiled.'\" On the plain, Cottontail ran through the weed, but th e fire came very close, the weed burned and fell on his neck, \"where cotto ntails are yellow now.\" \"From everywhere he saw smoke rising. He walked a little way on the hot ground and one of his legs was burned up to the knee; before that he had been long-legged. He walked on two legs, and one of them burned off. He jumped on one till that also burned off.\" In this version of the attack on the sun, two points worthy of mention are the world fire following the disruption in the movement of the sun, and th e change in the world of animals accompanied by strong mutations. In the section, \"Phaethon,\" we wondered how the Roman poet Ovid could have known of the relation between the interrupted move ment of the sun and a world fire unless such a catastrophe had really oc curred. The same reasoning applies to the Indians. The story of snaring the sun or attacking the s un is told in many variants, but the world fire is a consistent result. Forests and fields burn, mountains smoke and vomit lava, rivers boil, caves in the mountains collapse, and rocks burst when the sun peeps above the horizon and then disappears and again comes over the horizon. There is one instance more in the Indian story of the sun being impeded on its path and the ensuing world conflagration. Before the catastr ophe, \"the sun used to go round close to the ground.\" The purpose of the attack on the sun was to make \"the sun shine a little longer: The days are too short.\" After the cata strophe \"the days became longer.\" The ancestors of the Shoshonean In dians, a tribe of Utah, Colora do, and Nevada, appear to have lived in the days of Sennacherib and Hezekiah at such a longitude that the sun was just on the eastern horizon when it change d its direction and went back and then came up again.

The moon, being smaller than Mars, would have b een greatly influenced by Mars if it came close enough to that planet.

Some of these changes could be traced if a chart of th e sky, drawn in a period prior to —687, could be examined. Such a chart does exist; it is painte d on the ceiling of the tomb of Senmut, the Egyptian vizier. As explained previously,1 the to mb dates from a time following the Exodus but before the days of Amos and Isaiah. The charts of Senmut show the sky over Egypt at two different epochs: one of them depicts the sky of Egypt before the poles were interchanged probably in the catastroph e that terminated the Middle Kingdom; the other represents the sky of Egypt in the lifetime of Senmut. The first chart startled the investigat ors because in it 1 See the Section \"East and West.\" 312 WORLDS IN COLLISION  313 west and east are reversed. Their judgment of the other chart, in which west and east are not reversed, is as follows: \"It is surprising to find that the celestial charts which have been preserved until our time did not correspond to direct observations, nor to the calcul ations made at the moment of erection of the monument on which these ch arts are pictured.\" 2 Modern astronomy does not admit, or even consider , the possibility that at some historical time east and west as well as south and north were reversed. Consequently, th e first chart could not have been interpreted at all. Th e other chart, with its displaced constellatio ns, suggested to the author of the above quotation that it depicted some more ancient tradition. The only change, according to modern astronomy, comes from th e precession of the equinoxes or the slow movement of the polar axis which describes a circ le in the course of a bout twenty-six thousand years. The computation of the precession is insu fficient by far to explain the position of the constellations on the chart if we rely on the conventional chronology (and even more so if we follow the revised chronology, which brings the ag e of Senmut and Queen Hatshepsut closer to modern times). The changes in the geographical position and co smic direction of the poles caused by the catastrophes of the eighth and seventh centuri es, as well as those brought about by the catastrophes of the fifteenth century, can be studied with the help of the astronomical charts of Senmut. According to Seneca the Great Bear had been the polar constellation. After a cosmic upheaval shifted the sky, a star of the Li ttle Bear became the polar star. Hindu astronomical tablets composed by the Brahma ns in the first half of the first millennium before the present era show a uniform deviation from the expected positio n of the stars at the time the observations were made (the precession of the equinoxes being taken 2 A. Pogo, \"Astronomie Ј gyptienne du tombeau de Senmout,\" Chronique d'Egypte, 1931. 314  WORLDS IN COLLISION into consideration).3 Modern schol ars wondered at this, in their opinion ine xplicable, error. In view of the geometrical methods employed by Hindu astronomy and its detailed method of calculation, a mistake in observati on equal to even a fraction of a degree would be difficult to account for. In Jaiminiya-Upanisad-Brahmana it is written th at the center of the sky, or the point around which the firmament revolves, is in the Great Bear.4 This is the same statement we found in Thyestes of Seneca. In Egypt, too, \"the Great Bear played the part of the Pole Star.\" 5 \"The Great Bear never set.\"6 Could it be that the precession of e quinoxes shifted the direction of th e axis so that, three or four thousand years ago, the polar star was among the stars of the Great Bear? 7 No. If the earth moved all the time as it moves now, four thousand years ago the star nearest the North Pole must robin-bobin"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"have been a-Draconis.8 The change was sudden; the Great Bear \"came bowing down.\"9 In the Hindu sources it is said that the earth receded from its wonted place by 100 yojanas,10 a yojana being five to nine miles. Thus the displacement was estimated at from 500 to 900 miles. The origin of the polar star is told in many tr aditions all over the world. The Hindus of the Vedas worshiped the polar star, Dhrura, \"the fixed\" or \"immovable.\" In the Pura nas it is narrated how Dhrura became the polar star. The Lapps venerate the polar star and be lieve that if it should leave its place, the earth would be destroyed in a great confla gration.11 The same belief is found among the North American Indians.12 3 J.

WORLDS IN COLLISION  315 The day on which the shortest shadow is cast at noon is the day of the summer solstice; the longest shadow at noon is cast on the day of the winter solstice. This method of determining the seasons by measuring the length of the shadows was applied in ancient China, as well as in other countries. We possess the Chinese records of the longest an d shortest shadows at noontime. These records are attributed to —1100. \"But the shortest and the longest shadows recorded do not really represent the true lengths at pr esent.\" 13 The old Chinese charts record the longest day with a duration which \"does not represent the various geographical latitude s of their observatories,\" and therefore the figures are supposed to have been those of Babylonia, borrowed by ancient Chinese, a rather unusual conjecture.14 The length of the longest day in a year depends on the latitude, or the distance from the pole, and is different at different places. Gnomons or sundials can be built with great precision.15 The Babylonian astronomical tablets of the eight h century provide exact data, according to which the longest day at Babylon was equal to 14 hours 24 minutes, whereas the modern determination is 14 hours 10 minutes and 54 seconds. \"The difference between the two fi gures is too great to be attri butable to refraction, which makes the sun still visible over the hor izon after it has set. Thus, the greater length of the day corresponds to latitude 34° 57', and points to a place 2/2° further to the north; we stand therefore before a strange riddle [vor eine m merkwiirdigen Ratsel].

Claudius Ptolemy, who, in his Almagest, made computation for contemporaneous and ancient Babylon, arrived at two different es timates of the longest day at th at city, and consequently of the latitude at which it was lo cated,17 one of his estimates being practically of the present-day value, the other coinci ding with the figure of the ancient Babylonian ta bles, 14 hours 24 minutes. The Arabian medieval scholar Arzachel computed from ancient codices that in more ancient times Babylon was situated at a latitude of 35° 0' from the equator, while in later times it was situated more to the south. Johannes Kepler drew attention to this calculation of Arzachel and to the fact that between ancient and modern Babylon there was a difference in latitude.18 Thus Ptolemy, and likewise Arzachel, computed that in historical times Babylon was situated at latitude 35°. Modern scholars arrived at identic al results on the basis of ancient Babylonian computations. \"This much, therefore, is certain : our tables [System II, and I also], and the astronomers mentioned as well, point to a place a bout 35° north latitude.

Diogenes Laer tius repeated the teaching of Leucippus: \"The earth was bent or inclined towa rds the south because the northern regions grew rigid and inflexible by the snow y and cold weather which ensued thereon.\"20 The same idea is found in Plutarch, who quoted the teaching of Democritus: \"The northern regions were ill temperate, but the southern were well; whereby the latter becoming fruitf ul, waxed greater, and, by an overweight, preponderated and inclined the whole that way.\" 21 Empedocles, quoted by Plutarch, taught that the north was bent from its former position, whereupon the northern regions were elevated and the southern depressed. Anaxa goras taught that the pole received a turn and that the world became inclined toward the south. As we have seen, Seneca in Thyestes correctly as cribed the displacement of the pole to a cosmic catastrophe. Temples and Obelisks In classic authors references can be found to the fact that the te mples of the ancient world were built facing the rising sun.1 Orientation toward the sun is, at the same time, orientation toward the visible planets, as all of them travel through the signs of the zodiac or in the ecliptic. The sun changes the point of its rising and setting from one day to an other, and the ecliptic makes a corresponding slow swing from one solstice to a nother. Therefore, for the purposes of accurate observation of whether the terrestrial pole shifte d in a sudden way, it was necessary to build the temple observatories, not simply facing the eas t and the west, but with a device that would permit checking the position of the sun on the days of the vernal and autumnal equinoxes, when the sun rises exactly in the east and sets exactly in the west. 20 This is a translation by Whiston in his New Th eory of the Earth.

The first ray of the equinoctial sun shone through the eastern gate and into the very heart of the Temple.4 There was no sun worship in this arrangement; it was dictated by the events of the past, when the position of the earth, in relation to the rising and setting points of the sun, wa s moved in world catastrophes.

Thus, we have in the foundations of the temples, like that of Eleusis, a record of the changing direction of the terrestrial ax is and the position of the pole; the temple was destroyed by catastrophes and rebuilt each time wi th a different orientation. Besides the temples and their gates, the obelisks al so served the purpose of fixing the direction of east and west, or of sunrise and sunset on equinoctial days.

Th e length of the shadow and its direction would indicate the hour of the day. Obelisks placed in pairs served as a calendar. On the vernal and autumnal equinoxes their shadows would be continuous for the length of the day, the sun rising exactly in the east and setting exactly in the west. That the purpose for which the obelisks were erect ed was to check on the shadow of the sun (and the position of the earth) can be plainl y seen from this passage of Pliny: \"The obelisk [of Sesothis, brought from Egypt] that has been erected in the campus Martins [in Rome] has been applied to a si ngular purpose by the late Emperor Augustus: that of marking the shadow projected by the sun, and so measuring th e length of the days and nights.\" There then follows this remark: \"For nearly the last thirty years, however, the observa tions derived from this dial have been found not to agre e: whether it is that the sun it self has changed its course in consequence of some derangement of the heavenly system; or whether that the whole earth has been in some degree displaced from the center, a thing that, I have heard say, has been remarked in other places as well; or whet her that some earthquake, confined to this city only, has wrenched the dial from its original position; or whether it is that in consequence of the inundations of the Tiber, the foundations of the mass have subsided.\" 12 The passage indicates that Pli ny envisaged every possible cause, not excluding the one known to have occurred in earlier times when, in the languag e of Plutarch, \"the Pole received a turn or inclination,\" or in the words of Ovid, \"Earth sank a little lower than her wonted place.\" The Shadow Clock The poles changed their locations; all latitudes were displaced; the axis changed its direction; the number of days in the year increased 11 Markham, The Incas of Peru, pp. 115, 116. 12 Pliny, Natural History, xxxvi. 15 (transl.

Of course, a sundial or shadow cloc k from before —687 can no longer serve the purpose for which it was devised, but it might we ll be of use in proving our assumption. Such a clock, originating from the period between circa —850 and —720, was found in Faijum in Egypt at latitude 27°. A hor izontal slab with hour marks has at one end a shadow-casting vertical hob.1 This shadow clock cannot show correctly the change of time in Faijum or elsewhere in Egypt. A scholar who investigated its working came to the conclusion that it must have been kept with its head to the east in the forenoon and to the west in the afternoon, and several scholars agreed that this was the way to use the clock. But this arrangement by itself did not make it possible to read the time. \"Since all actual hour shadows lie s ubstantially closer to the hob than the corresponding marks of the instru ment, the shadow-casting edge must have been higher over the shadow-receiving plane than we find it to be. The upper edge cannot be the shadow-caster of the instrument; it must have been on a parallel line above this edge.\" 2 \"The marks were also not made on the basis of actual observations, but must have been taken from some theory or other.\" 3 But, as a critic rem arked, \"this theory implies that at no season of the robin-bobin"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"year did the clock denote the hours correctly, without an hourly alte ration of the height of that part of the instrument which cast the shadow.\" * As the clock has no device to adjust the height of the head, it is improba ble that this hourly manipulation took place.

But if there wa s a clock that could show the hours correctly without adjustment, what purpose did the shadow clock serve? Another explanation has therefore been offere d for the manner in which the Egyptian sundial was used. The author of the new idea supposes th at at some early date (the precession of the equinoxes being taken into consideration) the sha dow clock was used at some latitude in Egypt on the day of the summer solstice. He admits: \"A ccount has, however, not been taken of change in the declination of the sun be tween sunrise and sunset. . . . For other seasons of the year it would be necessary at each hour or each clock reading, either to al ter the height of the hob, or tilt the st't [clock] or both. Indeed, when the sun ha d south declination, and ev en when it had slight north declination, it would always be necessary to do both. The inference is, therefore, that the clock was originally used at or near the time of the summer solstice.\"B The problem of adjustment for each reading once more crops up in this explanation, again requiring some better means of knowing the exact time. The conclusion at which the author of this explanation arrives—that originally the clock was built for a single day in the year—is rather odd and defies the very purpose for which clocks are constructed. And even if a clock were to be read only once a year, the author of this theory could not make the specimen found in Faijum work, but only a similar clock that had been found broken in piece s; and this he could do only by having recourse to the precession of the equinoxes and by referrin g the clock to a period many hundreds of years earlier than chronolo-gists assume. The shadow clock found at Faijum, built under the Libyan Dynasty, between about —850 and — 720 before the present era, may help us to learn the length of the day, the inclination of the pole to the ecliptic, and the latitudes of Egypt in that historical peri od. A change in any of these three factors would have made the clock obsolete as an instrument for time r eading, and probably all three factors did change. We do not possess the sundial of King Ahaz, but we do have the s Ibid. WORLDS IN COLLISION  323 shadow clock used in Egypt in the period before the last catastrophe of —687 and possibly before the catastrophe of —747. The Water Clock Besides the gnomon or sundial, the Egyptians us ed the water clock, which had the advantage over the former of showing time during the night as well as during the day. A complete example was found in the Amon Temple of Karnak (Thebes), 25.5° north of the equator. This water clock dates from the time of Amenhotep III of the Eighteenth Dynasty, father of Ikhnaton. The jar has an opening through whic h water flows out; marks are incised on the inner surface of the jar to indicate the time. Since the Egyp tian day was divided into hours which changed in length with the length of the day, the jar has different se ts of markings for the various seasons of the year. Four time points are prom inently important: the autumnal equinox, the winter solstice, the vernal equinox, and the summer solstice. The equinoxes have equal days and robin-bobin"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"nights in all latitudes. But on the solstices, when either the day or the night is the longest of the year, the length of the daylight varies with the la titude: the farther from the equator, the greater is the difference between the day a nd the night on the day of the solstice. This difference also depends on the inclination of the e quator to the plane of the orbit or ecliptic, which is at present 23/2°. Should this inclination ch ange, or in other words, shoul d the polar axis change its astronomical position (direction), or should the po lar axis change its ge ographical position with each pole shifting to another point, the length of the day and night (on any day except the equinoxes) would change, too. The water clock of Amenhotep III presented its investigator with a very strange time scale.1 Calculating the length of the da y of the winter solstice, he fo und that the clock was constructed for a day of 11 hours 18 minutes, whereas the day of the solstice at 25° north latitude is 10 hours 26 minutes, a difference of fifty- two minutes. Similarly, the build er of the clock reckoned the night of the winter 1 L. Borchardt, Die altagyptische Zeitrechnung (1920), pp. 6-25. 324  WORLDS IN COLLISION solstice to be 12 hours 42 minutes, whereas it is 13 hours 34 minutes— fifty-two minutes too short. On the summer solstice, the longest day, the clock anticipated a day of 12 hours 48 minutes, whereas it is 13 hours and 41 minutes, and a night of 11 hours 12 minutes, whereas it is 10 hours 19 minutes. On the vernal and autumnal equinoxes the day is 11 hours a nd 56 minutes long, and the clock actually shows 11 hours and 56 minutes; the ni ght is 12 hours 4 minutes long, and the clock shows exactly 12 hours 4 minutes. The difference between the present values and th e values of the day for which the clock is adjusted is very consistent: on th e winter solstice the day of the cl ock is fifty-two minutes longer than the present day of the winter solstice in Ka rnak, and the night is fi fty-two minutes shorter; on the summer solstice the day is fifty-three minut es shorter on the clock and the night fifty-three minutes longer. The figures on the clock show a smaller diffe rence between the length of daylight on the solstices or between the longest a nd the shortest days of the year than is observed at Karnak at the present time. Thus the water clock of Amenhotep III, if it was correctly built and correctly interpreted, indicates that either Thebes was closer to the equator or that the inclination of the equator toward the ecliptic was less than the presen t angle of 23/2°. In either case the climate of the latitudes of Egypt could not have been the same as it is in our age. As we find from the present research, the clock of Amenhotep III became obsolete in the middle of the eighth century; and the clock that might ha ve replaced it at that time would have been made obsolete in the catastrophes of the end of the eighth and the beginning of the seventh centuries, when once more the axis changed its direction in the sky a nd its position on the globe as well.

No k nown astronomical or geological law requires the present direction of the axis and the present positi on of the pole. I find a similar thought in the writings of Schiaparelli: \"The permanence of the geographical poles in the very same regions of the Earth cannot yet be consider ed as in-contestably established by astronomical or mechanical arguments.

Northwestern Europe is well within the circle; some distance behind the Ural Mountains, the line curves toward the north and cr osses the present polar circle. Now we reflect: Was not the North Pole at some time in the past 20° or more distant from the point it now occupies—and closer to America? In like manner, the old South Pole would have been roughly the same 20° from the present pole.2 The Brahman charts of the sky show a large difference from what modern astronomers would expect to find. Calcutta being removed 180° l ongitude from Baffin Land, the Brahman charts would rather correspond to a position of the earth in which the axis would pierce the globe at Baffin Land, close to the present magnetic pole. Th e change in latitude of other regions to the west and to the east of Indi a would have been smaller. It is probable that twenty-seven centuries ago, or perhaps thirty-f ive, the present North Pole was at Baffin Land or close to the Boothia Fe lix Peninsula of the American mainland.

CHAPTER 8 The Year of 360 Days PRIOR to the last series of cataclysms, when, as we assume, the globe spun on an axis pointed in a different direction in space, with its poles at a different location, on a di fferent orbit, the year could not have been the same as it has been since. Numerous evidences are preserved which prove that prior to the y ear of 365J» days, the year was only 360 days long.

In the period of time between the last of the series of catastrophe s of the fifteenth century and the first in the series of catastrophes of the ei ghth century, the duration of a seasonal revolution appears to have been 360 days.1 In order to substantiate my stat ement, I invite the reader on a world-wide journey. We start in India. The texts of the Veda period know a year of onl y 360 days. \"All Veda texts speak uniformly and exclusively of a year of 360 days.

Whiston, in New Theory of the Earth (1696), expressed his belief that before the Deluge the year was composed of 360 days. He found refere nces in classic authors to a year of 360 days, and as he recognized only one major catastrophe, th e Deluge, he related th ese references to the antediluvian era. 2 Thibaut, \"Astronomie, Astrologie und Mathematik,\" Grundriss der indo-arischen Philologie und Alterthumskunde (1899), III, 7. 330 WORLDS IN COLLISION  331 consists of 360 days, nowhere refer to the five or six days that actually are a part of the solar year.\" 3 This Hindu year of 360 days is divided into tw elve months of thirty days each.4 The texts describe the moon as crescent for fifteen days an d waning for another fifteen days; they also say that the sun moved for six months or 180 days to the north and for the same number of days to the south. The perplexity of scholars at such data in the Brahmanic literature is expressed in the following sentence: \"That these are not conventional inexac t data, but definitely wrong notions, is shown by the passage in Nidana-Sutra, which says that the sun remains 13/3 days in each of the 27 Naksatras, and thus the actual solar year is calculated as 360 days long.\" \"Fifteen days are assigned to each half-moon period; that this is too much is nowhere admitted.\" 5 In their astronomical works, the Brahmans us ed very ingenious geometric methods, and their failure to discern that the year of 360 days was 5M days too short seemed baffling. In ten years such a mistake accumulates to fifty-two days. The author whom I quoted last was forced to conclude that the Brahmans had a \"wholly confused notion of the true length of the year.\" Only in a later period, he said, were the Hindus able to deal with such obvious facts. To the same effect wrote another German author: \"The fact th at a long period of time was necessary to arrive at the formulation of the 365-day year is proved by the existence of the old Hindu 360-day Savana-year and of other forms which appear in the Veda literature.\" 6 Here is a passage from the Aryabhatiya, an ol d Indian work on mathematics and astronomy: \"A year consists of twelve months.

Cleobulus, who was counted among the seven sages of ancient Gr eece, in his famous allegory represents the year as divided in to twelve months of thirty days : the father is one, the sons are twelve, and each of them has thirty daughters.35 From the days of Thales, another of the seven sages, who could predict an eclipse, the Hellenes knew that the year consists of 365 days; Thales was regarded by them as the man who discovered the number of days in the year.

All over the world we find that th ere was at some time the same calendar of 360 days, and that at some later date, about the seventh century before the present era, fi ve days were added at the end of the year, as \"days over the year,\" or \"days of nothing.\" Scholars who investigated the calendars of the Incas of Peru and the Mayas of Yucatan wondered at the calendar of 360 days; so did th e scholars who studied the calendars of the Egyptians, Persians, Hindus, Chaldeans, Assyrians, Hebrews, Chinese, Greeks, or Romans. Most of them, while debating the problem in their ow n field, did not suspect that the same problem turned up in the calendar of every nation of antiquity. Two matters appeared perplexing: a mistake of five and a quarter days in a year could certainly be traced, not only by astronomers, but even by an alphabetic farmers, for in the short span of forty years— a period that a person could readil y observe—the seasons would become displaced by more than two hundred days. The second perplexi ty concerns the length of a month. \"It seems to have been a prevailing opinion among the ancients that a lunation or synodical month lasted thirty days.\"49 In many documents of various peoples , it is said that the month, or the \"moon,\" is equal to thirty days, and that the beginning of such a month coincides with the new moon. Such declarations by ancient astronomers make it clear that there wa s no such thing as a conventional calendar with an admitted error; epigomena.\" He refers to the 360 gods in the \"theology of Orpheus,\" to the 360 eons of the gnostic genii, to the 360 idols before the pal ace of Dairi in Japan, to 360 statues \"surrounding that of Hobal,\" worshiped by the ancient Arabs, to the 360 genii who take possession of the soul after death, \"according to the doctrine of the Christians of St. John,\" to the 360 temples built on the mountain of Lowham in China, and to the wall of 360 stadia \"with which Semiramis surrounded the city\" of Babylon. This material did not convey to its collector the idea that an astronomical year of 360 days had been the reason for the sacredness of the number 360. 49 Medhurst, The Shoo King. 342  WORLDS IN COLLISION as a matter of fact, the existence of an internat ional calendar in those da ys is extremely unlikely. After centuries of open sea lane s and international exchange of ideas, no uniform calendar for the whole world has as yet been devised: the Moslems have a lunar year, based on the movements of the moon, which is systematically adjusted every few years to the solar year by intercalation; many other creeds and peoples have systems of their own containing many vestiges of ancient systems. The reckoning of months as equal to thirty and thirty-one days is also a relic of older systems; the five supplementary days were divided among the old lunar months. But at robin-bobin"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"present the almanac does not ascrib e an interval of thirty days between two lunations or a period of 360 days for twelve lunations. The reason for the universal id entity of time reckoning betwee n the fifteenth and the eighth centuries lay in the actual movement of the ear th on its axis and along its orbit, and in the revolution of the moon, during that historical period. The length of a lunar revolution must have been almost exactly 30 days, and the length of the year apparently did not vary from 360 days by more than a few hours. Then a series of catastrophes occurred that chan ged the axis and the orbit of the earth and the orbit of the moon, and the an cient year, after goi ng through a period marked by disarranged seasons, settled into a \"slow-moving year\" (Seneca) of 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 46 seconds, a lunar month being equal to 29 da ys, 12 hours, 44 minutes, 2.7 seconds, mean synodical period. Disarranged Months As a result of repeated perturbations, the earth changed from an orbit of 360 days' duration to one of 365/4 days, the days probably not being exactly equal in both cases. The month changed from thirty to twenty-nine and a half days. Thes e were the values at th e beginning and at the end of the century of \"the battle of the gods.\" As a result of the perturbations of this century, there were intermediary values of the year and th e month. The length of the year probably ranged between 360 and 365/4 days, but the moon, being a smaller (or WORLDS IN COLLISION  343 weaker) body than the earth, suffered greater pe rturbations from the contacting body, and the intermediate values of the month could ha ve been subjected to greater changes. Plutarch declares that in the ti me of Romulus the people were \"i rrational and irregular in their fixing of the months,\" and reckoned some months at thirty -five days and some at more, \"trying to keep to a year of 360 days,\" and that Numa, Romulus' successor, corrected the irregularities of the calendar and also changed th e order of the months. This statement suggests the question: Might it not have been that during the pe riod between consecutive catastrophes the moon receded to an orbit of thirty-five or thirty-six days' duration? If, in the period of confusion, the moon actually changed for a while to such an orbit, it must have been an ellipse or a circle of a radius larger than before. In the latter case, each of the four moon phases must have been of nine days' duration. It is of interest, therefore, to read that in many sagas dealing with the moon, the number nine is used in measures of time.1 A series of scholars found that nine days was for a while a time period of many ancient peoples: the Hindus, the Persians,2 the Raby-lonians,3 th e Egyptians,4 and the Chinese.5 In religious traditions, literature, and astrological works, seven days and nine days compete as the measure of the month's quarter. In the time of the Homeric epic s, the nine-day week became pr evalent in the Greek world. The seven-day week and the nine-day 1 \"The number nine occurs conspicuously in so many sagas which, for other reasons, I recognized to be moon sagas, that I am convinced that the holiness of this number has its origin in its very ancient application in time division.\" Th e author of this passage (E. Siecke, Die Liebesgeschichte des Himmels, Vnter-suchunge n zur indogermanischen Sagenkunde [1892]) did not suppose a change in the nature of the lunar cy cles, and also was not aware of the work of the scholar referred to in the fo llowing footnote, yet he was forced to believe that nine was connected with a time subdivision of a month. 2 A.

Therefore, and in view of the vast material from many peoples, we conclude that at one time during the century of perturbations, for a peri od between two catastrophes, the moon receded to an orbit of thirty-five to thirty-six days' durati on. It remained on such an orbit for a few decades until, at the next upheaval, it was carried to an orbit of twenty-nine and a half days' duration, on which it has proceeded since then. These \"perturbed months\" occurred in the second half of the eighth century, at the beginning of Roman history.11 What is more, we have 6 Roscher, Die Sieben- und Neunzahl im Kultus und Myihus der Griechen, ibid., Vol. XXIV, No. 1 (1904): \"Die beiden Arten von Fristen schon bei Homer und ebenso auch im altesten Kultus nebeneinander vorkommen\" (p. 54). \"In de r Zeit des alteren Epos herrschend gewordene 9-tagige Woche\" (p. 73). 7 Cf.

But the phases of the moon change according to the synodical month of 29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes; after a synodical month the moon returns to the same posit ion in relation to die sun as viewed from the earth. 11 It was probably these changes that caused the gods in The Clouds of Aristophanes to accuse the moon of having brought disord er in the calendar and in th e cult.

The last change was simultaneous with the change of the terrestrial orbit to one of 365% days' duration. Years of Ten Months When the month was about thirty-six days a nd the year between 360 and 365/4 days, the year must have been composed of only ten months. This was the case. According to many classical authors, in the days of Romulus the year co nsisted of ten months, and in the time of Numa, his successor, two months were adde d: January and February. Ovid writes: \"When the founder of the city [Rome] was se tting the calendar in order, he ordained that there should be twice five months in his year. . . . He gave his laws to regulate the year. The month of Mars was the first, and that of Ve nus the second. . . . But Numa overlooked not Janus and the ancestral shades [February] and so to the ancient months he prefixed two.\" 1 Geminus, a Greek astronomer of the first century be fore the present era, says similarly that it was Romulus who (in the eighth century) established the year of ten months.2 Aulus Gellius, a second century author, writes in his Attic Nights: \"The year was composed not of twelve months, but of ten.\"3 Plutarch remarks that in his day th ere was a belief that the Romans, in the time of Romulus, computed the year \"not in twelve mont hs, but in ten, by adding more than thirty days robin-bobin"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"to some of the months.\"4 At the beginning of Numa's reign the ten-month year was still the official one.5 \"March was considered the first month until the reign of Numa, the full year before 12 Kugler, Babylonische Zeitordnung, p. 191, note, i Ovid Fasti i. 27 ff. 2 Geminus, \"Introduction aux phenomenes\" in Petau, Uranologion (1630). 3 Aulus Gellius Nodes Atticae iii. 16. 4 Plut arch, The Roman Questions, xix. 5 Eutropius Brcvarium return rornanorum i. 3 says: \"Numa Po mpilius divided the year into ten months.\" This must refer to the beginning of Numa's reign, when the calendar of Romulus was still valid. 346  WORLDS IN COLLISION that time containing ten months,\" wrote Procopius of Caesarea, who lived in the closing years of the Roman Empire.6 The fact that, in Romulus' time, the first month was named in honor of Mars and the second in honor of Venus shows the importance of these two deities in that period of history. July was named Quintilis (the fifth). The difference of tw o months still survives in the names September, October, November, and Dece mber, which denote the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth months, but according to present-day reckoning they are the ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth months, respectively. Not only was the year divided into fewer than twel ve months, but also the zodiac, or the path of the sun and the moon across the firmament, at pres ent consisting of twelve signs, at one time had eleven and at another time ten signs. A zodiac of fewer than tw elve signs was employed by the astrologers of Rabylonia, ancient Greece, and ot her countries.7 A Jewish song in the Aramaic language which is included in th e Seder Service refers to eleven constellations of the Zodiac. The calendars of the primitive peoples disclose their early origin by the fact that many of them are composed of ten months, and some of eleven months. If the time of the lunar revolution was thirty-five days and some hours, the year was something over ten months long. The Yurak Samoyeds reckon eleven months to th e year.8 The natives of Formosa, too, have a year of eleven months.9 The year of the Kamchada ls is made up of ten months, \"one of which is said to be as long as three.\" 10 The inhabitants of the Kingsmill Islands in the Pacific, also called the Gilbert Islands, near the equator, use a ten-month period for their year.11 In the Marquesas (in Polynesia 6 Procopius of Caesarea, History of the Wars, Bk.

Each year, however, a period of two or three months is not brought into the computation at all, and is omitted in time reckoning.13 The Chams of Indo-China have a calendar of only ten months to the year.14 The natives in some islands of the Indian Ocean also observe ten months to the year.15 The aborigines of New Zealand do not count two months in the ye ar. \"These two months are not in the calendar: they do not reckon them; nor are they in any way accounted for.\"ie \"Among the Yoruba of South Nigeria the thre e months—February, March, April—are generally given no specific name.\"1T These calendars of primitive peoples are similar to the old Roman calendar. They were not invented in disregard of the solar year ('Tears with less than twelve months are to us the strangest robin-bobin"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"of phenomena\"18); their fault is that they are more constant th an the revolution of the earth on her orbit around the sun. The work of adapting the old systems to a new order is still evident in the systems of the aborigines of Kamchatka, South Nigeria, the Dutc h East Indies, and New Zealand. Instead of introducing two additional months, as in th e reform of Numa, one of the months is extended to triple its le ngth, or a period equivalent to two months is not counted at all in the calendric system. The abundance of proofs of the ex istence of a ten-month year is even embarrassing. Since the period when the year was composed of ten months of thirty-five to thirty-six days each was short, how could this ten-month year leave so ma ny vestiges in the calend ar systems all over the world?

We shall trace this period in history in a succeeding volume of this work. The Reforming of the Calendar In the middle of the eighth century the calendar then in use became obsolete. From the year — 747 until the last of the catastrophes on the twen ty-third of March, —687, the solar and lunar movements changed repeatedly, necessitating adju stments of the calendar. Reforms undertaken during this time soon became obsolete in their tu rn, and were replaced by new ones; only after the last catastrophe of —687, when the present world order was established, did the calendar become permanent. Some of the clay tablets of Nineveh found in the royal library of that ci tyx contain astronomical observations made during the period before the present order in the planetary system was established. One tablet fixes the day of the vernal equinox as the sixth of Nisan: \"On the sixth of the month Nisan, the day and night are equal.\" But another tablet places the equinox on the fifteenth of Nisan. \"We cannot explain the difference,\" wrote a scholar.2 Judging by the accurate methods employed and the precision achieved in their observations, the stargazers of Nineveh would not have erred by nine days. In the astronomical tablets of Nineveh \"three sy stems of planets\" are extensively represented; single planets are followed in all their movements in three different schedules. For the movements of the moon there are two different systems.3 Each of these systems is carried out down to the smallest detail, but only the last system of the plan ets and of the moon conforms to the present world order. According to Tablet No. 93, the perihelion, or the poi nt on the earth's orbit th at is nearest the sun, is defined as the twentieth degree 1 The palace of Nineveh was the residen ce of Sargon II, Sennacherib, Esarhaddon, and Assurbanipal. 2 J.

All the numerous data on solar movements in one of the systems lead to one and the same conclusion. \"The solstitial and eq uinoctial points of the ecliptic lay 6° too far to the east.\" 5 \"The distances traveled by the moon on the Chal dean ecliptic from one new moon to the next are, according to Tablet No. 272, on the average 3° 14' too great.\" 6 This means that during a lunar month the moon moved a greater distance in relation to the fixed stars than present observation shows. In Tablet No. 32, the movement of the sun along the zodiac is precisely calculated in degrees, and the station of the sun at the beginning of each lunar month is determined exactly; but it is \"a perplexing presentation of the ununiform movement of the sun. The question is insistent: Why is it that the Babylonians formulated the nonuniformity of the solar movement precisely in this way?\" 7 As the various systems recorded in the astronom ical tablets of Nineveh show, the world order changed repeatedly in the course of a single century. Hence, the Chaldean astronomers had the task of repeatedly readjusting th e calendar. \"From certain passages in the astrological tablets it is easy to see that the calculation of times and season s was one of the chief duties of the astrologers in Mesopotamia.\" 8 The scholars ask: How coul d those men, employed for that very purpose, have made the egregious mistakes recorded in th e tablets, and carried these mistakes over into systems in which the movements of the sun, the moon, and the five planets were recorded with repetitions at regular intervals, these movements and intervals be ing consistently different from those of the presen t celestial order? * Ihid., p. 90.

When the cataclysm of the 23rd of March, —687 brought about another dist urbance in the length of the year and the month, the new standards rema ined uncertain until they could be calculated anew in a series of investigations. From the time of that catastrophe until about the year —669 or —667, no New Year festivals were observed at Babylon.12 \"E ight years under Sennacherib, twelve years under Esarhaddon: for twenty years . . . the New Year's festival was omitted,\" says an ancient chronicle on a clay tablet.13 According to cuneiform inscriptions, in the days of Sargon II a new world age began, and in the days of his son Sennacherib another wo rld age.14 In the days of Assurbanipal, son of Esarhaddon, son of Sennacherib, th e planetary movements, the prece ssion of the equinoxes, and the periodic returns of the eclipse s were recalculated, and these ne w tablets, together with the older ones or copies of the older ones, were stored in the palace library at Nineveh. 9 \"The class of magicians who calculated the le ngth of the months and published information concerning them formed a very important sect ion of the Babylonian and Assyrian priesthood.\" Ibid., p. xxiii. 10 C.

WORLDS IN COLLISION 351 The tablets from Nineveh provide the best possible opportunity to learn how the order of the world changed in the eighth and seventh centuries. Repeated changes in the course of the sun across the firmamen t led the astronomers of Babylonia to distinguish three paths of the sun: the Anu pa th, the Enlil path, and the Ea path. These three paths created much difficulty for the writers on Babylonian astronomy, and many explanations were offered and as many rejected.15 The Anu, Enlil, and Ea paths of the planets across the sky appear to denote the successive ecliptics in various world ages . Like the sun, the planets in different times moved along the Anu, Enlil, and Ea paths. In the Talmudie a number of scattered passages d eal with a calendric change made by Hezekiah. The Talmud was written about a thousand years afte r Hezekiah, and not all details of the reform are preserved; it states that H ezekiah doubled the month of Nisan. In later times, in order to adjust the lunar year to the solar year, an intercalary month was added every few years by doubling the last month of the year, Adar. This system of an intercalary Adar is preserved in the Hebrew calendar to this day. The rabbis wondered why Hezekiah added another Nisa n (the first month). The story is told in the Scriptures that Hezekiah, instead of celebra ting Passover in the first month, put off the feast to the second month.17 The Talmud explains that it was not the second month, but an additional Nisan. It must be noted that in Judea in the days of Hezekiah the months were not called by Babylonian names, and therefore the situation should be stat ed as follows: Hezekiah, after the death of Ahaz, and before the second invasion of Sennacherib, added a month and postponed the feast of Passover. According to the Talmud this was done to make the lunar year correspond more closely to the solar year. As 15 Bezold, Zenit und Aequatorialgestirne am ba bylonischen Fixsternhimm el (1913), p. 6; M.

What permanent changes Hezekiah introduced in the calendar is not stated, but it is apparent that at that time calendar reckoning became a compli cated matter. As Moses in his day \"could not understand how to compute the calendar until God showed him the movements of the moon plainly,\" so in the days of Hezekiah the determ ination of the month a nd of the year became a matter, not of calculation, but of direct obs ervation, and could not be performed much in advance. Isaiah called the astr ologers \"the monthly prognosticato rs.\"1S \\ As we have already said, there is in the Talmud19 the information th at the Temple of Solomon was built so that on the equinoctial days of the year the direction of the rays of the rising sun could be tested.

The eastern gate of the Temple of Jerusalem wa s no longer correctly orie nted after the cardinal points had become displaced. On his accession to the throne following the death of Ahaz, Hezekiah \"inaugurated a sweeping religious reform ation.\"22 II Chronicles 29 : 3 ff. says: \"He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of the Lord, and repaired them.\" Apparently the natural changes in terrestrial rotation which took place in the days of Uzziah and again on the day of the burial of Ahaz, necessitated a reform. Hezekiah therefore gathered the priests \"i nto the east street\" and spoke to them, saying that \"our fathers have trespassed\" and \"have shut up the doors of the porch.\" In the pre-Exilic period it was held \"to be of impe rative necessity that on tw o days of the year the sun shone directly through the eastern gate,\" and \"through all th e eastern gates of the Temple arranged in line, directly into the very heart of the Temple pr oper.\" 2S The eastern gate, also called \"sun gate,\" served not only to check on th e equinoxes, when the su n rises exactly in the east, but on the solstices as well: a device on the eastern gate was designe d to reflect the first rays of the sun on the summer and winter solstices , when the sun rises in the southeast and the northeast, respectively. According to Talmudic aut horities, the early prophe ts experienced much difficulty in making this arrangement work.24 From biblical times vestiges of three calendar systems remain,25 and this assumes a special interest in view of the fact we noted some pages back, namel y, that the tablets from Nineveh record three different systems of solar and plan etary movements, each of which is complete in itself and differs from th e others at every point.

Calendric changes in India were effected in the seventh century: at that time, as in China also, the ten-month year was supplanted by a twelve-month year.29 In the eighth century a calendar reform was ma de in Egypt. We have already referred to a cataclysm during the rei gn of the Pharaoh Osorkon II of the Libyan Dynasty; a nother disturbance of a cosmic nature took place a few decades la ter, still in the time of the Libyan Dynasty.

At the end of the eighth or the beginning of the seventh century before th e present era, the people of Rome introduced a calendar reform. In the pre ceding section we referred to Ovid's statement in Fasti concerning the reform of Romulus, who divided the year into ten months, and the reform robin-bobin"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"of Numa, who \"prefixed\" two m onths. Plutarch's \"Life of Numa\" contains the following passage, part of which has already been quoted: \"He [Numa] applied himself, also, to the adjustment of the calendar, not with exactness, and yet not altogether withou t careful observation. For during the reign of Romulus, they had been irrational and irregular in their fixing of the months, reckoning some at less than twenty days, some at thirty-five, and some at more; they had no idea of the inequality in the annual motions of the sun and moon, but he ld to the principle only, that the year should consist of three hundred and sixty days.\" 35 Numa reformed the calendar, and the \"correction of the inequality which he made was destined to require other and grea ter corrections in the future. He also changed the order of the months.\" 38 Numa was a contemporary of Hezekiah.37 In the second half of the seventh century before the present era, the length of the new month and the new year was calculated by the Greeks. Diogenes Laertius regarded Thales the Milesian, one of the \"seven sages of antiquity,\" as the man who discovered the number of days in the year and the length of the seasons. In his Life of Thales he wrote: \"He was the first to determine the sun's course from solstice to 34 P. Jensen, Die Kosmologie der Babylonier, p. 39. 35 Plutarch, Lives, \"The Life of Numa\" (transl.

If the natural year always was what it is now, it is very strange that this discovery should have been attributed to a sage who liv ed as late as the seventh centu ry, when Egypt and Assyria were already very old kingdoms, and wh en the dynasty of David was in its last decades. The longest and shortest days of the year, a nd thus the length of the year, are easily determined by the length of the shadow. Thales is said to have been born in the first year of the thirty-fifth Olympiad or — 640. The progress of culture would hardly leave to one and the sa me person the calculation of the days in a year, which is a simple matter, and the calculation of forthcoming eclipses, which is an advanced achievement. Similarly, the fact, as stated by Plutarch and Diogenes Laertius, that Solon, another sage of the same period, adjusted the months to the motion of the moon after finding that the time from one new moon to another is half a day shorter than thirty days, must be understood as an adjustment of the calendar to the new order in nature. The span of time from one new moon to another is a natural time division, almost as easily observable as day and night; primitive peoples, unable to read and write, know that the period is less than thirty days. On the other side of the globe, the people of Peru reckoned time from the day of the last cataclysm, and this method of computation was in use when the Europeans reached that country in the beginning of the sixteenth century.40 After the last cataclysm, the times and the s easons were computed anew.

The ancients were interested to know whether the moon had human settlements, but moderns are concerned with the problem of the origin of the lunar craters. There are two theories: one sees in them great ex tinct volcanoes; the othe r, formations produced by the bombardment of great meteorites on the se miliquid mass of the moon before it solidified. There are more than thirty thousa nd such craters, small and large. Some of these circular crests rise as high as 20,000 feet above the plain—their height is me asured by the length of their shadows; some, like Clavius near the moon's south pole, are one hundred and fifty miles in diameter. This tremendous width surpasses anyt hing comparable among volcanoes on earth. It is therefore questioned whether these circular mount ain formations represent true volcanoes. The largest known crater produced by the impact of a body that fell on the 360 WORLDS IN COLLISION  361 earth is in Arizona; it is four fifths of a mile in diameter and much smaller than the crater formations on the moon. As is readily seen, both theories of lunar craters imply a great ca tastrophic occurrence. For such craters to have been formed, trem endous forces must have acted fr om inside or from without; if these formations were caused by impact on a visc ous mass, great meteors must have come flying from many directions. Bright streaks or \"rays\" up to ten miles wide radiat e from some of the crater s; their origin, too, is not known. There are also clefts, irregular in form, about half a mile wide and of unknown depth. In the cosmic catastrophes described in this book the moon was repeat edly involved. Together with the terrestrial globe it pass ed through the fabric of the gr eat comet of the time of the Exodus, and in the conflicts of the eighth century before the present era, the moon was more than once displaced from its orbit by Mars. During th ese catastrophes the moon's surface flowed with lava and bubbled into great circular formations, which rapidly cooled off in the long lunar night, unprotected by an atmosphere from the coolness of cosmic spaces. In these cosmic collisions or near contacts the surface of the moon wa s also marked with clefts and rifts. The \"play\" of Mars with the moon was regarded by the Greeks and the Romans as a love affair.1 From the Iliad we learn that Aphrodite (the Greek goddess of the moon) was warned by Jupiter- Zeus not to battle Ares-Mars, but to leave this task to Hera -Earth and Pallas Athene, being herself predestined to th e sweet work of love. Interplanetary contacts in the celestial sphere are in some respects similar to congress and germination in the biological world. In these contacts the bodies of th e planets overflow with lava—fertile ground for vegetation—and comets born of such contacts fly across the solar system and rain gases and stones and possibly also spores, germs, or larvae on planets. Thus the notion of the ancients that love affairs we re being carried on among the planetary gods and goddesses is a 1 Mars had near contacts with the moon and with the planet Venus, and as a result of these two \"romances\" the goddess Venus (Aphrodite) became a ssociated in mythology with the moon as well as with the planet of that name. 362  WORLDS IN COLLISION tale for the common people and a philo sophical metaphor for the instructed.

The Planet Mars robin-bobin"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"The planet Mars, at the present time, complete s one revolution around the sun in 687 terrestrial days. Its orbit is entirely outside the earth's orbit, and is an ellipse, like that of the earth, but more stretched out, so that the planet's distance from the sun varies considerably during a revolution. When Mars and the earth are on different sides of the sun, the distance between them rises to over 200,000,000 miles and may reach 248,600,000 miles. From this moment on, as the distance between the two planets diminishes, Mars nightly grows more and more luminous, changing from an inconspicuous point of light to a most br illiant star, brighter than any fixed star. During a period of little more than a y ear, it grows fifty-five times brig hter. Among the planets it exceeds then even Jupiter in brilliance. The earth and Mars approach each other every 78 0 days, this being the synodical period of Mars. But because of the ellipticity of the two orbits and the difference in the direction in which their longer radii are turned, the closeness of Mars an d the earth is not the same at every opposition. At each seventh approach, which occurs every fifteen years, when Mars passes through that part of its orbit which is closest to the sun, and th e earth simultaneously passes the segment of its orbit which is farthest from the sun, the conjuncti on of the two planets is especially close and is \"the favorable opposition.\" These occasions are ea gerly awaited by astronom ers, for no celestial body, WORLDS IN COLLISION  363 with the exception of the moon, is more readily observable than Mars when at \"favorable opposition.\" The distance between Mars and the earth at the oppositions varies from 61,000,000 miles to 35,500,000 miles (\"favorable opposition\"); the distan ce at various times during the period of fifteen years varies greatl y, from 248,600,000 to 35,500,000 miles. Two cosmic disturbances recorded by Hebrew tradition—one on the day when Hezekiah's father, Ahaz, was entombed; the other, when Sennacherib's army invaded Palestine—were separated by a period of fourteen or fifteen years, if the figur e in II Kings 18 : 13 refers to the invasion which ended in the disaster. A seemingly arbitrary period of fifteen years of grace, mentioned in Isaiah 38 : 5 and in II Kings 20 : 6, may also have ha d some relation to the periodicity of the catastrophes. The years -776, -747, -717 or -702, and -687 apparently were years of favorable oppositions of Mars, when perturbations, a regular phenomenon in oppositions, reached catastrophic dimensions. If, because of other reasons, contact between Mars and the earth in the past is admitted, the combined shape of the orbits, w ith points of nearest approach being reached at present every fifteen years, could be regarded as a vestige of a contact or series of contacts at similar intervals in the past between the two plan ets then revolving on curved orb its that were closer to each other. Mars bears a striking resemblance to the earth in the inclination of its axis of rotation to the plane of its orbit and in the period of its diurnal rotation. Whereas the equator of the earth is inclined 23% degrees to the plane of the ecliptic, the equato r of Mars is inclined 24 degrees to the plane of its orbit, a similarity unequaled among other planets in the solar syst em. The mean time of axial rotation of the earth is 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4 seconds, that of Mars 24 hours, 37 minutes, 23 seconds. No other two planets are so alike in the duration of their day, conceding that no conclusive data are available fo r the length of the day on Venus. Is it possible that the axis of rotation and the velocity of ro tation of Mars, stabilized and supported in their pres ent position and rate 364  WORLDS IN COLLISION by certain forces, were influenced originally by the earth at the time of contact? Mars, being small as compared with the earth, influenced to a lesser degree the rotation of the earth and the position of its poles.

From his observatory in Flagstaff, Ariz ona, he believed he discovered wa ter on Mars. He interpreted the polar caps as ice masses; because of the dearth of water, the intelligent beings dug the canals to bring water to desert areas.1 In the early years of the twentie th century, plans were devised to communicate by light signals with the hypothetical men on Mars; according to one plan a series of light-sending stations was to be built into a geometric figure on the planes of Siberia. The figure was to represent the Pythagorean theorem of the relati on of the three sides of a right-angle triangle. If there are intelligent beings on Mars, some writers argued, th ey should be able to notice and interpret the signals; if they are no t intelligent enough to notice the signals and understand their meaning, we should not be so eager to communicate with them. The experiment was not carried out.

If there are any living creatu res on that planet, and if they are endowed with organs of sight, they see a black sky, not a blue one as we do. The atmosphere of Mars was the object of ma ny investigations which produced conflicting and apparently unsatisfactory results. This gaseous envelope is transparent, permitting clear observation on the contours of the planet. Mars' s easonal polar caps are produc ts of distillation: a polar cap disappears when summer a rrives in its hemisphere and reappears in winter. It is not known whether these caps are composed of carbon dioxide or of ice, whether they are clouds floating over polar regions or la yers of coagulated masses. The general question as to the pr esence of water vapor in the atmosphere of Mars was answered in the affirmative by one group of observers (L owell Observatory), and in the negative by another group (Lick Observatory). At present it is regarded as almost certain that there is on Mars only a low absolute content of water vapor, about one-twentie th of that in the atmosphere of the earth. This is the view supported by results announced by astronomers at Mount Wilson Observatory. The observations concerning oxygen in the atmosphere of Mars are somewhat inconclusive; it is generally supposed that oxygen on Mars, if there is any, is less than 0.1 per cent of the oxygen content in the atmosphere of th e earth per unit of surface area.1 The difficulty of a spectral analysis of the atmosphe re of the planets lies in the fact that their light is the reflected light of the sun, and consequently it has in it the spectral picture of the atmosphere of the sun (emission lines of the spectr um), and also in the fact that the atmosphere of the earth, through which this re flected light travels, impresses its own characteristic spectral lines (of absorption) on the 1 W.

One series of clouds is seen in the photographs taken in violet light, but not in those taken in red light; a second series of clouds is seen in the red, but not in the violet, light. In the present study of cosmic catastrophes the endea vor has been to establis h the fact that in the eighth and seventh centuries befo re this era the earth was repeatedly approached by a celestial body; that this body was the planet Mars; that previously Mars had been displaced from its path by contact with Venus, which up to that time had crossed the orbit of th e earth, and that Venus, the earth, and Mars, as a consequence, assumed new positions in the solar system. In all these contacts between Venus, the earth, and Mars ther e was an exchange of atmospheres, the earth acquiring the carbon clouds of Venus and also so me of the atmosphere of Mars. The white precipitated masses on Mars, which form the polar caps, are probably of the nature of carbon, having been acquired from the trailing part of Venus, and only the difference in atmospheric conditions on Mars as compared with the earth, together with a difference in temperature, keeps this \"manna\" from being permanently dissolved under the rays of the sun. The main ingredients of the atmosphere of Mars must be present in the atmosphere of the earth. Mars, \"the god of war,\" must have left part of his property on his visits. As oxygen and water vapor are not the main ingredients of the atmo sphere of Mars, some other elements of the terrestrial atmosphere must be the main componen ts of its atmosphere. It could be nitrogen, but the presence of nitrogen on Mars—or its absence—has not yet been established. WORLDS IN COLLISION  367 Besides oxygen and nitrogen, the main components of the terrestrial a tmosphere, argon and neon are present in detectable quantities in the air. These rare gases excite spectral lines only when in a hot state; consequently, they cannot be detected through lines of emission from a comparatively cool body such as Mars. The abso rption lines of argon and neon have not yet been investigated. When a study of these lines will make possible a spectral search for these rare gases on planets, Mars should be submitted to the test. If analysis should reveal them in rich amounts, this would also answer the quest ion: What contribution did Mars make to the earth when the two planets came into contact? The Thermal Balance of Mars The equatorial diameter of Mars is about 4,200 mile s; when compared with that of the earth, the ratio in volume is 15 to 100; the ratio in mass is supposed to be 10.8 to 100. Mars is one-sixth the volume of Venus, and Venus is considered to be seven and a half times heavier than Mars. Due to the eccentricity of Mars' orbit, the in solation at aphelion is much smaller than at perihelion (the ratio being about 5:6), and in the southern hemis phere the summer is much hotter but much shorter than in the northern hemisphere . Because of the greater mean distance of Mars from the sun, it is supposed to recei ve less than half the light and warmth per unit of area that the earth receives; and for this reason its temperature must be some 65° C. below that of the earth, and never above freezing. The mean temperature of a year on the equatori al latitudes of Mars must be similar to that of the polar regions of the earth. The radiometric measurement of the temperature of Mars actually shows an excess of heat.1 Mars emits more heat than it receives from the sun. Does this excess of heat come from the interior of the planet? Mars is a smaller body than the ea rth; it has more surface per unit of volume, and it must have cooled down quicker than the earth, especially if it was released fr om the nebulous sun by a centrifugal 1 W.

The contacts of Mars with Venus, and in a lesse r degree with the earth, le ss than three thousand years ago probably are responsible for the present temperature of Mars; interplanetary electric discharges could also initiate atomic fissions with ensuing radi oactivity and emission of heat. The Gases of Venus A part of the gaseous trail of Venus remained a ttached to the earth, another part was torn away by Mars, but the main mass of gases followed the h ead of the comet. Of the part which remained with the earth, some became a deposit of petroleu m; some, in the form of clouds, enveloped the earth for many years, slowly precipitating. The part retained by Venus burned or smoked for a long time, as long as the oxygen carried from the earth lasted; what remained forms today the envelope of carbon clouds of th e Morning Star. To the depth penetrated by spectroscopic analysis, oxygen and water vapor are absent. The planet is covered with clouds of dust. Carbon dioxide is an ingredient of Venus' atmosphere.1 The brilliant envelope of Venus is the remnant of its tail of the days when, three thousand years ago, it was a comet. The reflecting power (albedo) of Venus is gr eater than that of any other planet. 1 C. E. St. John and J. B. Nicholson, \"The Spectrum of Venus,\" Contri butions from the Mount Wilson Observatory, No. 249 (1922). The supposition has been advanced that Venus is covered with formaldehyde (R.

WORLDS IN COLLISION 369 It is 0.75 as compared with 0.22 for Mars, and 0.13 for the moon.2 The reflecting capacity of Venus is not only much greater th an that of desert sand, but is almost equal to that of newly fallen snow. On the basis of this research, I assume that Venus must be rich in petroleum gases. If and as long as Venus is too hot for the lique faction of petroleum, the hydro carbons will circulate in gaseous form. The absorption lines of the hydrocarbon spectrum lie far in the infrared where usual photographs do not reach. When the t echnique of photography in the in frared is perfected so that hydrocarbon bands can be differentiated, the spectr ogram of Venus may disclose the presence of hydrocarbon gases in its atmosphere , if these gases lie in the uppe r part of the atmosphere where the rays of the sun penetrate. If the petroleum that poured down on the earth on its contact with the comet Venus was formed by means of electrical discharges from hydr ogen and gaseous carbon, Venus must still have petroleum because of the discharges that passed, as we assume, between the head and tail of the comet when it was intercepted by the earth and in other celestial contacts. Some indirect conclusion can also be drawn concerning the presence of liquid petroleum on Jupiter. If, as is assumed here, Venus was thrown off from Jupiter in a violent expulsion, and if Venus has petroleum gases, then Jupiter must ha ve petroleum. The fact that methane has been discovered in the atmosphere of Jupiter—the on ly known constituents of its atmosphere are the poisonous gases methane and ammonia—makes it rather probable that it has petroleum; the so- called \"natural gas\" found in and near o il fields consists largely of methane. The modern theory of the origin of petrol eum, based upon its polarizing quality, regards petroleum as originating from organic, not inorga nic, matter. Consequently, if I am not mistaken, Venus and Jupiter must possess an organic source of petroleum. On preceding pages it was shown that there are some historical indicati ons that Venus—and therefore also Jupiter—is populated by vermin; this organic life can be the source of petroleum. 2 These figures are from Arrhenius, Das Schicksa l der Planeten (1911), p. 6.

Venus, being nearer to the sun than the earth, turn s in succession its illuminated and shaded parts toward the earth: it shows phases like the moon. The temperature of the day and night sides of Venus was measured by a radiometric method and it was found that there is \"a nearly uniform temperature over the planet's surface both on th e illuminated and dark hemispheres.\" \"This sentence [of E.

The conclusion dr awn was this: The daily rotation of the planet Venus is very rapid and during the short night the temperature cannot fall to any considerable extent. But this conclusion stands in complete contradiction to what was believed to be the established fact of the nonrotati on of Venus (with respect to the sun, or of a rotation in relation to the fixed stars with a period equal to the time of one revolution on its planetary orbit or 225 terrestrial days). Due to the cover of clouds over Venus, it is impossible to have a direct impression as to whether Venus has a day-night ro tation or not. The spectro-graphic data suggest that the planet revolves always with the same side to the sun, just as the moon revolves always with the same side to the eart h, or that, at most, it rotates very slowly.3 In any case, a short period of rotation is exclude d by the spectrographic data. \"If the period of rotation of Venus is 225 days, as many observers 1 F.

The night side of Venus radiates heat because Venus is hot. Th e reflecting, absorbing, insulating, and conducting properties of the cloud layer of Venus modify th e heating effect of the sun upon the body of the planet; but at the bottom of the problem lies this fact: Venus gives off heat. Venus experienced in quick succession its birth and expulsion under violent conditions; an existence as a comet on an ellipse which appro ached the sun closely; two encounters with the earth accompanied by discharges of potentials between these two bodies and with a thermal effect caused by conversion of momentum into heat; a number of contacts with Mars, and probably also with Jupiter. Since all this happened between the third and first millennia before the present era, the core of th e planet Venus must still be ho t. Moreover, if there is oxygen present on Venus, petroleum fires must be burning there. These conclusions are drawn from the history of Venus as established in this research.

Nor is there justification for the excu se that man cannot know or find out how this system came into being because he was not there when it was arranged in its present pattern. Catastrophes have repeatedly reduc ed civilization on this earth to ruins. But our earth has fared well in comparison with Mars; and judged by the state of civ ilization at which mankind has arrived, conditions for life processe s have been improved in some respects. But if events of this kind happened in the past, they may happen again in the future, with pe rhaps a different—fatal— result. The earth has come in contact with other planets and comets. At present no planet has a course that endangers the earth, and only a few asteroid s—mere rocks, a few kilometers in diameter— have orbits that cross the path of the earth. Th is was discovered, to the amazement of scholars, only recently. But in the solar system there exists a possibility that at some date in the future a collision between two planets will occur, not a mere encounter betw een a planet and an asteroid. The orbit of Pluto, the farthest of the planets from the sun, tho ugh much larger than Neptune's, crosses that of Neptune. True, the plane of the orbit of Pluto is inclined 17° to the ecliptic, and therefore the danger of a collision is not impending. However, since the long axis of Pluto's orbit changes its direction, future cont act between the two planets is probable if no comet intervenes to disrupt the intersecting orbits of these bodies. Astronomers will see the planets stop or slow down in their rotation, cushioned in the magnetic fields about them; a spark will fly from one planet to another, and thus an actual crushing co llision of the lithospheres will be avoided; then the planets will part and change their orbits. It may happen that Pluto will become a satellite of Neptune. There is also the possibility that Pluto may encounter, not Neptune, but Triton, Neptune's satellite and about one-third as larg e as Pluto. Whether Pluto will become another moon of Neptune or will be thrown into a position much closer to the sun, or whether it will free Triton from being a satellite are matters of conjecture. Another case of intersection may be found among the moons of Jup iter. The orbit of the sixth satellite is interlocked with the orbit of the seve nth, and the eighth satellit e is highly erratic and crosses WORLDS IN COLLISION  373 the path of the ninth. One should be able to calcu late how long the sixth and seventh satellites have moved on their presen t paths; the figures will probably not be large. Each collision between two planets in the past caused a series of subsequent collisions, in which other planets became involved. The collision between major planets, which is the theme of the sequel to Worlds in Collision, brought about the birth of comets . These comets moved across the orbits of other planets and collid ed with them. At least one of these comets in historical times became a planet (Venus), and this at the cost of great destruction on Mars and on the earth. Planets, thrown off their paths, collided repeatedly until they attained their present positions, where their orbits do not intersect. The only rema ining cases of intersecti on are those of Neptune and Pluto, the satellites of Jupiter, and some planetoids (asteroids) that cross the orbits of Mars and the earth. Moreover, comets may strike the earth, as Ve nus did when it was a comet; in that major catastrophe it was fortunate that Venus is a. slightly smaller body than the earth. A large comet arriving from interstellar spaces may run into one of the planets and push it from its orbit; then chaos may start anew. Also, some dark star, like J upiter or Saturn, may be in the path of the sun, and may be attracted to the system and cause havoc in it. The scholarly world assumed that in some hundreds of millions of years the heat of the sun would be exhausted, and then, as Flam-marion fri ghtened his readers, th e last pair of human beings would freeze to death in the i ce of the equator. But this is far off in the future. In view of modern knowledge that heat is discharged in the process of breaking up atoms, scientists are now prepared to credit the sun with an immense rese rve of heat.

Man can go far in such a span of 374  WORLDS IN COLLISION time, considering that his entire civilization ha s endured less than ten thousand years, and in view of the great technological progress he has made in the last century. The average man is no longer afraid of the e nd of the world. Man clings to his earthly possessions, registers his landholding s and fences them in; peoples carry on wars to preserve and to enlarge their historical frontiers. Yet the last five or six thousand years have witnessed a series of major catastrophes, e ach of which displaced the borders of the seas, and some of which caused sea-beds and continents to interchange places, submerging kingdoms, and creating space for new ones. Cosmic collisions are not divergent phenomena, or phenomena that, in the opinion of some modern philosophers, take place in defiance of what is supposed to be physical laws; they are more in the nature of occurren ces implicit in the dynamics of the universe, or, in terms of that philosophy, convergent phenomena. \"Lest by chance restrained by religion,\"—and we may read 'science' instead of 'religion'—\"you should think that earth and sun, and sky, sea, st ars, and moon must needs abide for everlasting, because of their divine body,\" think of the catas trophes of the past; and then \"look upon seas, and lands, and sky; their threefold nature . . . then-three textures so vast, one single day shall hurl to ruin; and the massive form and fabric of the world held up for many years, shall fall headlong.\"1 \"And the whole firmament shall fall on the divine earth and on tne sea: and then shall flow a ceaseless cataract of raging fire, and shall burn land and sea, and the firmament of heaven and the stars and creation itself it shall cast into one molten mass and clean dissolve.

EPILOGUE EPILOGUE Facing Many Problems IN THIS BOOK, containing the first part of a hi storical cosmology, I have endeavored to show that two series of cosmic catas trophes took place in historical tim es, thirty-four and twenty-six centuries ago, and thus only a short time ago not peace but war reigned in the solar system. All cosmological theories assume that the planet s have revolved m their places for billions of years; we claim that they have been traveling along their pres ent orbits for only a few thousand years. We maintain also that one planet—Venus—was formerly a comet and that it joined the family of planets within the memory of mankind, thus offering an explanation of how one of the planets originated. We conjectured that the comet Ve nus originated in the pl anet Jupiter; then we found that smaller comets were born in contac ts between Venus and Mars, thus offering an explanation of the principle of th e origin of the comets of the solar system. That these comets are only a few thousand years old explains why, despite dissipation of the material of their tails in space, they have not yet disinteg rated entirely. From the fact that Venus was once a comet we robin-bobin"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"learned that comets are not nearly immaterial bodies or \"rien visible, \" as was thought because stars are usually seen th rough their tails and, on the passage of one or two of them in front of the sun, their heads were not perceptible. We claim that the earth's orbit changed more than once and with it the lengt h of the year; that the geographical position of the terre strial axis and its astronomical direction changed repeatedly, and that at a recent date the polar star was in the constellation of the Great Bear. The length of the day altered; the polar regions shifted, 379 380  WORLDS IN COLLISION the polar ice became displaced into moderate lat itudes, and other regions moved into the polar circles. We arrived at the conclusion that electrical discharges took place between Venus, Mars, and the earth when, in very close contacts, their atmosphe res touched each other; that the magnetic poles of the earth became reversed only a few thousand years ago; and that with the change in the moon's orbit, the length of the month changed too, and repeatedly so. In the period of seven hundred years between the middle of the second mille nnium before the present era and the eighth century the year consisted of 360 days and the m onth of almost exactly thirty days, but earlier the day, month, and year were of different lengths. We offered an explanation of the fact that the no cturnal side of Venus emits as much heat as the sunlit side; and we explained the origin of the canal s of Mars and of the craters and seas of lava on the moon as brought about in stress and near collisions. We believe we came close to solving the proble m of mountain building an d the irruption of the sea; the exchange of place between sea and land ; the rise of new isla nds and volcanic activity; sudden changes in climate and the destruction of quadrupeds in northern Siberia and the annihilation of entire species; and the cause of earthquakes. Furthermore, we found that excessive evaporation of water from the surface of the oceans and seas, a phenomenon that was postulated to explai n excessive precipitation and formation of ice covers, was caused by extraterrestrial agents. T hough in such occurrences we see the origin of the Fimbul winter, we are inclined to regard the erratic boulders a nd till, or gravel, clay, and sand on the substratum of rock as having been carried, not by ice, but by onrushing gigantic tides caused by change in the rotation of the terrestr ial globe; thus have we accounted for moraines that migrated from the equator toward higher la titudes and altitudes (Himalayas) or from the equator across Africa to ward the South Pole. We recognized that the religions of the peoples of the world have a common astral origin. The narrative of the Hebrew Bible concerning the plagues and othe r wonders of the time of the Exodus is WORLDS IN COLLISION  381 historically true and th e prodigies recorded have a natural ex planation. We learned that there was a world conflagration and that naphtha poured from the sky; that only a small proportion of people and animals survived; that the passage of the sea and the the-ophany at Mount Sinai are not inventions; that the shadow of death or twilig ht of the gods (Gotterdammerung) refers to the time of the wandering in the desert; that manna or ambrosia really fell from the sky, from the clouds of Venus. We found also that Joshua's mir acle with the sun and the moon is not a tale for the credulous. We learned why there are common ideas in the folk lore of peoples separated by oceans, and we recognized the importance of world upheavals in the content of legends and why the planets were deified and which planet was represented by Pallas Athene, and what is the celestial plot of the Iliad and in what period this epic was crea ted, and why the Roman people made Mars their national god and progenitor of the founders of Rome.

We discerned the cause of the great wanderings of peoples in the fifteen th and eighth centuries. We learne d the origin of the belief in the chosenness of the Jewish people; we traced th e original meaning of the archangels, and the source of eschatological beliefs in doomsday. In giving this enumeration of the claims made and problems dealt with in this book, we are aware that more problems have arisen than have been solved. The question before historical cosmogony is this: If it is true that cosm ic catastrophes occurred such a short time ago, how about the more remo te past? What can we find out concerning the Deluge, at present thought to have been a local flooding of the Euphrates that impressed the Bedouins coming from the desert? In general, what can be br ought to light concerning the world's more distant past a nd earlier celestial battles? As explained in the Preface, the story of catastrophes as they can be reconstructed from the records of man and of nature is not completed in this volume. Here are presented only two chapters—two world ages—Venus and Mars. I inte nd to go further back into the past and piece together the story of some earlier cosmic upheavals. This will be the subject of another volume. There I hope to be able to tell a little more of the circumstances preceding the birth of Venus from the body of Jupiter and narrate at length w hy Jupiter, a planet which only a few persons out of a crowd know how to find in the sky, was the ma in deity of the peoples of antiquity. In that book an attempt will be made to answer some more of the questions raised in the first pages of the Prologue of this volume. Historical cosmogony offers a chance to employ the fact that th ere were catastrophes of global extent in establishing a synchr onized history of the ancient wo rld. Previous efforts to build chronological tables on the basis of astronomi cal calculations—new moons, eclipses, heliacal rising or culmination of certain stars—cannot be correct because the order of nature has changed since ancient times. But great upheavals of cosmic character may serve as points of departure for writing a revised history of the nations. Such a synchronization of the histories of the anci ent world is attempted in Ages in Chaos. Its starting point is the simu ltaneity of physical catas trophes in the countries of the ancient East and the comparison of records referring to such ca tastrophes among the peoples of antiquity. For the rest, I have proceeded by collati ng political records and archeological material of the ancient East covering a period of over a thousand years, from the end of the Middle Kingdom in Egypt to the time of Alexander of Mace donia: going step by step from cen tury to century, the research arrives at an entirely revised se quence of events in ancient histor y and discloses a discrepancy of a number of centuries in the conventional chronology. The development of religion, including the religi on of Israel, comes under a new light. The facts established here may help in tr acing the origin and the growth of planetary worship, animal worship, human sacrifices—also the source of astrological beliefs. The author feel s an obligation to expand the scope of his work in order to include th e problem of the birth of religion and of monotheism WORLDS IN COLLISION  383 in particular. Investigation should be made in to why and how the Jewish people, who had the same experiences as other peoples and who starte d with an astral religion like the rest of the nations, early cast off astral deities and forbade the worship of images. The Scriptures invite a new approach to Bible criticism, one that will make it possible to see the process of transition from an astral religion to monotheism with its idea of a single Creator, not a star, not an animal, and not a human being. An intriguing problem presents itself in psychology. Freud searched for primordial urges in modern man. According to him, in the primitive so ciety of the stone age, when the sons grew up, they looked for a chance to dispose of the fath er, once all-powerful and now aging, and to work their will on their mother; and this urge is part of the heritage that modern man carries over from his prehistoric ancestors. According to the theory of anothe r psychologist, Carl Jung, there exists a collective unconscious mind, a rece ptacle and carrier of ideas deposited there in prim eval robin-bobin"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"times, which plays an important ro le in our concepts and actions. In the light of these theories, we may well wonder to what extent the terr ifying experiences of world catastrophes have become part of the human soul and how much, if a ny, of it can be traced in our beliefs, emotions, and behavior as directed from the uncons cious or subconscious strata of the mind.1 In the present volume geological and paleontolog ical material was discussed only occasionally— when we dealt with rocks being carried consid erable distances and placed on top of foreign formations; with mammoths being killed in a catastrophe; with the changes of climate, the geographical contours of the polar ice in the pa st, moraines in Africa, and remains of human culture in the north of Alaska; w ith the source of a substantial part of oil deposits, the origin of volcanoes, the cause of earthquak es. However, geological, pale ontological, and anthropological material related to the problems of cosmic catastrophes is vast and may give a complete picture of past events no less th an historical material. 1 In connection with my idea of collective amnesia, G. A. Atwater suggests a search for the vestiges of terrifying experiences of the past in the present behavior of man. 384  WORLDS IN COLLISION What can we establish concerning the disappearance of species and ev en of genera, the theory of evolution versus the theory of catastrophic mutations, and the de velopment of animal and plant life in general, or the time when giants lived or when brontosauri populated the earth? The submersion and emersion of land, the origin of the salt in the sea, the origin of deserts, of gravel, of coal deposits in Anta rctica, and the palm growth in th e arctic regions; the building of sedimentary rocks; the intrusion of igneous ro ck above levels contai ning bones of marine and land animals and of iron in the superficial layers of the earth's crust, the times of geological epochs and the age of man on the earth—all these ask for treatment in the light of the theory of cosmic catastrophism. Then there are physical problems. The accounts gi ven in this book about planets changing their orbits and the velocities of their rotation, about a comet that became a planet, about interplanetary contacts and discha rges, indicate a need for a new approach to celestial mechanics. The theory of cosmic catastrophism can, if re quired to do so, conform with the celestial mechanics of Newton. Comets and planets pushi ng one another could change their orbits, although it is singular how, for instance, Venus c ould achieve a circular orbit, or how the moon, also forced from its place, could hold to an almost circular orbit. Nevertheless, there are precedents for such a concept. The planetesim al theory postulates innumerable collisions between small planetesimals—that flew out of the sun, gradually rounded their orbits, and formed planets and satel lites; the tidal theory also regards th e planets as derivatives of the sun swept by a passing star into a direction and with a force that, together with the gravitational attraction of the sun, created nearly circular or bits, the same having occurred to the moons in relation to their parent planets.2 Another precedent for circul ar orbits formed under extraordinary circumstances can be found in the th eory that regards the retrograde 2 One of the authors of the tidal theory, Harold Jeffreys, writes that first among the \"several striking facts\" which \"still remain unexplained\" by the tidal theory is \"the smallness of the eccentricities of the orbits of the planets a nd satellites\" (The Eart h, 2nd ed. [1929], p. 48). WORLDS IN COLLISION  385 satellites as captured asteroids which su cceeded, after being captured, in achieving approximately circular orbits. If such effects from contacts between two star s or from capture of a smaller body by a larger body are not incompatible with celestial mechanics, then the orb its resulting from worlds in collision should be regarded as in harmony with it, too. The physical effects of retardation or reversal of the earth in its diurnal rotation are differently evaluated by various scientists. Some express the opinion that a total destru ction of the earth and volatilization of its entire mass would follow su ch slowing down or stasis. They concede, however, that destruction of such dim ensions would not occur if th e earth continued to rotate and only its axis were tilted out of its position. This could be cau sed by the earth's passing through a robin-bobin"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"strong magnetic field at an angle to the earth's magnetic axis. A rotating steel top, when tilted by a magnet, continues to rotate. Theo retically, the terrestrial axis coul d be tilted for a certain length of time, and at any angle, and also in such a fa shion that it would lie in the plane of the ecliptic. In that case, one of the two hemispheres —the northern or the southern—would remain in prolonged day, the other, in prolonged night. The tilting of the axis could produce the visual effect of a retrogre ssing or arrested sun; a greater tilting, a multiple day or night; and in the case of stil l greater tilting, a reversal of poles with east and west exchanging places; all this without a substantial disruption in the mechanical momentum of the rotation or revolution of the earth. Other scientists maintain that a theoretical sl owing down or even stoppage of the earth in its diurnal rotation would not by itself cause the destruct ion of the earth. All parts of the earth rotate with the same angular velocity, and if the theo retical stoppage or slowi ng down did not upset the equality of the angular velocity of the various parts of the solid globe, the earth would survive the slowing down, or stasis, or ev en a reversal of rotation. Howeve r, the fluid parts—the air and the water of the oceans—would certainly have th eir angular velocity disrupted, and hurricanes and tidal waves would sweep the earth. Civiliza tions would be destroyed, but not the globe. 386  WORLDS IN COLLISION According to this explanation, th e actual results of such a slow ing down of the angular velocity of rotation would depend on the manner in which it occurred. If the applic ation of an external medium, say a thick cloud of dust, acted equally on all parts of the surface of the gl obe, the globe would change its speed of rotation or might even cease rotating, and the energy of its rotation would be transferred to the cloud of dust; heat would develop as the re sult of the bombardment by the particles of dust striking the atmosphere and the ground. The earth would be buried under such a thick layer of dust that its mass would noticeably increase. The cessation of the diurnal ro tation could also be caused—and most efficiently—by the earth's passing through a strong magnetic field; eddy curre nts would be generated in the surface of the earth,3 which in turn would give rise to magnetic fields, and these, interacting with the external field, would slow down the earth or bring it to a rotational stasis. It is possible to calculate the mass of a cloud of particles and al so the strength of the magnetic field that would cause the earth to stop rotating or to slow do wn, say, to half its original rotational velocity. A rou gh calculation shows that if the mass of this cloud were equal to the mass of the earth and consisted of iron particles magnetized close to saturation, it would create a magnetic field strong enough to stop the rotation of the ear th; if the magnetic field were half as strong it would slow the rotation of the earth to half its original veloc ity. However, if the cloud were electrically charged, the strength of its magnetic fiel d would depend on its charge. If the interaction with the magnetic field caused the earth to renew its spinning, it would almost certainly not be renewed at the same speed. If the magma inside the globe continued to rotate at a different angular velocity than th e shell, it would tend to set the ear th rotating slowly. In the tidal theory the origin of the earth's rotation is ascribed to the action of meteorites. 3 In this connection see the description of a sudden calamity in Numbers 16 : 45-49, in which thousands of Israelites roaming in the de sert were \"consumed as in a moment.\" WORLDS IN COLLISION  387 If the angular velocity of the various strata or segments of the globe were disrupted by some stress, these strata or segments would shift, a nd heat would be created as the result of the friction. Cracks and rifts would appear, seas wo uld erupt, land would subm erge or rise in mountain ridges, with \"the midmos t of the earth trembling with te rror and the upper layers of the earth falling away.\" 4 The stresses between the various st rata that would result in all th is might also convert some of the energy of rotation, not into heat, but into other forms of energy, including electrical. A discharge of great magnitude between the earth a nd the outer body (or cloud) could take place in this way. robin-bobin"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Thus celestial mechanics does not conflict with cosmic catastro-phism. I must admit, however, that in searching for the causes of the great upheavals of the past and in considering their effects, I became skeptical of the great theories concerni ng the celestial motions that were formulated when the historical facts described here were no t known to science. The subject deserves to be discussed in detail and quantitative ly. All that I would venture to say at this time and in this place is the following: The accepted celestial mechanics, notwithstanding the many calculations that have been carried out to many decimal places, or verified by celestial motions, stands only if the sun, the source of light, warmth, and other radiat ion produced by fusion and fission of atoms, is as a whole an electrically neutra l body, and also if the planets, in their usual orbits, are neutral bodies. Fundamental principles in celes tial mechanics including the law of gravitation, must come into question if the sun possesses a charge sufficient to influence the planets in their orbits or the comets in theirs. In the Newtonian celestial mechanics, based on the theory of gravitation, electricity and magne tism play no role. When physicists came upon the idea that the atom is built like a solar system, the atoms of various chemical elements differing in the mass of their suns (nuclei) and the number of their planets (electrons), the notion was looked upon with much favor. But it was stressed that \"an atom differs from the solar syst em by the fact that * See p. 74. 388  WORLDS IN COLLISION it is not gravitati on that makes the electrons go round th e nucleus, but el ectricity\" (H. N. Russell). Besides this, another difference was found: an el ectron in an atom, on absorbing the energy of a photon (light), jumps to another orbit, and again to another when it emits light and releases the energy of a photon. Because of this phenomenon, comparison with the solar system no longer seemed valid. \"We do not read in the morning ne wspapers that Mars leaped to the orbit of Saturn, or Saturn to the orbit of Mars,\" wrote a critic. True, we do not read it in the morning papers; but in ancient records we have found simila r events described in de tail, and we have tried to reconstruct the facts by comparing many ancient records. The solar system is actually built like an atom; only, in keeping with the smallness of the atom, the jumping of electrons from one orbit to another, when hit by the energy of a photon, takes place many times a second, whereas in accord with the vastness of the solar system , a similar phenomenon occurs there once in hundreds or thousands of years. In the middle of the second millennium before the present era, the terrestrial globe experienced two displacements; and in the ei ghth or seventh century before the present era, it experienced three or four mo re. In the period between, Mars and Venus, and the moon also, shifted. Contacts between celestial bodies are not limited to the domain of the solar system. From time to time a nova is seen in the sky, a blazing fixed star wh ich until then had been small or invisible. It burns for weeks or months and then loses its light . It is thought that this may be the result of a collision between two stars (a phenomenon that, acco rding to the tidal theory, occurred to the sun or to its theoretical companion). Comets arrivi ng from other solar systems may have been born in such collisions. If the activity in an atom constitutes a rule for the macrocosm, then the events described in this book were not merely accidents of celestial tr affic, but normal phenomena like birth and death. The discharges between the planets, or the great photons emitted in th ese contacts, caused metamorphoses in inorganic and organic nature. Of these things I inte nd to write in another volume, where problems WORLDS IN COLLISION  389 of geology and paleontology and the theory of evolution will be discussed. Having discovered some historical facts and havi ng solved a few problems, we are faced with more problems in almost all fields of science; we are not free to stop and rest on the road on which we started when we wondered whether Jos hua's miracle of stopping the sun was a natural robin-bobin"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"phenomenon. Barriers between sciences serve to crea te the belief in a scientist in any particular field that other scientif ic fields are free from problems, a nd he trusts himself to borrow from them without questioning.

We realize the limitations which a single scholar must be aware of on facing such an ambitious program of inquiry into the architectonics of the world and its histor y. In earlier centuries philosophers not infrequently attempted a synthe sis of knowledge in its various branches. Today, with knowledge becoming more and more specialized, whoever tries to cope with such a task should ask in all humility the question put at th e beginning of this volume: Quota pars operis tanti nobis committitur—Which part of this work is committed to us? robin-bobin"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"SELECTIVE Aaron, 133, 166, 293 Abihu, son of Aaron, 56 Achaeans, 247-249 Acosta, J. de, 339 Adam, city of, 139 Adar, month of, 351 Adrastus of Cyzicus, 158 Aegospotami, 289 Aeneas, 246 Aeschylus, 151, 282 Aethiopia, people of, 144 Africa, 76, 380, 383 Agassiz, Louis, 76 Agni, Vedic deity, 133, 134 Agog, King, 151, 158 Ahaz, King, 212-213, 216-219, 233, 237-238, 274, 322, 351, 353, 363 Ahaziah, King, 185 Ahriman, 183, 185 L'Aigle (the fall of meteorites at), 41 Ainu peoples, in Japan, 327 Ajalon, in Palestine, 39, 45 Akhet-Aten, in Egypt, 281 Alaska, 326-329, 383 Alexander of Macedonia, 53, 89, 382 Algonquin tribe, 309 Almagest, by C.
