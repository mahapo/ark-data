It was then that I realized that the Exodus had occurred in the midst of a natural upheaval and that this catastrophe might prove to be the connecting link between the Israelite and Egyptian his- tories, if ancient Egyptian texts were found to contain references to a similar event, I found such references and before long had worked out a plan of reconstruction of ancient history from the Exodus to the conquest of the East by Alexander the Great. Already by October of the same year I had come to understand the nature and extent of that catastrophe. For a decade after that I worked simultaneously on Ages in Chaos and Worlds in Collision, the present work requiring the lion's share of the toil. Ages in Chaos covers largely the period dealt with in Worlds in Collision the eight hundred years from the Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt to the invasion of Palestine by Sennacherib in 687 be- fore the present era, and the additional three and a half centuries to Alexander of Macedonia, altogether twelve hundred years of the history of the ancient East. But whereas the first work con- centrated on the description of the physical history of the period, the present work deals with its political and cultural aspects. The occurrence of a widespread natural catastrophe serves here only as the point of departure for constructing a revised chronology of the times and lands under consideration. I searched the records of one land after another and went from one generation to another, taking from everywhere hints and clues, evidence and proof. Because I had to discover and to collate them, this book is written like a detective story.

In the case of Worlds in Collision the procedure was repeatedly reversed. Sci- entific rejection demands invalidation of the evidence presented. Nothing of the kind was done with Worlds in Collision, The few arguments offered whatever could be gathered from numerous re- views-I answered point by point in a debate with Professor J. Q. Stewart, astronomer at Princeton University, published in the June 1951 issue of Harpers magazine, fourteen months after the publica- tion of the book. No argument was left unanswered, and no new one has been presented since then, though emotional outbursts have not ceased. Finally, a new strategy was employed: the views expounded in Worlds in Collision were appropriated piecemeal by those who first opposed them, though not with frankness and candor, but rather under die guise of showing how wrong the author of that heretical book is. At present no chapter of Worlds in Collision needs to be rewritten and no thesis revoked. Groat are the changes in the political hisloiy of the ancient Kast offered in Age<(t in Clutott. I claim the right to fallibility in de- tails and I eagerly welcome constructive criticism. Howver, before proclaiming that the entire structure must collapse because an argument can be made against this- or that point, the critic should carefully weigh his argument against the whole M'lit'mc, complete with all its evidence. The historian who permits his attrnfiuu to Iw monopolized by an argument directed against MJIW <l*Uil. to the extent of overlooking the work as a whole and the inunifoM jwtoi's on which it stands, will only demonstrate the narrowness of his ap- proach to history.

When, one day, the guide brought the tidings to him that an alligator had eaten her, the professor could not but smile. \"You mean,\" he said, \"a crocodile?\" I believe that the evidence collated in Ages in Chaos warrants the reconstruction offered. Sooner or later, and it may be any day, some new archaeological discovery will verify the main thesis of this book, and then it will become apparent even to the indolent, for whom only a fulfilled prophecy is an argument. The recent discovery of two-lapguage texts old Hebrew and \"Hittite\" pictographs and thus of a clue to the undeciphered picto- graphs of Asia Minor and Syria, gives promise of revealing facts of unmeasured significance. For this reason, too, I should delay no longer the present pub- lication. Is it not the case that at first a new idea is regarded as not true, and later, when accepted, as not being new? The publication of the second and final volume of Ages in Chaos is scheduled for a few months from now. There the reader of the first volume will find the eventual solution of the drama in which centuries are shifted on the scale of time.

From the day when., at the age of thirteen, he left the home of his parents and went on foot to one of the old centers of talmudic learn- ing in Russia, to the day when, in December 1937, at tJie age of seventy-eight, he ended his years in the land of Israel, he devoted his life, his fortune, his peace of mind, all that he had, to the realiza- tion of what was once an idea, the renaissance of the Jewish people in its ancient land. He contributed to the revival of the language of the Bible and the development of modern Hebrew by publishing (with Dr. /. Klausner as editor) collective works on Hebrew phi- lology, and to the revival of Jewish scientific thought by publishing, through his foundation, Scripta Universitatis, to which scientists of many countries contributed and thus laid the groundwork for Hebrew University at Jerusalem. He was first to redeem the land in Negeb, the home of tlie patriarchs., and he organized a co-operative settlement there which he catted Ruhama; today it is the largest agricultural development in northern Negeb. I do not know whom I have to thank for intellectual preparedness for this reconstruction of ancient history if not my late father, Simon."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"ACKNOWLEDGMENTS In composing this reconstruction, I incurred a debt to archaeologists, who for more than a century have toiled in excavating numerous places in the lands of the ancient East; to generations of philologists, who have read the ancient texts; and to those among the scholars who have made easier the work of research by collecting and classifying the material. I am grateful to Dr. Walter Federn, of the Asia Institute, New York, who has always been ready to help me with his incomparable knowledge o* Egyptological literature. I feel my obligation to him all the more be- cause he has never committed himself to my thesis. It took him more than six years to concede that conventional history is not built on unshakable foundations. His arguments have been a steady incentive for me to col- lect more and more proof, to collate more and more historical material, until the book attained its present form. His criticism has always been constructive. I am also indebted to Dr. Robert H. Pfeiffer, outstanding authority on the Bible. Director of the Harvard excavation at Nuzi, curator of the Semitic Museum at Harvard University, professor of ancient history at Boston University, editor of the Journal of Biblical Literature (1943-47), and author of a distinguished standard work on the Old Testament, he is eminently qualified to pass judgment. In the summer of 1942, when the manuscript was still in its first draft, he read Ages in Chaos and suggested that I try to prove my thesis on archaeological art material. I followed his advice, and the second volume of this work carries chapters on \"Ceramics and Chronology\" and \"Metallurgy and Chronology,\" in addition to a number of scattered sections dealing with the problems of ancient art, paleography, and stratigraphical archaeology. He read later drafts, too, and showed a great interest in the progress of my work. Neither subscrib- ing to my thesis nor rejecting it, he kept an open mind, believing that only objective and free discussion could clarify the issue. Neither he nor Dr. Federn nor anyone else shares any responsibility whatsoever for any statement in this book. ^ Professor J. Garstang, excavator of Jericho, read an early draft of the first chapter. It was his opinion that the Egyptian record of the plagues, as set forth in this book, and the biblical passages dealing with the plagues are so similar that they must have had a common origin."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"V ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Dr. I.

It is a sequence of chapters, each of which is like a court hearing, where witnesses are brought to the stand to disprove the validity of the old and to attest to the accuracy of a new concept of ancient history. The old story of mankind, never before disputed, is here assailed as distorted, and a reconstruction is presented. The period under investigation covers over one thousand years, ending with the advent of Alexander the Great Many wondrous things happen when historical perspective is distorted. In order to understand the scope of the displacements in the history of the ancient world, one must try to conceive of the chaos which would result if a survey of Europe and America were written in which the history of the British Isles were some six hun- dred years out of line, so that in Europe and America the year would be 1941 while in Britain it would be 1341. As Columbus discovered America in 1492, the Churchill of 1341 could not have visited this country, but must have visited some other land the scholars would be divided in their opinion as to the whereabouts of that land and met its chief. Another chief, not Franklin Delano Roosevelt of Washington, would live in history as cosigner of a charter with Churchill of Britain in 1341. But as American records would speak of Churchill who crossed the ocean in the early forties of the twentieth century, British history would also have a Churchill II, six hundred years after the first one. Cromwell would also be doubled by the same process. He would have to live three hundred years before Churchill I and also three hundred years after him, or three hundred years before Churchill II. The First World War would be fought twice, as would the Second. The First World War, in its second variant, would follow"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION the Second World War, in its first variant, by five and three quarter centuries. By the same token, the development of the Constitution, the cultural life, the progress of technology and the arts, would appear in chaotic distortion. Newton in England would become an early forerunner of Coper- nicus instead of following him. Joan of Arc would revive the old traditions of the suffragettes of the post-Victorian days; she would be burned twice with an interval of six hundred years between; or, with the growing confusion of history, she would have to return to the stake a few centuries from today to suffer her death again. In the case presented, not only the history of the British Isles would bo doubled and distorted, but also the history of the entire world. Difficulties would, of course, arise, but they would be swept away as oddities. Complicated theories would bo proposed and dis- cussed, and if accepted, they would establish themselves as new, strong obstacles to a correct perception of past history. Ancient history is distorted in this very manner. Because of the disruption of synchronism, many figures on the historical scene are \"ghosts'* or \"halves\" and \"doubles/\" Events are often duplicates; many battles are shadows; many speeches are echoes; many treaties are copies; even some empires are phantoms. The primary error can be found in Egyptian history; because of retardation, the history of Egypt was taken out of real contact with the histories* of other peoples. Events in which tho people of Kj^ypt and the people of Assyria or Babylonia or Media were involved wens recorded in the histories of these peoples from the Kjjyptiun annuls; the same events were then described for the second timo in the* history of Egypt, the annals of these other peoples, participants in tho events, being the source. Thus the histories of Assyria, Babylonia, and Media arc disrupted and spoiled; tho history of tho \"Hittite Empire\" is entirely Invented; tho Greek history of the Mycenaean period is displaced and that of the pre-Aloxander period is lacerated and Spartan and Athcmian warriors, even those with well-known names, appear oneo mow on tho pages of history as archaic intruders out of the gloom of the past The process of leveling out the histories of the peoples of the"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION ancient world to an exact synchronism will provide some exciting moments. We shall see in a new light many historical documents which had been misinterpreted when presented in an incorrect historical perspective. We shall read the story of the plagues of the days of the Exodus, written by an Egyptian eyewitness and preserved on papyrus. We shall be able to establish the identity of the mysterious Hyksos, and also to indicate the site of their stronghold Auaris, probably the greatest fortress of ancient times. We shall read the Queen of Sheba's record of her journey to Jerusalem in the days of Solomon, and shall see illustrations depicting this voyage and showing the in- habitants, animals, and plants of Palestine of that time. We shall have before our eyes photographs of the vessels and furniture and utensils of the Temple of Solomon as cut in stone bas-reliefs by a contemporaneous artist. Then will follow texts of letters written by the Jewish kings Jehoshaphat of Jerusalem and Ahab, the sinner of Jezreel, and also by their military chiefs, signed with names we know from the Scriptures. Of still greater scope are the effects of the revision for Egyptian, Assyrian, and Babylonian histories, and also for the concept of the Greek past. The rectification of chronology, without altering the sequence of the Hebrew past, enriches its records bountifully. The history of Egypt, and following it the histories of Babylonia, Assyria, Media, Phoenicia, Crete, and Greece, change their length. The ar- chitectonics of the world past, when redesigned, shows its structure properly joined in time and space. It shows that kings were made their own great-great-grandchildren. Imaginary empires were de- scribed, and museum halls have been opened to display the arts of empires which did not exist: the art objects are products of other centuries, even of another millennium. This is the case with the Hiltitc Empire and its art. This is the case with the Human people and their language. Through the laborious efforts of scholars, achievements have been recorded without knowledge of their real nature.

The history of Egypt reaches back to hoary antiquity; the Jewish people has a history that claims to describe the very beginning of this nation's march through the centuries. At the dawn of their his- tory the Israelites, an unsettled tribe, came from Canaan to Egypt There they grew to be a people; there, also, they bore the yoke of bondage. Their eventful departure from Egypt is the most treasured recollection of their past, and their traditions tell its story number- less times. The annals of Egypt, we are told, did not preserve any record of this sojourn of the Israelites or of their departure. It is not known when the Exodus occurred, if it happened at all. A few scholars have expressed the opinion that the sojourn of the Israelites, their bondage, and their departure are mythological motifs; the absence of direct reference to these events on Egyptian monuments and papyri seems to corroborate this view. However, it has been ar- gued that no people would invent legends about bondage which were not calculated to enhance the dignity of the nation, and therefore, it was insisted, there must be a historical basis for the story. Historians disagree as to the date of the Exodus, and many hy- potheses have been proposed.

The pharaohs from the Twenty-first to the Thirtieth Dynasties were small kings, who left no important records, and their age is called the \"late period/ 7 Some of these pharaohs, we are told, led armies against Palestine and Babylonia; however, the sources are usually not Egyptian, but for the most part scriptural.

Ramses III of the Twentieth Dy- nasty began to reign in 1200 or a few years later. These dates are regarded as of importance for establishing the time of the Exodus. *Tho division into kingdoms is modem, but the Egjnptians themselves had similar concepts of their past. Compare H.

David established his kingship about 1000. For only approximately one hundred years, during the reigns of Saul, David, and Solomon, was the kingdom undivided. In the days of Solomon's heir it was split in two Israel in the north and Judah in the south. About 722 the Ten Tribes of Israel, after the capture of their capital, Samaria, by Sargon II of Assyria, went into exile, from which they did not return.

There has never been any doubt on this point; where scholars nave differed is concerning the king of the New Kingdom to whose reign the Exodus is to be ascribed. Al- though, as noted above, no definite statement bearing directly on the Exodus has been found in Egyptian historical documents, cer- tain details do appear which invite discussion. What Is the Historical Time of the Exodus? The oldest theory places the Exodus at the earliest date: the Israelites were identified with the Hyksos, and the Exodus was identified with the expulsion of the Hyksos, Manetho, the priest previously mentioned, wrote that the Hyksos., when expelled from Egypt, went to Syria and there built Jerusalem, 1 - Josephus Flavius, the Jewish historian of the first century, polemized against Apion, the grammarian, and against Manetho, his source, but accepted and supported the view that the Israelites were the Hyksos. Julius Africanus, one of the Fathers of the Church, wrote on the authority of Apion that in the days of Abmose the Jews revolted under Moses. 2 Eusebius, another Father of the Churck, in his Canon wrote a gloss to the name Cencheres of one of the later kings of the Eighteenth Manetho, though making the Hyksos expelled from Egypt the builders of Jerusalem, told another story, that he assigned to a later epoch, in which he related that lepers, segiegated in Auaris on Sie eastern border of Egypt, usurped the power in Egypt with the help of the Solymites (the people of Jerusalem) and were utterly cruel, and that their chief, Osarsiph, adopted the name of Moses and led them to Palestine when they were expelled. Josephus did not separate the two Manetho stories. a julim Africanus, \"Chronography,\" in The Ante-Nicene Fathers, ed. A. Roberts and J. Donaldson (New York, 1896), VI, 134. There he confused Ahmose I, the first king of the New Kingdom, with Ahmose II ( Amasis of Herodotus), the last king before the conquest of Egypt by Cambyses, the Persian. But in his Canon condensing the list of Dynasties of Manetho, he added this remark to the list of the kings of the Eighteenth Dynasty: \"The first of those was Amos [Ahmose], in whoso reign Moses went forth from Egypt, as I have de- clared; but, according to the convincing evidence of the present calculation it follows that in this reign Moses was still young.\" Manetho (trans.

The neglect of early Christian sources seemed justifiable: did not Augustine make Moses and Prometheus contemporaries? 4 The identification of the Israelites with the Hyksos was many times accepted 5 and as often rejected. Even today a group among the historians maintains that the Exodus took place at the very begin- ning of the Eighteenth Dynasty and that the story of the Exodus is but an echo of the expulsion of the Hyksos. However, in view of the bondage of the Israelites in Egypt and the bondage of Egypt under the Hyksos, the identity of martyred slaves and cruel tyrants must be regarded as a very strained hypothesis. Therefore a variant has been proposed, according to which the Israelite nation never so- journed in Egypt; the Ilyksos sojourned there and then departed; the Israelites, hearing of the traditions of a strange people, adapted them to the stories of their own past. Apart from the incongruity of identifying the Ilyksos with the Israelites, the tyrants with the oppressed, there is a further diflinilly in the fact that during the time of the successors to Ahmose there was no likely moment for an invasion of Palestine by Israelite refu- gees from Egypt The pharaohs who followed Ahmosc wen* strong kings, and it is regarded as established that Palestine was under their domination.

A large group of scholars regard another moment as providing the clue for determining the time of the Exodus. In the 1880s, in the Nile Valley, at a place to which archaeologists gave the name of Tell el-Amarna, a correspondence on clay tablets was found which dated from the time of Amenhotep III and his son Akhnaton. Some of them were anxious letters written from Jerusalem (Uru- salim), warning the pharaoh of an invasion by the \"Habiru. [Khabiru]/' 8 approaching from Trans-Jordan. Granting that the Habiru were identical with the Hebrews, the Exodus must have taken place one or two generations earlier. 9 The scriptural statement (I Kings 6:1) that the Temple of Solomon was built four hundred and eighty years after the Exodus would point to the middle of the fifteenth century, and computations have been made which indicate 1447 as the year of the Exodus. This year would fall in the reign of Amcnhotep II; and the invasion of Palestine in 1407 would co- incide with the time of the el-Amarna letters. The view that the Habiru were invading Hebrews was corroborated by the results of excavations of Jericho, where in the walls of the ancient city were found indications of earthquake and signs of fire, which the excavator referred to 1407 or thereabouts the time of the el- Amarna correspondence. 10 This earthquake might have been the 7 Hall, in The People and the Book, ecL Peake, p. 7.

However, in the view of students of Egyptology, the time of Amenhotep II hardly seems to have been suitable for such a venture* \"Of all theories, to place the Exodus, say, in the reign of Amenhotep II, in order to agree with traditional dates, seems to the historian of Egypt the least probable\" 12 Stress has also been laid on the fact that Palestine was under Egyptian rule as late as Ac disturbances of 1358, which put an end to the reign of Akhnaton. \"Joshua did not find any such Egyp- tian hold during his conquest/* 18 The end of Akhnatcm's reign and the close of the Eighteenth Dynasty in the days of Tutankhamen and Aye was a time favorable for rebellion and the withdrawal of the slaves from Egypt.

Merneptah did not perish in the sea, nor did he suffer a debacle; he obviously inflicted a defeat on Israel and ravaged Palestine. The circumstances do not correspond with the pronounced tradition of Israel, but since it is the first men- tion of Israel, Merneptah is regarded by many as the Pharaoh of the Exodus (about 1220), and Ramses II, his predecessor, as the Pharaoh of Oppression. 15 Other scholars, however, consider the mention of Israel in Palestine in the days of Merneptah not as a cor- roboration, but as a refutation of the theory that Merneptah was the Pharaoh of the Exodus. They argue that if he found Israel already in Palestine, he could not have been the Pharaoh of the Exodus. xo A further obstacle to placing the Exodus in the reign of Merneptah has also been emphasized. If he really was the Pharaoh of the Exodus, then the Israelites must have entered Palestine at least a generation later, about 1190 to 1180; on this theory there re- mains only a century for the events of Judges. \"The attribution of the Exodus to the reign of Meneptah [Merneptah] (c. 1220 B.C.), 1B This view is found in R.

Even before the discovery of the Merneptah stele, he was identified by not a few scholars as the Pharaoh of the Exodus, because his prede- cessor, Hamses II, was thought to be the Pharaoh of Oppression. This role was ascribed to Ramses II because of the mention of the city of Ramses in the Book of Exodus.

Moreover, why do the Books of Joshua and Judges, which cover four hundred years, ignore the rule of Egypt and, indeed, fail to mention Egypt at all?

A heavy cloud darkened the sky, which was rent by incessant light- ning. A hurricane raged the whole night, and at dawn the sea was cleft, the waters torn by a double tide of gigantic force. The slaves passed through; the pursuers followed in chariots; but the waters returned, and the Egyptians with their king, fleeing against them, met their death in the waves. Attempts were made to explain this story as a natural phenome- non. It seemed difficult to give credence to its miraculous element; but the vivid description of the night, the hurricane, and the moun- tainous waves suggested that some event had actually taken place, the memory of which was later clothed in fantastic elaborations. The constant return, through the centuries, of Jewish thought to some experience by the sea also suggested that not the whole story had been invented. Historians agree that the most precious tradi- tion of the people was born on the shores of the Jam-Suf, generally translated as \"Red Sea.\" A river or sea cleft in two is a frequent motif in folklore. The pursuers probably experienced some catastrophe, not because of a sea rent in twain, but because of a tide swollen by the storm. But an explanation based on ebb and flood tides is obviously in- valid.

A more plausible explanation would therefore omit the tides and content itself with the storm. Some l of the chariots of die pursuing Egyptians sank in the sea when its billows broke over the shore. Then the Israelites sang their song of deliverance, or received the inspiration out of which the exaggerated picture of the catastrophe was later born. How could it be otherwise than exaggerated when the annals of Egypt know nothing about the sea engulfing a king and his chariots, while the descendants of the fugitives from royal bondage glorified themselves with a story of a miraculous storm un- witnessed by the Egyptians? Is there then any use in endeavoring to show that a strong cast wind, blowing from evening till dawn, could force the sea to retreat, and that a change in the direction of the wind could overwhelm an army marching on land? Strange, indeed, is the persistence with which the Jewish people have clung to this story, making it the be- ginning and at the sainc lime the most drazuulie episxxle of their history as a nation. The fugitives, after their escape, entered a desert, a desolate wasteland. The Book of Exodus relates that a pillar of smoke went before them by day and a pillar of fire by night. A simple explana- tion of this portent has been found: at the head of wandering cam- vans a torch is usually carried lifted high to show the way to the moving train. Because of the heat of tho day, caravans prefer to move at night, and tho burning and smoking pitch is intended to prevent anyone from being lost and to frighten the beasts of the desert 11 Although this explanation is the one that is accepted and found in numerous Bible dictionaries, it is too simple. The pillar of smoke and fire deeply impressed the Israelites; it was said to be the Angel of God. Did the Israelites not know the manner and custom of caravans journeying in the desert, and were they so impressed by common things and so anxious for wonders* that tho torch in the hand of the leader became for them an angel? ^Scst*, for tixumplc, S.

The verse from Exodus 13:21 reads: \"... by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light/* The lines from Pindar (Odes Pythia, I, 22-24) describe Etna: \"By day a burning stream of smoke; but by night a ruddy eddying flame.\" Beginning with this parallel and going over to the biblical description of the day of the lawgiving, Beke came to the startling conclusion expressed in the title of his pamphlet. The day of the lawgiving is described in these words: *And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled. . . . And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke . . . and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly. . . And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off.\" 13 Beke explained the pillar of smoke and fire as the ignited column of ashes and vapors erupted by the volcano. He cited instances from volcanic regions showing that volcanic eruptions can produce black clouds of ashes that darken the sky and are sometimes swept over great distances. Eruptions are usually accompanied by rumblings in the bowels of the earth; earthquakes and eruptions are often con- current phenomena; earthquakes that shake the bottom of the sea create tidal waves that may retreat from the shore and then return to enyalf the land, leaving destruction in their wake.

These narratives of geologic changes, persistently repeated in the above and many other similar passages in connection with the time of the Exodus, must have had some underlying experience that folklore molded and remolded. The experience, according to the Scriptures, was so majestic and terrible that even after a long line of succeeding generations it could not be forgotten.

The turbulence and uproar of nature stirred the fugitives in the desert to a state of exaltation: Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh. Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment. 7 The niglits under the raging sky of the wilderness torn by unceas- ing lightnings, when flaming lava flowed and hills melted, were un- forgettable. During the long years in which the Israelites lived in their land, they never forgot the convulsions of the desert, the explosion of the burning mountain, the fury of the waters. The events of these weeks or months, when the surface of the earth underwent violent changes in its tectonic structure, became the most important tradition of this nation. The scriptural tradition persists that before the Israelites left Egypt this land was visited by plagues, forerunners of a great Holocaust caused by frenzied elements.

The logical question to be asked here is: Is this testimony entirely false? And if it is not a collection of misleading inventions, can it be that nothing of this was noticed by the Egyptians? If their land did suffer from the disaster, are we not on the right track in our search for a synchronic moment in the Jewish and Egyptian histories? A desert close to Egypt was convulsed by earth tremors. Were these seismic disturbances of great magnitude confined to a comparatively small area? Is any earthquake at all mentioned in Egyptian records? The standard works on Egyptian history contain no mention of an earthquake, and none of plagues. Nevertheless, we should like to persist with our question. In this persistence we are guided by the consideration that something great may be at stake. If we could help this witness on the stand the annals of aneient Egypt to remember some vast catastrophe, we might perchance obtain a precious clue to an obscure problem, at whose door all disputes, now more than two thousand years old, have remained without decision.

If so, how is it that it became the most ex- citing memory of generations of the Jewish people? Whence came the visions of an upheaval that rent earth and sea? Is the turmoil that visited the land and its river, the sea and the desert, really not to be found in Egyptian writings? Did every recollection of it vanish? In view of the failure of works on the history of Egypt to mention any natural catastrophe, we should investigate the ancient sources. It is not known under what circumstances the papyrus containing the words of Ipuwer was found. According to its first possessor (Anastasi), it was found in \"Memphis,\" by which is probably meant the neighborhood of the pyramids of Saqqara. In 1828 the papyrus was acquired by the Museum of Leiden in the Netherlands and is listed in the catalogue as Leiden 344. The papyrus is written on both sides. The face (recto) and the back ( verso ) are differentiated by the direction of the fiber tissues; tbe story of Ipuwer is written on the face, on the back is a hymn to a deity. A facsimile copy of both texts was published by the authorities of the museum together with other Egyptian documents.* The text of Ipuwer is now folded into a book of seventeen pages, most of them containing fourteen lines of hieratic signs ( a flowing writing used by the scribes, quite different from pictorial hiero- glyphics). Of the first page only a third the left or last part of eleven lines is preserved; pages 9 to 16 are in very bad condition- there are but a few lines at the top and bottom of the pages and of the seventeenth page only the beginning of the first two lines remains. The first interpretation of the text of Ipuwer was presented in the introduction to the facsimile. 2 It was explained that eight pages of the recto were proverbs or axioms, and the following pages were supposed to be a chapter out of a philosophic work. The author of the next attempt to translate the text ( only the first 3 C, Lecmans, Aegyptteche Monvmenten van het Nederlandscke Museum van Oudheden te Leyden (Leiden, 1846), Pt 2, Face: Plates 105-13. *By F.

At the beginning of this century an effort was made to translate the entire Ipuwer text. 5 The words of Ipuwer were interpreted as prophetic in character: a time of evil was foretold for the people of Egypt, The prophet might have been inspired by some similar politi- cal situation in the past, before the inauguration of the Twelfth Dynasty. In 1909 the text, translated anew, was published by Alan II. Gardiner under the title, The Admonitions of an Egyptian Stfgc from a Hieratic Papyrus in Leiden.* Gardiner argued that all the in- ternal evidence of the text points to the historical character of the situation, Egypt was in distress; the social system had become dis- organized; violence filled the land. Invaders preyed upon tho de- fenseless population; the rich were stripped of everything and slept in the open, and the poor took their possessions. \"It is no merely local disturbance that is here described, but a great and overwhelm- ing national disaster.\" 7 Gardiner, following Lange, interprets the text as though tho words of a sage named Ipuwer were directed to some king, blaming him for inactivity which has brought confusion, insecurity* awl suffering to tho people. \"Tho Almighty /\" to whom Ipuwer directs his words, is a customary appellation of groat gotis.

Egypt in Upheaval The Papyrus Ipuwer is not a collection of proverbs (Lauth, Chabas) or riddles (Brugsch); no more is it a literary prophecy (Lange) or an admonition concerning profound social changes (Gardiner, Sethe). It is the Egyptian version of a great catastrophe. The papyrus is a script of lamentations, a description of ruin and horror. PAPYRUS 2:8 Forsooth, the land turns round as does a potter's wheel 2:11 The towns are destroyed. Upper Egypt has become dry (wastes?). 3:13 All is ruin! 7:4 The residence is overturned in a minute. 4:2 ... Years of noise. There is no end to noise. What do \"noise\" and \"years of noise\" denote? The translator wrote: \"There is clearly some play upon the word hrw (noise) here, the point of which is to us obscure.\" Does it mean \"earthquake\" and \"years of earthquake\"? In Hebrew the word raash signifies \"noise,\" \"commotion,\" as well as \"earthquake.\" 1 Earthquakes are often ac- companied by loud sounds, subterranean rumbling and roaring, and this acoustic phenomenon gives the name to the upheaval itself. Apparently the shaking returned again and again, and the coun- try was reduced to ruins, the state went into sudden decline, and life became unbearable. Ipuwer says: PAPYRUS 6:1 Oh, that the earth would cease from noise, and tumult (uproar) be no more. The noise and the tumult were produced by the earth. The royal residence could be overthrown \"in a minute\" and left in ruins only a The other Hebrew word for \"noise,\" shaon, also means \"earthquake.\" See S.

The upheaval seems to have wrought havoc on the high seas, where ships were thrown into whirlpools; in the passage where \"the towns are destroyed,\" it is also said that ships were set adrift. The papyrus of Ipuwer contains evidence of some natural cata- clysm accompanied by earthquakes and bears witness to the ap- pearance of things as they happened at that time. I shall compare some passages from the Book of Exodus and from the papyrus. As, prior to the publication of Worlds in Collision and Ages in Chaos, no parallels had been drawn between the Bible and the text of the Papyrus Ipuwer, the translator of the papyrus could not have been influenced by a desire to make his translation resemble the biblical text. 3 2:5-6 Plague is throughout, the land, Blood is everywhere.

The Jewish written tradition persists that for a number of years after the Exodus the light of the sun was dimmed by clouds. It is rather this biblical ^shadow of death'* to which the quotation of the papyrus seems to be parallel. The Egyptian parallel to the plague of impenetrable darkness will be found on a subsequent page; the \"shadow of death\" will also have additional parallels. The Last Night before the Exodus According to the Book of Exodus, the last night the Israelites were in Egypt was a night in which death struck instantly and took vic- tims from every Egyptian home. The death of so many in a single night, even at the same hour of midnight, cannot be explained by a pestilence, which would not strike in many places at the same moment and would last more than a single hour. The story of the last plague does seem like a myth; it is a stranger in the sequence of the other plagues, which can be explained as natural phenomena. The plagues have been described here as forerunners of the catas- trophe which reached its climax at the Jam-Suf (the Sea of Pas- sage); the phenomena in the desert were the subsequent spasms of the earth's crust. Testimony from Egyptian sources about an earth- quake was sought, with the purpose of establishing a synchronic moment in Egyptian and Jewish history. The evidence, when found, brought forth more analogies and showed greater resemblance to the scriptural narrative than I had expected. Apparently we have before us the testimony of an Egyptian witness of the plagues. On careful reading of the papyrus, it appeared that the slaves were still in Egypt when at least one great shock occurred, ruining houses and destroying life and fortune. It precipitated a general flight of the population from the cities, while the other plagues probably drove them from the country into the cities. The biblical testimony was reread. It became evident that it had not neglected this most conspicuous event: it was the tenth plague.

EXODUS 12:30 And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt: for there was not a house where there was not one dead. A great part o the people lost their lives in one violent shock. Houses were struck a furious blow. EXODUS 12:27 [The Angel of the Lord] passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and de- livered our houses. The word nogaf for \"smote\" is used for a violent blow, e.g., for thrusting with his horns by an ox. 2 The residence of the king and the palaces of the rich were tossed to the ground, and with them the houses of the common people and the dungeons of captives. EXODUS 12:29 And it came to pass, that at midnight the Lord smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon. PAPYRUS 4:3, also 5:6 Forsooth, the children of princes arc dashed against the walls. 6:12 Forsooth, the children of princes are cast out in the vStreets. The sight of the children of princes smashed on the pavement of the dark streets, injured and dead amid the ruins,, moved the heart of the Egyptian eyewitness. No one saw the agony in the dungeon, a pit in the ground where prisoners were locked in, when it was filled by landslides. PAPYRUS 6:3 The prison is ruined. 8 Why is this unreasonable \"firstborn\" inserted in the Hebrew text? The explanation will follow later. 1 Gardiner accompanies the translation of the word \"to overturn\" with an explanatory example: \"To overthrow a wall/' a j.

To it corresponds the papyrus (3:14): It is groaning that is throughout the land, mingled with lamentations. The statues of the gods fell and broke in pieces: 4 \"this night . . . against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment\" (Exodus 12:12). A book by Artapanus, no longer extant, which quoted some un- known ancient source and which in its turn was quoted by Eusebius, tells of \"hail and earthquake by night [of the last plague], so that those who fled from the earthquake were killed by the hail, and those who sought shelter from the hail were destroyed by the earth- quake. And at that time all the houses fell in, and most of the temples.\" 6 The earth was equally pitiless toward the dead in their graves: the sepulchers opened, and the buried were disentombed. PAPYRUS 4:4, also 6:14 Forsooth, those who were in the place of em- balmment are laid on the high ground. A legend is preserved in the Haggada: in the last night, when the land of Egypt was smitten, the coffin of Joseph was found lying upon the ground, lifted from its grave.

In Midrash Rabba on Exodus it is written: Even pregnant women about to give birth miscarried and then them- selves died; because the Destroyer stalked abroad and destroyed all he found. 8 \"Firstborn\" or \"Chosen\" The biblical story of the last plague has a distinctly supernatural quality in that all the firstborn and only the firstborn were killed on tie night of the plagues. 1 An earthquake that destroys only the firstborn is inconceivable, because events can never attain that degree o coincidence. No credit should be given to such a record. Either the story of the last plague, in its canonized form, is a fiction, or it conceals a corruption of the text. Before proclaiming the whole a strange tale interpolated later, it would be wise to in- quire whether or not the incredible part alone is corrupted. It may be that \"the firstborn\" stands for some other word. ISAIAH 43:16 Thus saith the Lord, which maketh a way in the Sea, and a path in the mighty waters; 20 ... I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen. In the Book of Exodus it is said that Moses was commanded: EXODUS 4:22-23 And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the Lord, Israel is my son, even my firstborn. . . . and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, even thy firstborn. The \"chosen\" are here called \"firstborn.\" If Israel was the firstborn, revenge was to be taken against Egypt by the death of its firstborn. But if Israel was the chosen, then revenge was to be taken against Egypt by the death of its chosen. *Midra$h Rdbbah (English trans, edited by H.

Therefore: \"at midnight the Lord smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt\" (Exodus 12:29) must be read \"all the select of Egypt/' as one would say, \"all the flower of Egypt'* or \"all the strength of Egypt.\" \"Israel is my chosen: I shall let fall all the chosen of Egypt.\" Natural death would usually choose the weak, the sick, the old. The earthquake is different; the walls fall upon the strong and the weak alike. Actually the Midrashim say that \"as many as nine tenths of the inhabitants have perished.\" 3 In Psalms 135 my idea is illustrated by the use of both roots where two words of the same root would have been expected. For the Lord hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for his pe- culiar treasure. . . . Who smote the firstborn of Egypt.

The death of the prince could have been an outward reason for changing the text. The intrinsic reason lies in the same source that interrupted the story of the Exodus at the most exciting place after the houses of the Egyptians had crumbledwith these sentences: EXODUS 13:2 Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine. 13 ... and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem. Jeremiah testifies to the fact that burnt offerings and sacrifices were not ordered on the day Israel left Egypt. PEREMIAH 7:22 For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land o Egypt, con- cerning burnt offerings or sacrifices.

Revolt and Flight My endeavor has been to find in Egyptian sources some mention of a natural catastrophe.

It is therefore only natural to look for mention of revolt among the"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"LINK BETWEEN EGYPTIAN AND ISRAELITE HISTORIES 35 population, of a flight of wretched slaves from this country visited by disaster, and of a cataclysm in which the pharaoh perished. Although in the mutilated papyrus there is no explicit reference to the Israelites or their leaders, three facts are clearly described as consequences of the upheaval: the population revolted; the wretched or the poor men fled; the king perished under unusual circumstances. If, in addition to the closely parallel description of the plagues, I should try to extract more than these three facts from the papyrus, I should expose myself to the charge that I use the defective condition of the document to support preconceived ideas. But the references to the catastrophe and to the population that rebelled and fled are not ambiguous; their meaning is clear and not open to misunderstanding. Consequently, when, in the next few paragraphs, I try to uncover additional parallels in certain passages, I do so with restraint. The papyrus is damaged and obscure in many places; if one or another comparison is incomplete or arbitrary, it may add nothing to, but neither does it detract anything from, the fact established here, that a sequence of earthquakes and other natural phenomena occurred in Egypt, accompanied by plagues bringing destruction to men, animals, plants, and sources of water. The first omens of an approaching catastrophe brought unrest to the land, and the captives longed to escape to freedom. The papyrus narrates that \"men ventured to rebel against the Uraeus\" (the em- blem of royal authority) and that magical spells connected with the serpent are divulged (6:6-7 to 7:5-6), that gold and jewels \"are fastened on the neck of female slaves'* (3:2-3; compare with Exodus 11:2: \"and let every man borrow of his neighbor, and every woman of her neighbor, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold . . /'). The collapse of stone structures, the dead and wounded in the debris, the fall of many statues of the gods, inspired dread and horror; all these were looked upon as the acts of the God of the slaves.

In the Book of Exodus it is said that the Israelites left the country \"in haste\" (Exodus 12:33) and \"could not tarry\" (12:39). No doubt flight and living in makeshift tents was shared by the majority of the survivors, as has happened many times since then whenever a violent shock has occurred, devastating cities; a new shock is feared by those who have escaped with their lives. A \"mixed multitude\" of Egyptians joined the Israelite slaves, and with them hastily made toward the desert (Exodus 12:38), Their first brief stop was at Succoth (13:20) which in Hebrew means \"huts.\" The escaped slaves hurried across the border of the country. By day a column of smoke went before them in the sky; by night it was a pillar of fire.

In order to find the time of the Exodus in Egyptian history, we had to search for some record of catastrophe in the physical world. This record is contained in the Papyrus Ipuwer. Many parts of the papyrus are missing. The beginning and the end, doubtless containing details, possibly names, are destroyed. But what is preserved is sufficient to impress us with this fact: before us is not merely the story of a catastrophe, but an Egyptian version of the plagues. It was surprising to find in the papyrus, in addition to the story of \"dwellers in marshes\" and \"poor men\" who fled the land scourged by plagues, laments about the invaders, who came from the deseit of Asia, preyed on the disorganized country, and became its violent oppressors. Amu or the Hyksos were the invaders who ruled Egypt during the centuries that separate the period of the Middle King- dom from that of the New Kingdom. In a subsequent section the divergent views on the date of origin of the papyrus of Ipuwer will be presented. Pi-ha-Khiroth In the sixties of the last century, in el-Arish, a town on the border between Egypt and Palestine, the attention of a traveler 1 was at- tracted to a shrine (naos) of black granite inscribed with hiero- glyphics over all its surfaces. It was used by the Arabs of the locality as a cattle trough. An account of this shrine and a partial transla- tion of the text were published in 1S90; 2 the shrine was still being used as a trough. Sometime during the present century the stone was brought to the Museum of Ismailia and a new attempt to trans- late the text was undertaken. 3 'V. Gu6rin, Judee (Paris, 1869), II, 241. =F.

The in- scription is of the Ptolemaic or Hellenistic age, but the events related are of a much earlier period, that of King Thorn and his successor. In this inscription the name of King Thorn is written in a royal car- touche, a fact that points to the historical background of the text The text, as will be demonstrated, deserves attentive study and a new definitive translation. Not even the sequence of the text is conclusively established. In the mutilated text there are these lines: The land was in great affliction. Evil fell on this earth. . , .

Nobody left the palace during nine days, and during these nine days of upheaval there was such a tempest that neither the men nor the gods could see the faces of their next. Similar mention of a darkness that lasted a number of days, that confined everyone to his place, that was accompanied by a great upheaval, and that was so complete that no one could discern the face of his neighbor, is found in the Book of Exodus in the story of the ninth plague.

Immediately thereafter came the ninth plague the thick dark- ness. In the story of the darkness in Egypt, as told in old Midrash books, additional details are given. The plague of darkness endured seven days. During the first three days one could still change his position; during the next three days one could not stir from his place. The rabbinical sources so describing the calamity of darkness are numerous. 6 Josephus Flavius 6 and Philo the Alexandrian 7 of the first century of the present era also belong to what may be called rabbinical sources. The collation of this material presents the fol- lowing picture: . . . exceeding strong west wind . . . endured seven days. All the time the land was enveloped in darkness. . . . The darkness was of such a nature that it could not be dispelled by artificial means. The light of the fire . . . was either extinguished by the violence of the storm, or else it was made invisible and swallowed up in the density of the darkness. . . .

On the basis of certain indications in the text, Pi-ha- Khiroth, where the events took place, was on the way from Memphis to Pisoped. 19 The Ermitage Papyrus A papyrus text preserved in the Ermitage in Leningrad and listed in the catalogue of that museum as \"number 1116b recto,\" 1 is a literary echo of fateful days when the empire of Egypt perished and the land fell prey to invading nomads. In this papyrus the same story is related that we now know from the Papyrus Ipuwer, but 1T The treasury city of Pithom was discovered by E. Naville in 1885 at Tell el Maskhuta, and identified with the help of an inscription. The name of the other city, Ramses, was largely tie reason why Ramses II of the Nineteenth Dynasty was identified as the Pharaoh of Oppression. It is well to remember that \"second\" is our modern reckoning of kings, and Ramses of the Nineteenth Dynasty may have had some predecessors of the same name in pre-Hyksos dynasties. Ilamses could also be a city named for a divinity. It is also possible that the name of the city Ramses (Exodus 12:37) is a later name or the P^ce; similarly we call by the name Tell el-Amama the historical Akhet-Aton.

After giving this picture of natural disaster combined with the political subjugation of Egypt by the Amu, the seer Neferrohu prophesied the liberation by a king who would be born of a Nubian, woman and called Ameny \"the Amu shall fall by his sword/* There- after \"there shall be built the Wall of the Prince* so as not to allow the Amu to go down into Egypt.\" It is questionable whether Ameny is a historical personality. Be- cause of some surmise as to his identity, the papyrus was supposed to have been written during the Old Kingdom or shortly after its end; it is also apparent that this text has much in common with the text of the papyrus in Leiden. However, the Hyksos (Amu) period in Egypt followed the end of the Middle Kingdom, The name Ameny may refer to Amenhotep I, one of the first kings of Egypt after it was freed from the Hyksos; at the time of liberation he was a prince. He is usually pictured as black, 4 which would also conform with the words **born of a Nubian woman.\" He was highly revered in later times. A literary remnant that closely resembles the Ermitage papyrus 1116b recto is a prophecy of a potter under King Amenophis [Amen- hotep]. \"The waterless Nile will be filled, the displaced winter will come in its own season. The sun will resume its course and the winds will be restrained. For in the Typhon time the sun is veiled.** This prophecy is preserved in a papyrus written in Greek, being a translation of an older Egyptian text. 5 The pharaoh's name points to one of the Amenhoteps of the New Kingdom 6 and, I assume, refers to the same Ameny or Amenhotep I. *A thick veil of clouds over the desert is mentioned repeatedly in the Scrip- tures and in the Talmud and Midrashim. 4 However, his being pictured as black may refer to his being worshiped as a deceased saint. \"Literature on this prophecy is found in G.

The first is: What were the nature and dimensions of this catas- trophe, or this series of catastrophes, accompanied by plagues, ahout which we have now very similar scriptural and Egyptian testimony? In the next chapter we shall also have the corroborating autochthonous tradition of the Arabian peninsula. A reply to this question involves a study, not only of history, but also of many other fields. A work comprising an investigation into the nature of great catastrophes of the past preceded this volume. Leaving aside here the problem of the extent and character of the catastrophe, we turn to the other question: When did the up- heaval occur? In Jewish history the answer is at hand: in the days of the Exodus. As for Egyptian history, we must first find out when the text of the Papyrus Ipuwer originated. Scholars who have studied this papyrus agree that the document is a copy of a still older papyrus: \"The scribe used a manuscript a few centuries older.\" 1 The copy was made sometime during the Nineteenth Dynasty, but 'The spelling is, on the whole, that of a literary text of the Middle Kingdom, if this term be interpreted in a very liberal way.\" 2 The question, When did the text originate? grows in importance in view of the parallels with the Book of Exodus presented here. It was understood that the question of the age of the text \"is inextricably bound up with the problem as to the historical situation that the author [Ipuwer] had in his mind.\" 8 \"The text tells both of civil war and of an Asiatic occupation of the Delta/* \"There are two periods which might possibly answer the requirement of the case: the one is the dark age that separates the sixth from the eleventh dynasty [or the Old Kingdom from the Middle Kingdom]; the other 'Gardiner, Admonitions, p. 3. \"Ibid, p. 2.

There is no definite knowledge of any in- vasion by Asiatics (Amu) during the first period that between the Old Kingdom and the Middle Kingdomand to conform with the historical background of the papyrus, such an invasion at that time must be first postulated with the help of the papyrus. 4 \"There is no such difficulty in the view preferred by Sethe/' who maintained that the time described is that of the invasion of the Hyksos, Gardiner conceded and added: \"The view that our Leiden papyrus con- tains allusion to the Hyksos has the better support from the histori- cal standpoint\" But a philological consideration \"makes us wish to put back the date of the composition as far as possible.\" The lan- guage was found beyond doubt to be not of the New Kingdom but of an earlier time. The text also contains some references to the establishment of \"Great Houses'* (law courts), which became obso- lete \"in or soon after the Middle Kingdom.\" We should remember that these Great Houses are described in the papyrus as fallen down and trodden upon by the throngs who dug in the ruins. This mention, it seems to me, points even more precisely to the time when the Middle Kingdom collapsed, and the papyrus should not, on the basis of it, be interpreted as a literary document composed in pre-Hyksos times. From the standpoint of style and language, Gardiner admitted, \"it is of course possible that our text may have been composed while the Hyksos were still in the land.\" The discussion of whether the text describes the period between the Old and Middle Kingdoms, or between the Middle and New Kingdoms, was closed by the supporter of the first view with this remark: \"It is doubtless wisest to leave the question open for the present.\" I take up the question. The historical background is that of the invasion of the Hyksos (Sethe). Philological considerations show that the text has all the signs of a literary product of the Middle *In this case \"Amu\" would designate not only the Hyksos people, but Asiatics generally."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"50 AGES IN CHAOS Kingdom (Gardiner). 5 When the historical and philological proofs are combined, all point to the end of the Middle Kingdom and the very beginning of the invasion of the Hyksos. The style would still be, of course, that of the Middle Kingdom, because in the few months since the end of this great age no change in the language and form of poetic works could have occurred. In the centuries of domination by the Hyksos literary activity ceased in Egypt. Besides, it is obvious that Ipuwer bewails the tragedy of his own time and not of a past age. In the dispute between Gardiner and Sethe, Gardiner is right in his philological arguments that the latest period from which the text could have originated is the time of the Hyksos. However, he is mistaken in assuming that the text describes events of the dark period between the Old and Middle Kingdoms, and Scthe is right in the historical argument that the events described are those of the invasion of the Hyksos after the fall of the Middle Kingdom. On the other hand, Sethe is mistaken when he ascribes the composition of the text to the New Kingdom. It was composed immediately after the fall of the Middle Kingdom, at the very beginning of the Hyksos period. The historical arguments as well as the philological argu- ments are in harmony with this solution. Those who have tried to place the Exodus in the sequence of Egyptian history have not dared to set it as far back as between the Middle and New Kingdoms (time of the Hyksos), and of course not as far back as between the Old and the Middle Kingdoms. Not only is the invasion of the Amu ( Hyksos ) the historical hack- ground of the Admonitions; so are the physical catastrophe and the plagues, and these are analogous to those of the time of the Exodus. On this basis, too, there can be no doubt that the earlier elate be- tween the Old and Middle Kingdoms is out of the question; and even the later one is embarrassing enough, for it appears to be too early for the Exodus. Is there any physical evidence known which would indicate that c Both Selhe and Gardiner regarded the text as not contemporaneous with the events described, but in discussing the age of the text, Scthe saw in it a descTip- tion of the events o the Hyksos period and considered the beginning of the Nc k w Kingdom as the time of the composition; Gardiner thought the Kingdom, or perhaps the Hyksos period > was the time of the composition*"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"LINK BETWEEN EGYPTIAN AND ISRAELITE HISTORIES 51 some major change occurred in the geologic structure of Egypt at some point of time following the Middle Kingdom? Lepsius has observed the remarkable fact that the Nilometers at Semneh dating from the Middle Kingdom show an average rise in the waters of the Nile at that place, where the river is channeled in rock, twenty-two feet higher than the highest level of today. 6 Theoretically the dropping of the water level by twenty-two feet must be ascribed either to a change in the quantity of water in the Nile since the Middle Kingdom or to a change in the rock structure of Egypt. 7 If the Nile had contained so much more water before the catastrophe, many residences and temples would have been regu- larly covered with water. Apparently the Nilometers at Semneh indicate that some violent changes in the rock formation of Egypt took place at the end of the Middle Kingdom or later. The Middle Minoan II Age, which is the period of the Cretan culture, coeval with the Middle Kingdom in Egypt, also came to a close in a terrible natural catastrophe, as the excavations at Knossos reveal. 8 There exists an important Egyptian inscription of the Queen Hatshepsut, who came to power two or three generations after ^the expulsion of the Hyksos, in which it is written: The abode of the Mistress of Qes was fallen in ruin, the earth has swallowed her beautiful sanctuary and children played over her 'Lepsius, Letters from Egypt, Ethiopia and the Peninsula of Sinai, pp. 19-20: \"Semneh.

I have arrived at a very different result. The Israelites left Egypt amid the outbreak of a great natural catastrophe. The Amu, who invaded Egypt and became the masters of the land immediately afterward, were obviously not the Israelites. The tradition of the Israelites definitely connects their departure from Egypt with the days when earth, sky, and sea excelled in wrath and destruction, but knows nothing of their arrival in Egypt in the days of a cata- clysm. \"The dwellers of the marshes\" or \"the poor men' 7 left the country under these very circumstances; they must have been the Israelites and the multitude of the Egyptians who accompanied them in the Exodus. 12 The Amu-Hyksos reached the land of Egypt, upon which they came to prey, a short time after the catastrophe.

This was but one of the battles with the Amalekites. Soon the Israelites, escaping from Egypt, came upon them in every direction they chose to go. The tribes of the desert, migrating in large bands toward Syria and Egypt, continually involved the wanderers in minor skirmishes, night raids, and irregular engagements. Suffering from lack of water in a desert covered with dust and ashes, the Israelites were plagued by the merciless despoilers, who pillaged and plundered like pirates. The upheaval at the sea, says the Haggada, had created alarm among the heathen, and none would oppose the Israelites. But this fear vanished when the Amalekites attacked them. 2 The southern approach to Canaan was closed to the Israelites, \"The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south*' (Numbers 13:29), The people in the wilderness heard this message from the twelve men when they returned from their mission to investigate Canaan, \"To intensify to the utmost,\" says the Midrash, 3 \"their fear of the inhabitants of Palestine, the scouts said: The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south/ The statement concerning Amalek was founded on fact, for although southern Palestine had not originally been their home, still they had recently settled there.* 7 The people to whom this message was brought by the twelve men \"wept that night\" (Numbers 14:1): \"Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this wilder- ness!\" (14:2.)

Then came the condemnation: \"Surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers,\" and they were doomed to wander forty years in the wilderness. And it was said to them: NUMBERS 14:25 Now the Amaleldtes and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley. Tomorrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.

The Amalekites evi- dently had conquered the south of Palestine only a short time before, because the arrivals from Egypt were not aware of their presence in that region. In the course of their migration the Ama- lekites apparently divided and turned simultaneously toward Egypt and toward the south of Palestine* Because of the Amalekites the Israelites were compelled to roam the desert for a whole generation. At this point, before introducing the entire body of evidence from Hebrew and Egyptian sources to establish the cardinal point of the identity of the Hyksos and the Amalekites, I shall ask a ques- tion, If the Hyksos really came from Arabia, might not some evi- dence of this fact be found in Arabian sources also? The old Arabian writings, when investigated, provided the de- sired evidence. I shall therefore proceed to compare the three sources: the Egyptian, the Hebrew, and the Arabian. The Amalekites were an old Arabian tribe who, from ancient days, dominated Arabia. In the Book of Genesis, in a genealogical table, Amalek is said to have been an offspring of Eliphaz, son of Esau, Isaac's son. 4 But obviously this statement does not refer to the Amalek who was father of the tribe. The Book of Genesis also has another record: as early as before the destruction of Sodom the Amalekites were at war with the kings of the Two-Stream Land, a mighty coalition. The Amalekites who participated in these battles in the days of Abraham could not have been descendants of Ama- lek, descendant of Esau, himself a descendant of Abraham. The Amalekites were thus of an older clan and no kinsmen of the Twelve Tribes. The Islamic historians consider Amalek as one of the most ancient of the Arab tribes. Abulfeda, an Arab scholar of the thirteenth cen- tury, wrote: \"Shem [son of Noah] had several sons, among them Laud, to whom were born Pharis, Djordjan, Tasm, and Amalek,\" 8 thus ascribing to these tribes a primeval existence.

Manetho is a late source on the dominance and expulsion of the Hyksos; about one thousand years separated the historian from his subject. He provides the information that after the Hyksos invaded the country, destroying, burning, raping, and ravaging, they estab- lished a dynasty of Hyksos pharaohs; that the first of these kings, named Salitis or Salatis, resided in Memphis and \"exacted tribute from Upper and Lower Egypt, and left garrisons in the places most suited for defence.

He rebuilt and strongly fortified it with walls, and established a garrison there numbering as many as two hundred and forty thou- sand armed men to protect his frontier.

The garrison-fortresses were places of tor- ture. The dominion of the Amu-Hyksos was not confined to Egypt. Scarabs, or official seals, have been found in various countries, with the names of King Apop and King Khian. The name of Khian is engraved on a sphinx discovered in Baghdad and on a jar lid found at Knossos in Crete. An inscription of Apop says that \"his father Seth, lord of Auaris, had set all foreign countries under his feet.\" In Auaris was the sacrarium of Seth, whom the Hyksos worshiped, and who, until the time of the Ramessides, was regarded by the Egyptians as the personification of the dark power (the con tester of Isis and Horus> or equivalent of the Greek Typhon).

When they sighted the Amalekites in the whirling and trembling desert they might have been unaware of the new ordeal that these despoilers would bring to Egypt. But while in Canaan, during the whole time of the Judges, the Israelites, who suffered from the onslaughts of the Amalekites, must have known that Egypt, too, was afflicted with the same plague and to an even greater degree. Is there any reference preserved in the old Jewish sources that would hint at the Hyksos invasion of Egypt immediately after the departure of the Israelites?

But in modern books on Egyptian history this period is drastically reduced. The reduction was not based on any consideration of cultural changes or archaeological finds, ancient charts or dates, but mainly on the fact that the end of the Twelfth Dynasty of the Middle King- dom is ascribed, on the ground of the astronomical computations of the Sothis period, to 1780.

If the dates are right, about two hundred years are left for the Thirteenth Dy- nasty and the Hyksos period, and since some of the kings of the Thirteenth Dynasty had long reigns, the most that can be left for the Hyksos domination in Egypt is one hundred years. This view was offered and defended by Eduard Meyer. In the view of Flinders Petrie and a few of his followers, this span of time is entirely insufficient for the interval between the Middle and the New Kingdoms. The cultural changes were enormous: as if a curtain fell at the end of the Middle Kingdom and was raised again over the entirely different scene of the New Kingdom. Because of the immense changes, Petrie advanced the idea that between the end of the Twelfth Dynasty and the beginning of the Eighteenth were not 200 years but 1660: in other words, an additional Sothis period of 1460 years was interposed by Petrie; the time of the Hyksos domination, instead of being reduced from Josephus' figure, was lengthened."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"76 AGES IN CHAOS These two schemes are called the \"long\" and the \"short chron- ology/* They have in common the date 1580 for the beginning of the New Kingdom.

Some scholars tried to take the middle road, and, disregarding the involved computations on which the Sothis reckoning is made, sug- gested a period of four or five hundred years for the Hyksos period. \"Were the Sothic date unknown, our evidence would not require more than 400 or at most 500 years between the two the twelfth and the eighteenth dynasties.\" 1 The conciliatory view did not take root among the scholars; the long chronology after the death of Petrie had very few supporters; and the short chronology, also called the chronology of the \"Berlin School,\" became supreme. In this book we occupy ourselves with Egyptian history from the moment when the Middle Kingdom came to its end with the Hyksos conquest of Egypt. If the Hyksos period is measured by the time the Amalekites dominated the Near East, or by the sum of years al- lotted by the Scriptures to the wandering in the desert and to the leadership of the Judges, a time span of over four hundred and forty years should be assigned to the period in question.

The last plague, the domina- tion of the shepherds, which had endured since the Exodus, was ap- proaching its end. The Carnarvon tablet records the participation of the vassal pharaoh Kamose, son of Seknenre, in action against the Hyksos. 2 He was assisted by some foreign troops. An Egyptian monument has also preserved a description of the final act: the story of the ex- pulsion of the Hyksos is engraved on the wall of the tomb of an officer of Ahmose, a vassal pharaoh of one of the nomes and prob- ably a brother of Kamose; the name of the officer was also Ahmose. The story is in the form of a narrative about the sieges and battles in which the officer took part. In the Ahmose inscription, which is the best available Egyptian source on the war of deliverance, an enigma is inserted concerning the most important circumstance. Obviously, not rebellious Egyp- tian princes but some warriors coming from abroad were the real deliverers of Egypt.

The Amalekites are sup- posed to have been a small tribe of unsettled Bedouins; therefore, what does the \"city of Amalek\" mean? 7 It is said that since days of old the Amalekites dwelt in the south. One indication as to the location of the place is its topography: the city was besieged from the bed of a stream (nakhal). The city must have been situated near a river. In southern Palestine, the Sinai desert, northern Arabia, and up to the boundaries of Egypt there are no rivers save the \"river of Egypt\" the wadi of el-Arish, the only river to which the Scriptures persistently apply the name nakhal. In winter it is torrential, in summer its bed is dry. A geographical indication may also be tentatively drawn from the reference in the verse that follows: *. . . until thou comest to Shur, that is over against Egypt.\" This was the southernmost point of the victorious campaign of Saul, as a result of the capture of the city of the Amalekites. I SAMUEL 15:7-8 And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to Shur, that is over against Egypt. And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive. . . . The identity of the foreign liberator of Egypt is thus revealed by the Scriptures. The \"one\" was King Saul. Apop II was Agog II. The Amalekite city was Auaris. In Egyptian and Hebrew sources alike the strategic use of the bed of the stream in the siege of this city is stressed. Rich spoils of the shepherds* city are mentioned in both sources; it consisted of oxen, sheep, and lambs (I Samuel 15:9). In both sources it is said that during this compaign the \"one\" (in the inscription of the officer Ahrnose) or Saul (in the Book of Samuel) fought the Amu-Amalekites and destroyed them \"to the south of Auaris\" or \"until thou comest to Shur, that is over against Egypt/* Contraposing the Hebrew and Egyptian sources will help to identify the location of Auaris, The material for exact identification is brought together later in this book.

It has been supposed that the text is corrupt and that instead of Havila another name must be read, or that another Havila besides the one in the land of the Euphrates was somewhere near Egypt 10 If the true role of the Amalekites during the long period of Judges is recognized, no difficulty will be encountered in accepting the text as correct.

The Hyksos Retreat to Idumaea A detail of the siege of Auaris is preserved in another document written at a much later date. Manetho narrates in his history of Egypt, as quoted by Josephus, that the Hyksos, after having been beleaguered for a long time in Auaris, were allowed under an agree- ment to leave the place. They [the besieged in Auaris] were all to evacuate Egypt and go whither they would unmolested.

The biblical record may reconcile the conflicting statements of the contemporary warrior and of the later historian as far as they concern the immediate fate of the besieged people. Before storming the Amalekite city Saul made an agreement with the tribe of the Kenites, aflSliated with the Amalekites, regarding their departure from the city under siege. i SAMUEL 15:6 And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them ... So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites. According to Ahmose, after the capture of Auaris the Hyksos-Amu who saved themselves from death escaped to Sharuhen in southern Palestine. In Manetho's story it is stated that the Hyksos, retreating from Auaris, escaped into Judea to a place which they built and named Jerusalem. There is not the shadow of a doubt that the con- temporaneous inscription on the grave of Ahmose contains the cor- rect rendition of the name of the place to which the Hyksos retired, and that the later rendering of Manetho is wrong. Either Manetho's source or his text was corrupted, and the lesser-known Sharuhen was replaced by the better known Jerusalem (Jerushalaim). This mistake, accidental or deliberate, has played a harsh role in the fate of the Jewish people beginning with the Ptolemaic age; it has left deep marks on the behavior and spiritual evolution of other peoples; only seldom has a mistake of a writing hand had so many tragic consequences as this corrupt text, which is exposed here by comparing the two Egyptian sources on the escape of the Hyksos to Sharuhen in one source, to Jerusalem in the other.

After the capture of Auaris, the stronghold and residence of Apop, the Hyksos-Amu retreated to Sharuhen 2 in southern Pales- tine, and here the last siege took place. Ahmose's version of the retreat of the Amu into southern Palestine corresponds with the scriptural narrative. After the capture of the Amalekite city and Saul's overwhelming victory, the Amalekites were not wholly de- stroyed. Those who escaped with their lives fell back to the hill country of southern Palestine. From there they undertook a raid on the neighboring cities. This was still during the reign of Saul, and David was one of his officers. I SAMUEL 30:1-3 . . . the Amalekites had invaded the south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire; . . . and went on their way, So David and his men came to the city, and behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives. The practice of burning the cities, carrying off the women and children, and withdrawing was the same as the Hyksos had em- ployed in Egypt when they invaded it, four or five hundred years before: \"They savagely burned the cities . . . carrying off the wives and children into slavery\" (Manetho, quoted by Josephus 3 ). David with four hundred men pursued the Amalekite band that had carried off his wives. In the desert they found an unconscious man who \"had eaten no bread nor drank any water three days and three nights.** i SAMXTEL 30:11-13 And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David . . . and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him. , . .

It shows that the Amalekites in- vaded the south of Palestine after they had lost their stronghold on the border of Egypt. It reveals also a very striking detail: the Egyp- tian young man said that he was a slave to an Amalekite master. Let us return the two histories that of the Hebrews and that of the Egyptians to their conventional places in chronology. What does it mean that an Egyptian, a son of the ruling and proud nation, is a servant of an Amalekite, a poor nomad? This man, in identifying himself, spoke of his being a \"servant\" and the Amalekite being the \"master\" as of something that was the order of the day, But they were already the last in their respective roles, the Egyp- tian slave and his Amalekite master. The Amalekites were in retreat and flight; the few raids, such as that from Sharuhen to Ziklag, both towns in southern Palestine, were the last offensives. Their warriors were dispersed; some of them came into the Philistine region on the coast. Ziklag was on the outskirts of the land of the Philistines, and Sharuhen was a point between Philistia and Seir, the Amalekites' old homeland. Shortly after the great natural catastrophe the Philistines arrived from the island of Caphtor and occupied the coast of Canaan. 4 They intermarried with the Amalekites, sought their favor, accepted their political leadership, provided them with metalwork and pottery, and, during the centuries that followed, lost more and more of their own spiritual heritage and became a hybrid nation. This merging of the Philistines and the Amalekites provided, I think, the basis for the Egyptian tradition (Manetho) that the Hyksos Dynasties in the later period of their rule in Egypt were of \"Phoenician origin,\" 5 and also for the assertion that the Philistines were of Amalekite blood. 6 Saul, after his great victory over the Amalekites, engaged himself in a war with the Philistines. He went into this war with a heavy heart. Samuel, the prophet, had spoken stern words to him: his kingdom would be taken from him for the kindness he had shown 'Jeremiah 47:4; Amos 9:7.

Samuel killed Agog, never met Saul again, and died. Saul, with the help of necromancy, tried to get in touch with the deceased Samuel. The day after his visit to the witch at Endor, Philistine archers struck him down in the middle of the battle. He and his three sons fell on the field. It was an Amalekite, out of the host of the Philistines, who, according to one scriptural version, killed the wounded Saul at his request and brought the evil tidings to David (II Samuel 1:8). Historical credit for freeing the Near East from the yoke of the Hyksos belongs to Saul, but his great deed was not esteemed, not even recognized. The capture of Auaris and the destruction of the Amalekite host changed the course of history. Once more Egypt rose to power and splendor after being freed from hundreds of years of abject slavery by a descendant of the Hebrews who had been slaves there. Posterity did not learn of the deeds of Saul; even his contempo- raries did not reward him with gratitude. Cursed by Samuel for his soft heart when he spared the life of Agog, driven to depression, and having a premonition of his fate, he went to his last battle. His head and the head of his son Jonathan were cut off by the Philistines and carried through the villages; the headless bodies were hung on the walls of Beth-Shan, in the valley of the Jordan. This was the sad end of the man anointed to be the first king of Judah and Israel. In a little-known page of some Haggada he is said to have been more pious than David, gentle and generous, the real \"elect of God.\" Only after overpowering the Philistines could the Israelites con- sider themselves a free people. The double task fell to David: to destroy the Amalekites in their last strongholds in southern Pales- tine, and to drive the Philistines from the hilly land. The officer Ahmose, after the fall of Auaris, followed his prince to Sharuhen in southern Palestine to participate in the siege of this stronghold. The Amu-Hyksos defended it for three long years. This last stronghold of the Amu had to be taken by storm.

A legend about the adventures of Joab, a captain of David, who penetrated alone into this \"very large'* city, became a favorite motif for storytellers. The Israelites stormed the Amalekite city, destroyed the heathen temples, and killed the inhabitants. King David was not present at this prolonged siege; King Ahmose was probably with Joab*s army as an ally. The officer Ahmose wrote: \"One besieged Sharuhen for three years and his majesty took it.\" The Egyptian king got his por- tion of the spoils and the officer Ahmose his share, and he described it. The Egyptian king returned to Egypt and undertook a campaign against Ethiopia; Joab turned his army to the east and after a time was able to put the crown of the Ammonite king at the feet of David. 9 The Queen Tahpenes On the ruins of the great Amalekite Empire two kingdoms rose simultaneously to freedom and power: Judah and Egypt. The in- heritance was divided between them. 7 The natural retreat for an army pressed at once from Egypt and from the shore of Palestine would be in the direction of Edom, more particularly toward Petra. In the days of Strabo, trade caravans coming from Arabia \"come to Petra, and then to Rhinocolura [el-Arish], which is in Phoenicia near Egypt, and thence to the other peoples,\" and according to this author, this route was pre- ferred in earlier times (Strabo, The Geography, 16, 4, 24). Sharuhen was prob- ably situated close to Petra. Petra is \"fortified all round by a rock\" (Ibid., 16, 4, 21). The early -builders of Petra are not known. See Sir H. B. W.

Having discovered in the Sethroite nome a city very favourably situated on the east of the Bubastis arm of the river, called after some ancient theological tradition Auaris, he rebuilt and strongly fortified it with walls, and established a garrison there numbering as many as two hundred and forty thousand armed men to protect his frontier. 1 According to Manetho, Auaris had a great stone wall \"in order to secure all their possession and spoil/* Several scholars have made various conjectures: it was located at Pelusium, at Tanis, and at Tell-el-Yehudiyeh.

It was a small stronghold and not the huge fortress of the Hyksos rulers, pharaohs from the Fourteenth up to the Seventeenth Dynasty.

It was situated on a river this is told in the Egyptian record of Ahmose and in the story of the siege by Saul. \"One fought on the water in the river\" (Ahmose). \"And Saul came to [the] city of Amalek, and laid wait in the stream\" (I Samuel 15:5).

The station of Thani was the northeastern outpost of Egypt, as may be seen from the description of various campaigns into Syria undertaken by kings of the Nine- teenth Dynasty. It must have been near Auaris, if it was not another name for the same place. 7 The noseless offenders were sent to a place for the \"unclean\"; one deprived of his nose was in appearance similar to a leper, unclean 4 K.

The Confusion of Hyksos and Israelites and the Beginning of Anti-Semitism The Israelites could never forget the time of their suffering in Egypt, but they did not bear any hatred against the Egyptians 1 or other peoples of antiquity; the Amalekites alone became the symbol of evil and the object of their hate.

They mutilated the wounded and blasphemed by throwing the mutilated parts of the bodies toward the heavens and jeered at the Lord. 8 A legend presents the feeling of the Israelite nation in these symbolic words: So long as the seed of Amalek exists, the face of God is, as it were, covered, and will only then come to view when the seed of Amalek shall have been exterminated.* There was also a tradition that \"God bade Moses impress upon the Jews to repulse no heathen should he desire conversion, but never accept an Amalekite as a proselyte/' For his sins Amalek shall \"the first descend to hell.\" \"God Himself took up the war against Amalek.\" The Hyksos engendered the same hatred in the Egyptians; heir extreme cruelty and their wantonness were cut deep into the memory of the people.

Ahmose wrote that when Auaris was taken, the Hyksos retreated to Sharuhen, in southern Palestine. But Manetho, many centuries later, wrote that the Hyksos retreated into Palestine and built Jeru- salem; also that at a later date, when a leper colony in Auaris re- volted, these rebels summoned the Solymites (the people of Jeru- salem) and together conquered Egypt; that these Solymites were extremely cruel to the population, and that one of the lepers, Osar- siph, had changed his name to Moses. This confused story reflects the Assyrian conquest of Egypt, when Sennacherib and Esarhaddon invaded Palestine and Egypt \"with a great host of Assyrians and Arabs.\" The people of Jerusalem never conquered Egypt. The first wave of anti-Semitism in the east was spread much later in the Persian Empire by the vizier, Haman, \"the Agagite, the Jews' enemy.\" 6 Haman, who was of the seed of Agog, the Amalekite, 6 con- spired to destroy the Jewish population in Persia and Media. We may imagine that the traditions of Hainan's house were likely to inspire this hatred. These traditions told how Hainan's royal fore- father Agog had been dispossessed by a Jewish king and killed by a Jewish prophet. In the Greek world no signs of racial antipathy toward Jews can be traced until the stories of Manetho began to circulate. The Jews were occasionally looked upon as a mysterious people, but no ex- pression of animosity or contempt is preserved in the writings of the old authors. The earliest references are by Theophrastus, Clearchus of Soli, and Megasthenes, 7 philosophers who flourished at the end of the fourth and the beginning of the third century before this era.

Clearchus told the story of a Jew from whom Aristotle learned some of his wisdom during his journey in Asia. Clearchus quoted the words of Aristotle on \"the great and admirable soberness of this Jew, and his self-restraint.\" Also, of Pythagoras and Plato it is recorded that they were in close contact with wise Jews and were anxious to learn from them. 8 Megasthenes, 9 who lived in India between 302 and 291 before the present era, wrote in his book Indica: All the opinions expressed by the ancients about nature are found with the philosophers foreign to Greece, with the Brahmans of India, and in Syria with those who are called Jews. These references to Jews in the Greek language are the only ones in the extant Greek literature from before the time Manetho's history appeared. The hatred, never extinguished in the memory of posterity, for the inhuman shepherd-conquerors was revived: the Jews were identified with the descendants of the Hyksos. Inaugurated by Manetho, an extensive Jew-baiting literature followed, and the stories of Manetho were told and retold and adorned by many writers. 10 'Among them was Apion, against whom the apology (Against Apion) of Josephus Flavius was directed. Josephus did not try to cast doubt on the identification of the Jews with the Hyksos; on the contrary, he approved it and even defended it in a most categorical manner; his only reason for doing so was his wish to establish the antiquity of the Jewish people with the help of Manetho's stories. ^'Plato derived Ms idea of God from the Pentateuch.

Hatred of the Hyksos, burning in the generations of the ancient Orient, found a target in the Jews. An equally glowing hatred of the Amalekites persisted in the memory of the Jews. A Jewish mother even today frightens her child with an \"Amalekite.\" Hatred can last a long time even when its object is not alive. How much stronger is that hatred if the hated ones did not dissolve their national existence a thousand years before on the Arabian peninsula, but are still supposed to exist? The Egyptian author saw in the Jew the wretched seed of cruel tyrants. Subsequently Greek and Roman authors established in their writings the object for the never dying necessity to hate. Insinuations were heaped one on the other, and monstrous stories were invented about the head of an ass which the Jews kept in their temple and worshiped, and about the human blood they sucked. The curse on the Amalekites became a curse on the Israelites. \"Thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under the heaven.\" It was blotted out. No one knew any longer that the Amalekites were the Hyksos. The Israelites endured much suffering from this distortion of history. They bore their pain for being identified with the Hyksos.

Thus, establishing the period in which the Exodus took place becomes of paramount importance: Israel did not leave Egypt dur- ing the New Kingdom, as all scholars maintain, but at the close of the Middle Kingdom. The entire period of the Hyksos lies in be- tween; the expulsion of the Hyksos was neither identical with the Exodus nor did it take place before the Exodus. The Hyksos were expelled by Saul; their later destruction was the work of Joab, soldier of David. David lived in the tenth century, and Saul was his predecessor on the throne. The expulsion of the Hyksos is put at 1580, which leaves almost six centuries unaccounted for. Whose history is to be moved by these centuries? Is it possible to place David in the sixteenth century before this era? No student of ancient history will see the slightest possibility of altering the his- tory of the kings of Jerusalem by a single century, much less by six, without disrupting all established data and concepts.

The kings of Arabia paid him tribute, and presents were brought from near and far, vessels of silver and of gold, garments and spices, armor and horses. He made cedars in Jerusalem \"to be as sycamore trees in the vale of abundance.\" He built a palace with a great throne of ivory, and a house of worship. Vessels therein were of gold; of gold were the drinking cups of his palace. Six hundred threescore and six talents of gold came yearly to his treasury as tribute, besides the income from tibe traffic of the merchants (I Kings 10:14-15). The kingdom of Egypt, after regaining independence under Ahmose, a contemporary of Saul, also achieved grandeur and glory under Amenhotep I, Thutmose I, Hatshepsut, and Thutmose III.

And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great company, and camels that bare spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she com- muned with him of all that was in her heart. Is this story a fairy tale? Did a fairy queen come from a mysteri- ous land with jewels and other marvelous things? If she really came, did she find a splendid and generous king in Jerusalem and not a poor vassal prince who was never mentioned in the history of other countries? Many are inclined to believe that there is no historical basis for this legendary romance; others, who saw not fiction but real adven- ture in the story, unsuccessfully sought some historical remnants of the life and reign of the Queen of Sheba. 1 The land over which the Queen of Sheba ruled is identified by most scholars as the district of Saba (Sheba) in southern Arabia, the land of the \"Sabeans from the wilderness, which put bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful crowns upon their heads\" (Ezekiel 23:42). The Yemenites, the inhabitants of the land of Saba (Sheba) in Arabia Felix, believe that the Queen of Sheba was their queen, and with rich oriental imagery they ornament the story of her life and of her visit to Jerusalem. This view is supported by the Koran (Sura XXVII). But Ethiopia vies witib Arabia for the fame of the Queen of the South. The kings of Ethiopia claim descent from Menelik, a son of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, who, they insist, was their queen. They possess medieval manuscripts, with texts composed in the early Christian centuries, which carry this tradition. 2 Neither of the two Talmuds contains any clear historical reference *Cf. J.

Travelers have been unsuccessful though they have turned every stone in southern Arabia which promised an answer to the riddle. 5 The genealogy of the Abyssinian emperors, who wished to be recognized as the seed of Solomon and the Queen of the South, is accepted with the same lack of belief as all similar genealogies of kings and demigods. Research, which produced many treatises and commentaries, after exhausting all material, arrived at the conclusion expressed by one writer: \"We shall never know whether the queen who visited Solomon was a pure-blooded Abyssinian or an Arab queen from Yaman [Yemen] or Hadramaut or some other part of the great Arabian peninsula.

In the Jewish Antiquities of Josephus we find the story of the Queen of Sheba 7 introduced by these words: Now the woman who at that time ruled as queen of Egypt and Ethiopia was thoroughly trained in wisdom and remarkable in other ways, and, when she heard of Solomon's virtue and understanding, was led to him by a strong desire to see him which arose from the things told daily about his country. 8 Here we have a clear indication: \"queen of Egypt and Ethiopia. 9 * But Egyptian history, being removed some six hundred years from 'Compare Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Baba Batra 15b.

The most convincing proof, of course, would be presented if a record of the voyage to Jerusalem by Queen Hatshepsut were found and if it conformed with the account in the annals of the kings of Jerusalem. The record was written. It is preserved. And it conforms. Where Did Queen Hatshepsut Go?

Many theories concerning the location of the land of Punt have been advanced, but it has remained uncertain. Were it not for the bas-reliefs with the exotic animals and plants, the whereabouts of Punt probably would be no problem. The name of Punt or Divine (God's) Land is not accompanied by the sign designating a foreign country, showing that the Egyp- tians regarded Punt as a land affiliated in some way with Egypt. In a number of Egyptian inscriptions Punt is mentioned as situated to the east of Egypt.

There are also numerous inscriptions that mention products of Punt and God's Land as being obtained in Palestine (Retenu), and we shall read some of them in the following chapter. In an inscrip- tion in the tomb of a general of Thutmose IV, Palestine (Retenu) is called God's Land; a building inscription of Amenhotep III one generation later also refers to Palestine as God's Land. But all these points were not even considered by scholars who tried to locate Punt or God's Land. As the bas-reliefs of Deir el Bahari showed exotic animals and plants, zoologists and botanists were called by the historians to determine the place to which they were indigenous. 10 Palestine and Syria were never included among the possibilities. The elaborate pageant, the fauna and flora, created a division of opinion among the scholars. The majority of the population is north-Semitic or Caucasian, The animals and the few negroids are African. The plants are south-Arabian. God's (Divine) Land is often mentioned in the Egyptian inscriptions as the land which produced frankincense, and if the rare trees were these frankincense plants, they must have been of the Arabian variety, which is rich in foliage; the Somalian frankincense does not leaf as depicted in the bas- relief. 11 To account for the presence of the white people was easiest: they might have migrated to that country. 12 The people of Punt were Philo of Byblos as quoted by Eusebius in Preparation for the Gospel, I, 10, 27. *>\"Uin seine Lage genauer zu bestimmen, sind wir au$$chlte$slich auf die Abblldungen angewiesen, die von den Einwohnern und den Prodttkten des Landes uberltefert werden\" Glaser, Mitteilungen, Vorderasiatisch-tigyptische Geselkchaft, IV (1899), 53. \"Lucas, Ancient Egyptian Materials (2nd ed), p. 93. \"Glaser, Mitteilungen, Vorderasiattech-tigyptische GeseUschaft, 1899, p. 33f."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"THE QUEEN OF SHEBA 111 Phoenicians, as the name implies, and their presence in Somaliland could be inferred, as some authorities thought, from a passage in Herodotus, who wrote that the Phoenicians at an early date came from the Eritrean Sea to the Mediterranean, 13 and this seemed to sustain the theory that Punt was in eastern Africa.

Besides being much shorter, this route was preferred for various other reasons. The way across the Sinai Peninsula was not safe: It led through the last settlements of the Amalekites and Philistines, through Auaris and Gezer. Thutmose I, the father of Hatshepsut, carried on a campaign in this region, clearing it of rebellious bands of Amalekites and Philistines, and burning Gezer. The seaway was safer. Also a voyage by ship was more comfortable for the queen than a long journey in a chariot or in a palanquin, stopping at night to rest in tents pitched in the middle of the desert. Still another reason for traveling by sea was probably Hatshep- sut's desire to display the splendor of her new fleet, Solomon built a harbor in the Aqaba Gulf of the Red Sea. i KINGS 9:26 And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion- Geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom. Since the great cataclysm, when the maritime nations were lost together with their ships, daring ventures had been few and far between. For a long time the Atlantic Ocean was agitated by tec- tonic ruptures in a subsiding bottom. 3 When the Amalekites were destroyed and their allies, the Philis- tines, subjugated, the Phoenicians of Tyre and Sidon resumed their full maritime activity and sent their ships to \"the Great Circle** (the ocean).

On a tent is written: \"Pitching the tent of the king's messenger and his army on the myrrh-terraces of Punt on the side of the sea.\" 5 Since it is placed on the extreme lower part of the mural, a position of minor importance, this picture probably shows the preliminary expedition or the arrival of the herald of the queen. Paruah must have been Solomon's representative in the land of Edom, possibly an Edomite vassal of his. Among the twelve governors of King Solomon at a later period in his reign (when some of these officials were his sons-in-law) one was a son of Paruah (I Kings 4:17). Jehoshaphat, the son of Paruah, was governor in Ezion-Geber and Eloth; his father, appar- ently, administered the same region. 6 On the picture Paruah is an elderly man with no insignia of sovereign power. He is accompanied on this mission by his wife, disfigured by elephantiasis, and a few other members of his family, which indicates that he and his family were residents and probably natives of the place; he appears to have been the chief of Ezion- Geber. 4 Also in Kebra Nagast (trans.

Ezion-Geber was built by Solomon on the Gulf of Aqaba, where both shores can be seen. e lt appears that the last word in I Bangs 4:16 belongs to the next verse, and the last word of 4:17 to the following verse. The reading then would be: \". . * and in Aloth Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah.\" In this case the son remained governor where his father had served in the same capacity, Aloth and Eloth being the same. In a context having no relation to the question presented here, Albright (Journal of the Palestine Oriental Society, V [1925], 35) made the same suggestion that the place Aloth be transferred to the next verse, into the domain of Jehoshaphat, son of Paniah.

The picture of the expedition to Punt proves, however, that Josephus was not wrong: kussiim, the dark men of Ophir, were apparently brought by the sailors of Hiram and Solomon.

It is known that a waterway connecting the Nile and the Mediterranean with the Red Sea was dug by Pharaoh Necho II, many hundred years after Hatshepsut, and was finished much later, in the time of the Persian conquest 2 The Divine Land being recognized as the region of Jerusalem, no problem is encountered in the arrival of ships at Thebes on the Nile.

Although most of the temple of Queen Hatshepsut lies in ruin, portions of it which are still standing give a fair idea of the structure as it was before it was deserted and fell into decay. In every generation attempts have been made to reconstruct the Temple of Solomon in drawings or models, but the data in the First Book of Kings did not provide sufficient details, and the reconstruc- tors have had to draw upon their own imagination. The Temple of Jerusalem was built upon terraces planted with trees. These terraces were cut by an ascending path. The proces- sions of the Levites started on the lowest terrace, and as they sang they mounted the path. This explains the fact that some of their Psalms are called Shir ha-maaloth, \"song of the ascent/** The Temple in Jerusalem contained a hall which was three times as long as it was wide; in front of the hall was a vestibule; behind the hall was a sanctuary; the large \"sea\" was most probably placed in the inner court. The temple at Deir el Bahari was built against a mighty cliff; the Temple of Jerusalem stood upon an elevation with a distant chain of hills running northeast, east, and south of it. This difference in location must have influenced the architects to alter their plans. 5 S A. Mariette, Deir el Bahari, quoted by Naville in The Temple of Deir el Bahari, Introductory Memoir, p. 1.

But adoption of the style and general features of the plan is probable, and this is implied in the words of the queen that she ''built a Punt.\" A comparison of the data in Kings with the remnants of the temple of the Most Splendid may help to a better understanding of the form of both buildings. The temple of the Most Splendid of Splendors was a famous sanctuary. Several scholars have tried to reconstruct its plan. 6 This temple was built upon terraces planted with the trees brought from the Divine Land; the terraces were placed at progressively higher levels, and a path leading to the temple mounted from one level to another. Rows of pillars standing on a lower terrace supported the wall of the terrace above. The court of the temple was surrounded by a colonnade; the temple was divided into a vestibule, a hall, and a sanctuary. The ratio of tie width to the length of the hall was almost one to three. The pillars supporting the terraces and surrounding the inner court were rectangular in form; with their shadows, which changed with the movement of the sun, they 'imparted a harmonious and m'ajestic appearance, which only rectangular stone rhythmically arranged can give. It is erroneous to assert that the Temple of Solomon was a poor building of an obscure Asiatic chieftain who tried to construct a copy of some Egyptian temple. 7 Not only the temple architecture but also the temple service in Egypt were given many new features.

This question had already been debated before the time of Plutarch, and he quoted the opinions of the authorities without finding any of them satisfactory. One ancient authority regarded \"pontifex\" as composed of the Latin roots pons, pontis, \"a bridge,\" and facio, \"I make.\" The philological conjecture was: The pontifex was a man who built bridges, or the principal magistrate; the chief of the people, who united in his person civil and religious prerogatives. This explanation is obviously very strained, Another authority thought that the first pontiffs were so called because sacrifices were supposed to have been made on a bridge (faciebant in ponte).* This explanation is even more strained.

It is not derived from pons y but probably from Punt. When it is said that Queen Hatshep- sut, after visiting Punt, built a \"punt\" for the god Amon, this means a sacred place of worship. By erecting a \"punt\" in Egypt, Queen Hat- shepsut also introduced the institution of the high priest, copying the service of the Temple in Jerusalem, built on a Phoenician model. Solomon's alliance with Hiram, the king of the Phoenicians, ex- plains the strong Phoenician influence in the life of the kingdom of Judah and Israel. This influence is stressed in the Scriptures in the story of the erection of the Temple, built with the help of Hiram, who provided Solomon with building material and with the chief craftsman, a man of Hebrew-Phoenician origin (I Kings 7:13-14). Also the common expedition to Ophir and the peaceful transfer of territory from the domain of one long to that of the other (I Kings 9:11) might have brought it about that the whole of Palestine at that time was called Phoenicia. The name Punt being the origin of the word \"pontiff\" (pontifex), what is the origin of the name Punt? In the Scriptures the Phoenicians are called \"the men of Sidon and Tyre\" or \"the men of Hiram\"; the name Phoenicia does not ap- pear. \"Phoenicians\" was the name used by Greek and Latin authors since Homer. 2 Rome waged so-called \"Punic Wars\" against Car- thage, which was built by immigrants from Tyre. It is believed that the Greek explanation of the word \"Phoeni- cians\" as \"the red men\" 8 is but a successful adjustment in the style of folk-etymology, although the travels of the Phoenicians to the Western Hemisphere and their contacts with the cultures of the Mayas and Incas were taken into consideration by many scholars who studied pre-Columbian America.

With colorful imagination Kebra Nagast recounts the bridal night of Solomon and the Queen of the South; among the presents he gave her there were \"a vessel wherein one could travel over the sea, and a vessel wherein one could travel by air.\" When the queen returned to her country, \"her officials who had remained there brought gifts to their mistress, and made obeisance to her, and did homage to her, and all the borders of the country rejoiced at her coming. . . .

The Ethiopians call the Queen of the South Makeda.

There may have been a chronological reason, too, for such a hypothetical Copt to identify Hatshepsut with the Queen of the South, or he might have heard a legend that the reliefs of Deir el Bahari do represent a voyage to Jerusalem. The same theory could be applied to Josephus, who might have written \"queen of Egypt and Ethiopia\" on the basis of the scenes of the bas- reliefs at Deir el Bahari; he might have mentioned the kussiim (negroids) because they were in the picture. This is a forced con- struction (Josephus was never in Egypt); on the other hand, the historical facts known to Josephus and not preserved in the Scrip- tures must have been transmitted by some means during the one thousand years which separated Josephus from Solomon.

The actual successor to Hatshepsut on the Egyptian throne was the one who sacked the Temple, a deed attributed to the putative son of Solomon and the Queen of the South. We took a short leave of the historical material to investigate the Abyssinian legend, and now we should like also to take a look at one or two Hebrew legends about the Queen of Sheba. Having become acquainted with the historical person, we are interested to know what stimulated the folk fantasy and how it worked. We have already mentioned the divine command heard by Queen Hatshepsut compelling her to undertake her expedition to the Divine Land. On the murals, in the coronation scene and in other scenes, Hatshepsut is portrayed before the god Horus with the head of a hawk; a serpent of Lower Egypt or a vulture of Upper Egypt, as royal emblems, are also often pictured with her. A curious legend in the Haggada 10 narrates that the Queen of Sheba, while on her way one morning to pay homage to the god of the sun, received a message from a bird summoning her to visit Solomon in Jerusalem. In the inscriptions Hatshepsut is called king; the pronoun used for her is sometimes \"she\" and sometimes \"he\"; on the pictures her raiment is that of a king. She is called the daughter of Amon, but in the picture of her birth a boy is molded by Khnum, the shaper of men. It was unusual, and contrary to the political and religious con- ceptions of the Egyptians, to have a woman ruling on the throne; 8 G. A.

There is a well-known legend that Solomon, at his first meeting with the Queen of Sheba, said to her about the hair on her skin (her legs were reflected in a mirrored floor): \"Thy hair is masculine; hair is an ornament to a man, but it disfigures a woman.\" 11 Rabbi Jonathan in the third century of the present era maintained that it was a king and not a queen of Sheba who visited Solomon. Egyptologists of the first half of the nineteenth century pictured and described Hatshepsut as a king, being misled by some of her statues and the masculine pronoun she applied to herself. Could it be that, a few centuries after Hatshepsut, the pictures of Deir el Bahari, seen by visitors to Egypt, gave rise to these two strange legends? Did Hatshepsut Visit the Land of the Queen of Sheba? The Queen of Sheba who visited King Solomon lived in the tenth century before this era. It is not known whence she came from the land of Saba or from Ethiopia. In the sixteenth century before this era Queen Hatshepsut undertook an expedition to the Divine Land and Punt. It is not known where Punt was, but it is thought that it was either in the land of Saba or on the Somali shore of Ethiopia. Accordingly Queen Hatshepsut might have visited the land of the Queen of Sheba six centuries before this queen made her voyage to Jerusalem. As the \"marvels'* brought by Hatshepsut from Punt are not unlike the \"marvels\" brought by Hiram and Solomon from Ophir, a few authors have ventured to identify Punt and Ophir, though the whereabouts of the latter place has not yet been established. Ac- cording to that theory, the Phoenician king Hiram undertook a voyage of discovery to Punt, visited by Hatshepsut centuries earlier. 1 u lbid., IV, 145. ^aspero, The Struggle of the Nations, p. 742.

Consequently, I have argued: It is said about Solomon that his fame spread to faraway countries, and all kings sought his presence; the same is told of Queen Hatshepsut; if they were contemporaries, it is strange that they should not have come in contact with each other. To prove that the Queen of Sheba and Queen Hatshepsut were one and the same person, I had to show that the Queen of Sheba came from Egypt and that Queen Hatshepsut visited Palestine. Re- garding the former, there is a definite statement by Josephus that the queen came from Egypt. This statement has been unduly neglected. Fortunately we also have an illustrated diary of Queen Hatshepsut, which gives an account of an expedition to a foreign country. That she participated in the expedition is not difficult to establish by explicit statements, in which she calls herself the leader of the expedition. I also had to show that Punt and the Divine Land are Phoenicia and Palestine. Repeated references to Punt as a country east of Egypt exclude Somaliland. The return of the ships of the expedition to the Nile harbor of Thebes excludes southern Arabia and Somali- land and places Punt on the shore of the Mediterranean.

The people of the \"Caucasian\" or \"north-Semitic race\" were the Jews. The chief Paruah who met the expedition of Hatshepsut in the harbor was the governor of Solomon in Ezionr Geber. The apes and other exotic animals, which led the historians lo the conclusion that Punt was in Africa, were actually brought to Jerusalem on the ships of Solomon and Hiram. The exotic plants were also brought from afar. There remains to be explained the provenance of one plant ex- ported from Punt. Long before the expedition of Queen Hatshepsut and for some time thereafter, Punt and Divine Land were repeatedly mentioned in Egyptian documents as places producing frankincense. Because of the frankincense, Punt was thought to be in southern Arabia. I leave it for the next chapter to show that frankincense grew in Palestine. 2 Shwa (the Hebrew for Sheba) might be the last part of the name Hatshep- sut. R.

The bas-reliefs of the Punt expedition show the young prince as a small figure in the back- ground, bringing an offering of incense to the bark of Amon-Ra. Later, when he reigned alone, Thutmose III became the greatest of all the conquerors who sat on the throne of the New Kingdom in Egypt. His military expeditions were directed into Palestine and Syria, He subdued these countries; some of the cities were vanquished by force; others bowed before him, opened their gates, and became tributaries. The records of his military successes, cut in hieroglyphics on the walls of the great Amon temple in Karnak, recount his campaigns in Palestine and Syria. A list of one hundred and nineteen cities in Palestine is engraved three times on the walls of that temple. Each city is represented by a man with his arms bound behind him, and a shield covering the body of the man bears the name of the city he symbolizes. Another list, imperfect and in one copy, shows almost three hundred Syrian cities as captives, also as men bound and with shields on their breasts.

It is also sometimes said that if the Israelites in his day* had already become organized into a tribal sept they were still obscure nomads in the highlands between the Euphrates and the Nile.

The conquest by Thutmose III was a triumphant sweep across Palestine, and the chronicles of Judah and Israel could not possibly have omitted it; indeed, a conspicuous record of it must be there. Once more this reconstruction is put to the test. The absence of a scriptural record of the conquest of Palestine by an invading Egyp- tian army under the personal leadership of a pharaoh, in the years following the reign of Solomon, would be regarded as irrefutable evidence against it. But this record is preserved in the Scriptures, and it coincides completely with the Karnak inscriptions.

But Egypt rewarded good with evil. The tales of the splendor of Jerusalem, enriched by conquest and trade, inspired Hatshepsut with the desire to behold its wealth herself. Thutmose III, as a young prince, either participated in this expedition into \"God's Land\" or heard from Hatshepsut about the \"luxurious land of delight\"; and he saw the gifts which were said to be marvels. The bas-reliefs of the Punt expedition were bound to keep those experiences fresh in his mind. His eye looked with envy on that land and on the wealth accumulated there. Solomon, whose name is a synonym for a wise, even the wisest, man, must be charged with most grievous political errors. In the latter part of his reign the builder of the Temple in Jerusalem be- came a worshiper of strange gods and a builder of high places to them. It is said that he built on the hills around Jerusalem sanctu- aries to foreign deities because of the strange women he loved: **. . . his wives turned away his heart\" (I Kings 11:4). Solomon planned, through his marriages with the daughter of Pharaoh and with the \"women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edom- ites, Zidonians, and Hittites,\" to build a cosmopolitan center at Jerusalem. In erecting shrines to strange gods, he thought that Jerusalem, as the abode of the deities of foreign nations, would demonstrate his tolerance and that Jerusalem would become the gathering place for various religions and cults. Since the Egyptian princess is mentioned as the first among the wives of Solomon, the statue of Amon-Ra, the official supreme god of Egypt, should have been among the gods of all of Solomon's \"strange wives\" (I Kings 11:5-8). Among the murals of the Punt expedition, one, defaced by a chisel, contained an inscription, and from the few words which re- main it can be understood that a statue, obviously of the god Amon-Ra, was erected in the Divine Land. 1 The statues o pagan *K.

In the days of Saul and David the state attained independence. The heyday of imperialistic power was very short, political ascendancy reaching its culmination in the reign of Solomon; at the end of his reign the rapid decline started. Three adversaries rose against Solomon, and they began to rend his realm apart.

The conquest of the walled cities is the phase of the war related in the beginning of the annals of Thutmose III which have been preserved. The second phase is the move on the capital. Jerusalem, against which the pharaoh advanced, must have been the city of Kadesh. This one answer serves two questions: Why was Jerusalem not on the list of Thutmose III, and Where was the long-city of Kadesh? Is Jerusalem anywhere else called Kadesh?

The name Kadesh is used for Jerusalem not in Hebrew texts alone. The names of the most obscure Arab villages in Palestine were scrutinized by the scholars in biblical lore in an endeavor to locate the ancient cities, but the Arab name for Jerusalem was over- looked: it is el-Kuds (the Holy, or the Holiness). Kadesh, the first among the Palestinian cities, was Jerusalem. The \"wretched foe,\" the king of Kadesh, was Rehoboam. Among the one hundred and nineteen cities were many which the scholars did not dare to recognize: they were built when Israel was already settled in Canaan.

The strongholds of the land west- ward from Jerusalem had fallen; the strongest of them, defended by the king of Jerusalem, opened its gates after the king and his escort had escaped and returned to Jerusalem. n CHRONICLES 12:5 ... the princes of Judah . . . were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak. The land only a few years before had been rent in two. Judah, weakened by the separation of the northern kingdom, was unable to defend itself. The prophet Shemaiah, who, four years earlier, had warned the people against engaging in a fraternal war, came to the king and to the princes of Judah with a wrathful message from the Lord, for- saken by the people of Jerusalem. The king and the princes abased themselves, and the king said: \"The Lord is righteous.\" Then Shemaiah came with another message: n CHRONICLES 12:7f. ... I will grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak. Nevertheless they shall be his servants. Because they did not wish to be the servants of the Lord, they would be servants of an earthly kingdom. This was said in the name of the Lord. And the Egyptian king and his army, who at Megiddo \"gave praise to Amon for the victory he granted to his son,\" certainly repeated their praise at the walls of Jerusalem. After the fall of \"the fenced cities which pertained to Judah,\" Jerusalem opened its gates without offering resistance. \"Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves/' and they were \"not destroyed,\" and the Lord's wrath was \"not poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.\" The city was not stormed. There is no record of any storming of Kadesh by Thutmose III. But Kadesh in Palestine fell to Thutmose III and its name heads the list of Palestinian cities captured by him. The humbling of the princes of Judah after the fall of Megiddo is described also by Thutmose III in these words: Behold, the chiefs of this country came to render their portions, to do obeisance to the fame of his majesty, to crave breath for their"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLE IN JERUSALEM 155 nostrils, because o the greatness of his power, because of the might of the fame of his majesty. 16 \"The greatness of his power\" is also mentioned in the Hebrew version \"the twelve hundred chariots, and sixty thousand horse- men, and the people without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubim, the Sukkiim, and the Ethiopians.\" The indignant Lord humiliated Jerusalem, which erected statues of Egyptian., Sidonian, and other deities on the hills around Jerusa- lem; soon the god with the head of a ram would receive all the splendor from Solomon's Temple, every removable precious thing. n CHRONICLES 12:9 So Shishak long of Egypt came up against Jeru- salem, and took away the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king's house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made. There remained the old Ark of the Covenant, a worthless piece, a relic of the desert, together with the stones of the Commandments. Was Egypt poor in old steles? The Vessels and Furniture of Solomon's Temple The treasures brought by Thutmose III from Palestine are re- produced on a wall of the Karnak temple. The bas-relief displays in ten rows the legendary wealth of Solo- mon. There are pictures of various precious objects, furnishings, vessels, and utensils of the Temple, of the palace, probably also of the shrines to foreign deities. Under each object a numerical symbol indicates how many of that kind were brought by the Egyptian king from Palestine: each stroke means one piece, each arch means ten pieces, each spiral one hundred pieces of the same thing. If Thut- mose III had wanted to boast and to display all his spoils from the Temple and the Palace of Jerusalem by showing each object separately instead of using this number system, a wall a mile long would have been required and even that would not have sufficed. In the upper five rows the objects of gold are presented; in the next \"Breasted, Records, Vol. II, Sec. 434."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"156 AGES IN CHAOS rows silver tilings are mingled with those of gold and precious stones; objects of bronze and semiprecious stones are in the lower rows. Wealth accumulated by a nation during hundreds of years of industrious work and settled life in Palestine, spoils gathered by Saul and David in their military expeditions, loot of the Amalekite Auaris, earnings from the trade between Asia and Africa, gold from Ophir, the gifts of the queen Sheba-Hatshepsut, all became the booty of Thutmose III. The work of Huram, of the tribe of Naphtali, is reproduced on the walls of the Karnak temple; Huram and his workmen were skilled artisans, and the hand of their royal master, Solomon, supplied them lavishly with precious metal and stone, 1 Specimens of the skill of David's craftsmen must also be found in this exhibit, for I KINGS 7:51 ... Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the Lord. The sacred objects wrought by the ancient master Bezaleel, son of Uri, 2 may also have been reproduced here. An exhaustive ^identification of objects pictured in the Karnak temple and of those described in the Books of Kings and Chronicles is a matter for prolonged study and should preferably be done with the help of molds from the bas-reliefs at Karnak. The following short excursus is not intended to be complete and definitive; it is only tentative. Yet it will demonstrate the identity of the booty of Thut- mose III with that carried out of Jerusalem by the Egyptian king in the days of Rehoboam, son of Solomon. A large part of the booty of Thutmose III consisted of religious objects taken from a temple. There were altars for burnt offerings and incense, tables for the sacrifice, lavers for liquid offerings, vessels for sacred oil, tables for showbread, and the like in great quantity. No doubt it was an extremely rich temple that was pillaged by Thutmose III. The objects taken by Shishak from Jerusalem were the treasures a l Kings 7:13-45; H Chronicles 4:11-22.

On the Karnak bas-relief Thutmose III is shown presenting certain objects to the god Amon: these objects are the part of the king's booty which he dedicated to the temple of Amon and gave to the Egyptian priests. This picture does not represent the whole booty of Thutmose III. He chose for the Egyptian temples what he took from the foreign Temple, and in this collection of \"cunning work\" one has to look for the objects enumerated in the sections of the Books of Kings and of Chronicles describing the Temple. On the walls of the tomb chambers of Thutmose's viziers treasures are shown in the process of transportation from Palestine. Be- sides the art work familiar from the scene of presentation to Amon, there are also other objects, apparently from the palace. These were delivered to Pharaoh's palace and to the houses of his favorites. The books of the Scriptures have preserved a detailed record of furniture and vessels of the Temple only. Fortunately the separation of the sacral booty in the scene of dedication to Amon makes the task of recognition easier. The metals used and the style of the craftsmanship will be com- pared briefly in the Hebrew and Egyptian sources. The material of which the objects were made is indicated by accompanying inscrip- tions on the bas-relief; they were made of three different metals, translated as gold, silver, and bronze. The metals used for the sacral furniture and for the vessels in the Temple of Solomon were of gold, silver, and bronze (Tbrass\"). The \"cunning work\" was manufactured of each of these metals. Often an article is represented on the wall in gold and another of the same shape in brass. The fashioning of identical objects in gold as well as in bronze (brass) for the Temple of Solomon is repeatedly referred to in the Books of Kings and of Chronicles. When gold was used for the vessels and the furnishings of Solomon's Temple, it was either solid gold 3 or a hammered gold overlay on wood.* The pictures of the objects in Karnak are de- scribed by the words \"gold\" and \"overlaid with gold.* ft l Kings 7:48-50; II Chronicles 4:7, 8, 21, 22. *I Kings 6:20, 21, 28, 30, 32, 35; II Chronicles 3:7, 9."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"158 AGES IN CHAOS In the period when Israel had no permanent site for its place of worship, the Ark of the Covenant and other holy objects were moved from one place to another and were sometimes taken into battle. In order to facilitate transportation, the furnishings of the tabernacle were made with rings and bars. 6 The old furniture of the tabernacle was placed in the Temple by Solomon, and was carried off, in the days of his son, by the pharaoh and his army. The Ark of the Covenant, however, was not removed but remained in the Temple until the Babylonian exile. 7 It was probably a model for other transportable sacred paraphernalia used in the holy en- closure in Beth-el and in Shiloh and thereafter in Jerusalem. In the second and seventh rows of the Karnak bas-relief are shown various ark-shaped chests with rings at the corners and bars for transporta- tion. \"A crown of gold round about\" was an ancient Judean ornament of sacred tables and altars. 8 Such ornamentation is seen on the golden altar in the second row (9) of the mural, as well as on the bronze (brass) altar in the ninth row (177). The preferred ornament on the vessels was the shoshana, trans- lated as Tily\" (lotus). i KINGS 7:26 . . . the brim thereof [of the molten sea] was wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies. The lotus motif is often repeated on the vessels reproduced on the wall of Karnak. A lotus vial is shown in gold (10), in silver (121), and in colored stone (malachite?) (140). A rim of lily work may be seen on various vessels (35, 75, 175), a very unusual type of rim ornament, found only in the scriptural account and on the bas-reliefs of Thutmose III. Buds among flowers (\"his knops and his flowers'* 10 ) were also used \"Exodus 37: 3, 13-14. I Kings 8:4. 7 Seder Olam 25. Other sources in Ginzberg, Legends, VI, 380. 8 Exodus 37 ill, 12,25.

This motif appears on a vase (195) in the lower row of the Karnak mural and also in the fifth row (75). Of animal figures, lions and oxen are mentioned as decorative motifs of the Temple in Jerusalem (I Kings 7:29 and 36). The Kar- nak mural shows lion heads (20, 60), and the head of an ox is recog- nizable as an ornament on a drinking vessel (132). Gods were often depicted in Egyptian temples in shameless posi- tions. Among the figures of sacred objects on the Karnak bas-relief there are none of phallic form, neither are there any pictures of gods at all. A few animal heads (lions) with the sign of the uraeus on their foreheads and the head of a hawk are wrought on the lids of some cups. These cups might have been brought from the palace Solomon had built for his Egyptian wife. Idols were and still are used in all pagan worship. The hundreds of sacred objects appearing in the mural were obviously not of an idolatrous cult; they suggest, rather., a cult in which offerings of animals, incense, and showbread were brought, but in which no idols were worshiped. The Temple of Kadesh-Jerusalem, sacked by Thutmose III, was rich in utensils for religious services but devoid of any image of a god. Piece by piece the altars and vessels of Solomon's Temple can be identified on the wall of Karnak. In the Temple of Solomon there was an altar of gold for burnt offerings (I Kings 7:48; II Chronicles 4:19). It was the only such altar. In the second row of the bas-reliefs is an altar with a crown around the edge, partly destroyed, but partly plainly discernible (9). The inscription reads: \"The [a] great altar.'* It was made of gold. Another altar in the Temple of Jerusalem was of \"brass\" (bronze); it was square and very large. 11 In the ninth row of the Karnak relief an altar of \"brass** (bronze) is pictured, the shape of which is similar to that of the gold altar. The inscription says (177) : \"One great altar of brass [bronze].\" Inasmuch as its height is equal to its width, the altar does not fit the description of the altar mentioned in ^Twenty cubits square, ten cubits in height ( II Chronicles 4:1)."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"160 AGES IN CHAOS the Second Book of Chronicles, which was half as high as it was wide. However, from the first chapter of the Second Book of Chronicles we know that another brazen altar made by Bezaleel was among the holy objects of the Temple at Jerusalem. Next to the altar was the table \"whereupon the shewbread was\" (I Kings 7:48; II Chronicles 4:19). The showbread was obviously not of flour, but of silver or gold; in the Book of Exodus 12 it is said that showbread was made by Bezaleel, who was a goldsmith. Show- bread is pictured on the bas-relief of Karnak in the form of a cone, The cone in the seventh row (138) bears the explanation: \"White bread.\" This bread was of silver. The thirty cones of gold (48) and the twenty-four cones of colored stone (malachite) (169), identical in form with the silver cone, also represent showbread. The \"candlestick with the lamps\" (II Chronicles 4:20) was an illuminating device with lamps shaped like flowers. Figures 35, 36, 37, and 38 of the mural are candlesticks with lamps. One of them (35) has three lily lamps on the left and three on the right. The other candlesticks (37, 38) have eight lamps to the left and eight to the right. The candlestick with lamps wrought by Bezaleel for the tabernacle had three lamps to the left and three to the right 13 There were almonds, a knop, and a flower on the arms. A later form showed a preference for seven lamps on both sides of the stem. Other candlesticks are mentioned in addition to those with lamps. In the Book of Kings they are described as bearing flowers (I Kings 7:49). This form is seen in the third row of the bas-relief (25, 26, 27, and 28).

In the third row of the Karnak mural, near the table of offerings, and in the same row at the left end, there are hooks, spoons, and other implements (30, 31, 32, 33, 43, 44); bowls appear in most of the rows, but especially in the second and sixth (of gold). \"The incense altar, and his staves, and the anointing oil\" were in the Temple of Jerusalem (Exodus 35:15). As no detailed description of the form of this altar is given in the Scriptures, various objects in the form of altars suitable for incense may be considered. Did the smoke of the burning incense pour through the openings in the ornamental spouts? Was the incense burned in a dish set on a base (41, 181)? Vessels containing anointing oil are shown on pedestal altars (41); over the figures in the lower row (197-99) is written: \"Alabaster, filled with holy anointing oil for the sacrifice.\" Golden snuffers were used in the Temple of Solomon for spread- ing the fragrance during the service (II Chronicles 4:22; I Kings 7:50). Masrek in Hebrew means a fountain or a vessel that ejects a fluid. Such fountains are mentioned as having been in the Temple of Solomon (I Kings 7:50; II Chronicles 4:22). Among the vessels shown on the wall at Karnak there are one or two whose form is peculiar. The vessel in the fifth row (73) has two side spouts and is adorned with figures of animals. The spouts are connected with the basin by two animals (lions?) stretching toward them; rodents run along the spouts, one pair up and one pair down; amphibians (frogs) sit on top of the vessel. It is not unusual to decorate mod- ern fountains in a like manner. The figures of frogs are especially appropriate for this purpose. The tubes and the mouths of the animals on the vessel could be used to spout perfume or water. The neighboring object seems also to be a fountain. One hundred basins of gold were made by Solomon for the Temple (II Chronicles 4:8). Ninety-five basins of gold are shown in the sixth row of the mural; six larger basins are shown apart.

Pharaoh, who \"took all,\" did not leave this gold or these stones on the walls. Some o them were worked into jewels, and the inscription (over 63-65) reads: \"Gold and various precious stones his majesty had reworked.\" Other gold was taken in the form of bricks and links (chains) (23, 24). Chains of gold are also men- tioned as having been in the Temple of Solomon (II Chronicles 3:16): \"And he made chains.\" Thirty-three doors are represented in the lower row of the bas- relief and the inscription says they are \"of beaten copper\" (190). n CHRONICLES 4:9 Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with copper. 14 Targets or shields of \"beaten gold\" are named among the booty of the pharaoh (II Chronicles 9:15). These three hundred shields, together with the two hundred targets of gold (II Chronicles 9:15, 16), were not part of the furnishings of the Temple; they adorned \"the house of the forest of Lebanon.\" In the seventh row of the mural there are three disks marked with the number 300, which means that they represent three hundred pieces. The metal of which they are made is not mentioned; some objects in this row are of silver, but the next figure has a legend indicating that it is of gold. The large \"sea of brass\" and the brazen bases (I Kings 7:23; II Chronicles 4:2) were not removed by the pharaoh (II Kings 25:16). Among the things which were taken later by Nebuzaradan, the captain of Nebuchadnezzar, were \"two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made for the House of the Lord.\" 15 The ephod of the high priest (a collar with a breastplate) was not mentioned in the Scriptures among the booty of the pharaoh and might not have been taken. But precious garments of the priests u Necho$het is translated both \"brass\" and copper. However, it was either copper or bronze (alloy of copper with tin); brass (alloy of copper with zinc) was introduced much later. ^11 Kings 25:16, A few gold vessels might have been saved by the priests under Rehoboam, as it is said that Nebuchadnezzar took vessels of gold which Solomon had made for the Temple (II Kings 24:13).

The naval base at Ezion-Geber was no longer controlled by Judah. The maritime expeditions of the Israelites in company with the sailors of Tyre and Sidon were not repeated. Megiddo, which guarded the road between Jerusalem and Sidon, became the chief Egyptian stronghold in Syria-Palestine.

Jaffa fell to a general of Thutmose III; 1 the fleet of the Phoenicians, or part of it, was seized by Thutmose III a few years later. The north- ern realm of Israel, ruled by a puppet king, a tool in the hands of the pharaoh, did not need to be conquered. Jeroboam came from Egypt, where he was trained for his task. It is only logical, therefore, to expect that the land of Israel would voluntarily pay tribute to Thutmose III.

How, then, explain the presence of these plants among those brought by Thut- mose III from Palestine? \"Possibly, the twofold geographical designation, Palestine and God's Land, could be explained by the fact that a number of plants actually came from God's Land.

We know that the ships of Tharshish brought back peacocks (I Kings 10:22; II Chronicles 9:21); surely Solomon collected not merely one species of birds. And it was his zoological garden that was carried by the pharaoh to Egypt as well as the treasures of his Temple and palace. Today, in the reliefs of Deir el Bahari and Karnak, we may gaze on the people of Judah of the days of Solomon, the animals and the pknts they raised, and the objects they cherished. Genubath, King of Edom Edom, like Israel, was ruled by a chief appointed by the Theban king. Hadad the Edomite had a son by the sister of Tahpenes, the queen of Ahmose, and his name was Genubath. i ZINGS 11:20 And the sister of Tahpenes bore him [Hadad] Genu- bath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house: and Genu- bath was in Pharaoh's household among the sons of Pharaoh. Hadad had returned to Edom in the days of Solomon, after the death of Joab. 1 Since then about forty years had elapsed. Genubath, his son, was now the vassal king of Edom; he dwelt either in Edom or in Egypt. Tribute from this land, too, must have been sent to the Egyptian crown; there was no need to send an expedition to subdue Edom. When Thutmose III returned from one of his inspection visits to Palestine he found in Egypt tribute brought by couriers from T M. Hilzheimer, quoted by Wreszinski, Atlas, Pt.

Who were the people of Genubatye? Hardly a guess has been made with regard to this peculiar name. The people of Genubatye were the people of Genubath, their long, contemporary of Rehoboam. The year before, in the seventh year after the campaign of Me- giddo and Jerusalem, Thutmose III, using his stronghold of Megiddo as a base and assisted by the fleet captured from the Sidonians, pushed northward to Arvad. \"On his return to Egypt he took with him the children of the native princes to be educated in friendship toward Egypt, that they might be sent back gradually to replace the old hostile generation of Syrian princes.\" 8 Behold, the children of the chiefs and their brothers were brought to be in strongholds in Egypt. Now whosoever died among these chiefs, his majesty would cause his son to stand in his place. 4 This is a policy .similar to that applied in the case of Hadad and Genubath, the Edomites. Princess Ano In the Greek version of the Old Testament the Septuagint made in Alexandria in Egypt in the third century before the present era, there is found the information that when Jeroboam heard in Egypt of Solomon's death he spoke in the ears of the king of Egypt, saying, \"Let me go,- and I will depart into my land.\" And Susakim (Shishak) gave to Jeroboam to be his wife Ano, the eldest sister of Thelkemina, his own wife.

In the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York there is pre- served a canopic jar bearing the name of Princess Ano. 2 The time when the jar originated has been established on stylistic grounds as that of Thutmose III. No other references to a princess of such name is found in any Egyptian source or document. The existence of a princess by the name of Ano in the days of Thutmose III lends credence to the information contained in the Septuagint and gives additional support to the identification of Shishak or Susakim of the Septuagint with the pharaoh we know by the name Thutmose III. \"The Astounding Civilization\" In addition to the bas-reliefs on the walls of Karnak, a number of other monuments show the wealth brought from Palestine by Thut- mose III.

It is therefore of interest to read what role the modern historians ascribe to the Canaanites in the process of the development of Egyptian art and in the refinement of the Egyptian race; it is an opinion as unbiased as criticism of the works of an artist whose name is concealed by a pseudonym. \"At this time (Thutmosis III, 1503-1449) the Syrians stood at a higher stage of civilization than even the wonderfully gifted race of Egypt.

Egypt had never known such changes since the beginning of the monarchy.\" 4 It is also worth while to notice the chariots, gold-plated and inlaid with silver, captured by Thutmose III in Palestine. \"The song of songs, which is Solomon's\" is supposed to be a creation of a late period, and the mention of luxury in the time of Solomon is thought to be a product of the poet's fancy. \"King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon. He made the pillars thereof of silver, the bottom thereof of gold, the covering of it of purple.\" The Egyptian monuments show that in the fifth year after Solomon, in Jerusalem and also in Megiddo, there was not one but many chariots of gold and silver. We thus discard our supposed knowledge of the Canaanite art of the sixteenth and fifteenth centuries before the present era, and we begin to acquire some knowledge of the Jewish art of the tenth century, about which the history of art was thought to be ignorant. God's Land and Rezenu 1 The present chapter shows the conquest of Palestine by Thutmose III to have taken place, not in the Canaanite period, but in the days of the Jewish kings, and more precisely in the fifth year of Reho- boam, son of Solomon. In the preceding chapter the expedition of Queen Hatshepsut to the land of Punt was shown to have taken place in the days of King Solomon, and the land visited to have been Judea and probably Phoenicia too. In other words, we assume that Queen Hatshepsut on her peaceful journey and Thutmose on his military expeditions visited the same country. We are now in a position that will either trap us or furnish us with additional proof that Queen Hatshepsut went to Palestine on her famous expedition, and not to eastern Africa. Is not this .point es- sential for the identification of Queen Hatshepsut with the Queen of Sheba? *R. W. Rogers, Cuneiform Parallels to the Old Testament (2nd ed., New York and Cincinnati, 1926), p. 255. a Eduard Meyer reads \"Rezenu.\" Breasted transliterates \"Retenu.\""},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLE IN JERUSALEM 171 The assumption that the people of God's Land in the pictures of Hatshepsut were people of Palestine can be easily proved or dis- proved by comparing these pictures with the figures of men with shields on the Karnak mural symbolizing the conquest of Palestine. In both cases Egyptian artists of practically the same generation did the sculpturing. They were masters in depicting die characteristic features of different races. Drawings of various ages are preserved in which Egyptian artists have made collections of racial types. A glance at the people of God's Land, the \"people of the South/' and die Egyptians on the bas-reliefs of the expedition to Punt may help us to understand the fine feeling these artists possessed for ex- pressing the types of their own and of foreign races. The same characteristic profiles, the same hair styles, with a ribbon around the hair tied behind, and the same long beard shaped as a prolongation of a pointed chin make it certain that types of one and the same people were pictured on the bas-reliefs of both Hat- shepsut and Thutmose III. But, one might ask, if Thutmose III went to the same country to which Hatshepsut had gone two or three decades earlier, why did he not call the country of his conquest, Rezenu (Palestine), by the same names that Hatshepsut called it, God's Land and Punt? Year after year Thutmose III returned to Palestine to collect tribute (II Chronicles 12:8: \". . . they shall be his servants\"). Three years after the conquest of Megiddo, Kadesk, and other cities, he had carved on the walls at Karnak pictures of trees and plants that he had brought from Palestine, with this inscription, already quoted: \"Plants which his majesty found in the land of Retenu. All plants that grow, all flowers that are in God's Land which were found by his majesty when his majesty proceeded to Upper Retenu.\" 2 This sentence induced the translator to conjecture that \"God's Land is sometimes applied to Asia.\" 8 The sixth campaign of Thutmose III, like the first, was military: he conquered the north of Syria. Three years later he went to Pales- tine to gather the levy. After describing the tribute obtained from Shinar and Kheta and the land of Naharin, the register reads: \"Breasted, Records, VoL n, Sec. 451. \"Ibid., note to Sec. 451,"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"172' AGES IN CHAOS \"Marvels brought to his majesty in the land of Punt in this year: dried myrrh . . .\" The translator was surprised by this phrase. 4 We find that Thutmose III used the same terms as Hatshepsut Punt and God's Landfor the land they visited Phoenicia-Palestine. The question that arises is: Did Palestine produce myrrh, re- ferred to in the account of the tribute, and frankincense, mentioned among the gifts Hatshepsut received in God's Land? Myrrh and frankincense are repeatedly mentioned in Egyptian inscriptions as products of Punt. Frankincense (olibanum) falls in dear drops which, when gathered and formed into balls or sticks, turn white. Because of its color the precious incense is called \"white** in various languages (Greek, Arabic), likewise in Hebrew (lebana, white). The less precious incense, ladanum, is yellow or brown in color. 5 Frankincense grows in only a very few places, Somaliland and southern Arabia on opposite shores of the Red Sea being areas which produce it even today. The botanists were guides to the archaeologists in search of the land of Punt. After his fifth visit of inspection to conquered Syria and Palestine, Thutmose III listed frankincense, oil, honey, and wine as tribute. Following his ninth visit, he stated that he had received as \"Retenu tribute in this year\" horses, chariots, various silver vessels of the workmanship of the country, and also \"dry myrrh, incense 693 jars, sweet oil and green oil 2080 jars, and wine 608 jars.\" Of his seventh campaign he wrote: \"Tribute of the princes of Retenu, who came to do obeisance. . . . Now, every harbor at which his majesty arrived was supplied with loaves and with assorted loaves, with oil, incense, wine, honey, fruit abundant were they be- yond everything. . . . The harvest of the land of Retenu was re- ported consisting of much dean grain, grain in the kernel [not ground], barley, incense [frankincense], green oil, wine, fruit, every pleasing thing of the country/' 8 Myrrh and frankincense were products of Palestine. Let us see whether the Scriptures give any indication that they were products of the Holy Land in the days of Solomon. In the \"Song of songs, *Ibid., Sec. 486. \"See Lucas, Ancient Egyptian Materials (2nd ed.), p. 92. ^Breasted, Records, VoL II, Sees. 471-73."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLE IN JERUSALEM 173 which is Solomon's/' the enamored prince says to the little shepherd- ess (4:6): \"Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.\" Even if it was written later, the song speaks of the time of Solo- mon. Lebanah (frankincense) near Beth-el (Judges 21:19) was prob- ably the place where the incense plant grew. In the time of Thutmose III the rare plants of the Palestinian gardens were transferred to Egypt, as he himself told and pictured. Thereafter, in the days of Isaiah (60:6) and Jeremiah (6:20), incense was imported into Palestine from southern Arabia. It is appropriate here to explain the name \"Retenu\" or \"Rezenu\" often employed in the Egyptian inscriptions of the New Kingdom to designate Palestine. Galilee is called \"Upper Rezenu.\" \"Rezenu\" is apparently a transcription of the name used by the population of Palestine for their land. The Hebrew language must be questioned on its meaning. In the Scriptures Palestine is frequently called \"Erez\" ( country ), \"Erez Israel\" (the land of Israel), and \"Arzenu\" (possessive case, \"our country\"). 7 What the Egyptologists read as Retenu or Rezenu is probably the \"Arzenu\" of the Bible. In only one inscription of the Middle Kingdom (Twelfth Dy- nasty) under Sesostris III is the name Rezenu mentioned it is a very short account of a raid into that country against M-n-tyw. As we shall find the same name, Mntyw, in Egyptian documents of a much later period, that of King Menashe (Manasseh), the Mntyw of the Middle Kingdom must mean the tribe Menashe. If the in- scription is correctly attributed to the time of Sesostris III, the men- tion of the tribe Menashe would imply that before the Israelites had come to stay in Egypt they had dwelt in Palestine, not as a single patriarchal family, but as tribes strong enough to be regarded as enemies by the pharaoh. This would accord with the tradition of a defeat inflicted by Abraham and the servants of his household on 'Joshua 9:11; Judges 16:24; Psalms 85:10, 13; Micah 5:4; The Song of Sol- omon 2:12; compare also Leviticus 26:5; Numbers 10:9; and Jeremiah 5:19."},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"174 AGES IN CHAOS the kings of Shinar and Elam and their allies (Genesis 14), and with the number of the Israelites (about two million, including women and children) in the days of the Exodus, after some two hundred years of sojourning in Egypt.

Shishak, the pharaoh who carried away the vessels from the Temple at Jerusa- lem, was sought in the period that followed by some hundred years the epoch of the Ramessides. The Ramessides were the last great pharaohs of the imperial era in Egypt.

These cities are represented by figures like the city-figures of Thutmose's bas-relief, and it is obvious that Sosenk copied that mural. But whereas Thutmose's list consists of well-known names familiar from the Scriptures, Sosenk's list contains mostly unknown names. The ac- companying inscription consists \"of stereotyped phrases . . . too vague, general and indecisive to furnish any solid basis for a study of Sosenk's campaign.

Summary The generation that followed Queen Hatshepsut in Egypt was synchronized in this chapter with the generation that followed King Solomon in Palestine. In Egypt it was the time of the pharaoh Icaown to us from modern history books as Thutmose III; in Pales- tine it was the time of Rehoboam, son of Solomon, and Jeroboam of the northern kingdom. The two countries, Egypt and Palestine, came into close contact. The pharaoh invaded Judea and, according to the Egyptian and scriptural narratives alike, \"took all the cities'* and approached the capital, called Kadesh in the annals of the pharaoh and in the Scriptures called both Jerusalem and Kadesh. The conquest of Palestine is described almost identically in the Book of Kings and Chronicles and in the Egyptian annals. The country \"fell into disagreement\"; after an unsuccessful attempt to defend the land, the fortresses and other towns submitted; princes and their households gathered in the capital. By consent of the king and the princes the capital was thrown open and they \"humbled themselves.'* The palace and the Temple of the capital were sacked and the vessels and furniture carried to Egypt. The detailed descrip- tion of these furnishings and utensils, as preserved in the Books of Kings arid Chronicles, agrees perfectly with the pictures engraved on the walls of the Karnak temple. The objects are of identical form and shape, of the same workmanship, of tibe same number: altars, lavers, tables, candlesticks, fountains, vases with rims of \"buds and flowers,'* and cups of lotus shape, and vases of semiprecious stone,"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLE IN JERUSALEM 177 and priestly ephods, gold shields, and doors overlaid with copper.

Among the cities captured by Thutmose III were cities built by Solomon and Rehoboam, 'which were not found in the complete list of Canaan in the time of Joshua's conquest; however, according to the conventional chronology, Thutmose III preceded Joshua. The biblical references to golden chariots in the days of Solomon are demonstrated to be true. Such chariots were brought by the pharaoh from Palestine. Also craftsmen from Palestine were em- ployed in Egypt. Judea became a dependency and its people vassals to the phar- aoh. On his repeated expeditions to collect tribute the pharaoh took back with him frankincense, a product of the land. This, by the way, shows that the frankincense brought by Hatshepsut from the Divine Land was a Palestinean product; and the pharaoh actually refers to the products of Punt and of the Divine Land in connection with his expedition to Palestine. He also transferred to Egypt the zoological and botanical collections of King Solomon. Jeroboam, while in Egypt as a refugee from Solomon, married a queen's sister by the name of Ano.

It had its renaissance in the Late Minoan I period, which cor- responds in 'time to the Egyptian renaissance after the expulsion of the Hyksos. At Mycenae on the Greek mainland also were unearthed a few Egyptian objects bearing the cartouches of Amenhotep II, Amen- hotep III, and his wife Tiy, of the Eighteenth Dynasty (New King- dom); vases of the Late Mycenaean style were dug up in large numbers in Egypt, in Thebes, and especially from under the ruined walls of Akhnaton's palace at el-Amarna, \"which thus gives a fixed date (about 1380 B.C.) for this style of vase-painting.\" 9 The present research endeavors to bring to light a mistake of more than half a millennium in the conventional Egyptian chron- ology of the New Kingdom.

Sepulcliral Chambers The question which now arises is: Are there not other finds be- sides the ceramics which support or challenge the generally ac- cepted view that the upper layer of the Ras Shamra excavations be- longs to the period from the fifteenth to the fourteenth centuries? Does the testimony of architecture and of written documents sup- port the conventional chronology or do they strengthen the view maintained here that this stratum and the past it buried are of the period from the tenth to the ninth or eighth centuries? The chambers of the necropolis, unlike the buildings of the acropolis., are preserved intact. In a typical tomb well-arranged stone steps lead to a sepulchral chamber with arched ceiling. Similar vaults have been found in Cyprus. The excavator of Ras Shamra wrote of them: \"Those in Cyprus are considerably later and con- tinue down to the eighth and seventh centuries, according to the Swedish excavators. 1 One might therefore consider these Cypriote tombs to be late copies of the chamber tombs at Ras Shamra. One fine example is the burial vault of Trachonas on the east coast of the Karpas peninsula, exactly facing Ras Shamra. However, until earlier tombs of this type have been found in Cyprus, direct affilia- tion cannot be claimed. Some five hundred years lie between the Trachonas tomb and those of Ras Shamra.\" 2 The vaults on Cyprus across the strait and in Ras Shamra are of identical construction; they must have been built in the same age. The distortion of chronology makes it necessary to maintain that five hundred years elapsed before the Cypriotes started copying the Ras Shamra vaults, which by then would have been covered with earth and concealed from the human eye.

It is an aperture with a pipe in it through which fluid food was delivered to the dead to sustain the soul on its journey to the other world. It is obviously a very forced explanation to say that the population of Cyprus allowed half a millennium to elapse before they began to copy the tombs of the necropolis of Has Shamra (Minet el Beida). Indeed, this explanation is utterly untenable, not only because of much archaeological material demonstrating that the influence came from Cyprus to the mainland and not the other way round, but especially because of the pottery found in the graves. The following statement was published after the first year of excavation at Has Shamra: \"The influence which appears to dominate, if not at Ras Shamra itself, then, at least, at the near-by necropolis of Minet el Beida, is that of the island of Cyprus.

Other scholars, however, re- jected this equation of the name of the king Nikmed (who also wrote his name Nikmes and Nikmedes) with Nikomed (Nikomedes) of the Greeks, asking how an Ionian name could have been in use in the fourteenth century before this era.

Bible Criticism and the Documents of Ras Shamra For the past seventy years the doctrines of Bible criticism have been taught from most cathedras of modern exegesis and are at last being preached from many pulpits. Two of the fundamental con- cepts have been: (1) before the time of the Kings (or before 1000) there were no written documents among the Israelites, and (2) most passages of the Scriptures are of a later origin than the Scriptures themselves suggest or rabbinical tradition ascribes to them. Since 1930 when the tablets of Ras Shamra were deciphered, they have been regarded as proofs (1) that already in the fifteenth cen- tury Hebrew was written in a highly perfected alphabetic script that had a long period of development behind it, and (2) that many biblical traditions and legends were alive, and biblical style, poetic form, and ways of expression were in use some six hundred years before the biblical books were composed, even according to rabbini- cal tradition. The confusion became great. 1 For three generations famous scholars, to whose lectures students traveled from afar, writers for encyclopedias, and authors of commentaries, all were moved to decrease the age of the Old Testament and even to assume a post- evangelical editing of various parts of the Old Testament.

Now, in the Ras Shamra tablets of the fifteenth or fourteenth century, the same expressions were found. A verdict of later origin had been given on many portions of the prophets: many passages were supposed to have been composed and inter- polated during the Hellenistic period, which followed the conquest of Palestine by Alexander the Great in 332, and many sentences were supposed to have borne allusions to the events of the Macca- bean war against the Seleucides, almost six hundred years after Isaiah.

By advancing the date of formulation of many social, moral, and religious imperatives of the Old Testament to the post-exilic period, Bible criticism had them originate in the Babylonian exile, referring some to the Seleucid period and to the influence of Greek thought. The new view, predominant since the excavations at Ras Shamra, also regards many social, religious, and cultural elements of the Scriptures as copies, but of Canaanitic originals; 1 since they were already in existence some six hundred years before the time the Bible claims for them, they could not be of Jewish origin.

In face of the striking parallels between the language, style, poetical forms, technical expressions, moral ideas, religious thought, temple ordi- nances, social institutions, treasury of legends and traditions, medi- cal knowledge, apparel, and jewelry as reflected in the Ras Shamra tablets and in the pages of the Scriptures, the logical conclusion would have been that the tablets and the Books of the Scriptures containing these parallels are of the same age. But such a deduction was not thought of, owing to the obstacles of chronology already explained. The revision of chronology requires the leveling of the time of Ras Shamra (Level I from the surface) to the time of the kings of Judea until Jehoshaphat. The presence of parallels in the life of Palestine and of a contemporary Syrian town, where the languages of neighboring peoples were learned, appears to be only natural.

Before the excavations of Ras Shamra, frequent mention of Thr\" had already been encountered in various archaeological documents. Akkadian texts speak of \"Khurri,\" and in Egyptian documents a part of Syria is often called \"Kharu.\" It had long been held that these Assyrian and Egyptian designa- tions referred to the Horites or troglodytes of the early chapters of the Scriptures. 1 With the discovery of the Tell el-Amarna archives in Egypt it was found that one of the letters of the archives was written, apart from the introduction, in an unknown tongue. This letter, written by Tushratta, king of Mitanni, dealt in its six hundred lines with some matters interpreted with the help of other letters, and the language was deciphered. At first it was called Mitannian, but later changed to Subarean. Then in the state archives of Boghazkeui in eastern Anatolia let- ters were found in a similar tongue, and its name was given as Khri. The people who spoke this language were called Khr. Scholars read the word differently Khar and Khur but finally they decided on Khur as the acceptable name, and accordingly the people are called Hurrians or Hunites. Despite the fact that the language of this people was found to have been put into writing, the identification of the Hurrians with the biblical Horites or troglodytes was maintained by a number of scholars. 2 A definite vestige of the association of the Hurrians with Palestine has been discovered: on tablets from Tell Taannek, in the valley of Jezreel, Human names were found. ^Imstead, History of Palestine and Syria, p. 140: <c Kharu is doubtless to be connected in name with the Horites, who in Biblical times were remembered only as having been exterminated by the Edomites; it is also possible that there is some connection with the Hurrians.\" a See E.

Those who spoke it were not Semitic, but neither were they Indo- Iranian. 6 Then the writings in alphabetic Khar of Ras Shamra came to light Translations from other languages into Khar proved that at least a part of the population used Khar as their daily speech. Who, then, were these Khar that impressed their name on Syria, their tongue on Asia Minor and on Mitanni, occupied a fortress in Pales- tine, were everywhere and nowhere in particular, were neither Semitic nor Indo-Iranian? It became apparent not only that Khar was expressible in writing, but that the scribes who wrote in Khar were versed in a number of other languages as well, and wore themselves out in lexicographic study (\"several rooms\" in the library of Nikmed \"contained only dic- tionaries and lexicons\" 7 ).

In Egyp- tian the Mediterranean Sea was called the Sea of Khar(u). Was it the sea of troglodytes or the sea of the Carians? The Carians lived on the shore of the eastern Mediterranean and had settlements in many other parts of the world. They have left their traces in geographical names containing the syllable \"car\" or *cart** or \"keret.\" 8 In very early times that of the semilegendary King Minos of Crete they manned his fleet. Herodotus says that at this time they were islanders and served as crews on the ships of Minos. \"Minos had subdued much territory to himself and was vic- torious in war/* and \"this made the Carians too at that time to be very far the most regarded of all nations.\" \"Then a long time afterwards, the Carians were driven from the islands by Dorians and lonians and so came to the mainland*\" 10 The mainland meant here is the southwestern corner of Asia Minor, where Halicarnassus, the native town of Herodotus, was situated. Thucydides ascribed to King Minos the expulsion of the Carians: \"Minos is the earliest of all those known to us by tradition who acquired a navy. . . , [He] became lord of the Cyclades islands and first colonizer of most of them, driving out the Carians and establishing his own sons in them as governors.\" 11 The Carians are described by Thucydides as dispersed on many islands and engaging with the Phoenicians in piracy: \"still more addicted to piracy were the islanders. These included Carians as well as Phoenicians, for Carians inhabited most of the islands.* 7 The close relations existing between the Carians and the Phoenicians are further attested to by the names of towns like Phoinix and Phoinikus in Caria. 12 Knowledge of the whereabouts of Carian colonies outside south- 8 The south of Canaan, called in the Book of Joshua Negeb-Kereti, was, ac- cording to the opinion of various 'scholars, at an early age occupied by immi- grants from Crete. 9 Herodotus (trans.

Herodotus (V, 111) mentions a Carian shield-bearer on Cyprus in the early Persian days. It does not require much ingenuity to come to the conclusion that the Khar of Has Shamra were Carians. The Carians settled not only in Cyprus but also on the shore of the mainland opposite, and similar graves in eastern Cyprus and in Ras Shamra are evidence of this. The peculiarity of the Carian graves was stressed by the early historian Thucydides, who wrote that Carians had inhabited most of the islands \"as may be inferred from the fact that, when Debs was purified by the Athenians in this war [ 426] and the graves of all who had ever died on the island were removed, over half were discovered to be Carians, being recog- nized by the fashion of the armour found buried with them, and by the mode of burial, which is that still in use among them/* 15 Modern archaeologists again point out the peculiar features of the graves of Ras Shamra and of eastern Cyprus. Inasmuch as the Carians were inhabitants of northern Syria early in the first millennium before this era, it is only reasonable to look for a mention of them in the Scriptures.

In one place in the Scriptures (II Samuel 20:23) it is said that Benaiah was in com- mand of Kari (or Kre) and Plett The Philistines, since days of old, have been considered the Kreti-Pleti. The word TPletT is generally regarded as a shortened form of \"Philistines,\" and without sufficient ground they have been presumed to be the same people as the Kreti, and thus originated the theory that the Philistines came from Crete. 17 Pleti cannot be identical with Kreti or Kari, because when- ever they are mentioned the two names are always connected by \"and.\" 18 The origin of the Kreti in Crete heard even in the name is also attested to by the Version of the Seventy, who translated \"KretT by \"Cretans.\" The Carians came from Crete. The Kreti also came from Crete and were identical with the Kari. It is obvious that Carians and Kari and Kreti were the same. The Carians, royal bodyguard in the Jerusalem of Queen Athaliah, were employed in the same capacity in the Egypt of the seventh century, after they had arrived therte together with the lonians, driven by a gale. 19 The Carians occupied this position until Cam- King James version has \"the Captains and the Guard.** 17 The Philistines came from the island of Caphtor (Deuteronomy 2:23; Amos 9:7; Jeremiah 47:4). Jeremiah speaks of the 'Philistines, the remnants of the country of Caphtor.\" By identifying the Philistines with Kreti and Pleti, Caphtor was identified as Crete. It will be more in accord with historical evidence if we understand Caphtor to be Cyprus. If Caphtor was not Cyprus, then no name for Cyprus and no mention of the island would be found in the Scriptures, and that would be unlikely because Cyprus is very close to Syria. The islands of Khitiim (Jeremiah 2:10; Ezekiel 27:6), usually identified as Cyprus, signified all the islands and coastlands of the west, Macedonia, and even Italy.

In this connection it is interesting to correlate Herodotus' state- ment (I, 171ff.) that the Carians invented and produced arms and were imitated by the Greeks with the fact that \"in no other site in Syria or Palestine was found such a large quantity of arms as in Has Shamra\" 21 and with the Targum's translation of Kreti as bow- men.

The Carian Language With the Ras Shamra tablets before the linguists, it would seem that the scholarly world is at last closer to the solution of the ques- tion, What was the language of the Carians? than was Strabo, who discussed it nineteen centuries ago. 1 Homer, in his enumeration of the allies of Troy, included \"the barbarously speaking Carians.'* Apollodorus understood these words as an allusion to the fact that the Carians spoke, not Greek, but some strange language. 2 Strabo concluded from Homers reference that the Carians spoke Greek but pronounced it like barbarians. Strabo probably had in mind the Carians of Asia Minor, about whom Herodotus wrote that, with the settlement of the Carians there, the speech of the Caunians, the previous inhabitants, lias grown like to the Carians*, or the Carians* to theirs.\" 8 That the Carians used a speech not understandable to the Greeks \"Ibid., H, 154. a Dussaud, Les D6couvertes, p. 20.

The Carians used Greek too; Herodotus tells us that the Egyptians learned Greek from the Carians and lonians who came to Egypt in the days of Psammetich in the seventh century. A scattering of Carian words is found in the classic authors; also a few Carian personal names are preserved. 5 In Egypt, on various monuments, together with Greek autographs were found autographs not in Greek; they were written in Greek letters with the addition of a number of different characters so as to conform to the phonetics of the tongue. The conclusion was drawn that these were the names Carian mercenaries signed next to those of their Ionian comrades-in- arms. 6 The time was the seventh century. A number of epitaphs, some bilingual in Carian and in Egyptian were also discovered, but as the texts were apparently not exact translations from one language into the other, attempts to decipher the Carian have re- mained quite indecisive. The hypothesis that the language was Indo- German was disputed and rejected. 7 Neither is it Semitic. The same diagnosis that it is neither Indo-German nor Semitic is made for the Human (Khar) language of Mesopotamia.

For reasons explained previously, it seems to me that it would be profitable to investigate the Khar of Ras Shamra, proceeding on the basis that it is the Carian language but in other characters, and to decipher Carian inscriptions with the help of the tablets of Ras Shamra. The theory that the Ras Shamra tablets contain references to lonians should not have been rejected; lonians might have been mentioned in them, for it was not the fourteenth but the ninth cen- tury. It seems to me also permissible to conjecture that the word read as Ugarit 9 is the Carian-Ionian name of Euagoras, Kings of that name ruled on Cyprus, and the reign of one Euagoras in the fifth century before this era and of another early in the fourth cen- tury are known from Greek and Latin authors. The war of the sec- ond Euagoras against the Persians is mentioned in a later chapter of the present work. The influence of Cyprus on Ras Shamra was emphasized by the excavators; it is thought that in an early period this site on the Syrian shore might have been a colony of Cyprian rulers. This observation corroborates the surmise that an early long of Cyprus, a descendant of Carians who were driven to the east by the lonians, built a city on the Syrian shore opposite the island of Cyprus on the ruins of a previous city and called it by his own name, Euagoras. The name of the king Nikmedes (also written Nikmes, Nikmed) is the lonian-Carian name Nikomedes. A similar name, Nikodamos, may have been a form more agreeable to a Semitic ear. 10 The city of Didyma, whence came the lonians to Ugarit, was in Ionia, but its name is Carian. 11 Tablets of the ninth century before the present era could contain this name, but not tablets of the fifteenth century.

Despite the fact that at an early date the Carians were driven from Crete and the Cyclades by the Greeks (lonians), the two people intermingled, and the story of their first appearance together on the Egyptian shore shows that they became partners in their enterprises. In the classic literature the Carians usually appear either with the lonians or with the Phoenicians. If one day an Orphic hymn should be found in the dust of Ras Shamra it would be a lucky day for the excavators but no miracle. According to Homer, the Carians participated in the defense of Troy. They might have had their own reminiscences and their own poems in which they sang the battles of Ilion. It is known that on Cyprus poems were composed dealing with the same subject as the Iliad, 13 but, except for twenty-five short fragments, nothing remains of them. Were these poems orginally written in Carian?

In the veins of the Theban Dynasty there was Ethiopian blood. 12 Was the royal wife of Thutmose III a full-blooded Ethiopian and did she bear him a dark-skinned son? Or was Amenhotep II not the son of Thutmose III at all? He called himself son of Thutmose, but this claim need not have been literally true. He called his mother Hatshepsut. 18 Is it possible that before ascending the throne of Egypt he was a viceroy in Ethiopia? 14 Conventional chronology identifying Zerah. with Osorkon of the Libyan Dynasty encounters difficulty in the biblical reference to Zerah as an Ethiopian.

Egypt, at the very zenith of its imperial might, was beaten by Asa, king of Judah, and this was not a victory over an Egyptian garrison or a detachment dispatched to collect tribute, but over the multitude of the Egyptian-Ethiopian and Libyan hosts, at the head of whom stood the emperor-pharaoh himself. With the rout of the Egyptian army in the south of Palestine, all of Syria-Palestine naturally was freed of the Egyptian yoke. The pharaoh had previously laid Ugarit waste and threatened all the kingdoms in this area; it is conceivable that the king of Judah had some help from the north, and the sympathy of the Syrian maritime peoples must certainly have been with Asa. The inscriptions of Amenhotep II reveal his ambition to dominate, in addition to the land of the Nile, the lands of the Jordan, Orontes, and Euphrates, which had rebelled after the death of Thutmose III. The great victory at Mareshah carried a message of freedom to all these peo- ples; the repercussions of the battle should have been heard in many countries and for many generations. But only once again does the Book of Chronicles pay tribute to this victory, and this in the words of the seer Hanani: \"Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubim [Libyans] a huge host, with very many chariots and horsemen?\" (II Chronicles 16:8.) It is also said that the population of the north- ern tribes went over to Judah because of the high esteem thf? country enjoyed after it had successfully repelled the pharaoh and his army (II Chronicles 15:9). Is no more material concerning the victory of Asa over Amenhotep II preserved? Such a great triumph should have had a greater echo. It had this echo. A Phoenician poem sings of that victory over the host of Amenhotep II. The Poem of Keret Among the epics unearthed at Ras Shamra, one contains some historical material. The poem of Keret the archaeologists call it by the name of its hero has a historical setting. It was first translated"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"212 AGES IN CHAOS and interpreted by Charles Virolleaud. 1 Later a very different mean- ing was given to the text. Virolleaud read in the text of the danger threatening the country of Keret, king of Sidon. The invasion of Negeb (south of Palestine) by the army of Terah aroused Keret's fears; he wept in the seclusion of his chamber. In his great distress he was encouraged by a voice heard in a dream, and he went to meet the danger and joined the army of the defenders. The names of Asher and Zebulun, two tribes, appear according to Virolleaud, in the poem. It is not clear from the poem whether the role of the tribe of Zebulun was that of an enemy or a friend. Asher is mentioned repeatedly in a refrain, and the poem gives a vivid feeling of armed tribesmen hurrying to join the main army opposing Terah. Asher, two and two are gone, Asher, three and three are gone, shut the houses, marched together. Volunteers joined the thousands of Hasis. Men of Hasis went by thousands, and by myriads, as a flood [i/r]. They marched to meet the army of Terah. And Terah came into Negeb with a great force: \"a great force of three hundred times ten thousand [rbt]\" which would mean if the translation is correct- three million men. Then the poem tells that the huge invading army, having been defeated, was in full retreat. Who was Terah? asked Virolleaud. In Genesis the father of Abra- ham is called Terah. The theory was advanced 2 and found fol- lowers in France that patriarchal migrations and wars are described in the Phoenician poem of Keret. It was found to be a very illu- minating addition to the legends about the sojourn and wandering of the patriarchs in Negeb southern Palestine as found in Genesis. The patriarch Abraham came to Negeb; so did Terah of the poem. In the Scriptures it is said that Terah, Abraham's father, migrated from Ur of the Chaldees on the lower flow of the Euphrates to Harran in the northwest, and ended his days there (Genesis 11:32). Charles Virolleaud, La L6gende de Keret, roi des Sidoniens (Paris, 1936). *'C ermine nous Taoons iwtique dejd (Syria, Revue tfart oriental et d'arcteol- ogie, XIV, 149), ce nom de Trh est e'videmment la merne que celui du pere ^Abraham\" Ibid., p. 25."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"RAS SHAMRA 213 A correction was introduced with the help of the poem, and it was agreed that Terah did not die in Harran but prepared the conquest of Canaan from the south and also accomplished it in part, and that Abraham capitulated when he met difficulties and left Canaan to seek refuge in Egypt. 3 Abraham and his two brothers, sons of the scriptural Terah, are not mentioned in the poem, and it was con- jectured that this was because of the leading role played by Terah and the inconspicuous role of Abraham, the latter becoming an anonym in the multitude of the Terahites, And if tie tale is very different from the scriptural legend, still the combination Negeb, the scene, and Terah, the invader seemed to be a convincing parallel to Negeb, the scene, and Abraham, son of Terah, the in- vader. Consequently, the conclusion was drawn by Virolleaud that Terahites invaded the south of Canaan, meeting resistance on the part of the population, although in the Scriptures nothing is said about Abraham's war with the Canaanit.es, and in fact the peace- fulness of his sojourn there is stressed. An unexplained unconformity is the huge number of soldiers in the host of Terah: three hundred times ten thousand is very differ- ent from the number of persons in Abraham's household, servants included. The occurrence of the names Asher and Zebulun also pre- sented a difficulty. Asher and Zebulun were sons of Israel of the Scriptures; these tribes were descendants of Abraham, son of Terah. How could Terah have battled with children of Asher and Zebulun, his descendants of many generations? To meet this situation it was said that originally the names of Asher and Zebulun belonged to cantons inhabited by Canaanites. At a later date these places were conquered by the tribes of Israel, who did not give their names to, but received their names from, the cantons. 4 Another translation and interpretation of the poem of Keret was 9<f Pouf les Helyreux, Terah n'avait fait que pr&parer la conquete ou Toccupa- tion de Canaan, et son fils Abram n'avait fait luwneme qu'6baucher Pentreprise, puisque, devant les difficult^, il avait du abandonner la partie et setait refugte en Egypte.\" Ibid., p. 32. *\"IZ ne s'agit pas id de deux des douze tribes (Asher et Zebulun), mate de deux de ces cantons canacm6ens> dont les douze tribes prendront, un jour, le nom\" Ibid., p. 18."},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"214 AGES IN CHAOS presented. It rejects Terah, Asher, Zebulun, as proper names, find- ing for them the meanings: bridegroom (terah), after, behind (atur), sick man (zebulun)* It also denies the predominant martial theme of the poem, regarding it as a love romance. Thus are ex- plained away the names of tribes not to be expected in Ugaritic times. Numerous other changes and corrections were offered. It seems to us, however, that Virolleaud's translation was not far from the truth. Terah of the poem was, indeed, not the father of the patriarch, but the names of the tribes and the martial plot appear to be consistent with history. It is, in fact, undisputed that Ugarit and the entire Phoenician coast were threatened by Amenhotep II in the period with which we are concerned. Free from the limitations imposed by an incorrect estimate of the age of tie Ras Shamra tablets, we pose this question: Is an unsuc- cessful invasion of southern Palestine by a large host known to us from the Scriptures? Such an invasion occurred in the days of Asa, king of Judah, and it was headed by Zerah the Ethiopian. In the Second Book of Chronicles the invading army under Zerah is called a very large multitude, \"thousand thousand,\" or a million. n CHRONICLES 14:9 And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with a host of a thousand thousand. . . . We have already recognized Zerah the Ethiopian as King Amen- hotep II, and compared the scriptural and the Egyptian material. We shall compare a few data from the Phoenician poem and from tie inscriptions of Amenhotep II and from the Scriptures. If we again find parallels, obviously we shall strengthen the identifica- tion of Zerah as Amenhotep II. In the Phoenician poem the army of Terah is described in these words: A great force of 300 times 10,000 [rbf] with harpes [hepes] of copper, with daggers [snn] of bronze. B H. L.

In the tomb of Amenken, 7 King Arnenhotep II is portrayed in- specting gifts to be distributed among his officers; these are swords described with the words \"360 bronze hps [hepes]\" and next to these swords are pictured one hundred and forty daggers. Inasmuch as the Egyptian name is given to the weapons in the Phoenician poem, their Egyptian origin would not be an arbitrary conclusion. The weapons are designated in the Phoenician poem by the word used on the Egyptian monument depicting Pharaoh Arnenhotep II with weapons for his army. Accordingly, the forces of Terah were armed with weapons identical with those with which Arnenhotep armed his soldiers. Examples of harpes (scimitars) have been found in Gezer in southern Palestine. 8 The extant fragments of the poem describe the armies rushing to the battle. We see Keret marching across fields on which he finds arms thrown away by the fleeing soldiers of a beaten army; he comes to a spring tinged with blood. 9 He marches toward the cities of Edom with the intention of sharing in the loot. According to the Scriptures, after the battle of Mareshah ( More- sheth-gath) the Judean victors looted the cities of the south: *. . , the people . . pursued them unto Gerar. . . . And they smote all the cities round about Gerar . . . and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceedingly much spoil in them\" (II Chronicles 14:13-14).

But we are more anxious to know who were the \"Sapasites\" before the walls of the cities of Edom, and what the name Serirot designates, and whether we are on the road we set ourselves to follow. What does \"people of Sapas\" mean? A partial answer is at hand; \"Sapas is the sun and the Sapasites got their name from it; Sapas of Canaan was analogous to Shamash [sun] of the Assyrians and Babylonians.\" 11 The people who are repeatedly named as opposing Keret before the walls of the Edomite city were Sapas or Shamash men. Cities in Edom were doomed to be looted, according to the poem and the Second Book of Chronicles, which also suggested that this fate was imposed on them because they apparently supported Zerah and his Ethiopian and Libyan host.

His majesty fur- nished an example of bravery there. The city of Shamash Edom is nowhere mentioned in extant Egyp- tian documents except in the registers of Thutmose III and in this monumental inscription of Amenhotep II. Is it a coincidence that, in the Phoenician poem about the invasion of Terah and his multi- tude, the name of the city is Edom and the people are called Sapas or Shamash? We have identified Terah of the poem as Zerah of the Scriptures. We have identified Zerah of the Scriptures as Amenhotep II. Now we find the same city with the same people as the military base of Terah of the poem and of Amenhotep II of the hieroglyphic annals, Of the word \"Sarira\" or \"Serirot\" (plural) in the poem of Keret we have an explanation in the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Scriptures. An addition to I Kings 12:24 gives some details con- cerning Jeroboam. His mother, called Zeruah in I Kings 11:26, is re- ferred to there as Sarira. When he was appointed by Solomon to be over the northern part of the kingdom he built a town in Mount Ephraim and named it Sarira. When, after tibe death of Solomon, Jeroboam returned from his exile in Egypt he \"came into the land of Sarira.\" The tribe of Ephraim assembled there and, according to the Septuagint, Jeroboam fortified Sarira. Sarira was the name of a fortress built first about -920 and possi- bly of every fortress built following the plan of Jeroboam's fortress, which he called by the name of his mother. In the days of Keret, one generation later, the name Edom-Serirot (plural of Sarira) is used. Half a millennium before Jeroboam, Serirot is an anachronism. What was the role of Keret in the allied army? In II Samuel 8:18 it is written that Kreti and Pleti (Cherethites and Pelethites) were bodyguards of David. These were mercenaries in the service of the king of Jerusalem.

Analysis of the historical background of the Keret poem reveals that Virolleaud's translation was rejected without sufficient reason. It is a description of a war and a rout. The mention of the tribes of Asher and Zebulun in this setting is natural and does not call for a philological theory that gives other meanings to these names. These two tribes of the tribes of Israel were the closest neighbors of Sidon. Together with the Sidonians they left their homes and hastened to Mareshah to take part in the battle or to exploit Asa's victory. An allusion to this co-operation of the northern tribes is found in the Second Book of Chronicles (15:9) following the description of Asa's victory: \"they fell to him [Asa] out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the Lord his God was with him.\" Comparing the record of the Second Book of Chronicles and the annals of Amenhotep II, who followed Thutmose III, we found that according to both sources a great army came from the borders of Egypt and invaded Palestine; that it reached the place Moresheth- Gath or Mu Areset, in Egyptian, one or two days* distance from the border (nakhd mizraim); and that it was turned back by defenders of the land. And that the domination of Egypt over Palestine ceased and was re-established only by the successor of Amenhotep II. Comparing the annals of Amenhotep II with the poem of Keret, we find in both sources that the Phoenician coast was threatened (Ugarit is especially mentioned by Amenhotep II) ; that the invaders were armed with hepes, or copper scimitars; and that Shamash Edom played an important role in the campaign, being occupied first by Amenhotep II, then by Keret and his allies, who defeated the invader.

Northern tribes of Israel joined the army of the south in looting the cities of Negeb. We would not attempt to derive an argument for the present re- construction of history and to build our conclusions on Virolleaud's interpretation of the Keret poem, since this translation is a matter of controversy. On the other hand, we may offer a partial vindication of Virolleaud, and we find support for him in the historical setting as revealed by our reconstruction. Some twenty years after the defeat at Mareshah, Thutmose IV, successor to Amenhotep II, re-established Egyptian hegemony over Syria and Palestine. There are no records of the campaign, but he bears the appellation \"conqueror of Syria.\" 12 Thutmose IV met very little resistance, if any. The pressure of the Assyrians from the north made it desirable for the Syrians to submit to Egypt. 13 The End of Ugarit The excavator of Ras Shamra found that the city had been de- stroyed by violence and had not been rebuilt.

Judged by these findings, Ugarit came to its end in the later days of Amenhotep III or in the early days of Akhnaton, a time known as the el-Amarna period. In a letter written by Abimilki, king of Tyre, and found in the state archives of Akhet-Aton (el-Amarna), this vassal king informed the pharaoh of what had happened to Ugarit: And fire has consumed Ugarit, the city of the king; half of it is consumed, and its other half is not; and the people of the army of Hatti are not there. 1 Half of Ugarit was burned, the other half was razed, and the in- vaders, soldiers of Hatti, retreated after they had wrought this destruction. Mention of the destruction brought upon Ugarit and actual evidence of demolition by a violent hand convinced the investigators of Ras Shamra that the city ceased to exist in the very days to which the letter of Abimilki referred.

Ruins of temples, palaces, tombs, private dwellings, and workshops of craftsmen have been cleared of the desert sand that buried them for thousands of years.

Letters written by the pharaohs or in their names were obviously copies stored in the archives in order to preserve a record. The language of the tablets, with few excep- tions, is Assyro-Babylonian (Akkadian), with many words in a Syrian dialect similar to Hebrew. 1 The city of Akhet-Aton was built by the schismatic king Amenho- tep IV, who abolished the cult of Amon of Thebes and introduced the cult of Aton, interpreted as the solax disk, and who changed his name to Akhnaton. But shortly after his reign the capital city of Akhet-Aton was abandoned, his religion was stamped as heresy, and his images were mutilated. His son-in-law, the young pharaoh Tutankhamen, reigned briefly in the old capital, Thebes. Then the dynasty became extinct. Akhet-Aton had a short history of only about twenty-five years before it was deserted by its inhabitants. The time of the letters can be established with some precision. They were addressed to Nimmuria (Ni-ib-mu'-wa-ri-ia, Mi-im-mu- ri-ia, Im-mu-ri-ia) ? who was Amenhotep III, and to Naphuria (Na- ap-hu-ru-ri-ia, Nam-hur-ia), who was Amenhotep IV (Akhnaton). The letters sent to Amenhotep III were presumably brought to Akhet-Aton from the archives at Thebes.

One of the main ob- jects of investigation was to identify places and peoples named in the letters. In the tablets written by the vassal king of Jerusalem (Urusalim) to the pharaoh, repeated mention is made of the \"Habiru,\" who threatened the land from east of the Jordan. In letters written from other places, there is no reference to Habiru, but an invasion of sa-gaz-mesh (sa-gaz is also read ideographically habatu and trans- lated \"cutthroats,\" \"pillagers\") is mentioned over and over again. With the help of various letters it has been established that Habiru and sa-gaz (habatu) were identical. In letters from Syria the ap- proach of the king of Hatti to the slopes of the mountains of Lebanon was reported with terror. The impression received is that these invasions of Habiru from the east and of the king of Hatti from the north menaced Egyptian domination of Syria, a domination which, it was learned, actually ceased shortly after the reign of Akhnaton. In their letters the vassals incessantly ask for help against the invaders and often also against one another. King Akhnaton, \"the first monotheist in world history/' 2 did not care for his empire; he was immersed in his dream of \"a religion of love.\" Little or no help was sent; the mastery of the phar- aohs over Syria and Canaan was broken, and the control of Egypt over her Asiatic tributary provinces was swept away. The name \"king of Hatti\" is generally understood as \"king of the Hittites.\" In a later period that of Seti I and Ramses II of the Nineteenth Dynasty there were great wars between the kings of Hatti and the pharaohs. In a chapter dealing with that period the history of the \"forgotten empire of the Hittites\" will be analyzed. \"The king of Hatti\" of the el-Amarna period is supposed to have been one of the kings of that \"forgotten empire.\" The name Habiru, mentioned in the letters of the king of Jerusa- lem, became an important issue and gave rise to the following con- jecture: these invaders could have been the Hebrews under Joshua drawing near to the borders of Canaan.

Arriving at the Promised Land during the time of Amen- hotep III and Akhnaton, they were supposed to have left Egypt sometime in the days of Thutmose III or Amenhotep II. This does not seem to be a well-founded construction, because these monarchs were conquerors and despots, too strong to allow the Israelites to put off the yoke of bondage. Other scholars We refused to identify the Israelites with the Habiru because the Hebrews were thought still to have been in Egypt at the time of Akhnaton, and the sole opportunity they would have had to leave would have been during a period of anarchy, when the once power- ful dynasty was dying down, or during the interregnum following the extinction of that dynasty: these would have been the only times suitable for the rebellion of the slaves and their departure. In that view the Habiru came in one of the waves of nomads eager to settle in the land of Canaan; other waves must have followed, one of them being the Israelites under Joshua ben Nun. In the introductory chapter of this book I dwelt on the various theories relative to the time of the Exodus. There it was explained that a large group of scholars cannot compromise even on an Exodus at the end of the Eighteenth Dynasty, but have chosen Ramses II of the Nineteenth Dynasty to be the Pharaoh of the Exodus, holding the Exodus to be an insignificant event in the history of Egypt; or they select Ramses to be the Pharaoh of Oppression and his son Merneptah the Pharaoh of the Exodus. As the el-Amarna tablets, in the opinion of these scholars, pre- ceded the Exodus, the Habiru could not possibly have been the Israelites. Another link was sought to connect the narrative of the Scriptures with the details unfolded in the letters. A parallel to Joseph was found in the Egyptian courtier of Semitic name and obviously Semitic origin, Dudu, 8 whose memory is preserved not only as the addressee of a few el-Amarna letters but also as the owner of a rich sepulcher in Akhet-Aton. King Akhnaton, desirous of making a special gift to his favorites, presented each with a tomb built during the lifetime of the recipient and engraved with scenes \"Mercer, The Tett el-Amarna Tablets, pp. 510ff.; Barton, Archaeology and the Bible, p. ,368; H, Ranke, in Zeitschrift fur Aegyptische Sprache, LVI (1920), 69-71.

In the tomb of Dudu there are also figures of Semites rejoicing at Dudu's rewards. A letter written to this Dudu will be quoted later on. Still another resemblance to Joseph was found in the person of lanhama, 4 who, according to the references in the el-Amarna letters, was an Egyptian chief in charge of the granaries of the state, where grain was bought by the Canaanite princes. There was a famine in the land, and it is an unceasing cry for grain that we hear from the letters of the king of Gubla and Sumur (Sumura). One further conjecture may be recorded. The visit of Isaac and Rebecca or of Abraham and Sarah to Egypt 5 was linked to some references to a handmaid of the goddess of the city of Gubla and her husband, who were in Egypt The king of Gubla and Sumur supported the couple in their desire to return to Canaan, if he did not actually ask for their extradition. But the theory identifying the Habiru and the Hebrews was not abandoned; it seemed that otherwise the histories of these two peoples of antiquity, the Egyptians and the Hebrews, who inhabited neighboring countries, would show no connecting link in the course of many hundreds of years of their early history. The other possible link the Merneptah stele, with which I shall deal later was also interpreted both in support of and against the Habiru-Hebrew theory. The equation Habiru-Hebrews is still accepted by a large number of scholars: at the time when the el-Amarna letters were written the Israelite nomads of the desert were knocking at the gates of the land which they had come to conquer. Did this opinion contradict the scheme according to which the Israelites were still in bondage under Ramses II? If so, then the conception had to be formulated anew, and the migration of the Hebrews was then supposed to have pro- *Cf, Marquart, Chtonolozische Untersuckungen, pp. 35ff., and Jeremias, Das Alte Testament im Lichte &s Alten Orients (2nd ect; Leipzig, 1906), pp, 390ff. 5 O.

Reconciling theories were put forth dividing the Exodus into several successive departures, the Rachel clan and the Leah clan leaving at different times; when the former reached Canaan the latter was still being oppressed in Egypt and followed later. Another theory had the Josephites coming from Egypt and the Jacobites directly from Mesopotamia; still another variation had the Jacobites coming from Egypt and the Abrahamites from the north, A further difficulty presented by the equation Habiru-Hebrews arose from the fact that no person in the Book of Joshua could be identified in the el-Amarna letters. When the Israelites entered Canaan, Adonizedek was king of Jerusalem, Hoham king of Hebron, Piram king of Jarmuth, Japhia king of Lachish, and Debir king of Eglon (Joshua 10:3). Among the letters there are a number written by kings of some of these places but not by these kings. Much more important is the fact that there is little similarity in the events described in both sources. The episode of the siege of Jericho, the most remarkable occurrence in the first period of the conquest, is missing in the letters, and Jericho is not mentioned at all. This silence is strange, if the Habiru were the Hebrews under Joshua. No contemporaneous event can be traced in the letters. The pharaohs of the Nineteenth Dynasty, Seti and Ramses II, left memorial monuments in Egypt and in Palestine regarding their passage through Palestine as conquerors of the land lost by the pharaohs of the el-Amarna period or by their successors. In the Books of Joshua and Judges, covering over four hundred years, nothing suggests the hegemony of Egypt or her interference in the affairs of Canaan. For all these reasons it seemed too bold to place the story of the conquest by the Hebrews so far back in time. The discussion is still in progress. Some of those who could not accept the theory that the Hebrews had already entered Canaan at the time of Amenhotep III and Akhnaton identified the Habiru as the Apiru, the workers in the Egyptian quarries on the Sinai Peninsula, on their seasonal journey from there to their homes in Lebanon; others identified them as migrants from the Babylonian district of Afiru.

Or how could they have left their bondage in Egypt before it was weakened? According to my chronological scheme, the letters of el-Amarna, sent and received by Amenhotep III and Akhnaton, were written, not in 1410 to 1370 as is generally accepted, but in 870 to 840, at the time of King Jehoshaphat in Jerusalem. 6 If this theory is correct, among the tablets of the el-Amarna collection we should expect to find letters written by the royal scribes, skilled in cunei- form, in the name of the Israelite kings of Jerusalem and of Samaria. The most prolific writer of letters among die princes and chiefs was the king of Sumur (Samaria). About sixty letters of his are pre- served, fifty-four of them addressed to the king of Egypt. The phar- aoh even wrote to him: \"Thou writest to rne more than all the regents/* The three hundred and sixty letters, linking the political past of the great and small nations of the Near East at an important period of remote antiquity, were objects of prolonged study in the interest of Egyptian, Babylonian, Hittite, Syrian, and Canaanite histories.

Urusalim of the el-Amarna letters could not be misunderstood; there was no difficulty in recognizing it as Jerusalem. The difficulty arose only with respect to the passages in the Scriptures 1 according to which the pre-Israelite city was called Salem or Jebus, and not Jerusalem. It was decided that the el-Amarna letters exposed the error of these statements. If, however, the el-Amarna letters were written in the Israelite period, the above conflict does not exist. Sumur (also Sumura) and Gubla are the most frequently named cities in the el-Amarna letters, each being mentioned more than one hundred times. Other cities are not mentioned even ten or fifteen times. \"No king's or prince's name is given for this city Sumur, next to Gubla the most frequently referred to; despite the distress that came upon her, no letter from there is to be found in the entire el-Amarna correspondence/* 2 It is obvious from the content of the letters that Sumur was the \"most important place** in Syria-Palestine and apparently also the seat of the deputy administering the region. It was a fortress. 8 A king's palace was there, and the frequent mention of this palace in the letters to the pharaoh gives the impression that it was a well- known building. Sumur or Sumura was Samaria (Semer, Somron, in Hebrew). It could not be presumed that Sumur was Samaria because it was in the reign of Omri, father of Ahab, that this city was built, and in the period preceding the conquest of Joshua, of course, it had not existed. i KINGS 16:24 And he [Omri] bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria. a See Genesis 14:18; Joshua 15:8; 18:28; Judges 19:10-11; I Chronicles 11:4-5. \"Weber in Knudtzon, Die El-Amarna-Tafeln, p. 1135. \"Letter 81."},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"THE EL-AMARNA LETTERS 281 Since vowels were a late interpolation in the Hebrew Bible, in- serted by the Masoretes (\"carriers of the tradition\") over a thou- sand years after the Old Testament had been completed, the name Semer can also be read Sumur. Samaria was surrounded by a strong wall, and remnants of it have been unearthed. The city had a magnificent royal palace, and the ruins of it are seen today. The identity of Sumur (Sumura) and Samaria will be shown in detail in the following pages, which describe the history of the period. Together with Sumur, Gubla is named repeatedly. Evidence has been found in the letters that Gubla was considered heir to Sumur when this city was temporarily occupied by the Syrians. The king of Gubla wrote to the pharaoh in Egypt: LETTER 85: What was formerly given in [to] Sumura, should now be given in [to] Gubla. There is scarcely a letter of the king of Gubla in which his un- easiness about Sumur does not find expression. He mentioned the name of Sumur or Sumura about eighty-five times in his letters, be- sides the numerous times that the city is referred to as \"king's city\" or \"my city/* It was assumed that Gubla is Byblos, Kpny in Egyptian, but Gwal in Phoenician and Hebrew/ the Phoenician city north of Beirut.

If Sumur is Samaria, then it is apparent that Gubla is the original name of Jezreel, the other capital in Israel. Omri built Samaria and its palace. Ahab, his son, built his palace in Jezreel, adjacent to the vineyard of Naboth. There Queen Jezebel, the wife of Ahab, later met a violent death. Jezebel (Izebel), in the memory of the people the most hated person of the period of the Kings, was a daughter of the Sidonian king Ethbaal (I Kings 16:31). She brought the evil of the heathen into the land, killed the prophets of Yahwe, and perse- cuted Elijah the Tishbite. Hundreds of prophets of Baal \"eat at Jezebel's table\" (I Kings 18:19).

King Ahab must have had many wives, for he left seventy sons in Samaria (II Kings 10:1). But the daughter of the Sidonian king was Ahab's chief wife. She exercised charm and influence over him, and he built for her the new residence with her active participation, as the story of Naboth. relates. It was not to be expected that Ahab, the apostate, would name the new residence in honor of the persecuted deity, the God of Israel (\"the Lord will sow\"). It is possible that the name of the new residence was derived from the name of the Phoenician city, dear to the Phoenician princess, now queen of Israel.

After that the city was given the name of the valley Jezreel. 12 We shall proceed on the assumption that Sumur and Gubla were Samaria and Jezreel in Israel: the two cities were the two capitals of one state. The King of Gubla was worried about his other capital, alternately lost and recovered in incessant wars with the Syrians. When Sumur fell Gubla became its heir. We thus have the answer to the question of why no king of Sumur is mentioned in the el-Amarna letters, although the city is named so often: its king had his resi- dence in Gubla. Possibly some of the letters which bear the usual blessing, \"May Belit of Gubla give power,\" were written from Sumur (Samaria).

And the king of Jerusalem wrote: LETTER 286: Behold, neither my father nor my mother has put me in this place. The mighty hand of the king has led me into the house of my father. This means that the pharaoh of Egypt was wont to choose from among the royal princes one to succeed his father, the vassal king. Governors were attached to \"the regents,\" the vassal kings, as representatives of the Egyptian crown. One was for northern Syria, with his seat probably at Damascus. Another governor had his seat in Samaria (Sumur). We shall meet both of them not only in the letters but also in the Scriptures, and we shall recognize them there. In Jerusalem there was no permanent deputy. In one of his letters the king of Jerusalem asked that the \"deputy of the king,\" whose seat was in Gaza, be sent to visit Jerusalem. 10 Occasionally a deputy officer did visit Jerusalem. 17 These consular visits by invitation and the absence of a permanent representative of the Egyptian crown suggest that the king of Jerusalem was a vassal with greater inde- pendence than the other kings and chiefs. Although the kings of Jerusalem and Samaria were themselves vassals, they had their own tributaries. The king of Jerusalem re- ceived homage and tribute in silver and cattle from the kings of Arabia and from the Philistines (II Chronicles 17:11). The king of Moab, Mesha, was tributary to Samaria (II Kings 3:4). In the el- Amarna letters we shall often meet \"the rebel Mesh\"; his name is mentioned so frequently that it was thought to be a grammatical form indicating a group. We shall readily see that ameZ-gag-Mesh, in the singular, was \"the rebel Mesh,\" the rebellious king of Moab, and the amelut-gaz-Mesh were \"the people of the rebel Mesh\" or the Moabites.

The similarity or identity of the names is corroborated by the identity of the func- tions of their bearers, as presented in the Scriptures and in the letters. Not only can the personages in Judah, Israel, Moab, and Syria be traced in the Books of Kings and Chronicles and in the letters of el- Amarna; the names of the rulers of the tiny kingdoms in Syria also may be compared in the el-Amarna letters and in the inscriptions of Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, who lived in the time of Jehoshaphat and Ahab. Both sources the el-Arnarna letters and the inscriptions of the Assyrian king are written in the same characters, cuneiform. Later in this discourse on the el-Amarna letters the participants in the war of resistance against the invader from the north will be identified. The Letters of Jehoshaphat's Captains King Jehoshaphat had five captains at the head of his army. n CHRONICLES 17: 14-19 And these are the numbers of them accord- ing [in obeisance] to the house of their fathers: Of Judah, the cap- tains of thousands; Adnah the chief, and with him mighty men of valour three hundred thousand.

We shall find in the next generation the names of the cap- tains Ishmael, the son of Jehohanan, and Elishaphat, the son of Zichri. 1 The number of men under each of the five chiefs might mean that in their feudal districts there were one, two, or three hundred thousand men fit for conscription; however, another ex- planation is possible, and it is presented in one of the following sec- tions. The el-Amarna letters offer rich material on the feudal system in Judah at that time. We identify letters written by three of the five military chiefs of Jehoshaphat. Their position as military chiefs is the same in the letters as in the Book of Chronicles; their names are easily recog- nizable. A slight variation in one of the names has a connotation that will lead us to reflection on the development of religion in Judah and on the reform that took place shortly after the death of Jehoshaphat. Addudani (also spelled Addadani) of the el-Amarna letters is called in the Scriptures Adna. 2 But the inscription of Shamshi- Ramman, who became the Assyrian king after Shalmaneser in 825, contains a reference to a gift he received from Ada-danu, prince of Gaza (Azati). 8 The \"son of Zuchru\" of the el-Amarna letters is called the \"son of Zichri\" in the Bible. 4 lahzibada of the el-Amarna letters is lehozabad (Jehozabad) in the Scriptures. These officers were really important chiefs of the army, as the pharaoh corresponded directly with them; yet in their letters the expressions of obeisance disclose their more subordinate role and differ from those in the letters of the king in Jerusalem. In keeping with his position as chief among the captains, Ad- dudani carried on an extensive correspondence with the pharaoh, and four of his letters, written at length, are preserved. From them *H Chronicles 23:1. *In the form \"Adna\" the divine name \"Addu\" (Addu of Dan) is mutilated; this mutilation was probably the work of the holy penman, who would not admit that a man close to the pious Jehoshaphat had borne the name of Addu- Dani.

The pharaoh wrote to Addudani: LETTER 294: Hearken to thy deputy and protect the cities of the king, thy lord, which are in thy care. Addudani replied with assurances of his loyalty: LETTER 292: Thus saith Addudani, thy servant ... I have heard the words, which the long, my lord, has written to his servant: \"Pro- tect thy deputy and protect the cities of the king, thy lord.\" Behold, I protect, and, behold, I hearken day and night to the words of the king, my lord. And let the king, my lord, pay attention to his servant. After this introduction he reported on local affairs, on prepara- tions to meet the archers of the king, on caravans, on conflicts be- tween him and a deputy, on a garrison he had placed in Jaffa, and so on. The same words were written to the son \"of Zuchru\": \"Protect the cities of the king which are in thy care.\" This order is repeated in ' the reply of the son of Zuchru. The custom of repeating in epistles whole sentences from the letter being answered resulted in the preservation of valuable items out of lost tablets of the el-Amarna period. The first name of the writer is not preserved, only his second name, \"of Zuchru.\" 5 In the scriptural list of the five chiefs of Jehosha- phat, only one is called by the name of his father: Amaziah, son of Zichri. It is interesting to note that in the el-Amarna letters also, only in the case of the son of Zuchru is the name of his father at- tached. The scriptural text explains the distinction: Zichri sacrificed himself willingly to God; his descendants were honored by the name \"sons of Zichri\" (II Chronicles 17:16; 23:1). Zichri of the (Massorete) Bible is Zuchru of the el-Amarna letters; Amaziah, the son of Zichri, is the \"son of Zuchru,\" the captain who wrote to the pharaoh on matters relating to the security of his dis- trict. 6 Tetter 334. \"Letter 335."},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"242 AGES IN CHAOS lehozabad (Jehozabad) of the Second Book of Chronicles is called lahzibada in the letters he wrote to the pharaoh.

He does not enter into discussions with the pharaoh, nor does he give advice like the first in rank among the captains, but as a good soldier he accepts and acknowledges the orders of the pharaoh. Here is one of his stereotyped letters: LETTER 275: To the king, my lord, my gods, my sum, say: Thus saith lahzibada, thy servant, the dust of thy feet: At the feet of the king, my lord, my gods, my sun, seven times and seven times I fall down. The word which the king, my lord, my gods, my sun, has spoken to me, verily, I will execute it for the king, my lord. The areas of administration of Judah and Benjamin, as they were divided among the chiefs and the sari of the cities, may be deter- mined approximately by the combined information of the el-Amarna letters and the Scriptures. In Knudtzon's edition (and also in Mercer's) the el-Amarna letters are ordered according to the geographical location of their writers, the correspondents from the north preceding those from the south. It is to the credit of the in- dustrious work of Knudtzon that the letters of Addadani, son of Zuchru, and lahzibada are placed next to the letters of the king of Jerusalem; thus he correctly located these correspondents in the southern part of Palestine. Adaia, the Deputy We have in Chapter 23 of Second Chronicles a list of the chiefs in the sixteenth year after Jehoshaphat.

As previously"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"THE EL-AMARNA LETTERS 243 stated, the post of chief passed from father to son and from one brother to another, clearly marking it as a feudal institution. In that sixteenth year after Jehoshaphat there was a chief named Maaseiah, son of Adaia ( Adaja). Adaia must have lived in the days of Jehosha- phat and must have been in the service of the king. The el-Amarna letters give us a clue to his role. He was apparently the king's deputy in Edom, adjacent to Benjamin, and for some time also had charge over the gateway of Gaza through which traffic with Egypt was maintained. In the Scriptures it is said that in the time of Jehoshaphat \"there was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king\" (I Kings 22:47). This land was under the control of the king of Jerusalem and was a dependency of Judah (II Chronicles 21:8). Four times Adaia's name is mentioned in three passages in the letters of the king of Jerusalem: LETTER 285: Addaia, the deputy of the king [pharaoh] . . . LETTER 287: . . . Addaia has departed together with the garrison of the officers which the king had given. Let the king know that Adaia has said to me: \"Verily, let me depart.\" 1 LETTER 89: The garrison which thou hast sent . . . Addaia has taken and placed in his house in Hazati. These letters inform us that Adaia was a deputy of the pharaoh, and that he was subordinate to the long-regent in Jerusalem. 2 The deputy in Edom, a dependent land of Judah, was actually subordi- nate to the king of Jerusalem.

A city-prince whose name was Vidia wrote to the pharaoh from Askelon in southern Palestine. Seven tablets in the el-Amarna col- lection are signed with his name. His domain was confined to a single city. Accordingly, Vidia wrote: LETTER 320: I protect the place of the king, which is in my care. LETTER 326: I protect the city of the king, my lord. Vidia received a deputy from the pharaoh and prepared a tribute for him. In Egypt the monarch was deified as the incarnation of the god, the son of the sun, and the sun itself. In accordance with Egyptian religious beliefs the subordinate chiefs in the tributary lands ad- dressed the pharaoh thus: \"To the king, my lord, my god, my sun, the sun in heaven.\" So wrote also Vidia from Askelon. The idolatry and pagan influence made the cities around Jeru- salem \"halt between two opinions,\" to use Elijah's expression. It was therefore necessary to undertake the task of enlightening the people: \". . . and he [Jehoshaphat] went out again through the people from Beer-sheba to mount Ephraim, and brought them back unto the Lord God of their fathers\" (II Chronicles 19:4).

Because of his position the name of Amon, the governor, was placed before that of the prince of royal blood. That he was an Egyptian is implied by his name, which is the holy name of an Egyptian deity. 1 After his return to Egypt Amon was regarded by the king of Sumur (Samaria) as a friend and as an advocate of his cause before the pharaoh, and was recommended as an expert in the military and political matters of Sumur. The king of Sumur wrote to the pharaoh: LETTER 74: Verily, Aman-appa is with thee. Ask him. He knows that and has seen the distress which oppresses me. He asked Aman-appa to come again to Sumur and to bring archers with him: LETTER 77: Hast thou not said to thy lord that he sends thee at the head of the archers?

From the days of Rezon on, in consequence of Damascus* politics, which encouraged a spirit of rivalry between Israel and Judah, these two countries continued to be hostile to each other.

Hostility against Sumur has become very great is repeated in several letters from the king of Sumur (Samaria). The time was opportune. The land of Israel was visited by drought; national feeling in the Ten Tribes was dwindling. The worship of pagan images laid the northern kingdom open to the spiritual influences of the surrounding nations. Religious ties be- tween Samaria, $idon, and Damascus melted away the frontiers. Even the prophets Elijah from Gilead and Elisha, his successor- intervened in the state affairs of Damascus, visited there and were visited by people from there. In this state of spiritual and material decline the land of Samaria was a prey to the shrewd warrior and politician of Damascus. All the lands as far north as the Orontes flows were \"the lands of the king, the lord,\" the pharaoh of Egypt; but this circumstance did not prevent the Damascene from seeking to extend his domain. He was aware that the approach of the king of Assyria along the valley of the Orontes provided him with a chance to play a double game. He knew that the Egyptian king would not like to see him desert and openly go over to the war-minded Assyrians, the conquerors who pounded at the strongholds of northern Syria without declaring war on Egypt.

What did this mean? Why should the Syrian host be afraid of the governors' guard if they were not afraid of the king's army? In the battle at the wall of Samaria \"two hundred and thirty-two young men of the governors of the provinces,\" leading Samaria's small garrison, put the Syrians to flight. The answer may be found in the letters. The king of Sumur and Gubla (Jezreel), in his letters to the pharaoh and also to the governors, repeatedly asked that small de- tachments of archers be sent him. One such letter was quoted in the previous section: the governor was asked to send three hundred people to relieve the city. The bearers of the emblem of the Egyptian state (the young men of the governors of the provinces ) were a kind of gendarmerie at- tached to the governors of the pharaoh. These small detachments numbered tens, seldom hundreds, of men. In executing their duty, they were' backed by the regular troops of Egypt, and their appear- ance at the place of dispute between the vassals of the Egyptian crown heralded a definite decision on the part of the pharaoh to support one of the rivals with arms. The impatience with which such a detachment for the relief of Samaria was awaited is reflected in the following passage from a letter of the king of Sumur to Haia(?) ? a dignitary in Egypt: LETTER 71: Why hast thou held back and not said to tibe long that he should send archers that they may take Sumura?

Then said Ahab, I will send thee away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with 'him, and sent him away' (I Kings 20:31-34). From this story we learn that Ben-Hadad was defeated and cap- tured but released; a covenant was concluded with him; the Syrians had built a part of Samaria; there was a dispute between the Syrians and the Israelites about a number of cities. It appears that in the letters of the king of Sumur we have refer- ences to all these events, some of which happened only a few years before the date of the correspondence. In the 'times of distress and oppression that came later, the king of Sumur, remembering these better days, wrote to the pharaoh: LETTER 127: When, formerly, Abdi-Ashratu marched up against me, I was mighty; but, behold, now my people are crushed ...

In the Hebrew language there is a word ilpha (aleph, lamed, phe) derived from the Syrian and meaning a \"ship.\" 1 An old Hebrew word aluph (also aleph, lamed, phe) means \"a prince, lord of a clan, head of a family.\" 2 It seems to me that elippe in the el-Amarna letters must sometimes signify chieftain or the head of a small tribe. One or another city mentioned in the el-Amarna letters and presumed to be a harbor need not necessarily be a maritime city or a lake city just because elippe arrived there and did some- thing. In these instances the word is misunderstood by modern scholars, but they can be comforted by the fact that a similar mis- take was committed by the penman, who, in writing the annals of this period, used old chronicles. When Ben-Hadad with his captains fled from the battlefield of Aphek into that city, a part of the city wall collapsed and \"fell upon twenty and seven thousand\" men (I Kings 20:30). This sounds like sheer exaggeration. Aphek was not such a large city, and tens of thousands of persons would hardly be killed by a falling wall. Now eleph (again aleph, lamed, phe) is \"thousand,\" 3 and aluph is, as I have mentioned, a \"chieftain.\" It will be remembered that in the description of the feudal domains of the five chiefs of Jehoshaphat it was said that one had under him three hundred thousand men of valor, a second, two hundred and fourscore thousand, and so on. Although at the time of David men available for conscription in Judah numbered five hundred 3 See Levy, Worterbuch Hber die Talmudim und Midrashim. 3 Ibid. fl Sar-ha-eleph is a captain over a thousand.

The King of Samaria Seeks an Ally against the King of Damascus Because of one of the cities in dispute, the truce was broken. i KINGS 22:3 And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead is ours, and we be still, and take it not out of the hand of the long of Syria? The dispute over the cities of Israel, captured by the king of Damascus, is recorded scores of times in the el-Amarna letters. According to the Scriptures, in the beginning these cities were \"Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-beth-maachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land of NaphtalT (I Kings 15:20), \"cities of Israel/' which the king of Damascus smote in days gone by.

The prophet was turned over to the governor (I Kings 22:36). King Jehoshaphat, at the beginning of his reign, strengthened himself against Israel: \"And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah . . . and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken'* (II Chronicles 17:2). Later he concluded peace with Israel and agreed to join Ahab in his campaign against the king of Damascus at Ramoth-Gilead.

Was their author the scriptural Ahab or Jehoram, Ahab's son? They were written in the latter part of Jehoshaphat's reign in Jerusalem, and their contents accord with the events of that time. According to the more expanded version of the story in the Scriptures, Ahab died from the wound he received in the battle at Ramoth-Gilead; Ahaziah, his son, followed him on the throne of Israel, reigning for two years; after the death of Ahaziah, Jehoram, his brother, reigned. The less amplified but probably older version in the Scriptures implies that Ahab was apparently only wounded at Ramoth-Gilead and reigned nine years longer. The beginning of the reign of Jehoram in Israel is recorded in two contradictory statements: n KINGS 1:17 And Jehoram reigned in his [Ahaziah's] stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah. n KINGS 3:1 Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat of Judah. 1 Jehoshaphat ruled for twenty-five years. 2 The difference in these two statements consists of nine years: the last seven years of Je- hoshaphat and the first two years of his son's reign. 8 The inconsistent records of course presented difficulties to chronologists and exegetes. The question under discussion, which was only a chronological difficulty, becomes a problem of importance for the study of Pales- tinian history in the period of the el-Amarna letters, for it was during these nine years that the major part of the letters was written. The problem, it should be made clear, does not result from a comparison of the Scriptures with the el-Amarna letters, but from the divergencies in the scriptural texts. The el-Amarna letters will have to help in clarifying the question at issue.

Ahab, dying one or two years after Jehoshaphat, would have met with the experiences ascribed to his son Jehoram. He would not have died at the hand of one of Ben-Hadad's archers but would only have been wounded and would have survived Ben-Hadad. Similarly the rebellion of Mesha, king of Moab, would not have taken place after the death of Ahab but after his defeat at Ramoth- Gilead. The description of the battle at Ramoth-Gilead gives one the feeling that the hand of a later scribe tried to mingle different sources. Having been wounded by an archer, Ahab \"said unto the driver of his chariot: Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am wounded/* This indicates that the wounded Ahab abandoned the field of battle. But the next passage contradicts this: \"And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed Tip in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot\" (I Kings 22). This story closes a chapter of the drama known as the crime of Ahab, whose wife, Jezebel, gave him the vineyard of Naboth adjacent to his palace in Jezreel to build there a garden of herbs. When Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard to take possession of it, Elijah the Tishbite came to meet him there. And Ahab said to Elijah: \"Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?\" And the feared man answered: \"I have found thee. . . . Hast thou killed and also taken possession? ... In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine. The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreer (I Kings 21). In accordance with this curse, after the battle of Ramoth-Gilead \"one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his [Ahab's] blood; and they washed his armour; according unto the word of the Lord which he spake\" (I Kings 22).

Ahab humbled himself, and the misfortune fated for his lifetime was postponed to the next genera- tion. But in spite of this did the evil overtake him? The effort of the scribe to unify the diverse elements was unsuc- cessful, as there are inconsistencies in the text. This editor of the Books of Kings was helpless in the face of two different versions, and while giving preference to the tradition that Jehoram was king in Israel during the last seven years of Jehoshaphat, he did not suppress the other version, but in describing the history of the period, he evaded the issue by writing in a number of chapters the impersonal and indefinite \"king of Israel.\"* Already in the story of the battle at Ramoth-Gilead, every time the king of Jerusalem is referred to, he is called by name, Jehosha- phat, but the king of Samaria is referred to fifteen times as \"king of Israel\": \"And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat,\" \"And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat\"; in the body of the story the name of Ahab is not mentioned.

In the story of Naaman's healing there is but the recurrent Tdng of Israel\" and no name; neither does the story o attempts against the life of the \"king of Israel\" contain his name. In the long story of the second siege of Samaria, when the king met the mother who killed her child, and in the story of the rescue from this siege, not once does the name of the king accom- pany the phrase \"king of Israel.\" This is singular in the Books of Kings and Chronicles. *The annals (the Books of Kings and Chronicles) were composed during and after the Exile in Babylon, since the Exile is narrated in Chronicles and the return from the Exile in Kings. The editor of Kings indicated that his work was a compilation by referring to \"the book of the chronicles of the Icings of Israel/' which seems to have been a larger work than the canonical Chronicles. Also, the books of the prophets Nathan, Iddo, and others (not extant at the time when the Scriptures were revised and canonized) are referred to in the annals."},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"THE EL-AMARNA LETTERS 259 A contemporaneous source, which may shed light on the matter, is the stele of King Mesha of Moab. On the stele it is engraved that Omri, king of Israel, oppressed Moab many days, and \"his son suc- ceeded him; and he also said, 1 will afflict Moab.' In my days said he thus.\" Then follows: Omri took possession of the land of Medeba and (Israel) dwelt therein, during his days and half his son's days, forty years; but Chemosh restored it in my days. 5 Here is an event of importance ascribed to the reign of Ahab, son of Omri, according to one source (the stele of Mesha), and to the reign of Jehoram, son of Ahab., according to another source, one of the two scriptural versions. The Second Book of kings opens with these words: \"Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.\" This contradicts the stele of Mesha, which says that Mesha rebelled when Omri's son, had reigned only half his years. If Ahab was not killed, but only wounded, at Ramoth-Gilead, the defeat having been a signal for the rebellion of Moab, the expres- sion, \"and half the days of his [Omri's] son,\" would accord with the version that Ahab reigned during the time otherwise allotted to Jehoram. Besides the fact that the rebellion of Mesha took place not after the death of Ahab but in the middle of his reign, the figure of forty years for the reign of Omri and half of the reign of his son conflicts with the scriptural account. Forty years of oppression of Moab may be taken as a rough figure, forty being the measure of a generation, or a period of time, similar to our counting by centuries; but the account must correspond approximately to the time passed; it would suggest a longer reign for Omri and Ahab or for one of them. 6 It is recorded that Omri reigned twelve years over Israel, six of them in Tirzah (I Kings 16:23), and that Ahab reigned twenty-two years in Samaria (I Kings 16:29). Either the reign of Ahab started later than recorded or it lasted longer. Since it is said of his father, Omri, that \"six years reigned he in Tirzah\" but for twelve years he Translation by S. R.

Similarly the twenty-two years of Ahab's reign in Samaria may refer to his reign in that capital alone, the years of his reign in his new capital Jezreel not being mentioned. In one of his last letters the king of Sumur (Samaria) wrote of himself to Pharaoh Akhnaton: LETTER 137: Behold, I cannot come to the lands of Egypt. I am old, and my body is afflicted with a severe disease. Ahab could have said that he was old; not so a second son of his in the first part of his reign. The inscription of King Shalmaneser III of Assyria-Babylonia, like the stele of Mesha, conflicts with the same version of the Scrip- tures. Shalmaneser wrote that in his sixth year he battled a coalition of Syrian and Palestinian princes at Karkar. Among the princes Ahab is mentioned; he delivered an army of ten thousand soldiers and two thousand chariots to the allied host. 7 In the eighteenth year of his reign Shalmaneser wrote that he received \"a tribute of the men of Tyre, Sidon, and of Jehu, of the house of OmriJ\" 8 During the twelve years between the sixth and the eighteenth year of Shalmaneser's reign, the reign of Ahab had to come to an end, Ahaziah had to reign two years, Jehoram twelve years, and Jehu had to reign for some undefined period. But even if Ahab had died right after the battle of Karkar, and Jehu's tribute men- tioned in the inscription were paid immediately after he seized the throne, there would still not be twelve years left for Jehoram's reign. The Mesha stele thus requires the extension of Ahab's reign, and the inscription of Shalmaneser requires shortening of Jehoram's reign so as to bring Ahab closer to Jehu.

Jehoram was a son of Jehoshaphat and the son-in-law of Ahab (II Chronicles 21:6). Obviously it was Je- hoshaphat's policy to establish good relations with Israel through this alliance; he probably hoped to unite the kingdom under his son Jehoram and Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel. Jehosha- phat visited Samaria and allied himself with Ahab in his military undertakings. Ahab is said to have been killed at Ramoth-Gilead. Jehoram, his son, is said to have been wounded also at Ramoth-Gilead, under similar circumstances, with the king of Judah again an ally in the battle (II Kings 8:28). Many other details ascribed to the reigns of these two kings of Israel bear the mark of confusing similarity. The annalist placed an Ahaziah and a Jehoram in Israel and an- other Jehoram and another Ahaziah in Judah. The state of things as he found them in older chronicles was probably confusing. Possibly Jehoram, son of Jehoshaphat, acted as a regent, suc- ceeding Ahab, his father-in-law, and Ahaziah, son of Ahab, who died after a short reign and a long illness. Of Jehoram it is said: \"And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife/* 11 There- after the throne of Israel was seized by Jehu, and Jehoram was killed, together with Ahaziah of Judah. Ahab's daughter Athaliah, wife of Jehoram, seized the throne of Jerusalem when her husband and son were killed. Following the description of the assassination of Jehoram and Ahaziah by Jehu, the Second Book of Kings relates: \"And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria.'' Jehu sent letters to the elders of Samaria with the challenge: \"Look even out the best and meetest of your master's sons, and set him on his father's throne.\" The king who is called here \"your master\" was Ahab, not Jehoram, son of Ahab, 10 It seems problematic that Ahab, who persecuted the cult of Yahwe, would have called his son Tehoram ( Jahwe is exalted).

A later annalist might well be misled if contemporaries were mistaken. Regardless of whether this hypothesis concerning Jehoram is correct or incorrect, the documents of Mesha, of Shalmaneser, and of el-Amarna unanimously support the version of the Scriptures ac- cording to which Ahab was alive during the last seven years of Je- hoshaphat's reign.

It opens with these words: \"I am Mesha, son of Chemosh, king of Moab, the Daibonite [Dibonite] 1 . My father reigned over Moab for thirty years, and I reigned after my father. And I made this high place for Chemosh in KRKHH, a high place of salvation, because he had saved me from all the assailants, and because he had let me see my desire upon all them that hated me. \"Omri, king of Israel, afflicted Moab for many days, because Chemosh was angry with his land. And his son succeeded him; and he also said, I will afflict Moab. In my days said he thus; but I saw my desire upon him and upon his house, and Israel perished with an everlasting destruction.\" 2 Mesha recorded that he restored Medeba; built Baal-Meon and Kiryathen; fought against Atarofh, the dwelling place of Gad from of old, fortified by the king of Israel, and slew all the people of that city. The oracle of Chemosh told him, \"Go, take Nebo against Israel,\" and he took it and slew all that were in it, seven thousand men and boys and women and girls and maidservants. \"And the king of Israel had built Yahas, and abode in it, while he fought against me. But Chemosh drave him out from before me; and I took , . . it to add it unto Daibon.\" Then Mesha built and repaired the walls and palace in Karkhah with the slave labor of the prisoners of Israel, and it is recounted in more detail; he also built other places* He continued with the war and went against the Israelite city of Horonen, and here the record is interrupted; the lines are de- faced, but it may be presumed that other war exploits against Israel were recorded. \"And F can be read a few more times.

The cities mentioned on the stele are in Trans- Jordan, but Karkhah is not known. Every word and every letter and every obliterated portion were objects of careful examination: the stele of Mesha is regarded as the greatest single discovery in biblical archaeology, especially as it provides a parallel record to a scriptural narrative. The Book of Kings relates that \"there was great indignation against Israel\" at the attempt to subjugate Moab, which rebelled; on what form this indignation took, the record is silent. The Book of Chronicles discloses that the Moabites, together with the Am- monites, invaded Palestine with the help of the Syrians. From the Mesha stele we know that Mesha, king of Moab, took his revenge by an \"everlasting destruction\" of Israel, and that Mehedeba, Ataroth, Nebo, and Yahas were retaken. The \"everlasting destruc- tion\" is not to be seen merely in the recapture of f our or five not very significant places in Trans-Jordan. The cuneiform letters of el-Amarna, found twenty years after the discovery of the Mesha stele, are regarded as historical documents preceding the stele of Mesha by some five hundred and fifty years, and relating to the Canaanite period. The present research shows that the documents are contemporaneous, having been written in the middle of the ninth century. In letters from Palestine, and especially in those written by the long of Samaria, we should expect to find direct reference to the rebellion of Mesha. We should also expect to find mention of events, the record of which was carved on the lower, missing part of the stele of Mesha. And, in fact, the letters of el-Amarna bear extensive witness to the history of that war, and also give us material with which to reconstruct roughly the missing part of the stele. Already in the earliest preserved letter of the king of Sumur (Samaria) he had written to the pharaoh (Amenhotep III): LETTER 68: Let the king, my lord, know . * . the hostility of the sa.gaz.Me$h troops is very great against me. So let not the king, my lord, hold back from Sumur that it be not quite annexed to the sa.gazMesh troops.

Sometimes the intruding pillagers are called amelut sa-gaz-Mesh, amelut being the men or the people; sometimes the text speaks of gaz-Mesh as of a single person, and the translators again neglect \"Mesh\" and translate \"robber.\" \"He takes thy cities the amel-gaz- Mesh, the dog,\" and the words are rendered \"the gaz man,\" Mesh being dropped. But the text speaks in these cases of a single person, and therefore Mesh cannot here be the suffix for the plural. I shall not translate Mesh either, because it is the personal name of King Mesha, but I shall not omit it from the text of the transla- tion. Thus we shall read: \"The hostility of the rebels [pillagers] of Mesh is very great against me\"; and in the other sentence: \"He takes thy cities, the rebel Mesh, the dog.\" 3 According to the inscription on the stele of Mesha, the revolt took place in the middle of Ahab's reign.

Then he was warned that \"the land of the king and Sumur, your garrison town,\" would unite with the people of the rebel Mesh (amelu-gaz-Mesh) , and \"thou held back.\" 1 The king of Sumur asked for archers, making it clear that he was unable to defend his land against the troops of the rebel Mesh. 2 The help did not come.

It is also possible that the Mesha stele may have been but one part of a twin inscription on two monoliths, each of which carried half the story. That we have only the top portion of the stele is evident; that there were two steles is not impossible. In any event we have to re- examine the stele of Mesha, and in doing this, it may be that we shall see things to which we paid insufficient attention before. After the capture of the city of Yahas the king of Moab, at war with Israel, turned to building activities in an unidentified place: \"I built KRKHH [Karkhah], the wall of Yearim [or of the For- ests], and the wall of Ophel.

Some scholars have thought that it was a portion of the city of Dibon. Another con- jecture was that it represents the city of Kir-ha-Kharoshet. For some reason mention of this building activity in Karkhah is the central theme of this stele, and this, together with the reference to Karkhah in the introductory passage, lends emphasis to the importance of the activities there during the war against the Israelites* With the help of die el-Ainarna letters it may be assumed that KRKHH was the capital of the entire Egyptian domain in Palestine, or Sumur (Samaria), which Mesha, the rebel, entered after his sue-"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"THE EL-AMARNA LETTERS (CONTINUED) 275 cess in overcoming the resistance of the fortified cities to the east. Samaria on a straight line is about twenty miles from the Jordan, the border of Ammon. Kerakh or Karkha is in Hebrew \"a very large city, encircled by a wall, to which foreigners come yearly for trade purposes/* 8 that is, a metropolis. 4 According to the inscription of Mesha, in Karkhah there was \"Ophel,\" the wall of which he built or repaired. In the Scriptures a part of the city called \"OpheF is mentioned only with respect to Jerusalem and Samaria. Gehazi, the servant of Elisha, \"the prophet that is in Samaria,\" returning to the house of his master with the presents from Naaman, parted from the servants of the sar when they reached Ophel in the city of Samaria (II Kings 5:24). Refer- ence to Ophel in Karkhah on the stele of Mesha is of unquestionable value. The king's palace (beth-melech) , so often mentioned in the el- Amarna letters as being in Sumur, and unearthed in the Samaria of Omri and Ahab (Sebastieh of today), is also spoken of as being in Karkhah or the metropolis of the Mesha stele. The attitude of Mesha in conquering the capital, \"the city of the king [pharaoh]/* was characteristic indeed. He repaired the city, its palace, and its walls. In his estimation it did not belong to the king of Israel. It belonged to the pharaoh. Whoever built in it showed his peaceful attitude toward Egypt, and also acquired the right to be regarded as the senior among the vassal princes of Syria-Pales- tine. In other letters, written from northern Syria, it is said that the following places, possibly outside the domain of Israel, were de- spoiled by the rebels of Mesh (Mesha): Mahzibti, Gilutii, Magdali, and Uste, also Tahsi and Ubi. 6 Like a turbulent wind, the Arabs attacked the land from all direc- \"Levy, Worterbuch tiber die Tdmudim und Midrashim. *This well-known word is written with two khaf letters; in the inscription of Mesha the letters are khuf and heth, the other characters for k and kh.

The stele was prepared to be erected in Karkhah-Samaria, but was left in Dibon. The vassal triumphed over his lord and the lord of his lord and probably received a ransom. This is what was meant by the \"great indignation\" of the biblical text and the \"everlasting de- struction\" of the Mesha stele.

How this happened is told in the Second Book of Kings, in Chapters 6-7. In accordance with that record, we find this statement by the king of Sumur (Samaria): LETTER 106: They have been able to oppress it [Sumur] but they have not been able to conquer it.

It informs., us in passing that the Syrians were prowling about in bands (as often mentioned in the el-Amarna letters) and carrying away captives out of the land of Israel, and that among these captives was an Israelite girl who became a handmaid in the household of the captain. The members of the household advised him to try the treatment of the prophet in Samaria. And the king of Syria said to Naaman: \"Go to, go, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel/* When the king of Israel received the letter, he rent his clothes. \"Am I God,\" he asked, \"that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy? wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me.\" Elisha the seer intervened when he heard that the king had rent his clothes. The story of how Elisha healed Naaman the captain is well known, 1 In the quoted portion of the story, two facts are somewhat strange. First, inasmuch as Ben-Hadad himself was at the head of the thirty-two captains of his army, 2 why, in this story of the won- drous healing, is the deliverance of Syria credited to a captain Naaman? Second, the king of Israel was a lifelong rival of the king of Damascus. Why, then, did this request to cure a sick captain in- spire in the king of Israel such dread that he rent his clothes? For an explanation of the real role of this captain Naaman we shall look to the contemporaneous letters. A man by whom Syria received deliverance must be identifiable in the letters. We recog- nize him in the person of lanhama, called also laanhamu. lanhama, the pharaoh's deputy in Syria, was sent to the king of Damascus with prerogatives similar to those which Aman-appa had when he was with the king of Samaria. Naaman's title in the Scrip- tures sar is also used in the letters. He was a plenipotentiary of the king of Egypt, in charge of the army and walled cities in Amuru land (Syria), later also the overseer of stores of grain. He had great *He ordered seven baths in the Jordan.

At various times he is reported to have been in Syria and in Egypt, favoring a policy of balanced relations in Syria in view of the necessity to secure the position of Damascus in the Syrian bloc against the \"king of Hatti.\" Accordingly it is said in the Second Book of Kings that through Naaman, \"a great man with his master, and honourable . . . the Lord had given deliverance unto Syria.\" In the early letters of the king of Sumur (Samaria) his fear of the mighty deputy of the pharaoh is plainly expressed. In one letter he wrote to the pharaoh: \"Thou must rescue me out of the hand of laanhamu.\" 5 He asked the pharaoh to inform his deputy that he, lanhama, would be responsible if anything should happen to the person of the king of Samaria. \"Say to lanhamu: 'Rib-Addi is even in thy hands, and all that will be done to him rests upon thee/ \" 6 *As, for example, Dudu, referred to later in this chapter. *Mercer, Tell el-Amarna Tables, p. 297.

I hear from the mouth of the people that he is a wise man and all people love him,\" 8 We recall the scriptural words about Naaman, that he was an \"honourable\" man. What happened that the king of Samaria, who once feared lan- hama and asked to be rescued from his hand, should now himself recommend that very man for the governorship of Samaria? In an- other letter he again asks the pharaoh to send lanhama and in the next one he praises him in these words: \"There is no servant like lanhama, a faithful servant to the king.\" 9 lanhama wrote from Egypt to the king of Samaria: \"Go and occupy Sumur until I come . . . enter, fear not,\" 10 and the king of Sumur (Samaria) wrote him, in the hope that the pharaoh would appoint lanhama: \"Hasten very quickly thy arrival/' and explained that because of the hostility of the people of Ambi he was unable to enter Samaria. The letters do not show why the fear of the king of Samaria changed into confidence with respect to the Syrian deputy. The Scriptures provide the explanation in the story of the healing of Naaman by the prophet of Samaria. Naaman was very grateful to the prophet, and also to the king of Samaria, to whom he came with a letter from the king of Damascus. \"Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel\" (II Kings 5:15). Elisha even declared that he would heal Naaman in order to help the king of Israel politically. So he became a friend. When the king of Damascus was killed, as will be narrated on a subsequent page, lanhama (Naaman) was apparently in Egypt.

This appears in the story of the healing: he gave to the servant of the prophet two talents of silver and two changes of garments, more than the servant had asked for, when the prophet refused to take ten talents of silver, six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment. It is of interest to find that, according to the letters, lanhama was in charge of the pharaoh's treasury in Syria, being over \"money and clothing.\" 11 Paying with a combination of money and clothing is a true custom of that time. In one letter the king of Sumur wrote that he paid \"thirteen silvers and one pair of garments\" for someone to go on an errand. 12 According to the Scriptures, the Syrian governor had in his house an Israelite girl, a captive carried off by a Syrian band, who waited on his wife. 18 In an early letter of the king of Sumur (Samaria) to the pharaoh there is a complaint that two people from his domain are detained in the private home of lanhama. 14 The el-Amarna letters also speak of him as the generous patron of a Palestinian youth, who was educated in Egypt at his expense. 15 The man \"by whom the Lord had given deliverance unto Syria\" and who was feared by the king of Samaria was lanhama. 16 How this captain changed his attitude and became a supporter of the long of Samaria is recorded in the letters and is explained by the Scriptures.

It is told in the Scriptures that Hazael \"returned to his lord\" in Damascus after greeting Elisha. Calling his father, the king, \"lord\" is entirely in keeping with the customs and the language. Hazael was not the lawful heir to the throne. Like Ahab, who had one queen but many wives and seventy sons by them in Samaria, Ben-Hadad probably had many sons. From an inscription of Shal- maneser it may be inferred that Hazael was born of a concubine; \"Hazael, son of nobody, seized the throne.\" 6 In the el-Amarna letters he is persistently called slave* But if Menander's story about Abd\" Astartus, grandson of Hiram, is the story of Abdi-Ashirta, also called Abdu-Astarti, 7 the scrip- tural Ben-Hadad, then the king of Damascus was killed by the sons of his nurse.

Hazael, \"the Dog/' Burns the Strongholds of Israel The reign of Hazael (Azaru, Aziru) proved to be even more disastrous for the realm of Israel than the reign of the slain king of Damascus. The famine still plagued the people of Samaria in the days of King Hazael as in the days of his father. Samaria was in a state of almost constant siege and changed hands over a period of more than five years. 1 The king of Sumur (Samaria) wrote: LETTER 125: Aziru has again oppressed me. . . . My cities belong to Aziru, and he seeks after me. . . . What are the dogs, the sons of Abdi-Ashirta, that they act according to their heart's wish, and cause the cities of the king to go up in smoke? This is almost exactly what Elisha said when, before the gates of Damascus, he announced to Hazael that he would be king over Syria: n KINGS 8:11-13 . . . and the man of God wept And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? and he answered, Be- cause I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel: their strongholds wilt thou set on fire . . . And Hazael said, But what, is thy servant a dog, that he should do this great thing? His expression, \"is thy servant a dog . . . ?\" which accidentally escaped oblivion, was a typical figure of speech at the time of the el-Amarna letters. Many chieftains and governors concluded their letters with this sentence: *ls tihy servant a dog that he shall not hear the words of the king, the lord?\" In referring to Aziru (Hazael), in many a letter the king of Sumur (Samaria) and other dispatchers of messages also use the word '\"Letter 157.

Another figure of speech out of the mouth of Hazael in the Scrip- tures is repeated in his letters. When Hazael went to meet the prophet Elisha he said: II KINGS 8:9 Thy son Ben-Hadad king of Syria hath sent me to thee. In his letters to Dudu in Egypt Aziru wrote; LETTER 158: To Dudu, my lord, my father. Thus saith Aziri, thy son, thy servant. He employed the expressions, \"thy son/' \"thy servant,\" in letters and in conversation to show respect. In the only dialogue preserved in the Scriptures in which Hazael participates, there are three turns of speech that also appear in his letters. The context of the dialogue the question of whether the king of Damascus would survive, and the statement that he, Hazael, the new king, would cause the cities (of Israel) to go up in smoke is also preserved in the el-Amarna letters. It is therefore a precious example of the authenticity of the scriptural orations and dialogues. At this point it is appropriate to quote one of the letters of Aziru (Hazael) to this mighty man in Egypt who is called Dudu. It will give us an idea of who was the secret force in the colonial office of Egypt which supported Abdi-Ashirta and his son in their adven- turous campaigns in Syria and Palestine.

The king of Samaria complained that many of his messages went unanswered and did not receive due at- tention. This Dudu, whose splendid sepulcher is preserved among the tombs of the courtiers of Akhnaton in Akhet-Aton (Tell el-Amarna), is thought to have been of Semitic origin. His reward at the hand of the pharaoh was celebrated by some Asiatics, as the murals in the tomb witness. 2 These Asiatics were Syrians. The name Dudu is a Semitic name of the Kings period in Palestine. It appears in the Scriptures as Dodo (II Samuel 23:9, 24). It is conceivable that this Dudu was a descendant of Hadad the Edomite, who was an adversary of Solomon and who married into the royal house of Egypt (I Kings 11:19). Dudu, the chamberlain and the \"chief mouthpiece of all the foreign lands/' as he described himself in an inscription in his sepulchral hall, made matters easier for Aziru (Hazael), and some of the tablets of the king of Sumur (Samaria) waited twenty-seven centuries before receiving attention.

The conspiracy in the army, which opposed Hazael, broke out, and the revolt struck Jezreel. Jehu drove furiously to Jezreel and killed Jehoram, previously wounded in a battle with the Syrians, and Ahaziah, who had come from Jerusalem to visit him. Jezebel was thrown out of the window, and Jehu's horses trod upon her, and her flesh was torn by dogs in the field of Naboth, leaving for burial only the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands.

It is a fact that in Syria, in the time of Josephus Flavius, nine hundred years after the time I describe, these two kings were honored as great builders and great conquerors and great characters, and the people of Damascus cherished the memory of these national heroes and saints. Josephus, after describing the act of murder, wrote: \"Adados and Azaelos who ruled after him are to this day honored as gods because of their benefactions and the building of temples with which they adorned the city of Damascus.

The attention given to the historical events and even to some minor happenings of the period with which this chapter deals is due mainly to the fact that the priceless el-Amarna letters were written at that time, and they provide rich material for parallels. From the standpoint of the biblical narrative, the importance lent to the period is enhanced, for the letters deal with the mist-shrouded time of Elijah and Elisha, the seers.

Some intima- tion has been found that Nikmed was expelled by the Babylonians, 2 who are called here Hatti. This suggestion is not far from the truth, since Babylon was incorporated by Shalmaneser into his empire. We arc curious to know whether Shalmaneser left any written record of his conquest of Ugarit.

Shalmaneser III Is Opposed by a Syrian Coalition under Biridri (Biridia), the Commandant of Megiddo Shalmaneser relates that in his sixth year, two years after he drove King Nikdem into the sea, a prince named Biridri, helped by a coalition of twelve princes, opposed him at Karkar. 1 Among Biridrf s allies were Ahab, the prince of Israel (\"with two thousand chariots and ten thousand warriors'* ), the city of Irqata (no prince is named), the prince of Arvad, Matinu-Bali, the prince of Usa (not named), and the prince of Siana, Adunu-Bali.

They wrote to the pharaoh that they were holding their gar- risons in readiness to take a stand against the invading king of Hatti, and some of them from northern Syria, which was more im- mediately threatened than Palestine might have taken part per- sonally in the battle.

Two letters of Mut-Balu are preserved. He wrote to the pharaoh: LETTER 255: Let the king, my lord, send caravans to Karaduniash. I will bring them in so that they be completely safe. Since Karaduniash is Babylon 3 and the city of Mut-Balu is on the way to Babylon, we may guess that Mut-Balu of the el-Amarna letters was Matinu-Bali, the king of Arvad, mentioned in the As- syrian inscription of Shalmaneser* Mut-Balu did not say from where he wrote his letter. The Assyrian inscription, by calling Matinu-Bali the king of Arvad, connects Mut-Balu of the letters with that city. From Joscphus, who quoted Menander, 4 we have the in- formation that Metten-Baal was a grandson of Ithobal [Ethbaal] and a nephew of Jezebel Uzu (Usa) was near Tyre. Tyre was on an island near the shore. It did not have enough drinking water to withstand a siege. In those rainless years the king of Tyre asked the pharaoh to transfer the city of Uzu to the domain of Tyre, LKTTKH ISO: Let the king direct his attention towards his servant and give him Uzu in order that he may live, and in order that he may drink water. In both sources, in the inscription of Shalmaneser and in the letters, we have met Irqata, Arvada, and Uzu as small principalities opposing the invader coming from the north. Megiddo was the strong military base behind these outposts. It had been fortified by Thutmose III, whose campaign and victory at Megiddo were emphasized in his annals. The city was a barrier in the path of the armies coming from the north. Its garrison also guarded the plain of Esdraelon (Jezreel).

Megiddo, as the letters reveal, was a fortress, which Jehu would not have dared to enter in his pursuit of Ahaziah. But Ahaziah did not succeed in escaping: he was trapped and killed in his flight to Megiddo (II Kings 9:27). The walls of Megiddo, once a formidable structure, when ex- cavated were found to be very similar in construction and workman- ship to the walls of Ahab's palace at Samaria, dating from the ninth century. 5 Biridia, as commander of the most important fortress, was the man to lead the coalition of the vassal kings against the \"king of Hatti.\" 6 The rank and position of Biridia of the el-Amarna letters correspond to those of Biridri of the Shalmaneser inscription. The slightly different spelling of the names is due to the fact that not only personal but even geographical names were spelled in the let- ters in different ways: the same Biridia (in one instance he wrote his name Biridi) announced to the pharaoh that he was defending Makida; another time he wrote that he was defending Magiidda. There are many similar examples in the letters. Biridia, on watch at the stronghold of Megiddo, met the king of Assyria, the enemy of the pharaoh, and it was the chariots under his command that Shalmaneser took captive, \"See C. S.

The letters of el-Amarna, when assigned to their proper time, make these theories superfluous. The presence of a small contingent of Egyptian soldiers in the allied army under Biridia is in accord with the contents of the el-Aniarna letters. Biridia also sent regular reports to the pharaoh about his preparations to meet the king of Hatti on the battlefield. In a number of letters the king of Sumur reported to the pharaoh the danger impending from the king of Hatli. In an early letter he wrote: \"Let the king, my lord, know that the king of Hatti has over- come all lands, which belonged to the king of Mitta or the king of Nahma the land of the great kings. Abdi-Ashirta, the slave, the dog, has gone with him,** The successes of the king of Hatti in Mitanni (Mitta) were only temporary, for King Tushratta of Mi- tanni, the father-in-law of the pharaoh, was able to send, among other numerous and rich presents, some of \"the booty of the land of Hatti/' and by this he let his son-in-law know that he was not de- feated. The records of Shalmaneser, aside from his conquest of Babylon at the time of a dynastic war between two Babylonian princes, do not chronicle any decisive victory or permanent terri- torial acqxiisition in the east* Almost every year during the first two decades of his reign Shal- maneser renewed his southern campaigns into Syria.

His information that the king of Hatti burned cities to the ground was true. Shalmaneser himself wrote: \"I destroyed, I devastated, I burned with fire,\" a statement he often repeated; after his sixteenth march into Syria he perpetuated his deeds with these words: \"Countless cities I destroyed, I devastated, I burned with fire\" The same was reported in many letters of Syrian city-princes to the pharaok Rib-Addi in a still later letter 11 wrote about the exploits of the king of Hatti, but these lines are destroyed, and we can read among the defaced characters only the words \"king of the Hatti lands.\" Shalmaneser, the Assyrian king of the ninth century, was, ac- cording to this reconstruction of history, the king of Hatti of the el-Amarna letters. After he secured the domain he inherited from his father, Assurnasirpal, and increased it by the conquest of Bab- ylon and of other areas, he wrote: The land of Hatti to its farthest border I brought under my sway. From the source of the Tigris to the source of the Euphrates my hands conquered. 12 Hatti is here apparently a broad geographical designation, not an ethnographical name. When the Syrians tinder the walls of Samaria thought they heard an army approaching to relieve the city, they imagined that it was either the army of Egypt or of Hatti (II Kings 7:6). The latter means, apparently, the army of Shalmancser. He put all other coun- tries in a state of defense, and the pharaoh was regarded as his only real rival. Their rivalry in matters of Syria is perfectly reflected in the el-Amarna letters. \"Letter 126. \"Letter 129. ^uckenbill, Records of Assyria, I, Sec. 641."},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"THE EL-AMARNA LETTERS (CONCLUDED) 315 Shalmaneser III Invades Amuru Land and Is Opposed by the King of Damascus In the tenth year of his reign Shalmaneser fought against another coalition, again under Biridri (Biridia).

In Egypt, Aziru (Hazael) was suspected of being on the side of \"the king of Hatti\" as his father at one time had been 1 for he re- ceived messengers from the king of Hatti. At the same time he begged the pharaoh to confirm his status as king of Damascus, the throne of which he had tisurped. He was summoned to Egypt, but he repeatedly delayed his departure with the excuse that the move- ments of the king of Hatti had to be watched: \"If the king of Hatti comes for hostility against me, then, O king, my lord, give me sol- diers and chariots for my assistance/' But he was questioned: << Why hast thou taken care of the messengers of the king of Hatti?

May the king of Hatte depart/' In a letter to the pharaoh he conceded that he had \"arrived formerly to the king from [of] Hatte/' 3 but now ho looks only in the face of the sun, his lord (Akhnaton). \"And the king of Hatte comes to Amurri, the land of ^Letter 75, *A similar punishment was meted out to the brothers of Ahab's heir by Jehu's order. \"Letter 165."},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"316 AGES IN CHAOS the king, my lord . , . f or now he dwells in Nuhasse, two one-day's journey to Tunip,* and I am afraid that he will oppress Tunip.

The annals of Shalmaneser also verify what was said in the el-Amarna letters concerning Hazael (Aziru): **In my eighteenth year of reign, I crossed the Euphrates for the sixteenth time. Hazael of Aram [Amuru] came forth to battle.\" He wrote that Hazael made his stand at Mount Senir (Anti- Lebanon), \"Mount Saniru, a mountain peak which is in front of Mount Lebanon.\" This strategic position of Hazael protected Tunip (Baalbek). In the battle Shalmaneser captured 1121 chariots. \"As far as Damascus, his royal city, I advanced. His orchards I cut down.\" Four years later Shalmaneser, according to his annals, went \"against the cities of Hazael of Aram [Amuru]\" and \"captured four of his cities.* The Phoenicians Leave for a New Home From the annals of Shalmaneser we know that he subjugated the seacoast of Syria as far as Tyre.

Abimilki, king of Tyre, wrote several tablets to the pharaoh, reassuring him: LETTER 147: Behold, I protect Tyre, the great city, for the king, my lord. And again, LETTER 149: The king, my lord, has appointed me to protect Tyre, the handmaid of the king. The pharaoh requested Abimilki to give him information about the cities of Syria. Abimilki wrote that Aziru (Hazael) had con- quered Sumura (Samaria); that the city of Danuna in Syria was quiet ( Shalmaneser passed through this city in his second year he called it Dihnunu); Abimilki also wrote that half the city of Ugarit was destroyed by fire, that the other half of the city was despoiled, and that the soldiers of the Hatti army had left there, Shalmaneser captured Ugarit, the city of Nikdem, in the fourth year of his reign. With the fall of Danuna and Ugarit to Shalmane- ser, the position of Tyre was very much endangered, especially be- cause of the feud between that city and Sidon as reflected in the el-Amarna letters, and also because of the pillaging tribes that ap- proached Tyre from across the Jordan. Tyre on the rock was de- pendent on the coast not only for water supply but also for the wood necessary in shipbuilding. In his plight Abimilki wrote that lie was a *serf of tears\" and pleaded for help. And when finally he received word that the fleet of the pharaoh would arrive at Tyre he sent out his mariners to meet tibe Egyptian navy* He was encouraged for a while and wrote again that he would defend the city.

He used to tell the pharaoh that he, the august overlord, \"thundereth in the heavens like Adad.\" It should be noted here that this was the same attribute that Shal- maneser in his inscriptions applied to himself: \"I thundered like Adad, the Storm-god.\" Shalmeneser also wrote, \"Shalmeneser, the mighty king, the sun of all peoples.** Akhnaton and Shalmaneser both claimed to be the sun, and before long Abimilki knew that there were two suns, a violent one in the Two-Stream Land and an inactive one in Egypt. Abimilki still paid respect to the pharaoh and called him \"the eternal sun/* but in his long last letter he no longer wrote to the pharaoh as to the sole sovereign, and it was clearly made known to the pharaoh that Abimilki also bowed before another lord.

Further: let my lord, the king, as there is no wood, no water, no straw, no earth, no place for the dead, let the long, my lord, care for the servant of Shalmajati that life be given to him. Bizarre conjectures were published to explain the meaning of that perplexing name Shalmaiati. Without taking into consideration the contemporaneous account of Shalmaneser, who in his eighteenth year received tribute from Tyre and Sidon, the change in the over- lordship of Tyre is easily misunderstood. Shalmaiati could not be another name of the pharaoh, because Abimilki called himself Pharaoh's servant and the servant of Shalmaiati. It was also pro- posed 2 that the word be read \"M^ya-ati\" and to identify it with Meryt-aten, a daughter of Akhnaton, It has been admitted that the \"By W. F.

It was observed, however, that a sign which usually accompanied the name of a deity was missing every time Shalmaiati was named in the letter. Who, then, could he have been? And yet, in disregard of both facts that Shalmaiati and the pharaoh could not be the same person, and that Shalmaiati could not be a deity it was supposed that Shalmaiati was the name of a god, equivalent to the sun or Aton of Akhnaton, but that here this god is invoked as an alter ego of Akhnaton, which makes the sign of divinity unnecessary, and yet is an indication of a second personality. 4 Abimilkfs last letter is not yet ended. What should we like to read in it? Of course, about the departure of the people of Tyre and other Phoenician cities on their ships from the grievous yoke of Shalmaneser and from the recurrent drought, to look for a new haven along the shores of the Mediterranean. We know that it was in the days of Shalmaneser and in fear of him that the refugees from Tyre and other Phoenician cities fled and laid the foundations of Carthage, This last letter of Abimilki closes with the words: LETTER 155: Let the king set his face towards his servant and Tyre the city of Shalmaiati . . . Behold, the man of Beruta [Beirut] has gone in a ship, and the man of Zidon goes away iu two ships, and I go away with all thy ships and my whole city. The dramatic meaning of this letter becomes evident. Abimilki wrote that he would desert his rocky island and evacuate the popu- lation of Tyro. He begged the pharaoh to take care of what would remain in the deserted city, which was bound by tribute to a king invader. *\". . , nor is it clear what tho etymology of the word is.\" Mercer, Tett el- Amarna Tablets, pp. 504-5.

The king of Hatti, always feared and often mentioned in the letters of the Syrian princes, might well have been one of the cor- respondents of the el-Amarna collection. Although in continued conflict with Egypt, he never made open war against the pharaoh; at least the pharaoh never sent a strong army to the assistance of his Syrian vassals. It is probable, therefore, that they exchanged letters. It is generally accepted that Suppiluliuma, of whom only one very amiable letter is preserved, was the feared king of Hatti. A number of generations later another Suppiluliuma was \"a king of Hatti\" and therefore it appeared reasonable that Suppiluliuma of the el-Amarna period also had been a great king of Hatti. Actually, in the time of Shalmaneser III (in the ninth century) there lived a prince called Suppiluliuma (Sapalulme), to whom Shalmaneser referred in his annals. 1 He could have been the author of the letter in the el-Amarna collection signed with his name. 2 In a short and broken text from Ugarit referring to donations made to the goddess of the city of Arne, Prince Nikmed of Ugarit- Ras Shamra as well as Suppiluliuma are mentioned. 3 Apparently Nikmed and Suppiluliuma, too, donated to the goddess of Arne. Arne was not far from Ugarit and was captured by Shalmaneser III in one of his campaigns. \"Against the cities of Arame (personal name) I drew near. Arne his royal city I captured.\" 4 Besides establishing the identity of Shalmaneser III and the king of Hatti, the invader from the north at the time of the el-Amarna correspondence, there is a basis for suggesting an identification of the king of Hatti as one of the el-Amarna correspondents.

It is well known from many instances that in Nineveh and in Bab- ylon the king used various names. 6 Shalmaneser wrote of himself: \"Shalmaneser, the mighty king, king of the universe, the king without a rival, the autocrat . , , who shatters the might of the princes of the whole world, who has smashed all of his foes like pots, the mighty hero, the unsparing,** It also seems that Shalmaneser alone in his time would have written in the manner of Burraburiash. Burraburiash was very haughty and wrote letters often bordering on insult. Under the pre- text of an indisposition he refused to grant an audience to the mes- senger of the pharaoh (\"his messenger has never eaten food nor drunk date wine in my presence\"); then, although the pharaoh was the injured party, Burraburiash said that he was angry \"I poured forth my wrath toward my brother\" because he had not received the message of solicitude to which an indisposed sovereign was entitled. But when he was informed, through the close ques- tioning of his own messenger, that the road was long and that in the short period of time Pharaoh could not have responded to the news of his indisposition, he added to the same letter: \"I no longer poured forth to thee my wrath.'* Then he found fault with the pharaoh's gifts: \"The forty minas of gold which they brought when I pxit them in the furnace, did not come out full weight.\" He called on him \"to make good his loss'' of a caravan plundered in Syria. \"Khinshi is thy land and its kings are thy servants,\" therefore \"bind them, and the money which they have stolen, make good/* He also wrote: *Do not retain my messenger, let him come quickly/* He ordered various art objects to be made and sent to him as presents: \"Let experts, who are with thee, make animals, either of ^Letter 9: \"Assyrians, my subjects/* *See article \"Babylonia\" m Encyclopaedia Biblica, ed.

All clues point to the identification of Burraburiash with Shalmaneser of the Assyrian inscriptions, with Shalmaiati of the letter of the king of Tyre, and with the 'Icing of Hatti.\" There exists a very long register of gifts sent by Akhnaton to Burraburiash. 7 After an extensive enumeration of objects of gold, silver, precious stones, and ivory, the list mentions animals, but this part is defaced, and only \"ibex\" (durah) is discernible. The list gives the impression of being tribute rather than a gift, and the letters of Burraburiash indicate that gifts delivered in excessive quantities were not made on an entirely voluntary basis. Treasures found in the tomb of Tutankhamen, the son-in-law of Akhnaton, are unequaled by any other archaeological discovery in Egypt or elsewhere, but they are trifles compared with the presents Akhnaton sent to Burraburiash. The list opens with the words: LETTER 14: These are the objects which Naphururia, the great king, king of Egypt [sar Miisrii] sent to his brother Burnaburiash the great king, king of Karaduniash [Babylon]. Shalmaneser pictured on an obelisk the presentation of the tribute from various lands. One of these lands was Musri (Egypt) : \"Tribute of the land of Musri.\" In addition to gold, and more appreciated than this metal., there were rare animals described as camels with two humps, a river ox, and other land and water creatures, some of which are depicted. It is conceivable that these were figures of animals \"of land and river\" in compliance with the demand ex- pressed in the quoted letter.

Shalmancser wrote that \"the land of Hatti to its farthest border I brought under my sway/' He wrote also, \"I received gifts from 'all the kings of Hatti.\" 8 In the letters of el-Amarna the invading king is called \"the king of Hatti/' His destruction of numerous cities by fire is mentioned in his inscriptions and also in the letters of el- Amarna; vestiges of the conflagration are visible in the ruins of Ugarit. \"The chilling terror'' of his arms, which, according to his annals, filled the kings of the land of Amuru, finds expression in many letters. Cities and princes who wrote to the pharaoh about the approach of the invader are also mentioned in the annals of Shalmaneser as those who, with the assistance of Egypt (Musri), fought against him in the sixth year of his reign. They fought again in his eleventh year, and once more in his fourteenth year. From the commander of this coalition, Biridri of the Assyrian annals, or Biridia of the letters (written also Biridi), there are military reports to the pharaoh about his preparations for defense against the aggressor.

The similarity of expression in the el-Amarna letters from Pales- tine and in the prophets and psalmists did not pass unnoticed, and identical turns of speech were detected and stressed. Here are some examples. 1 Loyalty is expressed by the metaphor, \"to lay the neck to the yoke and bear it,\" in the letters of Yakhtiri (lahtiri) and Baal-miir 2 and similarly in Jeremiah 27:llf.

The king of Jerusalem wrote to Pharaoh that \"because he has his name upon Jerusalem for ever, the city cannot be neglected/* words that remind us of a passage in Jeremiah 14:9. Again, he wrote: \"See! the king, my lord, has set his name at the rising of the sun and at the setting of the sun,\" a parallel to which may be found inMalachil:!!. These and similar parallels moved the scholar who brought them together to write: \"The repeated lyrical utterances of Rib-Addi and Abdi-Khiba are early examples of the unrestrained laments of the later Israelites who appeal, not to a divine king of Egypt, their overlord, but to Yahweh.\"' 1 By establishing this, the author hit on only half the truth. He emphasized the similarity of the expressions and he was right; but, compelled by the conventional clironology, he regarded this fact as proof that the Canaanites, seven or eight hun- dred years before the Israelite prophets and scribes, had used the same peculiar expressions and he was wrong. The assumed heritage of the Canaanite culture in art and litera- ture was actually an Israelite creation. The proofs of the continuity of culture in Palestine (before and after tihe conquest by the Israelites) are vanishing. To this list of comparisons, taken from the research of another, may be added all those expressions that we have found to be identi- cal in the letters and in the dialogues and monologues of the Books of Kings and Chronicles in the chapters dealing with the period of Ahab and Jehoshaphat, and which we compared earlier in these Letter 137. *S.

It is easy to expand this collection, for there is not a monologue or dialogue in the pertinent chapters of Kings and Chronicles that does not have turns of speech which are also in the el-Amarna letters.

Jezebel sent letters to the elders of Jezreel inviting them to bring false witness against Naboth. Ben-Hadad sent a letter to the king of Israel asking him to heal Naaman. Jehu, after the success of the conspiracy in Jezreel, twice sent letters to the elders of Samaria. The el-Amarna letters provide us with ample evidence that em- ployment of scribes and the writing of letters was rather common in the Palestine of that time. They prove also that in the Palestine of Ahab and Jehoshaphat scribes read and wrote cuneiform in addi- tion to Hebrew. This confirms the theory advanced at the beginning of this century 8 that cuneiform was being written in Palestine at ''\"The dog\" means also a male prostitute. Cf. Deuteronomy 23:18. The expression, \"Is thy servant a dog that he shall not ...\" is also found in letters of Lachish, the modem Tell ed Duweir, in southern Palatine.

Ivory frag- ments inscribed with Hebrew letters bear witness to this conclusion: a comparison of these letters with the characters of the Mesha in- scription showed that they originated at one and the same time. 5 The excavators felt justified in writing: \"No other finds have told us so much about the art of the Israelite monarchy.\" On some of those objects there are Egyptian designs, and the Egyptian double crown, clearly cut, was found on several of the plates. 7 A student of the Bible would expect to find Assyrian motifs because of Assyrian domination in the north of Syria in the ninth century before this era, not a predominance of Egyptian influence in art at a time when, according to his table of chronology, arts were not cherished in the Egypt of the ignoble successors of Shoshenk (Sosenk) of the Twenty-second Dynasty, long after the brilliant Eighteenth Dynasty. The excavators of Samaria were surprised: \"It is significant that in our ivories there is no sign of Assyrian influ- ence,\" and \"the influence of Egypt on the other hand is all-per- vasive.\" 8 There arc plaques which represent Egyptian gods; the subjects on furniture \"are all Egyptian.\" 8 By synchronizing the time of Akhnaton with that of Ahab, we realize that the part Egypt played in Samaria in the days of the el- Amama letters makes the presence of Egyptian motifs and furniture styles in the ivory of Samaria very understandable. We are even in a position to compare the ivory finds in Samaria with those in Egypt at the time of Akhnaton* \"Winged figures in human form\" were found in Samaria. \"The forms of winged figures on the ivories . . . are derived from Egyptian models* Tutelary goddesses of this type stand at the four corners of the shrine of Tutenkhamun.\" 10 Three winged sphinxes with human heads were also found in Samaria, *E.

The excavators of Samaria's ivories, observing the style of the ornaments, recognize the influence of Egyptian art but think that in the days of Ahab a restoration of ancient forms in art took place, the \"Egypt of yesterday\" having been revived in Samaria after six hun- dred years. In the same ornaments of Samarian ivory could be recognized motifs of the type described in the Scriptures, such as palm trees \"between a cherub and a cherub\" (Ezekiel 41:18). \"Some of the figures [of the ivories of Samaria] . . . were like those which were carved on the House of the Lord in Jerusalem/* 12 The conclusion arrived at was that the style of the ornaments in the Temple at Jeru- salem represented an intermediate stage in the succession of influ- ences. \"The type goes back to the Egyptian art of the Eighteenth Dynasty.\" 18 The* place of origin of the style Egypt or Palestine can be dis- puted. Probably a reciprocal influence was the inspiration for the motifs on the ornaments. One fact, however, reverses all conclusions in the study of the comparative art of Egypt-Palestine: the Eight- eenth Dynasty ruled from the days of Saul until Jehu, and the great temples of Luxor and Kamak, creations of Thutmose III and Amen- hotep III, were built not before but after the Temple in Jerusalem was erected. In the time of Solomon ivory was imported from distant countries, along with silver, apes, and peacocks. From Palestine it was ex- ported to Egypt, and Hatshepsut brought ivory with her as the bas- reliefs of the Punt expedition show and the texts accompanying the bas-reliefs tell.

The pharaoh brought from Jerusalem \"the great throne of ivory, overlaid with pure gold\" this according to the Hebrew sources (II Chroni- cles 9:17; 12:9). In the eighth campaign Thutmose III took tribute including \"vessels laden with ivory/' In the records of the tribute he received in Punt, God's Land, or Rezenu (Palestine) there is fre- quent mention of ivory in tusks (thus, eighteen tusks from the chiefs of Rezenu in the sixteenth collection of tribute) and in furniture (tables of ivory in the thirteenth collection of tribute). After en- larging his fleet with the fleet of the Phoenicians, he sent his ships to collect tribute and, like Hatshepsut before him, used the maritime route for transport of ivory from Palestine to Egypt The art of working in ivory was transferred at that time to Egypt. In the tomb of Rekhmire, a vizier of Thutmose III, workers from Palestine are portrayed \"making chests of ivory\" these were im- ported craftsmen. Samaria, built a few decades later, became a manufacturing center of ivory, working mainly for Egypt. Among the ivories exca- vated in Samaria there are many unfinished pieces with Egyptian patterns. Color effects wore produced by staining the ivory with pigments. 14 Colored ivory was also found in the tomb of Tutankhamen. In an el-Amarna letter of Burraburiash we read about colored ivory. The tablets of el-Amarna mention furniture and various objects of ivory delivered to Asia Minor, Cyprus, Assyria, and other coun- tries of western Asia. Objects similar to those found in Samaria were discovered in these lands. In the last century inlaid plaques with Egyptian subjects were found in Mesopotamia. When the ivories of Samaria were unearthed they were acclaimed as closely related to those found previously in the palace of Nimrud and in other places: ivories which \"may have come from the same workshop as the Samaria ivories, were found by Layard in the northwest palace at Nimrud; a few stray examples come from other sites.\" 15 \"Homer, in the Iliad, IV, 141-42, mentions the Carton woman who stains ivory red.

Though the ivories of Samaria and Megiddo show the same patterns and the same workmanship, they were ascribed to two different periods. 10 Similarly, other discoveries of ivory were attributed by their finders either to the period of the Eighteenth Dynasty (the fifteenth and fourteenth centuries) or to the period of the kings of Samaria (the ninth and eighth centuries). 17 The second period is thought to have been the age of imitation of old Egyptian styles and of the renais- sance of the old craft. They were but one and the same period, and the ivories of the Samaria of Ahab and of the Thebes of Tutankhamen are products of one and the same golden age of ivory art. Conclusions If one is determined to keep to the traditional construction of history and insist that the letters of el-Amarna were written to and from archaic Canaanite princes, he is also bound to maintain that in Canaan events occurred which recurred half a millennium later in the time of Jehoshaphat and Ahab. This makes it necessary to hold that there already was a city of Sumur, of which not a relic remained; that this city, with a royal palace and fortified walls, was repeatedly besieged by a king of Damascus, who had a prolonged dispute and recurrent wars with the king of Sumur over a number of cities, in a conflict that endured for a number of decades; that on one occasion the king of Sumur captured the king of Damascus but released him; that on the occasion of a siege of Sumur by 6ie king of Damascus the guard attached to the governors succeeded in driving away the Syrian host from the walls of Sumur; that on the occasion of another siege of Sumur the Syrian host, hearing rumors of the arrival of the Egyptian archers, left their camp and fled every detail \"See G.

The traditional construction of history implies also that the king of Damascus, who was at the head of a coalition of many Arabian chieftains, succeeded in fomenting a revolt by a Trans-Jordan king named Mesh against the king of Sumur, whose vassal he was, and this rebellious vassal king captured cities of the king of Sumur and humiliated his people, as in the days of Mesha's rebellion against the king of Samaria. That Rimuta was the place in dispute between the king of Damascus and the king of Sumur, as Ramoth was in the second epoch; that the king of Sumur had a second residence where a deity was worshiped whoso name, Baalith, was the same as that of the deity introduced by Jezebel, and the king of Sumur planted groves in his second residence, like Ahab in the field of Naboth; that the king of Damascus organized a number of ambuscades against the king of Sumur, and the king of Sumur each time managed to escape death, like the king of Samaria of the second period; that the king of Damascus became gravely ill, yet did not die from the illness but was put to a violent death on his sickbed, like the king of Damascus of the second period. This hypothetical scholar would also be bound to admit that all these coincidences happened at a time when the land of Sumur was visited by a drought, and the springs dried up and a severe famine followed; that the drought lasted several years and caused starvation of the people and epidemics among the domestic animals; and that the inhabitants departed from the realm of the two residences everything just as it happened in the second period. lie would have to maintain that the two periods do not differ in any respect whatsoever, and that each event of one period has its twin in the other.

This scholar would also have to admit that the military chiefs of the Canaanite king of Jerusalem signed their letters with the same names as the military chiefs of Jehoshaphat, king of Jerusalem, and that the names were as peculiar and unusual as, for example, lahzi- bada ( Jehozabad) and \"son of Zuchru\" (\"son of ZichrT), or Addaia (Adaia), or Adadanu (Adadani, Adna), who was again the first among the chiefs; that the governor of Sumur had the same name as the governor of Samaria of the later period ( Amon), and that the keeper of the palace in Sumur was named Arzaia like the chief steward, Arza, of the king of Israel. Again, in the city of Shunem (Shunama) lived a \"great lady/' and already in the first period some miracle had happened to her so that she was called Baalat-Nese. And again, the king of Damascus had a military governor (Naa- man, lanhama), by whose hand \"deliverance was given to Syria,\" and who at first was feared by the king of Sumur but later on be- came the latter's friend, like his reincarnation six hundred years later. Further, the successor of the murdered king of Damascus, by the name of Aziru or Azaru, acted like Hazael of the second period: he oppressed the land of Sumur; he conquered almost all the land of the realm; he burned with fire the strongholds and villages of the king of Sumur; he even spoke with the same peculiar expres- sions as Hazael did later on. This scholar would also be faced with the fact that in the second period the city of Irqata again lost her king, and that King Matinu- Bali and King Adunu-Bali, under the leadership of Biridri, defied the mighty invader from the north, just as happened in the first period when a Biridia (Biridi) assumed the task of leading the kinglcss city of Irqata and King Mut-Balu and King Aduna against the in- vader from the north.

Again, the king of Damascus, Hazael, battled with him between Lebanon and Hermon as did Azaru of the first period. Again, the kings of Tyre and Sidon, harassed by this invader, left their cities and departed in ships, as they did six hundred years earlier. In both periods the art of ivory work flourished, and identical patterns were produced: designs and execution, characteristic of the earlier period, were repeated in the second period, and have been found to be so similar that they have been taken for copies of the art objects of the first period. In both periods the same architecture and stone workmanship (Megiddo, Samaria) found expression. In both periods the same idiomatic Hebrew was spoken. Can one accept such a series of coincidences? And if it is ac- cepted, is it only to have the old difficulties present themselves again? If the Habirti were the Israelites, why,^then, in the Book of Joshua, which records the conquest of Canaan, and in the letters of el-Amarna are no common name and no common event preserved? A Halfway Mark At the beginning of this work I placed before the reader the unsolved problem of the correlation of Israelite and Egyptian his- tories. Of these two ancient nations, one professes to have had close tics with the other; actually the biblical story moves in the light and shadow of the great kingdom on the Nile. Egyptian his- tory, on the other hand, in all its numerous inscriptions, on stone and on papyrus, denies any real contact with the neighboring king- dom on the Jordan- Even the glorious age of King Solomon, so exalted in the Old Testament, appears to have passed entirely un- noticed by the Egyptian kings and their scribes. And more than that, the great events of the Israelite past their long bondage in Egypt and their departure from that land tinder unusual circumstances- appear to have been entirely unknown to the conventional history of Egypt, For that reason the time of the Exodus is debated and placed at almost every conceivable time point of the Egyptian past,"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"336 AGES IN CHAOS from the beginning of the New Kingdom presumably in 1580 down many centuries. The uncertainty as to the time of the sojourn in Egypt and the departure is the direct result of the absence of refer- ences to the children of Israel in Egypt and to their leaving the country, and of the sterility of information concerning the relations as neighbors of these two peoples during the period covered by the Scriptures. We have attempted to solve the problem of the synchronization of the histories of these two peoples of antiquity, both of whom occupy major places in the history of the ancient world. We made this attempt after we recognized that the biblical story of the Exo- dus contains frequently repeated references to some natural catas- trophes. Logic thus required us to look in extant Egyptian sources for references to some disturbance in nature. The search proved not to be fruitless. The Leiden Papyrus Ipuwer is a record of some natural catastrophe followed by a social up- heaval; in the description of the catastrophe we recognized many details of the disturbances that accompanied the Exodus as nar- rated in the Scriptures. The inscription on the shrine from el-Arish contains another version of the cataclysm accompanied by a htJrri- cane and nine days' darkness; and there we found also a descrip- tion of the march of the pharaoh and his army toward the eastern frontier of his kingdom, where he was engulfed in a whirlpool. The name of the pharaoh is given in a royal cartouche which proves that the text was not regarded by its writer as mythical. If we have in these documents the same story as found in the Book of Exodus, then a synchronical point between the histories of these two ancient nations is established. But here, where we ex- pected to reach the solution of the problem of the date of the Exo- dus in Egyptian history, we were confronted with a problem that made the question of the date of the Exodus shrink into insignifi- cance. Whatever theories have been offered concerning the time of the Exodus, not once has the thought occurred that the Israelites left Egypt on the eve of the arrival of the Hyksos. Consequently we found ourselves faced with a problem of very different magnitude. Either Egyptian history is much too long or biblical history is much too short. Must Egyptian history be shortened by some \"ghost\" cen-"},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"THE EL-AMARNA LETTERS (CONCLUDED) 337 turies, or biblical history lengthened by the same number of \"lost\" centuries? We could not know the answer to this problem until we traveled a long distance through the centuries of ancient history. We noticed a path on which to start this journey. If the Israelites left Egypt on the eve of its invasion by the Hyksos, who arrived from Asia, we might, perchance, find in the Scriptures a reference to a meeting outside the borders of Egypt of the children of Israel and the in- vaders. Actually, even before they reached Mount Sinai, the Israel- ites encountered the hordes of Amaleldtes. We turned to the old Arabian writers and found that the tradition of the Amaleldtes as the dominant tribe among the Arabs, who invaded Egypt and ruled it for four or five hundred years, is alive in the Arabian literary heritage from their early past. As we compared point after point in the Egyptian hieroglyphic, Hebrew biblical and post-biblical sources, and Arab autochthonous traditions found in their medieval writings, we were forced to con- clude that the time of the Hyksos domination of Egypt was the time of the Judges in scriptural history. The equation of Hyksos and Amalekites gave additional support to the synchronization of the fall of the Middle Kingdom and the Exodus. We then had to examine the historical moment of the collapse of Hyksos rule in Egypt and the end of Amalckitc domination in the Near East. In the siege of Auaris, the Ilyksos fortress, by Ahmosc, some foreign troops played a decisive role. From parallels in the Book of Samuel it could be determined that it was King Saul, the first Jewish king, who was victorious over the Amalekites at el-Arish; and with the help of many proofs we could establish that el-Arish occupies the position of the ancient Auaris. David was a contemporary of Ahmose, founder of the Eighteenth Dynasty, and of Amenhotep I; Solomon was a contemporary of Thutmosc I und Ilatshepsut* And we found that the celebrated journey to God\\s Land and Punt was the voyage to Palestine and Phoenicia described in the Scriptures as the visit of the Queen of Sheba. We compared many details and always found that they coincided. But this drove us to the next station on the road* Five years after"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"338 AGES IN CHAOS Solomon's death the Temple of Jerusalem and its palace were sacked by a pharaoh. Thutmose III succeeded Hatshepsut If we were traveling on the right road, again we had to find a correspond- ence here: Thutmose III must have sacked Jerusalem of the treas- ures of its palace and Temple. This he actually did, and the pictures of his booty correspond very closely, in shape and number, with the description of the loot taken by a pharaoh in the fifth year after Solomon's death. Under the next pharaoh Palestine was invaded again, according to scriptural and Egyptian sources. This time, however, the expedi- tion was far from being victorious. For three generations biblical scholars proved to the full satisfac- tion of all that many parts of the Scriptures were products of much later centuries than the Scriptures would indicate. Then, during the 1930s, with the discovery of the Ras Shamra texts, the estimate was revised in the diametrically opposite direction: the same biblical texts were now regarded as a heritage of Canaanite culture, six cen- turies older than the biblical texts. However, the collation of mate- rial from Hebrew literary sources, from Ras Shamra, and from Egypt convinced us that not only the earlier reduction of the age of biblical prose and verse but also its present increase is erroneous. In saying this we are actually ahead of what we may legitimately assert: we still do not know which of the two histories, Egyptian or Israelite, must be readjusted. At the same time we observed how the histories of other ancient countries and peoples accord with either the Israelite or the Egyptian chronology; and how the histories of Cyprus, Mycenae, and Crete, in correlating with one side or the other, create confusion in archaeology and chronology. In three consecutive chapters we collated the historical evidence of three successive generations in Egypt (Hatshepsut, Thutmose III, Amenhotep II) and in Palestine (Solomon, Rehoboam, Asa), and found unfailing correspondence. It is possible that by sheer accident one age in Egypt bears a close resemblance to another ago, and thus offers ground for a spurious coevality; but it is quite im- possible that three consecutive generations in Egypt and in the neighboring Palestine of two different ages could produce con- sistent correspondence in so many details. What is even more"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"THE EL-AMARNA LETTERS (CONCLUDED) 339 striking, these three consecutive generations in Egypt as well as in Palestine were not selected at random, but were forced upon us by the deliberations and parallels of the earlier chapters, in which we scrutinized the time of the Exodus and the following centuries until Saul, and in Egypt the last days of the Middle Kingdom and the following centuries of Hyksos rule until the rise of the New King- dom. It would be a miracle, indeed, if all these coincidences were purely accidental. Anyone familiar with the theory of probabilities knows that with every additional coincidence the chances for an- other grow smaller, not in arithmetical or in geometric progression, but in a progression of a higher order; therefore the chance would be a trillion or quadrillion against one that all the parallels offered on previous pages are merely coincidences. Following the tlirec consecutive generations in Egypt and Pales- tine, there were Amenhotcp III and Akhnaton in Egypt and Jehosh- aphat in Judca and Ahab in Israel. It could not be by mere chance that the fourth generation again presented a picture in which the details fit together like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. The histories of two lands and the vicissitudes in the lives of their rulers and their peoples could not be in complete correspondence were there not exact synchronism. And so it happened that in this fourth genera- tion the rulers and prominent personages in one country actually wrote letters to the rulers and prominent personages in the other country and received written answers from them. To what extent details and events correspond during those years of famine, sieges, invasion from Trans-Jordan, and military pressure from the north has been recounted at length. And this sequence of invariable cor- relation and conformity gives us a feeling of security that we are not on the wrong path. However, we are not yet at the end of the journey. Notwithstand- ing all that has been said up to now concerning the numerous paral- lels, collations, coincidences, and conformities, as well as the theory of probabilities, we cannot regard the problem of ancient history as solved until wo have covered the full distance to the point where the histories of the peoples of the ancient East no longer present a problem of synchronization."},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"340 AGES IN CHAOS We have before us the eighth and the following centuries, accord- ing to Israelite history.

A campaign was carried on to create the im- pression that the press of this country had rejected the book. Here are a few comments from favorable reviews about this work, the most controversial volume in many decades: N. Y. HERALD TRIBUNE, John J. O'Neill: Dr. Immanuel Velikovsky has assembled into a monumental work evidence from all the early civilizations that in the first and second millennium B. G. tremendous terrestrial cataclysms took place. In a magnificent piece of scholarly his- torical research, there unfolds a most exciting picture of terrestrial events that raises world history to a level of superlative interest. Obscure allu- sions to events in classical and sacred literature become crystal clear as he fits together the jigsaw puzzle of his- tory* Dr. Vclikovsky's work presents a stupendous panorama of terrestrial and human histories which will stand as a challenge to scientists to frame a realistic picture of the cosmos. HARPER'S MAGAZINE, Eric Lar- rabee: Philosophy, science, religion there is scarcely an area of knowl- edge or conviction invulnerable to Dr. Vclikovsky's detailed and docu- mented denial that the Earth's his- tory hft been one of peaceful evolution . * . Bringing to this per- spective all the apparatus of learn- ing, Dr. Velikovsky has undertaken the awesome task of making an \"in- quiry into the architectonics of the world and its history\" and of apply- ing the techniques of scholarship and psychoanalysis to the entire hu- man race. READER.'S DIGEST, Fulton Ours- ler: A single scholar has sought a synthesis of knowledge and reason in the field of science, legend and religion. The result is a theory of earth's history as a planet, fascinat- ing as a tale by Jules Verne, yet documented with a scholarship worthy of Darwin. COLLIER'S, Editor: \"Worlds in Collision\" promises to be one of the most controversial books of the year, perhaps of the decade . Tre- mendous volume of research amassed by the author over a period of ten years. Although the theories Dr. Velikovsky expresses are certain to provoke debate, prominent scientific"},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"and religious leaders have found them most extraordinary. NEWSWEEK: Velikovsky, a broad- gauge savant with an incredible field of competence in the sciences . . . confirms the Bible . . . His final con- clusions are even world-shaking . . * If Velikovsky's monumental work stands, it will upset prevailing views in evolution, physical science and history. NEWSWEEK, \"Professors as Sup- pressors\": Although some of the critics who reviewed Velikovsky's book considered it a major scientific contribution, there could be little question but that it had driven the vast majority of the nation's scien- tists into a highly unacademic fury. For Velikovsky challenges all the present concepts and laws of history, astronomy, biology, and geology. One of the most cherished rights of the nation's teaching profession is academic freedom. . . . Yet a small group of professors themselves stood accused of a major assault on aca- demic freedom. PAGEANT: Nothing in recent years has so excited the public imagina- tion, or stirred up so heated a con- troversy, as the fascinating new theory advanced by Dr. Immanucl Velikovsky, physician, scientist, his- torian, philosopher. Its inferences past and future, are so great and far reaching as to make the hydro- gen bomb and 1950 troubles seem like child's play. ASSOCIATED PRESS, Robert W. Blakeslee, Science Editor: The book upsets all cosmological assumptions that the solar system planets have revolved in their present orbits for billions of years. UNITED PRESS, Paul F. Ellis, Science Editor: \"Worlds in Colli- sion\" caused a commotion among astronomers but Velikovsky said: \"Let them disprove the historical records on which my book is based.\" NEW REPUBLIC, Harold L. Ickes: Dr. Velikovsky has conferred a great boon upon all of us. He has given us something to think about; some- thing even to pray about . . . Per- haps we shall have sense enough to put our heads between our hands and do some real thinking about universal and lasting peace. BOOK-OF-THE-MONTH CLUB NEWS, John J. O'Neill: Tf you want an intellectual jolt read \"Worlds in Collision\" by Dr. Immanuel Veli- kovsky. It will furnish your mind with a new set of horizons. For here is a volume filled with events, stu- pendous, cataclysmic terrestrial and cosmic . . . This is not just a wonder book. It is a serious presentation by a sincere scholar, and there is a deep philosophic significance underlying\" it. Dr. Velikovsky provides an array' of evidence to support his claims. Scholars may disagree with Dr. Velikovsky 's conclusions. To minds blinded by too much orthodoxy they may seem fantastic. They are, never- theless, worthy of most serious; thought. Science and history have been standing pat for entirely too long on a theory of man and naiure that excludes the possibility of events outside a dull, safe routine. They have achieved this static program by hanging velvet curtains of taboo around embarrassing situations. They are ripe for a jolt* Dr. Velikovsky has pulled some of the curtains aside.

THIS WEEK MAGAZINE, Gordon A. Atwater: Even before the book's publication it has been the subject of a storm of controversy that has swept across the nation ... I do contend that, looking at it from an over-all point of view, the author has done a tremendous job, the effect of which is to link science and religion. His book will have an explosive effect in the world of science. The greatest value of \"Worlds in Collision\" is this: It sots up an unusual approach to some of the world's great prob- lems. An astounding feat of research ... an amazing list of sources. In assembling those proofs Dr. Vclikov- sky has plunged headlong into a dozen difToront sciences and has dug deeply itito the roots of many. Dr. Velikovsky, realizing the impact of his thesis, has gone to very great lengths to reveal his method so that it may be searched in detail * . . Although the opening impact of this theory due to its sensational nature is certain to arouse violent hos- tility, even this feeling will be set aside as it is searched and probed for errors and truths. SATURDAY EVENING POST, Editorial: One of the most astonish- ing episodes was the effort of Ameri- can scientists to suppress a book, Worlds in Collision. . . . Doctor Vclikovsky's offense seems to be that he writes bettor than most scientists and m his book expounds a theory of astronomical activity which dif- fers widely from orthodox theories. ... So the orthodox scientists, for- getting about Galileo, and the long, woeful struggle of scientists to be free of dogma, acted like the author- itarians with whom they are con- tinually in conflict, . . Not even a silly season ought to excuse scien- tists for book burning. After all, they are always the chief victims of this kind of intolerance. PATHFINDER: Top-flight scientists think \"Worlds in Collision\" will force reconsideration of the basic postulates of many major sciences. AMERICAN MERCURY: The cen- tral thesis of this book is stupendous. Dr. Velikovsky, who seems to be a veritable cyclopedia of learning, draws upon all the sciences and arts to buttress his thesis. N. Y. SUNDAY MIRROR MAGA- ZINE, H. William Smith: \"Worlds in Collision\" presents arguments to prove that famous colossal miracles of ancient times, as related in folk- lore and religious literature, actually happened. As Velikovsky sees it, our apparently well-ordered universe is like a fireworks factory which an erratic spark may explode any min- ute. The promulgation of this thesis is expected to excite heated objec- tions in the scientific world, but Velikovsky makes a very plausible case* N. Y. SUNDAY NEWS, Editorial: \"Worlds in Collision\" is raising such a terrific furor in scientific cir- cles that we don't see how a news- paper which claims to be on its toes can ignore the book or dodge from frank discussion of it. Dr. Vclikov- sky, a widely-travelled scholar and scientific investigator, oilers a flock of theories which make orthodox scientists foam at the mouth. [He] challenges them to prove him mis- taken. If we might presume to offer the scientific brotherhood a tip, it would be to get busy trying to dis- prove Velikovsky with facts and fig-"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"ures, and lay off trying to promote boycotts aimed at his book. N. Y. JOURNAL & AMERICAN, George E. Sokolsky: Certain scien- tists threatened with a boycott. Of course, what the learned and liberal professors wanted was the total sup- pression of a book which opposes their dogma. Scientists tend to be- come dogmatic like theologians, whom they denounce as dogmatic. N. Y. SUNDAY COMPASS, Ted. O. Thackrey: There is excellent ground for suggesting that Dr. Velikovsky's findings thus far may well rank him in contemporary and future history with Galileo, Newton, Planck, Kep- ler, Darwin, Einstein, and the other great intellects who have in turn bade us revise our theories of what the world is like and what laws gov- ern it and its relation to the uni- verse. BOSTON GLOBE, Marion L. Star- key: Probably the most stimulating horror story that has ever been writ- ten. There is something of poetry, of divine justice about the theory. BOSTON POST, A.GJL Dietz (Pro- fessor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology): Velikovsky proposed a bold and startling thesis . . . and results in a book that is absorbing reading ... It seems certain that there must at one time have been a sudden shifting of the Earth's axis. BOSTON POST, Lester Allen: Only a generation of time and re-exami- nation of the evidence presented by Velikovsky will show whether he is merely a brilliant improviser or a profound discoverer of a new prin- ciple. The challenge that Velikovsky presents to modern science may ac- complish something more for the troubled and frightened people of the world than putting their scien- tific house in order, however. It may give a death blow to the growing skepticism of many people whose faith in the Divine Creator had been shaken in the name of scientific en- lightenment by the debunkers of the holy books. N. Y. TIMES BOOK REVIEW, David Dempsey: Among general non-fiction, \"Worlds in Collision\" was being outsold by only one book the Bible. The epicenter of a liter- ary earthquake. PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER: John M. McCullough: Few books have so stirred the world of thought- ful men; the arguments pro and con inevitably must reverberate through learned societies for months to come. It is this its role as a potent fer- ment in a world of not too settled thought which imbues \"Worlds in Collision\" with its real significance. PITTSBURGH PRESS, Florence Fisher Perry: It is moro fascinating reading than anything to be found on any fiction table. It is absolutely original and convincing. CHICAGO HERALD-AMERICAN: A fabulous story , . . This book is revolutionary and may prove almost as world-shaking as if Venus had changed her settings again. It is writ- ten so that any one can understand. CHICAGO SUN-TIMES, Emmett Dedmon: \"Worlds in Collision\" is clearly written and well-enough but- tressed with data to startle any reader into a re-examination of his ideas about the world. And I expect it may provoke one of the biggest arguments since Einstein said the"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"shortest distance between two points was a curved line. THE CRESSET, Chicago, 111., Er- \\vin J. Buls: Seldom has one theory extended into so many fields of hu- man thought and drawn on so many for its evidence . . . \"Worlds in Collision\" presents such an array of evidence that it cannot be ignored, while the high degree of scholarship evident throughout the book does not permit derisive dismissal. Writ- ten in non-technical language, lay- man and scientist will find it fas- cinating. BALTIMORE EVENING SUN: Velikovsky has built a powerful case for the contention that those ac- counts reflect occurrences which did actually take place . . And science does not yet have any way of its own to explain these \"Miracles.\" CLEVELAND PRESS, Tom Board- man: It's a book that will be dis- cussed, studied, challenged and de- fended for many years. DALLAS TIMES-HERALD, Ken- neth Koran: Startling, astounding, amazing and entirely revolutionary story of the universe. SAN ANTONIO EXPRESS, Henry H, Lawrence: A book of absorbing interest and one bound to excite dis- cussion and further elucidation for years to come. PORTLAND JOURNAL, Larry Howes: It can be understood and argued about by laymen, and It blacks the eye of Dogmatic Science* PORTLAND OREGONIAN: A high percentage of those whose fields are invaded and their facts questioned may be expected to rise to the chal- lenge. The minds that will be stimu- lated by this book are the world's best. Who knows what may come of that? PORTLAND (Me.) TELEGRAM, K. W. Berry: If the theory set forth by Velikovsky stands the acid test to which it undoubtedly will be sub- jected, it will upset the foundation of the world's natural sciences and contravene theological claims for many miracles described in the Old Testament . * . His countless cita- tions build up a strong case a case which scarcely seems to depend on coincidence. DAYTON NEWS, Herbert Shaw: Surely Immanucl Velikovsky has written so controversial a book that it will be the subject of much de- bate and much diligent intellectual searching in the years to come. He is to be admired and congratulated for the documentation he has presented. DENVER POST, Edward V. Dund- Ice: \"Worlds in Collision\" is easily the most discussed book of the year, deals with the truth or falsity of these ancient biblical stories. Read this book with an open mind and a new vista of ideas will be opened. MIAMI HERALD, Beatrice Wash- bum: This book has literally shaken the thinking world to its foundations, Not since Darwin's \"Origin of the Species\" has there been advanced an idea so original, controversial, and stupendous in its implications. MONTGOMERY, Alabama, AD- VERTISER, W. J, Mahoney, Jr.: You are likely to hear it debated furiously . . .

It is a book that will supply many an evening of spirited conversation for the draw- ing rooms of the world. LOUISVILLE, Kentucky, COUR- IER-JOURNAL, Joseph Landau: Velikovsky has hurled his interpre- tation of biblical events and world history into a world that is in chaos. It could be a book that will affect the thinking of the ages. \"Worlds in Collision\" could easily become one of the most important books of the soth century. RALEIGH NEWS OBSERVER, Allen Alexander: Once in a great while you may be fortunate enough to come across a truly amazing book. This is far more than that it may well become a bible. His descrip- tions will make your spine tingle as it never has before. Actually, this book is as easy to read as a western and much more exciting. TENNESSEEAN, Nashville, Tenn., Charles L. Fontenay: The term \"revolutionary\" is all too frequently applied to books in these days when a couple of months seems to be the maximum accepted period between new theories of various kinds. The term, however, could fit Dr. Veil- kovsky*s book, BERKELEY GAZETTE, California: The book has aroused speculation and controversies throughout the country ... If Dr. Velikovsky is right, there will be many red faces among the reviewers of the land. OAKLAND POST ENQUIRER: It is difficult to laugh away the paral- lels of legend and tradition . . . you encounter some vast panoramas that are most stimulating to thought PROVIDENCE JOURNAL, Ken- neth B. Roberts: An incredibly sim- ple solution of scores of baffling problems of antiquity . . . But right or wrong, rational or ridiculous, this is fascinating fare. ROCKY MOUNTAIN NEWS, Den- ver, CoL, Lee Casey: One of the most amazing and persuasive books I have ever read: \"Worlds in Colli- sion,\" by Velikovsky. He sweeps away the cxegetcs. The stories we learned in Sunday School, he tells us, were not mere legends but straight facts. To be sure, he did not con- vince his fellow-scholars. Neither, for that matter, did Pythagoras, Thales, Galileo or Copernicus. Now, as in the time of these worthies, scholars merely smiled and said, \"The case had not been proved,\" But I do submit he convinced me. ROCKY MOUNTAIN NEWS, A. Branscombe: This is, without any doubt, the most sensational book of the soth century. If the facts in it stand up under cold analysis by other scientists, and this reviewer be- lieves 90 per cent of them will, al- most every other scientific and his- torical textbook in the world is out- dated . . . No book since Darwin promises to have such an impact on every phase of science^ history, philosophy and religion . . * Dr, Velikovsky's claims . * . are told in language simple enough for virtu- ally any reader, and will prove fas- cinating for layman and scientist alike ... In short, this is extraordi- nary. Don't miss it. LOS ANGELES TIMES, Maximil- ian Berners: Controversy wilt be- come more and more violent as the book gctn known, There is plenty of excitement, following Velikov- sky's trail of fire, smoke, brim* stone, hurricane and earthquake."},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"FREDERICK, Oklahoma, LEADER: A volume of endless fascination. CONGRESS WEEKLY, Jacob S. Minkin: Many threads the author has woven into the tremendous tap- estry that is \"Worlds in Collision.\" The story goes on, interesting, in- structive and exciting to the end. In many ways the book is breathtaking, moving along like a celestial drama with comets and planets for its dramatis pcisonae. THE NATIONAL JEWISH POST, Ward Moore: Scientists are no more receptive to new ideas than any other group subscribing to crystal- lized dogma. It is therefore not at all surprising that Immanuel Veli- kovsky has been denounced as a heretic. \"Worlds in Collision\" ques- tioned the infallibility of some ap- parently natural laws. A tremendous amount of t orritory is taken in; nevertheless, documentation is of- fered for each particular. Unless reader's prejudices arc completely blind it is difficult to see how he can dismiss \"Worlds in Collision.'* OKLAHOMA CITY OKLAHO- MAN, Alice Hughes: Dinner tables in our war-jittery town are agog with this eerie volume* DETROIT NEWS, Clyde Beck: A strange and wonderful book. EVENING DISPATCH, Edinburgh, Scotland: No lx>ok in rece.nt times has boon the subject of so much controversy. Soim*. scientists let loose a flood of tlenuwiaiory criticism and hysterical protests against the publi- cation. . . . What we liave iu this piece of cholarly research h the history of the earth as a planet, fas- cinatingly told and truthfully docu- mented OXFORD MAIL, Oxford, England: Fascinating alike in its stupendous pictures of a world in the grip of cosmic forces, in its parallels drawn from the annals of the ancients in many lands, and its vast implica- tions. THE TIMES, London: Dr. Veli- kovsky is a man of much learning and he has mastered the commen- taries upon the text and all books on cosmology as well. . . . [The book's] reputation has been . . . en- hanced by dark stories of scientists allegedly applying pressure by boy- cotting the text book department of the author's first publishing house in a frenzied effort to prevent the de- struction of their own reputation and of orthodox physics. GLASGOW DAILY RECORD, Glasgow, Scotland: Gigantic, sensa- tional, staggering. METHODIST RECORDER, Lon- don, England: A thriller that is surely without a peer. JEWISH CHRONICLE, London, Dr. Silverstone: For one scholar to have written this book, necessitating as it docs an encyclopedic knowl- edge of science, history, and folk- lore, is a remarkable achievement. It merits close study on the part of scientists; and it will reward the ordinary reader with fascinating hours of menial enjoyment. EDINBURGH EVENING NEWS: The strength of his evidence is great* It is a truly wonderful book. ABERDEEN PRESS, Aberdeen, Scotland: Probably no book in our generation has caused so much con- troversy. . * , In the scientific world it caused a veritable explo- sion of bad temper."},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"COMMERCIAL APPEAL, Mem- phis: \"Worlds in Collision\" has opened new debate in science. Ef- forts have been made to dismiss this work by calling it \"rubbish\" and \"nonsense\" but this will not answer the evidence he has compiled. It is a foregone conclusion that the book will call for renewed investigation from others of the facts so long ac- cepted. If it does no more, the au- thor has rendered a noble service to his profession and to his fellow men. TORONTO SATURDAY NIGHT, Editorial: The American scientific world has gone through a cataclysm almost as violent as those referred to by Dr. Velikovsky. CHRISTIAN CENTURY, W. E. Garrison: The book is exciting read- ing. The two Wellses (H.G. and Orson) might have collaborated to conceive it. CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONI- TOR, Boston: This verification of the Bible seems to us of real impor- tance. It shows what are sometimes called \"miracles\" to be not viola- tions of law but higher demonstra- tions of spiritual law than the ma- terialist deems possible. CHRISTIAN HERALD: The vol- ume is both daring and original and perhaps reckless. But also it is fascinating. THE LIVING CHURCH, Milwau- kee, Editorial: If you are worried about Russia or the hydrogen bomb, read \"Worlds in Collision.\" The cataclysms therein described make even the horrors foreshadowed in the daily papers fade. This work is heavily documented and ranges over an amazing variety of fields of learn- ing. PRESBYTERIAN, Philadelphia: The greatest storm center in the literary and scientific worlds. CHRISTIAN REGISTER, Boston: Dr. Velikovsky has done us a very great service: he has jarred the complacency of our thinking; he has emphasized the importance of un- derstanding and grasping the sig- nificance of early tradition, and has stressed again the limitations of human knowledge. All of these are important in our generation. PITTSBURGH COURIER, H. G. Bell: Incredible genius. Contro- versial and ahiazing book; all will admit that his ideas are thought pro- voking. AUGUSTA CHRONICLE, Ga,: As- tonishing in many lines. It may be the beginning of understanding of new and extremely important con- cepts. RICHMOND TIMES-DISPATCH: The significance of this thrilling ac- count may go far beyond the fasci- nating interpretation of world hap- penings in connection with man's existence on this earth. The author has given to astronomers and cos- mologists something to ponder over. BECKLEY POST-HERALD, W. Va,: One of the most significant and fascinating books written since the invention of printing. Anyone who has read it can never feel quite the 'same.

It will make news for a long while to come. Possibly it will go ringing down the corridors of Time. Or possibly not, for the established orthodoxies are more than orthodoxies.

Velikovsky's heresies are enormous. They reach to the stars. . . . And what a case he makes! Already the orthodoxies have marked him down. Already the machines of repression are at work."}]
