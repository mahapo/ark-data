Later, however, a more critical approach to the Scriptures revealed incredibilities, impossibilities, and even obscenities, which both shocked and repelled me. Finding myself unable either to ignore these barriers to belief or to adop t a tolerant, uncritical acceptance of Holy Writ, two alternatives p re­ sented themselves. One was to discard entirely the orthodox conc;:ept of the Bible as an error-free and infallible source of spirit­ ual wisdom and moral counsel, and the other to undertake a de­ tailed study of the whole text. This latter course was chosen, and in this decision I was largely influenced by the discovery that many of the difficulties arising from a literal reading disappeared if por­ tions of the Bible were regarded as allegorical. Many erudite scholars, I found, affirmed that some of the authors of world Scriptures deliberately concealed beneath cleverly constructed veils of allegory and symbol profound truths which they had discovered by direct research. This enveiling was forced upon them because such knowledge would inevitably bestow very great spiritual, intellectual, psychical and supernormal physical powers. Since these powers were, and still arc, subject to grave misuse-th e evils of priestcraft and mental domination, for example - it became necessary to do all possible to make available to the trustworthy and to conceal from the profane the wisdom and knowledge of which the authors had become possessed. For this purpose they invented a special category of literature which differs from ordinary writing in that, with some historical fact as founda­ tion, it is largely composed of allegories, symbols and certain key worc!s. These were given an agreed universal significance, the whole constituting a cipher by means of which the ageless Wisdom Religion,1 theoretical and practical, was with reasonable safeguards made available to mankind. Such, I learned, were the origin, the nature and the purpose of the sacred language.2 1 Tho one religion which underlies all eraed5. 2 .AI Dictionary of th� StJcred Lunguagt vi All Sc:,.lptures ond Mylh�.

The rewards - the resolving of many textual difficulties and the gaining of a philosophy of life, spiritual, intellectual and pre· eminently practical - have been so immeasurably rich that I have felt moved to share them in book form. This first volum e is largely devoted to a consideration of the sacred language itself and the presentation of certain classic keys of interpretation, with some of the results of their application to scriptural stories, inclading especially the life of Christ. Although I have approached this task with all caution, naturally no claim is made for anything like a complete and error-free presentation. Care has, however, been taken neither to overstress a possible symbolical significance, nor to read into a narrative more than is inherent within it or was presumably present in the minds of the authors. Major interpreta­ tions have been both suggested by and compared with the writings of sages and philosophers, including Hebrew scholars. This com­ parison was made in order to test the validity of such an approach, and a l s o its value in providing a key to the scriptures a n d mytholo­ gies of ancient peoples. The quotations which precede this preface will indicate some of these literary sources, while the introduction and Chapter I give a fuller exposition of the central idea and its applications to both theological and world problems. One of the most readily available of such sources, I have found, is the literature of The Theosophical Society and, indeed, Theosophy itself so far as it has been made available to mankind. The Neo-Piatonists of the early centuries of the Christian era, notably Ammonius Saccus and his disciples, coined the word Theosophia, meaning Divine Wisdom.2 For them, Theosophy con­ noted the totality of the revealed wisdom and discovered knowledge allotted to man throughout the ages. The use of this source is mentioned here to explain, should it be necessary, the constant reference to theosophical literature, ancient and modern, and the adoption of some of its terminology.

Man, they state, has but to remove the concealin g veils of allegory, parable and symbol to discover a knowledge which can bestow serenity of mind and heart and lead to spiritual illumination. Mere folk tales and primitive superstiti ons apart, the scrip­ tures and mythologies of ancient peoples may, it is claimed, be similarly approached. At least two views exist concerning their origin. According to one of these, world myths gradually developed as explanations of the phenomena of nature. Primitive races, who possessed little or no scientific knowledge, personified the forces of nature and dramatized their interactions. Such tales may be thought of as folk myths in contradistinction to those based upon historical, or presumedly historical, foundations. The second view is that many of these ancient stories were given deep cosmogonical, religious, psychological and moral significance by poets, seers and prophets who later arose within the nations. Aeschylus, for example, thus relied upon Greek myth and legend for many of his plots, as also did Homer, Sophocles and Euripides and more especially Pindar and Hesiod, who in­ corporated the Homeric gods into the Greek pantheon. In this way many archaic legends were both preserved and vitalized, ha ving become imbued with religious or philosophic meanings. Initiates� of the various occult schools and the mystery religions of the older civilizations are also said to have deliberately refash­ ioned th e stories into vehicles for the transmission to later races of their know ledge of cosmogony, cyclic involution and evolution,3 and the true nature and destiny of man. Modern scientists have also found in ancient myths appropriate symbols for the subtle 1 St. Paul, Orlgen and other early Church Fathers: Xabalists, ancient, medieval, and modern .

In these various ways the religions and philosophies of the ancients prove profitable to the modern student, while those possessed of knowledge of the sacred language and the keys of interpretation 1 recognize ideas which are found to be common t o all world faiths. The universal use of symbols with which to portray those ideas makes them readily available; for the meanings of the symbols used are found to be constant, as constant also are the doctrines which they reveal. Thus, while ancient superstitions and magical practices, and the instinctive personification and dramatization of natural phenomena by primitive peoples, are recognized, world scriptures and mythologies may legitimately be regarded as rich mines of the ageless wisdom. On occasion through­ out this work, therefore, parallels are drawn between Biblical statements and the same ideas appearing in different forms in other sacred writings. The value of this approach to world scriptures becomes evident when the keys of interpretation are applied to the Bible. This has, however, been rendered difficult by at least three prev­ alent practices. The first of these is to mistake the veils for the truths which they both conceal and reveal. The second is to require the acceptance as fact of much that is purely allegorical and, indeed, in some cases incredible.2 The third is the insistence by some Christian denominations upon unquestioning belief in d ogmas, based upon a literal reading of certain passages of the Bible, as essential to the salvation of man here and hereafter. Unfortunately this is carried to still greater lengths by ex cathedra pronouncements that failure to affirm implicit belief in stated dogmas may lead to excommunication, and even to eternal damnation. These trends observable in orthodox Christianity may be regarded as particularly harmful at the present period in world history; for as a result of them the attention of Christians is 1 Pari II of Volume I. 2 Pp. 93-97 of Volume I."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"diverted from eternal verities. These especially include the exist­ ence of the divine presence within man, ''Christ in you, the hope of glory\",1 and the fact that the divinity in all men is one and the same. When the spiritual unity between all members of the human race is fully recognized, aggressive competition, organized crime and wars of conquest become impossibilities. The spiritually darkened, war-threatened and competitively divided condition of humanity today may well be among the tragic consequences of the long continued imposition by the spiritual heads of the Chris­ tian faith - doubtless with the highest motives and out of consid­ eration for the spiritual welfare of the people- of dogm as based upon the literal reading of Biblical allegories; for when accepted and applied to life such dogmas inevitably affect international, national and personal relationships. They may be partly responsible for the divided condition of Christianity, and even of humanity itself. How, then, may the veils of allegory and symbol be drawn aside and the hidden wisdom revealed? This work- among many others upon the subject in ancient and modem literature -oilers both general a n d detailed answers to that most vital question. Briefly stated, those who seek to discover th e wisdom underlying inspired allegories should proceed somewhat as follows:- (a) Determine to discover essential truths. (b) Mentally utter a cry for interior light,2 with the single motive of becoming an ever more efficient servant of humanity. (c) Oear the mind of the tendency to regard the literal read­ ing as the only true and ecclesiatically permissible one. (d) Practice meditation in order to develop the intuitive per­ ception necessary for the discovery of the successive layers of revelation concealed beneath scriptural allegories, ancient myths and some traditional fairy tales. (e) Study the writings of notable exponents of the sacred language. 1 Col. 1:27. 2Lk.ll:9,10. \"And I say unlo you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, a nd It shall be opened to you. \"Fur every one that askcth rcccivelh; and he that seeketh flnd4fth; aod to him that knockclh it shall be opened.\" �ii"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"(f) Learn the major keys and the method of interpretation, and practice until proficient the science of their applica­ tion to the elucidation of world scriptures and mytholo­ gies.

Thus studied, many books of the Old and New Testaments are found to contain hidden knowledge of the greatest value to mankind; for, in addition to its content of meta­ physical teachings of profound significance, the Bible also indi­ cates the existence of a pathway of hastened evolution and the means by which special powers for the service of humanity may be attained. These powers can, however, be misused to bring grave harm upon their possessors and also upon their victims. The more metaphysical teachings in the Bible are therefore, as also previously stated, written in an allegorical language which conceals, even while it reveals, power-bestowing knowledge. The Lord Christ referred to this pathway of hastened evolution as \"the narrow way\" which is entered through \"the strait gate\".1 Isaiah wrote of ''The way of holiness\".2 Hinduism similiarly teaches of the \"Razor-edged Path\" and Buddhism of the \"Noble Eightfold Path\".

WheR, furthennore, despite aff ronts to the intellect and a sense of pro­ priety, it is insisted that the Bible is divinely inspi-red from begin­ ning to end, then the adverse results become far-reaching indeed. Many moral evils may not unjustly be regarded as consequences of this choice. Indeed, such continued affronts cause some people to turn away from the Bible, from the religion founded upon it and, unfortunately, from the morality which Christianity inculcates. When faced with the piling of the incredible upon the impossible in the Old Testament, and its portrayal of the supreme Deity as an arrogant, ruthless and cruel despot,1 many people fall into atheism, agnosticism, cynicism and indulgence in vice. When, in addition, the Bible is found to contain accounts of frequent in­ dulgence in illicit, and even incestuous, sexual relationships, the Christian faith can come to be regarded as encouraging such practices, gross immorality being the unfortunate result. The existence of the above evils, among many others, points to the urgent necessity for a greatly revised reading of the Bible.

These considerations accentuate the great need for an inter­ pretation of the Bible as a repository of profound wisdo111 symboli­ cally portrayed. Such an interpretation would meet the objections inevitably aroused by a literal reading with all its consequences, so obviously harmful to rnankind. Certain portions of the text of the Bible, if taken literally, cannot possibly be regarded as in any way conducive to a high moral standard. In Genesis XII: 10-20, for example, Abraham passes off his wife as his sister that Pharaoh may possess her. His motive in doing so was that his Ji.fe might be spared and he be greatly rewarded. Isaac transgresses similarly and for the same reason, as stated in Genesis XXVI: 6-11. In this latter case the Lord God blesses Isaac and he becomes rich and prospers. Genesis XXVII: 1-45, recounts a most deplorable example of deliberate deceit by Jacob, who later becomes a favored patriarch under the inspiration of the Lord. In Judges IV:17-22 Jael, the wife of Heber, invites Sisera to enter her tent on the pretext of hiding him, and while he slept she took a hammer and with it drove a tent peg right through his temple and into the ground, thereby slaying him. In 2 Samuel XI: 2-27, is related the all too familiar story of the adultery of David, the Lord's anointed, with Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah. In Chapter XII the Lord pardons David, and King Solomon is bom of this union. Passages are also to be found which portray the Lord God as capable of anger and himself ready to destroy, and to encourage his servants to destroy, whole peoples other than Israelites. One such example is to be found in Deuteronomy IX: 14. The suggestions in verses five, six and seven of the sixth chapter of Genesis that the supreme Deity could conceive of an imperfect plan which failed, experience wrath at that failure, revengefully decide to destroy with insensate cruelty \"both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air\", in their literal reading are surely quite unacceptable. The assertion that God could be guilty of such actions and could be moved to"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"CHRISTIANITY & THE �ODERN WORLD 3 make the later promise not to \"curse the ground any more for man's sake\"1 or \"again smite any more every thing living\"! is either an erroneous attribution to the Deity of conduct of which even man would not be guilty, or else a deliberately constructed blind for the concealment of an underlying truth. The concept is inconceivable, surely, that there could be in existence a single, extra-cosmic, personal God who could fnil and then be destructively wrathful at the wicked conduct of the pro­ ducts of his own work. Such a conclusion is strengthened by the affirmation that man was created in God's own image.• It is, sim­ ilarly, inconceivable that the conjoined Elohim3 (translated as God in Genesis) could be capable either of error in the planning and fulfillment of their cosmic functions or of wrath at a failure which was solely attributable to themselves. In the presence of such affronts to human reason, the concept of the use of a special category of literature known as the sacred language, as previously defined, is surely preferable to total unbelief in such Biblical incon­ sistencies and errors as a literal reading necessitates. The con­ sequent possible rejection of the Bible as a whole, with its affirmation of the existence of a Supreme Being as the directive intelligence in nature, would indeed be a very great loss. The great scientist, Dr. Albert Einstein, evidently felt himself to be under no necessity to make the latter rejection, expressing his view that \"That deeply emotional conviction of the presence of a superior reasoning power [italics mine: Author] which is revealed in the incomprehensible Universe, forms my idea of God.\" Nevertheless, the actions attributed to the Deity in the verses under review certainly do not present him in the guise of a \"superior reasoning power.\" Since the episodes are unacceptable in their literal form, the idea receives support that the authors of the Pentateuch were spirit­ ually instructed men, writing to evoke wonder and so to start inquiry, to preserve, to conceal from the profane, and yet to reveal to the worthy, the wisdom which they had been taught.

Interpretations are there offered which, if accepted. remove the indications of guilt and reveal a profound wisdom con­ cealed beneath the veil of allegory, and even incongruity. Those who regard the scriptures and mythologies of the world as a combination of history, allegory and symbol, point out that full answers to these and other pressing questions concerning human life, experiences and destiny are contained beneath the surface of scriptural writings. They further state that such answers are there fully given as under-meanings, and that the relative impotence in the presence of world evils so evident in the orthodox Christianity of today is due to the official insistence upon belief in the Bible as divine, verbal revelation from Genesis to Revelation. Had orthodoxy been willing to examine the Scriptures as parables revealing profound spiritual truths and laws, instead of insisting that the text in its literal reading is divine utterance, and therefore absolute truth, it would not have been subject to the charges made against it. When, furt hermore, implicit belief in the letter of the Bible is stated to be essential to the salvation of the Soul, 1 a natural repulsion from the acceptance of dogmas, some of which contravene both fact and possibility, is intensified. Some Criticisma Lef!elled at Chriatianity A further charge levelled against modem Christianity is that it fails to grip the mind and direct the life and conduct of modem man; that it has proved impotent to influence favorably either human conduct or the progress of world events in the first half of the twentieth century, tragic as they have been for humanity. Is this criticism justified? If it is, what then is wrong with the Christian teaching and practice of today? While even the most devout Christians must admit - and surely may do so without impiety- certain limitations, nevertheless there is unquestionably a great deal to applaud in modem Chris­ tianity and the conduct of Christian peoples, though there is also much to deplore.

Other nations, however, guided by a truly Christian spirit and at immeasurable cost to themselves in men and material, have successfully resisted two major attempts to conquer, impoverish and enslave humanity. Furthermore, with the co-operation of non­ Christian nations two great world organizations have been formed to resist such wanton aggression, to preserve world peace, to com­ bat vice and to give assistance to peoples in need. Both the League of Nations and the United Nations Organization, formed for these purposes, have rendered very great service to humanity. In addition to these far-reaching international and national activities on behalf of the human race, an increasing number of individuals have embarked upon the search for truth, wisdom, knowledge and an understanding of the laws of life, material and spiritual. Many men of science are leading humanity in this search. In physics, astronomy, medicine, biology and psychology the mechanistic view is giving place to vitalism, to affirmations of belief in the existence of both a directive intelligence in nature and in a plan or aim in the evolution of life and form. Human conduct is, however, justly under criticism and Christianity as a great world religion cannot escape some responsibility for the conduct by which that criticism is aroused. Christian apologists reply that the responsibility is Jess with the Christian faith than with modem man. They point out that it is impossible to assess the full value of Christianity because, in fact, it has never yet been collectively and thoroughly tried.

There is far too much emphasis on preparing young people to earn a living, and not nearly enough on teaching them how to live.\" Such are some of the maladies afflicting modem man. Such is part of the problem confronting human beings, Christians and non­ Christians alike, as a family of people on earth. These are not only physical evils - they are also sicknesses of the soul. Living in the midst of them, man naturally seeks the appropriate source of healing, which ought to be found in religion. Most Western peoples tum, therefore, to the Christian religion and its official representa­ tives. When the body is sick a doctor is consulted, and when the soul is sick hope lies with the priest and what he prescribes, namely spiritual light, healing grace and practical guidance in the conduct of life.

This is severe criticism but, wherever the fault may lie, it cannot be truthfully denied that wickedn ess is indeed rampant upon earth. One answer has already been ad­ vanced. It is that the Christian ideal had not been fully tried; that it is, in fact, constantly denied by the mode of life followed by many professing Christians. The counsel and the example of Christ embodied in his life and in his words: \"These things I command you, that ye love one another'? and \"as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise\", 2 are ignored. In the economic and industrial fields it must be admitted that Christian civilization is founded upon the satanic doctrines: \"Each for him­ self and the devil take the hindmost\" and \"I am not my brother's keeper.\" Few, indeed, accept and ratify Einstein's noble dictum: \"Man is here for the sake of other men.\" This indictment might be regarded as too sweeping, however, for while it is true of much collective action it is definitely not true of individual practice, which includes \"the multitude of unparadcd charities of men.\" Nevertheless it is still true that, apart from cer­ tain religious orders, Christianity has not been tried collectively. The modern world has, for example, been confronted with the phenomena of Hitler, Mussolini, and their successors in the inter­ national field; prevalent di�honesty in trading, including the ped­ dling (especially to young people) of narcotics, not infrequently given without charge to induce addiction; prostitution and white slavery; the open and almost exclusive pursuit of temporal pleasures; radio and movie entertainments and advertisements which, deliberately and for profit, incite to lawlessness, sensuality, sexuality and artificial standards of living-all these are widespread characteristics of modern Western civilization. The frank and deliberate choice of these evil practices as means of gaining power and wealth is, indeed, a denial of that spirituality which was taught by precept and example by the founder of the Christian faith.

This personal disinterestedness con­ stitutes the tremendous dynamic of the teaching of Jesus; but the modem mental attitude - \"self first and God afterwards, if I have time\" - is indeed the reverse of this ideal of Christlike selflessness. Thomas a Kempis, even in his day, 1 saw this difficulty and wrote these wonderful words: - \"Know that the love of self doth hurt thee more than anything else in the world. With it everywhere thou shalt bear a cross. If thou seekest only thine own will and pleasure, thou shalt never be quiet nor free from care, for in every­ thing something shall be wanting.\"2 How true these words prove to be today! In everything we possess (and how much we do possess) something is wanting. In all our wealth, our scientific progress, inventions and mechanical development, something is indeed wanting. That \"something\" is happiness, health, serenity and peace based upon selflessness and obedience to moral law. Associated with the decline in morality is the growth of cyni­ cism, deepening to b i t te r n ess , both of which stem from lost faith and broken ideals. Those who meet adversity with bitterness and who, when tragedy and loss touch their Jives, feel that there can be no God; those who cry out for help and, failing to find it, in their despair sink into disbelief in their religion, and even deny the existence of God - all these people have not found in orthodox religion that immovable rock upon which their beliefs and their lives can be securely founded. This is a tragedy which Christianity - particularly its doctrines of impersonal law3 and of the Divine Presence within man,4 and its ideal of univer�al love5- migh t have averted. So far it has not done so, at least for very large numbers of its followers.

Receiving such an answer the modem mind, nurtured upon the science of the day, is inevita bly repe lled, and so rejects such a Deity and such answers to legitimate inquiries. Yet orthodox Christianity has no other answers to give and this, its critics say, is the reason for its impotence and for humanity's moral decline. If-as the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. Geoffrey Fisher, stated on November 14th, 1958 -half of the world is agnostic, the Church cannot escape some responsibility for this situation. While government provides laws and means of insuring obedience to them, and education provides knowledge and instruction concerning the ways in which further knowledge may be obtained, orthodoxy, except in certain closed orders, does not encourage the interior search for direct experience of spiritual truths and laws. Chri stians are not taught systematic self-purifica­ tion and elevation of consciousness as in yoga, or the science of realized union with God. What else is charged against the Christian faith and its officials? In addition to the criticisms alre ady noted, grave mis­ givings are also being expressed concerning the prevalent decline in the qualities of holiness and reverence . This is very tragic; for when a nation loses the sense of holiness and the quality of rever­ ence, that nation becomes subservient to a stronger nation. In these days the decline in respect for womanhood and for the parental (especially the maternal) functions, and in reverence for the sacra­ ment of marriage, is very marked. Sensuality and sexuality con­ stitute very grave dangers to modern civilization; for the loss in the active majority of a nation of the moral sense, and of the sense of the holy, leads to the downfall of that nation and to its subjec­ tion to a foreign power. This moral decline must be regarded as a very dangerous symptom. So fell Egypt, Greece and Rome."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"10 THE HIDDEN WISDOM II' THE HOLY BIBLE A furth er adverse symptom consists of the division of Chris­ tian thought and conduct of life into two compartments, sacrec! and secular, Sunday and weekday, which is responsible for many ill s. Ideally all life, with its work and achievement, is spiritual and this fact should be recognized day by day and hour by hour. Treason Darkens the Times The greatest casualty of World War II has been described as the decline of loyalty. One quality of human nature, disloyalty, has manif ested itself in an unusual degree in recent times. Indeed, a special term has come to be used for it, one with very evil connota­ tions. Th\\lt term is \"fifth column\", meaning treason as a chosen policy. When, in 1936, General Emilio Mola announced that he would capture Madrid because he had four columns outside the city and a filth column of sympathizers within, the world pounced on the phrase with the eagerness of a man who had been groping for an important word. The phrase was, in fact, a tocsin of calamity, as the subversion which followed demonstrates. What General Mola had done was to indicate the dimension of treason in our time. Other ages have had their indivi dual traitors - men who, from faintheartedness or hope of gain, betrayed their causes - but in the twentieth century, for the first time in history, men have banded together in millions in movements like Nazism, Fascism and totalitarian Communism, dedicated to the purpose of betraying the instit utions under which they live. Treason has become a vocation, the modern form of which is specifically the treason of ideas. This is indeed part of the darkness of these years. Faithlessness in this and other forms finds expression in the prevalent low moral standard in public life, marked as it is by corruption. This is particu larly evident in the sphere of politics, national and international. In a speech delivered during September 1951, Herbert Hoover, ex-President of the United States, said: \"I sometimes wonder what the 56 Founding Fathers, from their invisible presence in our Congressional halls, would say about the proce ssion of men in responsible offices who have come before its committees of this day ... of those who coquette with traitorship . . . .

Our da ngers are that we may commit suicide from within by complaisance of evil or by public tolerance of scandalous behavior:' While it is true that human nature is itself prone to these e\"·ils which, it is admitted, are not confined solely to Christendom, it is also true that one function of religious teaching and practice is to reduce them to a minimum by inspiring men to rise above them. If, however, instances of the prevalence of these evils are recorded in the Bib le, and in a literal reading the Deity or his insp ired repre­ sentatives are there found to be encouraging some of them, those who inculcate a dead-letter reading of these and other passages cannot escape some responsibility for similar actions indulged in by people whose religion is founded upon the Bible. The author here repeats the opinion. however, that although it is not suffi­ ciently followed. many Christian institutions do inculcate a high morality. Christendom has, in fact, produced large numbers of magnificent men and women, many of whom have become great servan ts of humanity. It can safely be affir med that many churches and their pastors, Sunday schools and their teachers, Christian workers, parents and schoolteachers, do exercise moral restraint and, in particular, tend to encour age Christlike conduct and a high moral standard among their young people. Blind Faith or Spiritual KMwledge? Nevertheless the prevailing conditions referred to do, indeed, indicate that modern Christianity is in need of revitalization. What, then, is absent? What is needed? The subject is immense, but in advance it may be said that Christianity suffered an irreparable loss when Gnosticism, in the true meaning of the word,1 was proscribed. What is wanted is the gnosis, i.e., direct knowledge. The emphasis in religion upon direct, interior spi ritual experience and the inter­ pretative reading of the Scriptures must be restored to replace blind faith, the literal reading of the Bible, dependence upon priests for salvation and for communion with God, and reliance upon J.ip service and outward observance.

Direct guidance in its attainment is not easily available in modem Christianity, which (save perhaps in certain closed orders) has lost much of its mystical element in these days·. Men and women of prophetic vision are rare. The appeal is rather to blind faith, despite what has been described as \"the piling of the incredible upon the impossible\" in both literal Scripture and imposed dogma. If laymen cannot believe, they are told to \"try to believe\". If they still cannot believe, they can come to be regarded as ungodly. The p a r a m o u n t importance of interior illumi nation, of direct spiritual experience, and of teac hing in the technique of meditation, greatly needs to be recognized and stressed; the absence of these elements is a grave weakness of modem Christianity. Does Christianity Speak with One Voice? The dividedness of the Christian faith is regarded as another of its great weaknesses. In 1951 Pres ident Truman told a large audience, the Washington Pilgrimage of American Churc hmen, that he had been unable to obtain agreement among religious groups on a common statement of faith in order to meet the Communist threat. \"I have asked them\", said Mr. Truman, \"to join in one common act which will affirm those religious and moral principles on which all agree. I am sorry to say that it has not yet been possible to bring the religious faiths toge ther for this pmpose of bearing witness that God is the way of truth and peace. Even the Christian churches have not yet found thems elves able to say with one voice that Christ is their Master and Redeemer and the source of their strength against the hosts of irreligion and the danger of world catas trop he.\" However, in 1959 Pope John XXIII issued an inv i t a ti on to the churches of the C a th o l i c faith to collaborate with him in removing barriers which divide them and drawing together in a spirit of co-operation for the service of humanity. It is fervently hoped that such efforts will succe ed, for Christianity cannot reach its highest effectiveness as long as it continues to be divided into so many sects that, despite the formation and the efforts of the World Council of Churches, wholehearted collabora­ tion for the common good is difficult to obtain. This weakness is increased when the claim is made for certain denominations that they alone represent true, authoritative Christianity, that their"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"CHRIS TIANITY & THE MODERN WORLD 13 priests are the only real priests, and that they possess exclusively the divinely appointed right to mediate between God and man. These claims are direct contr ad·ictions of the words of Our Lord, who said: \"And other sheep, I have, which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and oae shepherd.\"1 Two furtl:ler difficulties ia making Christianity effective in healing the ills of mao consist of the variability of Christian doctrines2 and the insistence that belief in them is essential to salvation. A study of Christian origins and of the history of the Church since the first ceatury reveals that many changes have occurred in the number and nature of beliefs held as essentials of the Chri stian religion by certain Christian bodies. The geocentric system is an example of a firmly held Article of Faith, disbelief in which, as in the case of Galileo, was regarded as heretical. Other beliefs have either undergone changes or have disappeared, evolvi ng man having outgrown them. It is clear, therefore, that they never were belie fs necessary for salvation, and that some of them simply were not true. Christian Orthodo%y and It• Limitation.

Indeed, many people at the present time are finding difficulty in accepting os literally and finally true such dogmas as: the infall ibility of the Old and New Testaments; that all maakind descended from one pair of original parents and that their procreative act constituted a \"fall\", or grave sin, which has been handed down to the whole human race as \"original sin\" by which every single member of the race has ever since been stained; that after some thousands of years the supreme Deity sent - once, and once only -his only Son down to earth in order that the harm done by the iniquity of the first parents of men might be undone, mankind thus being ran­ somed from the wrath of God; that to prevent this original sin from reaching the Lord Christ, who was both maa and God, he was 1/n. 10: 16. 2 Conrracepllon, rererred 10 \"\" ramlly plannlns. proscribed as uuerly Immoral unUI 1958. then became accepted. and even advocated, by the AD&lican communion u pro­ nounced at !:he Lambclh Conference O( that year."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"14 THE HIDDEN WISDOM I� THE HOLY BIBLE born of a virgin who had miraculously conceived; that the consum­ mation of the redemptive process consisted of his crucifixion at the insistence of the Jews, after which his body was raised from the tomb and later ascended into heaven; that in consequence of this sacrifice ali those - and presumably only those - who were able before they died to affirm belief in this group of ideas, would after death be washed white and clean \"in the blood of the Lamb\" ;1 furthermore, that the normal operation of the law of cause and effect, so strongly insisted upon by the Lord Christ2 and by the ap o stl e Paul,3 would be abrogated in the case of such believers, and that all who did not so affirm were in all probability con­ demned to eternal damnation, one concomitant of which is to be perpetually burned in the fires of hell without being destroyed,4 and another to become outcasts from God's love of the human race. Indeed, it must be admitted that modem doctrinal Chris­ tianity, thus objectively considered, does not meet the need of the modem mind, which says with the Psalmist: \"Give me understand­ ing, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall observe it with my whole heart\",� and with Paul: \"Prove all t h in gs; hold fast that which is good.\"8 A religion which offers no answers to the problem of justice for man on earth, for e xa m ple , cannot possibly grip and hold minds which in this age of rapid scientific d ev e l op m ent have become accustomed to logic, cause and effect, and demonstration of propounded ideas.

This last mentioned doctrine of the remission of sins can have sapped the moral fibre of many orthodox Christians. The opostle Paul makes it very clear, moreover, that the redeeming principle is within man; for he wrote: \"Christ in you., the hope of glory\";1 \"work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you ... \";2 \"T ill we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of Gocl, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ\";\" \"My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you.\"• From these and similar utterances we can legitimately assume that Paul believed that nothing outside of man can save him.

As long, however, as the Scriptures continue to be read either as the inspired word of God from beginning to end, or literally as history, the discovery will continue to be elusive, if not impossible.

This does not in the least imply the abandonment of the Bible itself. Far from it, but the literal reading of some passages of the Bible must be replaced by the study of them as revelations, by means of allegory and symbol, of eternal, spiritual truths. The all-illumin at-ing ami power-bestowing truth concerning the nature of man, that the divine presence is within him as a ray of the Supreme Deity, is revealed in the Bible both directly and under a veil of allegory, symbol and parable.

By its revelation of the living light which the great founder brought to men nearly 2,000 years ago, Christianity does contain that philos­ ophy and can make that greatly needed contribution. Despite the changes and accretions of the intervening centuries, that light still shines. Men and women of every walk of life, humble and exalted, have borne witaess to its shining and to their direct interior aware­ ness of the divine presence and power.

The Psalmist said: \"Be still, and know that I am God.\"1 Ritualists say that through participation in sacraments man may enter into conscious unity with the living Christ. Through loving service he may also leam to know, to love and to serve the God in all: through beauty he may perceive, worship, portray and discover God as \"the principle of beauty in all things.\" (Keats ).

Then someone called for a rctirBd minister to come up and repeat the 23rd Psalm. His sweet face shone with an inner light as he said the same words with reverence and meaning. When he had finished there was not a dry eye in the room . Afterward one of the students asked the professor why he, with his great learning, could not produce that profound ciTect. The professor was honest and humble in his reply : \"Well,\" he said to the young man, \"I have studied the Bible and I know all ubout the Shepherd but, you see, our friend knows the Shepherd.\" There, I suggest, is the heart of the problem of religion ; to know, by direct experience, the power and the presence of God nnd of his Son, Christ Our Lord. A Greek word for such direct interior spiritual knowledge is \"gnosis\", and at the time of the foundation of Christianity those who possessed it were known as Gnostics.

Reasons for Secrecy This method of writing is referre d to as the sacred or mystery lunguage, and is said to have been invented and used by sages of old in order both to reveal to those who would be helped, and to conceal from those who might be banned thereby, a deep spiritual wisdom which can bestow theurgic powers upon its possessors. The necessity for this reservation becomes clear when the use to which modern man puts scientific discoveries is observed. One example of the misuse of knowledge is the release, as the explosive agent in utomic bombs, of the energy derived from nuclear fission and fusion. 21"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"22 THE HIDDEN WISDOM IN THE HOLY BIBLE Reco gnizing that their discoveries belonged to the race, the philosophers and scientists of former days knew that such knowl­ edge placed in general hands, and particularly in those of dis­ ruptive elements in society, could be extremely dangerous . They therefore constructed the cryptic language in which the inspired scriptures and mythologies of the world have been written. Al­ though based in general upon historical events these narr atives, as earlier sugges ted, have under-meanings and in some cases even a sevenfold significance. While apparently founded on fact, each story is rather an historical metaphor, having an inner purport and containing within itself layer upon layer of hidden knowledge. Teaching by Parablea Our Lord made use of this method of teaching. When address­ ing his disciples he spoke openly of spiritual truths, but to non­ disciples in parables. Indeed, he used the words: \"Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet and turn again and rend you.\"1 He also said to them: \" ... Unto you is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without all these things are done in parables .\"2 One reason for this differ entiation is not far to seek. Knowl­ edge can bestow power, and the writers of the sacred language were in the same position in which a small group of modem scientists would find themselves after having first discovered atomic energy and the means for its controlled releas e. They would not dare immediately to make their discovery universally available. Similarly the wise men of old, having investigated the structure of matter and the composition of both universe and man, and dis­ covered the forces locked up within them, would feel a tremendous sense of respons ibility. They would have had to prevent the misuse of their knowledge, and at the same time to insure its preservation for the future benefit of mankind.

In wrong hands the power which such knowledge makes available is far more dangerous than physical atomic energy. The products of nuclear fission and fusion can destroy o n l y physi­ cal objects. If misused, occult knowledge and the power associated with it, can in addition impair the integrity, harden and warp the nature, and in consequence seriously retard the evolution, of the transg ressors and those under their malign influence. The ancient seers therefore devised not the algebraical symbols and formulae of the modern scientist, but a cryptic language in which some of the words retain their normal meaning , while others are crypto­ grams or hierograms for spiritual and occult truth s. In doing this the writers of old knew that only those who possessed the keys of interpretation would be able to discover the truths which the sacred language both reveals and conceals. The secret is rendered still safer by the fact that, in order successfully to use the keys, one must have developed the intuitive faculty and be imbued with a sense of moral respo nsibility. Such, briefly and but partially described, are the origin and some of the purposes of the sacred langu age in which the scriptures and mythologies of ancient peoples were written."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"CHAPTER III PROBLEMS ARISING FROM A LITERAL READING OF THE BIBLE, AND SOME SOLUTIONS SINCE comprehension and apprec iation of the esoteric teachings contained in the Bible depend upon a knowledge of the sacred language, a fuller and more detailed exposition of this particular category of literature must now be given. At the outset of this task it is recognized that to those who have hitherto regarded the Bible solely as a record of historical events, the idea that it was written in allegory and symbol in order to tra nsmit universal truths to man­ kind may seem strange, and even incr edible. Prepararory Study Since the subject is profound, impartial examiaation and pro­ gressive study are essential to its comprehe nsion. Apart from the parables of Jesus, the language of analogy, dramatic allegory aa.d symbol is for many people a little known art form. Vocabulary, grammar and composition must, in consequence, be carefully studied before the transmitted ideas can be perceived and wholly understood. Time, too, is always required in order to become accustomed to an unfamiliar method of presentation and hitherto unknown aspects of truth. In art, some training in appreciation is necessary in order to enjoy and understand a great picture and receive the artist's message. Preparation and experience are needed in order to open the eyes and prepare the mind. This is true also of music. With the 24"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"PROBLEMS FROM LITERAL READING 25 exception of those passages - perhaps the slow movements - which can be readily enjoyed, a symphony can at first hearing be Llilficult to comprehend. As one begins to perceive its significance, however, the work takes on an added meaning and evokes a new delight. To a child a wonderful jewel is but a glittering toy. He will choose just as readily any shining thing, however tawdry and cheap. A connoisseur in precious stones, on the other hand, sees in them depths of beauty hidden from others, comprehends and appreciates both the stones themselves and the craftsmanship of the jeweller. The language of allegory and symbol may, in its turn, be regarded as an art form. One therefore similarly needs to acquire by practice the ability to appreciate its many and varied metaphors und emblems and to discover their secret meanings. Without such preparation allegories and symbols may be wrongly regarded as unnecessary obstructions and their interpretations as arbitrary, or at best far-fe tched. Since profound truths are conveyed and spir­ itual experience, knowledge and power can be obtained by ilie successful interpretation of the Bible, the student's preparations must in their turn be not only intellectual, but spiritual as well. Indeed, such preparations assume the character of a vigil. The Veil of Allegory While many of the incidents in the Bible are doubtless founded upon fact, nevertheless great wisdom and light are to be discovered within the scriptural record of historical and pseudo­ historical events. When, however, statements are made which could not possibly be true, three courses of action present thems elves to the reader. He can accept them unthi nkingly in blind faith; he may discard them as unworthy of serious considerat ion; or he may study them carefully in search of possible under-meanings and revelations of hitherto hidden truths. Incidents such as the passage of three days and nights and the appearance on earth of vegetation before the creation of the sun,' and the action of Joshua in making the sun and moon stand still,' cannot possibly have occurred. Here, as in so many other places, the Bible \"piles the incredible upon the impossible\". If, however, the intention was not to record supposed 1 Gen. I: 13-16. 2 loshOUJ 10: IZ-14. vide p.

Before that truth and light can be percei v ed, however, the veil of allegory must be lifted and the symbols interpreted; for, as previously stated, partly in order to render abstract ideas com­ prehensible by expressing them in concrete form, and also to safeguard the truth and yet reveal it when the time should be ripe, the teachers of ancient days deliberately concealed within allegory and symbol the deep, hidden wisdom of which they had become posses sed.� Time As !Jiirror of Eternity The authors of the scriptures saw eternal truths mirrored in events in time. For them, illumined as they were, every material happening was alight with spiritual significance. They knew the outer world for what it was - the shadow of a great reality. They could say with Elizabeth Browning: \"Earth's crammed with heaven and every common bush atire with God\", and with her would add \"but only he who sees, takes of.I his shoes.\"3 Their records of the history of the universe and of the earth - the scriptures of the world - portray far more tfuan events in time; they reveal in con­ crete and therefore more readily understal'!dable form eternal truth, ultimate reality, universal occurrences. Sometimes the real was more visible to them than the shadow, whereupon history took second place. At other times the record of physical events pre­ dominated. This concept of the purposes and the method of the ancient writers is advanced in this work as the key to the mystical study of the Bible, the clue to the discove ry of the inexhaustible treasures of wisdom and truth concealed within the casket of exoteric scriptures. 1 h. 35:8. 2 O t her reasons for such unveiling were� to evoke wonder and so Initiate inquiry: to presern for posterity profound spirJtual and therefore power-bestowing truths: and to conceal from the profane know l edge which could be misused, c:vcn while revealing it to the selHMS servant or bumanity. 3 Poems of Elizabeth M.

Even thousands of years after their death such tea che rs are able to give to mankind both guidance along t he path­ way o f spiritual illumination and t h e solutions of human problems.

Some Difficulties Created By A Dead-Letter Reading of the Bible In addition to its value as a vehicle for hidden wisdom, the sacred language can prove helpful in solving otherwise insoluble Biblical problems. While belief or faith in the possibility of super­ natural intervention makes some scriptural statements credible, nevertheless physical laws and astronomical facts cannot be changed. Admittedly some miracles strain almost beyond reason­ able limits one's power to believe them. The hydrostatic pressure exerted in dividing and holding back on either side of a dry bed the waters of the Red Sea1 and the river Jordan2 must have in­ volved the use of almost incalculable energy. Nevertheless, if direct th eu r gi c action is presumed to have occurred, then t.hese \"miracles\" would not have been impossible. The heliocentric system, however, cannot be altered. The sun is at the center of our solar system, for which it is the source of light. Planets throughout their orbital motion round the sun revolve on their axes, without which rotatien there could be no alternation of day and night.

This would have been an astronomi­ cal impos sibility. \"Sun, Stand Thou Still Upon Gibeon\" 1 The rotation of the earth causes night and day. The sun does not move round the earth and cannot by any humanly conceivable means be made to do so, yet Joshua is said to have lengthened the day by making both the sun and the moon stand still. The pro­ longation of day or of night by the arrest of the motion of either sun or earth (the mom1 would not be directly concerned in such a procedure) is a total impossibility; for if the earth had suddenly stopped turning no human being would have lived to record the event. Every movable object on earth, including the oceans and the atmosphere, would have continued the normally rotating move­ ment and thus travelled towards the east faster than the speed of sound. Thus, read literally, the narrative is totally incredible. The story of Noah and his ark also presents grave stumbling blocks. It would have been extremely difficult, if not impossible, to collect pairs of animals from the four quarters of the earth ; the sloth, for instan ce, which travels with extreme slowness - hence its name perhaps -would have needed to begin its journey long before the onset of the Flood to reach the ark in time. Furthermore, the task of housing and feeding so large a number of animals throughout forty clays and forty nights would have presented grave, if not insurm ountable, difficulties. The literal reading of the story of the Tower of Babel, and especially of verses six, seven, eight and nine of the eleventh chapter of Genesis, would seem to imply that the Supreme Deity is deliberately and callously responsible for the major sufferings of mankind. Accorcling to the text, many evil works by man upon man, including indiv idual and orgaRized crime a nd the waging of innumerable wars, arose and still arise from the two supposed actions of a personal Deity, first in confounding human language so that men cal'! no longer understand one another's speech, and second il'l scattering humanity abroad upon the face of the earth.

This attribution to the Supreme Deity of motive and con­ duct so detrimental to humanity as to make difficult for long ages the attainment of harmonious human relationships between groups, nations and races of men upon earth, is totally unacceptable to any thoughtful and reverent mind. The study of the Bible less as literal history, and far more as a revelation of fundamental truths by means of historical metaphors and allegories, thus receives strong support from the story of the Tower of Babel. In the case of Jonah, the digestive secretions and processes occurring in the stomach of a large mammal like a whale would have rendered it extremely unlikely that Jonah could have remained alive and unaffected after three days and three nights of subjection to such disintegrating forces. Incr edibilit y apart, the obscenity, such as the drunkenness of Lot and his incest with his two daughters;' the sensuality; the brutality; the attribution to the Supreme Deity of the human weak­ nesses of anger, jealousy, bloodthirstiness, and his encouragement of the Israelites to attack and massacre the animals, men, women and children of other tribes - these are all Biblical incongruities which thoughtful and sensitive people must find repel lent.

They contain truths of a religious nature, he stated, which do not depend upon historical or scientific confirmation for their validity. The Genesis accounts expressed truths of a timeless nature. They were myths, teaching spiritual truths by allegories. In October 1962 The New Zealand Herald published a state­ meat by the Rev.

Incredibilities and impossibilities in both the Old and the New Testaments are referred to later on in this and successive volumes of this work, and explanations and interpretations of some of them are offered. One explanation given of these incongruities is that they were not contained in the original writings . Later interpreters, editors and translators are, by some Biblical scholars, held responsible for a number of them. Belief in the literal verbal inspiration of the Bible has been applied, it is said, to these altered and translated versions, and not to the origif.lal texts. While doubtless there is some truth in this view, maay of the criticisms can successf ully be met and most of the problems solved if once the existence of the sacred language be accepted and its symbolism be applied in interpretation of the scriptur es. My own studies have led me to the conclusion that deliberate interference with original texts, deletions, interpolations, successive editings and translations have undoubtedly been partly responsible for the confusion. In con­ sequence, the repellent passages, the many mis-statements of fact, and the attribution to the Supreme Deity of the characteristics of a bloodthirsty tribal fetish, make the literal reading of many portions of the Old Testament entirely unacceptable. Nevertheless, in those books which bear the imprint of in­ spiration , in conformity with the allegorical method of writing, the statement of impossibilities may be, it is submitted, part of a carefully constructed cover or blind, a veil of incredibility, incon­ gruity, absurdity, iRconsequence, fantasy, and even horror. The previously quoted words of Moses Maimonides, the Jewish theologian and historian, may here usefully be repeated: \"Ev ery time you find in our books a tale, the reality of which seems impossible, a story which is repugnant to both reason and common sense, then be sure that the tale contains a profound allegory veiling a deeply mysterious truth; and the greater the absurdity of the letter, the deeper the wisdom of the spirit.\" The Testimony oJ Early Aurkorlti� The existence of a secret meaning of the Scriptures is again openly confessed by Clement of Alexandria (A.D. 150-220 ap­ proximat ely) when he says that the Mysteries of the Faith are not"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"PROBLEMS FROM LITERAL READING 33 to be divulged to all. \"But\", he says, \"since this tradition is not published alone for him who perceives the magnificence of the word, it is requisite, therefore, to hide in a Mystery the wisdom spoken, which the Son of God taught. \"1 Not less explicit is Origen with regard to the Bible and its symbol ical fables. \"If we bold to the letter\", he exclaims, \"and must understand what stands written in the law after the marmer of the Jews and common people, then I should blush to confess aloud that it is God who bas given these laws; then the laws of men appear more excellent and reasonable. \"2 \"What man of sense\", he \\'vTites, \"will agree with the state­ ment that the first, second and ·third days, in whicb the evening is named and the morning, were without sun, moon, and the stars, and the first day without a heaven?

Indeed, the story may rightly be regarded as self-contradictory, even absurd. In that very absurdity, however, is said to be both a clue to the mea ni·ng and an encouragement to look for the wisdom concealed within the supposed narr ative of events. The world's allegories are, in fact, less re<\"ords of events in time and place than both descriptions of interior experiences and enunciat ions of universal laws. Simply put, the particular law here refe rred to is that if all living things and beings, inclu ding races, nations and men, do not share the fruits of their lives, they will metaphorically wither away and die. Individ­ ually applied, the person who seeks to have, to hold and to hoard for himself alone the fruits of his life - his outer possessions and his discovered wisdom, truth and power - giving nothing to others, that person will inevitably find that his own life, outer and inner, stagnates and atrophies.

Obedience to this law brings not loss but gain, not death but everlasting life. Disobedience of this law brings not gain but loss, not life but death. This has been repeatedly demonstrated throughcut the history of both nations and individuals. This principle is fundamental, for it is the law by which the universe subsists. The Logos himself nourishes and sustains the solar system by the perpetual outpouring, self- giving, \"self- empty­ ing\" (keno sis, Gr. ) of his own life. This kenosis (the self-emptying attitude of mind and mode of life) is a key-word in the Christian religion. It is applied to the life of the disciple by Our Lord in his words: \" ... he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life etemal\",1 and \" ...

The poverty of the nativity of Jesus, the surrender to Pilate, to the Jews and to crucifixion, the exposure of the sacred heart, the endurance of open wounds and the piercing of the skin, are all symbols of this attitude of uttermost selflessness towards life. Such self-emptying, such entirely self-forgetting love and such figurative death are necessary, it is said, for the attainment of more abundant life. To \"die\" to the sense of separated individuality, to outgrow egoism and possessiveness-this is to live unto life eternal. Mysteri­ ous and even contradictory though such a statement appears, it is nevertheless thought by all great mystics to be one of the greatest truths ever uttered. Apparently we are in the presence of a strange Jaw. In order to Jive the larger life in imitation of the Great Exemplar, the Lord of Love, we must die to self-des ire: we must pour ourselves out in selfless sacrifice and service: we must surrender self for Jove's sake. Universal lo ve is the only true way to eternal life, because it involves \"self-emptying\" of self. Self-forgetfulness is the basis of all spirituality. Every sincere esotericist is faced with this truth and with this necessity. The renunciation seems always to be of that which we hold most dear. Applied to the Logos, these words \"self-emptying\" and \"dying\" are not to be taken as wholly express­ ing the truth; for, of course, the Logos does not ever become empty, nor does \"He\"2 ever really die. The Logos is ever self­ renewed from a higher dimension. Similarly, the sun, which in occult philosophy is regarded as his physical \"heart\", does not exhaust itself despite its immeasurable outpouring, for proportion­ ate inpouring occurs. This is also true in every walk of life, whether secular or spiritual.

O ne simplifi11d interpretation of this passage, here offered in ad­ vance of the fuller and more detailed expositions to follow,2 is that the flesh of Christ represents spiritual knowledge. When the human intellect has absorbed and become illumined by divine truth and is in!ipired by interior revelation, this experience is sym­ bolically described as the eating of the flesh of the Deity. The blood of God, or Christ, is the ever-outpoured Divine Life by which the universe is sustained, without which it cannot live. When a spiritually illumined man, having become aware of this universal Life in all beings, becomes consciously identified with it, be is said in the symbolical language to drink of the blood of God, or Christ. An enriching mento-spiritual experience is described in terms of physical nourishment. Indeed, as our Lord said, these two attainments bring a realization of i mmortality or entry into eternal life. Peace Be StiU The story of the stilling of the tempest3 is another example of an inspired allegory. In a human and psychological interpreta ­ tion the ship may be regarded as a S}mbol of the body of man, which conveys the Soul with its various attributes over the waters of life. The disciples are regarded as personifications of human qualities and tendencies, such as: the impulsiveness of Peter; the simplicity of James and Jo h n , sons of Zebedee, who were fisher­ men; the business capacities of Matthew; and the deep and fail:hful Jove of John, the only disciple who was present both in t he court­ r o om and at the foot of t h e cross. Judas, who betrayed his Master, is also present in each one of us as the tendency to fall below, and even betray, our highest principles for material gain. Happily the divine presence also exists in each one of us, even if aslee p for a time, just as Our Lord slept when the voyage began. A great storm 1 Jn. 6:53·54. 2 VIde: Part Two, Ch.

Interpreting and applying this story to the storms of huma n life (especi ally of emotion, as is indicated by placing the incident upon water), when assailed by temptation, driven by desire or wishing to eradicate an unwanted habit, we are advised to with­ draw our thoughts from the difficulty, concentrate powerfully upon our divine nature and, to the exclusion of every other thought, affirm its irresistible power. Then the da rkness of the undesirable state of mind will disappear in the great light shining out from the God within. Symbolically, the awakened Christ will still the tempest. Thus, in its purely human application the story shows us that when we are threatened by the storms of life, the gusts of passion, anger and hatred and the cravings of sensual desire, which threaten the success and even the safety of our lives, we should awaken the sleeping, divine power within us and call upon its aid. Thus exalted and empowered, we shall find ourselves able to say to the tempestuous aspects of human nature with certainty of obe­ dience - \"Peace, be still.\" The importance of the trials and stresses of life is also indicated in this wonderful story; for had it not been for the storm on Galilee the Christ might not have been awakened. So, also, the struggles and storms of our lives. These can prove to be the means of the awakening of our higher, more spiritual powers. The Miracles of Healing The story of the woman healed after twelve years of incurable sickness' is also capable of a symbolical interpretation, as are all the accounts of miraculous healing b y the Christ. A deep faith awoke in this woman, so that she set forth to find the great teacher and healer who was in her land. Despite her weakness she found him, but was unable to come near on account of the throng of people in the way. Her faith was great, however; she stretched forth her hand and touched, not his person but the hem of his garment, and straig htway she was whole. 1 Mall. 9:28-22, Mk. 5:�-34, Lk. 8:43-48."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"42 TilE HIDDEN WISDOM IN THE HOLY BIBLE \"Every One That l11 of the Truth lleareth My J'oicem The Christ undoubtedly possessed and exercised superior knowledge and power which enabled him to perform seeming miracles.

Integration, wholeness, relative perfection, are attained. Mystically, the Master within draws the disciple into union with himself. This process is assisted by the external Master who increases the idealism, the power and the aspiration of the outer man so that he becomes responsive to the Master, the Christ, within. Whip, Naiu, Thorn� and Spear The weapons by which wounds are made symbolize the dangers through which knowledge of the mysteries may alone be approached, and by which those mysteries are guard ed. The crown of thorns portrays the true royalty of spirit and indicates that sovereignty is only attained by suffering. The thorns, nevertheless, symbolize the possibility, which is almost a certainty, that suffering will result from the wrongful use of the separative and analytical attributes of the formal mind, especially in the early stages of its development. These mental characteristics inevitab ly cause pain and sorrow (the pricks of the thorns ), and since the head is the physical center of mental life the thorns are placed upon it as a crown. Before perfection the two aspects of the mind in man - the higher and the lower (the two thieves crucified with Christ) - strive continually for mastery, and the pains and wounds of that mystical conflict are also symbolize d by the thorns, the whip, the nails, the spear, and the pain they produce . The true meaning of the crown of thorns is ever unperceived, is indeed unrecognizible, by unillumined men (the throng demanding and watching the Crucifixion ). By them it is thought to be a crown of thorns, a mockery of royalty, since the suffering only and not the triumph and the mystical coronation are seen. 1 The sick woman who Hnds the Christ."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"44 TilE HIDDEN WISDOM IN THE HOLY BIBLE The Rose and the CroBI In one aspect the opened rose upon the cross, in Rosicrucian symbolism, also repr esents perfected manhood. The rose is a sym­ bol of the higher Self of perfected man in its body of light. from which universal love, wisdom and blessing flow out upon the world, as represented both by the special fragran ce o f t:he flower and by the water and the blood flowing from the w o un d s of the crucified Christ. The cross is generally interpreted as the symbol of self­ sacrifice, immortality and holiness. Esoterically, however, the cross describes the whole mystery of creation. Crea tive spirit as the positive, masculine creative potency, the Great Breath or \"Word\" (the vertical arm ), d e s c e nds into and penet rates matter as Space, the feminine creative potency, the Great Deep (the horizontal arm). The point of inter section is the critical center at which the process of creation occurs and from which the product, the manifested cosmos, arises. In this sense the rose upo n the cross symbolizes the newly-form ed universe. The descent of spirit into matter (the vertical into the horizontal arm of the cross ), an d the subsequent attainment of self-conscious and per­ fected life (the rose), also suggests the proces ses of involution and evolution, of forth going and return, depicted in the parable of the Prodigal Son.1 Cruciform Man Man himself is perfectly symb olized by the cross, the v ertic al arm repr esenting the spirit in him an d the horizontal the material entered, im p r e g nate d and supported by the former.

Thus the rose upon the cross is both a beautiful and a dynamic symbol and an ideal to which to aspire, despite the inevitable pricks of the thorns. Upon lhe Mount The mount is frequently used as a symbol of exalted states of consciousness. Many of the great events recorded in the Bible occurred on mountain tops. Elijah, for example, had need of the counsel of the Lord and a voice said: \"Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD.\"' This is interpreted as an exhortation to elevate the center of human awareness from the physical to the inner spiritual nature of man. Earthquake, Wind and Fire In the story of Elijah, illumination was preceded by an earth­ quake, rushing wind and fire. The earthquake is a symbol of the purely physical state of consciousness and of the instability and impermaneRce of the physical world, also symbol-ized by the sand upon which a house must not be built. The rushing wind refers to the disturbed state of the «motions, while the fire in one meaning represents the restless and disruptive activity of the critical, analytical and prideful mi·nd. The Lord was not in any of these three phenomena; but after they had passed, a great peace descended upon Elijah. His Soul was steeped in silence and in that stillness \"the voice of the silence\", the \"still small voice\" of God, was heard. The story may now be seen as a manual of meditation, a description of the means whereby self-illumination may be obtained. The center of self-awareness must be dissociated from ilie physical body (earthquake ), from the emotional body (rushing wind), from the mind (fire ), and established on those still higher lev«ls wherein the Spiritual Self of man perpetua lly abides.

Man is, in fact, described as an epitome of the whole unive rse, a reproduction in miniature of all nature, visible and invisible.' This fundamental concept was known by ancient philosophers as the theory of the macrocosm or \"Great World\" and the micro­ cosm or \"little world.\" In the reflection of the macrocosm (God and the universe) in the microcosm (man ) was said to lie the key to all knowledge ; for through the part the whole may be percei ved: through knowledge of the individual the universal may be com­ prehended. Hence the words carved over the doors of the mystery temples of old: \"Man, Know Thyself.\" \"Man,\" says the Ancient Wisdom, \"is that being in whom highest Spirit and lowest matter are united by intellect.\" Man is an epitome of the cosmos, a microcosm in which the macrocosm exists potentially. If, as was taught and believed in the ancient schools, all nature exists potentially in man, then a clue may be discovered to a mystical meaning of the words of the title of this chapter. 1 lnlroduclion, Occu/1 Pow�r in �\\lature and In Man, Geoffrey Hodson. 48"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"THE SUN STANDS STILL 49 The refere nce may be not to the external physical sun at all, but to a solar power and light indwelling within both nature and man. \"Life is a pure flame,\" says Sir Thomas Browne, the English mystic, \"and we are lit by an invisible sun within us.\" In the sixtieth chapter of the Book of Isaiah, which reads like a charge to an initiate, there is also a suggestion that, at a certain stage of evolution, a sunlike source of light is revealed or self­ declared within the spiritually awakened individual. He disco v er s an interior light and thereafter is no longer mentally and spiritually subjected to the alternations of night and day. The sun within him becomes his light for evermore. The chapter begins with the words : \"Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the LoRD is risen upon thee.\" Later verses read: \"The sun shall be no more thy ligh t by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee: but the LORD shall be unto thee an everlastmg light, and thy God thy glory.\" \"Thy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon withdra w itself: for the LORD shall be thine everlusting ligh t, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended.\"' There is evidence here that neither the physical sun nor the physical moon are r e f e r red to. It is apparent that some other non­ physical source of illumina tion is denoted. A further interesting reference fro.m the Bible, which sup­ ports this concept of the sun, is contained in the story of Joshua and his power to cause the sun and moon to stand still. Joshua ha d gone from Gilgal to relieve the besieged city Gi b eo n , in answer to a call from its citizens. After the victory an extraordinary, not to say impossible, event is said to have occurr ed: \"Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the Am orites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valle y of Aja[on. 1 /J. 60:19. zo."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"SO THE HIDDEN WISDOM IN THE HOLY BIBLE \"And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies.

As previously stated it is the earth which moves, not the sun, and if the earth's rotation were suddenly arres ted it would probably disintegrate. Morever, if the sun had remained in the midst of the heavens there would have been neither need for nor value in a similar arrest of the movement of the moon. Joshua Make/J the Sun Stand Still What, then, is mystically implied by Joshua's action in keep­ ing the sun \"in the midst of heaven\"? What is the significance of the statement, made both in the account of this incident and also in certain rituals of in itiation, that the sun can be held still at its meridian? In occul t philosophy the sun within man is his highest Spiritual Self, the Monad, center and source in him of that divine fire and light of which, in their essence, both macrocosm and microcosm consist. The moon, on the other hand, is used as a symbol of mortal man, who derives his light from the Spiritual Self or sun within, and with varying degrees of perfe ction and in different phases reflects that solar light. The sun and the moon may therefore be taken to represent immortal and mortal aspects of human nature, the spirit and the flesh of man. If one accepts this interpretation Joshua \"is revealed as a highly developed man, an initiate of the greater mysteries or school of the prophets perhaps, who before he can pass to the next phase of his unfol dment must have brought the highest (sun) 1 Joshoa 10:12-14."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"THE SUN STANDS STILL Sl and the lowest (moon ) aspects of his nature under his control and placed them in harmo nious relationship. In his outer life he must also have acquired the power to maintain the spiritual sun within him always at its meridian, or position of m:�ximum power. In terms of physical life and conduct, this may be taken to imply attainment of the power to rule all outer activit ies by spiritua l will ami according to spiritual laws. Since this power is dangerous the way to its attainment is concealed, even while revealed, under a veil of symbology and, indeed, of absurdity. In terms of the seven principles' of man, Joshua represents the mind. up to a certain stage of unfoldment the mind imprisons, distorts and, in consequence, frequently loses the light of the in­ terior sun, the di,ine Self within. Intellectually man is subject to night and day, or to alternating periods of spiritual and intellectual light and darkness. When, however, symbolically the battle of Gibeon has been successfully fought, as by Joshua, then victory has been attained by the mind over both sun and moon, and mastery achieved of interior spiritual power and light and of their material expression. The 1Hysfical Battle of Gibeon The description of the battle of Gibcon, like many others in world scriptures, may be thus regarded as an allegory of the uni­ versal and perpetual Armageddon for which the whole of nature, and so man himself , is the field. It is the univer sal and individual conflict between spirit and matter, life and form, consciousness and vehicle of expression. Joshua personifi es the man in whom that battle has been won, as Gibeon was won, by the aid of the Lord, the divine in man. Victory was attained because the forces of both sun and moon, or his spiritual and material natures, were under his control. He, himself, had placed his sun at its meridian or position of maximum power. Never again could the lower quaternary, the fourfold personality, obscure the rays of the threefold spiritual sun, the divine Self within. The peace after the conflict may be taken to refer to that still­ ness of mind in which alone the direct rays of the spiritual sun can shine down into the mortal personality and illumine it.

The Ancient Wisdom aa Sun Stillness of mind has ever been recognized as essential to self­ illumination. Elijah heard the divine voice not in earthquake, wind or fire, but in the silence which followed after they had passed. The Psalmist enunciates this law in the words: \"Be still, and know that I am God . . . \"2 The Ancient Wisdom itself is also regarded by many as the source of both the body of ideas common to world faiths and the spiritual light received by man; for just as the physical sun brings light and life to the evolvin g forms of nature, so the Ancient Wisdom is as a sun which brings illumination to the unfolding minds of m e n . Ideally, orthodox religion should perfonn the two important functions of revealing to mankind this light of the Ancient Wisdom and providing the means whereby that light directly reaches the brain-min d of man. This the greater mysteries have done, for when a person is admitted to a valid occult order he receives that light. In addition, the act of consecration and the training which precedes and follows it help to open his consciousness to its rays. Successive initiations are recognitions of successive ascents into higher states of consciousness. Each ascent both draws the initiate nearer to the Source, the spiritual sun, and by stimula­ tion of appropriate physical and superphysical sense-organs in­ creases his ability to perceive its light. Symbol ically, the sun is first placed at its meriuian or place of maximum power and there­ after is maintained in that position.

There it is met by and united with the descend­ ing solar fire. Such union is sometimes symbolized by marriage, and even by illict unions.

When successful, meditation on the fiery orb leads the aspirant into its heart, in which the fire and the force aspects of the solar system begm to be perceived. From this point of view the universe is all sun.

Nevertheless direct experience of them still remains an interior secret, an esoteri cism, which can be personally realized but never fully conveyed to others. The way to such knowledge is also both revealed and concealed in the scriptures and mythologies of mankind. This \"narrow way\" has from the earliest period of man's occupation of the earth been followed by a small number of spiritually awakened human beings. Guidance concerning this spiritual way of life, and descriptions of experiences through which the soul passes and of the tests, ordeals and triumphs of the neophyte, run like a silver thread through the tapestry woven by the inspired authors of the scriptures and mythologies of ancient peoples. In one interpretation of them ­ the initiatory - the great figures, heroes, prophets, apostles, saviors and their adversaries, represent followers of the ancient way at various stages of attainment or failure. The accounts of the lives of such people as Jacob and his twelve1 sons, the twel ve tribes of Israel, the twelve disciples of Christ, and Hercules and his twelve labors, have proved extremely instructive to those who can pierce the veil of allegory beneath which the secrets of discipleship and initiation are concealed. The teachings of the Agele� Wisdom are thus to be found at the heart of the great world faiths as a group of central doctrines common to them all. The Ancient Wisdom is indeed the oldest of all religions, having from the first ineluded the highest and noblest conceptions of the soul of man which have ever been presented to or recognized by the human mind, and knowledge of the nat!lfe of the divinity within him. Theosophia is the wisdom of divine beings. and carries with it the idea that divine wisdom bas been and can be attained by man as the natural and logitimate goal of his evolution. This univer sality is revealed by an examination of the sacred books of various religions and the original say.ings of the world's greatest teachers, for a singular uniformity is found in them all. One might readily suspect that this uniformity is something more 1 Twelve.

The highest and best teachi ng must always approximate to this, and therefore present a considerable amount of sim ilarit y when we strip it of all merely fortuitous differences in the modes of its presentation. The Ancient Wisdom provides an actual basis for this parallelism by disclosing the existence of a hierarchy of initia tes and Adepts, who preserve from age to age and re-deliver the esoteric teachi ngs which otherwise might have been entirely lost. The Keepers of the Sacred l.ight There are several considerations which would point to the existence of such a hierarchy and to its being the original source from which all great teachers have derived their knowledge. The theory that there docs exist a unifying truth, an esoteric knowledge or Theosophia, within the reach of every member of the human race, its attainment being the natural goal of his development, carries with it the idea that such relatively secret knowledge must have its living repre sentatives. \"The Secret Doctrine (or Theosophy) is the accumul ated wisdom of the ages and its cosm ogony alone is the most stupendous and elabor ate of all systems - the facts which have actually occupied countless generations of initiated seers and prophets to marshall, set down and explain - are all recorded on a few pages of geometrical signs and glyphs.

This theme, as previously stated, is that certain of these teachi ngs, if thoroughly grasped, can prove to be sources of magical power. To preserve and convey this power- giving knowledge a peculiar language was invented by its discoverers. By means of pseudo­ history, allegory and symbol this information is at the same time both revealed and concealed. Man's unawareness of spiritual and occult teachings is due, however not only to their protective con­ cealment within scripture and mythology, but also to his lack of interest in them. Humanity at this phase of its evolution is, not unnatura lly, more interested in the material world, its pleasures and rewards than in the quest for mtcrior enlightenment, the attain­ ment of which, it may be added, demands a meas 11re of renuncia­ tion. Blood sports, racing, gambling, indulgence in alcohol and sex, and the attain ment of money and power, tend to absorb man's interest, inevitably leaving little room in his mind for the higher culture and for aspiration to spiritual unfoldment. When, however, a person seriously turns from worldly things to a real quest for knowledge, that knowledge is always to be found. Even then full perception cannot be reacAed without due preparatio n. Just as one cannot take electricity out of the air and immediately use it, so spiritual enlightenment dBmands self-educa­ tion and trainiug before it can be discovered, harnBssed and usecl. While certain aspects of occult lore are admittedly reserved bB­ causc they are a source of great power which could be harmfully employed, the majority of men remain uninformed bocause they have neither seriously sought spiritual understanding nor provecl ready to undergo the training necessary for its attainment. In order more fully to understand the reasons for the universal practice of veiling certain ideas in allegory and symbol, it is neces­ sary to know both the true nature of man and his capabilities. Concerning human nature, the apostle Paul's definition conforms 1 The Secret Doctrine, H. P. Blavatsky. (Vol. I, Adyat Ed., p.

He then becomes endowed with superhuman powers, inclucling those of almost irresistible will, supersensory faculties and super­ normal physical capacities. Used for the benefit of his fellow-m en, these can be of value. Misused for personal or national gain at the cost of others, they can be extremely harmful. A wonderful possibility and a very grave danger are, however, associated with these enhanced powers . The possibility is that man may use them to gain still greater knowledge which can be placed at the service of his fellow-men. The danger is that, bliRded by egoism and a passion for dominatio n, he may be tempted to use his increased faculties for destru ctive purposes. In order that the danger may be reduced to a minimum and the power-giving knowledge be pre­ served and made available to mankind, it is formulated and delivered in a very ancient language composed of allegory, parable, imagery and symbol.

Theosophia is 11-inclusive and some of its more universal ideas are presented 1ter in this work, more particularly in the chapter on the parable •f the Prodigal Son. Full knowledge of man himself, his complete lllatomy, is contained within the age-<Jld teachings, together with a rery practical philosophy of life consistent with the scientific nethod of thought and - all-important - a description of the neans whereby that knowledge may become direct, personal :xperience. The ancient sages taught, and their successors still teach, that nan is sev enfold in his make-up, being a threefold immonal, ;piritual being incarnated in four monal, material bodi es.

In their vesture of light these three Aspects of the divine in man are called severally his individuality, his inner Self or spiri· mal Soul and, more technically, the Ego2 in the causal body. The pertinent tea ching concer ning both the Deity and man is that they are threefold. God the Trinity reproduces himself as the threefold Spiritual Self or Soul of every human being . The apostle Paul states this truth more plainly, perhaps, than any other Biblical writer in such utterances as: \" ... ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God . . . \"9 and \" •.. know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? ... therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.\" 4 Directly stated, Man-spirit and God-spirit are one spirit.

As has already been stated, since this tremendous power is susceptible of misuse the true and full signific ance of such state­ ments was .veiled by the ancient writers . One outstanding example is the story of the stilling of the tempest by the hitherto sleeping Jesus Christ, who p ersonifies God's Spirit and presence within man.1 In this spiritual aspect of his nature, man - sometimes called the microcosm - is regarded as one with the Divine, the macrbcosm. That Supreme Spirit, who is the \"immortal and eternal god who forever reigneth serene above the water floods\", and the Spirit of man are one spirit. In Hinduism, because of its paramount importance this truth is referred to as the sovereign secret, or the royal secret. The Deity is neither external to nor different from man. God and man are one and indivisible through­ out all eternity. This is the supreme truth taught directly in all mystery schools and in the esoteric aspects of all religions. In Hinduism the spirit in man is described as \"the Inner Ruler Im­ mortal seated in the heart of all beings\", \"the one Godhead hidden in all creatures, the Inmost Soul of all.\" In Christianity the Deity in man is the \"Christ in you, the hope of glory\",� the \"God which worketh in you \" , 8 the living God for which the body is a temple.

The distinction between the Logos of a universe and the Deity in man lies neither in their location nor in their essential nature, but only in the degree in which their triune powers are made mani­ fest. In God these are manifested fully, but in man in a gradually increasing degree of fullness as his evolution proceeds. Ultim ately the inherent divine powers will be fully expressed by the Spiritual Self of every man, as they are now by the Deity. In this teaching the destiny of man is revealed: he is a Gad-in-the-becoming, a pilgrim God.

Man's four more densely material vehicles - sometimes re­ ferred to as the lower quaternary - in the order of their deepening density are the mental, the emotional, the etheric and the physical bodies. The mental body, the most tenuous of the four, is com­ posed of mental ma:tter or mind-stuff and this is his vehicle of analytical, logical thought. The emotional body, man's vehicle of feeling and desire, is composed of material which is denser than mind-s tuff but finer than the physical ether. The vital or etheric body is composed of etheric substance which is finer than the gaseous, and functions as the conserving principle of his bodily vital forces and the connecting link between the superphysical and physical bodies. The corporeal body is composed of solid, liquid and gaseous materials and is his vehicle of self-expression in the physical world, his densest, heaviest instrument of awareness and action. Man's seven bodies, compris ing the Higher Triad and the lower quaternary, all occupy the same space, the finer inter­ penetrating and extending as an aura beyond the denser.

The powers and intelligences associated with the seven planes of nature, the planets and the twelve signs of the zodiac, can be evoked and employed for constructive or destructive purposes by the man who possesses this key of the septenary consti­ tution of universe and man. For this and other reasons such power· bestowing knowledge, though partly conveyed. is heavily veiled in world scriptures and mythologies. In many of them the seve n principles of man are personified by dramatis personae who display their typical attributes, as is indicated later in the present and also in succeeding volumes of this work. Spiritual KnOUJledge Lost and Regained When man's consciousness is limited to the fourfold mortal aspect of himself, he is tempor arily unconscious of both his divine nature and his unity with God. When limited to brain conscious­ ness, he may be said to suffer from spiritual \"amnesia\". This forgetf ulness can be overcome by arousing into activity and directing into the brain a certain electro-vital power resident in the physical body of man. This tremen dous force is already partly active, being the source of nerve energy and of the procreative impulse and power. When more fully aroused, sublimated and directed into the heart and the head, it greatly heightens the speed of the vibratory frequency of the cells and the organs of the brain - electrifies them, in fact. Thereafter, the man thus sensitized becomes aware that he is a spiritual being endowed with divine powers. Because this force follows undulating path­ ways in its ascent along the spinal cord from the sacrum to the brain, it is sometimes referred to as \"the serpent fire\". Its potency is so great, however, that in many ancient Scriptures it is only referred to under a protective veil of such symbols as serpents, dragons, hydras and other dangerous reptiles. For the same reason, knowledge of the method of its premature awakening is also protectively concealed in allegories of the conquest of serpents by saviors and heroes."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"THE AGELESS WISDOM 6S As man's evolution proceeds the .serpent fire is natur ally awakened, thereby assisting him to recover the lost knowledge of his own divinity and of his unity with God.

Life in a physical body is essential to this attainment. The Spiritual Self of man is like a seed, in that it contains the potentiality of the parent plant, which is God. This seed is \"sown\" or born on earth, puts forth shoots, stems and leaves, and eventually it flowers. The resultant human individuality in its four vehicles is strengthened by the winds of advers ity, purified and refined by the rain of sorrow, beautified and expanded by the sunshine of happiness and love, and ultimately reaches the fully flowered state. Just as in seeds all parental powers are inherent, so in the Monads of men all divine powers are potentially present from the beginning. The experiences of life, combined with the interior evolutionary impulse, bring these inherent powers to increas ing fullness and perfec tion of expression. All experience is valuable; nothing is wasted. Life is truly educative. Egoic un­ foldment and bodily develop ment proceed simulta neously, inner evolution being accompanied by the outer development of the four mortal bodies. Here theosophical teaching becomes eminently practical, for when this all-important knowledge of the pmpose of human life is gained and accepted the intelligent man co-ope rates, and in such co-operation with the divine plan resides the whole secret of human happiness. To what heights, then, does humanity ultimately attain?

The Ageless Wisdom affirms that the attainment of this culmi­ nation of human development is absolutely certain for every man. The command: \"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect\", 2 will be literally obeyed by the Spiritual Self of all human beings.

The evolutionary process is itself everlasting, being without conceivable beginning or imaginable end. Beyond human perfec­ tion is a still higher attain ment reached during passage through the superhuman kingdoms of nature, followed by a general ascent towards the spiritual stature of the Logos of a universe. Beyond that again progress continues towards the highest possible degree of unfoldment attainable at the end of a major cosmic period of manifes tation. Even then, at the succeeding re-emergence of cosmos from chaos, of activity from quiescence, development will continue from the point previously attained and proceed to still greater heights. Perf ection is thus hardly the best word, since it suggests finality. Actually it is only attained in a relative sense, for it must give room to still further perfec tion, according to a higher standard of excell ence in the following period of activity -just as a perfect flower must cease to be a perfect flower and die in order to grow into a perfect fruit, if such a mode of expr ession may be permitted.� Man is an evolving spiritual being and will one day become as God now is.

How is this state of Adeptship attained? It is a natural result of evolutionary progress and is achieved by means of successive incarnations in material vehicles, newly-fo rmed during the pre-natal period of each succeeding life. Repeated reincarnat ions in physical bodies provide the necessary time and opportunity for such attain­ ment. The multifarious experianCGs thus passed through draw out the latent powers of the evolving Spiritual Soul, which is the true man.

All further progress can then be achieved in the superphysical worlds. This is stated in the Book of Revelation in the following words : \"Him that over cometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out ... \"1 \"Whatsoever a Man Soweth , That Shall He Also Reap\"s All reincarnations are connected with each other by the op­ eration of the Jaw of cause and effec t. Under this law all actions, feelings and thoughts produce their own natural and perfectly appropriate reactions, which may follow the causative actions immediately, later in the same life, or in succeeding incarnations. It is referred to in many places in the Bible, Paul's statement being: \" ... God is not mock ed: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.\" The Sanskrit word karma (action) is used to designate this Jaw, its operation and the effects it produces. Under its working, actions motivated by ,Iove, service and un­ selfishness produce pleasure and a growing freedom of self-ex­ pression, which encourage the actor to repeat them. On the other hand actions motivated by dislike, greed and selfishness produce pain and an increasing limitation of self-express ion, which dis­ courage the actor from repeating them. Furthermore, the intensity of pleasure or pain is governed by the degree in which unselfish and selfish motives find expression in action. This balanced com­ pensation is affirmed in the words of the Lord Chr ist: \"Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.\"3 Human suffering is thus seen to be neither a retribution im­ posed by the Deity, a punishment inflicted from abov e, nor an unjust, accidental adversity. On the contrary all pain is self­ inflicted, and therefore justly received. It is, moreover, designed to apprise the actor of his transgres sion. Suffering is th us seen to be both just and truly beneficent, because educative in its ulti­ mate effect.

All human conditions - suff ering, disease, happiness and health - are self-cre ated under law. The problem presented by the birth of babies which are malformed or diseased is solved when the sequence of cause and effect is recognized as operating throughout a series of lives. While such afflictions seem on the surface to be completely unjust because unearned, and so undeserved, they are not really so. They are, in fact, the strictly appropriate effects of causes generated by the same Ego in former lives. Without this explanation life is, indeed, a hopeless riddle defying solution. The twin doctrines of reincarna­ tion and karma throw a flood of light upon human life, revealing the existence of justice, purpose, and an assured goal for all men. Man Can Master Circum.sla nces The principle needs to be advanced here of the modification of karma by intervening actions performed before causes have had time to produce their full effects. Whatever one's actions in the past - good or bad in varying degrees - the reactions which they produce are not to be regarded as an inescapable fate, or as a dead weight from which there is no relief. Both individuals and nations by their subsequent actions are constantly modifying the operation of the law upon themselves. Thus, neither individuals nor nations are paralyzed by their p ast actions. Everything is not irretrievably fated. Man can master circumstances and make of each experience an oppor tunity for a fresh begin ning, however heavily the past may weigh upon him. He can pass from the grip of the law by learning to work with it. Civil law is an enemy to the criminal because it restrains him, restricting the expression of his criminal tendencies. To the good citizen, however, the same Jaw is an assurance of security; it is not an enemy but a friend, not a source of restriction but a preserver of freedom. This is also true of the universal law of cause and effect. To selfish, lawless and cruel people it brings nemesis, retribution in the form of a reaction appropriate to every pain­ producing action. To unselfish, law-abiding, kindly people the law brings health, happiness and freed om.1 Furthermore, every such 1 For a fuOcr cxpo •ition of this subject and tor further Blbllcol texla, eee RnnciUIIIJ· lion, Fa<l or Fallacy7, Grol!tey HodeoD."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"72 THE HIDDEN WISDOM IN THE HOLY BIBLE helpful action performed before the effects of selfish action have had time to be precipitated reduces, and may even neutralize, oncoming adversities. Such, briefly, is the pr inciple of the modifica­ tion of human karma. There is thus a spiritual alchemy by means of which adversity resulting from actions motivated by selfi shness can be diminished, or even nullified. This is achieved by self­ purification, self-discipline, and the enactment of deeds motivated by univer sal, non-possessive love. The Pathway to Peace Such a mode of life partly constitutes \"The way of holiness\" and the \"narrow way\" of Christianity, the \"Noble Eightfold Path\" of Buddhism and the \"Razor-edged Path\" of Hinduism. The Christ said: \"Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat : Because strait is the gate, and narr ow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.\"1 This way of life leads to a quickening of evolutionary progress and the development in advance of the normal time of super­ normal facult ies, including spiritual intuitiveness and thaumaturgic powers. It also leads to discipleship of an adept teacher, and thence through successive initiations to salvation or perfection, nirvana, moksha or liberatio n.2 The lives of Christ and his disciples, as well as of other great teachers, may be regarded as dramatic representations of the ex­ periences of the soul on this path. The teachings of the Lord Christ, particularly those in the Sermon on the Molint, of the Lord Buddha concerning the Noble Eightfol d Path and its appli­ cations to the spiritual life, and of the Lord Shri Krishna as re­ corded in the Bhagavad Gita, indicate the motives and the conduct necessary for this attainment. The Noble Eightfold Path was defined by the Lord Buddha as consisting of: \"Right Belief, Right Thought, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Means of Livelihood, Right Exertion, Right Remembrance, Right Meditation or Rapture.\" This path - noble 1 Mall. 7:13· 14. !

Success in finding and treading it demands purity of life, selfless service and an un­ conquerable will. This group of ideas may briefly be summed up as follows : - Man is essentially a s p iritual being, his mind and his body being only temporary means of self-expression and self-un­ foldment. When this true Self is discovered and becomes the directing power, the re is permanent peace for the individual and for the race. Without that discovery peace is impossible. The search for aod the discovery of the Self is therefore of supreme importance. The evolution of the Spiritual Self to perfection through successive Jives on earth is the true purpose of human ex­ istence. Man's experien ces are decided by the operation of the law of cause and effect. Cruelty brings war to nations and pain and disease to individuals. There is no possible escape frem this sequence. Inversely, kindness brings happiness and health. Until this law is recognized and accepted as a rule of life, there will continue to be both war and disease. The spirit within all men is one spirit. Each man belongs to one spiritual race which is without divisions of any kind. Experience of this unity, and its applications to human life, constitute the only possible means whereby lasting peace can be established on earth and assured health and happiness be attained by every human being. Such, in part, are th e teachings of the wisdom of the ages concerning man. Such is the pathway to health, happiness, per­ fection and eternal peace. Theosophy must not, hewever, be re­ garded as a completed system to be accepted as such.

They used history only as weft and warp on which to weave a representation of ever­ lasting verities, the esoteric wisdom of all ages, the deeply occult knowledge of the initiates of the mystery schools of both ancient and more modern days. Time and the world of time were of far less importa nce to these inspired authors than eternity and the eternal truths of which they wrote. When we open our Bible, then, we should remember that we are reading a special category of literature, foreign to us at first. In order to discover the intention of the authors we need to learn the meaning of the words, to understand the method of writing and to possess the keys of interpr etation. We must, indeed, find a Rosetta stone. Then, as we Jearn to lift the veil of allegory, symbol, imagery, and even incongruity, the light of truth will illumin e our minds. The Theme of Cyclic Forlhgoing and Return The Bible is found to be capable of many interpretations, wisdom being concealed within it layer upon layer. The outer layer is pseudo-history, local and temporal. The inner layers consist of universal, eternal truths. Among the earliest races there moved men and women who were not less informed than our­ selves concernin g the mysteries of life, but more so. They had been drawn near to the adept teachers of the race and had been received by them as initiates of the greater mysteries. These are the inspired authors of the world's Scriptures, cosmogo nical and occult legends, and myths. They saw outer, temporal events, beings and things as mirrors of eternal verities. Egyptian practice may provide us with an illustration. In that country the scarab beetle' was intimately associated with the creative Deity, one of whose titles was Khcpcra. Why this association of a Jowly insect with the creative Lord of all? The life habits of the scarab suggest an answer. This beetle encloses its egg, its seed of life, in a ball of mud, rolls the ball to a sunny spot and leaves it to the warming, hatching influence of the sun. Ultimately the egg hatches and 1 It was also a symbol of resurrection anO reiDCa rnation."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"SOME KEYS OF INTERPRETATION 77 brings forth a larva, which finds itself surrou nded by its necessary food. Consuming this, it passes through its transformations and ultimately emerges as t:hc winged scarab, to become in its tum a parent of further eggs. The creative Logos produces from within himself the seed­ thought of the univer se-to-be. This is sometimes descr ibed as the golden egg, or the egg of Brahma. This dynamic, archetypal idea is brought into association with pre-cosmic matter, or the virgin se a of space, just as the scarab's egg is deposited in the mud. The next step in the creative process is the operation of cyclic law. The major cycle of forthgoing and return, with its innumerable sub-cycles, is not inaptly represented by the scarab's action of forming the ball of mud and rolling it to a sunny spot. As the larva finds itself surrounded with the essential sources of nutri­ tion, so are all living beings provided at all levels with both interior sustaining life and the external food which nature supplies. Similarly, as the larva passes through its metamorphosis to be­ come winged and free of the limitations of its ball of mud, so does the Soul of man become gradually transformed from the matter­ blinded state to the spiritually illumined one. The physical body entombs him no more. He can leave and retu rn to it at wilt without a break in consciou sness. He is winged, free. Observing the natural habits of the scarab beetle, the ancient Egyptians saw in them a phys ical example of both tmmorta lity, or resurrect ion, and the universal law of cyclic progres sion. In the same manner as the newly formed scarab becom es, in its turn, a parent setting in motion the same cyclic procedure, so docs the Soul of maD. descend again and again into incarn ation, become bom in a physical body, shake off that chrysalis at death and withdraw to his Source. Thus, indeed, the scarab beetle does display the attri­ butes and actions of both the Supreme Creative Cause and the Spiritual Soul of man. Innumerable natural objects and things were similarly in­ corporated by the inspired authors of the past into their supposad historical accounts of local, planetary and celestial events. The sacred language was thus used to write history, allegory and myth in such a way that eternal truth was both concealed and revealed."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"78 THE HIDDEN WISDOM IN THE HOLY BIBLE Bondage and Exodus What is the central idea, the one plot, of the same great story which is at the heart of every inspired allegory? It is the story of manif ested life (the macrocosmic Prodigal Son), of its emanation from its spiritual Source (the Father's home ), and of its forth­ going or descent on its involution ary journey deeper and deeper into the material, evolutionary field where it becomes clothed, im­ prisoned, entombed, in vehicles of increasing density until the densest level (eating of the husks which the swine did eat) is reached. In our solar system, as far as we know, the densest matter is that of the mineral kingdom of nature (the pit in the earth into which Joseph was lowered, bondage in Egypt, and the rock tomb of the Christ ). After burial there for a time, life wins free from its densest encasement and thereafter gradually ascends on the evolutionary pathway back to its Source (\"I will arise\", the raising of Joseph, the Exodus, and the Resurrection of Christ ). The result of this cyclic pilgrim age, with its innumerable com­ ponent sub-cycles, is the germination of the seeds of the deific potencies locked up in the units of universal spirit-life known as the Monads, the immortal germs. Component Cycles The major cycle of forthgoing and return is comprised of innumerable minor cycles of decreasing dimension, as if wire were twisted round a spirally arranged wire, the surrounding wire being in i ts tum surrounded by other spiral coils, and so on almost ad infinitum. Every component round of a spiral repeats in miniature the processes, procedures, difliculties and attainments typical of cycles of larger dimensions. Periodi cally a number of cycles and sub-cycles - or arcs of cycles and sub-cycles - con­ verge and culminate together. Major historical events frequently occur at such convergences. Crises in the lives of individua ls are often precipitated at the time of such coincidences of cycles and sub-cycles. The predictions of advanced occultists are based upon knowledge of these phenomena. The microcosm is ever a reproduc­ tion, and repet ition in miniature, of the macrocosm.

Lord Leighton's well-known picture, ''The Return of Perse­ phone\", portrays the reunion of mother and child. The entrance to the underworld is shown as a cave. The god Hermes, with his caduceus or staff formed of a central rod and two intertwined serpents, is bearing Persephone to the upper air from below. At the entrance to the cave is her mother, Ceres, into whose arms he will deliver her daughter. This allegory has numerous meanings. In one interpretation Ceres is the goddess of nature and agriculture and Persephone is the plant life, or product of nature, which sleeps below the ground during the winter. In spring the resurgent life-force -Persephone and Hermes together - brings forth and gives vitality to the new vegetation. This grows and its fruits ripen throughout the summer, after which activity in the plant kingdom begins to die down, ceasing almost completely at the onset of winter. Allegorically, Persephone descends to the underworld to become the enforced bride of Pluto, King of Hades - the personification of matter, the physical world and body and life therein, and the dark period of any cycle. The story goes on to say that Pluto agreed to give up Perse­ phone, and Zeus agreed that she should be completely freed and returned to her mother, but only on condition that she had not eaten any food while in the underworld. Unfortunately she had eaten some pomegra nate seeds, an action which made her subject to nature and to the earth. It was therefore decided that she should spend one-quarter of each year in the underworld as the bride of Pluto, and that for the rest of the time she would be reunited with her mother. Such is one interpretation in which the story is re­ ganleu as an allegory of nature's processes, Persephone represent­ ing the life-force in natu re, Hermes the power of reproduction and growth, Ceres the source of that life, and Zeus the Lord of the Universe."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"SOME KEYS OF INTERPR ETATION 81 A solar alle g o ry is also unfolded, the p e ri o d spent under­ ground in Hades being the w i n t ertim e in the No rth e r n H e m i sp he r e , when the sun lacks power for some three to four months of the y e a r , th er e aft e r r i s i n g to shine in the midst of the heavens.

Hermes with his staff has then allegorically liberated Persephone from the unde rworld. At the command of Zeus (the Monad) and with the submission of Pluto (the now-disciplined body elemental con­ sciousness ), Persephone (the personal Ego) is restored by Hermes (the serpent fire) to her mother (the Spiritual SeH) on Olympus (causal consciousness ). Such are some of the possible meanings of the story from the Eleusinian mysteries, of which many of those who now find themselves deeply interested in occult science may have been members; for in their outer garb the Eleusinia were public spec­ tacles, and a distinguished citizen of Athens could become an initiate of these outer or lesser mysteries. At first members merely received and enacted the symbolic glyph. As they passed from the outer or lesser to the inner or greater myste ries, allegory gave way to reality. The forces symbolized by the caduceus began to awaken as the hierophant touched the initiate with the great wand of power, the thyrsus . This culm inated in his being freed from the body which, becoming unconscious and entranced, was placed in the care of the priests. The freed initiate Soul, symbolized by Persephone, could then ascend to the state of egoic consciousness or become one with Ceres, its goddess mother. The caduceus has another meaning. That already given is its possible dynamic significance, but in addition it has a kind of moral meaning, as have all symbols. The two serpents represent also the pairs of opposites, such as success and failure, heat and cold, pleasure and pain, happiness and despair, love and hate, health and disease, presence and absence, activity and inertia. Before the Soul can be pedected and fully liberated it must have become equipoised in consciousness betw een all the pairs, being equally indifferent to either of their components.

As one studies the scrip tures of the world, therefore, one must read intuitively, sensitively, with one's mind open and re sponsive to that vaster consciousness which so often seems wait­ ing to burst through. Thus the First Key is that some recorded events also occur interiorly. P e ople Personify Human Qualities The Second Key is that each of the persons introduced into the stories represents a condition of consciousness and a quality of charact�r.

When the hero is semi-divine, however, the accent is upon the hastened progress of the Spiritual Self in man after it hali begun to assume preponderant power. When the cen­ tral figure is an Av atar or \"descent\" of an aspect of Deity, his experiences narrate those of the Spiritual Self during the last phases of human evolution to the stature of pcdectcd manhood. Such is the general purpose, and such the method, of the ancient writers of the world's immortal allegories, parables and myths. The Deity or Father, when introduced into a narrative, gen­ erally refers to the Highest Spiritual Essence in man, the Divine Spark, the Immortal Germ, the Logos of the Soul, the Dweller in the Innermost, the Monad. This is especially true where the Su­ preme and Eternal Deity, the Logos, is brought into the story. A tragic, mind- darkening degradation of the Universal Self named \"I AM THAT 1 AM,\"1 to the level of the deity of a single tribe, sometimes bloodthirsty, wrathful and jealous, is thought by some authorit ies to have been made in the days of the restora tion by Ezra of the destroyed books of the Israelit es. The Supreme Emanator, referred to as \"God\" and \"the Spirit of God,\"2 is above all thing s universal and divine. The limitation of the one uncreate to become the personal god of a single tribe had led to much confusion and an appalling debasement of the idea of the Supreme Deity. When­ ever the Eternal One is introduced into a narrative, it is always susceptible of interpr etation as a personification of the Monad of m an , as also of the Oversoul of the race. In the parable, the bosom of Abraham3 into which Lazarus, \"a certain beggar,\" was carried by the angels, refers to the state of consciousness in which the human Monad perpetually abide s and to which the Spiritual Soul or Immortal Ego eventually attain s. Those following the initiatory path seek to hasten this realization, in wakin g brain-consciousness, first of their divine, immortal na­ ture, and thereafter of their unbroken unity with the Supreme Lord of all. The full recognition of man's unity with God, of the oneness of man-spirit with God-spirit, is the ultimate goal of all who seek lE :<. 3: 14. ll G•n.

In Hinduism this state is called moksha or liberation; in Buddhism, nirvana or con­ scious absorption; and in Chris·tianity, salvation, ascension, Christ­ hood, and being \"carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom.\" The symbol of the disciple John leaning on th e boso m of Jesus1 is suscaptible of a similar interpretation. Thus Abraham, as also many other people in the Biele, personates both a principle of man and a state of consciousness. In this method of Biblical study the characte rs- divine, semi­ divine, patriarchal and human - are regarded as personifications of princ iples and powers of na t u r e as the macrocosm and of man as the micr ocosm. This reading is supported by Paul, who writes: \" ... all these things happened unto them for ensam ples\"2 and \" •.. it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bond­ maid, the other by a frccwoman ... which things are an alle­ gory . .. \"8 It is not unreasonable to ass1:1me that such a theory may also be true of many other portions of the Bible. One may even go further than this and assert that the practice of studying the scriptures of the world in th6ir literal meaning, and as records of actual historical events alone, can lead to serious confusion of mind. Three other errors in modern Christianity urgently need to be corrected, I submit. These are: the degradation already men­ tioned, of the concept of the Divine Emanator of the aniverse to the level of a tribal god; 4 reliance upon an external (instead of an interior ) redemptive power; and t h e erection of a theological edi­ fice founded upon incredible dogmas concerning this last error, the author of Proverbs would seem to have expressed a view similar to that wh·ich fonns the basis of this work, namuly that many of the scriptural passages upon which certain dogmas are founded were actually conceived and written as allegories or parables. These difficulties are all avoided, and profound inspiration consistent with reason is gained by the recognition of a mystical 1 Jn. 13:23. 2 I Cor. 10: II. 8 Gal. 4:22·24. 4 Exoteric Hebraism alone presents this view of Jehovah.

Thus the humility, the devotion and the selfless love of Mary, the Mother of Jesus; the human frailty and the inherent sainthood of a Magdalene and a P�ter; the \"busyness\" of Martha and the far more valuable, spiritual, contemplative aspects of human nature and modes of human life displayed by her sister, Mary - all these attributes form part of the character of every individual, the conditions of life drawing out now one and now another. The twelve disciples of Jesus personify them in a twelvefold classification as microcosmic manifestations of the attributes of the zodiacal signs. Discipleship, or nearness to the divine teacher, indicates that the evolution of the disciple had reached an advanced stage. Ultimately, all attributes will be fully developed as powers of heart and mind and spirit. Only as the twelve zodiacal qualities in man are \"disci pled\" - or disciplined and refined - is he able to respond to his own inner spiritual will and to comprehend pure wisdom, both of which arc personified by the Master. The Christ-Presence and power, whether asleep, awakenin g or being \"born\", or fully grown to \"the measure of the stature of the full­ ness of Christ\"/ must, however, be added to all human attributes in order to complete by means of personification the full descrip­ tion of man. The interaction between these various aspects of human nature, the effects t h e y produce upon one another, the w ax i ng or waning of one or more of them at different times and in different lives, and the gradual, triumphant emergence and predominance of the royal Spiritual Self, the immortal King within, the hero of every saga- all this is allegorica lly portrayed by the initiated authors of the scriptures of the world. The marriages in which many of these exploits culminate may be interpreted as symbolic references to the unification of the consciousness of the outer and the inner Self. In mystical literature they are therefore referred to as \"heavenly marriage s.\" Thus the narratives themselves describe the experiences -particularly the tests, ordeals, defeats and vic­ tories - of one person, who is man himself.

In the main, the mani fold experiences of the immortal Sc!H of man in its journey toward perfec tion are narrated as the adventures of numbers of persons in any one story. The twelve labors of Hercules, each susceptible of association with one of the twelve signs of the Zodiac, the voyage of the Argonauts, the journeys and experiences of the Israelites, the lives of the Lord Shri Krishna and of the Lord Christ, among many others, are aU descriptive in the symbolic manner of the journey of the Soul and the psychological, intellectual and spiritual experiences passed through on that journey. Thus the Second Key is that each of the dramatis perso nae represents a condition of consciousness and a quality of character. Stories Dramatize Phases of Human E\"olution The Third Key is that each story is thus regarded as a graphic description of the experiences of the human soul as it passes through the various phases of its evolutionary journey to the Promised Land, or cosmic consciousness - the goal and summit of human attainment. Inspired allegories are always distinguish­ able from mere novels and biogr aphies by several characteristics, such as the intrusion of the super natural and the inclusion in the story of angelic and divine beings, and even of Deity itseH. When these arc found the existence of a hidden revelation may always be suspect ed. The reader possessed of the keys may then penetrate the veil of symbolism and find that hidden wisdom wh i c h it had concealed. In this third method of interpretation each story may be studied from at least two points of view. The first of these refers to normal evolutionary experience and natural mental and emo­ tional states, while the secon.d poi.n.t of view reveals the sacred allegories as more especially descri ptive of the experiences of those who enter in at the strait gate and pursue the narrow way .1 1 Mall. 7:13 -14."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"90 THE HIDDEN WISDOM IN THE HOLY BIDLE In the parable of the sower1 the diff erent conditions of the ground - as the Christ e x pl a i n ed privately to his disciples2 - represent various evolutionary phases and states of spiritual recep­ tiveness of the race and the individual, from complete unrespon­ siveness (rocky ground) to full perception and ratification (fertile ground ). In the p a r abl e of the t e n virgins,3 the foolish ones may be regarded as th os e who are not as yet sufficiently evolved to be able to respond to impulses descending from t h eH i gh er Self (the bridegr oom), and therefore not really to be blamed. The wise virgins, on the other hand, may be i n terpre t e d as personifying all those in whom the Spiritual Self has attained to a considerable degree of evolutionary unfoldment and the outer, physical nature is sufficie ntly d e v e lo p ed to be aware of this fact and to give expression, in the condu ct of daily life, to the higher idealism and the fruits of spiritual e x p e ri e nc e s . This is followed by the progres­ sive illumination of the mind-brain by the Ego (betrothal ), lead­ ing to the fusion of the immortal and mortal natures (marriage ). The incidents of the marriage feast of Cana4 may thus be take n to refer to this interior union achieved by those who have awakened the power of the Christ- presence within them, allegori­ cally indicated by the presence of th e Master. The all-essential blending of personality and Ego, the \"heavenly marriage\" or merging of the human individu ality with the One Divine Self and Life of the universe as a whole, \"the mystic identity,\" has be en attained. The presence of the Christ in this story, as in all in which he appears, including those which describe the miracles, indicates that spiritual wisdom, spiritual intuitiveness and a Christ­ like love and compassion are already well developed and active throughout the personal nature. Under such conditions the \"water'', symbol of the desire aspects of the emotions, automatically becomes transmuted into the \"wine\" of spiritual wisdom. This is not a m ira c le , but a natural process which occurs when a steadfast aspirant finds and treads the narrow way.

Thus the Third Key is that many scriptural stories allegorically describe phases of man's evolutionary journey and their accompanying experiences. The Symbolis m of Language The Fourth Key is that some physical objects, as also certain words, have each their own special symbolic meaning. \"The sacred language of the initiates of the mystery schools of old is indeed formed of hierogram s and symbols rather than of words alone, their meaning being ever constant, as constant. also is the doctrine which this language everywhere reveals. Words are thus used as keys with which to unlock the inner meanings of scripture and mythology. These keys, when turned seven times, will reveal seven layers of sacred wisdom. This fact is allego rically referred to on many occasions. The fiery furnace for example had to be heated \"seven times more than it was wont to be heated\"1 before the three men - Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego - were joined by a fourth who appeared \"like the Son of God\".2 Similarly, the walls of Jericho were circumambulated on the seventh day seven times before they fell down.3 This Fo urth Key receives fuller con­ sideration in the first chapter of Part III. The idea thus emerges that in order to discover the sacred wisdom of the Christian and other scriptures we must divest our­ s elves of the idea that they were conceived and written entirel y as chronologically and historically accurate accounts of actual events. The Gospel narrative, for example, in its initiatory• interpretation, describes the progress of an advanced and elevated Soul through the final ascending phases of evolution until the highest, the Ascen­ sion, is attained. To be fully appreciated the great drama must be transferred from the material to the psycho logical, intellectual and spiritual realms and levels of human experience.

Though still imperfect, they are becoming increasingly spiritualized, or brought into the presence of their Master, who personates the dweller in the innermost, the God-self of man. The disciples are not yet equal to the Christ, being younger in evolu­ tion and in consequence still under the delusion of self-separateness. This is shown by their question as to w h o will be greatest in the kingdom of heaven.1 They are still tainted by grosser material attributes, hence the symbolical washing of their feet by their Master.2 A traitor still lurks in their midst, who must be self­ revealed and self-slain befor e the great Ascension can occur. The Master aclmonishes, rebukes ancl warns them, indicating the spiritual izing activity of the divine presence within. By the exercise of theurgic powers many of the recorded - and miscalled - miracles could have been performed by an Adept, or even by an initiate of lesser degr ee. In possible mystical inter­ pretations they also illustrate the processes of arousing into activity the faculty of responsiveness to spiritual vision (restoring sight), and to the still, small voice within (restoring hearin g), the free exercise of the intellect liberated from rigid orthodoxy (curing those paralyzed ) and awakening to full spiritual awareness and knowledge (raising from the dead ). This method of interpretati on will be employed in those later volumes of this work in which the New Testament miracles of the Lord Christ are considered.

These are later referred to in the text of this book by their Sanskrit names of Manvan tara and Pralaya respectively. With reference to (f). Joshua personifies the initiate who has brought his monadic will, symbolized by the sun, to its position of maximum power (the midst of the heavens or zenith ). In con­ sequence, he prevents the oncoming of night (mental darkness ) am:l maintains his personal nature (the battlefield of Gibe on) i-n tha·t cond- ition of prolonged illumination (day) which insures victory in the battle between spirit (the Israelites ) and matter (their cnamies ) in him. This wonderful allegory has been more fully considered in Part I, Chapter V. Even from this brief interpretation, however, the element of impossi bility may be re­ garded as both a hint or clue and an indication of a profound occult idea for which the reader is encouraged to search. With regard to (m), quite clearly our Lord was not exhorting mankind to consume human flesh and blood when he said: \"Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day. For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink iFldeed. He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him. As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Fath er: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.\"1 The words \"flesh\", \"blood\", \"eateth\" and \"drinketh\" are not used in the usual sense. They are symb olical, metaphorical, and are so used in order to convey a hidden under­ meaning. What, then, do those four words - \"flesh\", \"blood\", \"eateth\" and \"drinketh\" mean? The flesh of Christ may be interpreted as divine truths, spiritual laws, or that in which he is clothed, by which he is covered and through which he as Logos is made manifest. The time comes - and is hastened as \"The way of holiness\" is entered upon - when the human intellect absorbs divine knowledge, becomes illumined and inspired by the interior discovery and revelation of spiritual truths.

Eating consecrated bread is an allegory for the recep­ tion, absorption and application to life of that knowledge, gnosis, sophia, esoteric wisdom. Bread is also a symbol of the cyclic re­ generation of life after each return to the seed state. The blood of Christ is the ever-outpoured divine life by which the Universe is sustained and without which it could not live. The life-force does, indeed, perform a function for the universe and all it contains which closely resembles the life-sustaining office which human blood performs for the physical body. Normally man is unaware either of th e outpouring and omnipresence of this divine life, or of the fact that it is the spiritually sustaining life within him. At a certain stage of the evolution of the human intellect this fact is intuitively perceived. Such realization by the aspirant can be hastened by means of certain spirit ual practices, meditation and prayer, and by the aid of his Master the hierop hant and other officiants in the sacred initiatory rites of the temples of the Greater Mysteries. Ultima tely full knowledge may be gained of the outpouring of the Christ-life into the universe and man, and also of man's identity with that life and its divine Source. This attainment is described symbolica lly as drinking Christ's blood. Our Lord may be assumed to have been referring to a state of consciousness of unity with the cosmic Christ and his outpoured life rather than to an act of physical nutrition. Once this symbolical eating and drinking, this spiritual agape, has occurred, then the process can be initiated in others who in their turn, starving for truth, can be fed in vast multitudes. As the incident of feeding the five thousand' allegorically tells, in this ministration there is not, neither can there be, any loss.

Clouds, in one interpretatio n, represent a veiling of clear perception, or the clouding of the lower mind from the illumination or \"sunlight\" of the higher. Clouds have still other and varied significations. A white cloud symbolizes the vehicle of the Christ-co nsciousness, particularly in its aspect of intuitional illuminant to the human mind. When aspiring thought and medita­ tion are directed toward s the divinest aspects of man's nature, the realm and the vehicle of i-ntuition are penetrated, as it were, to produce a downtlow of spiritual rain, meaning intuitive perception of truth, wisdom in the conduct of affairs, and benefits derived from spiritual sources. This vehicle of intuition in itself is a sheath for the manifestation and expression at lower levels of the spiritual will, the kingly Self of man. When consciousness is exalted to the level of pure wisdom, spiritual intuitiveness and full realization of unity, sometimes symbolized by a white cloud, then the almost omnipotent power of the Will-Self of man may be discerned. Thus the author of the book of Revel ation wrote: \"And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man, having on his h e ad a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.\"' Since, however, clouds shut out the light of the sun, they are, as also suggested above, symbols of that obscurity with which the higher nature of man is regarded by the analytical mind- brain. Elemental storms generally refer to disturbed mental and emotional conditions. Still air represent1i both the higher emotions and the intuition, while rushing winds sometimes refer to disturbed menta­ emotional states. In another meaning the cloud represents that effect upon the lower vehicles produced by a special descent and manifestation of the light of the higher, which has the appearance of a luminous mist.

Ancestors, or progenitors, are symbols of preceding cycles ­ solar, planetary, racial - and of previous human incarnations; for all of these are the parents of the present dispensation, manifesta­ tion, indiv iduality and personality. In this sense the visitation of the sins of the fathers (preceding lives) upon the children (later lives) does not appear to be cruelly unjust, as it certainly does if the fifth verse of Chapter Twenty of Exodus is taken literally. Angels, when not referring directly to members of the angelic hosts, as is offen the case, refer to the highest spiritual principle of man, the Atma, and sometimes to the Monad itself. The Monad is forever at one with the Logos, and it is therefore true of all men that \" ... their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven\".' This indicates the truth that the Monad is ever in the presence of the Spiritual Source , the Supreme Lord. Animals, when predatory, refer to the desires and passions of the flesh. Their taming, or destruction, symbolizes mastery over the lower nature. This :nust be done by each individual for, and largely by, himself alone.

In consequence, a son (spiritual intuitiveness) is said to be conceived and born in the supposed old age (advanced evolu­ tionary stature) of a hitherto barren (pre-initia te) wife.2 Battles arc symbols of the conflict between spirit and matter, between the involutionary and the evolutionary impulses and pro­ cesses, between will and desire, between \"good\" and \"bad\" in humanity - racial and individual. In the symbolical language all wars refer, microcosmically, to some phase or phases of the conflict between the Monad-Ego of man and his mortal vehicles, between the ascending Self and the descending, ensouling life of the matter of which those vehicles are formed.

Fire has at least a dual significance in the sacred language. When destruc tive, it refers to the hypercritical attributes and activities of the human mind. When a source of illumination, as upon a mount or as a pillar of fire guiding through the darkness, it refers to the sublimated creative force in man, sometimes called the serpent fire, 1 by means of which the darkness of the unil­ lumined, worldly state of mind is displaced by the light of wisdom.

Throughout all successive rebirths the Ego retains the personal menlo-emotional psyche. In this sense, personal relative immortality (though not yet of the physical body ) has been attained. Death passes over these forms (houses) in which initiated Egos continue to abide. They are marked with \"the blood of the Lamb\" in the sense that the Christ-nature has been awa kened into self-conscious activity, and the Chr ist-influence and attitude to life are characteristic of the outer man.

Apart from the astrological attribution of characteristi cs ­ Christlike compassion and intuitive wisdom - to the zodiacal sign Pisces, a fish seems to have been used as a secret sign by which the early Christians could mutually identify each other during the time they were being persecuted.

In addition, symbols are then replaced by direct per­ ception of that which they typify (knowing the mystery \"face to face\", as in Christ's words to his disciples ).2 This self-unification with the eternal, omnipresent current of creative life is technically called \"entering the Stream.\" Each initia tion deepens this realiza­ tion, until at the fifth it is complete. The Adept knows himself as identical with the IUe-filling stream, the indwell ing spiritual life, which like a river flows into and vivifies every form.

To separate by magical power the waters of Jordan (or the Red Sea) into two currents, one on the right and one on the left, to carry over the Ark of the Covenant (the Israelite nation ), and to enable the people to cross dry-shod, is an allegorical method of describing certain bodily transformations, and the awakening and ascent along the spinal cord of the positive and negative currents of the serpent fire.

The stones found in the bed below the waters represent both the supernal wisdom and the utter­ most foundations upon which all creation is based. These roots of being, these truths and powers, these numbers and laws, upon and according to which the universe and man are built, are normally concealed beneath the living sub�tance of which they are composed. Matter-blinded man, the pre-initiate mind, cannot see them under ­ neath the \"flood\". Spiritually illumined man, the initiate-mind, pierces the veil, symbolically holds back the waters of Jordan and perceives and forever after knows the twelve powers, principles and truths upon which, and of which, the universe and man are built.

When spiritually directed, this mental energy elevates the center of consciousness toward the spiritual worlds just as Pegasus, the winged horse, carried his rider. When un­ restrained, the mind-impelled life-force can lead to the indulgence of the lower nature, with its passions and desires. Thus an endeavor is made by sorcerers to have the child Zoroaster trampled to death by hors es. The leading horse, however, stands over the child and preserves it from injury. A white horse is a symbol of the higher mind, illumined by intuition. The Lord Buddha, in pity for the sufferings of the world, is said to have flown across the heav ens on a white horse and entered into the regions of the demons in order to secure the happiness of mankind. The white horse is also symb olically associ­ ated with the sun, and so with the dweller in the innermost, the Monad of man. The world Savior, or King Messiah, is described as riding on a white hor se,2 h o l d i n g a bow and w e a r i n g a c r o w n . The arrow is a symbol of the fiery darts or rays of the sun which physically give life, energy and fecundity to nature. Spiritu ally interpreted it symbolizes the thrust of spirit, the fiery, electrical energy (Fohat) by which evolutionary progr ession is initiated and maintained. In man, the arrow is the will-force of the Monad which awakens the dormant intuitive faculty within the Higher Self, and supplies the drivin g energy w hich causes a man to set forth upon the great quest, like a mountaineer who risks his life in order to conquer an hitherto unknown and inviolate peak. The Avatar, or divine woi\"ld Savior, mounted upon a white horse, is thus the Christos; Vishnu among the Hindus; the Logos both of a universe and of the human soul. In the choice of a horse rather than an ass, ox, elephant or other tamed quadruped, the attribute of speed is deliberately accentuated.

Activity, controlled and inter-bal anced with rhythm and inerti a, leads to powerful and graceful motion, subject to mastery, and this condi­ tion is well portrayed by the horse.

In a kiss on the lips, emotion predominates; ilie spirit ual is implied by a kiss on the brow, over the pituitazy gland and Ajna Chakra.

The kiss of Judas is a betrayal leading to the imprisonment, the degradation, the sufferi ng, the death and the entombment of the Christ in the sense that spirit, which he personifies, is enfolded and so \"betrayed\" and imprisoned by matter, prim ordial freedom being temporarily restricted. Marriage, and intercourse, whether legal or illicit, refer not to any carnal relationship but to a spiritual \"marriage\", or blend­ ing of consciousness, at any level. The physical, waking conscious­ ness can be elevated into union with that of the inner spiritual Self. A great teacher may blend his consciousness intimately with a disciple, while at the spiritual level the Supreme Teacher of aU perpetually maintains an indissolu ble union between himself and aU beings. The symbol of marriage is thus used in two senses. One refers to the conscious unification of the divine and the human in man. The other refers to the intimate, spiritual union established between a true teacher and the Spiritual Soul of a disciple or, in the case of Our Lord, with the whole of humanity. This latter is regarded by some Christian mystics as the true atonement, which might p ossibly be written as \"at-one-ment\". Under such conditions a spiritual marriage might be said to have occurred, and thus our Lord might permissibly be regarded as the Bridegroom. Even illicit relationships may be used to indicate this same fusion of the lower and higher natures , and of the higher with the divine.

Marriage and the woman partner are used as symbols in two senses. In one the woman - or the womb, ark or cradle - is the abstract mind in its vehicle, the causal body. Marria ge refers to the descent of the fructifying monadic (the husband's) ray, as a result of which the higher mind becomes pregnant with the faculty of intuition and the power to perceive the oneness of life amidst diversity of form. Vv'hen these powers are developed to the degree at which they are consciously realized and employed, a s o n is said to be born. This is the initiatory interpretation and is employed in all accounts of divine and semi-divine nativities. In another meaning the woman is the outer personality, and more especially its formal mind. Marriage portrays the phase in its development at which the mentally fructifying influence of the inner Self (the husband), through the abstract inteUigence, is find­ ing a response in the hitherto wholly analytical, and therefore spiritually barren, formal mind. As a result of this type of union or marriage the faculty of abstract thought is added (conceived) to those of analysis a n d deduction, and when this is recognized and consciously used a son is said to have been born. Earlier peoples saw nothing obscene or impure in the procreative power, process and organs, and nothing indecent in their use as physical symbols of both divine creative power and cosmogenesis, and mystical unions and their fruits as attained by initiated men.

Dawn, or daybreak, represents the process of return to manif estation and illumination. This change and its effects are well illustrated in the incident of the denial of his Master by Peter in the night, and his repent-ance and remorse as soon as day broke.1 The story of this episode is one of those luminous cameos of condensed revelation of psycho-spiritual e x pe r i e n ce s on the path of discipleship. Oil is one of many symbols used to denote : a special charac­ teristic of spiritual wisdom; univers al, sanctified and sacrificial love; the universal life principle; and the bliss, the harmony a nd the deep understanding which flow forth from these states of consciousness. An example of the use of oil as a symbol occurs in the following passage from the Bible : \"Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Eli sha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou kno west tluJt thy servant did fear the LoRD: and the cred itor is come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen. \"And Elish a said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what hast thou in the htJuse?

This is also the esoteric meaning of all allegories which describe the multiplication of a small quantity into a large one. Here a fact in nature, and not a miracle, is revealed. This fact is that when once an indiv idual has become consciously at one with the universal life and becomes a channel for its harmonizing, healing and mentally nour:shing influence, the experience of unity is deepened and the capacit y to serve is increased. In addition, the recipients of this ministration receive a similar expansion and recognize and ratify the same law. In these ways nnt decrease, but increase, follows these expressions of divine love.

The Peacock represents that state of ignorance and foolish pride into which man can fall. The 011ter display of the peacock, e�peciaily of the form and colors of the male, does not appear to be matched by a corresponding intellectual power. Nevertheless the life-force finds expression even in so foolish a bird, which in reality is only following the ways of its own spe cies. These ways prove to be adequate; for, like the rest of nature, the peacock species is perpetuated and preserved on earth. Innate wisdom operates successfully despite intellectual limita­ tions. Indeed, in some cases pure, natural wisdom finds a fuller and freer expression in a less active mind-brain. Ma'l, hims elf, also passes through the \"peacock\" phase of his evolution. This was chiefly during the Fourth Root Race, in which the emotional nature and aura of man underwent their long development. Mind still slept save in the more advanced, and not until the later sub­ races, when the Fifth Root Race was already advanced, was mind added as a faculty and a power possessed and used by the fifth human race upon this earth. The peacock weii symbolizes the Fourth Root Race, in which the radiant colors of the astral aura and the faculties which they represent were the subject of natur e's handiwork. The aptness of the symbolism becomes plain when it is remembered that the male peacock displays his brilliant hues partly as a means of winning the favors of the female; for the brig htly colored astral aura of man is also the seat of procreative desire, and certain of its colors also shine more brillia ntly than normal when feelings of love, whether platonic or sexual, are aroused and find expr ession. While the unicorn has a dual significan ce, representing an early and a later root race (the third and the sixth ), the peacock symbolizes the relatively mind-free Fourth Root Race and also both the later Sixth and Seventh Root Races when, without the"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"120 THE HIDDEN WISDOM IN THE HOLY BIBLE intervention of the deductive intellect, the splendor of the intuitive faculty will be made manifest and man will Jive less in his mind than in his spiritual nature, and so possess both an intuitive wisdom and an implicit insight into every first truth . This racial attainment also is foreshadowed in the initiate, who attains to the powers of later races and must possess and be able to display the appropriate faculties. His aura shines, indeed, with the peacock's brill iant hues. His intuitive wisdom is as a hundred eyes, which makes him relatively omniscient, and though regarded by his fellow men outside the sanctuary as intellectually negligible, he is in reality the adornment of the race. The shining, silken feathers and the bejewelled neck and tail of the peacock aptly represent both the aura and the powers of future races of men on earth, as also of those individuals who outstrip their fellows and attain to a regal, spiritual splendor far in advance of their own race and age. The peacock is also regarded as a symbol of royalty. Pillars generally represent a vehicle for the creative force, both in nature and in man.

Despite this seasonal change, the r e p t i l e itself is unchanged and appears in a new and glistening cov e r i ng.

The serpent is represented in man in both its constructive and its destructive aspects. The Higher Self, the will-wisdom of the Spiritual Soul, corresponds to the serpent of light, while the desire nature contains destructive potentialities. The mind is the balancing force, or rod, between these two oppositely polarized energies, or serpent, in man. The serpent on the cross lifted up by \\1oses in the wilderness to heal the Israelites of their sickness,' is a symbol of wisdom united with the mind to purify and elevate the lower self, and heal it of its material tendencies and the effects of their expression. The serpent is used also to portray the harmonizing and heal­ ing influence of the Christ-nature in man, which has power to heal and raise the dead to life. This implies the power to transmute the lower aspects of human nature into tl:!e higher. Aesculapius, the god of healing, frequently appeared in the form of a serpent and the caduceus, the staff of Hermes, has been regarded as a symbol of healing force. Serpents were described as three- headed, as winged, as having human legs, being loud-breathing, hissing, poisonous, and as having yellow poison flowing over them. In the higher aspects this sym­ bolizes the action of the threefold Higher Self, especially the prin­ ciple of pure wisdom within it. The lower, destructive activities of the serpent of ancient symbology refer to the predatory and de­ structive desires and passio ns of man. The hero who destroys the latter personifies the initiate who has transmuted the lower into the higher, and has himself attained to perfect equilibrium between them. When the serpent's tail is in its mouth an endless circle is made, implying the eternity of wisdom, and even etarnity itself. Esotericatly, however, processes of cosmogenesis are indicated by the union of a symbolized positive and negative, or the eRtry of the tail into the mouth. All generative processes are, i.ndeed, indicated in this form of the symbol.

Here the laws of electricity, under which all generative processes occur, are in d icat ed . The driving force from within which leads to creative activity in organic forms, and chemical affini ty is inorganic, is indeed bi-polar. The aptness of the choice of the serpent as a symbol for this power would seem to be suppor ted by the fact that its tongue is forked. It is the positive and negative currents of the Great Breath, continually breathed forth as Fohat into and through every atom of every world, to become omnipresent and perpetually active throughout the whole universe. This fact was both concealed and reve aled in ancient allegories in which Jupiter, and other male creative deities, changed themselves into snakes for the purpose of seducing godd esses. In cosmogenesis such god desses personify matter, the waters of space, the feminine receptive and reproductive principle. Microcos mically the human Monad corresponds to God the Father, and the Spiritual Self in its vesture of light corresponds to the godde ss. When evolution has brought the Spiritual Self of man to readiness for the \"birth\" into dominant power of the Christ-nature in man, a descent occurs (the mystical Annuncia ­ tion) of the fohatic or fructifying power from the Monad into the hith erto \"virginal\", awaiting Spiritual Self. This is the Heavenly Marriage, the Imm aculate Conception, from which Christlike con­ scious ness and po w er are \"born\".

Before this reversal of the flow of creative energy can be achieved, positive and negative currents must be aroused and themselves, like twin serpents, flow upwards, inter­ twining as they §ow to induce an ascent of the accompanying neutral energy. Entering the brain, this triple power so iliumines the mind of man that he becomes, as it were, a god (possessed of theurgic powers ). This fact is revealed in Genesis1 where Adam and Eve represent the oppositely polar ized currents, the tree of knowledge of good and evil (particularly the trunk) corresponds to the rod, and the tempting serpent to the creative force ascending along the Sushumna canal. Thus Adam and Eve are forbidden to eat of the fruit of this tree, since by so doing they would become as gods. The intensely heightened vibrations of the brain, the glands, the cells and the aerial substanc e in the ventricles, cause the brain and cranium to be responsive to egoic and monadic life and con­ sciousness.

The shaft of Atmic f.ire which fonns the core of the force which plays along the Sushumna canal is brought down to the densest physical level, or symbolically \"cast upoR the ground\".

Moses is therefore made to flee bl!fore the serpent.

Rods which blossom, as did Aaron's, have a similar significance.1 The opening of the force-centers in the superphysical bodies, consequent upon the arousing and the up­ ward flow of the serpent power, is depicted by such symbols. As previously stated, the historic occult names for the positive and the negative currents of force are Pingala and Ida, and the triple up­ ward flow is most perfectly revealed by the Greek symbol of the caduceus. Hermes is the Moses of the Greeks, in that he is a messenger from God to man by virtue of holding in his hand the caduceus, just as Moses held in his hand the rod. Hermes also delivered Persephone from the unden vorld, Hades, even as Moses delivered Israel from bondage in Egypt. The dark and light colored serpents of the caduceus sym­ bolize the dual power of the secret wisdom - black and white magic.

Jesus advised his disciples, Sayin g \" ... be ye therefore wise as serpe nts, and harmless as doves.\"2 This may be taken as a veiled reference either to the serpent fire or to the wisdom and the prudence of the Adept or \"serpent\". The two serpents symbolize all apparently oppos ing and hostile pairs in the world's alleg ories. They embody the idea of dualism and the supposed struggle between good and evil, spirit and matter, light and darkness, gods and demons, Saviors and serpent s and dragons, Cain and Abel, Esau and Jacob, and Osiris, Apollo and Python.

The result is the retention of the full powers of both of the opponents, the light and the dark st�rpents, and the attainment of the capacity to use either or both of them while the user remains in a cond ition of dynamic aquilibrium. This attainment is symbolized by the crushing of the head of the serpent by Sri Krishna, and the victories over reptiles by the Saviors and heroes of other ancient peoples. Contemplation of the symbol of the caduceus will reveal how perfectly it portrays that process and that attainment. This saving power, the Christos, entered into the man Jesus, the human vehicle, at the moment of his baptism in Jordan, and from then on Jesus began to work miracles by divine autho rity. The holding of the caduceus (or rod or serpent) in the hand is itself a symbol imply­ ing mastery of a power, and the possession of knowledge and skill in its employment. The transmutation of rod into serpent, be it noted, could only occur at the command of the Deity and by his magical power. Actually, the descent of the Monadic Atma through all the vehicles and down the spinal cord into the sacrum is essential to the prema­ ture full-awakening of the triple creati ve fire and its successf ul sublimation and use as a magical tool. To bring this power of Atma down is one part of the office of the hierophant of the greater mysterit�s. Si-nce there after a new life is begu·n, the act has ever been com:ctly termed initia tion.

The outer walls, for example, represent both the physical body and human consciousness when limited to physical awareness. The courtyard with its various sub­ sidiary buildings represents the psych e or personal soul. The people passing into and from the temple personify the day by day emotions and thoughts by which the inner man is partly expressed through the lower quaternary (the four sides of the complete edifice ). The building of the temple itself, as distinct from its outer walls, and including particularly its foundation, walls, roof, embellishments, domes, minarets and spires, represents the inner individuality, the Inner Ruler Immortal, the Spiritual Soul with its developed quali­ ties within its vesture of light, the causal body, itself symbolized by the material structure. The interior of the temple represents the intellect of man, and more particularly that aspect of the mind which responds to abstract and spiritual ideals and ideas. The people who are present personify mental activities, the traffic of the mind, and more especially the aspirations, the illuminations and the intuitions received when the mind is in an elevated mood, or in the temple state of consciousness. The sanctuary, or the Holy of Holies, is a symbol of the vehicle of spiritual intuition, the \"shrine\" of the God within, the dweller in the innermost. The tabernacle and the sacred objects within all represent the seventh principle of man, the ray and the radiance of the Monad with its spiritually creative powers, the true divine Presence above and within the sanctuary of the Soul. The veil of the temple repres ents the protective region, at whatever level, between the innermost and the outermost. The true glory must itself ever be veiled, both as protection against profana­ tion from below and as a safeguard against premature discovery and misuse of the truth of truths and the power of powers. The truth of truth s is that God and man are one. The power of powers is that of spiritual creativeness. Both are dangerous to man until he is wholly sanctified, and therefore incapable of mis­ using them.

Ordination, consecration, sanctification, which permit a priest to enter the sanctuary, ideally imply both complete transcendence of the sense of separateness from God and all his other manif esta­ tions and also the final renunciation, because outgrown, of personal possessiveness and pride. When this has been achieved, the veil of the temple is rent. The account of the twelve-year-old Jesus in the temple4 (like every other allegory, an interior experience of one individual) portrays the threefo ld (by addition, 12 equals 3) Spiritual Soul thus illumined, and therefore able to display superior wisdom and bestow illumination upon the mind, represented by the doctors with their memorized knowledge and traditional beliefs and formal methods of thought. Mary and Joseph were away from the temple. In consequence, they missed and feared they had lost their son.5 They represent the higher aspects of the personal consciousness, the mind- brain which had for a time been allowed to become too greatly absorbed with material considerations. Their return to the temple in search of the temporarily lost light indicates successful meditation by which the personal consciousness had been elevated into self­ realization, self-d iscovery of the immortal, spiritual being within the Au goe ides or \"temple\" of light. The discovery of their son6 portrays the success of the quest and the resultant illumination which is received by the mind-brain from the higher, abstract mind, the intuition and the spiritual will.

Most people tend to apply worldly standards of judgment of spiritual laws, truths and activities. The explanation of Jesus : \" ... wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?\", 1 corrects this error and directs the mind upward to the innermost Self, the Father, and to the imper­ sonal principles and purposes by which the Higher Self is animated. A mystical experience is also described and guidance in its attain­ ment is given. The mind-brain, it is shown, discovers that illumina­ tion demands a universaJ.ization of consciousness and outlook. In other words, the temple state of consciousness must be entered. Spiritual rather than worldly values must be accepted. The mind must become flexible in order to receive wisdom, as did ilie doctors in the temple, however much it may at first appear to contrav ene traditional ideas and modes of thought. Then the realization will be attained of the ever youthful, ever new, Divine Presence within the temple - the power, the wisdom and the knowledge of the Christ-na ture - symbolized by the twelve-year-old Jesus. In the initiatory interpretation the truth is revealed that the new-born, the initiate, can no longer be bound by personal ties of family, nation or race. He is a citizen of the world and a servant of the whole of humanity. The mothers of Moses and Jesus learnt and acquiesced in this law, though doubtless not without some pangs experienced by the maternal heart. In their microcosmic interpretation, all the recorded visits of Christ to the temple to­ gether constitute an allegorical description of the way of illumination. The outer temple and courtyards must be cleansed. The money-changers must be cast out,2 meaning that the daily life must be free from acquisitiv eness and especially from the profanation of spiritual things. Ultimately all sense of separated individuality will have been outgrown - the temple will have been demol ished - and the Spiritual Self within liberated or \"saved\", as is indicated by Christ's affirmation of his ability at will to destroy and rebuild the temple,3 and by his prophecy of its destruction.4 As this state is I U. 2:49. 2 Mall. 21 : 12. 3 Mall. 26:61. 4 Mall. 24:2."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"134 THE HIDDEN WISDOM IN THE HOLY BIBLE approached, the outer man becomes almost mir aculously perfect.

Success is assured for all who similarly search; for the young Christ ever sits in the temple which is the Spiritua l Soul of man. Wisdom is always available to those who will enter the temple self-cleansed, self-healed, and seeking light as ardently as loving parents seek their only son who is temporarily lost. Trees connote the omnipresent, divine, creative life within all nature and in man, the very tree of life itself. Microcosmic ally, trees refer to that same creative life individu alized as the pro­ creative force. To climb a tree to see the Christ, as did Zacchaeus,2 and to be hung on a tree, indicate the full sublimation of that force and the consciousness of the divine which this makes possible. The fruits of trees symbolize the products of the action of the life-force in nature and in man. The apple, especially, would seem to typify self-conscious, individua lized experience of the creative process, as in the case of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil partaken of by Adam and Eve, the eating of which brought about the so-called (and miscal led) \"Fall\". When the apples are golden the attainment of Buddhic consciousness is definitely symbolized, for such attainment is the fruit in man of the activity of the intuition. The Trumpet and the trumpet sound are also used as symbols m the Bible, and their significance is sufficiently great to justify an interpretation at length. The voice of the trumpet in the universe is the power of the \"Word\", the fully emitted, focused and directed creative force. The trumpet sound, however, indicates the same power made manif est, or sounding forth, through all the vehicles of man, from the Monadic to the physical. The trumpet is a tube down which the breath, another symbol for the self-same power, is forced and by which it is limited to the space within. As a result of this empowered, concentrated and contained expiration, the whole trumpet vibrates and therefore emits the note or sound of the com- I Matt. 21 : 14. 2 Uc. 19:4."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE OF SYMBOLS 135 press ed air or breath, which is a symbol of creative energy or the cosmogenetic \"Word\".

Whenever it may, truthfully b u t s y mb o l ica l l y , be said that on the mount the sound of the trumpet waxes louder and louder,1 and that before Jericho the people hear the sound of the trumpet,2 then man has brought all his seven. principles and his whole nature into attunement with the Monad, and through that with the Logos, with which the Monad is for ever at o n e . At that consummation the divine \"voice\" is keard an.d r eso u n d e d in seven forms or modes of sound, one for each vehicle of consciousness, throughout the higher and the lower selves of man.

The personal chord, hitherto often discordant, is s u b m erg ed aad e x ting u i s hed as a separate tone within the great trumpet sound produced by the divine Breath. When this condition is att a i n e d, communion between the Higher Self and the Monad occurs. Moses speaks to God and God answers by a \"voice\". Yet voice it is not, nor any sound.

The light shines forth from the creative center to illumine the darkness and render visible the hither to invisible robes in which the cosmic Mother is enwrapped. The will becomes more potent, the sound louder and the light brighter as the aeons pass. The Monads become more radiant and their monadic rays flash forth as wider and more brilliant beams.

In man, as one such dweller and toiler in the worlds, the inertia and silence inherent in matter give place to rhythmic motion (the walls of Jericho fall down) and the heard and answered cosmic \"voice\". In man, as in universe, darkness is displaced by light. It is this stage in the creative and evolutionary process which is allegorically described by the sound of the trumpet waxing loud and strong, and by the verbal intercourse between Moses and God upon Mount Sinai. The summit is not yet attained. Unity is not yet achieved; for when there is unity there is no need for, or even possibility of, external interchange. The realization of unity is described generally by the death or magical ascension (Enoch,1 Elijah,2 Christ,3) of the body, as the Soul is caught up and absorbed into its God.

The uni­ corn or horned horse, for example, in one of its many possible meanings, is a symbol for the sublimated creative force in man. The horn, emerging from. the brain, indicates that the expression of the cre ative power and desire occurs through the will -inspired intellect and its craRial organ, which is chiefly the pituitary gland. The horn is occultly phallic and the horse is an oft-used symbol for the lower quaternary. It is also the Pegasus which the hero Beller­ ophon, the initiate Ego, catches and masters with a golden bridle. This bridle is a symbol for the developed will-tho ught by means of which the personal nature of man (Pegasus ) is controlled and guided. The winged horse was caught near a fountain, typifying the source of life. Mounting it, Bellerophon rose into the air and slew the Chimaera, a fire-breathing monster (the passion). Thereafter the initiate Ego is no longer limited to the surface of the earth and the physical body; he soars, as if winged, into the empyrean, the higher states of consciousness.

Egypt is a topographical symbol for the sanctuary of the greater mysteries and the Hall of Initiation wherein Jesus, like e very initiate, was sanctified and consecrated to his mighty task. Jerusalem is the immortal Self of man, the spiritual Triad, in which the initiate is fully conscious. This \"Jerusalem\" state of conscious­ ness is achieved while wide awake in the often resistant quaternary. Symbolically, the Christ triumphant rides into Jerusalem upon an ass.

Ulysses personifies the evolutionary procedure, and the stake which he thrust into the eye of the giant in the cave (the head of man) is the downward thrust of spirit-life bringing the Monad­ Egos of men through the temporary blindness of the physical, emo­ tional and early lower mental phases of human development. The Adepts and initiates of old thus enshrined in allegory and symbol their ethnological, historical and occult knowledge, leaving it apparent for all that had eyes to see and yet veiled, because temporarily not needed and not without danger, until the time of unveiling should arrive. The present is the time, and in this age the modern Adepts are re-awakening the slumbering memories and long sleeping powers of their younger brothers, the humanity whom the Adept Brotherhood has never ceased to care for and to guide. Tire J' eil is used in both the Old and the New Testaments. In terms of consciousness, the veil symbolizes the mental barrier which restricts awareness and thought during physical incarnation to the limitations of the formal, concrete brain-mind. On account of this \"veil\", transference of intellectual light, creative genius, inspi­ rntion from the Higher Self to the lower, is normally both diffi cult nnd rare. When it is achieved, distortion and severe \"privation\" of the transmuted abstract ideas are likely to occur. Barrenness sym­ bolizes this restricted conditi on of mind. The heavenly marriage nn<.l conception, as the ultimate full union of the higher and lower aclves is symbolically called, has not yet been achieved. Here an example is quoted of the use of the symbols of the barrenness and later conception of a woman in adva nced age, which may usefu lly acrve to illustrate the principle of the veil: \"Then the woman came"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"142 THE HIDDDI WISDOM IN THE HOLY BIBLE and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me, and his countenance was like the count enance of an angel of God, very terrib le : but I asked him not whence he was, neiti:J.er told he me his name.\"1 Herein is allegor ically described both a prerequisite for succ essful passage through ti:J.e first of the great initiations (seeing a man of God, the Augoeidcs ), and the psycho-s piritual condition (conception) to which the fully prepared candidate has attained.

The former is represented by the man of God and the latter by the wife and mother-to-be. Up to the time of preparedness for the first initiation in the indivi dual, and of the general unfoldment of tbe intuitive faculty in the race, a barrier or veil exists between these two aspects of human nature, the Egoic and the personal. This barrier and cause of intellectual and spiritua l barrenness is like the veil before the sanctuary in that temple which is man himself, in whom abides the spirit of the Highest, the innermost diviae power and presence, called the Monad. In the Fiftb Root Race of the Fourth Round on this planet, this veil of the human temple is penetrated only by men who are in advance of the race, or subjected to special egoic and mental stimulation by either seniors in evolution or members of the angelic hosts, or as a result of unusual astrological aspects to which they are able to respo nd. As the sixth sub-race of the Fifth Root Race appears and develops, the veil between higher and lower minds becomes thinner, and in consequence the intui­ tive faculty shows itself. In the Adept of this period, and in humanity as a whole at the end of the Fourth Chain, the veil is \"rent\" or dissolved, as is made plain in accounts of the Crucifixion of Christ.2 The rending in twain of the veil of the temple is an allegory descriptive of a state of consciousness rather than of a supernormal phenomenon in a p hysical temple. 1 JUdRts 13:6. 2 Mall. 27:51."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"THE LA!\\GUAGE OF SYMBOLS 143 The statement that the woman of Zorah came and told her husband, Manoah, of the experience of annunciati on, reveals the intimate inter-communication already established between the two nspects of m in d in the individual who is fully prepared to be received into the greater mysteries, to be initiated, and to experi­ ence the \"birth\" of the int u it i ve faculty or Buddhic consciousness. The story of Pilate is of interest from this point of view. His wife had a drcam1 in the daytime, during waking consciousness ­ meaning egoic illumination. She did not herself go to Pilate, as did the woman of Zorah to her husband. She sent a messe nger, implying the absence of personal commun ication between them, the existence of a barrier of space or distance (a veil). Pilate did not heed the warnin g, however. He was not yet open to the light of intuition. As the lower mind not yet fully illumined, but approach­ ing that state, he committed Jesus ( i nt u iti on itself and the Christ­ nature within man ) to be crucified by the rabble.

Never­ theless initiates have spoken, but it is no secular tongue they use, comprehensible to the profan e; for to do so would be to break their solemn vow and to cast pearls before swine.2 When the illumi ned ones did speak they used a language especially invented for the purpose.

The subject of initiation is considered in Chapter I of Part Six. If it be questioned whether so complex an interpretation of the parable as is here offered is justified, and whether it was Our Lord's intention to refer to macrocosmic and microcosmic procedures in nature, it could be answered that the processes of involution and evolution are cyclic, and that this fact is implicit in all references to forthgoing and return, whether direct or in parable. In anything like a full exposition of the subject, extensions of the story to apply universally are, therefore, not only permissible but called for. Moreover, only a very restricted range of possible applications of the principle of cyclic progression is included, the subject actually embracing the whole of objective existence. It is on these bases tha t the following interpretations are offered. A comparison may usefully be made between the Gospel version of the great parable and the Gnostic Hymn of the Robe of Glory,2 which is an exposition of the same theme. In this story Our Lord gives o n e of the master keys to the understanding of both universe and man. All allegories written in the sacred language are susceptible of application in a number of ways. They may apply to the cosmos as a whole, to each solar system, to the human race, to the Monad of man and its seven principles or bodies, to the Ego of man and his repeated incarnations in the flesh, and to every human being who embarks upon the mode of life which will hasten his evolution, called by Isaiah \"The way of holiness\".3 This last includes admission to one or other of the schools of prophets, 4 and passage through their grades of initiation to emerge as a prophet, or one who both speaks from divine inspiration (Heb. Nalie) and is a seer ( H e b . ro ' eh). Interpretations of allegories and symbols from this last point of view are termed \"initiatory\" throughout this book. The term \"cosmos\" refers to the totality of the sidereal scheme, including all galaxies, all nebulae, all stars, all planets, all beings, 1 Marr. 7:13-14. 2 The H�mn of rhe Rob• of Glory, by G. R.

This totality is called throughout this work the \"macroc osm\" or \"Great World\". Since man is an epitome of the whole and all creation is represented within him as seed powers and vibratory potentialities (\"the por­ tion of goods that falleth to mc\"1), he is sometimes referred to as the \"microcosm\" or \"little world\". These two, the great and t:he lillie worlds, are one in essence. All that is true of the large r, the universal existence, is equally true of the lesser, human existence us individual man. Lao-tze truly said, \"The universe is a man on n large scale.\" Perhaps the most profound of all the prof ound truths con­ tained within the wisdom religion are those of the unity of the macrocosm with the microcosm, and of the close similarity between the processes by which both become man ifest and evolve.

Occult philosophy shares with modern science the view that the universe consists not of matter, as man's five senses would seem to indicate, but of energy, and adds that the universe of force is the kingdom of the gods; for fundamentally these beings are directors of universal forces, power agents of the Logos, his engi­ neers in the great creative process, which is regar ded as continuous. Creative energy is perp etually outpoure d; on its way from its source to material manif estation as apparent (to man ) physical substance and form, it passes through the bodies and auras of the gods. In the process the creative energy is \"transformed\", stepped down\" from its primordial potency.

The Elder Son Macrocosmically, the elder son personates the Elohim, or creative intelligences, archangels and angels, who never lose con­ sciousness of oneness with their divine Source. In this sense they remain at home. They are older than those Monads who embark upon the evolutionary journey which takes them through the physi­ cal plane, because they emanated first in the sequence of creative nctivities. These are the Seven Mighty Spirits before the Throne, the perfected Monads who reached their highest degree of develop­ ment in the preceding cycle or incarnation of the Logos in cosmos or solar system. As previously stated, these great beings and their hierar chies of angels remain at home in the sense that they are perpetually self-ide ntified with the Source of their being and life. A Biblical reference to them reads: \"When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy.\"' It may here be stated in advance that the suggestion in the parable of jealousy concerning the younger son is not to to taken meriously. It is possibly a cover or blind for the profound ideas revealed in the allegory, or even a deliberate direction of the mind awny from such beings and the power bestowe d upon those who are able to be in contact with and to invoke them for thaumaturgic purposes. A measure of reserve concerning too direct a reference to these beings is necessary, because they are agents for great cosmic forces. Human beings who communicate with the angelic hosts can learn to tap these forces and collaborate with their angel directors. Like Ezekiel, the young Zechariah, son of Berechiah, \"the prophet of the long vision\", evidently saw four at least of these nrchangelic creative intelligences, sometimes associ ated with the four quarters of the compass . He refers to them as four chariots drawn by red, black, white, grizzled and bay horses, but his angel teacher told him: \" ...

Wturing The Subsrance The term \"prodigal\" is applied to the younger son because he is said to have wasted his substance in riotous living after he hud arrived in the far country. This also is a veiled reference to the eternal oblation, as a result of which the Logos sacrificially pours out his life that his univer se may Jive. This voluntary self-cruci­ llxion of the cosmic Christos, the macrocosmic prodigal son, upon the cross of matter shaped into univer ses with their four directions of space, is referred to in Chapter I of Part Five of this work. Under certain conditions of heightened awareness the universal, Indwelling, divine life in nature becomes visible as an all-perv ading, wowing, golden life-force, omnipresent as an ensouling principle in every atom of every world. Physical forms then disappear. One is within and part of an all-pervading ocean of golden, glowing life, which appears to consist of myriads of points of light inter­ connected by lines of force, the whole being part of an appar ently Infinite, living web1 of exceedingly fine mesh which pervades all beings, all things, all wor lds. Each of the points is found to be a aource of life, almost a sun, within which life-force wells up as rrom an inexhaustible fount. From these centers the golden power lluws along the great web, vitalizing all substance. There is no dead matter. All beings and all things are seen to be filled with the Indwelling life or fire of God. An inspired poet truly desc ribed this atute of consciousness :- \"Lo!

Thus, at the Crucifixion it is said of the crucified Christ: \"And they crucified him, and parted his garm ents, casting lots.\"1 This causing of the one to become many in order that the manifestation of the hitherto unmanifest may occur, is described in other world Scriptures as the death and dismemberme nt of Saviors and Deities, such as Osiris and Bacchus. On the pathway of return (the prodigal son returning home ) these temporarily separated parts are restored to unity, or fully recognized by perfected men as illusory ; for form alone is discrete and diverse, while the life within forever remains an integral whole. This is partly indicated by the placing of a new robe - a whole or \"seamless\" garment - upon the prodigal son, and the reuniting of the several parts of the dismembered bodies of Saviors and Deities. The Father's Home The conscio usness of a Logos of a universe (its father) is established in the highest spir itual world, called in Sanskrit Adi meaning \"the first\" . At this level one might possibly assume that the presiding Deity is transcen dent above and beyond the universe. Allegorically, the father remains at home with the cos mic creative intelligences who, in their synthe sis, are the \"first-born\", \"the first frui ts\", the elder son. This highest of all worlds, the plane of the most tenuous of all degrees of dens ity of substance, is the celestial abode of the \"Father which is in heaven\". This is the \"holy habita­ tion'? \"heaven thy dwelling place\" .3 Here in Adi abides in indi visible unity the primeval Creative Force, eternal and uncreated, but manif esting periodically. This is the abstract aspect of the Supreme -infinite, absolute, attri buteless. It is an impersonal, nameless, universal principle, the God Tran­ scendent which periodically becomes the God Immanent (the prodigal son ). The Monads as microcosms have their abiding-place in the Monadic world, called in Sanskrit Anupadaka, meaning \"the 1 Mall. 27:35. 2 Deur. 26: IS. 8 1K inj's 8:30"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"THE PATHWAY OF FORTHGOING 163 parentless\" . This level of manifestation is but one degree denser in the consistency of its substance than the first, or Adi. In the case of the inunortal Ego of man, as also of its vehicle -the Aug oeides, the Gnostic \"Robe of Glory\", the causal body ­ the father's home is the realm of the Higher Mind, the abstract intellect of man. The Prodigal Son Take& Hi& Portion and Journey& Into a Far Counlry Macrocosmically, the \"portion\" represents both the volume (if such a term may be used) of cosmic life apportioned to a single unit of manifestatio n, such as a solar system, and the inherent potentialities of the Monads which are to issue forth from the parental Source , the Logos (the father ). Before manifestation the potenti alities of the Monads were not apparent, though present as their spiritual essence. This is the condition obtaining in the father's home before the prodigal son \"journeys into a far country\". When manifestation begins, the Monads project their rays into the evolutionary field. In due course these projected rays become individualized into immortal human Souls, using vehicles more especially expressive of the faculty of abstract thought Plato in the Timaeus says: \"Now when the Creator had framed the soul according to his will [the Monads as miniature replicas of himself] he formed within her the corporeal universe . . . . \" These are the divine seeds of the parent Tree of Life, within which infinite cosmic potencies reside. Neither the miscalled \"Fall\" of man nor the forthgoing of the prodigal son are in the least degree errors or sins, such attribution being entirely fallacio us. The process of \"planting\" alone is indi­ cated; for just as the gardener must place his seeds in the darkness below the surface of the soil, where they are out of his sight and left to the myster ious operations of the creative life-force within them, so the Divine Gardener (the father in the parable ) must \"plant\" or send out into the universal field or garden his Monads, seeds of his very existence.

This term is, perhaps, more especially app l i cab l e to the seventh and densest of t h e se gradations or planes, namely the physical world. In our Planetary Sche m e, 2 in which the earth is the densest globe, the deepest point of descent reached by spirit and life on the path of forthgoing is, in f act , the miner al kingdom of p h y s i cal nature.

Microcosmically, the \"far country\" has at least three signifi­ cations. In one of them, in which the Monad is the prodigal son, the whole solar system is away from \"home\" and the physical level is farthest away, or \"a far countr y\". The Monadic radiation, in its tum, reaches the deepest point of descent as a result of in­ carnation in a mortal personality, and especially in its dense physi­ cal body. If the spiritual Soul or Ego of man be regarded as the prodigal son, then the mental, the emotional, the etheric and the physical planes and levels of consciousness are the evolutionary field. Again, the physica l body, being the densest, is \"a far country\". There the immortal Ego is most deeply imprisoned. There it is least conscious of its heavenly nature or is, symbolically, farthest away from the father's home. As has already been mentioned, and as will be more fully ex­ plained as the books of the Bible are successively interpreted in later volumes, the monadic seeds of life, the jour ney of life, and the greatest distance which is reached on that journey, are all portray ed in the Bible by means of various allegories and symbols. Egypt and Babylon, where the Israelites (the nation typifying the prodigal son) were made captive, the pit into which Joseph was lowered, Samson's prison, and the rock tomb of Christ, are all emblematical of the densest phases entered upon, as also of the turning points at which the direction of the pilgrimage is reversed and the prodigal son arises and makes his way home. In a third possible microc osmic interpretation, the \"far country\" is represented as the physic al body of a baby at birth and through early infancy. While birth in a physical body does mark Ihe limit of the distance to which the egoic ray of life and con­ sciousness descends, and is also a turning point, during the early months little or no self-manifestation of the Ego in its new vehicle is possible. In this sense, for the reincarnating imm ortal Self the baby form represents \"a far country\"."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"166 THE HIDDEN WISDOM IN THE HOLY BIBLE \"A. Mighty Famine\" Macrocosmically, famine repre sents the inertia temporarily resulting from the equilibrium of spirit and matter. When the deepest density is reached, neither of them is able greatly to influ­ ence the other. \"God sleeps in the mineral\", it is said, meaning that the extreme density of the encasing mineral form prevents external awareness and activity by the entombed, \"sleeping\", en­ souling spirit-life. Microcosmically, the famine refers to the absence of spiritual understanding from the brain-mind. During the physical, the emotional and the early mental racial epochs, the bodily man is not consciously sustained by any spiritual impulses or soul nourish­ ment, as it were. In later evolutionary phases this condition can also be temporarily expe rienced as, for example, during times of self-indulgence and delib erately chosen selfish and sensual ways of life. Both of these conditions are portrayed in the sacred language by famines. Hunger and thirst arc also sometimes used as symbols of the absence of, and the longing for, truth. After the unsatisfactory character of mere externals as food for mind and heart has been realized, manna as the \"bread of heaven\", or truth directly per­ ceived, becomes an urgent necessity; it is hungered and thirsted for, and is urgently sought. In this sense famine represents deprivation, and even ignorance, of that true wisdom for which the awakened soul is longing, or for which it is ahunger and athirst. As is so often the practice in the sacred language, when a physical symbol is translated into its mystical import the meaning becomes reversed. Famine, for example, is a physical disaster, but the hungry and thirsty condition of the Soul can prove to be a pre­ lude to the search for truth. Thus the Lord Christ said: \"Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteo usness: for they shall be filled.\"1 Similarly, the statement \"he began to be in want\", 2 though descriptive of a painful experience, is in reality a most favorable sign; for such \"want\" is the precursor of the search for food, meaning nutriment for the mind and spirit. 1 Matt. �:6. 2 L.k. 15: 14."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"THE PATHWAY OF FORTHGOING He llires llimself as a Swineherd 167 Swine are used as symbols of the lowest and most sensual instincts and desires of man.

A Farmer Hires Him and Sends Him Into the Fields The macrocosmic journey of forthgoing is described by the words: \"he sent him into his fields to feed swine \".1 The farmer, or \"citizen of that country\", represents the creative Logos who prepares or \"tills\" the fields of space in readine ss for the sowing of the seeds, or the descent of the Monad-bearing life-wave - the prodigal son. The reference to feeding the swine here indicates the near approach of this life-wave to the lowest point of descent, swine being regarded, if perhaps unfairly, as somewhat unclean and lowly beasts. To tend them, theref ore, would be one of the most menial forms of service. Microcosmically, the monadic ray penetrates deeper and deeper into the evolutionary field and the Ego draws near to the time of birth. The egoic ray, in its pre-n atal descent, has pene­ trated the etheric world and become attached to the embryo.� He Feeds the Swine in the Fields Macroc osmically. the one life (the prodigal son) vitalizes gross material forms (the swine). Without this inner sustenance they would die of inanition (famine ). Similarly, the Monad as micro­ cosm empowers and spiritually \"feeds\" the Ego, which in its turn inspires and vitalizes the personality. Both of these manif estations of the Monad would be lifeless or \"famished\" without their indwelling, divine life. Also, for the first seven years of each new incarnation the Ego cannot use the new body very much; it thus experiences a metaphorical famine, which it does its best to mitigate by putting forth as much of its power, life and conscious­ ness as the growing vehicles can receive, assimilate and express.

He Hungera Macrocosmically, the upward turn is now foreshadowed. The attraction of spirit is beginning gradually to overcome the grip of matter and draw the outpoured, manifested life back toward its Source. This is sometimes symbolized as hunger and thirst. which are made to represent the longing for the bread of esoteric truth and the waters of sacred knowledg e, the inexpressible longing of the inner man for the infinite. Thus the Psalmist sang: \"My soul thirsteth for G o d , for the living God\".1 Thirst is also oppositely used as a symbol for a longing for the illusion of self-separated existence and for the gratification of the lusts of pride and sense - the cause of human suffering, as the Lord Buddha taught. These chain the immortal Ego to the wheel of birth and death; for it is this thirst for life, this clinging to life on this earth, which causes rebirth or reincarnation. When, at last, it is replaced by the thirst for freedom from the round of birth and death, for liberation or salvation in order to be more effective in the service of God and man, then such thirst becomes the very force which strikes away the fetters from the soul. The microcosmic meaning of the condition of hunger thus emerges. It implies that the Ego, as prodigal son, has become suffi­ ciently evolved to aspire to the Monad, and the personal man in his turn to reach up to the Ego. The great quest - as for the mystical Holy Grail - is about to be embarked upon. The impulse is beginning to stir within the man thus moved, as a result of which, as mystic, he will make the irrevocable resolve expressed in the words of the prodigal son: \"I w i ll arise\".2 He Foin Would Eat of the Huaka Thar tire Swine Did Eat Macroco smically, the husks are outer physical cove ri ngs, or temporary forms, which have been cast off by the involving and evolving life.

The in\\olut ionary and evolutionary thrusts are so nearly balanced, that throughout the epoch of equilibrium no particular impulse backward or for­ ward is strongly felt (one form of the \"famine ''). In consequence habit rules instinctual impu lse, if not delibera te action. In another sense the yearning indica tes that the one life has reached the outermost husk or crust of the universe, the mineral kingdom of a physical planet. Husk-eating, then, implies existence and the receipt of experience within that densest, outermost form. In the microcosmic, Monadic sense the corn of wheat represents the immortal germ - the Monad - which, borne out into the field of evolution by the outpoured spirit -life, must descend into the deepest depths of matter and there lie latent (die) before that germ can produce a reproduction of its parents. In terms of the human intellect, this phase of the journey of the prodigal son corresponds to the evolutionary stage at which the human mind is unable to comprehend (famine) abstract and spiritual ideas, truths and laws. In consequence concrete, rigid forms (husks ), both in thought and in action, are sought and chosen faute de mieux. In religion, for example, formalism and the dead-letter, literal reading (hu sks) of the scriptures would be hungered for and insisted upon. Allegory, symbol and the purely historical view (husks ) would be preferred to mystical interpreta­ tions and the eternal truths (Lhe grain within) which those inter­ pretations reveal.

In this more mystical significa nce the famine is an essential precursor of the culmi nating spiritual feast , or agape. Until this awakening occurs, forms and formalism in every aspect of life are sought. Symbolically the prodigal son, as the Ego in the mind-brain, fain would eat of these husks, knowing nothing else. Eventually, however, realization of the husk-like or totally unsatisfying nature of outer forms produces a yearning for the permanent realities within.

This meta­ physical use of the terms \"hunger\" and \"thirst\" frequently occurs in the Bible, as in the texts : \"For he (the Lord) satisficth the long­ ing soul, and fillcth the hungry soul with goodness\",1 and \"Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteo usness: for they shall be filled.\" 2 To sum up, famine, hunger, thirst and yearning for the husks have two main significations. One is descriptive of the mental and spiritual phases of human evolution at which the mere gross covering or \"husk\" of life, thought and religion - the lesser mysteries - is chosen and its value insisted upon. The other refers to a later phase when these things arc at last perceived for what they really are, mere husks, and the golden grain - the greater mysteries - alone is hungered for and sought. In one other sense tanha (Pali), thirst for life in form, is indicated by yearning for the husks. The eternal, formless, uni­ versal life is as yet unknown, and even inconceivable. The tem­ porarily concrete, the particular with its outer form, is clung to as the means of satisfying desire and the only rock of salvation. Form inevitably fails the seeker for reality, who must outgrow the desire for it, recognize its temporary nature , and be ready to renounce it in order that the eternal, universal life within may be known. Our Lord, as so often, chose an analogy from nature to express this truth, saying: \" •..

The famine condition still obtains, in the sense that the return can only be consummated after the phase of Monadic individual ization as human Egos has been entered upon and passed through . The animal kingdom is, as it were, the portal to this stage and, whether intended or not, the prodigal son's association with animals (swine) does seem to indicate that this phase imme diately preceding individualization had been entered upon. In the microcosm, man's discovery of reality is acc ompanied by recognition of the facts that the Soul's hunger can never be satisfied by \"food\" from without, and that the journey home can­ not be completed as long as there is dependence upon any external support. Only by virtue of the indwelling life within, and by rel iance upon that alone, can human lim itations be left behind and superhumanity (the new robe), or fully conscious union with God (the return of the prodigal son ), be attained. The loneliness of the mystic is also indicated. When spiritual awakening occurs and the pursuit of the eternal is decided upon, family, friends and erstwhile intimate associates sometimes fail, not unnaturally, to understand the change of motive for living, and the mode of life which must be follow ed, when at last a man says: \"I will arise\".

In the sacred language the symbol of bodily death is used to indicate the attainment by the Soul of freedom from the limitations of the personality, and especially those of the mind. Christ is thus crucified and dies, a very clear suggestion of the true meaning being given by causing the C ru c i fi x i o n to occur on G o lg o t h a , the place of a skull, the seat of the mind-brain. In this more mystical sense, the prodigal son's confession of having sinned against heaven and before God is descriptive not only of sensual indulg ence, but also of realization of the limitations of the argumentative mind and of disputation as means of discover­ ing truth. When this realization is achieved, those methods are relegated to a subordinate, but still important, place. In the sense that his search for truth and light is hencef orth directed to those spiritual levels of consciousness wherein alone they are to be found, the prodigal son thus makes his way back to his father's home. 1 Gen. 37:28. 2Ex. 13:17. 3 JudR<S 16:25. 4 Dan. 6:23.

A description of some of these sub-cycles would seem to be appro­ priate at this point, both as additions to this interpretation of the parable and in explanation of terms used throughout this work. According to the philosophy upon which this book is based Kolar systems, in obedience to univer sal cyclic law, perpetually emerge, pass into obscuration and re-emerge. Each new \"creation\" contin ues the involution ary and evolutionary processes from the stage reached at the close of the preceding era. These periods of obscuration and man ifestation are known respectively as \"nights\" und \"days\". The matter of our solar system is arranged in seven degrees of density, generally called planes of nature. The subtlest, most refined or most spiritu alized condition of matter forms the first plane; and the densest, least refined, least spirituali zed condition forms the lowest or seventh plane of nature. These must not be thought of as strata or planes in the usual sense of the term, for tht'Y interpenetrate; and as the scale of refinement is ascended, extend further away from the physical globe. Each of these seven planes is in its tum composed of matter of seven degrees of density, called sub-planes.

This is the sevenfol d evolutionary field through which the Monads (prodigal sons) pass on their involu­ tionary and evolutionary journeys, as a result of which their latent powers germinate and develop. At the opening of the major cycle of manifestation the Monad-bearing life-wave (the cosmic \"prod­ igal son\") emerges from the divine consciousness, which is estab­ lished at the highest of these levels, and descends through the seven planes to the lowest, as heretofore explained. Thereafter the return journey is begun, culminating in reabsorption into the Source. The solar system to which our humanity belongs consists of ten planetary schemes, each composed of seven chains of globes, some superphysical and some physical. Each chain is composed of seven rounds, during each of which the life-stream (the prodigal son), bearing with it the evolving beings, journeys once round the seven globes. The period of occupation of one of the seven globes, on which seven root races develop, is called a world period.' The identical process of the emergence of the life-stream from the highest level, its descent to the deepest depths and its return (the journey of the prodigal son), is repeated in all sub-cycles. In any particular cycle the outward journey begins at the least dense or most subtle manifestation of a chain, a round, or a race. This is invariably followed by the return from the densest to the most refined plane of nature and the most spiritual condition of con­ sciousness. The powers contained in the Monads, or seeds of life, are latent at the opening of the cycle and active at its close. Such is a macrocosmi c or universa l interpretation of the great parable. The microcosmic application of this principle of forthgoing and return-the theme of the parable-is that each single Monad completes all the sevenfold cycles of the planetary scheme which has been appointed as its evolutionary field. The shortest, but not the least impo rtant, of all these cycles consists of a single physical incarnation. The journey of forthgo ing refers to the process of the descent of the human Ego from the plane of the abstract intellect, 1 The Solar System, A. E.

The return home begins at the death of the physical body and the gradual withdrawal of the per so nal soul, or incarnated egoic power, life and consciousness, back into the rein­ carnating Higher Self. In the initia tory reading of the parable the permanent realities have · been chosen, the path of discipleshi p entered upon, and the evolutionary process deliberately quickened to the limit of the in­ dividual's power. This occurs only at a c erta in phase (\"I will arise\") of the pathway of return, when materialism is outgrown and the \"husks\" are kn own for what the y are. Conscious reabsorp­ tion into the one life, light and power of the universe is then un­ known and sought as the true goal of human existence. The illusion of self-separateness begins to be outgrown. Universalization of con­ sciousness is achieved in due course and, since it is the natural, inborn condition of the Monad, this state is correctly descr i bed as \"the father's home\". Such, brie fly stated, appears to be the central message of the parable of the Prodigal Son, and such are some of its ma j or and minor applications. His Father Rum lo Ueet Him, Warmly Welco mes and KiBsea Him Profoundly occult macroco smic and microcosmic processes are al le g oric all y described by the father's haste to meet his son and by his compassion, a ff ec t ion and kiss. In gene r a l , the continually exerted spiritual izing influence of the First Aspect of the Logos (the father) upon the whole universe and its evolving l if e (the son) is described. More particularly , the forthg oing life-stream emanates from the Second Aspect of the Blessed Trinit y , the cos­ mic Christos or Son. When the pathway of r eturn has been fol­ lowed to a certain po int, a d t- -s c e nt of spiritualizing power occurs from the First Aspect of the Deity (his father runs to meet him). A m acrocosmic example of this descent of spiritual power is found in the pr oc ess known as the i n div idua lizati on into a human Ego of the hitherto universalized life ami consciousness ensouling the physical bodies of animals.

On the contrary, many monadic radiations are included within what is called a \"group soul\", which in its turn finds embodiment in large numbers of animals. In the case of wild beasts, particularly of the smaller variety, some thousands of bodies may be thus en­ souled. As an animal's evolution proceeds and domestication is entered upon, the number of such bodies comprisin g a group soul decreases. This culmi nates in the development by a single domes­ ticated animal of a high degree of intelligence and devotion, usually evoked by close contact with the animal's evolutiona ry senior, which is man. At this stage the group soul itself, within its superphysical envelope, begins to be divided by partitions, until the condition is approximated of a single monadic ray being manifest in a single domestic animal. Thereupon the process called indivi dualization occurs. As the animal \"reaches up\" in devotion, love and effort to understand and obey its master or mistress, a descent of power from the First Aspect of the Blessed Trinity is evoked or induced. This power \"rusres down\" to meet the upreaching feeling and thought-the simile of the formation of a water spout over the sea is used to describe the proce ss-and the two become conjoined (the father kisses him). The group soul envelope is then disrupted, and its substance used to form the causal body of the human Ego which has been \"born\" or brought into existence by this process.1 Thus, as is also the case in all inspired allegories in which similar reunions occur, the father's haste to meet the returning prodigal son, and especiall y his kiss, refer macrocosmically to the conjoining of the returning life-stream of the Second Logos with the descending, fructifying power of the First Aspect of the Blessed Trinity. In the sacred langua ge, macrocosmically the kiss of love is an oft-used symbol for the intima te touch of the power of the First Aspect of the Logos (the father) upon the returning life of the Sec­ ond Aspect (the son). In the initiatory interpretation the kiss symbolizes the descent into the candidate of the monadic will-force, both directly and through the hierophant, his voice and the thyrsus, at valid rites of initiation.

In the bodily sense, after death the Ego (father of the personality) \"meets\" the purely personal soul (the prodigal son) and draws all that is egoic into itself and its body of light, the causal body (the father's home). In the initia tory sense, for every step which an aspirant to dis­ cipleship takes toward his Master, the Master takes two steps toward him. At initiation the monadic power flashes down into the ego in the causal body, as heretofore described. As stated in Part Three of this volume, there resides within the physical body of man a normally latent, fiery power which, when awakened, moves through the body along a serpentine path. This power is referred to, therefore, as the serpent fire. At a certain stage of evolution, and at a certain phase in the rite of initiation, this fire is aroused into supernormal activity. When such awakening is about to occur, this monadic will-force descends through the crown of the head and spinal cord to the sacral chakra. By its fiery touch or \"kiss\" the will-force awakens the sleeping serpent fire which, as previously described, divides into three differently polarized currents which ascend along three appointed etheric canals associated with the spinal cord. When they reach and vivify the brain and certain or­ gans in it the personal soul is freed from the limitations of the body, which it can thereafter leave at will to ascend into full ex­ perience of its true egoic life in the higher mental world, its \"home\". The touch of the descendin g will-fo rce upon the sleeping serpent fire is also symbolized by a kiss. Indeed, all kisses and unions, legal or illicit, used in the sacred languag e refer to these various spiritual and occult actions and experiences, and more espec ially to those which occur on the initiatory path. A purely mystical interpretation is possible of the father's haste to meet his son, and of his kiss.

The Passion of Christ, which began in Gethsemane and ended with his death on Golgotha, is descriptive partly of this process and partly of the forceful dissolu tion of the last remaining vestiges of the illusion of sell-separated individuality. The apostle Paul, thought to have been an initiate of the Eleusinia, partly on the grounds of occult tradition and partly on internal evidence contained in his writings, in which he uses phrases from mystery rituals, also expresses contrition in his words: \"For 1 am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because 1 persecuted the church of God.\"1 This humility is repeated in his Epistle to the Ephesians: \"Unto me, wl:!o am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ.\"2 The Father Said, \"'Bring Forth the Be�l Robe\" 3 New garments are symbols of a renewed and expanded state of consciousness.

The seamless coat of Christ1 may be interpreted as the garment of the cosmic Christos, which is physical nature, and mor e especially its etheric counterpart which binds all atoms into a unity. The \"parting\" of the garments of Christ refers to the apparent division of the one life to become the ensoul­ ing principle of innumerable forms. To the spiritually unillumined observer-in the sacred language a blind man-variet y and individ­ uality appear to characterize physical nature in all her kingdoms. Illuminati, however, perceive also the oneness of the indwelling life. The dividing of the garments of Jesus into \"four parts, to every soldier a part\",2 also refers to the fourfold nature of the physical universe, which is composed of the four elements of earth, water, air and fire and, in addition, extends to the four quarters of the compass. Clothing is a symbol, too, of the limitation which every vehi­ cle inevitably puts upon consciousness. This fetter can be accentu­ ated by the development of erroneous ideas, theories and habits. It can be cast off by obtaining and accepting true knowledge, which produces right conduct. Symbolically, new robes are put on. The limiting, cloying garment is then transformed into \"garments of salvation\", a new \"robe of righteousne ss.\"3 In the Hindu Scripture, The Bhagavad Purana, the Lord Shri Krishna, as a child of nine, steals and hides the clothing of the bathing shepherdesses or Gopis (personal souls), aad forces them to come to him for its ret urn. Garments here symbolize passions, desires and prideful ness. These errors must be laid aside before clear vision can be attained. This sell-denudation is aided by the illuminating influence of the Spiritual Soul (Shri Krishna ), when once its interior presence has been realized and surrendered to. The action of Shri Krishna in permitting the Gopis to receive the gar­ ments from his hands indicates that the lower vehicles and their undesirable qualities had been purified and transmu ted by being submitted to his influence. 1 Jn. 19' 23. � Jn. 19:23. 3 \"· 61 :1 0."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"184 THE HIDDEN WISDOM IN THE HOLY BIBLE In general, a new or cleansed robe signifies the reconstituted body in which consciousness is clothed after having attained to fruitfulness at any level.

When these are purified or \"washed\" by the inspiring and enlightening action of the Christ principle within, then complete self-purification has been achieved. Since the feet arc the means of physical progress and desire is the driving force of many human actioRs, the allegory extends the process of purification into the raalm of emotion. The ancient writers would appear on occasion not to be above the use of a play on words. Thus the feet, by their supporting func­ tion as members of the body, refer to \"under stand ing\" or the intel­ ligent compre hension, and so conduct, of life . The attainment of this clear un derstaRdiRg is aided by the interior influence of the awakened Christ-na ture, allegoric ally portrayed in the incident of the purification or washiRg of the feet of his disciples by the Lord Christ This i·ncident will be more fully interpr�:ted from this point of view in its proper place in the progressive study of the Bible, of which this work consists. It is hoped, however, that tlle symbols, the methods of interpretation and the examples contained in this volume, will enable students to apply the principles to the great allegories of which the Bible consists. The possession of new shoes might also suggest !:hat the power to move onward into a new cycle has been developed. The incident therefore suggests that throughout the universe the inertia of matter has been overcome, or rather changed to mobility. The father's action in celebrating the return of the prodigal son by pro­ viding new shoes, refers to the fact that there is no ultimate, final cessation of cyclic activity. Eternal progr ession is the order of crea­ tive day. After the close of every cycle, forces are set in motion to carry the harvested fruits as seed-powers on into the next cycle. 1 Jn. 13:1-15."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"THE PATH WAY OF RETURN 189 When the vehicles of the preceding cycle have been laid aside ot its completion, the Monad -Ego or microcosm receives a new set us means of further material progress (shoe s). The left and the right shoe may possibly refer to feminine and masculine incarna­ tions respectively. The provision of new shoes suggests that both forms of egoic self-expression, the negative and the positive, have become purified, spiritualized, or renewed. The harmonizing or bal­ nncing of the components of the pairs of oppos ites in human nature ond conduct might also be indicated by the gift of two slightly dif­ fering objects which compose a pair. At initiation, which marks both the completion of one phase of human evolution and entry upon its successor, the existing causal body is disint egrated, a new one being instantly formed to serve as a vehicle to convey the Monad- Ego through its next evolu­ tionary phase. In addition, those initiates who on the attainment of ndeptship decide to retain p hysical bodies, subject them to an occult process of purification and rejuvenation, so that the normal onset of death is delayed. When, however, physical death does occur, certain of the subtler v e h i c l e s are materialized to the physi­ cal level. This provides the Adept with a relatively immonal physi­ cal body. Although the appearance of such renewed bodies may not be greatly changed, their substance and condition are so al­ tered, and the change is so carefully maintained thereafter, that longevity far beyond the allotted span is achieved. Since the attain ­ ment of adeptship marks the completion of the purely human cycle of existence, the return of the prodigal son may analogically be compared to it. Similarly, the putting on of new shoes may sym­ bolize the process of bodily renewal. The Falted Calf Bulls, oxen, cows and calves are, in general, symbols of the masculine and feminine divine creative potencies. Bulls, with their Immense virility, are appropriate physical symbols-for spirit, or the masculine creativ e potency, and for the male participant in all generative processes. Cows, with their fertility and their production of the nutrient substance of milk, are appropriate physical symbols for substance, the matter of space, the feminine creative potency, ond for the female participant in all generative proce sses. The cow"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"190 TifE HIDDEN WISDOM IN THE HOLY BIBLE thus suggests both the infinite reproduc tiveness of matter and the fertility of nature, which perpetually provides an abundance of food. The cow is therefore regard ed as the prolific image of the earth, or mother nature, who prov ides food, strength, health and happiness. The calf potentially possesses one or other of the above-men­ tioned attributes, but more especially symbolizes the product of the creative interaction of the father-mother, and is therefore a symbol of both the universe and all to which it gives birth. Macrocosmically, eating the fatted calf indicates absorption into the divine Source of all the powers resulting from the involu­ tionary and evolutionary processes at the close of a major cycle. When a calf is new-born, creative dawn is implied. When i t is grown and fatte ned, approach to the close of an evolutionary cycle is indicated, and eating it symbolizes the fiaal garnering of all the fruits of the period of manifestation. In man, the microcosm, the calf is a symbol of the intuitive wisdom which is \"born\" from the fructify ing descent of spiritual will (the bull) into the vehicle of abstract intelligence, the causal body (the cow). From this union the intellect becomes illumined by the light of pure reason and spiritual intuitiveness (conce ption ), while from then on the higher vehicle, the body of intuition, de­ velops into an effective instrument of supra-mental cognition, of direct perception and implicit insight into first truilis a n d first causes. The fatte ned condition also signifies the fuNncss of compre­ hension and of knowledge which the awakened principle of spirit­ ual intuition bestows upon the mind of man. The enrichment of soul which comes from the acco mpanying upwel ling of divine life and love is also implied. In the human interpr etation, then, the f a t te d calf indicates that phase of egoic evolutioa at which the intuitioa, or buddhic vehicle, has developed into an effe ctive in­ strument of conscio us·Ress, its eff.icacy having been enhanced by the transmuted personal forces of love and desire. The process of eati.ng the fatted calf-and indeed all sym­ bolical feasts - indicates U1at the center of awareness has been raised above the lower quaternary and established a t spiritual levels above the intel lectual principle, and that it there absorbs (feasts"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"THE PATHWAY OF RETt:RN 191 upon) the enriching fruits provided by the exercise of the faculty of intuition. The molten ca!P-to digress briefly-would signify the devel­ opment and expression of the forces of desire, chiefly through the emotional and physical bodies. The Psalmist says: \"They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image. Thus they changed their glory into the simil itude of an ox that eateth grass.\"' Acceptance of the literal reading of the Script ures, apart from the unde rmeaning, and insistence upon the efficacy of mere outer forms and ceremonies, apart from the inner life, are symbolized by a molten calf. While at first there must be reliance upon external guidance, even authority, and upon outer observance (the molten calf), the spiritual truth and power behind the veil of symbolism and ceremony must eventually be perceived. The molten calf sym­ bol therefore describes the condition of the man who has not yet begun those interior proces ses of spiritual alchemy whereby the forces and faculties of desire and generation become transmu ted into the powers of spiritual will, spirit ual wisdom and intellectual creativeness, or genius. \"Let Us Eat, and Be IUerrym In the spiritual sense a feast symbolizes absorption of the fruitage of any cycle of activity, macrocosmic and microcosmic, major and minor. Eating and drinking refer to assimilation, whether of power, wisdom, knowledge or, in the larger sense, of the now active and well-developed powers which were latent at the begin­ ning of the process. Thus the fruits of the voyage, the pilgrima ge, the journey, are said to be gathered, prep ared, and enjoyed as a feast. The powers, the faculties, the wisdom and the knowledg e developed when the end of any cycle is reached are absorbed and assimilated in a state of blissful fulfillment. For the time being nothing is lacking, all is attained. The journey of forthgo ing and return has come to an end. In this sense Isaiah wrote: \"And in this mountain shall the Lord of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees I Ex. 32:4. 2 Ps. 10 6: 1 9-20. a Lk. 15:2 3."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"192 THE HIDDEN WISDOM IN THE HOLY BIBLE well refined.\"' Indeed, the whole of the twenty-fifth chapter of Isaiah abounds in descriptions of macr ocosmic and microcosmic attainments written io the symbolical lan guage. To sum up, all banquets symboliz e the completed, \"fulfilled\" state which has been reached at the end of a cycle. In terms of one human incarnation, full majority is implied. The rich experiences of life, and the wisdom and the understanding obtained from them, have all b�en absorbt:d by the min d-brain. If applied to the life of the sanctuary, the eating of the fatted calf, the feasting and the merrymaking are all descriptive of a state of consciousness entered into as the final initiation draws ncar-that act of self-liberation which makes a man an Adept. The Last Supper,' and the accepted invitation to \"Come and dine\"3 given by our Lord to the disciples on the occasion of his third appearance after the Resurrection, may refer to this consum­ mation, also symbol ized b y the Ascension of Christ. St. John alone narrates this incident and since his Gospel is full of mystic allu­ sions, the macrocosmic and microcosmic significations of agape may have been in his mind. The wedding feasts of Jacob,4 of Sa m­ son, 5 of Esther,0 and at Cana,7 are especially susceptible of this interpretatio n. The Elder Son W tU Angry The suggestion of jealousy between different aspects of the Divine Na ture, and between Monads evolving through the angelic and the human kingdoms, is unacceptable. The anger of the elder son may therefore be taken as a deliberate blind or cover to dis­ tract the attention of the profane from the deeper aspects of the secret wisdom, and the power which follows from their discovery. Microcosmi cally, the two brothers may be regarded as the two aspects-the higher, abstract (the elder) and the lower, con­ crete (the young er)-o f the human mind. In the earlier phases of human evolution the concrete, mental principle becomes enmeshed and entrapped in the transient phenomena of the ephemeral phys- 1 \"· 23:6. 2 Mau. 26: 20-29. 3 Jn. 21: 12-IJ .

Eventually however, their illusory, transitory and so unsatisfying (famine and hung er) nature is perceived and they are outgrown and forsworn (\"1 will arise\"), later to be replaced by the true riches of the soul. These consist severally of spiritual powers, wis­ dom, knowledge, and the enduring happi ness and satisfaction (merrymaking and feasting on the fatted calf) which their posses­ sion and exercise bestow. Thus, that which hitherto was lower, prodigal (wasted by riotous living), worldly, is transformed into a purely selfless and spiritual state of consciousness and mode of life (fed from the paternal Source). When this sublimation has occurred, the higher and the lower minds are united to become one intellectual principle. This is then capable of awareness and action in both the \"formless\"' worlds of ubstract truths and laws and the \"form\"' worlds of mental analysis and separate evolving forms. Thus, at the end of the great pilgrim­ age the younger and the elder brother are correctly brought to­ gether in the father's home. In terms of the evolution of the spiritual Soul and its succes­ sive personal ities, the union of the two brothers refers to the fusion of egoic and personal consciousness. When this has been attained the reincarnating Ego, represented by the elder brother, becomes fully aware of all the experiences of its projected ray (younger brother) which has made the pilgrimage through the worlds of form (successive reincarnatio ns), has received the stain or imprint of matter, and has now become self-purified from it. The personal soul is then consciously united with its Higher Self (the father). The prodigal son has returned home. Although it may appear to some minds to complicate unduly the beautifully simple parable, this interpretation is supported by the reply of the father to the elder son: \" ...

In meanin gs applicable to the parable of the Prodigal Son, states of consciousness rather than bodily conditions are described. Death implies complete, though temporary, loss by the present, mortal man of experience of the divine and immortal nature of his true Self. Resurrection, or being alive again, is descriptive of rediscov­ ery of this knowledge and re-entry into that experience. Similarly, being lost in no sense implies finality, but only a state of mind in which the delusion of being a self-separated personality temporarily inhibits spiritual experien ce and comprehension, particularly of unity with God. To have been found again is to have been deliv­ ered from this delusion or \"heresy\" of separateness and once more to have become aware of identity with God, and through him with all that lives. Fall and Redemption The ideas of the \"Fall\" of man, the curse of Eve, the brand of Cain, and the equally erroneous concept of original sin, have arisen from a misu nderstanding, if not complete ignorance, of the theme of the parable of the Prodigal Son. As suggested throug hout this interpretat ion, the parable describes the journey of spirit out­ wards from the Source on the path of forthgoing, and inwards to the Source on the path of return. Spirit, while re maining perfect in its own world, inevitably becomes marked or stained by contact with matter, especia lly in its grosser densities.

The illusion of self­ separateness, individualism, pride, sensuality and sexuality-these constitute the inescapable price which, in the current period of the evolution of the planet earth and its inhabi tants, must be paid for the attainment of adeptship. This price-the descent and the resultant staining-is referred to in many ways by writers who use the allegorical language. Some of the biblical symbols used to denote it are: the \"Fall\", the sin of Adam and Eve, the brand of Cain, the bruised heel, the descents into Egypt and Babylon, the pit and the prison into which Joseph was thrown, the idolatry of David, the surrender of Samson (the Ego) to Delilah and the Philistines (the emotional and the physical natures of man), the accusations of the elder brother of the prodi­ gal son, and the death and burial of Christ. Mythology contains many allegories susceptible of a similar interpretation. Among them are: the temp orarily earth-bin ding errors of Lucifer, and the vulnerability both of Achilles, whose mother failed to allow the water to wash the heel by which she held him head downward (symbol of the path of forthg oing) in the sacred waters of the River Styx, and of Siegfried at the place where the leaf fell on his back while he was bathing in the dragon's blood. Although the spiritual Soul of man is eternal and immortal, his bodily nature (heel and place on the back) is mortal and even­ tually dies. The \"accidental\" arrow wound of which Shri Krishna died, and the wounds of Balder, Adonis and Osiris, as well as the shirt of Nessus which brought about the agonizing death of Hera­ cles, are all symbols of the temporary ill-effects upon spirit of its Intimate contact with matter. These and the many similar stories are instructive examples of the use of allegory to conceal, preserve, or reveal to intuitive minds, profound truths concerning the underlying Jaws which gov­ ern cosmic and human existence. Simil arly, as stated in an earlier chapter, human procreative activity, whether legal or ill icit, has two symbolic meanings. One of these is the same as that given to the above allegories.

Another meaning of such unions applies to experiences upon the path of return, when the personal consciousness (the male in this sense ) becomes fused with that of the Ego (fema le), and that mystical union occurs which is also re­ ferred to as the \"heavenly marriage.\" If it be asked why the ancient authors should thus introduce the obscene into their writings on spiritual subjects, it is replied that to them human procreation was in no sense obscene. On the contrary, they regarded it as a perfectly legitimate and natural human enactment of the divine creative procedure by which, in the larger sense, the univers e was created. In modem man, passing through the present mental cycle, such references admittedly tend to evoke the blush of shame and the altogether unjustified sense of obscenity. Such, however, was not the case among earlier races of mankind, and in the days when many such stories were written. If the necessity for this veiling be questioned, it should be remembered that the discovery of the unity of the microcosm (man) with the macrocosm (the universe) could bestow very great theurgic powers upon the disc overer. These could be misused with grave detriment to both the transgressor and all others adversely affected. Black magic is, in fact, one example of such misuse of knowledge. Further reasons for secrecy concerning occult knowl­ edge and power are presented in an earlier chapter. \"All That I Have u Thine\" 1 The father's gentle reproof, and his attempt to appease the elder son by assuring him that \"all that I have is thine,\" constitute an affirmation of the eternal truth that fundamentally all beings are expressions of the one divine life. In consequence, all the appar­ ently separate manifestations of that one life participate in each other's attainments. Further more, the human Monad receives all the fruits of egoic evolution while the Ego, in its turn, absorbs into itself and stores the powers, the wisdom, the knowledge and the faculties developed by its successive physical personalities.

This is the evolutionar y goal, the crown of him who has been crucified, whether he be the cosmic Christos, the historical Christ, or the Christ principle indwelling in every man. When the great mystical coronation1 occurs, the elevated and liber­ ated one is able to say with the Christ : \"I and my Father are one'',' and with the prodigal son's father to his elder son: \" ... thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine.\" Such are possible interpretations of the great parable, par­ ticularly when it is regarded as an expositio n of the law of cycles by which all existe nce is governed. t The uni11u m i n e d masses see only the trials and ordeals throuKh which, In hJs purely human nature. the triumphant anitiate must pass.

In this chapter three possible inter pretations of certain incidents in the life of Christ are offered. The narrative is treated as a record of universal truths and mystical experiences passed through by races and individuals. The immortal story is considered from three points of view : the universal, in which the Christ personifies the creative Deity and his outpoured life; the human, in which Christ represents the spirit of man on its pilgrim­ age towards perfec tion; the spiritual, in which the progress of the man Jesus through the five great initiati ons to adeptship mirrors the self-same experiences through which every initiate has passed and must pass when treading the Way of the Cross. Of these the last-mentioned, referred to throughout as the initiatory interpreta­ tion, is the most fully expounded and most frequently repe ated­ because considered to be of especial interest and importance. A study of the Gospels from these points of view indicates that they were written by men who knew the Ancient Wisdom and were skilled in the language of allegory and symbol. These inspired authors would seem to have been initiated members of one or other of the still-operative sanctuaries of the mysteries of their time and, knowing the sacred language, they used actual people and tem­ poral happenings, substances and forms as symbols of eternal truths. 198"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"THE NATIVITY 199 While for man y Christians the Gospel story in its wonder and beauty is all-sufficient, there are others who, noting certain mysteri­ ous events and words of Our Lord, perceive in the narra tive a mystery, a light and a truth greater even than those of the historical account. Our Lord s a i d , for examp le: \"I and my Father are one\";' \"Before Abraham was, I am\";2 and in the Book of Revelation he is made to say: \"I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.\"3 These words can hardly refer to th e man Jesus who was born in Bethlehem. Indeed, St. John opens his wonderful Gospel by referring to him as the creative \"Word\" which was in the beginning,• and later was made flesh and dwelt among us, \"and the life was the light o f m e n . \"4 That a mystery is hidden deep within the Gospel story and in the nature of the Lord Jesus Christ is evident. Thus, while the historicity of the Bible is not contested, the idea is advanced that the related incidents have both a temporal, historical significance and a timeless meaning, universal and human. The great central figure in the Gospels thus assumes a cosmic grandeur and univer­ sality. Mystically he represents the divine life and presence in all nature and in all men. The main events recorded of him are seen also as events occurring in the whole unive rse and within the spiritual Soul, or Christ, in man. In a mystery beyond human comprehens ion, the Christ story is that both of the cosmos and of every human being. It tells of the birth and the evolution to rela­ tive perfection of the whole universe, the human race, and every human individual. Indeed, three Christs can be discerned in the Gospel narrative. These are: the cosmic-the deific life and presence in all nature and all things; the mystical, or the Christ-presence in every human being; and the historical, the great figure who appeared on earth some 2,000 years ago in Palestine. In the cosmic interpretation, the major cycle of forthgoing and return is portrayed. At the cosmic Nativity the life of the creative Deity is oulpourcd into the newly formed, or new-born, universe.

Every human spirit, or Monad, pursues the same outward and returning path upon its pilgrimage from mnocence or sleep (as in the incident of the stilling of the tempe st), outward and down­ ward into.con flict with matter and the elemental tendencies of the substance of the mental, the emotional and the physical bodies (the storm on Galilee and the temptation in the wilderness ), overcomes them, and molds them into the wings of the Soul whereby it ascends to that peace from whence it came forth.

This Ego repeats the great cycle, lives out the story of the life of Christ every time it descends into incarnation as a divine visitant to the physical world. Thus the inner Self of mao is born (Nativit y), reaches puberty (Baptism), is tempted and when suc­ cessful overcomes, is crucified by suffering, and knows the death of the body and its own resurrection and ultimate return to the Egoic world. Thus the Christ-life is indeed a universal life. The Christ himself composed and related a wonderful epitome of the life story of cosmos, solar system, human race, human individual and human initiate.

In answer to his first question as to how he could a t t a i n to eternal life, he was told by o ur Lord to keep the commandments. He protested that this h e had done from his youth up. Then came the acid test. Our Lord said t o him: \" ... sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.\" Then follows what is surely one of the m os t poignant sentences in the whole of our Scriptures: \"And when he heard this, h e was very sorrowful : for he was very rich.\"1 We need not regard this decision us final, however.

The Phases of the Interior Unfoldment The five major stages in the life of our Lord are passed through by every aspirant to perfection; for the Nativity, the Bap­ tism, the Transfiguration, the Crucifixion and the Ascension of Christ, as recorded in the Gospels, portray by allegory and symbol the experiences of every human being who at any time finds the Master's feet.

I travail In birth again until Christ be formed in you.\"2 The prophecies in the Old Testament are followed by the mission of John the Baptist, whose call to the people of his time to repent is interpreted as the voice of the Higher Self of man; a voice which, if heeded, eventu­ lllly becomes the impelling summons of a fully-awakened con­ •cience. The daily life is then purified of selfishness, sensuality and •elf-indulgence. Possessiveness begins to be outgrown and service un behalf of others assumes an increasingly large place in the life uf the aspirant.

If one may say so, with deepest rever­ ence for her as an historical personage, she is also a p ersonification of the immortal, spiritual Soul of all men, the maternal matrix or womb from within which the Christ-power and Christ-c onscious­ ness, ot child, is interiorly born. This reading of the story, as being descriptive of interior ex­ periences and develo pments of one person, is borne out by the statement that Joseph, the husband of Mary, was not the father of Jesus, who was immaculately born of a virgin mother.• Many earn­ est Christians find this doctrine of the immaculate conception dif­ ficult to accept. The difficult y vanishes, however, if the story is re­ garded not as history only, but also as an allegorical description of changes and developments occurring within the mind and heart of every human being. The Annunciation The Archangel Gabriel represents the Innermost Spirit in man. Mary is the immortal Soul, receptive to the power of the spirit; and the Christ-child who is born of Mary is the Christ-consciousness within man, the newly awakened powers of un iversal love and spir­ itual intuitiveness which reveal to the mind the oneness of all life and all living things. Thus the Annunciation is an interior experi­ ence, a descent from the Dweller in the Innermost-the Monad, the source of creative will (Gabricl )-<Jf fructifyi ng power, sometimes pictured as a lily, symbol of generation and regeneration.

Within that body the whole wonderful transforma­ tion occurs. The symbolism here is especially interesting, as it would seem that the Evangelists delibe rately introduced personifica­ tion of the bodies of man. The prepared and receptive mind is represented by Joseph; the purified emotions by the tamed domestic animals; and the physical body by the inn and its stable. Indeed, all of the seven principles of man are thus personified and present in the allegory of the Nativity of Christ. This is the universal virgin birth in the advanced individual and race, the first great initiation, the true Christmas of the Soul. It is beginning to occur in the more advan ced lllements of the huma nity of this day, those men and women who are responsible for world movements which seek international collaboration for the welfare of the race as a whole. As ever, a Herod appears in the guise of those dark fanatics of selfishness, the ruthless tyrants in every field of human endeavor who seek to frustrate and destroy the dawning impulse to world unity, even as King Kamsa sought the death of the child Shri Krishna, Seth of Horus, the Titans of Bacchus, and Herod of Jesus. As all of thos.e personifications escaped and rose to great­ ness, so will the great allegories prove to be true descriptions of the successful birth of the Christ-consciousness in twentieth century man. Such is the racial interpretation of which aU allegories are susceptible. The Mystical Accolade In the ancient mysteries , as stated elsewhere, the physical body was entranced. The inner Self in its vehicle of light, the causal body, was thus freed and thereafter elevated to a level of awareness at which the existence of the one Source of all life, and unity with that Ji.fe, arc recognized. At that level of awareness this unity is no longer an intellectual concepHon, but is now a living truth, felt and known from within rather than seen from without. The real significance of the mystical Nativity is interior, intellectual, psychological self-identification with others in various states of happiness, sorrow and suffering.

In recording these profound mysteries of initiation, the Evangelist s revealed them in terms of analogy and symbol. The secrecy to which all initiates are pledged, as indicated by the pos­ ture of Horus Harpocrates, is thus prese rved: while at the same time, and with cons.ummate skill, a measure of the truth is pre­ sented to those that have eyes to see and ears to hear. The actual revelation, however, consists not of imparted information but of direct, personal, interior experience, and this is for ever incom­ municable. The way to it can, however, be indicated and this is the great value of the inspired Scriptures of the world. The great ceremony of initiation eventually draws to a close. The Soul returns to its body. The expansion of consciousness and its results must be transmitted to mind, emotion and brain, through which they must be made manifest in the conduct of daily life. Tlte Holy Family The int erior birth is indeed immaculate; for in this reading of the Gospel story Joseph represents the formal, logical, concrete mind of an advanced human being, experienced and wise• before, and spiritually illumined after, the mystical Nativity. Valuable though the formal mind with its powers of logic can be, it cannot give birth to the intuition. By its very nature it is mentally analy­ tical and factual. The intuition, represented by the Christ-child, brings swift realization of underlying principles and accurate pre­ monitions which are independent of the action of the formal mind. The immo rtal Self, personified by Mary, with its capacity for ab­ stract thought, can receive, comprehend and convey to the formal mind (give birth to) this intuitive power. Thereafter the revelations of the intuition are justified at the bar of the intell ect, their expres­ sion in action being guided by a wise and balanced mind. Joseph, then, person ifies the developed mind of the candidate for initiation and is rightly only the putative foster-fath er of Jesus. Domestic animals were assumed to be present at the Nativity.

The stable in its turn represents the physical body. Thus, in the language of sym­ bols and with the greatest skill, the whole of man-his spiritual, in­ tellectual, emotional, vital and physical principles-is introduced into the wonderful story of the historical Nativity. This story is so related as to reveal in addition profound mysti cal truths of uni­ versal significance. The Shepherds and the 1llagi The shepherds refer to those great Shepherds of Souls who are the perfected men of our earth, hum anity's Elder Brethren, the rare efflorescence of the human race. The apostle Paul writes of them as the \"just men made perfect\",1 and displays in many ways a knowledge of the mystical meaning of the Gospel story . The shepherds are ri gh tly introduced into the story of the Nativity; for whenever a human being reaches the evolut ionary stage at which the Christ-power is born within him, he is drawn into the presence of these Great Ones of the earth, man's seniors in evolution. A great ceremonial is performed in their presence after divine assent has been rece ived. The shepherds are therefore included in the Rtory to make of it also a description of what is called the initiation of man. The Magi or Kings from the East, traditionally three in num­ her, are variously interpreted by Biblical scholars. In one sense they refer to the three aspects of the inner, immortal Self of man, which are spiritual will, spiritual wisdom and spiritual intelligence. Ench of thes e parts of the Soul . of man is at that time sufficiently uwakened to contribute its special powers or gifts to empower, guide and inspire the initi ate in the new life into which he enters. In another rendering the three Ma gi refer to the purified mind, e�motions and bodily powers of the initiate, whose sublimated facul­ lics (the gifts ) are offerad or surrender!ld to �he Christ-power which is now awake within him. Symbo lically, the thme gifts are luid at the feet of the newly-illumined Soul, or Christ-child newly horn.

It is the sign and symbol that the necessary powers and qualities, especially selflessness, have been attained and that initiation may be conferred. The Mauacre of the lnnocenu Herod represents the past, the infant Christ represents the future, and between these two a measure of warlare is inevita ble. Old appetites, habits, self-indulgences, selfishnesses, and a mate­ rialistic and purely worldly and acquisitive attitude, toward life, are incompatible with the life of loving and sacrificial service which will now be lived. The initia te may therefore, at first, experience some difficulty in subduing the clamorous demands of the body and the jealous, prideful, possessive attributes of the mind, which are symbolized by Herod. This aspect of human nature (the Herod in man) will lose its power if the Christlike attitude is allowed to develop. The loss is subconsciously resented by the outer man, who makes every endeavor to prevent the dominance of the new, spir­ itual ideal. Symbolically, Herod massacres the innocents in an endeavor to destroy the new-born Christ-child. The Flight Into Egypt The Hight to Egypt is of great interest to symbologists, for again the whole make-up of man is present, all the seven parts of human nature being portrayed. Joseph, Mary and the Christ-child here personify the threefold Spiritual Self of man, the human re­ flection of the Blessed Trinity of Father, Son and Holy Ghost. The four lower parts of human nature-mind, emotion, vitality and flesh (the lower quaternary, as it is called) -are frequently sym­ bolized by a quadruped. The normally stubborn ass is chosen as the beast of burden, both for the flight to Egypt and the entry into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, thus fulfilli ng the Old Testament prophecy : \" .•. shout, 0 daughter of Jerusal em: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: ... lowly, and riding upon an ass . .. \"1 This is a very apt choice from the symbolical point of view; for the more material aspects of man's nature, the lower quaternary, tend stubbornly to res ist the 1 Zech. 9:9 ."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"THE NAriVITY 209 will of the spirit within him. When once the Spiritual Self has be­ come dominaRt, however, then the obstinate and self-willed attri­ butes are transformed into docility. The outer man becomes obedi­ ent to the will within. This tamed, fourfold personality is well represented by the symbol of a domesticated quadruped, the hith­ erto stubbom donkey now trained to willing service. Why was the so-called flight to Egypt made? The suggestion of a flight may be regarded as a cover for the true purpose of the journey. Although a spiritually minded man may ignore his ene­ mies, both without and within, and may even make tactical with­ drawals in order later to advance, he would not be likely to fly from them. The danger which threatened Jesus in Palestine and the so-called flight to Egypt may be interpreted as descriptive of the pr0cess of the transmutation of spiritually dangerous personal at­ tributes and tcnd cacies, personified by Herod, into their sublim ated, positive expression as spiritua l and intel'lectual powers. Occult tra­ dition records that Jesus did actually make a journey to Egypt. This is one of the many instances where historical fact and mystical interpretation are formed into a narrative where both local, tem­ poral facts and eternal truths are revealed; for Egyp t is regarded by some modern students of occultism as a still-operating sanctu­ ary of the greater mysteries, where initiations continue to be con­ ferred and inspiration bestowed by the still-living Masters, who form the Egyptian Branch of the Great Brotherhood of the Adepts on our planet. Egypt was one of those sacred places on earth where sanctuaries of the greater mysteries had long been estab­ lished.

A second, solemn ceremonial is performed, a new level of consciousness is attained, and a new spiritual power and authority is the result. The intellectual principle in man receives an evol utionary stimu lus, and this makes danger­ ous the period which immediately follows . The analy tical faculty is greatly enhanced and can for a time shut out from the mind the spiritual wisdom derived from the supra-mental, intuitive levels of consciousness. The outer personality can then become hypercritical, scornful, and even materialistic. This is symbolized in the Gospel story by the wilderne ss into which Jesus was led after his Baptism to be tempted of the devil,2 who then symbolizes the prideful, scorn ful, materialistic aspects of the formal mind, as also does one of the thieves at the Crucifixion. The interior, mystical interpretation of the Baptism of Jesus indicates that it refers to an important phase in the unfoldment of man's higher faculties; for spiritually minded people, and the dis­ ciples and initiates among men, are all of them potential servants and saviors of mankind . In order that they may be able to teach man the way of happiness, health and harmony, and so that they may have the power and the knowledge to heal the sicknesses of human bodies, hearts and minds, they must themselves experience 1 Mall. l: IJ-17. 2 Mall. 4; 1-11. 210"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"FROM BAPTISM TO ASCENSION 211 those suiTerings.

The Temptation in the Wilderness The story of the temptation of Jesus by the Devil in the wilder­ ncss3 portrays in part only, and in the langua ge of symbols, the experiences of the initiate of the second degree. Just as, after the Nativity, the attack was made by Herod, symbolizing the clamor of past habits and desires, so now the remainiag vestiges of pride, egoism, self-satisfaction and desire for power, persoaified as Satan, tend to spring to life and tempt the initiated one to abandon his divine mission. Allegorically, in the wilderness-repr esenting peri­ ods of spiritual aridity, to which all mystics bear tostimony - the !>evil templ � Jesus to abandon the great quest and to use his new­ round power to gain personal possessions and prestige.

It describes also the life of every human being; for, as has been previously suggested, all men experience on occasi on their spiritual or inward awakenings or \"births\". There are times in the lives of most people when they know a dissatisfaction with them­ selves as they are; when they experience what has been described as an inexpressible longing for the infinite, a divine discont ent. This almost universal human experience corresponds to the Nativity of Christ. Most pe()p!e also have their baptisms in the waters of sorrow, when grief, pain and despair can overwhelm them even as the waters of Jordan closed over Jesus. If, like him, they are steadfast, they emerge stronger, wiser, and able to heal the pains of others . Tempta tions in the wilderness, states of consciousness when spirituality seems far away, also assail mankind. The lower nature tempts man to betray the highest for personal gain, prestige and power. Again, those who conquer, as did Our Lord, and use their powers rightly, will bring about a renewal of the spiritual impulse. Sometimes this is so strong as to transform people's characters and lives, even as our Lord was transfigured on the mount. The Transfigur ation The temptation of Jesus, and his embarkation upon a life of ministra tion, were followed by ascent of the mount of Transfigura­ tion. As previously stated, in the sacred language the mount, upon which so many wonderful things are made to happen in the Bible, is a symbol for an exalted state of full, waking consciousness. So it is that the third of the great initiatory degrees is taken on the \"mount\", or lofty altitude of the higher consciousness.

There also, while thus exalted, the fulfillment of his own destiny as man, the attainment of the stature of the perfect man, is envisaged. Severe trials follow, among them those dark nights of the Soul in which the quint essence of loneliness is experienced. Such Gethsemanes are not unknown to many human beings who, in their time of great need, have found \"fast asleep\" those upon whom they had relied. In the darkest hours of human life, hours of solitude, isolation, defamation and betrayal, men have felt crucified, cut off from man and God, and as if their hearts were dead within them. Resurrec tion and Ascension from this darkness will follow, how­ ever, for those who endure faithfully to the end. In this way the life of Jesus the Christ is indeed a universal life, portraying the experiel'!ees of every human being. Thus it was that in the darkness of the Garden of Gethsemane, in the hour of his great need, Jesus found his disciples asleep. He knew then all that was before him; the betrayal, the mockery of t h e trial, the Crucifixion and the cruel death. Naturally he turned to those he loved and who loved him best, seeking some support from them in the great ordeal. But, as had to happen in order that he might learn to rely upon his own inwar d strength alone, all outer help was seemingly withdrawn. Allegorically, his disciples were sleeping around him, no hand being outstretched to help him in the hour of his need. Rarely, it is said, does a Soul pass through this trial without uttering the cry: \" ... could ye not watch with me one hour?\"' Then, despite a momentary shrinking of the human nature from the cup, it was accept ed. Already his face had been set stead­ fastly toward Jerusalem, symbol of the world that he was then to enter, in order that by knowledge and wisdom mankind may be delivered from sin and selfishness, and so from the suffering which under compensatory law they inevitably bring.

He drank the bitter d raug h t1 (whi ch is another wonderful symbol for the bitterness of defama­ tion and betrayal ). The Father, who was still realized in Gethsemane, was veiled on Golgotha in the passion of the Cross. From the heart which felt itself deserted there then rang o u t the cry: \"My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?\"� \"I And My Father Are One\"3 Why this last, dread ordeal? It is said to be necessary because the goal of human evolution is fully realized unity, and even identity, with God. The Adept-to-be must learn, and does learn, even in the agony of loneliness -i ndeed because of it- that h e is the Eternal and the Eternal is himself. Then he can say with full realization, as on a for mer occasion did our Lord: \"I and my Father ar e one.\"3 Thereafter, he remains beyond the possibility of any more falling under the illusion of separateness.

The title of \"hierophant\" is derived from the Greek word heiropha ntes, \"one who explains sacred things\", the discloser of secret l e arn i ng , the chitlf of t he initia tes. The Greek word teletai means both deaths a nd fin is h in §S or initiations. Candidates passed through the experience of bodily death, though the body still lived, while th e Soul was freed, traiRed to act and to observe in the superphysical worlds, and elevated to that level of consciousness at which oneness with the all-pervading divine life is known. The Soul was loosened from the body by the divine trance, in which complete self-consciousness in the higher worlds was attained and the occult senses opened. The Soul of the candi date was elevated and absorbed all the wisdom, power and purifying energy it could as s i mila te . It returned to the body, generally after three days and three nights, bridging death by means of the m y s t i c elixir of life th u s acquired. This experience was constantly repeated, higher levels of consciousness being reached and greater powers obtained on each occasion.

Veiled references to the rite of initiation, and to the secret knowledge imparted and acquired on passing through it, occur in both the Old and the New Testame nts. In the incident of Jonah and the great fish,1 certain symbols are used which suggest the description of an initiatory rite. The ship refers to the physical body out of which Jonah (the Soul ) was cast into the underworld portion of the plane of emotion (the sea), to be swallowed by a great fish (the Christ-consciousness of oneness with all beings ) and there to remain for three days and three nights, afterward to be deposited on dry land (returned to the physical body and world ). The universality of this experience of initiates is indicated by the words of Our Lord: \"For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the hear t of the earth. \" 2 An indirect reference to icitiation as the way of salvation from sin may also be implied by Our Lord's later reference to Jonah.3 These references will, how­ ever, be more fully considered in the later volumes of this work, wherein the books of the Bible in which they appear are interpreted. 1 !onolo 1:17. 2 Mart. 12:40. 3 Matt. 16:4."},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"CHAPTER II STEPS ON THE PATHWAY TO DIVINE MANHOOD As s t at e d earlier in this volume, a m o ng po ss i b le inter f)reta tions of the Bible there is one which provi des gui da nc e in tr e a d in g \"the w ay of holiness\",' the pathway of d is c i p l e s h i p and initiation le ad in g to th e hastened attainment of perfected manhood.

This mental condition has been described as \"the divine discontent\" and \"the inexpressible longing of the inner man for the infinite.\" From the earliest days of human life on this planet, men and women have known this discontent and have set forth upon the path of swift unfoldment, the way of life which will bring them rapidly to their goal. Some of these early aspirants succeeded, but only at the cost of tremendous effort and great suffering. In con­ sequence, they discovered ways or rules of life by means of which both the effort and the sufferings could be reduced to a minimum. Eventually all this knowledge became formulated into sets of rules, which were made available for the guidance of all who similarly aspire. These rules are known as the Laws of the Higher Life. In this chapter, however, I shall consider not so much the rules of the occult life as another codification, that of discipleship and initiation, also designed for the guidance of spiritually awakened men and women. This divides the process of deliberately hastened attainment into stages, at certain of which special laws come into operation and the aspirant is particularly susceptible to guidance from seniors. This systematiza tion, for which Tzong-ka-pa was largely respons ible in more modem days, has proved to be of immense value, if only in the avoidance of pitfalls, the reduction of suffering and the increase of the speed of attainment. Thus have come to be recognized what are known as official steps upon the path. These evolutionary phases and the experiences usually associ­ ated with them are not, however, limited to the life of the path . They are also rehearsed throughout the period of man's normal, natural evolution. In Christianity, for example, as described in Part Five of this book, the five major steps on the path are portrayed by means of allegories describing experiences throngh which Jesus passed - namely Nativity, Baptism, Transfigurat ion, Cruci.fixion and Ascension. Every human being repeatedly passes through these self-same experie nces before \"The way of holiness\" is entered upon. True, the degrees of expansion of consciousness, as also of strain and of suffering, are far less than when the path has been finally adopted as the only possible way of life. Neverthe­ less, all human beings have their conversions or new births, their"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"STEPS ON THE PATHWAY 223 baptisms in the waters of sorrow, their tempta tions and trials, as also their temporary upliftments when both they themselves, and the world in which they live, seem to be transfigured or trans­ formed. Gethsemane, the dark night of the Soul, is frequently experienced by both individuals and nations, as also are betrayal and unjust condemnation. These tribul ations can culminate in a sense of veritable cruci­ fixion when the quintessence of loneliness is known, as also are agonies of heartache, and even bodily pain. Wonderful recoveri es, ascensions from darkness, can lead to great happiness, while death itself- which comes to all - marks the ascension of the inner Self from the limitations of earthly life. These universal human experi­ ences may perhaps be usefully regarded for what they really are; for they are both results of the operation of the law of cause and effect and prepar ations for the time when, as steps upon the path, they will be lived out in full, even as they are portrayed in the Gospel stories of the life of our Lord. There are, however, more than five stages on the pathway which leads out of the purely worldly life, with its material and rather self-centered motives for living. The change begins with a sense of frustration, and with a growing feeling of dissatisfaction with one's own limitations a:nd the hollowness of the purely material and worldly life. So many probl ems, interior and external, remain unsolved, so many questions remain unanswered, when guidance is sought from the formal religions of the day. The result of these experiences is a growing determination to conquer one's weaknesses, to develop one's powers swiftly, to find esoteric truth and to live a more spiritual kind of life. When this stage is entered upon external help begins to be received. Persistent effort attracts the attention of both the Adept head of the neophyte's ray1 and the great official whose assent must be gained before advance ment into pupilage of an Adept is sanctioned. This official is known as the Maha-Cho han, part of whose office is to keep the record (said to be imperishable and preserved in a Golden Book) of the progres s, the successes and the failures of every human Ego on this planet who, from the remotest times, has entered upon the path of swift unfoldment. Thus 1 Sec footnote I, p. 102."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"224 THE HID DE!'! WISDOM IN THE HOLY BIBLE Adept consideration is given to every aspirant and, in due course, recognition of evolutionary stature is granted. Sometime during this phase the outer man in his personal nature is guided to the dis­ covery of a satisfying system of philosophy. The outer circum­ stances of his life may even be molded to assist his evolutionary progress, so far as karma permits. The next phase consists of the discovery of a valid1 occult school, application for admittance, acceptance, and the receipt of the necessary guidance and training which will help in the passage through the later phases of the life of the path. These experiences are of the first impo rtance; for they mean that the ancient way has been found by another pilgrim on earth, sometimes for the first time and sometimes as a repetition from former lives. As a con­ sequence, a marked change of outlook upon life is likely to occur. This may be described as both the universalization of conscious­ ness and the di m i n u ti o n of the sense o f self-separateness and of se lf - i m port an ce . Realization of oneness with the larger Self of the universe and with the life of all nature is also deepened. This continues until the fifth of th e great initiations, when conscious \"oneness with the Father\" is obtained or \"the dewdrop (of individualized self-consciousne ss) slips into the shining sea\"2 (of the life of the universe as a whole ). The Firll lnifiaticm The first official step on the path follows in due course. It is known as \"probation\" and refers to the pre se ntati<m of the n e op hyte, generally during bodily sleep, to his Master-to-be. In full self-consciousness and with the higher senses alert, he finds himself in the presence of a perfected being, full of majesty and power, and yet also of kindli ness and friendliness. The significance of the experience is then explained by the Master. The inevitable tests and trials are described, and the candidate who accepts is taken as a pupil on probation. Sometimes needed cha ng e s in character are pointed out, special work indicated, and the so-called \"living ima g e \" is made and kept by the Master. This image is in some form of superphysical radio or radar con ta ct with the outer 1 Valid-accepted and used by !he planet's Hierarchy of Adeplll. 2 Th• Light of Aslo, Sir Edwin Arnold."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"STEPS ON THE PATHWAY 22S man, wherever he may be in the world. Somewhat as upon a tele­ vision screen, thoughts, experiences and actions are reflected in it hour by hour and day by day. The Master, who regularly examines the living image, is thus able to keep a watchful and kindly eye upon his new pupil. When the time is ripe, official \"acceptan ce\" as a disciple follows. The pupil's aura is intimately attuned to that of his Master, who absorbs him into himself for a time and charges him with his Adept power, life and light. Thereafter, wherever an accepted disciple may be in the outer world his Master can always use him as a channel of his power and his blessing and, on occasion, as a vehicle for his very presence. The next step is described as \"Sonship of the Master\", and after this inexpressible privilege has been granted an even closer attunement is established between both the auras and the i!lner Selves of disciple and Master.' When the necessary progress has been made the first great initiation follows, though on occasion this step may precede that of Sonship. In Buddhism the initiate of the first degree is called Sotapatti or Sohan - meaning \"he who has entered the S t r e a m .\" In Hinduism he is referred to as Parivr ajaka - meaning \"wanderer\". In recognition of the advance­ ment which has been achieved under the Master's guidance, a powerful initiatory ceremonial is performed, the \"path proper\" is entered upon, and admission to membership of the Great White Brother hood of the Adepts and initiates of this planet is granted. A powerful descent occurs of the Monad-Atma into the Ego, and later into the personality, and the star of initiation thereafter shines out in the upper part of the aura of the initiate. Increasi ngly close attunement with the Master and with the consciousness of the Great White Brotherhood itself is thereafter experienced, as also is a deepening sense of responsibility for the evolution of life and form upon this planet. After this great step the Ego of the initiate is said to have reached a degree of development which will insure his safe passage through the Day of Judgment, which will occur on this planet during the next, the Fifth, Round.2 Such, in t Although !he Ideas wbfch follow are to be found fn the Scrfp tureo of Hfndu!Jm and Buddhism more especially, indebtedness is here acknowled11ed to C.

The Second Initiation The second great initia tion follows, and during this phase three fetters must be outgr own and cast a sid e. They are doubt, superstition, and t he delusion of s e lf - se p a rat e d existence. A very rapid d e v e l opm e n t of the mental body usually occurs during this evolutionary phase and this can p r ov e to be a great test under which , it is said, many aspirants may fail. The mind, while a mighty instrument in th e hand s of the Ego, is also the vehicle of Ahamkara or s e lf-p e r son a lit y , with its concomitants of p ri d e and desire for power, position and prestige. These temptations assail e ve ryon e who steps out of the worldly into the sp i rit u al life and, in c ons e qu e nc e , acquires powers somewhat greater in certain direc­ tions than those of the man of the w o r ld . While the ordeals and t e sts are accentuated at certain phases, th e y are not restricted to those \"temptations in the wilderness\" which follow spiritual \"Baptism\". The occult life as a whole is a great ordeal, a great test, made up of many ordeals and many tests. All must success­ fully be passed through before the h igh e r initiations are granted. The second great initiation brings the aspirant to that phase which is known in Buddhism as Sakadagamin - \"the man who returns but once\" (before A r h a t s h i p ) . In Hinduism be is known as Kutichaka - \" th e man who builds a hut\" (has reached a state of peace). The p s ych i c faculti es g e n eral ly de v e l o p rapidly during this phase, which corr e spo n ds to the Baptism of the Lord Christ, since the particular difficulties through which the candidate must pass are portrayed in the tempta tion of Jesus in th e wilderness. The Third and Fourth Initiation. An initiate of the third degree is referred to in Buddhism as An agamin - \" H e who does not return\" (or t a k es the fourth initia ­ tion in the same l i f e ) . In Hinduism he is known as Hamsa or Soham - a mystical word m ea ning \"That am I\" or \" I am He\". This would seem to imply that self-id entity with the supreme Lord of Life has begun to be known; hence the power, in full conscious-"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"STEPS ON THE PATHWAY 227 ness and with truth, to make this great affirmat ion: \"I am H e \". The Transfiguration of Christ portrays this phase, and it is said that the manifestation of the inner Spirit through the outer form of the initiate of the third degree can be so powerful and so full that, on occasion, what would appear to be a physical transfigura­ tion takes place. The shining Au goeides, the immortal initiate Ego, f r e qu e ntly descends upon the outer man - indeed, the two arc now almost one- to bestow upon him transcendental powers and veritable genius. In this initiatory degree presentation before the One Initiator, the great Lord of the World, occurs and the initia­ tion itself is said to be conferred by one of the Lords of the Flame. When the initiate is out of the body at night Buddhic consciousness is available to him, while by day he is able to be fully aware in the higher mental w o rld s and to use the powers of Causal consciousness. The fourth gr e a t initiation g e n e rally follows the third in th e same life. In Buddhism the initiate of this degree is known as an Arhat - meaning literally \"one worthy of divine honors\". In Hinduism the Sanskrit title Par amahamsa, m ean in g \"above Hamsa\", is bestowed. This is the p h a s e of Crucifixion. The suffer­ ings of the Christ before Pilate and on Golgotha allegorically describe the interior experiences of the initiate of the fourth degree, for whom the axiom \"no cross, no crown\" becomes true. Ind ee d, if he seeks to th r o w down his cross it will crush him in its fall. An extremely interesting if somewhat terrible experience is associ­ ated with passage through the fourth initiation. The Arhat d e sc en ds into Hades o r Avi chi ( th e waveless) and attempts to rescue souls who are self-impri soned there. This is part of the meaning of the statement that Our Lord preached to the spirits in prison.1 The initiate now enjoys Budd hie consciousness while awake in the body, and when asleep can enter Nirvana, t hi s being part of th e meaning of Christ's Resurre ction. The Fifth and llighe r lnitiation8 The fifth great initiation is known in Buddhism as that of the As ekha -- \" n o more to learn\".
