Without an indication as to their place in the scheme of things the observations recorded will read like fantasy. They may still remain that to many sceptical minds. but the least that those of us can do who know these records to be genuine is to offer a rational explana- tion of the material presented which will be at least intelligible to a logical mind. if not entirely convincing. Science recognises in the varying rates of vibration of the ether the cause of all \" material.\"' both in the visible and invisible world of physical experience. Solids. liquids, and gases are the three familiar states of physical matter. Ether is postulated as the fourth. and through this as medium heat and light play-each with a known series of wavelengths. Electricity also has as its field this fourth region of physical matter, a region which, it is suspected, bas also its sub-divisions.

It has a large variety of phenomena associated with it. which have been to some extent measured and described in this same mystery teaching. Beyond the astral world there stretches yet another range of experience. the mental. and beyond that others of a still finer nature. responding to still more spiritual aspects of consciousness. All these rates of vibration interpenetrate each other. in the same way that solids. liquids and gases are all present in a sponge filled with water- the sponge being solid, the water liquid. and the gases themselves composing the water. So our physical world has. around and within it. astral and mental activities running close knit to its own. and intimately associated with its phenomena. The phenomena of \"life \"-such as cell growth. variations of structure. sports. etc.. the causes of which are so little known- are due to infiuences from the subtler worlds. as we shall presently see. No wonder, then. that they confound the student who is blind to all save physical rates of activity. It is possible to investigate these subtler rates, though, in order to do this. organs of perception must first be developed. The organs of perception of these finer levels of experience must each be tuned to respond to the order of material which they are meant to investi- gate. In practice. such mechanisms are only found in a specially disciplined body.

So occultism teaches that each human soul uses a physical body. including the finer levels of the physical ether. as well as solids. liquids and gases, and also an astral or emotional body and a mental vehicle. As the physical structure becomes more refined and delicately organised through the long processes of evolu- tion. these subtler bodies also become more highly developed. and begin to specialise organs of perception at their own levels. This is the basis of clairvoyance• as it is now familiarly called-an experience which ranges from a transitory \" vision \" in a moment of strain. through the experience of the partially developed organ. which can see occasionally but cannot direct its sight to any extent. to the point of full self-conscious control of the inner vision.

Common tradition has always recognised its existence, and, in every byway of the world where hearts are clean and minds are simple, stories of the \" little people \" abound. t Here we have before us a record of researches running over some years, which confirms that common tradition in many details. The mystery teaching again fills in the gaps and makes of broken fragments an intelligible theory. The deva: evolution is said to run in partnership with our humanity.

We can see this beginning to-day in the agricultural world. During the latter half of the evolutionary cycle, humanity, having come to an understanding of the natural principles of growth. conquers Nature by obey- ing her fundamental laws, and thereby wins the willing obedience of the lower orders of nature-spirits and the joyous co-operation of the higher ranks of invisible workers.

The occultist sees no \" dead matter \" anywhere -every stone thrills with life, every jewel has its attendant consciousness. however minute. The grass and trees are pulsing to the touch of tiny workers, whose magnetic bodies act as the matrix in which miracles of growth and colour become possible. As the following observations and remarks by Mr. Hodson bear directly on this point, they are inserted here rather than in the body of the book:- \" In the examination of bulbs growing in bowls. it is observed that large numbers of small sub- microscopic etheric creatures are moving about in and around the growing plants. They are visible etherically as points of light. playing around the stems and passing in and out of the growing plant. They have the power to rise into the air to a height equal to that of the plant, but I have not seen any rise further than that.

They have no consciousness apart from this. When the process of absorbing is taking place they become enlarged and appear like pale violet or lilac-coloured spheres, some two inches in diameter, with radii of force flowing from a central point within the sphere. The ends of these lines extend slightly beyond the circumference. Having expanded to the largest size which they are able to reach, they return close to the plant, enter it. and begin to discharge the material, or vital force, which they have absorbed. The natural etheric vital flow from the half-grown plants reaches quite two feet above them, and in it other tiny creatures play and dance. tossed up and down by the flowing force in which they rejoice. To etheric sight they are less than a quarter of an inch in size, though both varieties must be sub-microscopic from the point of view of solid measurement. In addition to this a process of absorption by the plants themselves is plainly visible, etheric matter flowing towards them from all sides. In some cases feebly waving tentacles are extended from the etheric double of the plant, and through them ctheric matter is being absorbed. These tentacles are hollow etheric tubes, slightly curved and slightly wider at the mouth, and are pale grey in colour. The longest I can see extends four to six inches from the plant and is from a quarter to half an inch in diameter.

The bulbs themselves give the impres- sion of great power and concentrated energy. They are quite like power-houses charged with great force. The colour is pinkish-violet. with an intenser light in the centre, and from this centre the flowing force previously described radiates vertically upwards, carrying with it at a much slower pace the moisture and other nutriment As a result of this and other attempts to under- stand the processes of growth I have come to the following conclusions:- In the heart of every seed is a living centre, which contains the stored-up results of previous seasons as a vibratory possibility. Apparently the awakening, or stirring of the life in due season produces sound. This sound is heard throughout the elemental regions where the builders answer the call to labour. Every type of growth, whether of stem, shoot, leaf or flower appears to have its own note, or call, to which the appropriate nature-spirit ' builder ' must respond. This sound also has a form-producing activity, and is, probably, the means by which the archetypal form is translated to the etheric level where it becomes the etheric mould. Some of the results of this vibration appear to be:- (1) To separate and insulate a portion of the atmosphere round the seed. (2) To call the builders, who. entering the· specialised sphere. are enabled to materialise on the sub-plane in which they have to work.

(4) Probably also to materialise the archetypal form into an etheric mould. New vibrations are introduced, as leaf. shoot, stem, and flower are to be built, so tlY..t the corresponding free matter is affected, and the corres- ponding builder is called and set to work on the appropriate matter. The vibration. or sound, appears to radiate, not only from the life centre, from which it first springs in due season. but also from every embyro ceU. The corresponding builder absorbs the appropriate matter. i.e., that which is responding to the same vibration as himself and the cell he is building, and transforms it by association with himself into a suitable condition; he changes it from free to specia- lised material and discharges it, atom by atom. to the cell from which the sound is being uttered, build· ing it into the etheric modeL The vibrating cell acts as a magnet and draws the newly mived material to its appropriate position, so that the cell is gradually enlarged until it reaches its limit of possible expansion; it then divides, and a new cell is gradually built up by a repetition of the process. While the material is in close association with the builder, it is not only specialised to suit the requirements of the celL but it is given the light vibration to which the builder naturally responds. i.e., it is coloured.

Leaf and stem seem to be the field of their labours. Each change in structure and colour calls for another set of builders. When the flower-stem and flower are to be built. a new set of builders arrives on the scene. Apparently these are more advanced, for. on their arrival, the whole process of growth is quickened and stimulated. They work in precisely the same way, and, as soon as coloration is to begin, the fairies proper appear and implant their special rate of vibration, changing the white and green into the particular colour corresponding to the note which called them and by which they work. These last are sufficiently advanced to be fully aware of their task and to find great pleasure in its joyous performance, and they take immense pride in the growing ' child • under their care. They remain in close attendance, as each new petal and bud opens. until the structure is complete and the task of the builders is finished.

The natural \" body \" used by elemental lives seems to be a pulsing globe of light. Streams of force radiating from this centre build up floating figures, \" wings '' of radiating energy, and filmy shapes of vaguely human likeness. In the more evolved forms the head and eyes are always clearly distinguishable, often the whole figure is there. with a \" centre \" of light blazing at the heart or head. A sylph of this type might materialise into a beautiful male or female form for work at the etheric level among plants, animals, or even human beings, but its natural body is at the astral level, iridescent, changing, pulsating with astral forces, but not limited to a fixed or definite shape. The account of plant growth just quoted introduces us to the humblest order of nature-spirits at work. The variety of forms in the deva kingdom is endless, but is roughly classified by tradition into four groups, according to the element in· which they work. Earth, water, air and fire spirits are called respectively gnomes, undines, sylphs and salamanders. The gnome does not always have to remain a gnome, however, but can progress in the course of the centuries towards ever higher forms: after caring for plants and trees he may ensoul the element of fire, and, later still, may become a great angel helper in the work of human evolution. The consciousness of deva beings is much freer than our human consciousness. Their mentality and sense of responsibility vary enormously according to their develop- ment. Tiny etheric creatures working in the grass run about aimlessly, just \" going somewhere \" like gnats in the sun. The busy travelling of these specks of etheric being has its function-that of keeping active"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"22 FAIRIES AT WORK AND AT PLAY the vital currents in the grass itself and so stimulating growth even in that low order of plant life-but these tiny entities have only a mass consciousness, if any. of the purpose for which they exist. So also the groups of workers, brownies, elves, and pixies, seem to work at their tasks like a hive of bees or a nest of ants, without individual responsibility, though instinctively in touch with Nature's plan. The gnome and the fairy are still without an individual mind, one, that is, which would be capable of selection and discrimination in the face of equally balanced opposites: their intelligence would be comparable to that of a pet dog or domestic animal, alert and observant. though not yet rational, and this would hold good of all orders up to the devas of high mental attainment. These workers with Nature differ from man, then, most fundamentally on this point-that humanity (however ignorant it may be of the fact) has as its centre of consciousness the mental faculty, whereas the nature- spirit has its ultimate centre of self-consciousness in the intuition. This shows itself throughout their activities in their almost unconscious sense of co-operation with others at their own level. in their willing obedience to those members of their own kingdom who are of higher rank than themselves and in their direct sense of Nature's plan for growth in all kingdoms. This direct touch with the plan consists not in an analytical knowledge, but in an unconscious recognition of its validity and a real delight in serving its purpose. The organisation for work is a voluntary hierarchical system. The whole scheme of activities is said by tradition to be divided into seven streams. At the head of each stream stands a great archangel, one of the \" seven spirits before the throne of God,\" and beneath"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"INTRODUCI'ION 23 him on a Jacob's ladder of development, no rung nussmg, stands the rank of angelic hosts, Nature's builders. The higher devas know the plan, and dis· seminate it by a kind of mental osmosis to all the ranks below them. Each group has its leader, responsible to one of a group above. It is of great interest to see traces of this hierarchical arrangement in the facts observed by Mr. Hodson. The work of some of the etheric forms has been described, and will be fully dealt with in the pages that follow. The higher fairies, sylphs, and salamanders have their centre of consciousness at the astral level, and dip down into the physical plane chiefly to stimulate the life of trees and larger plants. They may live as the cnsouling life of a tree or group of trees (like the \"dryads\" of tradition), the magnetism of their bodies stimulating the far slower activities of the tree, the circulation of sap, etc.: or they may be engaged in raying out strong influences over certain spots, termed \" magnetic centres,\" which have been put under their charge, or in assisting in the building, stabilising and distribution of thought· forms, such as those resulting from the use of religious and magical ceremonies, orchestral music, etc. The still more evolved devas or angels, who have reached the level of self-consciousness, become the guardians of special nations and groups, attached to work of special importance in tho scheme of evolution, either on the physical or other planes, and acting as angel messengers who carry out the will of the Most High in all the worlds. This study of the \"life side\" of growth may help us to a better understanding of that driving resisdess intelligence that wo vell under the mass-unity name of •• Nature.\""},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"24 FAIRIES AT WORK AND AT PLAY The agents distributing her abundant life thus become real and companionable, and, further, we may realise something of our human duty in partnership with them.

A medireval style of attire is invariably affected. A short brown coat, sometimes with a wide scalloped collar. bright buttons and facings of green, brown knee breeches. rough stockings, and two distinct kinds of boots: some- times a large heavy \" agricultural \" boot is worn; at others a long pointed shoe of lighter make. How variations occur will be seen from the description given later, of the manufacture of a pair of fairy shoes. A long pointed cap is the usual head dress, though a low-brimmed hard hat occasionally replaces the deer-skin nightcap-shape more generally worn. Groups of brownies, hard at work, have been noticed to be wearing aprons closely resembling those worn by blacksmiths; bright buckles and clasps are generally part of their equipment. Working brownies carry and pretend to use tools, chiefly spades and picks, with which they delve in the earth with great earnestness. Brownies vary in build: some tribes being short and squat, with fa~ round bodies and short limbs; others being slim and youthful in appearance. Their height varies from four inches to a foot. Usually the face is that of an old man, with grey eyebrows, moustache and 25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"26 FAIRIES AT WORK AND AT PLAY beard. red complexion. and a weather-beaten aspect. The eyes arc small and beady, and the expression simple. kindly and bucolic. By nature they are communicative and friendly creatures, living in tribes, and, like most of the fairy peoples, highly imitative in their habits, their attire, and their methods of work and play. They belong to the soil, and have much of the rustic simplicity of the tiller of the ground. Apparently the type is of medizval origin: at any rate, their present appearance is certainly moulded upon the countryman of that period. What function they perform in the processes of Nature is not clear: they are generally to be found on or just beneath the surface of the ground, and amongst the roots of trees and plants. I have seen them digging most solemnly amongst the roots of growing plants, yet such an expression of mock seriousness and make-believe pervades all their activities that it is never quite clear whether they regard their endeavours as work or play. The following accounts of several different occasions on which they have been observed may help us to an understanding of them. A BROWNIB VILLAGB In a thick wood consisting of oak and h:tuel, with SOTM beech. Lake District. June 28th, 1922. \" On the steep side of one of the crags on the western shores of Thirlmere is a very large colony of brownies: they live just below the ground level and spend their time as much beneath as above the surface. I see a number of tiny little houses, just beneath the surface of the hill. They arc quite perfect in shape, mostly wooden and thatched. and they have windows ancl"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"BROWNIES AND ELVES 27 doors. They are scattered irregularly about the hillside. In among them, and the roots and rocks which surround them, numbers of brownie figures are to be seen. The following is an attempt to describe one selected at random. Not more than six inches high, he looks like a little old man, wearing a brown hat shaped like a nightcap, and a brown suit, consisting of what appears to be the brownie regulation knickerbockers, stockings and boots. The face is grey-bearded, and bears the impress of an ancient rusticity. Undoubtedly there is the make· believe of domestic life, though I do not see any female figure in this fairy village. Brownies literally swarm over this hillside and vary very little in appearance, expression, or intelligence. They seem to be just • evolving ' here. They differ from any brownies I have previously seen in that they do not appear to work in connection with any processes of Nature; though they venerate the trees, they do not appear to serve them in any capacity. One of the more boyish nature-spirits which also ' live ' here bas now approached me, and, standing some two or three yards on my right, is proceeding to ' show off,' with extravagant gestures and simple-minded humour. He is much slimmer than the older-looking brownies, and bas a touch of colour about him-a little red on the hat (which is conical with the point banging back slightly) and a little green in his brown costume. I hardly think be can be a brownie; his feet run down to a point, his nether limbs are thin and elongated, and his bands are far too large for the rest of his body. He rests his left band on his hip, and points with his right band in the direction of the wood, as if proudly displaying the beauties of the place: added to his pride there is a sood"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"28 FAIRIES AT WORK AND AT PLAY deal of vainglory and childish self-satisfaction. His face is clean shaven and red, his eyes are small, his nose and chin are prominent, his mouth is very wide and still further expanded into a grin. His gestures and poses are amazing. His body is so supple that he can bend and stretch himself to almost any position. I cannot persuade him to approach any nearer, as he immediately begins to show apprehension. He appears to feel uncomfortable, though not, I think, really afraid. The human ' aura ' is inharmonious to him and he would probably lose his equilibrium within it. By contrast I realise how ethereal and fragile is his make-up, possess- ing less consistency than a puff of wind; yet the form is perfectly clearly outlined, and the details are sharply defined. Looking again at the brownie community and striving to grasp some of the details of their life, certain peculiar facts present themselves. For example, an endeavour to see the inside of their houses showed to my surprise that they had no inside-that when one went in at the door there was nothing there! The outside shape is fairly perfect and quite picturesque, but the inside is just darkness. In fact the illusion of a house entirely disappears when the consciousness is directed to the interior. Certain fine lines of flowing magnetism are all that one sees. The brownies enter by the. door and then put off the brownie form, and descend deeper into the earth in a relatively formless state. They all seem to have the conception of being busy, hurrying about the place in a pseudo-serious manner-but to me the whole thing is pure make-believe. There does not appear to be much communication between them, and they are all exceedingly aelf-centred. The houses do not belong to any individual or group"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"BROWNIES AND ELVES 29 -any member of the colony uses them, this • use' being limited merely to passing in and out through the door. They certainly get some satisfaction from con- templating the exterior of these houses. I do not see belonging to these woodland brownies, any of the working tools, satchels, or aprons which I have noticed on other occasions. They appear to be less intelligent and less highly evolved, more self-centred and far more aimless in their existence than any others I have met.\" A HOUSEHOLD BROWNIE Preston, January, 1922. \"For some weeks my wife and I have been aware of the presence of a nature-spirit of the brownie family inside the house. He was first observed in the kitchen on the shelf over the range, and later in the hall and the drawing-room. He differs somewhat in consciousness and appearance from the working brownies whom we have hitherto observed. This evening he entered the drawing-room, via the closed door, through which he has been seen to pass and repass. He began gambolling round the room, and the occasional flash of etheric light which accompanied his rapid movements attracted my attention. I gathered from him that these movements were expressive of his pleasure at my return after an absence of three days. He evidently regards himself as a member of the family, while there is also the suggestion that he ·has adopted us. This state of affairs gives him much happiness, and he contrives to give the impression of belonging to the place.

He has a bright. youthful clean-shaven countenance, with fresh colour, and dark brown eyes which are round and bright. The neck is a little too long and thin for our sense of proportion. He is clothed in a green, close-fitting coatee, knee-breeches, and brownish· grey stockings of a rough material; at the present moment he is wearing large boots somewhat out of proportion to the rest of his body. He is very lively, very familiar, and evidently has some regard for us, though normally we are not aware of his presence. I gather that the kitchen is his proper habitat, and that in some way the sight of household utensils pleases him. Again, unlike those of his kind that we have hitherto met, he does not belong to a band, and appears to have neither kith nor kin. On my saying this he looked up at me from the sitting posture which he assumed at the time I began to describe him, with an expression which plainly conveyed that as far as he was concerned we were his kith and kin. He finds his amusements and occupation in a manner all his own, and evidently possesses all he needs within himself. In his small way he has idealised the bouse, tho hearth, the household affairs, and appears to gain great satisfaction from his association with them. His intelligence is absurdly childlike; he has no reasoning faculty, and little of what we call the instinct in animals. He just plays and amuses himself with imaginary occu· pations, to pursue which he often retires into a comer and becomes oblivious of everything outside the thought world he creates for himself. To me this appears as a lavender-blue haze of glamour, surrounding him like a large cocoon; therein he plays much as a child plays with its bricks.

November, 1921. \" Among the little folks on this hillside the first observed was an elderly brownie. who. soon after we bad seated ourselves, stepped out to the edge of the little firwood behind us. He was some six or eight inches high and wore a long pointed cap, like a slightly imperfect cone. and a little green jerkin scalloped at the lower edge and falling about his hips; it was edged with brown, fastened with buttons, and had a broad cape-like collar. also scalloped and edged; little trousers completed his attire. At first he showed the lower limbs of an elf (i.e., long and pointed). He had a long. grey. scanty beard, and both his face and body were thinner and more austere than those of the usual brownie. He reminded me slightly of a caricature of Uncle Sam. clothed in the costume attributed to Falstaff. He took much interest in our dog and approached close to its nose. being absolutely fearless.

After strutting about for a time, as if to get used to them. he finally stalked off into the woods. \"• ELVES My experience of the elf is very limited, and I have only the two brief descriptions given below to offer as examples of a type which does not appear to be very common in those parts of the country I have visited for the purposes of investigation. Elves differ from other nature-spirits chiefly in that they do not appear to be clothed in any reproduction of human attire, and that their bodily constitution appears to consist of one solid mass of gelatinous substance, entirely without interior organisation. WOOD ELVES Under the old beeches in the wood at Coningly. August. 1921. \" Two tiny wood elves came racing over the ground past us as we sat on a fallen tree trunk.

In the future when the naturalist. ethnologist and explorer enter Fairyland. and its scientific text-books are studied in every school. new names will of necessity be given to all the many and various kinds of fairy people.

The complexion is very rough and coarse, the eyes are small and black, sloping slightly upwards at the sides. It has been said that the gnome form is a relic of the days of ancient Atlantis, and if this is true it may mean that the type is a representa- tion of the appearance of the peoples of those days, and though grotesque to us, is an expression of their standard of beauty. The true earth gnome is not a pleasant type of elemental; those met with in England have been either quite black or peat-brown in colour, and though I have never incurred their hostility their atmosphere is decidedly unpleasant. A TREE GNOME In the fields near Preston. September, 1921. \" Living in the lower portion of an ash tree is a gnome. He appears larger than any gnome I have ever seen, being, probably, two feet six inches high to the top of his cap. He assumes his gnome shape when preparing to leave the tree, which he does in order to make short excursions into the field. He moves across the field swiftly, at not less than twenty miles an hour, yet. in spite of his speed, he appears to pick his way fantastically over the grass, taking long strides and lifting his legs high into the air. He is in a happy mood, thinking of himself, his tree, and his excursions, while in the back- ground of his mind there are memories of play. mostly"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"36 FAIRIES AT WORK AND AT PLAY of a solitary nature, beneath the branches of the tree. These memories and their complementary anticipations increase his happiness. There does not appear to be the slightest room for anything but joy in his mind. His pleasures are in himself. He does not need the com· panionship of his kind in order to be happy. His happiness is therefore permanent and stable. He appears to live very largely in the present. Apparently he has lived for a very long period of time. the passage of which appears to make little or no impression upon him, either mentally or physically. An attempt to contact him whilst he is inside the tree produces a curious result in my consciousness: the trunk of the tree becomes transparent, with the gnome in the centre as in a glass case-with this difference, that the material of the surface is continued solidly through the tree; this etheric double of the tree is pale grey with a greenish tinge. The gnome seems to discard his traditional form when inside the tree. The trunk of the tree appears like a cylinder which, without the presence of the gnome. would be of one colour-that of the vital forces of the tree; the presence of the gnome gives individuality to these forces, as they are strongly affected by his rate of vibration. When the gnome desires to leave the tree. the first phenomenon that I can see is that he slowly assumes the gnome form, thereby encasing himself in denser matter. Having assumed his form he steps out on to the ground, and it is only then that I am really able to contact him as an individual. His features, especially the chin, are long and sharp, the cheek bones are high and prominent, the face thin and rather cadaverous, the eyes elongated like a Chinaman's, the pupils small and beady; the ears are large and protrude above his cap,"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"GNOMES 37 and his hair is dark in colour. There is a touch of red about the cap somewhere. but otherwise he is rather monochromatic. being of about the general colouring of the bark of a tree.

It is as though the etheric double of the tree were used to form his body. so that when he leaves the tree its etheric double stretches. This is his present condition. but there may be times when he is completely free. It is very curious to see him step into the tree. as one would step through a doorway. He appears always to come out of the tree at the same place and in the same direction. i.e.. on the south side.\" A RocK GNOME Lake District. June. 1922. \" Deep within the solid rock behind us there is an evolving consciousness. which manifests chiefly as form- less blotches of colour. a sort of embryo gnome; the beginnings of the head are visible in shadowy outline, together with the eyes and mouth. but the rest of the body is only faintly suggested, like the preliminary work of an artist. who might put in his main patches of colour and leave the clear outlines to a later stage. But for this vagueness the creature would be excessively ugly. not to say monstrous in appearance. To etheric sight the whole rock is transparent and the creature appears as if within a huge glass receptacle, through which it is only vaguely aware of its surroundings.

The feet that are to be are deep below the surface of the earth in which the rock is buried, and the head some three feet from the top of the rock.\" A DoMESTIC GNOME Lake District. June, 1922. \" While watching other nature-spirits my attention was attracted towards a large rock some forty yards away, beneath which is a gnome who lives under the ground. I caught a glimpse of him as he disappeared under the rock. He was a quaint dark grey figure, diminutively and grotesquely human, and was wearing a hat which rose to a point over his head and then fell over forwards. as if by the weight of a little tassel which hung from the point; the face was that of an old man, thin, cadaverous and lantern-jawed, with a long grey beard. He was clothed in a grey suit. with a coat reaching just below the waist. In his right hand he carried a little light, not unlike a candle, which shone with a yellow gleam. He descended into the earth. two or three feet below the stone, and moved about without obstruction.

He did not appear to work; he only made occasional journeys down to the water's edge. a distance of about forty yards. Now. as I watch for him. he has re-appeared with a different kind of head-dress. This time it is an elongated top hat. and. in general effect. he reminds me a little of the picture of the caterpillar which sat on the mushroom in Alice in Wonderland. He has the characteristic of curiosity highly developed. He would peep through windows and observe the habits of humans, and, though lacking the mentality to form any judgment from his observations, he would memorise and imitate many of the daily customs of those whom he watched. I see now why I got the idea, when I first saw him, that his cap was a nightcap and he was going to bed; evidently he was doing so for his own amusement, in imitation of human ways, regardless of the fact that he has no need to retire, to put on a nightcap or to take a light. and that he has no bed or bedroom, except the memory of one which lingers in his mind. His powers of concentration failed him as soon as he got below the earth, his manner and even his appearance changed and he reappeared at the surface with a new set of imaginations. This time he was going out-his ideas did not appear to extend beyond that fact-hence, I suppose. the top hat! Immediately after, a vacant look came over his face. his ideas came to an end, and even his form appeared to dissipate for the time being. A few minutes later he was seen moving swiftly down to the lakeside with a diminutive bucket, which he solemnly dipped in the water and bore, with immense satisfaction, back to his rock. Out he came again immediately. but this time without the bucket. and I"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"40 FAIRIES AT WORK AND AT PLAY saw the little form travelling swiftly, some two feet above the surface, out over the lake-where I lost him.

All he does is imitative of human beings. He certainly has a kind of affection for the rocks, grass and earth, which make up and surround his home.\" DANCING GNOMES In a field near Preston. September, 1922. \" There are some gnomes here which are at a lower stage of development than the tree-gnomes. They are smaller in size, being about four to six inches high. The gnome photographed a few years ago • probably belongs to this type. They differ from the tree gnome in that they are not solitary, but live and play in groups, their antics and games being weird and grotesque in the extreme. They are gaily coloured little fellows and use much stronger and brighter shades than do the fairies. The group which I am observing is dancing in a half circle; they are holding each other's hands and are swinging from side to side; their legs are not straightened and the knees point outwards. Their arms are too long and not perfectly straight at the elbow.

I see that it has the effect of disturbing and exciting the astral body, which is just a cloud of unorganised matter about twice the size of the physical. Undoubtedly they are also imposing a special kind of vibratory force upon it In repose, or semi-repose, the astral body is an almost shapeless cloud of matter; it is only slightly tinged with colour and has the effect of moonlight.

The face and hands are of the same dark colour. Their hats are long and pointed, with very narrow curled brims; they fit tightly on the head, the point slanting away behind. The features are strongly marked and prominent-the nose, in particular, being long and curved, and having at its extremity a kind of pro- tuberance, of an inch in length. The chin also is pro- minent and protruding, and the mouth is wide, and set in a perpetual grin. The skin is rough, and of a spongy texture. The eyes are black, beady and elongated. There is the appearance of a close-fitting garment, but it is of the same texture as the skin. This garment begins with a roll at the neck and finishes at the wrists and knees in the same way: calf, ankle, and foot are all in one piece, the foot coming to a point and being eight or nine inches long.

Mannikins are to be found in connection with trees. hedges, bracken, grass, heather and wild flowers. Those concerned with trees generally \" live \" in the trunk and branches, just inside the bark, through which they pass for purposes of recuperation and for work in connec- tion with the growth and colouring of the branches and leaves.

I have tried to communicate with individual members of the more pleasant sort. but their intelligence is very primitive-much below that of an animal-and I have not had much success. During instruction in the army we were frequently ordered to \" go through the motions \" of loading a rifle or machine gun for purposes of practice. The same phrase seems the best one to describe the \" speech \" of the mannikin, They \" go through the motions \" of speech; indeed, they sometimes appear to be shouting loudly and e:JJ;travagantly, but no sound that I have been able to catch issues from their widely-opened mouths. This is very typical of the lower orders of the nature-spirits who imitate many of the ways of Humanity without the slightest understanding of their meaning and purpose.

Certain races of mannikins have small oval wings. of a glistening semi-transparent substance.

Observations in different parts of England have led me to the conclusion that the mannikin is the most common fairy type in this country. although many variations are to be seen in different parts. An almost invariable experience has been that. while we were investigating other orders of nature-spirits, numbers of mannikins have approached us. They will stand or s1t at a distance varying from eight to twenty feet, in groups and pairs. gazing at us with undisguised curiosity. Examples of this type have been observed in Kensington Gardens. When they communicate with each other, I am con- scious of something closely resembling the twitter of the sparrows. and it has frequently been obvious that our personal characteristics have provided them with an absorbing subject for conversation. As a rule they are quite fearless, neither friendly nor unfriendly, drawing near us entirely from curiosity. TREE MANNIKINS A wood ncar Kendal.

A dark russet-brown coatee is worn, which hangs loosely over the hips, with a short nether garment. and grey. rough-looking stockings, which run off into a pointed foot. I do not think they wear boots. They are happy little fellows, and this is expressed in their faces. which wear a perpetual smile, as well as in their dark beady eyes. The eyeballs are glass-like and appear to be all black or dark brown: I do not see any white. They move slowly and, as far as I can see, without purpose; occasion· ally a little group combines in a sort of game. Four such just appeared on the pathway, joined hands and spun round clockwise. for about twenty seconds, then. still holding hands, they floated off further up the woods. Some of the tribe show an appearance of greater age and less activity than others. I saw one very old specimen seated at the foot of an ash tree. his thin legs stretched out in front of him; he really looked tired. His coat. which had a wide scalloped collar. was drawn in slightly at the waist by a belt that looked like brown leather. As I watched him he faded into the tree. and I was able to see the process of disintegration of the form. which appeared to hover in existence for a fraction of a second after its occupant had retreated. He did not dissipate it while still wearing it; he withdrew from it. passing out through the head.

While I was describing something else, my attention was attracted to his reappearance by a bright light which appeared at the foot of the tree, and, on being scrutinised, proved to be the same little man, now quite refreshed and most evidently wishing to draw our attention to the fact. He now dances extravagantly towards us, covering about half of the eighteen feet which separates us from the tree, and moving back again, holding his head on one side, and extending his legs gracefully as he moves. He is very proud of him- self. The whole fairy atmosphere of the wood is entrancing, and this little fellow beckons as he retreats inviting me to come with him into Fairyland.

Their faces are red, as if from exposure to the weather; the eyes are slanting and of non-human expression. One of them tries to converse with me; he points to the tree with great pride, as if to say, 'This is our work.' He walks with short steps, and sways, as he walks, from side to side, almost with a swagger. He is very amusing to watch. He shouts up into the tree for no purpose whatever, receiving no answer, so far as I can tell. He gesticulates, in his effort to communicate, and is evidently trying to tell me that all the outside portions of the tree are under the influence and care of himself and his fellows. Occasionally one of these flashes out from the tree, hovers in mid-air, then returns to the tree again. Perhaps they absorb vital essence from the air and give it to the tree? The autumn season, with the change of colour, seems to be an important one, for they are all intensely busy. The colour processes appear to engage most of their attention, though the method eludes me.

The eyes are long and narrow, the ears large, the nose curved and very sharp and thin; the lips also are very thin and slope upwards at the corners; the chin is prominent and pointed.

They are very timid and shy. and gather together at a distance when alarmed. The head is more rounded at the back, tapering towards the front. They are merry creatures and play games, as children do, some dancing in rings, some running along the grass together; an atmosphere of joyousness pervades their world. They must have some geometrical sense, for they form clear figures in their games; for example, I see a circle which has a Latin cross within it. They are conscious, I think, that in forming these symbols they are giving expression to some force which flows through them and produces an added sense of happiness and life.\" GREEN MANNIKINS Bowland Forest, Lancashire. April, 1922. \" The following description is of one of a race of mannikins dwelling at the higher levels of the moors in the forest of Bowland. The general appearance is that of a diminutive boy, six or eight inches high, with large head, rotund body, thin legs and pointed feet; a close-fitting, bright green, long-pointed cap is worn, with the point sticking out horizontally behind. Nothing else which could be called a garment is visible, though the body is covered with a tight-fitting green and brown sheath. The one under observation is quite a serious little fellow, standing in a small clump of heather near by."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"MANNIKINS 53 The face is round and chubby, mouth small, nose hardly perceptible, eyes round like saucers, with no eyebrows or lashes. The ears, if any, must be hidden by the cap, which, as I watch it, becomes ringed with circular bands of pink and blue. An etheric emanation is visible all round him, to a distance of about an inch and a half; it is blue-grey in colour and is of much smoother and finer vibration than that of the human kingdom. There is one vital centre, at a point corres- ponding to the solar plexus, from which these emana- tions proceed. A small chakram, • yellow in colour, is working at the top of the head. One might hazard the guess that the form is vivified through the solar plexus. while consciousness functions through the chakram in the head. From the centre of this head chakram a thin. threadlike connection rises into the air and passes beyond my vision. This little fellow has seated himself, with an air of patient good-will, and I now see that the ears are small. and pointed at the top; meanwhile his fellows are running, jumping, and flying about, some little distance away. I would not say for certain that they speak, but their interchange of thought, such as it is, seems to reach me in the form of a ceaseless chatter. They are full of life and happiness; and are completely oblivious of everything except themselves and their familiar natural surroundings.\" DANCING MANNIKIN In our Drawing-room, Preston.

He is in an abnormal condition, as though keyed up by surplus energy and extra vitality. His complexion is that of a healthy, outdoor child, his eyes dark brown, large and wondering; he walks with a slight swagger, the body swaying from side to side, his hands are on his hips when he is not gesticulating. He dances several steps, some of which are not unlike a Scotch reel, though he does not pirouette. Two other similar figures are in the room. They are not unlike wood-elves, but their ears are normal and their expression is less weird and more human. These figures are all of male appear- ance, like little boys of eight or nine. They slide up and down the architrave of the door, they walk on the edge of the back of the settee, they do gymnastics on the bars of the chairs and table. In all of them the colour green predominates, though brown is intermixed with it. They appear to be enjoying themselves hugely. Their natural element seems to be the grass of the fields. They are performing what looks like a test match of long jump on the sofa. This tribe is composed of larger numbers than the groups or parties of brownies. They can move through the air at will. They have small trans- parent. wings, almost oval in shape. Their antics have an air of unreality and make-believe.

One of the party now stands in the very centre of the room, gazing up at me. I catch glimpses of others on the picture rails and frames. The standing figure is trying to communicate, and does so by what looks like a tremendous effort of shouting: no sound whatever reaches me. They are not ungraceful figures, having their tunic drawn in at the waist and falling loosely over the hips. Their wings appear to be continually quivering. Their little caps are close fitting round the head, no hair is visible. They have no interior structure, their bodies being all of a piece.\" GRASS CREATURES AT HoME In a glade a few miles from Preston. September, 1921. \"Diminutive green elf-like forms, probably about an inch or two high, with wings of peculiar shape and irregular outline, are to be seen on the ground. Their faces are flesh-like and their whole bodies clothed in a tight-fitting garment of green. They walk about in the grass, and appear to be wholly absorbed in the task of exploring the fairy pathways of what, to them. is a mighty jungle. Their existence seems to be connected with grass. whose growth is in some way intimately associated with theirs. They move very slowly in and out among the stems; they can fly, although I only see them covering short distances at a time, in rather a clumsy fashion.

They look like tiny bubbles, perhaps a sixteenth of an incb in diameter. Ooser contact leads me to think that these elves are talking to themselves all the time, this talk consisting of a constant repetition. Their aura causes the etheric double of the grass to vibrate a little more quickly as they pass through iL\" MANNIKIN COMPARED wrm BROWNIE A.t Whitendale. April, 1922. \" Whilst this was being written a gruff and rather cross old brownie came out of a clump of rushes near by and passed down the hill towards the mannikins. He was much like the brownies previously described, with slight differences of colour and detail in his dress. He had rather an ugly rough face, stubbly grey beard, and unusually large hands. He was constantly repeating something to himself as he came, probably some decision recently reached, and in the process of being put into execution. The contrast in age of both type and individual is very noticeable when he approaches the little mannikins which are playing about here.

Though the personality of the brownie is stronger and more evolved, yet his chakram is not so vivid in its life, nor so responsive in its working, as that of the mannikin. The type is becoming very set from age. It is not easy to see, with the limitations of human outlook, how the brownie will progress on to the next stage in its evolution, as both form and consciousness appear so fixed in their present attributes as to preclude their developing any others.

She is definitely female in form and is always nude; she does not usually have wings, and only rarely wears any kind of adornment. Her form, whether diminutive or of human stature, is always entrancingly beautiful, and all her movements are perfect. The waterfall is her favourite haunt, and there she is to be seen disporting herself, generally with a group of her sisters, enjoying to the full the magnetic force of the fall. Apparently there are periods when the undine retires from the vivid external life in which she is most frequently observed and finds a measure of quiet and repose deep down in the still cool depths of the pools below the falls or in the quieter reaches of the rivers, as well as in lakes and ponds. This life below the waters is in strong and marked contrast to the amazing vivid· ness and joy she manifests amid falling water and sunlit spray. The three fundamental processes of Nature-absorp- tion. assimilation and discharge-are expressed fully in the outer life of the undine, indeed that life may be said to consist entirely of a continued repetition of those three processes.

At that magical moment of release she experiences an ecstasy and exaltation beyond anything possible to mere mortals dwelling in the prison of the flesh. The expression on the face and particularly in the eyes at that moment is beautiful, I would almost say wonderful, beyond description. The eyes flash with dazzling radiance, the face expresses rapturous joy and a sense of abnormal vitality and power; the whole bearing, the perfect form, and the brilliant splendour of the auric radiance, combine to produce a vision of enchanting loveliness. This condition is immediately followed by one of dreamy pleasure in which the consciousness is largely withdrawn from the physical plane and centred in emotion. The form becomes vague and indistinct for the time being, until, having assimilated the whole experience, she reappears and repeats the process. There are, doubtless, many other kinds of nature- spirits connected with water, and a description of one type, differing from the undine, is included in this chapter. UNDINES Whitendale. April, 1922. \" Seated in a heather-covered bower beside a water· fall which flows between two huge stones and falls a distance of five or six feet on to the moss-covered rocks below, an attempt is made to study water-fairies, which are not easy to contact immediately after the consciousness has been attuned to the land-fairies."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"60 FAIRIES AT WORK AND AT PLAY They are certainly more subtle and quicker in their movements. They also change their form with bewilder- ing rapidity. As I see them they are like diminutive human females, entirely nude, probably four to five inches tall; their long hair streams behind them and they wear some decoration, resembling a garland of small flowers, round their foreheads. They play in and out of the fall, flashing through it from different directions and calling all the time in wild tones that rise occasionally to what is almost a shriek. This calling is infinitely remote, and reaches me but faintly, like a shepherd's call across some Alpine valley. It is a vowel sound, but as yet I cannot name the series of vowels of which it is composed. They can travel up the fall against the stream or remain motionless within it, but they generally play and flash through it. When a cloud has passed away from the face of the sun and the fall again becomes brilliantly sunlit, they appear to experience an added joy; they then increase the activity of their movements and their singing. I can nearly represent the sound by the vowels e, o, u, a, i, in one word, which ends with a plaintive and appealing caden~ There are between eight and twelve of them playing at the fall; some are rather larger than others, the tallest being about eight inches high. One of the tall ones has just increased her size to probably two feet; and now she flashes off, higher up the stream, with great speed. Some of them have rosy-coloured auras and some pale green, and the closer contact, which I am now obtaining with them, shows me what extremely beautiful creatures they are, and at the same time how utterly remote from the human family. They pass in and out of the great rocks at the side of the fall without experiencing"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"UNDINES AND SEA SPIRITS 61 any obstruction whatever. I am quite unable to attract their attention or to influence them in any way. Some of them pass under the water in the basin at the foot of the fall, and occasionally appear amidst the swirling froth. The garland, referred to previously, is luminous, and apparently forms part of their aura.\" UNDINES Thirlmere. By the side of Dab Ghyll. November, 1921. \" There are two different grades of water-spirits at this fall. One is apparently connected with the whole ghyll, and was first seen travelling swiftly up the mountain on which the stream rises. It is definitely of the undine variety, but rather larger than those previously seen, though similar to them in other characteristics. The figure, which shines as if wet. is female, nude and without wings, the exquisite limbs gleam through the white auric flow, the arms are particularly long and beautiful, and she waves them gracefully in her flight. She is about four feet in height and her general colouring is silvery white, with gold stars round the head. She moves up the fall by a series of darting motions of exceeding swiftness. disappears from view as if into the rock, reappears, and flashes down again. As I watch her rapid movements she appears suddenly to become languid; her form slowly dissipates and her consciousness sinks into the ground, as if to rest.

She has reappeared, and obviously experiences con- siderable joy, taking great interest and delight in the large fall, over which she hovers in a fashion that suggests some emotion akin to brooding tenderness. She shows a certain natural seriousness; in her there is none of that careless inconsequence which marks so many of the lesser nature-spirits. In her mind there is a sense of responsibility for certain aspects and processes of evolu- tion which are taking place here, connected chiefly with the water and the vegetation. Over the rock under which she retired there is a decided magnetic influence, due no doubt to her long-continued presence there, which has given the place a strongly defined aura and influence of its own. There are some less evolved undines at the actual falls, where they appear to be permanently stationed. They, too, can pass in and out of the rock at will. They differ from the one described chiefly in size; they are less than a foot high, and appear to be making vocal sounds. Their joy is more unrestrained and their whole bearing more irresponsible than hers. They are five or six in number. Their slim, graceful, nude bodies are supple in the extreme, and they constantly assume poses of great beauty as they float in the midst of the fall, or hover just in the edge of the spray. A charac- teristic attitude is one with the body upright and more or less stiff, limbs straight, arms close to the side, head thrown slightly back, eyes looking upward. In this pose they ride slowly upwards through the falls to the top, like a bubble rising through water; having reached the summit they flash free into the air, releasing the concentrated energy which they appear to have absorbed, making a"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"UNDINES AND SEA SPIRITS 63 brilliant display of colour and light. radiating joy and delight in all directions. They are singing in a high-pitched but full-toned voice, which reaches me as a series of broad vowel- sounds, generally on the ascending scale, and ending on a note almost incredibly high. Just now the sun is full on the falls, and they are making the most of the magnetic vitality which results. This vitality they draw within themselves, until they are charged almost to bursting point. They use quite a strong effort to compress and contain this vital energy, until at last it becomes too much for them and bursts forth in the manner described, impinging visibly on the surrounding rocks, bracken and trees. This process fills the undines with an intense joy; they thrill inwardly during the process of absorption and compression, and at the time of discharge a delirious pleasure is felt. One might almost say that they lose their heads; their actual form becomes indefinite for a moment or two, during which they appear as flashing radiant light. It was. in fact. these flashes of intense brightness which first attracted my attention and led me to try to study them. Undoubtedly, all this means growth for them and for the scenery amongst which they live. I think the smaller ones are in some measure under the control of the larger nature-spirit first described; certainly she hovered. watching them, during the visit she paid up the stream. when I first saw her.\" THE SPIRIT OP mE FALL Lake District.

She differs in some characteristics from undines previously observed; she is very much larger than those we have seen before, has a more highly developed intelligence, and is winged. She seems to ensoul the rocks, trees, ferns and mosses, as well as the actual water- fall itself. When first seen, she sprang out of the solid rock-a marvellously beautiful figure-hung poised for a moment in the air and then disappeared. She repeated this process several times, but whether she is visible or not, her presence can always be most distinctly felL Her form is a beautiful, pale, rose pink, and suggests a marble statue come to life. The hair is fair and shining, the brow broad, the features beautifully modelled, the eyes large and luminous, and, while their expression has something of the spirit of the wilds, their glance is not unkindly. The wings, which appear to rise from the shoulder blades, are small in proportion to the body, and would surely be inadequate for flight if such had been their purpose; they, too, are of a rosy pink. Even more striking than the form is the rainbow- like aureole which surrounds her, as a halo surrounds the moon. This aura is almost spherical in shape, and consists of evenly arranged, concentric bands of soft yet glorious hues. The colours are too numerous, and in far too rapid movement, for me to detail them, but her aura would seem to contain all the colours of the spectrum in their palest shades, with perhaps rose, green and blue predominating. Some of the bands of colour are outlined with a golden fire and beyond the outer edge a shimmering radiance of pearly white gives an added beauty.

Although they usually remain over the water they make occasional flights to the fields. They resemble large white birds. flying at great speed. and, at this distance. I cannot make out any distinct shape; they take and lose many different forms. with great rapidity: there is a general sugges- tion of wing-like formation and occasionally the like- ness of a human face and head.

Their movement is not unlike that of swallows Hying over the surface of a river. They do not appear to enter the water, though they occasionally alight on the shore, shooting up again with a brilliant flash of light. Their colourin~ is chiefly white, deepening to dove-grey. They are non-individualised expressions of group con- sciousness. As I watch, numbers of them have been drawn together into one form (I use the word ' form ' for want of a better term. but the form referred to is the merest film). an envelope of large size, in which they are enclosed as are birds in an aviary. The actual geographical position of this envelope is some distance down the lake. over which it floats like an indefinite balloon of enormous but varying dimensions. In its centre there are a number of very bright points of golden light. which appear as if suspended at different levels. These nature-spirits as they enter the envelope appear to lose their outline, and all that remains is a sense of movement inside it. Next moment they are all let forth again like a flock of doves, to resume their rapid Hight up and down the lake.\" SEA SPIRITS N.W. Coast. January, 1923. Far out at sea are huge, sea-green etheric monsters, fish-like. and yet unlike any fish. Their forms are"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"UNDINES AND SEA SPIRITS 67 transparent like glass-shining with a weird green light of their own. They appear to carry themselves upright, and, though they have a head and body, I cannot dis- cern in these creatures any resemblance to the human shape. From the shoulders downwards no limbs appear, the denser form runs almost to a point. and then spreads out into the finer matter of the aura. They seem to rise slowly up from the depths of the sea. sometimes completely out of the water. sometimes only partially so. Other more airy forms, of a human shape, scud about over the surface of the sea. Amongst them are smaller sea-fairies, riding on the waves and rejoicing in the electric vitality borne in with the incoming tide. By contrast the huge deep-sea creatures are exceedingly slow and heavy of movement, they gaze vacantly around them, their intelligence being very limited and obtuse. There is almost a quality of fierceness in the exultation and joy of the sea creatures, as if they took on something of the power of the sea itself. They are much more active and virile than land-fairies. The smaller ones appear completely concentrated in their own activities. Far in the distance a group of great sea-devas is visible. The head of each is crowned. They are huge, solemn. majestic rulers of the sea, faintly reminiscent in appearance of the god Neptune. In the ocean shallows there are sea-nymphs, in shape just like a human woman and of radiant beauty. They are not winged like the land-fairies. They live in colonies both under and on the surface of the sea which is their home. Riding on its waves and sometimes sinking into its depths, they pass a joyous existence.

These, as well as the smaller sea-fairies, are much more keenly alive, much more strenuous in their existence than their land brethren. Far down, in the ultimate depths of the sea, I see huge, filamentoid, vegetable-like, etheric forms, with little or no external consciousness, drifting about with the currents. I can trace the gradual development of form, from the shadowy film-like creature with conscious- ness wholly inturned, up to the magnificently organised form of the sea-nymph and sea-fairy rejoicing in amongst the breakers. These last are definite and permanently embodied entities. They leap into vision and out again, with the speed of light, and one gets the impression of colour, a hint of form, and they are gone to reappear elsewhere. The chief difference between the hosts of nature- spirits to be seen over and in the sea appears to be that of size. The majority are human in shape, though there are others more nearly resembling fishes: of the human-shaped varieties, while all are a-sexual, the general appearance is female. A prominent charac- teristic also is the rapidity with which they take and lose their forms; they constantly change into brilliant and relatively formless flashes of light, and back again into· the human form, which appears to be their natural one. The general rule seems to be that the larger varieties are further out at sea, while the small ones play in and out amongst the breakers. An average size, at a distance of 200 yards out, is a little below the human. One of the larger variety recently came within a few"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"UNDINES AND SEA SPIRITS 69 yards of us. and I observed that several others flashed short distances inland and back again. The one which came near to us was almost dead white in colour, its body glistening all over as if wet; it was entirely nude. and its form was curiously unstable, so that the difference between the (relatively) dense form and its auric emana- tions was frequently lost. Many of them appear to pass their whole time i:a flashing swiftly over the surface of the sea, now diving, feet foremost, wholly or partially into the water, now shooting, with the swiftness of light, high into the air. They are in a state of exultant joy, bathing themselves in the powerful magnetism of the sea. They absorb some of this magnetic force into themselves and, after a pause. in which some form of assimilation takes place, they discharge it. Their existence is vivid in the extreme, far beyond anything possible to us who live in the dense physical form-even at our periods of highest exaltation. Further observation appears to support the idea that they continually absorb and discharge force in some form or other. At last I have caught a glimpse of a sea-fairy when, for a fraction of a second, it was relatively motionless; this is a very rare occurrence! It appeared fully charged with vital force, which radiated to a distance considerably beyond that of its normal emanation, say six feet in all directions, giving it the appearance of a glorified and radiantly happy human being. with blazing eyes, standing with arms outstretched in a shimmerin8 aureole of white light. The creature was obviously rejoicing with extreme delight in the sensation of being supercharged with vitality; when this was discharged, and the sensation past, it proceeded to repeat the process."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"70 FAIRIES AT WORK AND AT PLAY The smaller varieties of sea-fairies bear some resem· blance to the land-fairies that have been photographed,• except that they have no wings and are nude. There also appears to be more variation in size, as the sea creatures in the breakers vary from nine inches to two feet approximately. Contact with them gives rise to quite different feelings. The land-fairy is wholly pleasant and friendly. and its vibrations are har- monious to the human; the sea-fairies, on the con· tracy. are not as yet within easy reach of consciousness. so far as I am concerned, and their rate of vibration does not readily harmonise with mine. They are also much more self-centred, not appearing to hold much, if any, communication among themselves. There is a good deal of calling, but nothing in the nature of response; indeed, their state of constant and intense activity would appear to render them unreceptive to external communication. (This statement must be taken very generally. as it is obvious that there is some form of group consciousness and communication amongst them.) The smaller varieties do not rise so high in the air as their larger brethren, but they make graceful flights, rarely rising more than thirty or forty feet, more frequently skimming over the surface or riding on the crest of the waves. Those further out at sea rise to great heights. in fact beyond my range of vision. WATCHING THB INCOMING TmB April, 1922.

As previously stated, it appears that as the electric vitality of the flowing tide increases, the hosts of sea- spirits clothe themselves in etheric matter in order to participate more vividly in the marvellously refreshing and vitalising magnetism which is created and released as the tide rises higher and higher. When this condi- tion is changed to the comparative quietness of low water, they retire to the astral plane, where they dwell upon the stimulating joys through which they have passed, and await eagerly the turn of the tide, when they can once more repeat these vivid experiences, of which, for them, life seems so largely to consisL It is possible to reproduce within oneself a little of their thrilling ecstasy, by watching them and endeavouring to unite one's consciousness with theirs. This process of self-exaltation, which they continually repeat, appears to begin some d:stance out at sea, whence they rush, with inconceivable rapidity, towards the breaker line where they enter the tidal magnetism, which is dis- charged upwards and forwards during the whole period of flow, increasing in intensity and power as high-water mark is reached. Entering the magnetic field they become visible in human shape, frequently catching the physical eye with brilliant flashes of white light; then they move forward slowly, absorbing the magnetism and experienc- ing a sensation of extreme delight, until they reach a"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"72 FAIRIES AT WORK AND AT PLAY stage where even their ethereal organism can contain no more: there is a moment's pause, the face assumes an expression of the most radiant joy and vivid vitality and the whole being is surrounded by an aureole of light, something like an electric discharge; as satura- tion point is reached the whole force is dissipated; the creature then fades out of etheric vision in a state of dreamy inaction. and retires once more to the astral plane. During this process the astral body swells to quite twice its normal size (about double that of the dense body); it is enormously quickened by the experience, the effect of which seems to last some considerable time. The force absorbed and discharged becomes impressed with the vibrations of the sea-spirit, which has specialised it. in a similar manner to that in which prana is absorbed and specialised by man. Another variety of sea-spirit is one resembling a huge seagull with a human head, the long white streaming wings being formed by the auric configuration; they are not set quite in the same way as those of the bird, they rather suggest two curved spokes of a wheel and remind me of that familiar agricultural implement, the chaff-cutter. with its big wheel and curved blades. These sea-spirits appear to move not by the ordinary progression of flight, but by turning themselves over and over, wheeling and whirling swiftly through the air, forty or fifty feet above the breakers. Apparently they flash about continuously. without pause, rejoicing, but in a less concentrated and systematic way than those previously described. An average size is about twice that of the large seagull. They look very much like flying white wheels revolving in swift motion through the air. As I have been describing this, seated on the pier some"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"UNDINES AND SEA SPIRITS 73 thirty or forty feet above the waves, several of the white sea-spirits of human shape have observed us; some of them pulled up suddenly, pausing for a second and look- ing, with a somewhat startled air, in our direction, as if surprised at seeing a human being attempting to penetrate their kingdom. Their faces are singularly beautiful, and quite human in appearance; even the eyes have not that non-human expression which is so characteristic of all types of nature-devas. It is difficult to say just where the difference between us lies. With us intensity of emotion seems to suggest heat or, at any rate, warmth of feeling; with the sea-spirits I feel an intense coldness, like a vibra- tion from another world, a world physically cold, yet emotionally alive. They remind me of the moon, for, deep within, in spite of all their rapidity of movement and intensity of feeling, there is a cold impassiveness, as if there were no heart beating in this almost mechanical representation of one of Nature's forces.

She is decidedly fair in colouring. full of laughter and happiness. very open and fearless in expression. and is surrounded by an aura of golden radiance in which the outline of her wings can be traced.

Stretching out her arms to their full length, she performs an act of concentration which has the effect of reducing the size of her aura and of turning its energies inwards upon herself. Having maintained this condition for about fifteen seconds she releases the whole of the concentrated energy. which pours forth in all directions in streams of golden force. and appears to affect every single stem and flower within its reach. (She is in the centre of a clump of chrysanthemums.) She thus reinforces the vibration which is already there, probably as a result of previous similar activities on her part. Another effect of this operation has been to cause the astral double of the whole clump to shine with an added radiance. an effect which is noticeable right down to the roots.

They are dancing and playing on the hillside, which they people in countless numbers. Appearing amongst them occasionally is a creature partly resembling a gnome, but with an animal's hind legs. These little folks have no wings, and lack the vivid vitality which has characterised all the other types of fairies we have met. Their consciousness is only operating very partially through the forms~ some of them seem almost to be walking in their sleep. They are extremely gentle and courteous in their relationship with each other, and express love rather than joy. Theirs is a very peaceful, quiet, dreamlike existence. The centre of vitality appears to be just within the small of the back, the astral body being connected to the physical at that point and floating immediately behind and above it. It is shapeless, and the predominating colours are silver and rose, brilliantly illuminated. The creature appears to be less than half incarnated. Probably the race is so ancient that it is about to die out. FAIRIES Kendal, December, 1922. A very lovely variety of fairy lives here.

A beautiful female nature-spirit, exactly like a small tree-deva, has a residence in a thick hedge near by where the growth of brambles, creepers and bright red hawthorn berries is profuse. Evidently processes similar to those in trees take place in big hedges. This nature-spirit is of a particularly engaging character. She is perhaps three or four feet high. lightly robed in a flowing transparent filmy garment, and looks straight at us, with the frankest and friendliest of smiles; she is remarkably vital and gives the impression of great dynamic energy held in perfect control.

As an experiment I yielded voluntarily to the powerful glamour of her presence, and for a time, unconscious of the body yet always sufficiently awake in it to return at will, experienced some measure of the joyful and radiant happiness which seems to be the permanent condition of all the dwellers in the fairy world. There is danger in too close a contact; it requires a decided effort to withdraw and take up the burden of fleshly existence once again. (September 26th, 1921. In a glade a few miles from home. Beautiful old trees, touched with autumn tints, a stream gently flowing, and the whole bathed in autumn sunshine.) The surface of this field is densely populated by fairies, brownies, elves and a species of grass creature, something between an elf and a brownie, but smaller, and apparently less evolved than either. The fairies are flitting through the air in short flights, taking very graceful poses as they fly. They express in the highest degree the qualities of light-heartedness, gaiety and joie de vivre. A number of them are flying about singly. They flit from place to place, pausing a moment between each flight. They seem to be bearing something which they give to the grass or the flowers at each stopping place, at least they put out their band and touch the place where they come to rest, as if applying some substance, then they move swiftly away again."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"FAIRIES 79 They become more clearly visible as they alight and as they move away; one loses them after have landed.

It is due to the arrival of a group of fairies. They are under the control of a superior fairy who is very autocratic and definite in her orders, holding unquestioned command. They spread themselves out into a gradually widening circle around her and, as they do so, a soft glow shines over the grass. Since two minutes ago, when they swung high over the tree tops and down into the field, the circle has spread to approxi- mately twelve feet in width and is wonderfully radiant with light. Each member of this fairy band is connected to the directing fairy, who is in the centre and slightly above them, by a stream of light. These streams are of different shades of yellow deepening to orange, they meet in the centre merging in her aura, and there is a constant flow backwards and forwards along them. The form produced by this is something like an inverted fruit dish with the central fairy as the stem, and the lines of light, which flow in a graceful even curve, forming the sides of the bowl. Their continued activities were producing an ever- increasing complexity of form, when time, unhappily, forced us to depart."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"80 FAIRIES AT WORK AND AT PLAY Lake District. August, 1922. A group of fairies are gambolling and dancing on a little plateau on the other side of the stream. Their bodies are female, their main clothing is pale blue; their wings, which are almost oval in shape, are constantly fluttering as they dance in a ring hand in hand. Some of them wear a loose girdle, from which is suspended an instrument like a hom. All are draped with a material which serves to conceal the form more completely than is usual with this type of nature-spirit. Their height is probably six inches. Their hair, which in all cases is brown, varies from very light to quite dark shades. The colouring of the fairy form is a very pale rose pink, beyond which, in nearly all cases, is a pale blue aura and pale blue wings. They are performing something not unlike a country dance; and I think it must be their thought that produces numbers of tiny daisy-like flowers, which appear and disappear-coming sometimes as single flowers and some- times as wreaths or chains. They are discharging into the surrounding atmosphere a good deal of specialised energy, in the form of silver sparks, and the effect produced by this miniature electrical display, flowing through their auras and through the curious misty glamour, or haze, in which the whole group is bathed, is most beautiful; it extends to a height of probably eight or ten inches over their heads, and reaches its highest point over the centre of the group. The effect of it upon the fairies is to give them the sense of complete seclusion: in fact, the nature-spirits of other species which are in the neighbourhood do not enter within the charmed sphere.

By this I mean that, just as on the human line of evo!ution the life works up through the mineral, vegetable, and animal stages. and then moves on into the human kingdom and becomes an individual human being, so the stream of nature-spirit life evolves likewise through the mineral and vegetable and on to the animal world, where it is associated with the smaller birds, fishes and insects. The lesser fairies, etc., that we have described are about at the level of our domestic animals; and the life finally passes through these forms to that of the sylph, after which stage it is able to act as an individualised \"angel.\" In this book. however, I have given the name of sylph only to those nature-spirits which appear to be connected with wind, cloud, and storm.

Pale rose and pale azure blue predominate, while the radiance of many hues plays continually about their heads. A group of three. which I am watching, presents a most spectacular appearance. As they wheel and fly across the wide arch of the heavens, the bright colourings flash forth with extreme rapidity, between them and about them in all directions, but more especially up into the air. Occasionally, what appears like a variegated sheet of colour, arranged in shining bands, streams from one to the other. and shades off into the palest tints imaginable, which, as far as I can see them, are chiefly pale blue, rose, green, and lavender, while through them scintillates a brilliance like yellow tongues of flame. There is a definite order in this colour communication. though the meaning of it is completely hidden from me: the chief notes seem to be fierce exultation and joy. The faces of these creatures of the air are like strangely beautiful but fierce human females, strong, vital, and controlled in spite of their apparent reckless abandon. They appear to travel, with the speed of light, great distances, of ten to fifteen miles, in a moment of time. They are entirely astral in substance. On the slopes of Helvellyn. April, 1922.

They bring a condition of high excitement with them. and give the impression that they are working up the electric and magnetic conditions which characterise a storm. Their faces are human and well formed, their expression is unpleasant; the rest of the body is not fully formed, and they rather resemble birds with human faces. They travel with far greater speed than would be possible for any bird, crossing the valley in a second of time.

Thousands of beings, of whom this is but a halting description, revel in the midst of the storm. The clash of the mighty forces gives them an exaltation of consciousness (a word expressing the opposite extreme from \" exaltation \" would be more accurate, for the effect is to furnish those dark legions of the storm with conditions in which they can come forth into outward manifestation, by providing them with vehicles). They wheel, swoop, dart, soar and hover, apparently intensifying the forces of the storm, which in them seems to find embodiment. ~ehind these and above them in the very heart of the storm is one beside whom the elementals of storm and disintegration are but flickering bats.

It was the knowledge of this \" Presence \" in the midst which inspired courage and calmness when, just before a flash of lightning cleaved the heavens with a ribbon of fire. one of the dark beings seemed to swoop down, and for a moment hover close above us.

In- stantly the dark storm-fiend sped away, uttering the weird, exulting, unearthly cry which was continually audible, as if from a thousand throats, throughout the storm. In the midst of all this uproar there was calm, poise unshakable, a power which even these unruly legions acknowledged. Beyond a certain limit they could not go, for they were ever held in check by a Will which reigned supreme over the elemental forces as, like Hell let loose, they fought out the battle of the storm, hour after hour, through the night.

The colours of the aura appeared to emerge from this centre and to flow in continuous waves outwards to the edge. Highly complex forms were produced by its rotatory motion and the emerging lines of force and colour. All these lines were curved, and continually recrossed each other like basket-work, and the whole centre was spinning with great rapidity and shining intensely. The main colouring of the aura was gold and rose; with this was mixed an unusual shade of blue, which, combined with the other two colours, caused a purple hue, like that of heather in sunlight, to flow continually through the aura. In addition to this, lines of force streamed away from the body, dividing at the shoulders in a wing-like formation which extended above the head. Contact with the consciousness of this glorious being gave a sense of exaltation, radiance, and intense activity. The play of its consciousness affected the aura over its head, causing sets of colours, differing from those described, to appear and disappear, keeping pace with the activities of the mind. It stretched its bands towards us, sending a stream of energy into us. causing our auras to vibrate with a little of its own force. Raising its hands and arms vertically upwards, it seemed to appeal to us to leave the limitations of the flesh and rise with it to higher levels of space and consciousness.

In this book I have confined myself to those particular classes which are especially associated with Nature and. which I have had the opportunity of studying. This chapter deals chiefly with the nature-devas concerned with the vegetable kingdom who, in most cases, are seen in the open country. away from human habitations. To them physical bodily life has not the importance which we attach to it. They are accustomed to the destruction of form and would not discriminate between a wrecked human body and a lightning-riven tree. They represent what might be termed Nature's point of view, and see in the destruction of form nothing more tlian a change-a natural process. It is impossible for this particular type of nature spirit to understand our human sentiments and valuations of form, while to human beings their utterly logical attitude appears as implacable ruthlessness. Another marked difference is shown by their disregard of detail, while human life is practically made up of details. The nature-deva deals in broad outlines, vast landscapes, and huge elemental forces. and never appears to consider a part as separate from the whole.

I am impressed by the fact that the whole of this district is densely populated with deva life at all levels from that of the tiny nature-spirit, brownie, mannikin, gnome, and fairy, up to the individualised orders of nature-devas. Broadly speaking, the lower types remain near the surface of the earth; there is a clan of fairies apparently approaching individualisation and possessing both intelligence and will-power, which rises to con- siderable heights; the upper air and mountain summits are occupied by the various nature-devas; it would appear that these last rarely descend to the bottom of the valley, and much more frequently rise to great heights in the air. The first glimpse I get is that of swiftly moving forms on the surface of the mountain and in the air. Some- times it is possible to follow a single form for long dis- tances; at other times the attention is attracted by a vivid flash with a sense of movement in a definite direc- tion only. It is something like the traffic of a populous city, with the buildings and noise eliminated. No matter where I look, or to what distance, I am aware of this phenomenon. A WHITE NATURE·DEVA Lake District. June, 1922.

At first glance they appear to be clothed in flowing white robes. almost Grecian in style, which are in constant movement. as if blown by a high wind. The actual form is distinctly human. and in its appearance the female predominates. The features are rounded and soft, and the eyes are more kindly and less piercing in this particular type than is usual. The aura is of subtler matter than the robes. and is marvellously beautiful. The colours, which are extremely delicate, are apparently arranged concentrically~ beginning from the outer edge the colours. so far as I can see them. are white. lavender, yellow, pink, and pale pink, with a slightly denser white aureole sur· rounding the actual form. All the colours are in most ethereal shades of delicate loveliness. The concentric arrangement is frequently changed, or covered by other colours which flash forth with the changes in consciousness. From the top of the shoulders and head, starting from the periphery of the body, the aura streams upwards to a distance of three of four feet in fine radiating lines of force; this gives an extraordinarily vital and definitely non-human appearance; sparks and flashes of golden fire play around the head. When the attention of this being is definitely attracted. the eyes light up with extraordinary brilliance and concentrated intelligence. In other portions of the aura there are similar, but smaller, radiations of force, and in the case observed these are very noticeable round the feet, which are perfectly formed. uncovered and human in aspect~ the total height of the body is from five to six feet. and the aura extends to about double the height and width of she central figure.

There is a centre at the throat, which is not so active. These, together with a very large chakram at the solar plexus, appear to be all the centres of vitality in this being. A circular motion is apparent at this distance (300 to 400 feet) at the solar plexus, and the movement can be seen to be clockwise; it is an extremely active vortex, whose purpose seems to be entirely that of absorption, and, as I concentrate upon it, I am able to see right inside it and even to feel the condition at this vital centre; it reminds me at once of an electric power house. At first it appeared to me as a cup-like depression with the entrance in front; a momentary contact with it must have raised my consciousness to a higher dimension, for, although still retaining its cup-like shape, it was open in all directions. This centre appears to absorb vitality, while the others appear to discharge it and to afford the means of self-expression. LAKE DBVA On the western shorej of Thirlmere. June, I922.

The whole aura streamed upwards from behind the body, which was poised in a semi-horizontal position as if upborne on a powerful wind from below. He made sudden movements, darting off to some 200 or 300 yards away, and then remaining poised as before, still gazing intently into the lake upon which his whole consciousness seemed to be centred. He appeared to be connected with the evolution taking place beneath the surface, and there were lines of force flowing from his eyes and hands down into the waters of the lake. His attention was that of one who scans some minute detail with great concentration, so that nothing escapes his gaze, and for the last half-hour, since he was first observed, his concentration does not seem to have wavered for the fraction of a second. I get the impression that he serves a superior who is always present to his consciousness. NATURB-DBVAS In the Lake District. Mythburn, November 26th, 1921. Facing Helvellyn.

In some the rich browns predominate, in others the green, in some the golden yellow, with the other shades showing as subordinate hues.

As I first saw it. it remained poised for a moment facing in our direction, with feet together and arms outstretched. its auric robe appearing quite solid within the clearly defined inverted triangle formed by the fingertips and feet. Now it is forming itself into another symbol by raising its arms in graceful curves and joining the finger tips over the head; an inverted triangle with a circle resting on its upturned base is clearly seen, because the triangular auric condition is maintained by the will. although the position of the arms is changed. The face looking out through the circle adds to the force of this symbol. In the midst of the aura the denser lines of the body give a clear representation of the Egyptian Tau. The arms are now drawn together and extended horizontally from the body, the head being bowed between the arms. There must be some auric extension of the arms because, viewed from the side, an equi· lateral triangle standing on its point is formed. Thia pose has had the effect of concentrating the aura. which now appears to be much more dense. and the red colouring now predominates. These movements are extremely graceful and seem intended to convey"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"DEVAS 97 some meaning connected with the manifestation of the forces of Nature. Other symbols are following, but my vision has become less clear, probably owing to a break· down in concentration. The figure now appears to be whirling rapidly in that manner known to boys as the cartwheel: it thus forms a perfect circle, and during the movement the limbs show constantly as fixed radii. (At this point I was unable to maintain my observation any longer.) A CRIMSON NATURE-DEVA AT CLOSE QUARTERS Lake District. June, 1922. After a scramble of several hundred feet up a rocky glen we turned out to one side, on to the open fell where it faces a huge crag. Immediately on reaching the open we became aware, with startling suddenness. of the presence of a great nature-deva. who appeared to be partly within the hillside. My first impression was of a huge, brilliant crimson. bat-like thing, which fixed a pair of burning eyes upon me. The form was not concentrated into the true human shape. but was somehow spread out hke a bat with a human face and eyes. and with wings out- stretched over the mountainside. As soon as it felt itself to be observed it flashed into its proper shape. as if to confront us, fixed its piercing eyes upon us. and then sank into the hillside and disappeared. When first seen its aura must have covered several hundred feet of space, but in a later appearance, in which it again showed itself, the actual form was probably ten to twelve feet high. The auric flow was exceedingly beautiful and swept back behind th~ body in wing-like sheets, extending from the top of the head down to the 0"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"98 FAIRIES AT WORK AND AT PLAY feet. and reaching backwards and outwards in graceful curves and flowing lines. The colours were darker than any of those I have yet seen in this type of being-a rich dark blue was the background of the auric colourings- with lighter blue, gold, pink, and leaf green also showing. In some parts the colours appeared almost like a peacock's feathers, in fact the aura was not unlike a glorified pea· cock's tail in effect There was a virility and force and an air of definite masculinity about this being. A continuous flow of the auric emanations caused ripples and waves to chase one another through the aura, suggesting coloured draperies in a very high wind. The central form and the central portion of the aura were of a rich crimson, the body actually glowing with this colour. He appeared to be \"in charge \" of that part of the landscape-to have undertaken its evolution, as it were-and his powerful vibrations were distinctly to be felt and must have a quickening effect upon the animal, vegetable, mineral and fairy life within his sphere of influence. This is the clearest vision I have ever had, and coming, as it did, quite unexpectedly, it carried with it powerful conviction to me. My physical body thrilled for hours afterwards with the force of the contact and the rapport established between us. TllEE-DEVAS Thirlmere. February, 1922.

There is nothing of the placidity of the oak, or of the slight restless awareness of the beech, but there is here an intensity of life, as though the ensouling consciousness had absorbed something of the fierceness of the elements, which this noble and ancient group has so long withstood. This intensity of consciousness is considerably increased by the presence of a number of very active nature- spirits who appear to find in \" The City \" a responsive field for their labours; they are moving swiftly in and out among the trees, continuously impressing their vibrations upon them. So great is the power with which they express this vibration that it produces the psychic effect of a sound like the running of a well- tuned motor engine. Some of these nature-spirits appear to have associated themselves closely with an individual tree or a lesser group of trees, and to remain stationary with their charge or charges included within their auras. Others move about, at the height of the topmost branches of the trees, and though they occasionally rise further into the air they do not appear to descend to the ground. I am again impressed with the virile intensity and ceaseless activity which characterise their work. They have succeeded in establishing a powerful keynote for the auric vibration of the whole group of trees, and it would seem that their continued presence is necessary if the quickening energising force thus induced is to be main- tained. On the physical plane it manifests itself as a powerful magnetic influence, so marked as to be noticeable without the aid of clairvoyance.

I am not able to see the forms below the level of the waist. In each the head and shoulders are distinctly human in appearance. but below that the form becomes indefinite. and so many streams of force play through it in different directions that it appears to shade off into auric activity; their auras contain numerous eddies and vortices. but the main streams of force suggest wing-like formations. The centre of life appears to be in the middle of the head. where there is a clearly defined chakram. The eyes are preternaturally bright. looking more like centres of force than organs of vision; they do not appear to be capable of seeing to any distance. and I question whether they are used for the recognition of any objects other than those with which they are immediately concerned. (The consciousness is seated at a higher level. and awareness is obtained by an inner sense rather than by \" sight.'') These particular nature-spirits do not seem to possess a high order of intelligence; although animated by a single purpose and having powers of concentration beyond those of the average human being. they are childlike and simple. possessing little or no mentality. Preston. 1921. As we walk along a field path a tall tree-deva has flashed into view some fifty yards ahead of us at a place opposite an old willow tree to which it appears to belong; the deva is silver in colour. and as tall as a human being.

With her rose-coloured lips and cheeks, and her very human smile, she has the ability to make herself appear like a flesh- clothed human woman. The effort to contact her consciousness more closely threatens to bring me under that glamour which observers of Fairyland have so often recorded. She seems to be conscious in all that portion of the tree which is above ground, her aura being larger than and including that of the tree, which she does not appear to have the desire to leave although she may have the ability to do so. I think she knows of the existence of the human family as neighbours, and regards the average passer-by with a certain good-natured indifference. There are many lower orders of nature-spirits connected with the tree, busily carrying out their various functions. While she is not the director of their efforts she is aware of them, and may occasionally control their activities. Epping Forest. July, 1923. This part of the forest is thickly populated with an exceptionally beautiful order of tree-spirits, differing in many respects from those we have met hitherto. One striking difference is that there appears to exist between them something like a communal feeling, in contrast to the aloofness and reserve of many other tree-devas.

Most of these tree-spirits wear the appearance of young girls. and are of human height. They have long dark hair. which hangs loose and gives them a rather wild look. Some are wearing garlands and loosely- hanging necklaces of leaves. The arms are bare and the shape from the waist downwards is not always clearly defined; one sees a downward flow of auric force. ethereal yet fairly stable. its colour like that of the tree trunks. I notice that when they move about among the trees. the lower limbs are clearly formed and gleam flesh-coloured through the auric garment; when floating they are folded together. and when on the ground are used normally. for walking. dancing. or posing. Their movements are most graceful as they glide and float among the trees. They are joyous. care- free. and communicative embodiments of the spirit of the forest. A similar species remains in the higher branches. and of these only the head and shoulders are clearly formed; the rest of the body is continued in a sweeping auric robe. which gradually becomes so ethereal as to be merged in the surrounding atmosphere. Their heads are on a level with the tree-tops and their auras envelop the whole tree. The larger trees seem to have one each. In some cases their auras are extended to include the smaller trees. and where there is a closely grouped ring. two nature-spirits appear to have charge of the whole of it. Closer scrutiny shows me that there are two different orders of tree-spirit. those described last being of a"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"DBVAS 103 higher order, and possessing a much greater degree of consciousness. Their eyes are particularly brilliant and are set at an angle in the face. They are impassive. and possess a degree of poise to which their younger brethren have not yet attained. About the head their auric display is very radiant and contrasts with their rather sombre forest robes. Yellow, crimson and violet surround their heads in semi-circular concentric bands. which scintillate and flash into the upper air-again showing in marked contrast to the immobility of the denser form. On contacting one of them more closely I have become conscious of extreme age and unwearying patience. In their eyes is an inscrutable knowledge. a calm certainty. the reflection of a consciousness which. having seen the passage of earthly seasons without number, is content to remain. in order that the purposes of Nature may be fulfilled. Passing beyond the eyes into their consciousness one touches a vivid intensity which I can find no words to describe. To pass into theirs from our human brain consciousness might be compared to stepping out of water into fire. They seem utterly untouched and unaffected by the passage of time. as if our seasons were but days to them.

Their move· ments have none of the swift darting motion which one notices in so many nature-spirits. They move slowly, sinuously and gracefully, whether they are walking or floating. There is here also a kind of faun, in height about two feet, somewhat like the traditional satyr, but without its ugliness. The upper part of the body is that of a young boy of about twelve or fourteen, while the lower resembles that of a deer. They have very prominent strongly marked features and a mischievous expression. The hair is curly. They prance around the tree-spirits. mimicking them, sometimes joining the group, but more usually merely playing about in a rather irresponsible way among the trees. These phenomena appear to be bathed in a violet- grey light, an atmosphere which emanates from the earth and extends to a height of about eight or ten feet Lancashire. February, 1922. The wood is composed of Scotch firs, birch, beech and ash, and is partially surrounded by a straggling and somewhat unkempt hawthorn hedge. It is the home of a small colony of very beautiful nature-spirits, apparently about twelve in number. They are of human height and form, but of no sex differentiation. Their main colouring is a bright apple-green, beginning at the shoulders with a very pale shade and deepening into a garment of dazzling beauty which streams far below their feet, like a long, diaphanous and iridescent train. The whole form shines with a similar brilliance of surface to that of a new green leaf.

This colony is at present extremely active, gliding and flash- ing up and down the wood, reminding one slightly of the appearance of bright fishes in a very clear stream, which occasionally turn on their sides and reflect gleams of light The whole glade thrills with the pre- sence of these beautiful beings: they remain about forty feet from the ground. and fly. with swift undulations, from end to end of the wood, and are impressing it with a definite rate of vibration. a strong magnetic impulse, by their long-continued and repeated activity. They are working to establish these vibrations permanently, and their efforts cause constant ripples and waves of brilliant rose, yellow. silver. and pale grass-green within the aura of the wood. They appear to have insulated the grove. placing it in a magnetic seclusion maintained by an etheric wall which they have built round it Two of them have observed us and paused in their rapid flight: they have focused their attention upon us and I feel the magnetic thrill which results from the impact of their consciousness. They are communicating with a helper who stands behind us. and who first directed our attention to the work~ his poise and general air of quietness and stability is in strong contrast to the activity of these highly electric creatures. At this moment a third nature-spirit has paused on the edge of the wood. about thirty yards away, and is regarding us with a radiant. dazzling smile. The auric flow in all these creatures is downwards and outw.::rds from the shoulders: this is what gives the appearance of streaming train-like garments of glistening green.

DBVA OP PINB FOREST In a wood neQI' Celigny, Geneva. Friday, June IJth, 1924. Whilst I have been watching the fairies and gnomes. with which this place abounds, a deva connected with the forest has appeared on the opposite edge of the clearing. He is specially connected with the fir trees. amid which he stands. It is interesting to note that while I am studying him a group of sylphs have passed over the top of the trees. He looked up at them and across at us as if to ask whether we saw them. He is very much at home among the trees and has a proprie- tary air with regard to them, and in his clothing-or rather in that part of his aura which resembles clothing -there are fringes and formations like the hanging needles of the fir trees. Over his head is a very bright band of brilliant colours. and these, combined with the fringes. produce the appearance of an American Indian. with head-feathers and fringed clothing. • I feel •It seems reasonable to assume that the dyed bead-featben of the Indians are <:Opied from these aums of nature-spirits wbic:h they 1'CSemble."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"DEVAS 107 assured that he has been here since remote times, when the place was wild and uninhabited; also that he has seen the passing of many races of men.

He is showing me a little of his method of work. He has the faculty of expanding his aura to a very great extent. so that he can include within it numbers of the trees. He places himself near them. draws into himself. by a process rather like deep breathing, a special quantity of natural energy, concentrating his aura round the group of trees upon which he wishes to work, and then releases his force with a highly stimulating effect: this quickens the activity of the nature-spirits, and stimulates and arouses the developing consciousness evolving through the trees.• When he is moving through space he arranges his auric forces so that they stream behind him, presumably in order that they should offer a minimum of resistance to his movement As he comes to rest, his aura gradually adjusts itself to the normal, and one receives distinctly the impression of large wings. He does not use these auric wings for flight, their appearance being produced by the way in which he arranges the currents of force which play through his aura.

He called her from the wood, holding out his left hand, and she floated gracefully towards him and grasped the out· stretched hand with evident joy, but also with a kind of submission. Undoubtedly there is a measure of affection between them, suggesting the human relation- ship of parent and child, but containing also something of comradeship. She is connected with one of the trees, some part of its psychic constitution entering into her, and the connection between it and her is maintained during the time of separation; on being released by the deva she at once slipped back into the aura of magnetic seclusion which the tree provides. I gather that she is a tree-spirit. There is some peculiar kind of gnome here, which floats about with its long shapeless legs trailing in the grasses; it is of a dark brown colour with a homogeneous body of spongy texture. Its arms end in a kind of clenched fist and its feet in points. The face is dark and swarthy, and its whole vibration rather weird and un- earthly. A sensitive person approaching this place at night would feel this vibration. There is also, at the root of the trees, an interesting variety of wood-elves, a group of which are regarding us with frank curiosity about twenty yards on our left. They have large heads and large pointed ears which stick out at the sides of the head. Their bodies are too small for the size of their heads, and their expression displays a mentality very low down in the scale. They scamper and play about amongst the dead leaves, occa- sionally joining in a curious dance-like movement, in which they will form a ring and, with joined hands. encircle a tree or a group of trees.

At Nateby, Lancashire. September 1st, 1922. This is a small oblong wood of well-grown ash and elm, about half an acre in extent. It differs from those hitherto studied by reason of the fact that it is inhabited by only one nature-spirit, whose working methods are also unusual. This is a deva of considerable development which performs its function upon the wood from a position in space some fifty to 100 yards above the tree tops. Though asexual, the form is predominatingly masculine. The chief colourings are bright carmine and gold; the face is singularly beautiful, the eyes brilliant and dark; the shape of the body below the shoulders is lost in the strong downward flow of the aura, which envelops the whole wood, enclosing it in an auric insulation. Within this there appears to be an upward flow into the centre of the deva's aura; psychically the whole looks solid, the space within the auric envelope being completely filled with fine flowing forces. The deva remains relatively motionless and, judging by the expression of its eyes, is extremely alert and observant. Occasionally it directs the flowing forces by movements of its arms, the whole presenting one of the most beautiful and extraordinary sights I have seen. The aura proper of the deva spreads out in a wonder· ful ovoid of brilliant hues, those mentioned predominat- ing, for some hundreds of feet above the ground: it radiates and scintillates like the aurora borealis, while the lower portion, which enfolds the wood, sweeps down in graceful curves and is coloured carmine, with fine"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"110 FAIRIES AT WORK AND AT PLAY sprays of golden sparks following the downward sweep. The dimensions may be of interest: from the grolllld to the highest point of the aura is about 150 feet, and the envelope of the wood eighty yards by thirty yards, approximately. NATIONAL DEVAS A MANX NATIONAL DEVA The Isle of Man. Lake District. August, 1922. I became conscious of the presence, at no great dis- tance, of a god of majestic appearance and mighty power. He stands somewhere on the hill-top. with head slightly bowed, looking down upon the island over which be presumably presides. On his kingly bead rests a five-pointed crown. consisting of a thick band with five points arising from it at intervals round the bead, one appearing over each temple. In his right band he bears a staff or thyrsus; his figure is gigantic and herculean. suggesting tremendous, almost resistless. strength. The general appearance is dark to me, but this may be caused either by my inability to see him clearly, or by distance. He stands motionless, as if watching and waiting, in a state of mental alertness. and his consciousness is obviously concentrated at levels above and beyond that of the traditional form which I glimpse. Undoubtedly there is a magnetic, not to say spiritual, connection between this country and Ireland, and the figure described appears to represent the spiritual forces of that ancient land-to be an out- post of the spiritual consciousness of Ireland. He appears to be a high deva, with special powers over the clements (a sort of Manx Jupiter Pluvius et Torums). I"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"DEVAS 111 should place him as a presiding genius, a national deva, an ancient ruler of this land. Yet in some ways he seems to be connected more with the island itself, and all its varied natural conditions and non-human inhabitants, than with its people, though these also are within the grasp of his consciousness. In some fashion, hard to express, I am conscious of the existence of a still more mighty being in Ireland, the head of a hierarchy of spiritual intelligences to which the being described belongs. That he has his agents among the lesser order of nature-spirits is apparent, and I should place the devas seen on the summit of Snaefell in that category. An attempt to contact his consciousness produces not, as I expected, a greater realisation of his nature, but visions of the past history of this island, which form part of his memory. I see a tall. powerful, viking-like race of men on the hillsides, making their way from their ships which lie on the north-east shores, towards Snaefell, as if sum- moned to a gathering. They are fair and powerfully built. Their clothing is of skins, their hair is long and their speech guttural and harsh. Another group of dark swarthy men approach from the south-west and south of the island, and it is obvious from this plane of con- sciousness, that there has been much bloody warfare between them in the remote past. The island in those days was larger than it is now and was occupied by at least two different races or types. and its connection, both spiritual and material, with Ireland was much closer than with England. • • Tradition tells of a reigning deity called Manaan, a divine king, under whom were non-human servants, known as ... hosts,\" whose appearance corresponds in some particulars to that of the Deva described on the summit of Snaefell."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"112 FAIRIES AT WORK AND AT PLAY THE Goo OF HELVELL YN June, 1922. There is a mighty Being whose abode is the mountain Helvellyn. He appears to me as a seated figure of human shape and enormous proportions. In endeavour· ing to study him, I find myself without any canons whereby his stature and his life may be apprehended. He appears motionless, and yet suggests great activity. He is quiescent, and yet obviously the unquestioned ruler of the life side of the mountain's existence. At the level of consciousness at which I am able to per· ceive him, the limitations of geographical space have no power, so that while from one point of view his form appears to be within the mountain's mighty mass, yet from another his head appears to reach up to the clouds. His immediate auric emanations are like no others I have seen; they consist of a large number of pointed tongues of flame, which radiate from him in all directions. reaching to great distances. Though these distances are beyond my conception of actual measurement. I should guess that they reach to at least 400 or 500 yards in all directions from his form, which is situated somewhere near the centre and summit of the Helvellyn group; beyond these striations his aura extends practically over the whole mountain, whose girth is said to be forty miles. Such an extension can hardly be correctly described as an aura; it is rather the sphere of influence within which he can act instantly. He appears as if seated in profound meditation, motionless and expressionless save that the eyes are ablaze with power-the power of a highly unfolded and awakened consciousness. Even at this distance (of"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"DEVAS 1.13 three miles) they produce a decided effect upon my consciousness. They glow like twin lakes of fire. His consciousness is seated in the eternal, and appears as deep-rooted and unshakable as the very mass of the mountain on which he resides. He remains motionless, firm as the mountain itself. From him great spiritual forces are flowing, radiating through his aura and out into space. He is surrounded by lesser devas and nature-spirits, aerial beings, whose movements give one the impression that they are in some cases messengers and in others servants, though I see no sign either of the receipt or despatch of a message or an order from the motionless God round whom this wondrous play of devic life is centred.

Its appearance and expression constantly vary in response to the activities of a sort of automatic mentality which was impressed upon it by its creator. When first seen, it appeared with a very large head and face and a very small body and limbs; it wears a pointed cap and its face is intensely ugly and inhuman in expression. aoser inspection shows that it has a very red face. and a large mouth, in which there are a few decayed teeth. set permanently in an ugly and malicious grin. The form is bent and aged, and it appears to totter with weakness when manifesting in its present etheric form, in which it attains the extreme of density and outward manifestation possible for it. The decaying vegetation, garbage. and driftwood of the brook offer it conditions in which it is able to prolong its existence. Before noticing it I had been watching the gambols of some little elves under a tree. and the contrast between their natural beauty and purity and the malicious ugliness of the elementary was very marked. Leaning on its staff it staggers over the grass toward the elves, who stop their games and gather together in groups as it approaches. Its attitude towards them is obviously hostile.

During the celebration of Mass I became aware that nature-spirits of many kinds approached and hovered in a great radiant cloud in the air immediately within reach of the vibrations of the ceremony. The smaller creatures-fairies, tree spirits and some manikins-bathed in the atmosphere of power with continuous and graceful motion. The higher and more evolved members of our hidden congregation remained relatively motionless, watch- ing, and absorbing the force poured out, and adding enormously to the purity and beauty of the service. From the very beginning to the final blessing they shared the ceremony with us, and at its conclusion slowly melted away as they returned to their homes-in the trees, the cornfields, hedges and ftowers,-taking with them, each according to his capacity, something of the blessing we had received. In addition to these fairy people who came to church with us there were also present those orders of ceremonial angels who are definitely connected with the Mass. • A DRUID CIRCLE August, 1922.

The incidents described below appeared to be so vividly impressed upon the place that I decided to try to describe those which seemed to be within the reach of my vision, instead of studying the normal fairy life of the district.) \" This is a complete Druid circle. consisting of single stones. varying in height from one foot to six feet. and surrounded on every side. except on the east. by mountains. Standing out vividly. against the background of many strange scenes which pass before the inner eye. is the impression made upon the place by the powerful per- sonality of one man. A mighty figure. priest. teacher and healer of his people. he stands out. like one of those rugged heroes of antiquity one reads of in the stories of ancient days. He is above the average in stature. dignified and impressive. with long dark hair and beard. which. later. became pure white; he is robed in a single white gar- ment. reaching to his feet. not unlike the surplice of to-day.

The high priest. who is evidently a master magician. raises both hands to the heavens above him. lifts up his eyes and utters a loud call. Hovering in the air are a number of devas of various grades. and. at his call. six or seven of the largest of them form a circle over his head some 80 or 100 feet in the air; their hands meet in the C~\"tr'!"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"120 FAIRIES AT WORK AND AT PLAY bearing fire. which is materialised so as to be visible to physical sight. A noticeable feature about these larger devas is that each one is wearing a crown. consisting of a narrow fillet of gold, encircling the head, in which are set dazzlingly bright jewels; at various positions round the head this fillet widens to upward points, a group of larger points resting over the forehead. The fire descends upon the altar stone in front of the high priest. and burns brightly without visible susten- ance. The other priests then form into two ranks and march forward to the altar stone, chanting a low and rather guttural hymn. On the descent of the fire the people form themselves into columns facing the three entrances at the north, south and west. and then march forward till they almost meet in the centre of the circle. leaving a fairly large square unoccupied. The people and the priests, with the exception of the high priest. then make obeisance to the fire; they stretch their arms forward and bow their heads, remaining in this position while the high priest utters a long prayer. A very powerful magnetic insulation existed, and still exists to some extent, round the circle, giving quite as much seclusion. from the occult point of view. as would a complete and solid temple. As the people stand with their heads bowed the devas descend quite close to them and a force. not unlike lightning in appearance, plays along their backs in the form of a huge cross. Lesser nature-spirits occupy the spaces in between the arms of this cross. some of them, as workers, holding the force along the lines of the cross, others apparently quite as much part of the congregation as the human beings. The priest evidently is conscious of the exist· ence of some mighty spiritual entity, to whom he is"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"NATURE-SPIRITS 121 praying and from whom the response apparently comes. This may be a nirmanakaya* or a lofty deva. and the reservoir from which the power flows. and over which the being apparently has charge. appears to be situated high up in the heavens vertically over the temple. The effect of the prayer is remarkable; the very heavens appear to open. and an enormous downrush of force pours into the central square formed by the people on three sides and the altar stones on the fourth. The people again stand erect. and the devas become intensely active. their chief concern being to see that the maximum of this force reaches the people. with a minimum of overflow and waste. The down-flow con- tinues for some time. forming a veritable pillar of living power. whose appearance I am at a loss to describe. as any words of mine would inevitably fail. The nearest description I can give is to liken it to liquid. fiery mother-of-pearl. opalescent and tinged with an inner colouring of rose. It penetrates downwards far into the ground and reaches upwards out of sight into the heavens. The high priest plainly sees it. as do some of the priests; the people feel its presence. but few appear to see anything. All adopt a highly reverent attitude of mind and body. and realise the sacred nature of the occasion. At a given signal from the high priest a number of sick and old people are carried into the spaces between the arms of the cross formed by the congregation; they are then led or carried into the square. where those who cannot stand are laid upon the grass. just outside the pillar of force. The weather is cold. and some of the • Adepts, \"Lords of Compassion,\" who sacrifice their beatitude (Nirvana) in order to help humanity.

The position they now occupy, however, greatly im- proves their condition. I see one man, of old and decrepit appearance, who was laid at the northern side of the square, raising himself on his right elbow, and extending his left band towards the pillar, like one warming himself at a fire. A glow of beat and magnetic energy passes through his frame, his eyes light up, and after a few moments he rises to his knees, where be reinains, still a t0ttering figure, but marvellously improved in both mind and body. He holds out the palms of his hands like a cup, into which one of the priests pours a little pale yellow liquid, which the old man drinks. Many others, men, women and children, receive such liquid. In cases of wounds the high priest heals them instantaneously by merely passing his hands over them. A tremendous power is flowing through him, his body appearing to be illuminated throughout with golden light; be evidently knows much of the inner powers of man, and his touch bas a magical effect upon his patients. This portion of the ceremony lasts probably from twenty minutes to half an hour, after which the whole attention is focussed on the high priest, who, standing on a flat stone, delivers an exhor- tation. I cannot grasp a word of his utterance, but the main idea appears to be an appeal for the humanities and an endeavour to assist the people to realise their unity and interdependence. There are some rough, wild spirits amongst them who, although tamed for the time being by his power and that of the ceremony, are by no means so gentle and submissive in the fastnesses from which they have come.

At the third, while the gathering remained with heads bowed, the high priest again looked up to Heaven and spoke; the downflow of power ceased quite suddenly, and the pillar disappeared. The people then turned about and, chanting with the priest, walked out of the circle by the entrances which had admitted them. They broke formation outside the circle and waited. The high priest then turned towards the serpent symbol and the priests who were facing him. He spoke to them and blessed them, swiftly making with his hand certain symbols in the air, which seemed to be of a circular or spiral nature, and which remained visible as they passed from his hand into the auras of the priests. He then extended his arms before him, partly open, as if to embrace the company of priests. They bowed their heads and a stream of power flowed from him to them and to the banner; this was maintained for an appreci- able time, maybe ten seconds, during which the priests were lifted into a state of great exaltation; the banner was then rolled up, and the priests passed out of the inner circle, talking to those whom they knew, and, in some cases, moving off with them, as they gradwilly dispersed. The high priest, however, and some of the others, together with a few of the congregation who were apparently attached to his person, proceeded down the slope to the east, where there was a group of stone dwellings at the foot of the hill. Each person appeared ·to have a small cell of his own, in which was a rough bed of earth and peat The windows were openings in thJ wall and the whole place decidedly primitive, though not uncomfortable. The high priest, immediately on entering his compartment, seated himself on a bench, and became entranced; he seemed to remain in this"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"124 FAIRIES AT WORK AND AT PLAY state for a long time, doubtless his consciousness was freed from the body. The country all around was much wilder and bleaker than it is at present. and there was a good deal of warfare continually goiag on in different parts, as a result of marauding excursions by surrounding tribes. It would seem that some of the wounds healed during the ceremony had been received in these encounters. Evidently there were many ceremonies at which the priests alone were present. I see them, standing in tho inner circle. saluting the rising sun. On another occasion a ceremony is being performed at night, beneath the star- lit sky. when the attention of the company is directed to a brilliant star, low on the north-western horizon. I notice, also, some system of signalling in operation. for there are people on the summits of Skiddaw and Blen- cathra and Helvellyn whose attention is directed to the circle from which their signals are plainly visible. Apparently beacon fires were used. A system of contemplative discipline was evidently employed by the priests, some of whom possessed tho power of self-entrancement. This temple appears to bo in magnetic contact with a centre of the same religion lying to the south west. and a great way oft. At a later period. when only the memory of this priest remained, he was worshipped almost as a deity by succeed- ing generations. who regarded him as the master and founder of their temple and its worship. A mighty white magician apparently he was. as well as a teacher and lover of his people.

Their shouting dies down to a murmur as he approaches the altar, and in a low voice he blesses them. stretching forth his right hand and waving it slowly over the crowd within the circle. beginning at the south and passing slowly round through the west to the north. All heads are bowed and the whole place becomes perfectly still. and when they look up again he has travelled some distance on his return to his dwelling- place; they watch him with hungry eyes. realising that they have seen him for the last time. Powerful emotion surges through them. many burst into tears and call after him. Among his priests are some young men of exceptional character to whom he has imparted much of his mystic nature lore. and into whose hands is given the task of carrying on the temple worship and ministration after the master has left them. How different is the scene before us now. The sun is setting in a golden glow, the quiet peace of a summer evening is broken only by the distant weird calling of the curlew and the cries of the numbers of young lambs who. with their mothers. are gazing in and about the ancient ring. Much of the old magnetic infiuence remains and can be felt; so strongly impressed on the place are the ancient ceremonies that they rise up continually before the inner eye. Other scenes. far less holy and beautiful, have been enacted here. other priests of dark and fierce aspect have stood within the inner ring. One fierce viking-like figure. wearing a helmet with two horns upreared on each side of his brow. stands with bloody knife beside the altar stone.

Now it is a power from below. which rises as if from the centre of the earth in answer to the invoking call; ugly as sin are the elemental shapes which hover round the ceremonial of blood. Women now live with men down at the ancient monastery, and the pure discipline and self-restraint of other days are gone. In later times this ring, once the centre of such lofty ministrations, was foully desecrated by the followers of the • Lords of the Dark Face,• and still clearly to be felt here is the scene of carnage which followed on the uprising of the surrounding tribes against the iniquities by which they had been overawed for many generations. The priests and priestesses were slain, victims were set free, and in their fury the mob demolished the dwellings at the foot of the hill and overthrew many of the temple stones. Down through the thousands of years which follow, it is the first, the nobler, the uplifting influence which lasts and which is the most strongly impressed upon the place. showing something of the grandeur of the religion of ancient days.\""},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Quest Books encourages open-minded inquiry into world religions, philosophy, science, and the arts in order to understand the wisdom of the ages, respect the unity of all life, and help people explore individual spiritual self-transformation.
