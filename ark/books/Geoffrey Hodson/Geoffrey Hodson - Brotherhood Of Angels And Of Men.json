No Copyright Renewal.ISBN 0-89804-213-5 "},{"pageContent":"FORWARDI have been asked to introduce this book to a sceptical world, and yet a worldin which every religion, each scripture, asserts the fact of the existence ofAngels and of their occasional appearances among men. They may be called by anyname—angels, nature-spirits, devas (shining ones), elementals. Angels or devasis the term often applied to the higher grades, nature spirits, elementaries,fairies, to the lower.At this period of evolution, we are under the influence of a natural force,which will slowly become predominant in every department of nature; it is theforce which works for cooperation between angelhood and humanity and seeks tobuild bridges by which the two great races, human and angelic, may combine fortheir mutual good. These bridges are ceremonies, chiefly in religions and inFreemasonry, for these deal with The Highest spiritual worlds through allworlds, the superhuman, the human, down to the lowest, the sub-human.I have not studied the subject closely, as Mr. Geoffrey Hodson has done, but hisobservations are congruous with the many details in Hindu books and with mygeneral knowledge on the subject, gained in travelling in different countries aswell as by reading. In Hungary, for instance, the nature spirits of the earthseemed specially active, quaint little creatures, veritable gnomes, entirelydifferent from the gorgeous hosts of Kubera in India, though both are concernedwith the mineral kingdom.This book is specially interesting in the suggestions made by the angels of waysof reaching them, and as to mutual cooperation, and many may be inclined to workfor “The Brotherhood of Angels and of Men.”—ANNIE BESANT, D.L.1927 "},{"pageContent":"PREFACEAs I consider a Preface to this reprint of The Brotherhood of Angels and of Men,I find myself in thought and memory back again deep in the woods of the smallvillage of Sheepscombe in Gloucestershire. There, in 1924, as I was endeavouringto observe and record descriptions of the nature-spirit life, I almost suddenlyfound my consciousness translated (if I may use such a term) to the level atwhich I beheld the great Member of the Angelic Hosts who named himself to me,“Bethelda.” While I was fully conscious and able to dictate, he transmitted tome ideas which have gradually become published in five successive books.**The Brotherhood of Angels and of Men, The Angelic Hosts, Be Ye Perfect, Man theTriune God, The Supreme Splendour.Whenever I return to England I always revisit the much-loved village, thecottage and the garden and the woods where my mind became opened to someknowledge of the Kingdom of the Gods. Indeed, a book of that title, illustratedby a South African artist, Miss Ethelwynne Quail, is just now reappearing in itsseventh edition.Thus, I understand, the idea of collaboration between Angels and men in theservice of God and humanity has reached large numbers in many parts of theworld, and the guidance given in this book has been practised beneficially bymany people.I am grateful to the Publishers of these books and especially to Dr. AnnieBesant who so generously encouraged me from the beginning and wrote a Forewordto this work.GEOFFREY HODSON ADYAR, 1973"},{"pageContent":"THE BROTHERHOODOF ANGELS AND OF MEN[0002.png]"},{"pageContent":"1 THE BROTHERHOODThe ideal of this brotherhood is to draw angels and men, two branches of theinfinite family of God, into close cooperation. The chief purpose of suchcooperation is to uplift the human race.To this end the angels, on their side, are ready to participate as closely aspossible in every department of human life and in every human activity thatholds cooperation in view.Those members of the human race who will throw open heart and mind to theirbrethren of the other sphere, will find an immediate response, and a graduallyincreasing conviction of its reality.While the angels make no conditions, and impose no restrictions or limits to theactivities and developments resulting from cooperation, they assume that nohuman brother would invoke them for personal and material gain. They ask for theacceptance of the motto of the Brotherhood[1][http://www.minhtrietmoi.org/Theosophy/Hodson/the%20brotherhood.htm] and itspractical application to human life in every aspect.They ask those who would invoke their presence, to concentrate the whole oftheir faculties on the development of the qualities of Purity, Simplicity,Directness and Impersonality, as well as on the acquirement of knowledge of thegreat Plan whereby the spiritual, intellectual and material constituents,composing alike man and the universe, maintain the ordered march of evolutionaryprogress. In this way the fundamental basis of every human activity will be theteachings and doctrines of that Divine and Ancient Wisdom which has alwaysreigned supreme as the directing influence in the councils of the angels.The special divisions of the angel host with whom cooperation would beimmediately practicable and beneficial are:The Angels of Power.The Angels of Healing.The Guardian Angels of the Home.The Angels who build Form, ever embodying archetypal ideas.The Angels of Nature.The Angels of Music.The Angels of Beauty and Art."},{"pageContent":"ANGELS OF POWERThe Angels of Power will teach men to release the deeper levels of spiritualenergy latent within them, and will fill, inform, inspire and charge every humanactivity with that fiery and resistless energy which is their most prominentcharacteristic. At present, they find in ceremonial a natural medium for theirgifts and for their desire to aid their human brethren. Ceremonial alwaysattracts their attention, and, properly performed, provides a channel throughwhich they can pour their forces. They are present at every religious ceremony,participating according to the measure of their capacity, and to the degreewhich the ceremony itself permits; they can work more powerfully if the mentalattitude of the officiants and participants is receptive."},{"pageContent":"ANGELS OF THE HEALING ARTThe Healing Angels—under their mighty Head, the Archangel Raphael—being filledwith love for their human brethren, pursue their work continuously. Theirpresence by the sick beds of men is a reality, though the minds and hearts ofthe majority of those responsible for healing of sickness are closed againstthem. Many who suffer and have suffered, know them well. They stand in theirthousands on the spiritual and mental thresholds of every sick-room, in hospitalor home, eager to enter in. Hitherto, but few have succeeded, the barriersupraised by human minds are often insuperable; should they break through thesein spite of opposition, the precious healing which they bear in outstretchedarms would be lost, dissipated in the effort to overcome resistance."},{"pageContent":"GUARDIAN ANGELS OF THE HOMEThe Guardian Angels love the homely ways of men, they desire to share the hoursof labour and of ease; they love children and their play, and all the happyatmosphere of the home. They would guard men’s homes, keeping away allinfluences of danger and of strife, of darkness and disease. They hear thechildren’s prayers at night and bear them to the Lord, and they vivify everyhuman thought of love by adding something of their love and life; often theybear the thought on its mission and pour it, illumined and increased, into thereceiver’s heart. They tend the aged and the sick. They are ever ready to shieldfrom harm. To all whose hearts and homes are open to them, they would gladlycome, bringing many blessings from on high—blessings of harmony and love.The Building Angels guide growth in every world, and, shaping it according tothe law, seek ever to improve, to perfect and inspire. Each immortal spark whichfinds birth in worlds of thought, of feeling and of flesh, and, growing, becomesman, owes all its vehicles, or bodies, to the angel builders; so also do everygem, every plant, every animal, every globe, and every universe. They stand ingraded orders, these builders, each labouring at his own height, the lesser onesbuild gems, the greater ones worlds; there are some who build the outer forms ofangels and of men.It is lack of recognition of their place and aid that has made childbirth inlater times a period of agony or death. When men invoke their aid, they willteach the human race how to bring forth their kind with joy, they will see thatthe great sacrifice is no longer marred by fear and cries of agony and woe.These angels who build man, have, as their Queen, a Holy One, who won freedomfrom the burden of the flesh and, ascending joined the Angel Hosts. She laboursever for the cause of human motherhood, and even now is bending all Her mightystrength and calling all Her Angel Court to labour for the upliftment ofwomanhood throughout the world. Through Her angel messengers, She Herself ispresent at every human birth, unseen and unknown, it is true, but if men wouldbut open their eyes She would be revealed.She sends this message through the Brotherhood to men:“In the Name of Him whom long ago I bore, I come to your aid. I have taken everywoman into my heart, to hold there a part of her that through it I may help herin her time of need.“Uplift the women of your race till all are seen as queens, and to such queenslet every man be as a king, that each may honour each, seeing the other’sroyalty. Let every home, however small, become a court, every son a knight,every child a page. Let all treat all with chivalry, honouring in each theirroyal parentage, their kingly birth; for there is royal blood in every man; allare the children of the KING.”"},{"pageContent":"THE ANGELS OF NATUREThe Nature Angels are widely distributed, each dwelling and working in his ownelement. They range from brownie, elf and fairy sprite, through undine andsylph, to the creatures of the fire. The angels of nature are to be foundeverywhere around men’s haunts, in tree, in flower, in stone, in cloud,ensouling every form.The growth of crops, of fruit and flowers, is under their control. It is theywho bring, when men so live as to create them, earthquake and storm and flood.If humanity would invoke their aid, they might learn from them how all the moodsand products of nature may be controlled. The climate and the weather of theworld answer to law; salamander, undine and sylph of storm are but the agents ofthat law.If you would appeal to the gods of Music you must rise to those levels of theSelf where creative energy, creative power, is stored; for the Angels of Musicare but the embodiments of the creative Word of God, the expressions of HisVoice. When He speaks, a mighty burst of song springs from their hearts andpours its resonance throughout the graded order of their race.They sing in their myriads in answer to the Word of God. Their sound is as of amillion harps touched by immortal hands, their voice is like the surging of thesea. From the centre of the Universe, like a mighty tidal flood, their song goesforth in wave on wave of glory, as order after order answers to the Word; theysend the chorus forth, outwards to the confines of the Universe.Creation never ceases. His Voice is heard continually, the Voice of Him Who,seeing visions of extra universal space, of cosmic ideations, speaks, tellingHis vision, and telling, calls the vision forth, creating it in form within HisUniverse. At His Voice Angels of Music leap from His Lips to become the agentsof the power of Sound; all the world of creative power is filled with theharmony of His Voice; and the Angels are to Him as harps, as glorious stringedinstruments, responding to His will. As they sing, they glow with the colour oftheir song. They live in worlds of Light and Sound, they are the expression ofcosmic hues and cosmic song within the limits of a universe.Our Logos is a lens through which the light of myriads of universes passes intoHis own; He is a mighty organ-pipe under the hand of the Absolute. All the Logoiof all the universe answer to the cosmic keyboard on which It plays. Thus Colourand Sound are born, those wondrous twins, and brought within the limitations ofearthly time and space.Every angel, and every man in his true self, glows with that wondrous light,answers to the Divine Song, knows well the tones of the Creative Voice. The trueSelf in man is lens and organ-pipe in miniature; as he sings and glows in answerto the Voice of God he reproduces in his grade but with exactitude, every toneand micro tone of His Voice, every shade of the spectrum of His light. Thesplendours of that rainbow-hued world pass downwards to the lesser self, andthere hover, that even the lowest self may hear.The mission of the Music angels is to bear this radiance of a million prisms,this surging of a million planets, downwards to the ears of men outwards intomaterial worlds, that even tree and plant and mole beneath the earth may hearthe Voice of God and, hearing it, obey. Every sound you hear on earth is an echoof His Voice, and every light in every colour comes from the dazzling radianceof His Eyes.You cannot call these angels down into the lowest self; to see and hear them youmust rise towards their world; as you cross its threshold you will see themighty throng, ever bathed in myriad rainbow hues, ever chanting forth inanthem-tones the Words of God. Through the sound of their trumpets and flutes,the beating of their wings, and through the light of the fiery spendour of theireyes and the radiant beauty of their forms comes the music of their voices. Everthey sing thus and play from birth to death of universes—they remain the choralorchestra of God.They are in need of human ears and human hearts, that through them they maybring our world in tune, that men may answer ever more and more to the sound andrhythm of their song. To them, all men and all angels are instruments, everyfaculty of mind and heart is a string. They watch each newborn race witheagerness, seeing in it the promise of new instruments, a wider range of tone,another organ-pipe to answer to the breath of God. They see the unity of all,know each as part of the one great instrument upon which God plays that which Hehears beyond the realms of time and space. Through this instrument- through allthe manifold music—throbs the beating of His Heart, the rhythm of the universalpulse. All the movements of the stars, the lighting and setting of suns, thebirth of planets and their death, the evolution of the race, the waves thatbreak upon the shore, the rise and fall of continents, the melting of the Polarseas, the beating of the hearts of men, the germination of the seed, all theserespond to the rhythm of the pulsing heart of God.This is the burden of the song the Gods of Music sing."},{"pageContent":"ANGELS OF BEAUTY AND OF ARTEverything divine is beautiful, expressing in its degree the perfect beauty ofthe Absolute.The greater the density in which God limits Himself, the deeper His beauty lieshidden. Some among the Angel hosts, seeing the beauty of their God, themselvesembody it, and take it as their duty in the world of form to aid the builders offorms, that they may fashion all things, never forgetting the beauty of thepattern by which they work.These Angels of Beauty seek to mould both growing and completed forms; that moreand more the hidden loveliness may shine forth. As Music angels are the voice ofGod, these angels are His Hand, with which He paints upon the canvas of theuniverse the picture of the vision He has seen.Every time a man aspires towards the Beautiful, and tries to model, paint ordraw according to The Highest he can see, he makes himself akin to the angels ofthe Hand of God; for a time their rhythm becomes his. If he called them theywould come and add their vision to his own, their genius of colour and of form,would wake in him their thirst for all things beautiful, would strive tostimulate his mind to break the conventions and the limitations of his time.They would implant new theories, fresh ideals within his brain; so that thetendency of human mind to set a limit and fix a law would be overcome, andcreative genius, hid deep as though within a prison, would be released. So hissoul would be set free, and mounting on the wings of art might attain the visionthat is ever new, might override the canons of the past; for even the Beauty ofGod is subject to the law of change, and grows in splendour day by day.The Angels of Colour and of Form would bring to man this growing beauty, thisever- increasing wonder, this infinite loveliness of God, that every man mightshare with them the honour which is theirs of acting as the Hand of the SupremeArtist. Invoke angels in your schools of art, invite them to your aid; thenugliness shall be banished and all the world be more beautiful.Their message to men is that Beauty ranks high among the offerings on the altarof the Gods, that Beauty should be regarded as a virtue, and ugliness be brandedas a sin; that every child from birth should see only what is lovely, gracefuland delicate.Beauty is not born, nor can it die, it is eternal. Only a fragment of Beauty’sself can become manifest, only a gleam from the eternal Sun of Beauty can shinethrough a universe; men seeing it, and dazzled by the sight, think that they seethe whole, though the whole can never be seen by angel or by man. But thefragment grows, the radiance of the gleam increases, as more and more theuniverse embodies it. More and more the Self and Beauty appears as one inmanifested worlds, as they are one in worlds unmanifest.True beauty is ever new; and this is the sign by which you may distinguishbetween the false and the true. False beauty, product of the lesser selves,changes not, is fixed, and like all things that are “fixed” in a universe whichis ever growing, is old from the moment it is born.As there is a motion throughout the universe, so motion must be suggested bytrue beauty. There is no beauty in a picture of death, though death itself isnot without beauty. Beauty is the soul of all natural things, and lies hid inevery virtue, especially love. You need no other standard, require no other law;nor is there any other virtue so great as the love of the beautiful, for beautyis the essence of them all.Every law you frame, and every statue you enact, should be tested by thisquestion: “Will the result be beautiful?” This is the ideal by which a citizenshould measure his conduct and his duty to the State. This is the standard forthe nations in their Councils and their Leagues, for with one glance the artistRuler of a world can estimate the worth of governments and kings. To Him, themeasure of a nation’s ugliness is the measure of its mismanagement of affairs;the measure of a nation’s beauty, as of the true royalty of its king, is that ofthe progress it has made. Welcome, then, as continents, as nations, as men, thepresence of the angels of the Hand of God, the Devas of Beauty, for they willfill your worlds of feeling and of thought with such an impress of their giftthat your more solid selves will be unable to resist. Aided by the angels of theHand of God, all men may become artists, for the Vision Splendid will come soclose that even the dullest eyes must see. Poets, dreamers, painters, sculptors,will arise in every family, till all the world becomes a studio, and earth andstone and brick are recognised as clay for the modeller’s hand.You shall build cities fairer than were ever seen in Greece, for you are Greecereincarnate; but you have grown since then; the angels who taught in Greece havegrown since then. Together we might fill whole continents with cities fairerthan those of old.You shall mould your thoughts, your feelings and your flesh; you shall build aRace godlike in its beauty and its strength; the angel hosts will come to aidyou in your task.This is the vision of the future that we bring, a future of limitlesspossibilities of splendour, when once more the children of God, angels and men,come together for the fulfilment of the Plan."},{"pageContent":"2 THE FIRST MESSAGESince the Great One has drawn so close to our world and to yours, it is of firstimportance that the bridge between the two should be fash- ioned, that the timemay be hastened when it may be used freely from either side. We must devisebetter means of communication; and your studies might well have for their objectthe widening of the bridge and the instruction of your brethren in its use. Theywill find us coming more than halfway to meet them, for the Lord Himself hasdecreed that we should draw together in closer bonds of unity.The first essential on your side is a belief in our existence; to that end, moreinformation about us must be given, and presented in such a manner that it willbe acceptable to the scientist as well as to the poet, the artist and thedreamer. In your scientific studies, as they take you deeper into thesuperphysical realms, be ever observant of our place in the manipulation andadjustment of nature’s forces. Behind every phenomenon you will find a member ofour race. Our position in nature is closely akin to that of the engineer; he isnot the force himself; he directs it, and as his constant care and oversight areessential to the efficient running of the machine, so the angels, or devas,[2][http://www.minhtrietmoi.org/Theosophy/Hodson/the%20brotherhood.htm] areessential to the efficient running of the great machine of nature, as well as ofeach individual engine of which it is composed, from atom to archangel. So longas the presence of our invisible hosts is ignored by science there will be gapsin their knowledge, gaps which can only be filled by a comprehension of ourplace in the scheme of things.That knowledge is not likely to be obtained by the use of physical instruments;and, therefore, the second essential is an increase in the number of humanbeings able to contact us. Perhaps the easiest means of approach will be foundto be through the love of nature. Those who would find us must learn to contactnature far more intimately than is at present possible to the average man. Inaddition to a deeper appreciation of the beauty of nature, there must be thatreverence for all forms and moods, for all her manifold expression, whichsprings from a recognition of the presence of the Divine of which these forms,moods and beauties are but the outward expression. From such an appreciationthere will arise naturally a realisation of the sacred nature of all beauty, anda desire to draw near to the divinity within. Beyond that again, a living senseof unity with nature must be reached, till you can see yourself in every tree,in every flower, in every blade of grass, in every passing cloud, and realisethat the manifold diversities which compose a valley or a garden or a widepanorama of mountain, sea and sky, are but expressions of the One Self which isin you, of which you are a part, by means of which you can pierce the externalveil of beauty till it can hide from you no longer the vision of the Self. Whenthis realisation has been gained, you will be on the threshold of our world, youwill have learned to see with our eyes and to know with our minds and to feelwith our hearts.This capacity alone, however, will not suffice, for it is as yet a path whichfew can tread. It may, nevertheless, be regarded as the broad highway leading tothe bridge.Every true artist has gone along that road, yet few have found us; for theenquiring mind of the scientist and the penetrating gaze of the seer must beadded to the sensitiveness of the artist. The scientist must learn to beginwhere the artist leaves off, and, placing himself within the central heart ofnature, pursue his investigations outwards towards the circumference. He willnot lose in his self-realisation that clarity of mind, that exactitude ofobservation, which he so rightly prizes, but he will direct them from a newpoint of view. He must place his mind inside the tree, the plant, the animal,the element, the atom he would study; and to do this he must first follow thepath of the artist and the poet, the philosopher and the metaphysician,combining the capacities of each within himself. The realisation of the angelworld will gradually begin to illumine his consciousness and, through it, everyproblem to which his mind is turned.Let him first gain the necessary technique of the laboratory and the textbook,and then, forsaking these for a time, let him meditate, preferably amid thebeauties of nature, appealing to us for guidance and for aid. If he be sincere,knowledge will surely come to him.Next comes the way of ceremony, where divine ideas, words of power and precisionof action are combined in a manner closely corresponding to that by which theangels work. Let all the churches and all the priests who seek this way, throwopen their minds and their work to us, grant us a greater share in theirbeneficent activities. Members of the angel hosts are hovering over the heads ofall congregations, standing beside every priest; yet how often do they findthemself shut out by barriers upraised by human minds. Let priest andcongregation alike throw their minds open to a recognition of our presence intheir midst, and invoke our aid; soon, very soon, some will begin to hear thebeating of our wings, to feel an added power in their work, and, later, anincreasing happiness in their lives. Like Him Who has come, we bring the messageof happiness—we, who are expressions of bliss divine, we for whom pain is not,nor sorrow, nor parting, nor death, nor any injury, but only joy, light andever- increasing power, as we learn to express more and more of that Will Divinefrom which we sprang.For us, the cornucopia of life is ever full to overflowing and from itsabundance we would feed humanity. The happiness which never fades, but growsuntil it becomes an ecstasy of bliss, shall be theirs. Preach, then, yeministers of God, the Gospel of Happiness, in His Name and in ours. Would youbut throw open the doors of your hearts and minds to us, doors which, in spiteof the ancient teaching of your faiths, are fast locked against us, we wouldfill your churches, mosques and temples.The healer, too, might invoke us to come to his aid. The sick beds of men callus, who know no pain. Wonders of healing might be performed if we might comefreely. To attain this end, you must combine healing with religion, withceremonial, as well as with the artist’s vision of reality. In every institutionfor the care of the young, the sick and the aged, there should be established amagnetic centre which we could use as a focus: it should be a room set apart andmade beautiful, consecrated by the proper ceremonial, which would have as itsobject the invocation of Raphael and his healing angels, and of establishing anatmosphere in which they could work. No great gift of knowledge would be neededto do this, only sincerity and vision; the room might be shaped like an octagon,with an altar towards the East, candles and the symbols of the religion of thecountry placed thereon, and a figure of the founder of their Faith, incense,holy water and fragrant flowers. Every morning a ceremony of invocation of theangels should be performed, and every evening a service of thanksgiving.[3][http://www.minhtrietmoi.org/Theosophy/Hodson/the%20brotherhood.htm] In everyward or sickroom, a little shrine might be similarly consecrated and similarlyemployed. Then every doctor would become a priest, every nurse an acolyte; weshould come and heal through them, helping in a hundred ways.In the home life of man a place for us might be found. In some countries, thepeople invite our presence, but even there, from long continued usage, oldcustoms have lost their life, remaining largely as empty forms. Adaptationssuited to western civilisation might well be devised by those who wish to crossthe bridge into our world.Again, perhaps, the most suitable method would be the provision of a shrine setapart and used exclusively for invocations and offerings to the angels. In alltimes of need, sudden crises, sicknesses, births, and deaths, the aid of theAngels would be gladly given, but the power would be greater and the presencesmore real if magnetised centres were provided in the home. A single object ofgreat beauty, mentally associated with the angels and with nature, a bowl offlowers, freshly gathered every day, incense, the use of a short prayer orinvocation each morning, and a benediction each evening, would suffice. Completecleanliness, an atmosphere of utter purity, and the single motive of cooperationfor mutual help, are essential; while added to the simple ceremony might be anappropriate reference to the Founder of the religion of the house, and a prayer,perhaps, for His Blessing upon both angels and men.These few examples will be sufficient to suggest a general method of communionand cooperation, for which variations may be devised for particular purposes;for example, in the studio of the artist, the surgery, the consulting room, theconcert hall, the lecture room; everywhere, in fact, where angels may beusefully employed. Further fields of mutual cooperation await us in the realmsof horticulture and agriculture.While these practices would not immediately produce a large number of peoplecapable of entering into direct communication with the angels—even if this weredesirable or necessary—they would gradually effect a change in the consciousnessof the people, a change which would tend to make such communication more easilypossible. This development would show itself particularly among the children,who, growing up in such an atmosphere, would have every facility for developingand using powers of communication.Many other beneficial results might be expected, culminating in a generalraising of the whole tone of human life and thought, which would tend to becomemore sensitive, refined and responsive, as a result of contact with angelconsciousness. In time this would begin to affect the actual appearance of thephysical body, as well as its movements and gestures; the arts and graces oflife would begin to be more generally appreciated and expressed.For those of humanity who find within themselves a natural response to theseideas and an instinctive desire to apply them, centres and communities for theirpractical use might be formed in the more remote country places. Every communityor centre, formed with spiritual purposes, would find its work greatly increasedin value, range and power by the recognition of the presence of angels, and thepractice of cooperation with them.This valley[4][http://www.minhtrietmoi.org/Theosophy/Hodson/the%20brotherhood.htm] is welladapted for such endeavours, and it is not unlikely that, in the near future,centres, both of the Ancient Wisdom and of the new religion, will be formed andgrow here; centres in which an increasing recognition and cooperation will beobtained from both the human and angel workers. Both magnetically andhistorically, this valley is particularly suitable for the work; whatevermethods are attempted, their success will be greatly enhanced by cooperation. Avery great readiness to combine will be shown by the angels of this district,provided always that the work has as its basis the ideals and ideas of theAncient Wisdom.On the physical plane, the preparation and building of the form is your work; onthe inner planes, we will combine with your superphysical selves in pouring inthe life, in stimulating the inner growth, in the protection of the centre fromintrusion, and in the conservation of the power generated.A centre here might serve both a working community and those who seek a retreatfor meditation and study; the measure of its success will be greatly increasedif the conception of human and angel cooperation is kept continually to thefront and the suggestion to employ such cooperation is made to all who comewithin its sphere of influence. Developments might be expected which would bethe provision of a sanatorium and rest house— a semi-monastic institution—as aretreat, for purposes of study, meditation and investigation, with departmentsfor literature, arts and crafts, dramatic representations, dancing and rhythmicexercises. The successful initiation of such schemes might produce a resultwhich would serve as a model for the establishment of similar centres in otherparts of the world.The essential factor for success in cooperation between us is the mentalrealisation of its possibility, and the continual recollection and employment ofit, in the mental world, in every piece of work which is undertaken. Anyone whowill earnestly practise this will almost inevitably develop the power to realisethe presence and cooperation of the angels, and their never failing response tocalls for aid. It should be made clear that this conception must be preserved inits simplest form, entirely free from all sensationalism or elaborateceremonial, nor is it suggested that any attempt should be made to obtain aclose personal contact with individual angels, or to employ them from motives ofpersonal gain, interest or curiosity; such endeavours would almost inevitablylead to disaster and should be rigorously excluded. It must be as natural foryou to work with the angels as with each other or with domestic animals. Asalready stated, the qualities of Simplicity, Purity, Directness andImpersonality must characterise all who hope to take part successfully in anymutual endeavours. The excitable, emotional, or unbalanced individual may notsafely be brought into contact with the great forces working behind and throughthe angel evolution. Men and women with extremely practical and controlledminds, possessing also capacities for idealism and positive imagination, areideal workers; these types should be sought for the initiation of schemes wherehuman-angel cooperation is to be employed.Though the world at large may deride our aspirations, a growing response isassured. There exists within the human heart and mind an instinctive attractionin these directions; it springs in part at least from ancient memories of thosetimes when angels walked with men, and partly from the natural seer- ship latentin every human soul."},{"pageContent":"3 THE SECOND MESSAGEThe Angels ask from you, not worship—for that would be inappropriate—but love;asking only to be allowed to join with you in praise and thanksgiving to Him Whois the Father of us all, and in adoration of the Supreme Teacher of Angels andof Men. The power of our prayers will be enhanced by being offered up withyours; your lives will be enriched by the answer to our common act of praise.Our sphere of usefulness to God will be enlarged by sharing yours; your liveswill be enriched, your world made glad, by the inauguration of the Brotherhoodof Angels and of Men. The aim of the Brotherhood is to widen the range of humanlove by including the angels within its rosy glow, so that the concept ofbrotherhood, the keynote of the coming age, shall know no bounds, but widen toinclude all living things, mortal and immortal—the dwellers in the etherealworlds of air, fire and water—the people of the limitless dominions of Space.The time approaches when they will no longer remain invisible to you, for as youthrow open your worlds to them, so will they cease to resist your entry intotheirs; throwing wide their doors they will invite you to pass the portal,offering you full share of those treasures of incalculable value which they haveguarded so long. It is love that will open the doors; love between yourselvesfirst, so that you can never misuse the gifts they will bestow; love also forthem, your brethren, to whom your love will give the power to reveal themselves.The angels send their love and greeting to you, holding out their hands infellowship, as bidden by the Lord, Who recently has come again to you and them.Surrounded by angels, as of old, He comes, and we, His servants, bear Hismessage of brotherhood and love, “Be of the same mind, one with another, forthere is but oneLife, boundless and inexhaustible, which is the very essence of you all. Go tothe children of men, draw close to them once more, that those days may bebrought back again when angels walked with men. Do this, it is the will of God.”Having this command laid upon us we come to you, and to many another listeningone, offering you our service and our love, that His will be done.What will your answer be, men of earth?We wait on that. We would light a fire in your hearts that you may feel the glowof the same great flame that burns within us, the flame of divine Life, thatrestores as it consumes, ever renewing its fiery power in the lives of those inwhom it burns. That is the meaning of the angel life, this is the secret of theangel fire, the fire divine which burns continually; it is the flame which leapsfrom that immortal spark, our innermost Selves, which springs from the centralfiery heart of the universe—the Spiritual Sun.All your faculties will be increased, and all your powers enhanced, till lifebecomes an ecstasy, till unsuspected beauty reveals itself in everything, tillundreamed-of capacity for love, for life, for happiness, arises within you. Thusyou shall find your way to that Kingdom of Happiness, of ecstasy, of bliss, towhich our Lord in His divine compassion would lead you.All this, and more, awaits you in the future, a future that shall be near or faraccording to your response to Him and to His angel hosts. He desires to open anew world to you—new yet older than yourselves—to open to you Kingdoms yetinvisible; He will remove the scales from your eyes, and the vision splendidwill be yours.Come into that Kingdom, the land of immortality in which we dwell, and sharewith us the joys which never fail, the splendours of a world where death isunknown, where separation is not, nor any pain. Let the beauty, the power andthe joy of the vision flow down into your world, healing its distress, relievingits drudgery, ugliness and vice, that all men may lift up their heads in pride,having once more become the gods they ought to be.Begone the sunken eye, the withered cheek, the scowling glance, the shamed mien,the ugly home. Let Life be beautiful for all, not for the few alone; for He Whocomes, comes to all, and He would remove these dark blots upon your race, for Hesees the God within you struggling to be free.These lives—dark, drear, dull as the tomb- must be made glad, must be filledwith joy, must be given the freedom which He bids you give.Raise up the evolving god; do not press Him down or bury Him deeper and deeperin the mire of your own selfishness. So shall all be lifted up, a fairer raceshall be born, a nobler type evolve, and a more worthy temple be reared of humanbodies, happy, healthy, strong and free, fit dwellings for the God hidden withinthem.He comes to help you to this end. To help you and Him we come, offeringourselves to you. We, who have not felt the cramping and deadening weight ofearth, honour you for your great pilgrimage so far from His Face— from Whom yousprang—so deep into the dense material worlds. Now that your faces are turnedhomeward, He bids us sing the welcoming song; He bids us meet you on the way,and, joining hands with you, lead you more swiftly along the Path of Return backto His abode, the Dwelling Place of Light."},{"pageContent":"4 THE HIGHESTThere is too much satisfaction with that which is not the highest, and notenough readiness to aim higher and higher still in all things that are done.Even in the pleasant talk of friends, there should always be upheld the idealthat thought and word and deed should be the highest; because this is not so,the keen edge of heart and mind is blunted, the sense of greatness falls away,lesser things come into and clog the soul, delaying its progress on the Path.These things should not be, need not be; even little things are great for thosewho continually aspire. Make something great of all things. The walk, the drive,the fireside talk, all the household ways, all your earthly obligations, yourpleasures and your pains, your strivings and your times of ease—let them begreat, the greatest that, so far, has dawned within you—the highest you canreach.Let this be the motto for you all—THE HIGHEST—and let all who join our rankspledge themselves to that motto. We, too, will pledge ourselves, and every timethis inward pledge is uttered by a man, an angel shall repeat his pledge andbear it like a torch to add to the great reservoir of power apportioned for ourwork. Let each who would so pledge himself, retire into solitude, the privateroom, some grassy height, some woodland shade, or, if he needs them not, intothe chamber of his heart. There with fixed purpose let him first meditate,seeking to penetrate into the depth and meaning of our great ideal; then, havingenvisaged it, let him make firm resolve that he will ever strive towards itthroughout this and his future lives; remembering that to the great all thingsare great.Thus, perchance, we may remove the blight that threatens your race, the blightof apathy; in which you are sunk so deep that only wars, earthquakes, fires andfloods, famines and sudden death can stir your somnolence. Your higherselves—your angel selves—strive continually to awaken you, to send a visionthrough your dreams, and here and there a sleeper stirs and stretches, all toooften to return to sleep; your dreams must be disturbed by the force of thingsexternal to your selves. Wars come to rouse you, and you pray to God to save youfrom more wars! Pestilence and famine stride hand in hand across your heedlesslives, and only as you see them threatening your repose do you awake, and, for atime, become your greatest selves. Yet from these, you pray unto your Lord,asking Him to deliver you! The deliverer from these is with you all the while,it is your innermost self; but as you will not be aroused by the Self withinyou, you must be awakened by the Self without. Know that in wars, plagues,cataclysms, you see yourselves, the expressions of your soul, striding torch inhand, through the dormitories in which your bodies lie, to stir you from yoursleep, to drive away the dark shadows of self-satisfaction and content. Theseother selves of yours will come again and again until you yourselves banish themfor all time. They go from the nation, from those men, who, answering to THEHIGHEST, live according to its laws; who seeing the greatest, strive ever toexpress it, who neither rest nor sleep, filled with a craving which drives themonwards from peak to peak of the mountains of the spiritual world. That is theway to release, brothers, and there is none other. HE who tells you that war maycease by act of law, does worse than lie; he covers up the truth, so that men,feeling safe, sink back again into their dreams—and war returns in due season.In our Brotherhood, we must begin to hold aloft this great idea—THE HIGHEST—andeach must pledge himself that nothing else will satisfy his soul. You mustpreach this gospel—that the cause of all things, good and ill, lies withinourselves, that the good may be made better and the bad disappear, only byaction from within. It is the lives of men you must reform, not their laws;lives can only change when they conform to THE HIGHEST, instead of trifling withthe lowest.No man can plead that he does not know these things. Messenger after messengerhas come and spread the truth abroad. It is you who have locked up such truthsin temple, church, and mosque, and taken refuge in the courts of law, tillself-denial is unknown, and is displaced by denial of the Self. Still you laughcontemptuously, when told that love shall save the world—or purity, or truth, orlaw, or sacrifice. You have hardened your hearts; yet He still comes, theembodiment of love, purity and truth, of law and sacrifice, to teach you onceagain the ancient truths, lest war—an even greater war—should take His place asTeacher of Angels and of Men.Let this be our motto and our password, the sign by which we know each other byday and night—THE HIGHEST. Seek an artist friend that he may draw a picture of amember of the angel host standing upon a globe and pointing to the sky, andunderneath— “THE HIGHEST.” Call it “The Angel of the Pointing Hand”; make itinto badge and talisman, bless it with power and love and courage to achieve,that all who wear it may be filled with divine discontent and a craving for THEHIGHEST, a longing for the goal. Learn to make the form in the mental worlds andfill it with your desire, and send it out to men. Charge it to the full withyour will; call upon an angel to ensoul it with his life, until you fill themental world with glowing forms of angel kind which shall call to the mentalselves of men, shall wake them from their sleep. Flood the mental world withthis ideal, the ideal of THE HIGHEST."},{"pageContent":"5 PATIENCECan you conceive an eagerness to work, so great that even our bodies seem nearto breaking under its power, yet an eagerness combined with patience that canwait a thousand years? To that sublime patience you must attain, for within thequality of patience are enclosed a multitude of virtues, strength to control,power to restrain, vision of the Plan, knowledge of the real, detachment fromresults and coordination of the will, the mind, the body, so that when the timecomes they act as one. Patience of this kind does not extinguish the fire ofeagerness to serve, rather does it glow ever more fiercely within thecompression exercised by will and mind. When at last the order comes, when,after the passing of an age, the day arrives when the restraints are to bereleased, then it is that the power stored up for so long flashes forth throughus. We become the catapults of God.Now that day has come; stored-up energies, resulting from the power of the greatideal, have been released into your world. Fear not the result; the end is sure.Not for nought have your Hierarchy and ours planned, from time beyond your powerto count, ever waiting for the arrival of the day; so I say the end is sure.Still they plan, for ages yet unborn, great schemes, embodying the divine Will;in detail, too, down to the angels and the men they choose. What, then, are webut incidents, straws, blown by the breath of God, except that within thosestraws the self-same breath is found, so that breath answers to breath, and HisWill is done.Remember always that the ultimate source of power is in the idea, the power weuse in manifested worlds is but the force emanating from and the reflection ofthe divine Idea. If this be true, then no delay can reduce its potency, nor anycircumstance prevent its ultimate expression. Upon this knowledge shouldpatience be based."},{"pageContent":"6 PEACEPeace is an essential principle in nature, not merely a quality to be acquired;it belongs to the innate essence of all things, and, like love, is a cohesiveprinciple. Behind all movement there is rest; behind all sound there isstillness; so that behind the motion and the music of the spheres there ispeace—the equipoise of God. Though all His planets and all His people move, Heis motionless, and nought is there within His wide dominions that can disturbHis peace, so firmly founded. You, too, if you would achieve, must find thatpeace, that power of divine equipoise which nothing in the outer world canshake, which no untoward circumstance can destroy. I would have you turn yourthoughts to this great discovery, the discovery of that within yourselves whichis a reflection of the peace of God. It is not your own, it is not a qualitywhich you will acquire; it is a power that you will release; it is thegyroscopic centre of your soul. At first it is like an isolation of the soul, sodeep is its stillness, utterly devoid of sound.The way to this realm of peace lies through the mind, for the roads which leadtowards, its boundaries are paved with thought; over, those roads the soul musttread. Therefore, by thought you must begin. Think frequently peace; mistake itnot for quiet, nor any condition of external things, however noiseless howeverstill; you must plunge deeper, into the innermost recesses of the soul, in questof the land of peace. It is not of the mind nor of the heart, though the essenceof both is rooted deep within it. Meditate on peace, thus will you pave the roadwhich you must tread later so that it be smooth and easy for your feet as youwalk and near the frontier, the sense of manifested life will gradually fallaway, you will feel alone. Fear not, 'tis but the aura of the land of peacewhich stretches far and wide and meets you on the road; enter it, and let itspower strengthen you for the later stages of the quest; as the stillness deepensaround you, welcome it and let it permeate your soul, till every nerve, everyatom, seems to find rest.Mistake not this deep reflection for the goal itself, as many have done; peacelies still deeper, the innermost recesses must be explored; even while allnature seems to pause, and the goal almost to be won, press on your quest. Thedrawbridge is down, the portcullis raised; press on, for, compared to the peacewhich now awaits you, that which you just have known is as discord and turmoil,as far from reality as earthly fire is from the spiritual sun, yet related toit, and therefore to be encountered on the way; it was external peace and notyour own. Pass then through the gates, and be lost in that which is yourself;fall into the abyss, plunge into the pool, which, though it seems butnothingness, is everything—the pool of peace.Think deeply on these words, my brothers, and try the quest. It is part of ourangel discipline, the schooling of the angel hosts; lacking the anchorage whichyour earthly bodies give to you, the devas are useless in great tasks till theyhave found that stable point within their inmost depths, which serves them, asyour bodies serve your minds, for leverage; lacking flesh, they have to find thefulcrum deep within. Why should you not find it, too, and, having both the innerfulcrum and the flesh, preserve that outer poise unshakeable which is theexpression of spiritual peace, the final, deepest point of self, beyond whichself is not?It was from this source, so deep within, that the power was released which theraging tempest on the Galilean sea could not gainsay; it was from that land thatHe spoke, saying unto wind and wave: “Peace, be still.” Though it is no earthlypeace, it wields a power that all earthly things must own—resistless in itsmight. When He gave His peace to His own, saying: “Not as the world giveth, giveI,” He spoke from that same inner land. Thence came also the power which,through His music, tamed the wildest and most warlike creatures of the Thracianwilds, which drew down the branches of the trees and held them still, whichforced the lion and the tiger and the snake to lose their fierceness and theirlust and become quiet, for Orpheus sang, “Peace, be still.” And ever, where Hispresence is, there is peace—there motion seems to cease.So, He who lives forever in that land of eternal equipoise, comes bringingpeace, and as He, coming thence, brings peace to the world, so may you—drawingon the self-same source, the deepest point, the stable point, the point of restwithin yourselves—find peace, and the warfare of your lower selves will cease.You too must acquire the magic of that far-off land which shall give to yourvoice the power to say “Peace, be still.” None living in these outer worlds canresist that power; the wildest sylph, the fiercest creature of the fire, theelementals of the storm, the earthquake, the volcano, and the flood, must staytheir mighty onrush, their resistless, vivid play, at the command of him who cantruly say, “Peace, be still.”This peace is the essence of all beautiful things. The quiet hour, the peacefulscene, the home fireside, the clasping hands of those who love, the worship ofthe devotee, the adoration of the saint, the blessing of the Gods—all these haveas their essence, peace, and without peace their beauty is gone. Therefore, winpeace.Your peoples have so much which would be beautiful but is not, for want ofpeace; you ape the beautiful yet achieve it not, for want of peace; nearly allyour art is spoiled by too much striving and by want of peace. Only the greatestof your men of fire have truly achieved great art, great in the measure of peaceit enshrines; yet everything that grows—the gem, the rose, the weed, the insect,the animal, the man—is beautiful. All are the achievements of an art whichsprings from peace-like lotus flowers, resting on the surface of the pool.O, my brothers, if you would but give the world this one message, asking men toseek peace; not the freedom from the clash of arms, not absence of civil orindustrial strife, not lessening of the claims from man to man, for these arebut the husks, the chaff, which flies into the air at the grinding of the karmicmills. If you would escape the karmic debt of war, you must lead the souls ofmen to that land of spiritual peace, in which to contemplate and find, each forhimself, the Peace Divine.If you would but emulate the silent-footed devas of the air, who live theirlives, not in soundlessness, but in song; whose every moment is a harmony, whoseevery thought paints a bright picture on the canvas of the sky, whose veryheartbeats are whisperings of joy! When you tell men that we come, ask them thisboon in our name—that they will cultivate peace. Life must, indeed, be motion,and motion sound; but let all the sounds of human life bring harmony, and letthem learn to make their path melodious and sweet. Teach them to listen to themusic of the trees, show them the way firs and pines and beeches live, swayingto the wind and singing all the time. They have swayed and sung since Time was;now they are incapable, in any circumstances, of stridency or discord in theirsong.So near, oft-times, do we come, hoping that you will hear the beating of ourwings, and yet we fail, and often must retire, driven away, almost with horror,at the sounds and forms emitted by your ways of living. Appeal for the abolitionof every sound which might hurt the ear of a child, in city, in street, incountry lane, in factory, farm, or field, so that gradually you will haveremoved this impassable barrier of noise, which you have erected between ourworld and yours. Teach your people to cultivate the quiet hour, to learn the joyof peace, the mood of silent happiness, for these are the obvious ways of humanlife, these should be the natural expression of your lives; if you have notattained to these how can we teach the deeper paths of peace, the superhumanway, how lead you past your normal selves into the land where God is seen,walking in His garden of peace?Inaugurate a great campaign, bid all those who come later to help, that thisgreat wave of ugliness and violence shall pass, for this chance is an essentialpreliminary to the realisation of our mutual ideals. Though ordered by thePrince of Peace, though filled with the love of the Lord of Love, we cannot comeuntil you quieten all your lives and listen to our knock upon your door, to ourfootfall beside your hearths. Discord and ugliness must vanish from the world;to remove it is our task and yours—but yours first. Rewards are promised, evenat the beginning of your task, for you shall hear such music, you shall see suchbeauty as will exceed your noblest dreams, when we come bearing our gifts tomen—gifts that can be given only to a world ready to receive them, gifts thatcannot be withheld, when once the preparation has been made; for, throughout alltime, these have been the gifts of the angels—music and beauty; every qualityand every movement of the God within the angel finds expression through these.Love, one for another, between us, shows itself in bursts of song; with us,great thoughts are symphonies; and, as we answer love to love, and thought tothought, all the air about us is filled with tones and supertones, withharmonies, songs, chants and great chorales; not manufactured as something toshow our gifts, but as beauties which cannot be withheld, beauties which springforth full-born, natural expressions of our intercourse, our lives of love andlabour, in our own world.You, too, make pictures every time you think; you, too, make music every timeyou feel, and light and colour and form as well; and these things might shineresplendent and beautiful in your world, the beauty of their music might fillyour ears. These things are all about you, modified, it is true, but you knowthem not. You do not live for beauty, your lives are not spent ever listeningfor a song; furthermore, you spoil your songs, your forms, your light, by greedand selfishness and vice. These errors would quickly vanish if you but heard andsaw the monstrous sounds and sights that spring from them.Seeing all we see, do you wonder that the angels weep, beholding Gods fallen solow?"},{"pageContent":"7 EDUCATIONThis is the way of the teacher; first to uplift the soul; second, to expand themind; thirdly, to vivify the understanding, and fourthly; to co-ordinate body,mind and soul.To teach you, I must first call you up into the land of joy,[5][http://www.minhtrietmoi.org/Theosophy/Hodson/the%20brotherhood.htm] that youmay stand in the presence of knowledge.Knowledge is truth arranged in sequences; knowledge is truth mirrored in thehuman soul; knowledge is the life-aspect of learning— the twain should never beconfused. Knowledge is the synthesis of all that learning gives; knowledge isunity as it finds expression in the realm of ideas.Knowledge differs from wisdom. Wisdom ever grows, knowledge is stationary;wisdom is the self of knowledge, knowledge is wisdom expressed as ideas; wisdomis innate within the human soul, the human soul must acquire knowledge. Whenknowledge is gained, it is no longer required; knowledge is only useful as a keyto unlock the hidden wisdom. Knowledge belongs to the unreal; wisdom to thereal. Knowledge dies, wisdom is eternal; knowledge is the odour, wisdom is theflower; knowledge is light, wisdom is the sun; knowledge is the picture, wisdomis the vision, the soul of man is the artist.To the teacher, the pupil is the artist who will translate wisdom to knowledgeafter he has found wisdom through knowledge. The teacher must teach wisdom, notknowledge. The mission of the teacher is to elevate the pupil, to place him inthe presence of knowledge, that he may reach out his hand to such knowledge, ashe may desire-the teacher watching all the while, guiding the selection,influencing the expression, of that which is acquired. When the pupil isfamiliar with knowledge, the teacher shows him how to use it as a key with whichto unlock the hidden wisdom. As the doors swing wide and wisdom is revealed, theteacher withdraws; thereafter watches from afar.Wisdom cannot be revealed until the soul is lifted up, therefore, let allteachers-to-be learn first to lift up the souls of men.Teaching should begin by prayer, so that the pupil may learn to free his soulfrom earthly things. Being free, he must mount on wings of prayer, that his soulmay be lifted up. Having lifted him to heights where knowledge dwells, theteacher should support the pupil, holding him by the hand until he learns theequipoise of that unaccustomed land. Then, and then only, may the teacher beginto teach.There is but one way to teach; that is by sharing, for that is the way Godteaches, and every teacher should be to his pupil as a God. The art of teachingis the art of God; that is His purpose in His universe, to educate. All teachersshould aspire to be Godlike, for, being Gods in miniature, all their workbecomes divine.The teachers of a nation should be its noblest sons, its greatest men. Theyshould learn to elevate their souls, should find those hidden pathways throughthe mind which lead from brain to wisdom, from wisdom back to brain. They shoulduse these daily, till all the ways of flesh, of feeling, thought, ideas andwisdom, are as familiar lands. The teacher must survey these lands, each in itsturn, until he has distilled the essence of them all, has learned to stand andto be free in each world. Then, and only then, can he truly educate. Then onlycan he guide his pupil’s feet along the path which he has trodden, then leavethe pupil free to use the pathway for himself.For the teacher, wisdom is the highest; for the pupil, will. The teacher shouldnot begin to teach until he has touched the highest, lest he should err in thelowest. But, having learned the secret whereby wisdom is revealed, and havingkept the pathway free, seated in wisdom, he can order all his actions in thelower world according to wisdom’s decree. Then will he be worthy to teach, forwisdom cannot err.With wisdom he will examine his pupil’s body, especially its brain, the organwith which he is concerned; he will order all the pupil’s earthly life, thatbrain and body may be developed to express wisdom; for nothing less should behis aim. The body must be supple, loose and free; the brain elastic, sensitive,responsive to what is high, unresponsive to what is low. Carefully, day by day,nay, even hour by hour, the teacher should watch the growth of the body and ofbrain. The earthly life should be suffused continually with joy, he should notpermit even the shadow of a pain; for pain is the teacher of maturity, pain isthe teacher of the pupil’s later years, not of his youth.The qualities of joy and freedom must be developed to the utmost in the child;this is essential to ultimate success. Failing this, growth will be warped, bodyand brain will harden, the higher faculties be dulled. All the food and clothingof the child must be light, yet containing also the elements of strength. Purityshould surround him from his birth; all that is gross should be rigorously keptaway. Thus only may the body grow to be light and strong, pure, joyous and free.Having these, the basic factors of his growth, all else will follow naturally;virtue will develop, vice will gain no hold.On these, the teacher’s basic principles, the curriculum should be based.If the child should err, let the teacher blame himself; he has not taughtaright, he has failed to share; failing to share means that he has not loved.Without love, no man should begin to teach. As God watches the growth of Hisuniverse, sharing with it His life, His wisdom and His joy, so must the teacher,meditating continually, sharing his vision and his wisdom with the pupil. As hesees his many pupils grow in earthly strength and grace, in mental gifts, inheavenly wisdom, he should pay close attention to the diversities of gifts andcharacter which each one develops as he grows; for only by close study and wisediscrimination can he select each one and place him in his natural group so thatclasses may be formed; for only those be so grouped whose gifts and characterdemand a similarity of method.One of the most difficult and important tasks of the teacher is the grouping ofthe pupils in their class. He should not group so much by age or subject to betaught as by innate character. When thus the proper groups are formed, theymaybe mingled or even interchanged, but in all that affects the close relationbetween the teacher and the taught, a proper grouping should be maintained. Soalso, in the world of thought and feeling; it is with the highest wisdom thatthe underlying bases of the teacher’s art should be applied. When the teacherimparts knowledge, he should at the same time show the pupil how he may acquirethat knowledge for himself. Thus it is that, when I lift you to the land of joyand make you free of all its wide domain, I show you also, how to open wide youreyes, that for yourself you may see; for this is the teacher’s way."},{"pageContent":"8 JOYI would sing to you of joy, the joy of the Gods as they revel in the land ofjoy.The land of joy is the land of dreams, where every dream comes true. Where everythought and answering thought thrills with joy.The land of joy is the land of the Gods, there lives the God in man;For men are Gods, and the Godly part dwells in the land of the Gods.The land of joy is beyond the mind, through the gates of eternal peace.Angels share that land with men, and these are the Gods who sing;Thrills of gladness fill the air, by joy we live and breathe;Everything there is full of joy, like the bursting buds of spring;Throughout all the land is the freshness of morn, of dew, of bud, of flower.Lightly the angels pass on their way, wafted on wings of joy;Nature wears a perennial smile, a smile that is ever new;Laughter rings through the woods and dells, for the joy of eternal spring.All power, all truth, all vision, all work, all life, is expressed in that landin terms of joy. An effort of will sends a wave of gladness through that land;new tasks are welcomed with the smile of those who greet their dearest friend.Every heart and every soul thrills with the dancing gladness of spring; vastchoirs of angels sing songs of joy. Cherubim and Seraphim disport themselves,their winged faces shining with joy. In that land every thought becomes a poem.The lower man must join the higher man in the land of joy; the twain must walktogether through its green places. The higher man iscalling, ever calling to thelower: “Come, come into the land of joy.” As his eyes are opened, splendour onsplendour is revealed. The fluting pipes of Seraphim, the treble songs ofCherubim—those twins sing and play in con- cert in the land of joy. No earthlyeyes can see, no earthly ears may hear, the vision and the music of this land;no earthly hand of lower man can ever truly write its wonder and beauty, itsecstasy and thrilling gladness. It is the land where every earthly happinessfinds birth; a single thrill within it gives birth unto a thousand happy hoursin the world below. Its wayside flowers are parents of earth’s most lusciousblooms; its trees, waving in the evening breeze, send divine melodies to thelower ears of men.Springlike freshness of air, lily-scented bowers, oceans wide like mightyfrosted panes, reflecting the noon-day sun, rivers of crystal, streamlets whosewaters are of precious stones, waterfalls and cataracts like broken sun-raysflashing through a thousand prisms, billowy foam, showers of spray of diamonds,each drop lighted with an inward sun, tall trees, like stately mothers of theGods emerald clad; clouds that are alive and gambol like the lambs as they floatacross a sky of sweeping vastness with ever changing hues, lighted as if by athousand sunsets; air balmy, buoyant and full of song like the trickling of arill, air of particles which constantly explode and shed bright radiance,vitality and all the fresh odours of spring—of such is the land of joy.It is a land of fair valleys, towering heights, vast chasms, great precipices,every rock and stone bejewelled with a thousand gems; earth that is pigmentreflecting the hues of the sky; each particle of earth a separate life, apulsing, heart-shaped diamond, translucent, yet full of colour and of light.Every shade that passes over the sky changes the colour of the earth, is brokento a thousand hues by myriads of nature’s prisms. There are no deserts there,yet all the land is like an oasis, a mirage that is true.In that land, so far and yet so near, the immortal self of man resides. Thereall day long he walks, companioned by his angel kin, each ensouled by joy, eachits embodiment. There distance is not, for all the world is at his feet; thereno time passes, for eternity is his. Such is the land wherein the souls of mendwell; such is man’s spiritual home.Though I speak of land, of river, sea and sky, of trees that wave majestically,of precipices and glade, of mountain-top and field, it is but the essence ofthese things, and not their form, which compose the varied landscape of the landof joy. For it is the land of light, where all things are of light; there is noform that you would recognise as form; yet form is known through cognizance ofthe essence of all form. Beauty gives ecstasy, the answering thrill of joy, yetit is not beauty’s form but beauty’s self we see. In this world of eternalgladness, there are no words, for the soul of men and angels have no need ofwords, nor are there thoughts, for thoughts are but divisions of ideas, as wordsare but divisions of thoughts. Here division cannot be, for the land of joy isunity made manifest, yet not in form.Unity is the basic law of the land of joy. All the knowledge that men acquire bythought is here, without the need of thought; all the deepest love they everfeel is here, universally shining, not from a centre or a part, but implicitthroughout. The music that you know by thought, by feeling and by sound is afaint and far off echo of its universal music. Before this music could find trueexpression in the lower worlds, every atom of the worlds of thought, of feelingand of flesh, would have to learn to sing, so that there would be no room at allfor anything save music; even the interstices between the particles which buildthe form would be filled with song. Before the lower man could hear the wondroussound, he must be built anew, of singing atoms, so that he could hear the atom’suniversal song. Yet, even then, for him the vision and the sound of the land ofjoy would be afar off; for in that land, thought, love, beauty and music are oneand indivisible, interchangeable, each instinct with the other; inseparable isthis four-fold life-force, yet one.Every human ideation in the lower worlds is here a living thing, completelycomprehended in a flash in all its possibilities, from birth to ultimateexpression and full maturity, and beyond that to the fading of the power, evento its death. Birth, maturity, death, here the three are known as one. In thisland where joy reigns, dwell the ideations of the universe; they are theessence, distilled drop by drop from the consciousness of God; here, theimmortal self of man sheds upon the lower man the odours of those preciousessences, the scents of those perfumes. As the lower man, in world of thought,breathes their delicious scent, a system of philosophy is born, a symphonyformed, a mighty flood of genius released.The creative fire which drives the artist on, is fed from the petals of theflowers from which these perfumes are distilled, for earthly flowers are but thesolid embodiment of universal ideations. In the land of joy there is but oneperfume—the essence of every odour of the world below, containing all. Angelsdescending to the lower worlds where heavenly joy will one day reign, bear intheir hands, censers, exhaling perfumes from above, and, as they fly, they swingthem, pervading the world of thought and feeling with their power. As thethinking and feeling selves of men breathe in the scented power, great deeds ofheroism and love are born in worlds of flesh. The mother clasps the babe moreclosely to her breast, ready to give her life for it, if need be; the slave ofhousework toiling with rebellious heart, seeing before her a life-time’sdrudgery, takes heart anew; sees husband tired, sees children sick, yet drudgeson. Round her the angels gather, and flood her with their perfume; rebellionpasses, peace comes, in the morning she wakes with courage all renewed, tocontinue the hourly heroism of her daily life. Of that heroism the angels sing,and the song is heard in the land of joy; and the immortal self smiles, knowingthat the time shall quickly come when the lower and the higher shall be one,knowing that his earthly pilgrimage shall yield most precious fruit, that hisearthly “son” shall come home, laden with gifts, gifts that will add newsplendour, new gladness and new power to the ecstasy by which he findsexpression in the land of joy.To every man and woman in every walk of life in the lower worlds, the angelscome, bearing their perfume, the aroma of eternal ecstasy. They would waken inthe hearts of every man, a craving for that scent, would give to men theknowledge that they have a heavenly home, would show them in the mirror of themind the reflection of their heavenly self—the vision of their own immortality.This is the mission, also, of every teacher among men, every preacher, healer,sage, artist, scientist, statesman and king. All have as their mission if theybut rightly understood it, to reveal to man his own inherent splendour, to leadhim through the sorrows of his earthly life back to his spiritual home, the landof joy."},{"pageContent":"9 VISIONAll labour should be performed in the light of vision, and none undertaken untilvision has been achieved. However well plans may be laid, they will fail unlessthey are based upon vision. Vision is relative, and a question of degrees. It isnot fixed, but changes as the minutes pass and must therefore be renewedconstantly. Vision is the contact of the small self with the great Self. It isthe knowledge of divine ideas.Before the birth of stars, before the growth of worlds, came vision—before allthings manifest and unmanifest is vision. Vision comes before the first act ofGod; it is the life of the unmanifest, and the world in which it dwells. Visionreveals the plan; is the essence of the real, that from which it sprang, andthat by which it grew, that by which its ultimate expression is achieved. Visionregulates the march of the spheres, guides the universe, rules the Cosmos;behind all the multitude of stars and worlds, throughout the infinities of spaceis vision. If you delve into the innermost heart of God, you will find Himseated in the midst of vision—vision which is the heart of the real; from Hisvision proceeds the real, and from the real the unreal.Vision passes to manifestation through the unmanifest, and if you would escapethe confines of the universe, seeking the Cosmos, searching for theAbsolute—what you will find is vision: so vast, so all-embracing, so infinite,that to you it will appear as darkness, darkness from which you will shrink; adarkness and a silence so profound as to exclude all possibility of light andsound, a stillness so absolute as to exclude the possibility of motion.Such is the vision of the Absolute. Your wings may not carry you across its widespaces; you cannot fall into its dark depths, your eyes cannot penetrate itsutter blackness, wings, eyes and voice serve you no longer, you must turnbackward, craving for sound and light and motion. Yet that which to you ispositive negation, is the vision from which all universes spring. Descend, then,once more, to your own world, finding there a reflection of the darkness you cancomprehend, for even as you gaze into its depths, vision will come, and you willknow all that has been, is, and is to be—the vision of the Now, that which isbehind eternity.No man possesses it, no ruler, even of systems or of worlds, can claim it fortheir own, since they themselves are but the shadows appearing within its darkdepths. Yet it is not evanescent, nor aerial, nor ethereal, nor does it everchange; IT IS.The highest point within you is but a reflection of that vision; every cell inevery world is ordered by it. You and I and all that live are ordered by thatvision in our enfolding and unfolding. It is not God, for God Himself, whetherHe be man, angel, world, or ruler of worlds, or even ruler of rulers of worlds,must conform to it. Whence it came is not known, nor ever could be known, for itis behind all knowledge, even of the Supreme. It is at once apex and base, andsides of the pyramid of all things manifest and unmanifest. When men, angels,worlds, and rulers of worlds, pass from manifestation to the unmanifest again,vision remains; nor is it changed in its varying decrees.So, my brothers, in all things let us seek the vision. Whenever our eyes restupon a form, let us seek its vision; and when we hear a sound, or see a light,or grasp an idea, or even for a brief space touch reality, let us remember thatbehind all these there is vision, and, remembering, bend our powers withtireless search, to find it; since when it is found, the key of knowledge isrevealed. It is not here, nor there, nor anywhere, but everywhere. When you gazeon beauty, you gaze upon the Self, and when you gaze upon the Self you seeyourself; and behind the greater and the lesser selves is vision. The visionthat you have, the dreams of future lives, the splendour of great plans, theinward urge to tread the path, to find the goal, the craving of your hearts tomake a perfect world, to heal the sick, to appease all pain, to annihilate theignorance of man—the vision of all this in you, in a faint reflection of thevision seen by That which is the summation of all that is. For behind That toois vision.There is a graded order, including all visions, great and small. Remember this,and ever seek to test your own small share, raising it stage by stage throughthe graded orders which lead from the unreal to the real, and from the real tovision. Just as no vision you can have is comparable to that of the ruler ofyour worlds, so is His vision not to be compared with that from which itsprings. In all your lives, in all the worlds, seek vision. Behind the atom andthe gem, behind the growing plant and mighty tree, behind the fawn, the lion andthe tiger too, behind the angel and the man, behind archangels and SolarLords—is vision; until you have found it your soul will not find rest. Sight,even mental sight, is to it as the ideas of a world to the infinitude ofideations behind all worlds. Yet sight is the instrument by which it may beknown; for there is a graded order of sight, a stairway of vision, winding in anever- ending spiral through all worlds and through all space; somewhere, on onestep of that infinitely splendid spiral way is physical sight; next above ismental sight, the vision of the mind, and, beyond that, spiritual sight, whichleads to universal sight and thence to Cosmic sight and, beyond that, unknownsight—unknown save that there is no end, that somewhere in that unknowninfinitude the highest and the lowest meet. There is nought separating thehighest sight from the lowest, nor are they different save as they showthemselves in each individual soul.This is the starting point for every quest, that, inasmuch as it can show itselfthrough us, everything is ours; for within man too, that mighty spiral can befound, not of him, but passing through him, winding its way from below, enteringhis feet, as it were, and winding through him till it passes out above his headinto his deeper self. Through all things these spirals pass, up them all thingsmust climb within themselves. These lesser spirals are, to the mighty curves ofthe Cosmic stairs, as are its circular reflections to the rainbow— not therainbow itself, but expressions of its light. Behind the lesser and the greatercurves is vision—vision of the spiral whole."},{"pageContent":"10 THOROUGHNESSIf you find and tread this pathway, see that everything you do is done withthoroughness and efficiency. Absence of thoroughness is a denial of divinity. Asdivinity is implicit throughout the universe, so should thoroughness be implicitthroughout your work. Set a standard for yourselves. Absence of thoroughnessmeans loss of force, since without it no work can be clear-cut in its outlines,finished in its expression. Work should be regarded as a vessel containingforce; the force of the idea behind it. Thoroughness gives to the vessel aperfect outline. Where the outline of a form is perfect, there is no loss offorce. Work should be regarded as a chalice held up to the mind, that throughthe mind, the power of the idea of which the work is the ultimate expression,may descend into it. If the work is not thorough, the chalice will be malformed,the wine spilled; therefore work always with thoroughness. So God worksthroughout His universe, in which there is not even the smallest part which doesnot bear the impress of His mind. Nothing, however minutely small, isoverlooked; nothing, however great, that is not completely pervaded by and heldwithin the grasp of His mind. He makes of His universe a perfect chalice. UnderHis control no force is ever wasted. The cup of His work, full to overflowing,never overflows. So also His ministers work, the dual hierarchies of archangelsand perfected saints, His Holy Ones, His right hand and His left.The only ideal for which man may worthily strive is that of joining the rank ofthe ministers of God, whether of human or of angel kind. That ideal can only beachieved by successful imitation of Their methods. The keynote of Their work isthoroughness; let it be the keynote of yours. Without it the highest cannot beachieved. If your work concerns the details of life, work with infinitelycareful attention to detail; if you deal in broader outlines, in wider sweeps,plan with an equal thoroughness. Thus will your work embody the power of theidea upon which it is based; thus you will achieve success.It is essential that the idea should be true, that is, an expression of thedivine idea. Then it will be a source of power, and will give a power, a dynamicenergy to the work which is its ultimate expression, raising it to heightsworthy of a worker who aspires to serve as the hand of God. The idea representsthe head; the worker, the hand of God.On this conception base all your work. Thus you will achieve greatness, thus youwill live according to the highest, thus truth will be yours, thus you willenter the land of joy, ever to live therein, for joy and work are synonyms inthe land of joy. There is no joy without work; all work is joy; therefore, mybrothers, when you work, remember joy. Try to make of your world a reproductionof the land of joy. Keep joy uppermost; flood your house with joy, your garden,too. Let joyousness pervade your neighbourhood. Preach, teach, inculcate joy,set it upon high, hold it up before the eyes of men, become yourselves itsembodiments. Thus will you bring the sense of the land of joy even to theearthly hearts and minds of men.Cease to divide your world and work into compartments; train yourselves to seein every- thing an expression of the One. Practise the discovery of synonyms,play at matching them. Do not pass from work to play, from play to prayer, fromprayer to worship in your Church, from Church to recreation; do all things asfrom a centre from which they are seen as one, as indeed they truly are. Thuswill you give a new meaning to life. Above all things else this is the need ofyour race.You have lost the sense of unity; you are conquered by the delusion ofdiversity; you are enslaved by the apparent separateness of things. So you havelost the meaning and the true vision of life. That vision must be recoveredbefore any advance can be achieved. The keynote of the true vision of themeaning of life is unity in diversity; therefore, you must also teach unity.Unity is the most intangible of all the attributes. Seek to grasp it in thelower world and it will evade you; therefore, you must rise above diversity,beyond form, past ideas, even leaving the land of joy behind you since joy is anidea. When the last vestige of an idea has been emptied from your soul, unitycan be found."},{"pageContent":"11 UNITYAs there is a land of joy, so also there is a world where diversity is not,where there is unity alone. It is higher than the land of joy, for joy is theland of universal ideas, and unity is behind ideas. You cannot speak with anytruth about this land, for words are diversities. Therefore may that land benamed by one word alone; it is the land of unity. Not only is there no need forother words, there are no other words, for the one word “unity” expresses thewhole. To analyse is to lose it; to synthesise is to lose it; unity cannot beanalysed or synthesised; it is one.What use, then, in the lower worlds? This, that you should obtain the flavour ofit. The flavour of unity can be tasted by the mind, can even be expressed inaction as mutual endeavour. Wherever there is mutual endeavour in the lowerworlds, there men have caught the flavour of unity. In the higher worlds, abovethe mind, nought else exists, for they are closer to the world of unity; unityis their very life. Of it, perhaps, one sentence may be truly said; it is theembodiment of the will of God. Of that resistless will, no man living in thelower worlds may know. That it brought all things forth, that it holds allthings in existence, that is the driving power behind all life—these may beknown; but they are its attributes and not the will Itself; by will a man mustrise through thought, through the land of ideas, even through unity, to the verySelf. Then he may know the will of God.This is a road which every man may take immediately, a road which one day everyman will take irrevocably. If he would shorten his sojourn in the worlds ofform, if his soul is satiated of form and separateness, then let him return: lethim set forth upon the road by which he came, the ancient road, the well- wornroad, the road which so many of his race and ours have trodden. This road is athis feet; let him set them thereon. It passes through his heart; he must paytoll with his heart’s blood. It leads through his mind; he must be ready to layaside his mind. Then he will find the bridge, the bridge so difficult to cross,for the way is very narrow here, but every step he takes widens it.Upon the approaches to the bridge the human race is standing today.The next stage in the evolution of the human mind will lead to the crossing ofthe bridge; it leads from the concrete to the abstract, from thought to idea,from separateness to union, from form to formlessness, from the impermanent tothe permanent, from the mortal to the immortal, from the illusory to the actual,from the temporal to the eternal, from that which dies to that which is undying,from the natural man to the spiritual man, from the Not-Self to the Self. It isthe bridge which all saints have crossed; it is the dividing line between spiritand mind. It is not a place; it is a state; it is not external; it is within.After the bridge has been crossed, places disappear; only states ofconsciousness remain. He who would cross must leave himself behind; first,because no separated self can enter the state of union with the One; second,because the self must remain in lower worlds, as messenger and ambassadorbetween the two lands on either side of the bridge. Having paid toll with theblood of the heart, having made ready to lay his mind aside, let the bravepilgrim step boldly on to the bridge; immediately he will find himself on thefurther side.The bridge will not bear him standing; only as he moves across it may he makeuse of its support. Having crossed, he finds himself in the land of joy, wherepain is forever left behind, where parting is unknown, where knowledge dwells.He has reached the first resting place. Here he will find peace; here he willrenew his courage and his strength, for the succeeding stages of his pilgrimage;here he will survey the road along which he has passed; here past and presentwill become one; here he may estimate the future and collect the many streams ofenergy that he has liberated in the past, and bind them into one. He will nowbegin to direct this single stream of power; he will float no longer upon itswaves, at the mercy of the current, henceforth he will take control of himself.Knowing the past, he will possess the future. Here he will gather together theproducts of his many lives; and will assess their value; here, he will balancecausation and effect; here, he begins to be the ruler of them both, knowing themas one; here, he sums up into a whole the zodiacal experiences of his manylives.Thus, having crossed the bridge, will he live, thus will he labour, knowing hislower self (the man that he has left behind in worlds of form below the bridge)as his instrument. As instrument, henceforth, he must employ the lower man; uponmind, feeling and body he must play at will, render them silent at will, deprivethem of all self-initiated volition, teach them to answer to his gentlestthought, develop to the full their automatism, so that they labour in the worldsof form as perfectly as if he himself employed them.That portion of himself which he sent down, clothing it in form that it mightcommand form, he now withdraws, leaving the form bereft of self, nought but aninstrument. Later, he will withdraw still further; thus it is of very greatimportance that from the outset the form should be controlled, perfected,trained, ready to be laid aside at will, according to his need of freedom in thehigher worlds, ready to be resumed and to serve with absolute efficiency. Thisis his duty in the world of form.He will do his work with ease, because henceforth he works from above. No longeris a stream of thought or a rising feeling, or a craving of the flesh,associated with himself. He knows them as the not-self, repudiates their claims,and rules thought, feeling and flesh with his liberated will. They are but thebrush with which he paints, in lower worlds, the vision which is his in worldsbeyond the bridge. As pencil, he sharpens them, that he may draw truly thepattern he will weave upon the web of time and space, those illusory rulers ofthe worlds below.These are the lessons he must learn ere once more he can take the road by whichhe shall attain liberation from the domain of time, space and form. He takes hisbodies one by one, and perfects them, as a mechanic sharpens and adjusts histools, that they may give him perfect service, never failing him in any task towhich he sets his hand. The body must be made pure, light, responsive, accurateand controlled; it must be at ease. Through every nerve, sinew and muscle,through every organ, through flesh and skin and bone, there must be ease—perfectpoise—utter restfulness. He must preserve his vital force as his most preciousjewel in the lower world. Without it, the finest body will be useless; with it,all things may be done. It is the life force of the form through which hehimself is immanent.He will only use that portion of his body which the immediate task demands; theremainder will be at rest, acting as a reservoir of vital force. Thus will hegain health, thus develop the special kind of strength which he will need inorder to manifest, through the form which he maintains in worlds below, thevision and the power which he has won beyond the bridge. Thus will the pencilpoint be sharp, thus will he ensure against error, through failure, of theinstrument.This work will not be new, for, having glimpsed the vision of the land beyondthe bridge for many lives before he crossed it, he has been preparing himselfwith such knowledge and power as he could command, while imprisoned in the lowerworlds. His real, immortal self, with whom he is now united and identified,influenced him continually by brooding and suggestion, by atmosphere, by visionand by dream, so that he might prepare.His feelings and thoughts he cultivates and refines, making them responsive onlyto the higher, eliminating all that which could respond to the lower. Havingthus erected and perfected the downward pointing pyramid, he proceeds to thedecoration and perfection of the higher, so that he may be ready for the nextstage of the journey.Thus, and thus alone, may lower man, in lower worlds, become regenerate. This isthe meaning of the new birth. Man must die to his lower self in order that hemay find new birth in the higher. As in earthly death, he finds rebirth into theworlds of feeling and of thought, so in this withdrawal of himself from thesovereignty of form, he may be said to die. He is not laid in any grave, nordoes his body disappear before the eyes of men, yet he truly dies. This is themeaning of the crucifixion—the death, essential to birth. Every man must treadthe road the Saviour trod.There is a cyclic order in this birth and death. The crucifixion at the end ofone cycle, leads to birth at the commencement of the next. In never-endingspirals the great drama must be repeated, man ascending ever higher as he enactsthat drama. It may well be called a crucifixion, for death upon the cross ofmaterial worlds must be repeated day by day, hour by hour, minute by minute, byhim who would tread the Path.Let no man think that he can hide behind a text, or take one step upon thosespiral stairs by trusting in the sorrows of another, however great. It is thisdelusion which has delayed the progress of the western world: that by thesuffering of another, his sins, however he indulge, may be forgotten; that bybathing in another’s blood he can find the feet of God. Such teachings may bringcomfort to the mass, for behind them there is a truth, however much distorted;but he who would truly save the mass must leave the mass behind; relying on thestrength of his inherent divinity alone, he must find and tread the path.When the great resolve is once born within his heart, when once the first stephas been taken, the help of many Saviours will be his, and with him They willfreely share Their blood. This is the true Atonement, the at-one-ment which oneday he must learn. They, the Liberated Men, the Great Ones of the earth; theperfected saints, the Holy Ones of God; theGuides and Masters of great hosts of angels; the Hidden Rulers of the world; thenever- sleeping Watchers; They, Whose hands are never tired yet are ever full oflabour for the world; Whose eyes are filled with pity, power and love, andinfinite compassion— They stand, order upon order, living in realms beyond theland of peace and joy, resting in perfect unity with Him from Whom They sprang.They and Their angel hosts welcome the pilgrim; They send him strength, andcheer and comfort in his trials; They lend him angels to guide him on the Path.They smile upon his every fall, knowing that Their own achievements grew largelyfrom their falls; They hide his eyes from the radiance of his own successes lestpride should rob him of humility. If from Their splendid heights, it werepossible that They could feel a touch of fear, that fear would be for him who,essaying the path, has not yet died to pride.Aided by the light from These, his great fore-runners, having cast off ignoranceand the superstition of the mass, strong in the strength of his divinity, thepilgrim climbs the hill, learning continually to die, voluntarily crucifyinghimself in worlds of form, that he may be born in formless worlds. He mortifieshis flesh, but not in hermit’s cave nor monkish cell, not by the scourge orshirt of hair, not by penances that destroy the fair beauty of the flesh; hemortifies himself by mind and will; his asceticism is of self-restraint ineverything; his penance is the sacrifice of everything which would hinder hisprogress on the path; yet he knows no torture, and seldom, in his early days,anguish of soul.Though thus he dies continually, and suffers all the pangs of death, he is notmiserable. He is filled with joy, for he knows that every pang he feels, thatevery nail or spear that pierces him, liberates more power. As, from his wounds,his blood flows down upon the world below, more blood flows in.Thus he learns to know the mystery of the wounded hands and feet and side. Heknows that only when his hands are pierced with nails can he reach out and savethe world;that only when his body is bowed beneath the cross can he bear its weight, andtread its road; only when he wears the crown of thorns can the kingly poweremanate from him; he knows that only when his side is pierced, only when thesoldier’s spear (symbolical of strife and separateness and pain) has opened hisheart, can he pay toll that he may pass along the road; that having given of hislife’s blood, he draws ever nearer to the land of joy where strife andseparateness and pain can touch him no more, and, in the very act of giving, hehears the echo of the angels’ voices singing in that land. Through his darknessand his pain, there comes a gleam of light, as from a candle burning in thewindow of his spiritual home.So, ever, as he dies, is crucified in the worlds of form, men marvel at hisfortitude; that even while he suffers, he smiles; that even in the darkness ofhis agony, his eyes are bright. Men do not, cannot, know that he hears the musicand sees the vision of the higher world, and that, by this music and joy, hiswoe is overcome. Though the path is called the path of woe, it also may becalled the path of joy. This should be added: that the joy is greater than thewoe, the peace greater than the strife, the growing power greater than theweariness of pain, the light greater than the darkness. The moon it is whichsets, but already upon his face are the first gleams of the rising sun.Thus have I tried to tell the story of immortal man, who voluntarily submittedto the imprisonment of form, the deadening weight of flesh, that he might learnto master form and flesh. Having endured imprisonment of flesh for many lives,through many centuries, he now seeks to harvest all his gains. To do this hemust disentangle his immortal part from the mortality which it wore, he mustchange the habit of a thousand lives and free himself from form. The Saviournamed him Prodigal.So he treads the path, seeking ever to beautify, to cultivate and refine hisvehicles, his instruments, that, after he has died to them and died to theircontrol, and won his birth in other worlds, he may use and find in them amany-sided diamond, which he may render still more highly polished, whose manyfacets he may now perfect, that through its translucent beauty, the new glorywhich is his may shine forth for the helping of his fellow-men. Such is hisattitude to body and to form; ever he regards them as matter to be perfected andbeautified.This is the picture of his inner and his outer growth. Within he treads thepath, finds the bridge that leads him from the mind, crosses it, and isidentified with that of which he is a fragment and knows himself as anincarnated part, a separated gleam of light, from worlds of light, illuminatinga portion of the world below. That part has now become the whole, that beam hasbeen withdrawn into the parent light. The outer labour of the pilgrim on thepath consists of polishing the matter which he has worn since, as a separatedpart, he came forth, of imparting to it a perfect translucency.This is the meaning of spiritual death and spiritual birth. It is not a death asman would reckon death, for the form remains, apparently it lives and breathes.Symbolically, he truly dies, for he withdraws himself from form. Between thedeath which men call death and the death symbolical, there is this difference:that in the death of mortal flesh, the flesh disintegrates, while in the deathsymbolical, it is still preserved. This death refers more to the power of theform, and its control of life; to that he truly dies. In mortal death there is amoment when men can say “he lives,” a moment when men say “he dies,” a momentwhen men say “he is dead.” But in the death of him who is reborn, death iscontinuous. This is a mystery which only he who treads the path can solve. Ifyou would understand it, seek the road."},{"pageContent":"12 THE PATHWhat reasons may be given to him who asks: “Why should I tread the Path of Woe?”There is but one reason, but it is all sufficient—for love’s sake. For it islove which brings about the first murmurings of discontent within the heart ofman.The value of his pilgrimage, the estimation of its worth, these may becalculated in terms of power to love. There comes a time in the long series ofhis many lives, when love demands an answer and assumes control, when mansurrenders to the power of love. Love floods his being, fills his heart, findsan entrance into every nook and cranny of his soul. In him love’s self becomesincarnate. Therefore, he can no longer deny love. Thus, filled with love, helooks upon the world with its eyes, sees the whole of manifested life in noother terms. Being himself filled with love, he sees in all things an expressionof love. Love is his cosmos, love is his Self. Thus illumined, thus suffused, hesees the sorrows and suffering of the world, he hears the cry of every soul inpain, the tears of sorrow fall upon his heart and burn like drops of liquidflame.The birds, the beasts, the fishes of the sea, find entrance to his heart; hefeels their anguish as they die, slaughtered, butchered by those who know notlove. Seeing all this, feeling it deep within his soul, he rises up to save, andfinds that he is powerless, that he cannot stay the hand of cruelty, he cannotheal the gaping wound. He has neither the knowledge nor the power to take awaythe agonies of animals and men which tear his heart. Then conscious of hisimpotence, so great is the anguish of his soul, that the resolve that he willachieve both knowledge and power is born.Thus it is he finds and sets his feet upon the path. If he ever should falter,love drives him on; if, in his weakness, he turns back, love bars the way; if hewould stray down the pleasant by-ways of self-delusion and self-indulgence, loveturns him back. If, with dead arguments and lifeless theories, philosophers bidhim stay, if they would close his ears to cries of pain, love sounds her mightytrumpet driving away harsh theories and philosophies, burns within him sofiercely that he can rest no more. If ever, while he walks, he deludes himselfwith dreams, love awakens his soul, shatters his dreams; demands action. Shouldhe stumble, love sustains him; at every milestone love smiles on him, takingstronger hold upon his heart.Early upon the path, he finds that in the near approach of love are knowledgeand power. He stretches forth his hand to help and sees the wound heal. Filledwith a new joy, the joy of love expressed, he journeys on. Should one ask of himthe reason of his pain, the reason is revealed by love. Thus knowledge grows,the knowledge of the cause of human woe. Then it is he hears love speak:“Knowledge and power must be wedded within you ere you can heal the sorrows ofthe world.”Thus love puts into his hands the standard he must bear, and writes the name ofGod upon it. Men see him as he passes on his way, they see the standard in hishand, but striving to read the Name, they see only power, knowledge, love. Theycannot read the Name of God; they only see the armour, the sword and the shieldwhich God lends to His son who journeys home.Thus armed and equipped he crosses the bridge; hears the angels’ welcomingsongs; finds the source of knowledge, power and love; drinks his fill of theseand, being filled, knows himself divine. Godlike in his knowledge, power andlove, he turns to heal and save the world which he has left behind. There is nopain which does not answer to the magic of his touch, no thirst that cannot beassuaged by his power, no evil that his knowledge cannot dissipate, no form oflife, however high or low, in which he cannot see himself. He heals byidentification. He drives away pain because he is pain’s self, because pain isbut the darker side of joy; being joy, he also is pain.By leaving the world of men, he becomes their redeemer. This is his prize; thisthe goal; for this he started out upon the path. In the act of redeeming, heknows the greatest of all joys—the joy of love completely expressed.You who read, have you not felt within your hearts the sorrows of the world?Have its cries of woe hurt your heart or do you still sleep? You may sleep for awhile, but the time will come when love will take you by the hand and set yourfeet upon the path. It is because of this that I have come, speaking in the nameof your angel self, seeking to show you the road, to tell you of its splendour,of the glories yet to be revealed. Your own soul will awaken you to knowledge ofyour own divinity, you will arise and make of your earthly self a temple whichshall be a worthy dwelling-place for your other self, the Self which is divine.The shrine of that temple must be within your heart; within that shrine, theChrist in you must come to dwell. For this reason, see to it that the temple ofyour body, the vehicle of your life, be beautiful, that through its beauty thesplendour of the God within may be revealed."},{"pageContent":"13 METHODS OF INVOCATIONThe ceremonies consist of a morning invocation to the Angels and an eveningservice of thanksgiving.For this purpose the following suggestions are made: a shrine, in or out ofdoors, should be set apart and, where possible, used exclusively for thispurpose; it should be consecrated by an appropriate ceremonial, which would haveas its object the invocation of the power of the angels and the establishment ofa centre and atmosphere in which contact and cooperation would be possible. Theinitial ceremony could be performed by a priest of the religion of the country,who is sympathetic to the ideals expressed, or by an occultist possessing thenecessary knowledge and power.In the east, should be an altar upon which worshippers should place (a) fragrantflowers, gathered freshly each day, (b) religious symbols, (c) a picture orstatue of the Founder of the religion, (d) holy water, (e) incense, and (f)candles. The minimum—where other things are unobtainable—would be flowers and asingle object of beauty.Essential conditions are complete cleanliness, an atmosphere of utter purity,and a single desire for mutual cooperation of angels and men for the helping ofthe world.Joy, simplicity and beauty should characterise all the ceremonies, preparationsand arrangements.All participants in the ceremonies should be clothed in simple robes of colourcorresponding to that of the group of angels whose aid is being invoked; allundergarments should be white. One of the participants should officiate and actas link between the two corresponding groups of angels and men. GROUPS OF ANGELSCOLOURS TO BE WORNGuardian angels of the home...

Where more than one group ofangels is invoked, the officiant for each should be robed in the appropriatecolour and perform the appropriate ceremony.PROCEDURE. Once begun the services should be maintained regularly and are bestperformed immediately after the morning and evening ablutions. The presence ofchildren—who should wear white—is desirable.All should enter in procession, the children leading, the officiants last.The children should sit in a half-circle, facing the altar, in front of theelders, leaving a passage in the centre for the officiants.Where very young, aged, sick people or pregnant women are present, they shouldbe placed nearest the altar, the rest, with the exception of children, standingin straight rows behind them.Each officiant, one for each group of angels, will advance to the altar in turn,repeat the appropriate invocation, during which he will lift the bowl of flowersabove his head, following them with his eyes. When taking his special part inthe ceremony the officiant should use all his powers of thought and will tosummon the angels. (The measure of effectiveness in all ceremony isproportionate to the amount of knowledge, will and thought- power employed bythe officiant.)All present will join with him, to the utmost of their capacity, followingintently the meaning of the prayer.No undue physical strain should be produced by the effort made, but ceremoniesshould not be allowed to degenerate into mere repetition of formulas. At thesame time, an intense feeling of joy in, and a sense of anticipation of, thecompanionship of the angels must be steadily maintained.At the evening service of thanksgiving, after the prayer, let the officiant holdup the bowl of flowers, offering their beauty and their sweetness to the angels,and pouring through them deep love and gratitude from his heart towards theangel hosts. Let all present similarly pour out their love through the officiantand the flowers; then sit in silence, giving thanks and making their privateprayers; then go direct to bed.When it is not possible for the young, the sick, the aged or the pregnant to bepresent, the group or a part of the group should go straight to their room fromthe shrine, bear- ing a second bowl of flowers, which has been standing on thealtar during the ceremony.Then, facing the patient, the particular ceremony required should berepeated—invoking angel guardians for the young and aged, building angels forthe pregnant, healing angels for the sick. Where only one room is thus visited,the bowl of flowers should be left on a small shrine in the room; where a numberof visits are called for, the flowers should be distributed among the rooms,placed in vases on the respective shrines. Where an appropriate object of beautycannot be procured for these shrines, flowers will suffice.At risk of repetition it should be made clear that this conception must bepreserved in its simplest possible form, entirely free from all sensationalismor elaborate ceremonial; nor should any attempt be made to obtain close personalcontact with individual angels, or to employ them from motives of personal gain,interest or curiosity. Such endeavours would almost invariably lead to disaster,and must be rigorously avoided. It should be as natural to work with angels aswith human beings, or as with domestic animals; and qualities of SIMPLICITY,PURITY, DIRECTNESS and IMPERSONALITY must characterise all who wouldsuccessfully take part in such endeavours.A knowledge and appreciation of the teachings of the Ancient Wisdom should makedepression and similar moods impossible. Complete confidence in the Divine powerand Divine justice characterise the angel hosts, and if men would work with themthey, too, must attain those qualities. The ability to judge the importance of atemporary circumstance by seeing its relation to the whole, to the completedscheme, must be developed, so that it becomes impossible to be unduly elated,cast down, or overcome by any particular event or succession of events. Thepower to work on, with utter faith, with complete certainty, in spite of theapparent failure of any particular endeavour, must be sought; for thus theangels work. Christians would do well to remember and repeat frequently theCollect for the day of St. Michael and All Angels.Let me picture to you what may still come, give you a vision of that which liesahead.Picture a vast plain, in a far clime, under a clear sky, where thousands andthousands of your people gather—and, with them, the sick, the aged, theyoung—and form, in great figures on the plain, stars, triangles, pentagons,invoking us, until, descending to your earth, we come, visible, as robed inflesh—a glorious descent into your midst.
