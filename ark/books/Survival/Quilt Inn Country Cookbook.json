[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"The Quilt Inn Country Cookbook Introduction The Quilt Inn Country Cookbook was written as an invitation for you to join us at The Quilt Inn, to savor not only the joy of bountiful down-home cooking, but to drink in the pleasures of country inn living. We are itinerant travellers and country inn lovers, and we have selected and savored the best recipes of all the ones that we have tried, to crea te the essence of “inn-ness” for yo u. We’ve collected our favorite dishes, and memories, and spread them out for you here on our harvest table for you to sample and enjoy. Whe n you re-create these recipes for yourself, and as the homey smells of country cooking waft through your own kitchen, we hope you will be transported to The Quilt Inn where a warm welcome awaits you. People often ask us where The Quilt Inn is located, and when then can come visit us. The Quilt Inn is that mythic sort of place, like Camelot, that rises unexpectedly and fortuitously at the end of a long day to give haven to the weary traveller. We’ve all been to The Quilt Inn, if only in our hearts. The Quilt Inn is old and cozy, just like one of Grandma’s beloved and faded quilts it was named for. Whenever we are weary and bleary-eyed we can wrap it around us, and sink into its warmth. In Spring, we find the Inn in a cozy valley blanketed with snowy white cherry and peach blossoms. In Summer, we find it perched atop a breezy hill where the verdant treetops rustle like yards of crisp taffeta swooshing overhead. In Autumn, we find it at the end of a long narrow lane bordered by rows of trees in riotous colored patchwork. In W inter, we find it etched sharply in delicate filigrees of ice as our footsteps crunch noisily across the big snowy fields toward a wisp of smoke and warmth. It is everywhere different, and everywhere the same. It is the best of welcoming places. Welcome to The Quilt Inn."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The Quilt Inn Country Cookbook Aliske Webb © Aliske Webb 1999. All rights reserved. Published by Bookmice.com Everybody’s From Somewhere As Michael and I travelled around the country collecting stories for our memories and recipes for the Inn, we’ve enjoyed visiting small towns everywhere. I avoid highways whenever possible and go out of my way to find the “grey roads” on the map. They are the old roads, that lead meandering routes from town to town, left behind by the “red” and important superhighways. I often get us lost, but even that’s OK. Getting lost can lead you to some place more interesting than where you were heading. Strange, that. A wise man said, “ When you are on a trip and your destination seems to move further and further away , you know that it was the journey you were after, not the destination.” Early on we noticed that almost every town we visited had a sign at the town limits proudly boasting a native son or daughter who had gone on to fame and fortune, supposedly elsewhere. Now we’re on the lookout for those wonderful telltale signs. I think we’ve found the h ome of every Miss America since 1957. We found football, basketball and baseball stars who made it past local high school hero to world class competitor. We found singers and musicians who probably drove the neighbors crazy, were the ne’r-do-wells at the time, probably now laughing, and strumming, all the way to the bank. In the “ Who’s Who” of towns, (or perhaps that should be the “ Where’s Where”), is there a pecking order of luminaries? If your town can brag only of a Regional Lawn Bowling Champion, are you less of an address than a town strutting a Miss America or a Hall of Famer? It’s a comfortable reminder that everybody is from somewhere. And driving around any somebody’s home town lets us see a glimpse of their past and perhaps their burning motivation for achieving success elsewhere. We wonder how those home towns far e in the memories of native sons and daughters. Happy nostalgia of childhood? Or, couldn’t wait to leave nightmares. All those towns are everywhere different and everywhere the same. They are towns wi thout pity, towns from hell, or even towns with no name (Clint Eastwood"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The Quilt Inn Country Cookbook Aliske Webb © Aliske Webb 1999.

And eve ry town has the same sides. Every town has its uptown, downtown Saturday night. Its ever musical east side, west side. Everywhere you find stray cats roaming the alleys. Inevitably some good old boy is headed for the cheating s ide of town, while someone else is coming back from Heartache Avenue to the lonely side of town. There’s the seamy side of town, where Skid Row is, at the end of a dead end street. You may see uptown girls waiting for their downtown men. There are girls from the bad side of town, standing underneath the lamp post, and boys from the wrong side of the tracks, having back street affairs. That’s a lotta sides for one town. You may have arrived there at the bus stop on the mean streets or at a liveried abode on Easy street. You may have taken the straight and narrow or th e long and winding road. Or even the Yellow Brick Road. You may have been lead down the primrose path or taken the road less travelled to the crossroad where fates are decided. If you’re street smart, take the streeetcar named “Desire” back to the street where you live on the sunny side of the street. Wherever we journey away to, there are always blue highways that lead you to the back roads by the rivers of your memories, ever smiling, ever gentle, on your mind.

Published by Bookmice.com Swing Time On warm lazy afternoons I like to take a cool drink and lie in the hammock. It’s located in the middle of the front lawn, so it’s far enough away from the porch that no one can easily talk to you and disturb your reveries yet close enough to be summoned if necessary. Michael has learned that it requires a three alarm fire to warrant calling me out of the hammock. It’s a place I need to go when I'm mad at him for some reason or other. As Goethe said, “In a good marriage we become the guardians of each other’s solitude.” The hammock came to live with us from Mexico. It used to b e gaudy Fiesta- colored, but it’s toned down somewhat and mellowed a lot since and I believe it’s trying to approach a respectable earth-toned appearance in order to fit into our de cor. It’s slung between two huge century trees, Centurion trees. One willow. The other, oak. When the trees were originally and symbolically planted in the farmyard they were appealingly close together. Now that they are monster trees they are far too close together and make an odd coupling. The bent over willow symbolizes flexibility and change, with its long, slender, s upple leaves that swish softly in the wind, it stands beside the starchy, upright oak with its broad stiff leaves that rustle crisply and irritably, and symbolizes strength and stability. These are trees t hat speak two different leaf languages. Yet like yin and yang, they are opposites that complement and complete each other into a wholeness. Their branches intertwine bizarrely. The willow seems to flow into the oak’s stiff embrace, like an oddly coupled marriage. An artificially arranged marriage at that. Yet here the y are, generations later, still standing side by side, rooted and symbiotic. They’ve grown around each other, accommodated each other. Given each other space to grow. If one were to be cut down now, there would be spaces among the remaining one’s branches, like an empty embrace. Yes, just like a marriage. And he re I lie swinging between the two trees. Sometimes I am a willow. Sometimes I am oak."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The Quilt Inn Country Cookbook Aliske Webb © Aliske Webb 1999. All rights reserved.

Published by Bookmice.com Bandits at Four O’Clock One of the great things about Inn life is you get to rise early in the morning when it’s peaceful, cool and dark, to prepare breakfast for the guests. Great if your a robin, not so great if you’re an owl. And four o’clock is earlier than anyone who needs to get up. That’s the time when the banging and clattering started in the garden shed, behind the “Summer kitchen.” The Summer kitchen is a later wood frame addition to the original stone house. A Summer kitchen was used, as the name implies, during the Summer when it was hot, so that the cooking stoves wouldn’t heat up an otherwise cool house. It was also where the women put up preserves and processed all the garden produce for the Winter. I can’t imagine how uncomfortable it must have been when they were cooking and canning during the hot, hot days of Summer, before air conditioning or even electric fans. The original small wood door has now been enlarged into an archway that connects it directly to the main kitchen. The shed that is attached to the Summer kitchen is accessible only from the outside, but the hollow wood walls boom loudly with the echoes from the banging within. Back in the city, night noises like this would have panicked me. But here I know tha t whatever is making the noise is probably more afraid of me than I am of it. Probably rightly so. Humankind has done more damage to nature than nature has ever done to us. So, I pulled on a sweater and crept quietly to the kitchen and rummaged in the “junk drawer” for a flashlight. The steps were cold and wet beneath my bare feet but I never care about that when I’m hunting out my friends. As I creaked open the shed door and shone the light around inside, scurri ed rustlings behind the wheelbarrow revealed my quarry. A small pointy face stared back at me. Then two, three, four more culprits popped into view. Caught red-handed, four black-masked bandits were stuffing themselves with bird seed that Michael forgot to store in a metal storage bin. Momma raccoon had returned, with three babies this year. She’s never quite comfortable with humans, not like city park raccoons and I don’t want to tame her."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The Quilt Inn Country Cookbook Aliske Webb © Aliske Webb 1999. All rights reserved. Published by Bookmice.com That’s to o dangerous for her and her babies. She’s better off wild and fearful of humans. Momma raccoon has only three legs. I often wonder what happened to her. A fight with a farmyard dog maybe or caught in a trap, or whatever. She’s a tough old survivor. I left the shed door open and backed off a dozen feet so that I could watch them. That way, they would continue foraging in comfort. After a few minutes, Momma ambled unconcerned out the door and the three kits tumbled after her in a panic. She walked off thir ty feet or so and sat down, and looked back. All her babies were there behind her. She looked at me, stroked her whiskers as if to say, “Thanks for the breakfast!” and then rubbed her ear in farewell. Off they went back into the darkness. Back in bed with my ice cold feet, Michael opened his eyes, looked at me and shook his head smiling. He knows that from now on the bird seed will be stored away properly and the shed door will be locked and that I’ll leave out some scraps before we go to bed.

Published by Bookmice.com The Nose Remembers When A warm spring day at the the Inn makes me restless. I’ve been storing energy all Winter and need to get out and go somewhere. I start to th ink of foreign trips to take. W ith all the Spring planting and general clean-up-after-winter work to be done that isn’t usually possible. So instead, when I want a day off, I take my nose for a walk. I cut fresh grass, toss hay in the barn, smell the freesias, dig in the newly-exposed moist earth, or rub my face in the warm fur of a cat. Like a detective or a bloodhound on a hunt, I’m scenting out smells to stimulate me because I know that every odor that comes accidentally or intentionally to my nose will instantly whisk me away to times and places in memory more quickly than a jet could carry me to an exotic locale. It’s a vacation in recall that I can return to and from without jetlag and come back refreshed every time. It’s no wonder our noses are right in the middle of our faces, up front and sticking out where we can poke it into things. Neuroanatomists tell us that is it’s a very short distance from the receptor cells in the nose to the target cells in the brain, to those bumpy brows and frontal lobes that we worked so hard through the millennia to develop. By contrast, your fingers are a long way from your brain. If your nose was any closer to the brain, it would be your brain. (And maybe in some ways it is.) The fact that your nose has this enviable “local call” connection gives the environment an opportunity to wage an upfront and personal attack on our brains, es pecially on our memories, through our senses. Smells evoke emotionally charged memories as pungently as an electrical probe surgically applied directly to your grey cells would. (Don’t try is at at home!) The other senses are not so directly and uncompromisingly connected to the memory banks. Pinch your arm and you’re unlikely to immediately be transported to another time and place where you experience d a similar pinching sensation. Look at water cascading over rocks in a garden. Does it make yo u recall standing at the foot of a waterfall in the forest? You may know the memory is there and with some mental effort, connect the two but rarely does sight or touch trigger memory of such sensational, fully"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"The Quilt Inn Country Cookbook Aliske Webb © Aliske Webb 1999.

Television and the movies do everything they can to involve us emotionally by capitalizing on every nuance of our sight and sound senses. They even go so far as to wrap it around us like a cocoon in “virtual reality” games. If anyone ever figures out a way to incorporate smell into the movie-going experience, (the way cologne manufacturers have with magazine inserts), box office sales will go through the roof. They will have our heartstrings. We have inside us albums of memories just waiting to be opened by smell. The fragrance of fresh cut grass can immediately flood your being with sensation memories, of childhood, of Summer, the heat of sun, the cool of dew. You are magically two feet shorter and engr ossed in an inner world of olfactory holograms. Another time, the ephemeral whiff of a familiar cologne instantaneously conjures up the face of a long ago lover, the warmth of a body pressed against you in embrace, or the quiet tranquility of langorous time alone. And on and on through the fragrant canyons of our memories. Smell can trigger paroxisms of e motions, veritable avalanches of emotion. It’s a good thing that our brains also easily habituate to smells. We consciously smell something only when it is newly introduced. Within seconds the brain turns off its sensitivity and we are no longer aware of it. Sit in a smoke-filled room, or beside with a wet dog, or near food cooking. After a few minutes you won’t be able to smell it. Go outside and breathe different, new air. Return to the room and you will again sense the “new” smell. It’s a protective device our brains evolved to keep us from being overlo aded with information. Otherwise we would be walking zombies, adrift in hallucinatory smell-induced reveries. We also know that the sense of taste that we think is centered in our mouths really only detects four qualities: sweet, sour, salty and bitter. The rest of our “taste” is in our noses. It’s the nose that has myriads of specialized receptors to detect the crowded univers e of compounds that make up the foods we eat. It’s the nose that saved our animal forebears (from being only three-bears) by differentiating what was edible from what was poisonous. By the time it was in the mouth, it would have been too late. Which explains why you can’t taste Mom’s chicken soup w hen you have a head cold.

All rights reserved. Published by Bookmice.com Adam’s Search for the Ultimate Rib We have traveled all across North America, searching for the ultimate rib. Surprisingly, there are many others who have also embarked on this culinary quest. In fact, if you mention to someone that you are a “rib freak”, they are just as likely to tell you about their favorite restaurant, recipe, or sauce. We even have a friend, Gerry, who collects jars of sauces. Some people have wine cellars, but there’s our Ger, down in his basement late at night, applying a quarter turn to each dusty bottle, to keep the lid wet, naturally. Ribs differ wherever you go. Some people prefer pork ribs, the side variety for thinness, baby backs for meaty, sweet flavor, country style for thick pleasure, or sweet and sour cuts. Others swear by beef ribs, from the full bone of the standing rib roast to the short rib type. And then there’s the sauce. Ah, sauce! Ketchup-based, mustard-enhanced, garlicked, honeyed, hickory-smoked, hot, medium, sweet, or even no sauce at all. The varieties are as endless as the rib aficionados who swear by them. Many of the commercially prepared sauces rely on an ingredient called “liquid smoke ” to give a hickory flavor to the sauce. Liquid smoke was first commercially prepare d in Nebraska in 1895, originally from the tar of burned wood that was dissolved in water (boy , does that ever sound good!). Nowadays, it is synthetically produced and the unhealthy tars and resins have been removed. Because it is concentrated, a very small amount of this ingredient goes a long, long way and c an easily overpower more subtle flavors. For some, hickory smoke is an acquired taste and should never stand in the way of enjoying ribs, your way. And so once committed to the rib quest, one needs to search out, in every eating establishment, the “rib dinners” on the menu. However, for the true and venturesome, connoisseur, it’s simply a matter of saying, “I’ll have the ribs, please.” We hav e eaten ribs in franchise-type restaurants, in smoky beer joints, in specialty places where the ribs are smoked in a pit, or baked in a brick oven for up to 24 hours. Naturally we think those at the Quilt Inn are the best. But the joy of the quest"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"The Quilt Inn Country Cookbook Aliske Webb © Aliske Webb 1999. All rights reserved. Published by Bookmice.com is that it is never-ending. Oh, rapture! The best rib story I can think of, I owe to Alan Alda in his role as “Hawkeye Pierce” on the long-running television series, M*A*S*H. During this memorable episode, Hawkeye has had two weeks of liver and fish, and he’s had enough. As he says, “I’ve eaten a river of liver and an ocean of fish, and I won’t take it any longe r!” What’s the answer? “Ribs,” he says to his partner in crime, Trapper John McIntyre. “But not ju st any ribs. They have to be ‘Adam’s Ribs’. With sauce. And coleslaw. From Chicago!” Their bounty is shipped all the way to Korea marked “medical supplies”, and after a number of comic mishaps, finally arrive. Was it worth it? Any rib-lover watching the episode would say, “Yes!” We couldn’t understand why anyone would think it an unreasonable request, or quest, at all. The search for the ultimate rib goes on. It knows no boundaries. There are as many ways to cook ribs at home as there are sauces to cook them in: boil to tenderize, marinate or not, bake, broil, barbecue. I think we’ve tried them all and here are the best of the ones we like to prepare. Hot Dijon Ribs 4 lbs. pork spareribs 1 cup liquid honey 3/4 cup Dijon mustard 2 tbsp.

Her favorite expression for her feeling at that time of day was, “ When ah sits, ah sits loose!” Now there’s a country Inn attitude for you—learn to sit loose. The important thing about a country Inn is to have lots of favorite places to sit. Each one needs to be different and inviting yet has to make the sitter feel that they are the first to have found this particular spot, with this special outview of the world or that unusual insight into life. If you need lessons on favorite spots around the Inn, find one of the Inn cats. They know the best places and they usually don’t mind a little, if quiet, company. We have several cats and lots of places. You need to find, however, the cat whose personality matches your sittin’ mood. Now Nine Patch, for example, our long hair calico cat, is built for comfort not speed. Michael say s that from behind she looks like a hairy bowling ball with a tail. A true “Garfield” of cats, you see her ambling slowly around the place, examining every blade of grass like a reincarnated Sixties hippie on bad drugs and blinking sleepily through half-open eyes. Nine Patch looks for comfort and she usually dozes on a cosy quilt- covered chair on the porch out of the wind, in a sunny window seat or behind the orchard wall on a warm stone slab. Her places are warm and cosy and sleep-inducing. If you’re in a mellow mood, follow Nine Patch and take a book but only if you don’t intend to read it. Dixie, on the other hand, is a gadabout cat. A fluffy brain less grey and white furball, she’s the kind of a cat that starts to purr as soon as she enters the room as if announcing, “OK, everyone, I’m here and I’m looking for love!” She purrs if you just look at her from across the room. Dixie pays no particular mind to comfort. She’ll sleep anywhere, anytime, no matter how lumpy it is so long as there are people about or the potential of people about. Quite foolishly, she’ll sleep in doorways, busy doorways at that, waiting to make sure she’s there to catch any tidbitd of conversation or food, and often getting stepped on.

Her places are quiet unobtrusive spots to sit and watch the world, without being seen watching. They’re philosophical, often elevated and hard to reach places. Least visited, most treasured. The loft in the barn by the window overlooking the courtyard, top of the bookshelf, behind the lattice under the porch. Awkward, I agree. You may have to find your own Hobbes-like places where you can be alert, watchful, and contemplative. Or, Like Edna Mae, you can just “sit loose” in a wicker or rocking chair on the long porch that runs across the front of the Inn. Picnic fare goes well with good sittin’ places. At the Quilt Inn, many guests like to go off by themselves and enjoy space, quiet contemplation, and alfresco dining. We pack picnic lunches. Tuna fish for Nine Patch, Dixie and Hobbes is optional.

Published by Bookmice.com Tomatoware Tomatofare I’ve been haunting antique shows shops and flea markets for years. Which is why the Inn is filled with an eclectic mix of antique furniture and bizarre collections. I’m always on the lookout for that fabulous $10 unrecognized treasure. Happily, I’ve found a couple. Like a gambler convinced a big win is at hand, I’m hooked on bargain hunting. I’ve also outsmarted myself on occasion, by being part-smart about antiques. Caveat emptor . Antique dealers are seldom as dumb as we would like to thin k they are. If something is that cheap, it’s probably a fake. You’re the only one who doesn’t know it. The first time I remember seeing “tomatoware”, I laughed at the idea of making dishes, teapots, creams and sugars, salts and peppers, and so forth, to look like something so mundane as a tomato. “Who would buy that?” I said to Michael and we scoffed. “I would never buy anything that gaudy!” I said smugly. Well, as my wise old Grandma used to say, “Never say ‘never’, you just never know!” Check out the front cover of this book. Yes, that’s our Chatham cupboard, circa 1900, and part of our tomatoware collection, circa 1907. The Chatham was a contemporary of the Hoosier cupboard and it stands in the Summer kitchen that was converted into an informal family dining room. You see, we kept seeing it everywhere. We kept laughing at it. Until we finally had to buy some because it was, well, bizarre. And after all, it was cheap. That was a few hundred dollars ago! Once we were committed to ownership, we did some research. We found out there are seve ral nationalities of tomatoware. Surprisingly, the Italians don’t make tomatoware—too busy cooking with the original fruit, I suppose. The most expensive is Bayreuth, made of fine china in Germany. Then there is cheap and cheerful American pottery tomatoware. And finally there is knockoff Japanese pottery. Of course, now that we specialize, we only collect the Occupied Japan tomatoware! At least I stopped laughing at it. In fact, I think it’s started to laugh at me. Note the teapot on the cover. And I learned a whole lot more about antiques in the process. The stuff has grown on me.

Words, Words, Words There’s a pond beyond the barn. I suppose it was originally used for watering cattle on the farmstead. Now it’s just a bucolic landing field for migrant ducks and geese. It’s late Summer so the birds are gregarious and approachable, within reason. Every evening Geoffie and I take leftover bread to the haggle of ducks at the pond. I don’t know what the collective noun for ducks is. I know flock of geese, flock of sheep, herd of catt le. There’s probably a proper name for ducks by the dozen. (It’s called “dinner” in France!) In the absence of knowledge I invented a haggle of ducks. If you’ve ever fed ducks in a park in the city, you’ll know why it’s so descriptive. After all, aren’t col lective nouns supposed to be descriptive? Shouldn’t the wordsound evoke the picture and be a metaphor for the group consciousness or character of the species in question? Some are, some aren’t. A pride of lions sounds good. It might be a little anthropomorphic but it’s a good visual. So is a swarm of locusts (even if it does give you yukkie frissons ). I don’t think barrel of monkeys is the correct, albeit familiar, term. I’ve never much liked litter of kittens. I prefer a tumble of kittens. That’s the picture. How about a scurry of mice. Or a frisk of colts? It makes me see them cavort and kick up their heels. A thundering of horses. A circus of squirrels. Whoever thought up some of these collective nouns wasn’t using their imagination. Why a school of fish? A platoon of minnows wheeling in mysterious and synchronous formation would be much more appropriate. So would a hurdle of salmon, leaping over obstacles to mate and die. Whenever I hear the term pack of wolves, I think “six-pack” and it seems too orderly for such independent creatures. I can’t help picture them strung together with pulltabs. Sled-dogs maybe. A pod of pe as makes some sort of vegetative sense. It implies a husk-ness. But I don’t know what a pod of whales would be like.

Mark Twain wrote an amusing short story about Adam and Eve working their way around Eden naming all the creatures. As I recall, Eve did most of the naming, bagging all the good names, much to the irritation of Adam. Quite so. It seems mightily appropriate that we are called the race of humans, of course. It’s un questionably a relay race. See the unique upright bipedal stance, arms with opp osable thumbs outstretched clutching a baton of tools to be passed from one runner to another in the forward thrust of evolution.

Published by Bookmice.com Hunka Hunka Burning Love We had a special guest drop by the other day. Bill Parker was passing through town and needing a place to stay, was recommended to The Quilt Inn by Horace the pump jockey down at the Service Station across from the Cheese Shoppe. We’re always delighted to learn new and interesting things from our visitors but Bill’s comments on sitting down to one of our home-cooked meals, set us back a bit. “Not very spicy,” he said, adding more pepper from the pepper mill. “Do you have any Tabasco Sauce or better yet, Sauce From Hell?” The latter, I learned, is a local specialty in his town. It’s prime ingredient is chiles and of course this led to a conversation about these fiery little devils. Bill travels out of his native State a great deal an d was well prepared for the relatively bland tastebuds of “foreigners”. He had some Habenero peppers in his carry bag which he generously offered t o share with me. One taste and the heat was so intense I nearly fainted. With a gasp, I asked Michael for three things. “Water! 911! Last rites!” Most people would avoid such incendiary peppers. Not Bill and his asbestos- lined fellow gastronomes. Some crave the wave. They crave the heat. Once I had recovered, Bill explained that a true pepper fiend wouldn’t even flinch at the ordinary Jalapeno, considering it child’s play. “Myself, I particularly like the Scotch Bonnet,” said Bil l, a native of Louisiana where his mother had introduced him to the taste of spicy food. I’m rather fond of an occasional drink,and the image of a “Scotch bonnet” produced a vision of Bushmill’s neat in a glass with a paper hat on it. It turns out that the Scotch Bonnet is a pepper, a close cousin to the Habanero, related in the same way as the Hatfields and the McCoys, who incidentally at this very time were having a war of their own in my stomach. These two peppers are kings of the Scoville Scale, a system that rates peppers based on capsaicin content, the compound that makes chiles hot. At the bottom of the Scoville is the green bell pepper, with 0 Scoville Heat Units, or “H.U.” The Jalapeno, Bill said, smokes in around 2500 to 5000 H.U.’s. The"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"The Quilt Inn Country Cookbook Aliske Webb © Aliske Webb 1999. All rights reserved. Published by Bookmice.com Habenero and Scotch Bonnet fall into the 100,000 to 300,000 H.U. range. Other hot chiles include the Thai, at 50,000 to 100,000 H.U., and the Pequin, Cayenne, and Tabasco peppers at 30,000 to 50,000 H.U., and the Arbol, 15,000 to 30,000 H.U. So, if you want to take the chile plunge, what do you do with them? Here’s what Bill suggests. Chiles will grow mould in a few short days. Store them in a dry place for up to a week, or preserve them by roasting. Cover with a bit of olive oil. A warning: handle the exotic chiles with care. Some can blister the skin, so wear rubber gloves and do not touch your eyes with hands still contaminated. Insidentally, chile peppers have less nutritional value than sweet peppers but still contain vitamins A,C and E. Roast them, and vitamin levels decrease. Roast Chiles If You Dare Cut a small slit in the chile close to the end to let the steam escape. Place the chile on a baking sheet directly under the broiler and turn with tongs. Or, bake them in a 375F oven for 30 minutes. When the chile darkens and blisters, remove from heat and place in a plastic bag or damp paper towels for 10 or 15 minutes. Remove from bag and peel away skin. Chilies can be frozen in freezer bags for convenient use. When d o you use chiles and where? “Anytime, anyplace,” Bill informed us. “Anything you make or eat can be spiced up with a liberal, or conservative, sprinkling of fresh or roasted chiles.” After a breakfast of spicy Heuvo s Rancheros, Bill drove away, leaving us to ponder this new information and whether or not our guests could handle the heat. But as my Grandma would say, “If you can’t handle the heat, get out of the kitchen!” Or was that someone else? Never mind.

Published by Bookmice.com Who Will Pick Up My Stitches When I’m Gone? We went to a funeral today. A woman in the Quilt Guild passed away from cancer. She left a grief-stricken husband and a bereft teenage daughter. She had been an active quilter for many years and an important member of the Guild. Her death was so sudden it caught everyone by surprise, including her, I think. Her last quilt was still in the frame in a corner of the living room. Where the quilt extended past the area held by the frame, there were many lengths of thread hanging loose, ready to be rethreaded and continued along the pencilled quilt lines. I was filled with eerie tingles as I looked at the now-unfinished quilt. Surely Carol would return at any time now and sit down at the frame. Carol’s daughter left the frame standing and as the Guild members came by the house, she welcomed them in and softly asked each of us if we would put a few stitches in her Mom’s last quilt. Each of us in turn picked up Carol’s needles and thread and carefully matched our stitches to hers. It felt somehow like an intrusion into somebody else’s work and at the same time felt like a connection, a final communion with Carol. Carol’s daughter, a modern teenager, had never bothered to learn how to quilt. She didn’t need to. Her mother would make her anything she wanted. Today, however, she asked us to show her how and she sat with us for a long time struggling with the unfamiliar stitching technique. She is determined now to finish her mother’s quilt. The members offered to help. We are going to take over a full size quilt frame next week and put Carol’s quilt in it. That will allow sever al women to sit and quilt at the same time, inste ad of just one. Quilting should be a communal activity. Every Tuesday eveni ng, whoever is available will go over and quilt with her. There is a teenage daughter who needs to find her mother, and we, her mother’s friends, will sit by her as she does so. When I think about picking up the stitches that Carol left unsown, I wonder who will pick up my own unfinished stitches when I’m gone."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"The Quilt Inn Country Cookbook Aliske Webb © Aliske Webb 1999.

Published by Bookmice.com The Wrong Arm of the Law Early this morning, Jeff Bob Burnet, the town sheriff, dropped by to return our post-hole digger. We sat for a spell in rocking chairs on the porch. There are strings that run from the garden to the carved wood “ging erbread” trim that runs under the eaves where morning glories and string beans grow up. It makes a cool dappled shade on the porch on a late August morning as the day begins to get too hot. We had fresh blueberries at the Inn so we tucked into some blueberry oatmeal squares. Despite being car eful not to have the luscious purple fruit stain our fingers, we left unmistakable incriminating fingerprints on our napkins. As we enjoyed our morning cup of coffee, we shared some local gossip and I was reminded of the story about how Jeff Bob got to be sheriff. Jeff Bob’s always been something of a loose cannon as a sheriff but you would have a hard time replacing him now. His notoriety and popularity came as a result of his unbridled and perhaps unwise enthusiasm in running for the job of sheriff. County elections are usually low key and uninteresting events around here, and in most other places for that matter. There’s the usual flutter of hand-ma de support signs that litter lawns and shop windows for several weeks. The local newspaper carries each nominee’s election ad, which is usually not much more than conservative resumes and raison de vote . The strength of most nominees’ credentials seem to lie on thei r stable home life (wife, 3 kids, dog Spot), and number of years in the community. Knowledge of law is never much of a factor. Not much remarkable happens and then the keys to the two cell jail building change hands quietly. And life goes on. Until the year Jeff Bob decided to run. Which is tough to do when you have your foot in your mouth. Jeff Bob was decidedly at a disadvantage since he’s a forty-plus bache lor and only moved here five years previously after being laid off from a steel worker’s job. He came, temporarily, to help his brother-in-law and ended up staying. It often happens that way. But Jeff Bob brought some dark clouds with him. It seems there was a great deal of rancor and hard feelings at the steel plant between the management and the"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"The Quilt Inn Country Cookbook Aliske Webb © Aliske Webb 1999. All rights reserved. Published by Bookmice.com workers. He was one of the many caught in a political and financial crossfire, and he deeply resented the predictable outcome, “out you go”. I guess he was sti ll stinging from the surprise and earnestly felt it was such an important issue, and, since he had no sterling family and background to tout, that he unwisely assured the townsfolk in his brief campaign ad that if elected he would always maintain an “open door policy” with regards to his job as sheriff. He meant there would be no surprises. It was a deadly phrase. The small ad never did explain his intention behind the expression. Brevity led to levity. What sort of town has an “open door” jail? The morning the newspaper hit the sidewalk there was mixed hilari ty and consternation around town. He meant, of course, open door to the community, not to offenders but that’s not how it sounded and the local wags razzed him mercilessly for weeks before the ele ction. It as hard to tell if the red face JB stomped around town in was from embarrassment, or anger. The surprise came on election day and none was more surprised than Jeff Bob when he won. Perhaps the wags felt they owed him their vote, to give him back his face. Perhaps there were enough people around town, like myself, who think you just gotta vote for a guy with either the silliness or the earnestness to profess an open door policy for a jail. So now it’s passed into being a gentle joke. Even Jeff Bob wears it lightly. Although we’re still a town divided. There are those who want to put up a sign procla iming our status as a town with an open door policy jail, and those who are definitely not amused at all.

Published by Bookmice.com if you can, and, ideally, do your preparation on marble. Always prepare your pastry and then turn on the oven. And don’t overwork the dough—it will be tough if you do. (The crust, that is.) Combine flour and salt in mixing bowl. Add sugar or herbs. Add butter and shortening, and working quickly, use a pastry blender, 2 knives, or your fingertips to cut in the ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle ice water over the mixture 1 or 2 tbsp. at a time, and toss after each addition. When you can gather the dough into a ball, you’ve added enough water. Transfer the dough to a cool surface, and using the heel of your hand, push the dough away 1/4 cup at a time. Repeat until all dough is “smeared”. This will make a flaky crust. Gather the dough into a ball, divide in half. Flatten each half slightly, wrap in wax paper and refrig erate 30 minutes to 1 hour. When you’re ready to bake, roll out the dough, again on a cool table (Formica, wood or marble are best). Lightly flour the surface and the top of the dough. Rub a bit of flour on your rolling pin. Flatten the dough into a disk shape and then roll from the center to the edge. Lift and turn the dough while rolling, sprinkling lightly with flour to prevent sticking. Rolll the dough until it is about 1/3 inch thick and extends about 1 1/2 to 2 inches beyond the edge of the pie plate. If you need to “patch up” the dough, moisten the edges with water first so that they will stick together. When you’re making a two-crust pie, seal the upper and lower crust with water, and “flute” the edges with a fork. Cut slits in the upper crust to allow steam to escape. The top crust can be either plain, or try one of the following glazes for a special effect: brush lightly with milk or cream; sprinkle the crust with sugar; brush with a beaten egg and water (just a bit) mixture."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"The Quilt Inn Country Cookbook Aliske Webb © Aliske Webb 1999. All rights reserved. Published by Bookmice.com Follow-wing The Leader Michael and I were sitting on the porch the other day, enjoying some early warm Spring weather. High overhead a flock of Canadian Geese were circling, preparing to land in the pond, to pause and refresh, before continuing their long journey North. The famous V-formation is a familiar and welcome sight, albeit a curious one. Although a lot of birds flock and fly together, geese seem to be the only birds with such an organized flight path. Scientists and aerodynamic experts discovered that the geese fly in this pattern for a very good reason: as each bird flaps its wings, it creates an uplift for the bird immediately behind. By flying in V-formation, the whole flock adds at least 70% greater flying range than if each bird flew alone. Whenever a goose falls out of formation, it suddenly feels increased drag and air resistance, so it quickly gets back into formation to take advantage of the lifting power of the other birds in the flock. This is really good news for heavy birds with a long way to go, like geese. I wonder wh y they don’t teach other birds to do likewise. And how about us—the unlikeliest flyers of all? If we work together, and share a common direction and a sense of purpose, we will all get to where we are going quicker, and easier, because we will be travelling on the trust, and the thrust, of each other. One of the wonderful sounds of Spring is the inimitable honking of the returning geese as they travel along together. The geese in the rear are honking encouragement to th ose up front, as if to say, “Don’t give up, keep up your speed, our goal is just around the corner!” When one of the geese is sick or wounded or simply too tired to fly today, two other geese will fall out of the flock, and watch over it until it recovers or dies. Then they will rejoin the original flock, or start one of their own. We, too, must look after others through the bonds of humanity and common sense. We must help those who are wounded, which sometimes includes ourselves, and then start again with renewed purpose. Being lead bird is a tough job and takes the most amount of energy. When the"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"The Quilt Inn Country Cookbook Aliske Webb © Aliske Webb 1999. All rights reserved. Published by Bookmice.com leader tires, it falls back. There is always another in the flock to take up the lead. Every bird in turn takes the lead. It occurs to me that if we have at least as much sense as geese, we will stay in formation with others who are also going in the same direct ion as we are, and take advantage of the momentum that others have created for us. Take the lead when called on, and let others take the lead when we tire. Light cooking trends today call for less red meat in the diet.

It belongs to one of the many invisible people who help make an Inn run smoothly. In this case it’s Clareville’s only resident Russian emigre, Tamara Shostokovitch. (“Not that one, da'link, he vas much too bourgeois !” she would always explain.) Tamara is anywhere upwards of seventy—it’s your guess. And although she wears grubby old America n blue jeans, her frazzled grey hair is still held back in place by a colorful Babushka , the ubiquitous Russian kerchief. Tamara runs a small market garden and supplies us with fresh vegetables such as potatoes, cabbage and squash, common vegetables to be sure, but staples that are familiar and comfortable for her because they recall he r childhood in a Russia very different than today. She even delivers to us once a fortnight because she comes from the “old school” when a fortnight meant something. What it means is, we never know when she will arrive. She’s always welcome. This morning, after we helped her unload her produce into the root cellar, we all went to th e kitchen for a cup of coffee because today Tamara brought with her a treas ure from her homeland to share with us. It was a copy of A Gift To Young Housewives by Elena Molokhovets. This wonderful book was a ser ious work at the time, but is now both hilarious and nostalgic, and I’d like to share some of it with you. Gift first appeared in Russia in 1861, the year of the emancipation of the serfs (“Serfs up!” was thereby introduced into the local lexicon). This huge volume of over"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"The Quilt Inn Country Cookbook Aliske Webb © Aliske Webb 1999. All rights reserved. Published by Bookmice.com 4,200 recipes provides us with a window from which to view a lost and somewhat forgotten age, where a well run household, serfless (see above) yet with servants, was equal only to running a major corporation today. The typical young Russian bride needed all the organizational capabilities of a major-general. In fact, the author, Elena Molokhovets, was from a military family, and her meal preparations came by her honestly. She had ten children, nine boys and a girl, as well as many grandchildren, either too numerous to count or missing from the Russian census. Gif t was an instant and utter success, and Elena continued to revise, edit (although clearly with a light hand) and add to the book for another 50 years, when she disappeared without a trace, presumably a victim of the Revolution, or indigestion. After th e Revolution, she was quoted widely, albeit sarcastically, in Soviet circles, such as her answer to the problem of unexpected guests. “Send the servant into the cold cellar for hazel grouse or a ham.” But of course! Many of Lenin’s followers held her responsible for representing the excesses of bygone days. Is Julia Child’s fate to be the same? Anyway, after a few years, the acerbic humor became more wistful, and turned eventually into disbelief. Could a time of such foodstuffs ever have existed in the Motherland? Had family members ever sat down to huge meat pies, sturgeon in aspic, mounds of crayfish, souffles and babas ? Had there ever been a time when there was so much caviar that it was used to clarify beef bouillon and then thrown away ? Even though the servants certainly we ren’t eating these delicacies, they did have access to abundance. There were pirogi (a k ind of pie), kasha (grains), shchi (cabbage soup), kvass (a beverage f ermented from black bread), beets, potatoes, roast goose, duck, pork, and beef, many varieties of fresh, dried and marinated fish, sauerkraut, sausage and pickles. These sta ples became harder and harder to find after the Revolution, even with the exalted “progress” advertised on a yearly basis by Leni n, Stalin, et seq . Twentieth Century modernism that never quite made it from revolutionary tome to actuality. Tamara, our Russian expatriate, urged us to incorporate many of the recipes as regular fare at The Quilt Inn. I think not. Not because we are not adventurous but"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"The Quilt Inn Country Cookbook Aliske Webb © Aliske Webb 1999. All rights reserved. Published by Bookmice.com rather because the cookbook presupposes a completely different way of life than we are used to now. Molokhovets assures us that we, too, can have fresh pears from our orchard in the middle of Winter. How? According to Gift , each pear, carefully culled, was placed in its own small individual copper saucepan with a lid and laid in t he ice house. (We don’t have one of those, either). Every two weeks a servant wiped off each and every pear, and the saucepan it rested in. (You can understand a people who rose up and demanded a revolution, if only to be taken off pear detail!) And even more, close to the house was a store room of vast size, used to hold food for the almost-always large family, guest s, and hangers-on. Mushrooms were grown in the basement. Lemons were lined up on the shelves, none touching a sister, each to be wiped dry every fortnight. Kegs of sauerkraut had to be poked once a week with a pole to allow the dangerous build up of methane gases to escape. (Horrors! If you missed a week of keg-poking...BOOM! Death by sauerkraut!) Cauliflowers strung from the ceiling needed constant attention, and the windows were opened each morning and closed each night. Even bacon had to be constantly rotated. And the cook slept in the kitchen, on a foldout bed covered with a seaweed mattress. This was necessary because cook was always preparing for the next repast. A simple dinn er took 24 hours to prepare, and who knew when the Cossack hordes would d escend upon the house (or your brother-in-law and his family!) You may disag ree, but our feeling is that a cookbook like A Gift To Young Housewives is to be enjoyed as armchair travelling to the past, not as a “how to” for the present. Thank you, Tamara, for sharing this wonderful nostalgic vision that is exotic, thought provoking, unsettling and for forcing us to remember what was and why it isn’t that way anymore.

Leave 1 inch space at top of jar. Fit a piece of plastic wrap on to top of cabbage so air does not reach it. Seal jar with lid, but do not tighten—this allows fermentation gases to escape—eliminates need to “keg poke”, and unnecessary explosions! Store at 68–72F to enha nce fermentation process. Check occasionally and remove any scum that appears on the surface of the cab bage. (Scum won’t form if plastic wrap is tight enough). Fermentation will stop after 2 to 6 weeks. Sauerkraut is ready when no bubbles appear on the surface and jar does not hiss when opened. If kraut is too salty for your taste, rinse it before serving.

Published by Bookmice.com September Fair Once a month on a Saturday from early Spring until late Autumn, we engage in a ritual of going into downtown Clareville to visit the Farmer’s Market that takes place in the Town Square. There, midst the tall oaks and maples, between the bandshell and the fountain, citizens of the area arrive at dawn to exhibit and sell their wares. Tents and tables litter the greenspace in orderly confusion. I like to be first and early at the Market. In the near dark morning, Michael and I sip coffee seated in a window booth at Ivy’s Restaurant while the vendors set up. The dawn chorus of birds vie with a portable radio and good humored neighborly chatter echoes in the still and frosty air. Chickens cackle in their cages and an irritable rooster is barking at the morning. The few early birds come to the Market for the fattest worms: the pick of the best produce—the plumpest peppers, the unblemished tomatoes, bread still warm from the oven to be sniffed and savored and carried home as prizes. We are still hunters and gatherers who return triumphant and satisfied from a good forage. The rest of the flock descends by late morning. By then the Square is full and frantic. Hands dart here and there, quickly picking goods, making change, filling bags. Shoulders jostle to the stalls and tables, and jostle away again. Friends meet and chat, some hug, balancing parcels, blocking the way of others trying to gain access to the vendor’s attention—a pleasant communal irritation. Some swoop in—if they find a lucky parking spot—raid the essential stalls, list in han d, and swoop away again. Some come to roost all day. Making their way systematically from vendor to familiar vendor, chatting, sampling, buying. Stopping to lunch on thick cut peameal bacon on a kaiser as a special not-on-the-diet treat; or on quiche and wine at the trendy Stone House Inn; or on toasted club sandwiches at Ivy’s cafe in the park, a temporary fair weather al fresco extension served from her restaurant across the street. The black-brown and black-blue grackles have landed en masse on the green and are having their own lively disagreement. By late afterno on, the hustle and hurry has slowed to a tired and langorous saunter.

Bargains are offered to clear stock that won’t keep fresh until next Market. The late bird may not get the fattest worm, but does get the slimmest prices. Around dinnertime, on a silent and mysterious signal, everyone heads home like the starlings w ho have begun to wheel in unison around the tall oaks and maples. Trucks pull up to the now-empty curbside to be loaded and the vendor gypsies steal away into early nightfall with sunburned faces and money in thei r pockets. There is hardly any energy left to talk. Good day, someone asks? A smile and nod in reply. Farewells are just weary waves or nods, and they are gone into the twilight. The green is empt y again. The starlings roost noisily in the tall maples and oaks. Streetlights come on. As if the whole flighty community had not even been there today.

All rights reserved. Published by Bookmice.com It’s All Greek To Me One of our favorite quotes from the movie Zorba the Greek goes, “ What I eat I turn into work and good humor.” Whether it’s in song, dance or food, Greeks love to share the joyful spirit. This would be called a joie de vivre but of course that’s an entirely d ifferent language, so instead. that phrase having already been taken, it’s called philoxenia . A friend from the old neighborhood, where we lived before the Quilt Inn days, came by to stay with us. George Spirodopolous brought Christina, his wife, and little Geor gio (who was at this time, five years older, a foot and a half taller and more worried ab out girls since we had last seen him!) It wasn’t long before they had comman deered the Inn kitchen, and several volunteers, to prepare some Greek specialties for our lucky guests. The emphasis of Greek food is simple preparation and wholesome ingredients which make it perfect “country cooking” for The Quilt Inn. And, it is relatively unchanged since Archestratus wrote the very first cookbook over 2000 years ago. Unfortunately, it was n ot a best seller. Since every recipe had to be chiselled on pieces of slate, (“carved in stone” we refer to it today), the book not only took many decades to complete but weighed more than the average Greek cupboard could hold. Can you imagine checking it out of the Romus Librarius? “Two days overdue, eh, Spiros? Get your hernia fixed—you have a date with the lions!”) Two things we discovered about Greek food from George and his family. First, much of the food is prepared with olive oil, which in today’s health conscious eating is very good because it holds cholesterol levels down. Second, the food keeps extremely well, not only providing great leftovers but often tasting better the second time around. Legend has it that Greek food is so aromatically delicious that one can swoon in ecstasy. Me, I thought it was the amount of garlic in many dishes! So, George, Christina, and little Georgio wish you bon appetit ...no,no, there we go again...they wish you Kali Orexi !"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"The Quilt Inn Country Cookbook Aliske Webb © Aliske Webb 1999. All rights reserved. Published by Bookmice.com Appetizers (me zethes) are meant to be sampled sparingly, with ouzo as an accompaniment.

Small quantities go a long way. Cut chunks of goat cheese or any solid white cheese. There are several excellent Greek cheese that are best for this dish. Try Kasseri which is a mild Chedd ar-like cheese, or Kefalograviera, which is like Gruyere, or Manouri, an unsalted table cheese. Dust cheese lightly with flour. Heat a cast iron skillet or griddle to medium heat. Add butter and fry the cheese until golden brown. Remove pan from heat. Warm ½ oz. Brandy, pour it over the cheese and light it carefully. Serve with a flourish! Yell “Opa!”, “To your health!” You can also add slices of black Amphissa olives or sausage just before you flambe the Saganaki.

Serve on a bed of shredded lettuce, with tomato salsa and thinly sliced onion. George tells me that the white chef’s hat that is customarily worn in most kitchens of many fine restaurants (including ours), had its origins in Greece. It seems that the sh ape is based on Greek monk’s hats. Chefs used to seek refuge in the monasteries to avoid persecution (when one of their recipes really went bad!) In any event, the different colors made it easy to tell who was a monk and who was a chef, so that there was no monk-eying around.

Drizzle with oil and toss. Place in serving bowl or on individual plates. Sprinkle with Feta cheese. There are many fine olive oils now available in grocery stores. The important thing to look for on the label is “extra virgin”. This term means the oil was pressed out of the olives in the original way, manually. This is the best olive oil. You may also see “pure” olive oil, which means the oil was pressed mechanically or processed with heat, used to obtain maximum yields, a good oil, but not the best. This is OK, but the heat erodes the fine subtle flavor and quality of the oil and ideally should not be used in processing olives. Try different brands of olive oil, because, unlike plain vegetable oils, they vary greatly in taste, depending on the kind of olives used, and like wine, also on the type of soil they grew in. Weather also changes the moisture and ripeness of olives. Many well-stocked Greek or Italian kitchens will have several different grad es and flavors of olive oil each to be used for specific purposes.

If you went to an arts and crafts show in ancient Greece, you would be wiser to take along your favorite recipes instead of your rendition of “Alexander’s Mother”. Cookery was considered the greater of the fine arts because it brought more con sistent pleasure.

George says that if you visit Greece, you will often see men sitting at outdoor cafes, sipping quantities of ouzo and playing with their Komboli, or worry beads. I’d be worried about going home too, with a snootful of ouzo under my chef’s hat! Many Greek pastries are legendary for their rich, honey-drenched sweetness. So instead, after a hearty Greek meal, we find these light spicy cookies to be an ideal ending along with fine coffee, and perhaps a little Sambuca.

Published by Bookmice.com Lionhearts Orphans are left on doorsteps. In baskets. In secrecy and embarrassment, and with sad entreaties to take care of the precious bundle inside. Here was another orphan to look after. At least, that’s how it felt when I went to the firehall last night to pick up a parcel. I wish the firemen would be more open about it and own up to it. There’s certainly nothing to be ashamed about. Not any more. Not these days. A lot of men have been caught doing it. When I returned to the Inn, Michael and I carefully opened the plainly wrapped package and gently lifted out our treasure. A beautiful applique quilt! Yes, our firemen quilt. On the “q.t.” Seven volunteer firemen get together every two weeks to eat pizza, drink beer, watch a ball game, and...quilt. You just never know what goes on behind closed doors, do you? It all s tarted five years ago after the terrible MacPherson fire. Three young children who should have never been left alone were trapped in the back bedroom of a rapidly collapsing house. By that strange power of coincidence or Divine intention that places the right people at the right place when they are needed, Dan, one of the volunteers, heard the call go out over his car radio. He’d been out that evening to The Rib House bar and remembered seeing Sam and Jessie MacPherson partying it up late. He knew that meant the kids were home unattended as usual. Fortunately, he was only eight blocks away at the time. Unfortunately, he had no equipment with him and the firehall was on the other side of town. He also knew that the poor wood frame houses on this side of town were just tinderboxes waiting to go up. Dan was the first on the scene and without even hesitating, he charged straight into the burning house. To this day, no one knows, not even Dan, how he found the children. The house was literally collapsing behind him as he went towards the bedrooms. Smashing the back window, he pushed two unconscious children to safety. Alt hough neighbors saw him go in the front, no one was watching the back of the building. By the time he got the third child to the window and out, both he and the baby were on fore themselves. Holding the child, and dragging him away from the house, he"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"The Quilt Inn Country Cookbook Aliske Webb © Aliske Webb 1999. All rights reserved. Published by Bookmice.com rolled on the ground to put out the fire, and then staggered to the front yard where help finally saw him. The burns and glass lacerations put him in the hospital for weeks. His hands were the most severely damaged. He underwent several more weeks of rehabilitation therapy. And another person was in the right place at the right time. His therapist nurse happened to be a quilter and as a part of his hand therapy, she started him quilting to regain strength in his wrists and mobility in his fingers. He found it to be a soothing form of necessary exercise and just kept doing it when he returned to work. No one was going to impugn this hero’s masculinity, so it became an accepted, if peculiar, th ing around the firehall. Slowly, a couple of other guys became curious, then interested and finally hesitatingly, joined in. Now it’s a regular clandestine part of their routine. Burly, gnarled, scarred, big-knuckled hands around the frame. Add I’m sure their talk must sometimes make the quilt blush. Their quilts are usually appliques. Not flowers or gentle little things like ladies might produce, but strong and bold like you would expect from men with hear ts like lions who face terrible, sudden, and terrifying dangers. Their quilts are full of movement and life. The proble m became what to do with the finished quilts. Michael and I are honored to be able to help. You see, when you visit The Quilt Inn, after you pass through the front door the first thing you see is a quilt hanging from the railing of the landing at the top of the stairs in the front hall. At the bottom of the stairs, Bruno, an antique wooden carousel dog picked up at an auction, stands guard. The quilt is on display so that guests from all around the country can see it and are able to purchase raffle tickets. Each year, on the anniversary of the fire, Dan draws the winner, who receives this wonderful gift by special delivery. All the funds are given to the local hospital. Firemen, perhaps more than anyone in town, know the value of the care for human life that a community hospital gives. By the way, the children are fine now. The older boy wants to be a fireman too, just l ike the hero who saved his life. And Sam and Jessie MacPherson are much chastened and at least more attentive parents."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"The Quilt Inn Country Cookbook Aliske Webb © Aliske Webb 1999.

Published by Bookmice.com Dream Again It’s cold, October, Hallowe’en. In the long field the corn stalks are gold and crispy. The supple green whooshing of Summer corn has given way to the dry rustlings of Autumn. The hand of cold wind leaves a moving caress across the field. From the house I hear children’s laughter as they toss and scuffle piles of leaves. Beyond the vegetable garden we planted a field of corn. For its golden salt and butter taste, and for the movie Field of Dreams . I walk through the field every Summer with the tall green stalks brushing against my shoulders and imagine, I, too, hear voices in the rustling. The voice of my grandmother telling me to remember my dreams. It’s easy to feel lost in the high corn. Ten feet into the field could be a hundred. The noise of the up close and crowded green myopia obliterates your sense of direction. You lose your perspective, your vision of distant horizons, in the immediacy. The first time I wandered into a cornfield I was disoriented. My brother, Bob, and I were playing tag, crashing around in the obscurring greenery. I suddenly realized I had lost his voice and noise. He had sneaked away. He was trying to scare me, as older brothers will do. It worked. I ran in every direction. I yelled. I jumped futilely toward the blue dome sky for bearings. I cursed Bob. The sun was high and hot overhead. A buzzing of insects surrounded me. My heart pounded in my ears. Then in the tumult I heard Grandma’s still voice. “Don’t be scared,” she said. “Think.” “Corn is planted in straight rows, silly,” I said to myself. “Follow the row to the edge of the field.” The panic left me. I didn’t know where I was or where the row would lead me but I knew how to get home. When I emerged I was dusty and a half mile from home. I could see Grandma standing on the porch waiting. Bob was sitting dejectedly on the step, in trouble for having abandoned me. In the end I had walked the long way through the field, but I could fin ally see where I was. Staying on a straight path will ultimately end up somewhere familiar."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"The Quilt Inn Country Cookbook Aliske Webb © Aliske Webb 1999. All rights reserved.

We were six to a car and drove nonstop to warmer weat her. It was early bleary-eyed dawn when we reached Georgia and stopped for breakfast. One of the fellas saw Cornbread on the recipe and, never having had it before, decided to try it. “It’s delicious,” I assured him. “How do you eat it?” he enquired, as the steaming plate arrived before him. Glancing at the assortment of condiments on the table, I suggested, “You could put honey or maple syrup on it.” He picked up a glass serving pitcher with amber liquid in it. You know the kind with the plastic handle and slide back spout. He doused the cornbread and eagerly picked up his fork. The thought had just crossed my idle mind that the syrup look ed a little watery, but figured they were being cheesey with the tourists, when Charlie started to gag and spit his mouthful all over. “Blah,” he cried to our surprise. “Don’t you like it?” I asked with my mouth full of peaches, as he gulped a glass of ice wa ter. “That’s vinegar!” he exclaimed. “I thought it looked a bit thin,” I mumbled.

All rights reserved. Published by Bookmice.com Loose Change One of the things I love about the Inn kitchen is the stone floor. It’s awfully cold, yes. On Winter morning you don’t dare set foot on it for fear of frostbite. But it’s great in the Summer because it keeps the kitchen cool even on the hottest days. The floor is made of large grey stone slabs that are still uneven and rough in places. But a hundred years of feet working for hours in the kitchen had worn a noticeably smooth path around the room. We put a big old rough hewn pine harvest table in the middle and surrounded it with an eclectic mix of old mismatche d wood chairs because the room looked empty without it. I grew up in a family that always gathered around the kitchen table to talk, and to laugh, and to make decisions, and sometimes even to eat. So, it’s here we gather for “important” talk. When couples visit the inn, the men will often ramble off doing “guy stuff”, leaving the women to gather informally around the harvest table and gab. Frequently the talk will turn to quilting and we share our “how I made my first quilt” stories. As I listen, it sometimes seems as if the spirits of the women who used to live here are shuffling around the old worn stones, waiting their turn to tell their stories too. Sally Marie and Cal were a couple who visited the Inn a number of times. Cal passed away last year. He had a wonderful sense of humor and great comic timing. We’re going to miss him. So, for the first time, Sal is here by herself. She told us her story. When Sally Marie got married, a long time ago, she was very young and there was little money to spend on any “extras” in life. Yet she was proud of the fine young man she had married. He worked hard and cared for her so completely. And when the young ones came along he was a strong and patient father no matter how tired he was at the end of the day. So how could she dare want for more? Every morning she rose early, long before Calvin woke up and she crept quietly out of the bedroom to start his breakfast. But one morning, she happened to stop briefly at the bureau, looked back at the sleeping Cal, and in a moment’s inspiration, she silently scooped up half the pocket change that Cal had left there the night before."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"The Quilt Inn Country Cookbook Aliske Webb © Aliske Webb 1999. All rights reserved. Published by Bookmice.com It was all of fifteen cents. A lot of money in those meagre days. She knew she couldn’t take it all but surely he wouldn’t miss just half the change. Cal said nothing that day, or evening. Sally felt a smug satisfaction that she was right. He hadn’t noticed. So, the next morning she did the same thing again. And the next. Pretty soon, pennies at a time, she had collected the dollar that she needed. She bought some fabric and needles and made her first quilt. So that was Sally’s “first quilt” story. But that was almost fifty years ago. And ye t every morning since then, Sally helped hers elf to Cal’s loose change. Some days there was a lot of change. Sometimes, when times were tough, there was not. Over the years Sally was able to provide many little extras for the family—a special dress for the girls or a baseball glove for the boys. Cal often bragged on Sally to their friends about what a wonderful housekeeper she was! She could stretch her houseke eping allowance further than anyone! Sally’s “penny larceny” just became a habit, even after they were comfortably off financially and she had emancipated access to all their money. There was something special about taking half of Cal’s change every day. Many years ago, for their twenty fifth wedding anniversary, Sally had her heart set on a trip to Arizona to see the Grand Canyon. Even though Cal had been laid off for several months, somehow there always seemed to be lots of change at the end of the day, to go into Sally’s secret fund. Despite the lean times, they were able to make the once-in-a-lifetime trip. “You know Cal died last Spring,” she said finally, quietly. “I was right there at the end. He was holding my hand. He looked me right in the eye and said ‘Sal Ga l’. He always called me ‘Sal Gal’. He said, ‘Sal Gal, keep the change!’ And he smiled that big stupid grin of his. That old fox! He knew all along. And he never said a word. Imagine that!” She shook her head. “All those years, and he never said a word.” Somehow it seems that great love is not in the big important things you say but in the little things you never say.

Published by Bookmice.com Sunday, Sunday In t he town that lies close to the Inn, Sunday always arrives the same way. Regardless of the weather, the first light of dawn softens the everyday sharp contours of the empty town streets. If you sleep with your window open and wake early enough, you can hear the bells ringing from the Church a mile away. There is a different feel to Sunday mornings, an almost ethereal stillness that allows itself to fold over the area only once a week. Even the news of the day, whether international , national, or the homegrown gossip variety, slows to a trickle and people become more reflective. Sunday is often called the “Sabbath” which derives from the Hebrew word “shabbat”, which means “cessation” or “rest”. A lot of people use Sunday to catch up on their sleep and therefore employ, and enjoy, the literal meaning of the word. In the Judeo-Christian tradition, Genesis records the first Sabbath a s a moment of Divine inspiration: “So God blessed the seventh day and hallowed it because on it God rested from all the work He had done in Creation.” This is not fa tigue but rather the restful satisfaction of completion. Yet, the true Sabbath transcends religious differences, and in fact may only be symbolic of the Sunday frame of mind: Jews and Seventh Day Adventists celebrate and repose between sunset Friday and sunset Saturday; Muslims on Friday; Buddhists on Sunday. Even those who don’t consider themselves religious have rituals they observe. Some read the Sunda y paper, poring over each item and feature with an unhurried thoughtfulness. Others go for a stroll in the park and feed the wildlife. Others visit with family and friends. At the Inn, we welcome all the diversities, as well as the similarities. One need only to be seeking good food, pleasant company and respite from one’s normal day-to- day activities to enjoy brunch at The Quilt Inn. It’s time they put aside for repose and renewal. As one of the locals said, “Coming to the Inn every Sunday is like a mental health day for me!” We’re always glad that they do. Sun day brunch should be a leisurely, special meal.

Brunch should always start with fresh juice. It takes extra time to prepare but tastes so much better than any pre-packaged kind. If you don’t like citrus juice s like orange or grapefruit, try a vegetable juice like spicy tomato, or carrot. I don’t kn ow why all the great, and famous, coffees, seem to originate in Europe. Perhaps they’ve learned the art of relaxing and truly savoring their food and drink. Here are some morning coffee recipes to sip while you read the newspaper or think about what you’re going to do today... Viennese Coffee For every cup of coffee, melt 1 oz. semisweet chocolate with 1 tablespoon heavy cream in the top of a double boiler. Gradually whisk in coffee until frothy. Pour into large coffee cups. Top with whipped cream and sprinkle with cinnamon or grated orange zest. Belgian Coffee For each c up of coffee fold 1 beaten egg white into 1 tablespoon whipped cre am and put into bottom of coffee cup. Pour in hot coffee until cream floats to surface. Garnish with cocoa powder. Cafe Brulot Combine 5 cinnamon sticks, 3 strips of orange peel and 2 stirps of lemon peel, with 1 teaspoon allspice and 8 cubes sugar in a chafing dish or skillet. Pour in 1 cup of Cognac and heat without stirring until the liquid is warm. Light the liquor with a match and stir until the flames go out. Pour in 6 cups strong hot coffee and stir.

Published by Bookmice.com But for tho se of you who prefer tea, the English are renowned for their fussiness when it comes to preparing a “proper cup of char”. I lived in England for a number of years, perhaps long enough for them to convince me that it really does make a difference in the taste. A “Proper” Cup of Tea A really g ood cup of tea always starts with tea leaves. This has the added advantage of allowing you a wider choice in the kin d of tea you use. Just like wine, there are mild teas, mellow teas, and really sharp, strong teas, and there are marvellous flavored teas. Just be sure you always warm the teapot first. Place your tea leaves loose in the pot—one for each cup of tea, and “one for the pot.” Fill a kettle with fresh water. Never re-boil water for tea. Bring the water to a full rolling boil and pour into the teapot. Cover for 5 minutes and let it steep. Pour the tea through a fine mesh strainer into china cups. Tea should always be served in china cups, serving it in anything else is like serving beer in Styrofoam cups. Don’t worry, china nowadays isn’t those delicate flowery little cups your grandmother had a collection of. There are many modern, and manly, patterns and styles to choose from. Tea purists will demand their tea black, with perhaps a pinch of sugar to bring out the aromatic flavors. But for those who prefer a little milk in their tea, the “rule” is to pour the milk into the cup first, t hen add the hot tea. The tea then mixes itself, and believe me, it tastes different, although their is no scientific reason why this should be so, that I know of. Just try it. It does improve the taste. Puff the Magic Pastry and Devilish Crab Puffs The Pastry 2 cups all purpose flour 1 tsp. salt 1 1/2 cups (3 sticks) unsalted butter, very cold, cut in pieces 6 tbsp. ice water 1/2 tsp. lemon juice"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"The Quilt Inn Country Cookbook Aliske Webb © Aliske Webb 1999.

Add 4 tablespoons water and the lemon juice, and mix until just blended. Gather the dough into a loose ball, and turn onto cool floured surface. Push dough away with heel of hand 1/4 cup at a time. Repeat until all dough has been smeared. Gather into ball and add more ice water if necessary, just to make dough that barely holds together. Roll out dough to form 14x7 inch rectangle. Fold the top third down and the bottom third up with edges touching in the center—your dough is now 14x3 1/2 inches. Fold in half for a 7x3 1/2 inch rectangle and lightly seal the fold. Turn the pastry so the folded edges are on your right, and roll out again to form 14x7 inch rectangle. Fold top third down and bottom third up, again, fold in half (you now have a 7x3 1/2 ½ rectangle again) and seal. Cover with plastic wrap and place in freezer for 20 minutes. Fold down top third, fold up bottom third, fold in half, seal, and return pastry to freezer for additional 20 minutes. (It is the folding and chilling that gives the pastry a light, puffy texture.) When ready to use, roll pastry to desired thickness, cut “rounds” with cookie cutter or knife and use to line small muffin pans.

Published by Bookmice.com Grandma’s Quilt Lies on Grandpa’s Bed One of the favorite bedrooms at the Inn is on the third floor. It’s one of two large rooms converted from the attic and has three dormer windows on the East wall. There are soft white lace curtains and pink-and-green floral chintz-covered pillows resting in the windowseats. Despite low ceilings with a gambreled roofline, it’s a light an d airy spot to sit in the sunlight, sip a morning coffee and watch the world below. Nesting mourning doves coo sadly in the eaves outside. I call it the “Granny Room” although by rights it should be the Grandpa and Grandma room. There’s an antique quilt whose white background has yellowed to light amber, dark green has paled to the color of new grass and “turkey red” has faded to soft pink. It’s been repaired many times, by different hands. Sometimes well and neatly done, sometimes poorly and unevenly done. It’s not a fashionable quilt but it’s a comforting one. It’s a quilt your Grandma would have thrown on the back of her rocking chair or on a daybed on the porch, used but mostly ignored. It lies on an early rustic bed made with thick ropes that groan as you sink into the deep mattress. The bed is over a hundred years old and could tell many stories of sleepers and lovers, of births and deaths and tears, and of the dreams from pioneer homesteaders to present day homebuilders. It is massive and crude and slightly crooked. The unfinished wood has been rubbed smooth and dark by years of continued use. Our pioneer grandfathers, as sturdy young men, carved out homesteads in the wilderness across the country. They hewed and hauled logs to build homes. They built barns, drove cattle and ploughshares, and dug wells for life-giving water. They provided the basic necessities of survival—the “hardware” of walls and roofs and tables—taken from a land that was hard and sinewy as their own bodies. Grandpa carved the wooden bed. The women, as courageous and capable young women, bore and raised the children that ensured life would continue on the wide land. They made mere food into a meal, mere fat and lye into soap and candles, mere fabric into curtains, clothes and quilts that gave warmth and comfort to the family—all by her soft and civilizing hands."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"The Quilt Inn Country Cookbook Aliske Webb © Aliske Webb 1999.

All rights reserved. Published by Bookmice.com A Lifestyle in Provence We have these wonderful friends, Gail and Gerry, whose goal is to also own an Inn. Their’s will be in the South of France. We hope their dream comes true and in their honor, we include this set of recipes. It is largely on their tales of France and its beauty that we draw this inspiration. There is clearly, to those in love with this area, nothing quite like the country, the people, the smells, and the food of Provence. When Charles de Montesquieu said, “If I were King I would close all the cafes, for those who frequent them are dangerous hotheads!” we cannot believe that he was talking about the gentle people of this area, for they are far too sated (and sotted with wine) to become hotheads about anything, except perhaps defending the honneur of French chefs. Fresh herbs are an important part of Provencal cooking, which also makes it ideal country Inn fare. It is here that we learned not to cut herbs, but to tear them when using in recipes. It brings out more flavor and makes your fingers smell great! When herbs are out of season, use the f reshest and the best dried herbs you can find. A distinctive Herbes de Provence mixture can be created by combining ½ cup each of thyme, bay leaf, rosemary, summer savory, lavender, cloves and orange zest. Mix them well and store in an air tight container. And when you serve any of these dishes, try a chilled rose. Whatever you serve, remember the words of Jean Anouilh who said, “Everything in France is a pretext for a good dinner.” Salade Nicoise 4 new potatoes, baked 1 cup green beans, cut lengthwise, cooked and dried 2 ripe plum tomatoes 1/4 cup black and green olives 1 hard boiled egg 1 can tuna fish"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"The Quilt Inn Country Cookbook Aliske Webb © Aliske Webb 1999.

Published by Bookmice.com Midnight Stars Most of us these days don’t know anything about the natural world around us. Unlike our pioneer forefathers who knew all the trees and plants, all the animal tracks and could “dead reckon” by the stars, we are sadly bereft of native, natural wisdom. And we’re intimidated by it. Yet it’s easy to recapture our connection to nature. I started watching the stars long before I knew what any of the constellations were. Particularly on cold, clear Winter nights. I used to walk along a country road at midnight and listen to the different crunching noises the frozen snow would make. My footsteps echoed back from the woods until I would stop, dead still, and listen to the awesome silence. With no town lights around, I watched the deep black sky and felt overwhelmed by the millions of points of light whirling in the heavens above. More stars than grains of sand on a beach. Countless stars. Einstein said, “Not everything th at counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.” He could have been talking about stars, for all I know. When I finally started to study the stars and learn their names and the names of their constellations, I had a problem. I could never “see” or remember the constellations as they were outlined in the backyard astronomy books I read. But then I realized I didn’t have to. The constellations are really arbitrarily defined groups of stars that only appear to be related to each ot her, named thousands of years ago by Greeks and Romans who are long gone. They named them after what they knew in their lives—bears, dragons, birds, and the gods they believed were literally in the heavens. But this is the twentieth century and we have a new sky to live under. So I started my own constellation naming. When I looked at the Winter night sky years ago and saw what looked like a big bowtie, I didn’t know that it was “really” Orion. And now I don’t care because for me it is the Bowtie Constellation. And as I watched what looked like two mount ain peaks circle the Pole star in the Summer sky, I didn’t know it was Cassiopiea. I called them Cleopatra’s bosom. I have a whole catalog of constellations now. And it’s wonderfully comforting to watch “my” stars whirling around the heavens with the same predictability that reassured the ancient Greeks."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"The Quilt Inn Country Cookbook Aliske Webb © Aliske Webb 1999. All rights reserved. Published by Bookmice.com So, come to the Inn in Winter and bundle up. On cold clear Saturday nights we br ush the snow off the stone patio, set up a telescope, turn off all the lights, and red iscover the stars, again for the first time! There’s something extraordinary and magical that happens as everyone snuggles into deck chairs to stargaze. Voices drop instinctively to hushed whispers. As if we were in a hallowed space, and perhaps we are. Muffled giggles and guffaws come from under sleeping bags and quilts as people discover and share their own personal cosmology and humor. We start by rounding up all the star-pattern quilts in the Inn to keep wa rm in. There’s quite a few because they’ve always been one of my favorite traditional quilt themes. Next, everyone receives a pad of paper, a pocket flashlight and black felt pen. You can make your own star map if you like. Find and name your own constellations. Reclaim the night sky. Reclaim your connection to nature. All you have to do is be able to “see” a picture in the “dots” the stars outline, write it down and know its relative position to the Pole star. Your constellations will circle around the sky during the night if you stay up late enough, and around the sky as the seasons change. But you can always find it. Last year someone renamed my “Cleopatra’s Bosom” to “Madonna’s Bosom”. After all, it’s a new generation! Someone else “found” a ‘57 Chevy. A chemist found a molecular structure in Draco. A gardener thought Sagittarius looked more like a watering can than a teapot. A p sychiatrist would probably have a field day with this, analyzing all the subliminal transferences and projections we make when we create our own stars. But who cares? When we name something we make it ours. The poets tell us, “It’s written in the stars.” When we write our own stars, do we not write our own destiny as well? If you want to have your own star naming party, here are some ideas. Clear the snow away from whatever area you are using. Dig out all the Summer deck chairs . Line each chair with a sleeping bag or a quilt to keep the cold from everyone’s back. It’s really important to keep warm. Sitting outside at night in Winter can be unpleasantly cold and dampen the party spirits unless you prepare well in advance. Make sure everyone has a warm hat and mitts to wear. Keep feet warm too. Provide everyone with a pad of paper to draw on, black felt pens and pocket"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"The Quilt Inn Country Cookbook Aliske Webb © Aliske Webb 1999. All rights reserved. Published by Bookmice.com flashlight. Too much light around will obscure t he stars. Turn out as many lights as possible. Have a telescope or binoculars handy if possible. The moon is extraordinary in Winter and if someone has never seen it “up close and personal” it can be a moving experience. Play theme music, such as “2001: A Space Odyssey”, “Star Wars”, “The Night Has a Thousand Eyes”, “Moonglow”, or others you can think of. Serve lots of warm food, especially if anyone is planning to watch the stars until the Mo rning Star appears! Make the food simple. Finger food is best, that can be eaten with mitts on, or with mitts removed briefly. Use your discretion with alcohol. Alcohol shrinks the capillaries and restricts blood flow so people will feel colder faster when they consume alcohol, even though the first feeling is of temporary warmth, which could shorten your party. If you serve alcohol, avoid cold drinks. Serve coffee, or cocoa, lightly “laced” with alcohol, for taste. Or, use artificial extracts, such as rum, for flavor. It’s up to you.

Published by Bookmice.com What’s My Wine? It’s been a beautiful Summer here at the Inn. This afternoon I was lazing on the porch reflecting on the abundance of joy and happiness that we have shared with our guests, friends and general wellwishers, when, much to my delight, I spied an ancient Citroen huffing it’s way up the driveway. The banging of steel on steel accompanied by noxious exhaust fumes announced the arrival of our local grape-grower and vintner, Pierre LaBouche, of LaBouche Freres Winery. What a delight to see him! Pierre brought our order of wine. If you find the Inn temporarily out of your favorite dinner wine blame it in the vagaries of Pierre’s visits. He turns up whenever the spirit(s) move him. We carried cases of wine to the cellar where Pierre made his routine inspection of our wine cellar. We’ve never made it past a “B-minus” in his rating. Perhaps because we don’t stock enough of his wines! The wine cellar was never intended as such. In fact, the cellar is only under part of the house, and is really only a root cellar dug under one side of the Inn. Perhaps it was an afterthought. The rough dirt walls and massive wood ceiling beams make it an ideal wine cellar, though, with only the addition of some simple racks. After opening and sampling a robust red wine (“From the cellars directly to you, mon ami ,” Pierre said), he asked if I would like to play a little parlor game with him. “Let’s test your knowledge of wine trivia, my budding sommelier ,” he said. “And perhaps the guests of the beautiful Quilt Inn and readers of your upcoming cookbook, will benefit from this knowledge.” I readily agreed, but not before fortifying myself with some more red. “Let the game begin!” I exclaimed. 1. True or false? Wines m ade from grapes have to be aged whereas wines made from raisins do not. False. In Italy, vintners dry the harvested grapes until they are raisin–like to make Vin Santo or Recioto della Amarone. These wines need aging just as wines from freshly picked grapes do."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"The Quilt Inn Country Cookbook Aliske Webb © Aliske Webb 1999. All rights reserved. Published by Bookmice.com 2. Is red wine more fattening than white? I was prepared to put down my now almost empty glass, but Pierre hastened to assure me that the calorie content of a wine depends on its alcohol and residual sugar. A California Chardonnay, for example, at 12.5% alcohol will have more calories than a Beaujolais at 11%. “Well , Pierre. Just a touch more. Not as fattening, you know,” I said with anticipation, and no guilt. 3. Michael’s birthday arrives soon. How do you open Champagne do avoid the “pop” and a fountain? Hold the cork firmly and twist the bottle away from the cork. The cork should not move. “Here, I’ll show you,” Pierre said, having retrieved a bottle of Moet from the Inn’s racks. Sure enough, when opened the way he suggested, no pop, no foam, just a light expression of air, like the sigh you make after tasting your first sip. Which we did. 4. Are all pink wines sweet? No. Many pink wines, such as rose, are dry, especially those from the Rhone Valley, such as Tavel and Lirac. 5. The vintage date on a bottle tells you: (a) the birth year of the winemaker’s first child; (b) the winemaker’s wedding anniversary, so he won’t forget; (c) the year the grapes were picked and crushed; (d) the year the bottle was made; (e) the year t he wine was bottled. The answer is (c), although (b) would not be a bad idea! 6. How should you hold a wine glass? Oh, oh. I could hear another demonstration coming from Pierre, and of course the glasses needed to be refilled. “It’s ju st educational, mon ami ,” he said with a glow (it might have been the champagne). “Hold a wine glass by the stem or base, not by the bowl. Otherwise, you will warm a chilled white or cover up the bouquet of a red.” 7. True or f alse? Fill your wine glasses as full as possible, not only to demonstrate your generosity, but to give a better appreciation of the color of the wine. False. A wine glass should be filled only to the β level, to allow you to swirl the wine to produce a concentrated bouquet. (Also, if the glass is too full your nose will get"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"The Quilt Inn Country Cookbook Aliske Webb © Aliske Webb 1999. All rights reserved. Published by Bookmice.com wet. I think Jimmy Durante started this tradition.) 8. Pierre swore on his mother’s grave that if you sucked a warm Sauterne through a straw (Sauterne is the sweet white dessert wine from Bordeaux) you could cure your hiccups. True or false? Absolutely false. (But if you suck enough wine this way you won’t care if you have the hiccups or not!) And, Pierre’s mother is still alive, too! 9. Are dry wines with a sugar count of “0\" really dry? No wine is completely dry. There will always be some unfermented sugar in it. 10. True or false. Alsace is a German wine region. Well, this question started Pierre and I reminiscing about “The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show”, (thereby disclosing our ages), the episode where our heroes attempted to save the French wine growing region of “Applesauce Lorraine”, so it took a while to come back to the question. (Boris: “I hate moose!” Natasha: “I know you do, dollink!”) In any event, for those of you who are still with us, the answer is false. Alsace is a wine region in Northeastern France, bordering on Germany’s Baden region. It’s distinctive green, long-necked bottles resemble those of the German Mosel wines. 11. True or false. Champagne glasses should be placed wet into the freezer, to frost them so that the wine will remain as cold as possible. Oh, oh, again. Another champagne question. Sure enough, out came another bottle, accompanied by frosted glasses. What happened? The wetness kills the bubbles and makes the champagne go flat. Which brought us to the discussion of the shape a champagne glass should be. Pierre asserted that, Hollywood movies aside, champagne should always be served in a tall slim fluted glass, in order to preserve the bubbles. Mon Dieu , whoever started serving champagne in those flat-bowled stem glasses should be flogged, he tells me. The flat bowl lets the bubbles come out faster, which e xplains why the champagne served at most wedding receptions is flat by the time it’s served to you.

Well, I think it has to do with how much you have consume d, but the correct answer is to say, “Reez-ling”. 13. True or false. The longer the cork, the more expensive the wine? Strangely, true. Longer corks are more expensive and of better quality. 14. Vinho Verde is (a) the color of paint that your wife wants matched exactly at True Value; (b) a greeting used in Spanish wine bars; (c) one of the Canary Islands; (d) any Portuguese wine made from green grapes; (e) a light zingy white wine grown in the Minho region of Portugal; (f) the color of your Dad’s ‘53 Nash Rambler. The answer is (e), though (f) is probably true, too. 15. What is a Buzbag? (a) slang for too many wine samplings with good friends; (b) a Spanish wine skin; (c) a Turkish wine made from Okuzgozu grapes; (d) a parasite that attacks vine roots. (c). ‘Nuff said. 16. What are wine diamonds? Not, as one might expect, a Michelin Guide rating at a restaurant, but rather potassium bitartrate crystals that precipitate in a wine that has been chilled too quickly. They are harmless, tasteless and odorless, and in fact are a sign of quality. They show the wine has not been pasteurized and cold-stabilized, as are less expensive wines.

All rights reserved. Published by Bookmice.com Fare Weather Friends More than occasionally we have friends ov er to the Inn for dinner. This may seem like bringing coals to Newcastle but our entertaining is easily divided into those who pay us, and those who repast for free. After all, who can resist a free meal (unless, of co urse, it happens to be followed by a time-share pitch or the latest scheme in multilev el marketing). All we ask is that they bring cheerful conversation, a good appetite and that they leave behind empty plates (and the good silver). Dinner guests are strange anomalies of th e human spirit. You would expect them to be charming, appreciative and at least on time. Usually they are the first two, particularly if you are not trying to impress with a culinary coup de grace: the latest all- vinegar meal, or a mono-maniacal masterpiece from Southern California. People are so polite. They won’t say to your face that a tarte de seaweed is hardly their idea of an appetizer, let alone appetizing,or that for the fourth time, the smell of red wine vinegar precedes you into the dining room. No, they simply won’t eat. Gu ests do expect your menus to be sensible. We know that if you are particularly proud of your navigation skills around the kitchen, this may seem like an imposition. We’ve all been there. Lemon with everything, (it smells so fresh!), cream with everything, (it adds a je ne sais quoi ), garlic with everything, (at least everyone is on equal footing thereafter), and the fabulous dessert that is trotted out meal after meal because everyone thought it was great the first time. Guests should be met at least halfway. You will not impress with your ability to turn zucchini into a five-course banquet, or that you know how to recycle the shrimp from the appetizer into a soup, main course, dessert and sherbet. Nor will it help if you pre sent them with a theme dinner, (say, an all blue brunch: grape juice, blueberry cassis, blueberry pancakes, blue ice cream and a blueberry flan). When you think about your menu, ask yourself these questions: What is in season ? Then don’t serve it.

Then double it or be prepared to surreptitiously offer the local gourmet store’s version of foie gras as your own. What is the purpose of the dinner —the meal itself, background to a meeting of volunteers for a community project, romance? Is anyone allergic to anything ? Be secure in the fact that the guest will probably announce their problem well in advance. That way, you can be sure that it is indeed an allergy and not an aversion to your style of cooking. Pl an a three course meal that is easy to serve with minimal last minute attention—unless you want to spend the time in the kitchen rather than visiting. (You did invite these people, remember.) My experience is that down-home country cooking—soup or salad, meat with vegetables, and dessert—will satisfy and win over even the most critical guest. In fact, the more pretentious your meal, the more people feel they must comment on it, (often negatively behind your back). Unless you are a chef of fame and notoriety, gracefully accept the fact that the meal in all likelihood will merely be the backdrop to a sensational evening of mirth and conversation. Unless you serve ever ything flambed, people will rarely stop talking to stand and salute your culinary masterpiece. (They may be standing, nervously, to fetch a fire extinguisher.) Strike a balance in your meals and don’t expect your guests to eat as if they’ve plowed “the back forty\" before sitting down. You can lighten the load by offering a clear soup or a small salad as an appetizer, avoiding fatty or deep-fried foods and if the main course does have heft, offer sherbet instead of tiramisu for dessert. Otherwise, your guests will have to ask for small portions, (insulting to them—like you’re implying they should be on a diet), leave some of the meal hidden under the lettuce or piled in a small lump in the corner, (insulting to you), feed the dog, (....), or deposit their London Broil in th eir neighbor’s purse, (insulting, and surprising, to the neighbor). If you’re going over the top on dessert, announce your intention at the beginning of the meal so guests can adjust their intake (and belts) accordingly. Don’t be to light in your servings, though, because small portions will invariably demand requests for second helpings (thereby denying the benefits of “light” cooking). No one wants to be first for seconds. And they cause you as the host to continually jump up and do wn out of your chair as if you had a hot seat. Small servings are usually gazed upon with silence, while the guest asks herself: is this it? Or wonders whether"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"The Quilt Inn Country Cookbook Aliske Webb © Aliske Webb 1999. All rights reserved.

All rights reserved. Published by Bookmice.com When The Spirit Moves I bought the chest at an auction, much to Michael’s surprise. When we attend an auction, we normally tour the goods first and decide what we want to bid on, set a price and (try to) stick to it. So call it a whim or an insubordination, or whatever. Michael just shrugged as I started to bid. (Yeah, like he’s never come home with something we didn’t agree on. I have photos. One time he brought back and entire phonebooth! He swears it was a car phone...but that’s another story.) The chest was an eighteenth century European dowry chest. Probably French by construction, with Spanish lock and oil portraits on guache, and leather hinges. OK, so its provenance is questionable. But I’m convinced it was a steal. And if it’s a fake I don’t want to know. I’ve been close to taking it to be appraised several times. I want to find out that it’s worth thousands, just to rub it in. But I don’t dare. I call it “Lovejoy”, (named for the British television art seuth.) Michael calls it the “hope-less chest”. It’s be en living precariously in the second floor hallway opposite the stairs, beneath an antique quilt . I say precariously because it seems to be trying to move downstairs. I several times had to shift it back against the wall when I found it stuck out a foot or so from the wall. At the time I thought nothing of it, assuming someone had bumped it, or it had been moved in the cleaning. Until it kept happening and one day I found it clear across the hall at the top of the stairs. \"I know you don’t like Lovejoy, but you don’t have to push it down the stairs,\" I joked to Michael. \"What?\"\" He looked askance and dubious when I explained. The next time it moved, it was one quarter over the edge of the stair. \"That’s it,\" I told Michael. \"It’s going into one of the guest rooms.\" I rearranged furniture. At dinner, Michael said, \"I think I heard your ghost thumping around upstairs this afternoon.\" \"You could have helped,\" I pointed out archly. A week later I was showing guests to their room.

Published by Bookmice.com One Man’s Feast Several years ago when I was living in England, a friend very kindly took me on a countryside tour out of London along the Thames of Wolsey, Moore and Beckett, on a search for olde worlde pubs. There are still some original centuries-old buildings with five foot doorways, white-washed wattle and daub walls with foot-thick solid oak beams (no t veneers), and dark smokey interiors. They are pubs of good cheer, crackling fireplaces, warm beer, and deep ales. Ah, what a time we had. On that lovely Summer day, we careened merrily along narrow country roads in his beat up Citroen. Curious that. The English hate the French, except for their cars, bread and cheeses. As I found out later, the French also hate the English, except for thei r woollens. The Channel is much wider than the mere 100 miles across. It’s a wonder they ever got the “Chunnel” to meet in the middle. We sang encores of pub songs as I tried to catch glimpses of the countryside over thick hedgerows and stone walls. All of a sudden, I lurched forward against the dash as the car came to a screeching halt amid a hail of gravel and dust. Dave backed up a hundred feet and pulled into a farmyard. “Look,” he said. “Bunnies Five Pounds. I’ll cook you a delicious rabbit stew for dinner.” And out he leaped and jogged up the farmhouse steps before I could speak. I sat there converting Pounds into real money (dollars), wonde ring how much meat there was on a rabbit anyway and what that worked out to per pound per Pound. David was involved in an animated and jovial conversation with a woman on the porch. I saw them smiling as he reached into his pocket for cash. Suddenly the woman made a loud exclamation of disgust, turned back into the house and slammed the door in his face. Dave looked both bemused and peeved. “What on Earth happened?” I asked as he climbed back into the car. “No. Worse,” he laughed. “Apparently she thought I wanted the damn rabbit for a pet. She was prepared to sell me one. When I asked her if she knew the best way to skin it, s he realized I wanted to eat it and she slammed the door in my face.” He shrugged as we backed slowly out the driveway."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"The Quilt Inn Country Cookbook Aliske Webb © Aliske Webb 1999.

Published by Bookmice.com The Orchard Workmen arrived this morning and started cutting down trees in the orchard. The orchard is over a hundred years old and is surrounded in three sides by a neat stone wall. The wall is three feet high and a foot and a half wide. It is completely free standing and made without mortar and yet every the stone fits neatly into place. The wall was made by an itinerant stone mason who traveled around the county building walls to pay for his supper. This Spring, we are losing seven trees to old age and blight. They are along the East wall which is the oldest part of the orchard. It’s hard to lose one tree, much less seven. They are like grandparents, or old members of the community. They were here before we arrived and we assumed that they would be here forever. So metimes, I guess, we ignore their steadfastness until it is threatened, or gone. But we looked after our trees. Why us? Why are they gone? It feels like ponderous mortality. Seems like the tree just reaches its full productive maturity, and then it is gone. Like people. We work and grow and learn all we can to be productive mature members of our community, then we too, are gone and others take our place. Tree sentimentality see ms to be an attitude I brought from a city childhood. Perhaps because in the city there are so few trees, and we are so removed from them and green, growing life. We long for trees like missing relatives and desperately hold on to the pathetic concrete shrouded survivors on downtown streets. Here in the country where trees and green life abound there is a different perspective. Rather than a maudlin sentimentality, there is a simple respect for life, and its ebb and flowing nature. In the nursery, saplings are thinned to make room for healthy full sized plants. Not every plant will survive, if they all try to. A fruit tree must be pruned to make healthier growth next year. In the orchard, an old diseased tree is removed so that it doesn’t infect the others. In the light and space it leaves behind, a new young and vigorous tree is planted, ensuring a nother generation will grow up and continue to be a productive orchard. And the remaining old trees shade the young trees from the heat of Summer and the cold winds of Winter until they are strong enough to stand alone. The myriad"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"The Quilt Inn Country Cookbook Aliske Webb © Aliske Webb 1999. All rights reserved.

One day, President John Kennedy was conferring with his garden er about a new tree that was to be planted. Wanting to produce quicker results for the President, the gardener explained to Kennedy that the species of tree he had chosen was a very slow growing variety that would not reach maturity for one hundred years. Perhaps he would like to choose another? But Kennedy’s inimitable answer was, “Then we have no time to lose. The tree must be planted today!” Michae l and I were going to drive into Clareville tomorrow, to Johnson’s Nursery. But I think we’ll go this afternoon, instead.

I can’t think of any other name that would have evoked such feeling and storytelling as quilting has. Even for those who have never picked up a nee dle. Everyone , it seems, has a quilting story to tell. Many are eagerly and proudly told. Some are reluctant and sadly shared. All are precious memories. A neatly dressed middle-aged woman recalled quilting with her grandmother at a local church bee. Grandma was such a perfectionist that after he r friends went home, she would pull out any less-than-perfect stitches and redo them. She never told her friends she did so. She loved them too much. And she quilted for the companionship. The woman learned lessons of love from her Grandma. A young woman with long unruly hair remembered her spinster aunt teaching her to quilt as a young girl. The little girl accidentally left a knot on the top of the quilt and wanted to take it out so not to ruin the aunt’s quilt. No, the aunt said, leave it in. That way when I run my fingers over the top and feel the knot, it will remind me of you. The young woman learned about loving acceptance and the poignancy of memory from her aunt. An older woman recalled that her mother worked in a cotton mill during the Depression. Each night she was given a half yard of new cloth to clean down the machines. Instead of using the new piece, she kept it and took it home. She used another old cloth and washed it over and over again, secretly taking it back in to work with her every day. From all the new pieces of cloth she made clothes for the family, and wonderful scrap quilts for the less fortunate—at least she had a job to f eed her family. The woman learned about resourcefulness from her mother, and has committed her life to helping others. A t eacher of remedial reading classes for children took a quilting class at a local quilt shop. She had never done anything like this before. All the other women in class seemed better and faster at learning than she was. “This is how my students feel in normal classrooms,” she realized. The teacher learned heartfelt compassion and"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"The Quilt Inn Country Cookbook Aliske Webb © Aliske Webb 1999. All rights reserved. Published by Bookmice.com patience from her own awkwardness. “I don ’t remember ever seeing my Grandma quilting but I know she did,” an other woman looks inward for memories. “I remember her baking though and smelling brownies coming from the oven. I’d be in a rocking chair on the porch, reading Nancy Drew novels, wrapped in a quilt. She would bring out cookies and milk just when there was not enough daylight left to read and say, ‘Don’t strain your eyes, dear.’ That was our signal. I’d close the book and we’d sit and talk, eat brownies and rock. I don’t know what we talked about. Anything and everything, I guess.” Every story is told the same way, with far off distant looks as the teller relives the tale. Every story is of women, irrepressible creativity, and love. Two of the most comforting things in life: a quilt and chocolate. I suppose if you’re on a diet you have to forgo this chapter. Go wrap yourself in a quilt and you’ll feel better.... We have t o thank the Aztecs for discovering the coco bean and all its intoxicating glory. It w as considered to be food fit only for the gods and consumed only by the pivileged, and was tantamount to religious ecstasy. It is also puported to be an aphrodisiac. Montezuma apparently drank up to 50 cups of it a day. (Unfortunately th e Aztecs also sacrificed virgins by throwing them into deep wells. What a waste.) The Belgians took chcolate to its decadent heights by moulding it into decora tive shapes. The Swiss, in an effort to keep warm on long snowy nights, melted it into milk and drank it, or melted in a fondue and dipped everything in the kitchen into it. The English invented the chocolate candybar itself, and finally the Americans packaged and marketed it to the masses. Chocolate is n ow a ten billion dolla r industry annually. Every year, the average per capita consumption of chocolate is ten pounds! Well, I know I don’t eat ten pounds of chocolate every year. In fact, no one I know does. At least none of us will admit it.

Chocolate is great (but my all-time favorite flavor is raspberry ) so I only make chocolate for special occasions that way I continue to appreciate its flavor. When Michael wants to really send me into paroxyms of delight, he brings me raspberry-filled dark chocolate and I’m putty in his arms. When I serve chocolate for guests, I want them to stand up and salute it. So the recipes I look for and use need to be different and unusual and spe cial, like the ones that follow: In any of these recipes, here is a handy substitution you can use: 1 square (1 ounce) semisweet chocolate = 3 tbsp. unsweetened cocoa powder plus 1 tbsp. vegetable shortening or oil 2 squares (2 ounces) semisweet chocolate = α cup semisweet chocolate chips This is for sentiment only.

Published by Bookmice.com Canned Laughter Once month a television crew from the local station, KORN-TV, arrives at the Inn, accompanied by “Aunts” Ivy and Millie, who are local media celebrities. They like to use our library to tape some of their TV programs. The library has wide-plank wood floo rs, tartan-patterned wallpaper and one whole wall of book shelves. Over the fireplace are framed eighteenth century hunting scenes. There’s a leather so fa and plaid wingback chairs with good reading lights that are comfortable enough to invite you to curl up with a good book, but straight enough to keep you from falling asleep. It’s a very masculine-looking, “lord of the manor” sort of room which makes an interesting backdrop for these two grey haired ladies’ “fireside chats.” Aunt Ivy and Aunt Millie are good friends who have agreed to disagree on everything. If one likes hot weather, the other prefers cold. If one votes liberal, the other votes co nservative. If one is logical, the other is chaotic. If there are two sides to anything, these two will find them. And they’ve made a name for themselves by playing “point-counterpoint” on their program. “Canning” TV shows always reminds me of my Grama and the crock of pickles she inevitably had aging in the “Summer kitchen” out back, and the jars of jams and relishes that were lined up on an old hutch. Michael and I both grew up in a climate that had short Summers, followed by what seem ed to be an interminably long, cold and snowy Winter. Therefore, the growing season was short, and the depths of January were always brightened by savoring the fruits and vegetables which had been carefully nurtured in June, July and August. So, we don’t mind the heat when it comes. We like to say that we are storing it up for the Winter, the better to melt the snowdrifts that sta nd between us and our dormant garden. Here at The Quilt Inn, the seasonal swing is not as pronounced, but it still calls for “putting up” fruits and vegetables , the better to remember the Summer growing season. There are other reasons as well. What you prepare at home and serve has less salt and sugar, and relies more on the natural tastes and textures than does “store"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"The Quilt Inn Country Cookbook Aliske Webb © Aliske Webb 1999.

At The Quilt Inn, in the orchard, you see peach, plum, and pear trees, a single nectarine and an apricot. Apple trees with many varieties are there too. There is also a farm garden, which produces abundant quantities of beans, cucumbers, fresh herbs, tomatoes, the ubiquitous zucchini, corn, squashes, and more. We have raspberries, strawberries and blackberries. And we can pick wild blueberries down the path by the barn. Here are some of our favorite “canned sunshine” recipes.

It’s been in our family for a long time. I think it was my great-grandmother’s. Now, before you think it is valuable or something let me tell you this is a very beat up copy. In fact, the original cover was lost years ago and as long as I can remember it’s been held together by the very beaten up cover of another (lost) book called, Heart Songs . As a little girl I misread the tile and always thought it said “Hearth Songs”. Somehow that seemed appropriate. A cookbook would contain songs from the hearth. Isn’t that what Shakespeare was alluding to when he wrote, “If music be the food of love...”? Unlike Elena Molokhovets’ book about pre-Revolutionary aristocratic excesses, Mrs. Palmer’s book is a plain, down-to-earth anthology of everything a North American homemaker at the t urn of the century needed to know. It included everything from dressing game, to preserving food, to baking pies and making ice cream delicacies. For extra value in the over 500 pages, there are chapters on cooking for an invalid, how to run a nursery, how to make soap, perfumes and cosmetics, and remedies for common ailments, my favorite. So, before we become too nostalgic for the good old days, here are some of the invaluable (and sometimes unbelievable) cures you might want to try. To Stop Bleeding “Apply wet tea leaves, or scrapings of sole leather to a fresh cut and it will stop bleeding, or apply a paste of flour and vinegar.” To Stop Bleeding at the Nose “Bathe the feet in very hot water, drinking at the same time a pint of cayenne pepper tea, or hold both hands above the head.” Toothache “The worst toothache, or neuralgia coming from the teeth, may be speedily and delightfully ended by the application of a bit of clean cotton saturated in a solution of"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"The Quilt Inn Country Cookbook Aliske Webb © Aliske Webb 1999.

Sometimes the late sufferer is prompted to momentary laughter by the application, but the pain will disappear.” (Try suggesting this to your dentist!) Relief From Asthma “Sufferers from asthma should get a muskrat skin and wear it over their lungs with the fur side next to the body. Or, soak blotting paper in saltpeter water, then dry, burning at night in the patient’s bedroom.” Earache “Take a bit of cotton batting, put it upon a pinch of black pepper, gather it up and tie it, dip in sweet oil and insert into the heat, put a flannel bandage over the head to keep it warm. It will give immediate relief.” Cough Syrup “Syrup of squills 4 ounces, syrup of tolu 4 ounces, tincture of bloodroot 1½ ounces, camphorated tincture of opium 4 ounces. Mix.” (I wonder where you can find squills these days?) When I think of a hearth I always think of the smell of warm loaves of bread baking. But don’t be intimidated, thinking you can’t make bread. You can! It’s im portant to refrigerate your yeast to keep it fresh, and use before the expiation date on the package. It must be dissolved in water before it is added to the flour. A key element in making a yeast bread is the gluten. This is achieved by mixing and kneading the dough (and who doesn’t knead more dough?) You knead, sorry, need to feel some elasticity in the dough and it should shin e a bit, too. Some of our recipes have different flours in them for flavor sensation, but you cannot use these special flours alone. They have very little gluten to contribute to the bread (No thanks, I gave at the flour mill). Anyway, that’s why all yeast breads use a greater proportion of all purpose flour or bread flour in relation to any other ingredients. Another point. Your relationship with bread dough is not very fulfilling. It needs time but doesn’t need you. Mix the dough and go shopping. Come back and punch it down and visit a neighbor.

All rights reserved. Published by Bookmice.com Giving Thanks My all time favorite time of the year is the Autumn. There is no time that feels healthier or more invigorating to me. I love the feel of warm, sunny Fall days when the air is crisp and clean. The faint smell of leaves burning somewhere and the sig ht of squirrels hustling, bustling and burying frantically, reminds me that the cold Winter is coming and I should relish these last warm days. Walking through the woods, kicking multitudes of splendid-colored leaves, takes me back to a carefree childhood. It’s the best time of year to fall in love, walking hand in hand through the woods. Having already given up their bounty, the fruit trees are almost bare of leaves. The last few survivors rattle forlornly in the breeze blowing through the orchard but if you cross the orchard diagonally from the Inn you’ll come to a break in the stone wall where there’s a gate into the still leafy woods and meadow beyond. In the Fall, when the sun lies slantwise across the sky, the woods seem to glow with a special dappled light especially in the late afternoon. A half a mile up the path, if you stop at the lightning blasted old oak tree stump and look to your left, you can see the ruins of a tiny stone shack. I often wonder about the pioneer who made the one room shelter. Was he an early homesteader blazing the trail into an unknown countryside? Was he a lonely “mountain man”, or was there a woman and a family there keeping him company and enduring the hardships? I can imagine Thanksgiving must have been especially meaningful to them, giving thanks for an abundant harvest that would see them through a long Winter. When you return to the Inn, check out the quilt hanging in the dining room. It’s called Autumn Splendor and is a bargello pattern design in a riot of green, gold and rust colors to capture the look of the hills and the valley around the Inn. It hangs opposite the window wall, so that it reflects the colors outside like a mirror in fabric. In Autumn, colo rs, smells and food come together in a glorious patchwork of all the sens es. Below the quilt we set a long narrow serving table decorated with rustic baskets full of orange and yellow gourds, along with juicy red apples and toasty brown nuts. A bottle of tawny Sherry and glasses stand warming by a crisp fire. Help yourself."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"The Quilt Inn Country Cookbook Aliske Webb © Aliske Webb 1999.

Published by Bookmice.com As the sun goes down, friends and f amily gather together and we serve our Thanksgiving feast at an antique rectory table that seats fourteen at a squeeze. Two hundred years later, we give thanks for our abundance and give thanks to the long gone pioneers who built the little one room stone cabin in the woods. Autumn is the time when I really enjoy making and eating soups. They make light meals yet are warm and hearty fillers after a long brisk walk. Soups usually “age” well and are even better the next day. Ne ver worry about not having stock or broth to make a soup. Many soups taste just as good with water. You can make up for the ric hness that stock adds by slightly decreasing the amount of water called for, or by adding a splash of wine. I think country soups are best served in rustic crockery bowls. Always warm the soup bowls before serving so the soup does not cool off too f ast, and you can take time to savor the flavor.

All rights reserved. Published by Bookmice.com Holiday Memories I have to admit to being real goofy about Christmas. Ever since I was a little girl, I’ve always loved the festivities of preparing for the Holiday Season. And decorating the Inn is one of the best times of the year, in anticipation of guests joining us for the festivities. The main hall is one of the most important rooms in the Inn, and yet we seem to use it more in the Winter than at any other time of the year, probably because of the large stone hearth on the North wall. The previous owners had covered in all of the fireplaces in the Inn and had used them only as decor to hold planters of ferns. We felt that such beautiful cozy fireplaces should be used so we opened them up again. In front of the fire sits one of our first, and favorite, antique purchases, a coffee table made from a well-used farm sleigh. My father recalled using just such a sleigh to haul logs from the woods in the Winter to heat the my great-grandmother’s farmhouse. It still has its original steel runners and the wood struts have been refinished to a mellow d ark wheat sheen. A modern top of half–inch thick plate glass has been added, so you can still see the whole frame and the Axminster carpet below. On either side of the fireplace are matching Hunter Green sofas and green–and–gold striped wingbacked chairs. I have to admit I chose the Hunter Green decor especially because I love how it looks at Christmas when we add pine boughs, red bows, and all the red, green and gold trimmings we’ve collected over the years. In an alcove behind one sofa we put up the tree. For years we’ve collected tree ornaments from around the country. All old-fashioned, Currier-and-Ives looking, and nostalgic. We try to find ornaments that are made from wood or cloth, and that enhance a remembrance of Christmas past, Christmas of our childhood. The main hall is really important to us for another reason. Michael and I married just before Christmas one year, and moved immediately into a large, empty house. We had nothing in t hose first days and months except a big house with wood floors, a fireplace and a few boxes of stuff. Our bed was borrowed twin beds that sat in a corner of t he living room. We went out and bought a barbecue so we could cook our first Christmas turkey."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"The Quilt Inn Country Cookbook Aliske Webb © Aliske Webb 1999. All rights reserved. Published by Bookmice.com But we had a tree. Our first tree. It had only one set of lights, a few ornaments and I made popcorn “snow” for the branches. But on Christmas Eve, we lit the fire and put our sleeping bag and blankets on the floor beneath the tree and slept on the floor that night. We kept the fire going all night and the tree lights on. We lay there watching the shadows flicker around the bare walls and wondered how we would ever fill up the big empty house. Four years later, the house was so full we started having “yard sales” to eliminate the obsessive clutter! In the morning we drank eggnog for breakfast and opened our presents. Michael gave me a bird feeder and some Classical music tapes to replace the ones I had lost. I gave him warm gloves and underwear. He’s the romantic, obviously! We’ve slept on the floor in front of a fireplace every Christmas Eve since then. Even the year we were 9½ months pre gnant and had just hosted a Christmas Eve dinner party. The guests went home, the furniture was pushed back and down went the quilts...and the three cats...and the dog...and us, Michael, me, and what was to become our son, Geoffrey. Christmas Eve is also when I decide what to add to my Christmas quilt. I have a quilt that will take me twenty-five years to complete. It has twenty-five Christmas wreaths on it and in the center of each wreath I embroider something that represents a significant even t for the year. The first was the year we married, so naturally our wedding rings are entwined with the date. I’ve also added decals and embellishments that are memen tos of meaningful events, like teddy bears and baby blocks on the wreath for the year Geoffie was born. Christmas Eve is the time when we talk over the past year, and remember. It’s when we look forward to the coming year and a shiny new future.

Along with popcorn “snow”, I like to make gingerbread “snowmen” to decorate the Christmas tree. One year, friends with a three year old son were visiting us. A week before Christmas I noticed many of the little brown men on the lower branches had lost their feet. A couple of days later they had lost various arms and legs. By the time Christmas morning rolled around, many had been reduced to dangling heads on strings. Kyle had been surreptiously nib bling on them every time he passed the tree.

Published by Bookmice.com The Quilters We didn’t have much money growing up. I never really noticed its lack. Every Summer I went to a cool small town where Grandma lived while my Dad sweated it out in the city. When I was five, I thought my Grandma was the only woman in the world who quilted. She was a magician. I watched her cut scraps of fabric and arrange the multi- colored shapes like fabric tiles in a giant jigsaw puzzle. She’d let me help sometimes if I wasn’t too fidgety. Then she would start to sew them all together. Piece by piece. It took too long so I went out to play. When I was ten, Grandma took me to the church basement where a dozen of her friends gathered around a creaky wood frame. I was surprised that Grandma had taught all these other women to play her colorful game. They sat and quickly stitched the quilt with fine straight stitches. They let me make iced tea and bring them cookies and thread their needles until my eyes were too tired and cross-eyed to see. As they talked and laughed, I went to sleep on a pile of musty smelling pillows. Grandma would wake me and I’d stumble sleepily home in the dark with her. When I was fifteen, going with Grandma was more of a duty than anything. It’s not that I didn’t love her, you know. It was just that I wanted to be out doing other things. And besides they had this real annoying habit. By then I had my own place at the quilting frame. They would just get into talking about something really interesting and juicy, when someone would clear their throat and tilt their head ever-so-slightly in my direction. Like deft jugglers they would briskly turn the conversation to something else. Walking home in the dark, pestered with my questions, Grandma never could seem to recall what they had been talking about. When I was eighteen, I was lucky to get a night job at Miller’s Dairybar to help out with college tuition. When I was sorry I couldn’t go quilting with Grandma, she said, “Don’t worry. Your education is more important. You’ve spent enough time hanging around w ith us old ladies.” Two days before I left for college, Mr Miller said, “Take tomorrow off. You worked hard all Summer,” and he gave me my last paycheque."},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"The Quilt Inn Country Cookbook Aliske Webb © Aliske Webb 1999. All rights reserved. Published by Bookmice.com Grandma didn’t seem surprised. She just said, “Good. You can come to the church with me.” We spent my last Summer evening machine quilting crib quilts for the children’s ward at the community hospital. Moving with the times, for some of the ladies, sewing machines had taken over where arthritic fingers could no longer go. That evening we talked of everything with no taboos. They listened with grace and affection to my talk of the bright future. They shared town gossip and laughed wickedly at things genteel little old ladies shouldn’t know anything about. I was appalled and tickled and pleased that I was finally included in the circle of women. As I abs ent-mindedly made iced tea in the worn and badly-painted church kitchen, I wondered if I would ever see these scandal ous ladies ever again. I didn’t know how to say goodbye to them. I had a sense and secret hope that life was going to take me off in new and exciting, and far away directions. There were whisperings and rustlings from the other room as I returned with the tray of ice-tinkling glasses. The bumpy linoleum floor was cool under my bare feet, on the late Summer eve. “We never could decide what to give you for graduation or for g oing away to college. So here. This is for you,” Grandma said. “From all of us.” She handed me a wrinkled brown paper grocery bag that was soft and limp with use. In it was a quilt. A beautiful quilt. An amazing quilt. A quilt for me. It was a fri endship quilt with a block signed by every one of them. They had worked on it all Summer. I cried and hugged them all. They, too, were saying goodbye. Goodbye, and we’ll always be here for you."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"The Quilt Inn Country Cookbook Aliske Webb © Aliske Webb 1999. All rights reserved. Published by Bookmice.com Please think about this When a person buys a paper book and loans it to a friend to read, they are recommending a good read and sharing their purchase. This is a long accepted practice in the book publishing industry - that there is more than one reader for each book purchased. Wh en a person uses a photocopier to make a copy of that book to pass to a friend, whether they know it or not, they are breaking copyright laws - not that any publisher can do anything about policing this situation. But photocopying a book is time-consuming and expensive for the copier so most people don't do it, and, most reputable instant copy shops will not copy more than a few pages of printed books because they are aware of the copyright restrictions and could well be charged if the \"customer\" turns out to be a law enforcement officer. With the ease of distribution of information on the internet and the ease of attaching files to emails, a whole new problem exists for epublishers. Unlike sharing a paper book with a friend, when a person purchases an ebook and then sends it on to a friend, they are making a copy of the ebook. In other words, two copies of the book exist where there once was only one which was originally purchased. This is infringement of copyright law. If a person sends the ebook to one hundred friends... then there are 101 copies now in existence. If those people copy and pass on the ebook... Yo u can see how this situation very quickly gets out of hand. And this is absolutely infringement of copyright law. But again, almost impossible to control or prosecute. However, the inevitable result of this internet plagiarism will be that authors and epublishers will no longer choose to make works available electronically because they will not be able to make a fair living from their works. This will mean that the only works that will be available on the internet will be books in the public domain (the same ones now available in libraries). People will not be able to read their favorite popular authors on the net. Copyright law now protects copyright for seventy years - people will soon tire of only being able to read ebooks that are over seventy years old! Ebooks are normally priced lower than traditional paper publications as a reflection of the fact that trees are not cut down to produce them and there are no high storage or distribution fees associated with them. The electronic medium is providing all of us with an exciting and powerful tool of communication and knowledge. Let's not destroy the dream of a literate global village. Please, be a responsible ebook reader."}]
