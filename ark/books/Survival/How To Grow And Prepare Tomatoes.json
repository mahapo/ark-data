It means a lot to us, and hopefully by the time you’re through reading, the feeling is mutual. This ebook is a compilation of some of the best articles/fact sheets that we have found, both in print and on the Internet. We’re guessing your first question here is, “What exactly have I downloaded?” To answer you simply ... Here you will learn: • About the life and times of one of America’s greatest inventors • How tomatoes were grown around 1918 • Many ways of utilizing the tomato in the kitchen Now, a tidbit of information on this ebook. This ebook is a gardening classic that should not be lost to future generations of gardeners. “How to Grow the Tomato” part of the ebook is the contents of George Washington Carver’s original publication concerning growing tomatoes (about1918). The “115 Ways to Prepare it for the Table” portion of the ebook was added by staff members at Tuskegee Institute. Some very good recipes in this section. Although some of the concepts that Mr. Carver put forth (it was state of the art in 1918) may not be appropriate today (e.g., use of arsenic compounds), the basic information is still valuable. The “Biographical Sketch” was added by the editors."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"NOTES FROM THE EDITORS [ Page 4 ] Copyright © 2000 | Lynn Gillespie & Glen Mentgen | All Rights Reserved Lynn’s web site: http://www.lynngillespie.com Glen’s web site: http://www.farmboys.com Code to link to our download site: This is what the link will look like: Free 59-page Ebook “Gardening Classic “ Click Here to Download! <p> <center> <font face=\"arial,helvetica\" color=\"0000FF\"> <b><big>Free 59-page Ebook <br> &quot;Gardening Classic&quot; <br> <a href=\"http://www.lynngillespie.com/download/ gardening_classic.pdf\">Click Here to Download!</a> </big></b> </center> </font> </p> and this is the snipit of code that you will install at your web site: Please share this ebook...

He assisted people of all colors because he believed that \"to bring happiness to others brings happiness to oneself.\" The final act of generosity from this quiet, resourceful, hard-working genius came in the form of his bequeath to the Tuskegee Institute: his entire savings ($30,000), garnered from his modest salary of $125 a month, which he earmarked for the study of soil fertility and continued creation of useful products from waste materials. An admittedly spiritual man who considered himself \"God's servant,\" he was once asked to speak on soil improvement to a group of poor white farmers. He gave his well-received talk at an unpainted church near Montgomery, Alabama. After his talk, some of the farmers expressed their concern about not having enough money to paint the church. A few days later, Carver arrived with pails of blue paint, and the following Sunday, the people worshipped in the church whose new color now matched the heavens! Today, Dr. George Washington Carver-the \"Wizard of Tuskegee,\" and the \"Columbus of Soil\"-serves as a wonderful role model. Our following his example of respecting nature's gifts and treating all things as sacred is critical if we wish to learn from this great champion of conservation and invention. He not only greatly expanded our economy, but his brilliant achievements enriched the earth by observing and translating its splendor. THE EARLY YEARS... George Washington Carver was born on a Missouri farm near Diamond Grove (now called Diamond), Newton County in Marion Township, Missouri. In early manhood he recalled that he was born \"about 1865\". On other occasions Carver noted that his birth came \"near the end of the war [Civil War]\" or \"just as freedom was declared.\" \"Since Missouri was not in 'a state of rebellion' at the time of the Emancipation Proclamation, slavery continued in that state until implementation of"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION GEORGE W.

Although Carver gave 1864 as his birth year in his later life, it seems likely that he was born in the spring of 1865.\" The paternity of George Carver is uncertain. He usually named his father as a slave on a neighboring farm who was killed in a log-hauling accident shortly after George was born. In contrast to his brother Jim, George was listed as \"negro\" rather than \"mulatto\" in the 1870 census. Because in Missouri, as other Southern States, slave marriages could not be legalized, and many slave women were victims of unsolicited sexual contacts. Moses Carver was the landowner who purchased a thirteen-year-old girl named Mary in 1855. Moses, and his wife Susan, Carver were unconventional in their basic opposition to slavery and their support of the Union in the decade of rising tensions that eventually cumulated in the Civil War. It is uncertain how may children Mary bore. Although the only child whose birthdate can be definitely established was Jim Carver (who died of smallpox in Seneca, Missouri in 1883), there are uncertain references to twin girls who died in infancy. Moses Carver provided a tombstone for Jim Carver with a birthdate of 10 October 1859, a date supported by the 1860 census records. The western border of Missouri was the site of considerable guerilla warfare and \"bushwhacker\" activity for the time of the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 until months after Robert E. Lee's surrender in April 1865. Throughout the war, area residents were prey to looting and killing by Confederate bushwackers, Union raiders, and ordinary outlaws taking advantage of the unsettled conditions. Moses Carver, as a prosperous slaveowning Unionist, was the target of raiders on three separate occasions. Near the end of the Civil War a group of men rode onto Moses Carver's land in search of money. Moses and Jim Carver were able to hide but Mary and the infant George were kidnapped and taken into Confederate Arkansas. The infant George was later found and traded back to Moses Carver for a $300 race horse, but his mother Mary either died or could not be found. George Carver was raised by Susan and Moses Carver."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION GEORGE W.

He knew adversity early as a young, sickly boy with a serious speech defect. Yet, against staggering poverty, his perseverance saw him through college and graduate studies to become an internationally famous scientist. He began his education in Newton County in southwest Missouri, where he worked as a farm hand and studied in a one-room schoolhouse. He went on to excel at Minneapolis High School in Kansas. Though denied admission to Highland University because of his race, Carver gained acceptance to Simpson College in Indianola, Iowa, in 1887 (1890?), studying music and art. Etta Budd, his art instructor whose father was head of the Department of Horticulture at Iowa State College, convinced him to give up a career in art and go into scientific agriculture. He received a B.S. from the Iowa Agricultural College in 1894 and a M.S. in 1896 (1897?). He became a member of the faculty of Iowa State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts in charge of the school's bacterial laboratory work in the Systematic Botany department. Carver was not only the first black to enroll as a student at Iowa State, but was also the first black to join the faculty. In 1895 he was the assistant botanist in the Experiment Station and worked there until the following year, when Booker T. Washington, founder of the Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute for Negroes, asked him to join the staff at Tuskegee Institute in Alabama as the school's director of agriculture."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION GEORGE W.

At Tuskegee Carver organized the Agricultural Department, planned the first agricultural building, taught classes in chemistry and botany and conducted research. He served as Director of Agriculture, the first Director of the Agricultural Research and Experiment Station and Head of the Department of Research. His work led to the creation of many products from peanuts and over 100 products from sweet potatoes, Alabama clay, cotton, soybeans, pecans, wood shavings, and waste materials. Carver developed his crop rotation method, which alternated nitrate producing legumes-such as peanuts and peas-with cotton, which depletes soil of its nutrients. Following Carver's lead, southern farmers soon began planting peanuts one year and cotton the next. While many of the peanuts were used to feed livestock, large surpluses quickly developed. Carver then developed 325 different uses for the extra peanuts-from cooking oil to printers ink, 108 applications for sweet potatoes, and 75 products derived from pecans. When he discovered that the sweet potato and the pecan also enriched depleted soils, Carver found almost 20 uses for these crops, including synthetic rubber and material for paving highways. He remained on the faculty until his death in 1943. Carver died of anemia at Tuskegee Institute on January 5, 1943 and was buried on campus beside Booker T. Washington. HONORS BESTOWED UPON GEORGE WASHINGTON CARVER... George Washington Carver was bestowed an honorary doctorate from Simpson College in 1928. He was made a member of the Royal Society of Arts in London, England. He received the Spingarn Medal in 1923, which is given every year by the National Association for the Advancement of colored People. The Spingarn Medal is awarded to the black person who has made the greatest contribution to the advancement of his race."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION GEORGE W.

A feature film of his life was made in Hollywood in 1938. In 1940, he bequeathed his estate to Tuskegee Institute and established the George Washington Carver Foundation to continue his work. Carver has been called the father of chemurgy. George Washington Carver was honored by U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in July 14, 1943 dedicating $30,000 for a national monument to be dedicated to his accomplishments. In 1953 the area of Carver's childhood near Diamond Grove, Missouri has been preserved as a park, with a bust of the agricultural researcher, instructor, and chemical investigator. This park was the first designated national monument to an African American in the United States. Upon his death, Carver contributed his life savings to establish a research institute at Tuskegee.

His philosophy was \"Throw nothing away, everything can be used again.\" Throughout his life he practiced the ethic of preservation, inventing the science of ersatz, or substitutes. His profound knowledge of botany, agriculture, and soil economy enabled him to devise ways of helping the people of the economically depressed South enhance their mode of living. Many knew Carver as the \"peanut man\" because he transformed this legume into a major agricultural product, but few recognized his greater achievements. Besides the 300 products he developed from peanuts and 118 products from the sweet potato, he developed many new products from waste materials, including recycled oil, and paints and stains from clay. As a scientist, Carver adapted and transformed discarded materials back into new, valuable resources, thus opening up vast possibilities for industrial expansion which would make the lives of his fellow human beings more comfortable and secure. He investigated the use of millions of tons of cellulose and lignin that were being discarded yearly, turning these waste products into invaluable materials, such as marble, wallboards, and road cover. He preached, \"Find new uses for this waste and thus enlarge the usefulness of the product for mankind.\" He found all sorts of uses for crops-from soups to nuts to milks-to new raw materials for industry. Just from the soybean he created flour, meal, coffee, breakfast food, oil, and milk. He transformed the peanut, at that time considered an insignificant crop and \"monkey food,\" into a multi-billion dollar industry providing a major source of food and medicine. Some of the products he derived from the peanut include beverages, pickles, sauces, meal, bleach, wood filler, washing powder, metal polish, paper, ink, plastics, shaving cream, rubbing oil, linoleum, shampoo, axle grease and synthetic rubber. A humble man, he sought no recognition for his numerous discoveries and contributions, and sought no patent on his therapeutic peanut oil. Amidst war and poverty, he found people in need of many things without the means of acquiring them. From soil starved of nutrients from years of cotton farming, he invented some one thousand items of food, clothing, and building material."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION GEORGE W. CARVER A SHORT BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH [ Page 12 ] Copyright © 2000 | Lynn Gillespie & Glen Mentgen | All Rights Reserved Lynn ’ s web site: http://www.lynngillespie.com Glen ’ s web site: http://www.farmboys.com Of this era, he stated: \"At no period in our history is it more important that every acre, yea, every foot of land be made to produce its highest possible yield. It is equally important that everything possible be saved for our consumption. The shortage of tin cans, glass containers, the high price of sugar as well as the containers, make it emphatic that we have some other method within the reach of the humblest citizen.\" To compensate for the lack of animal waste available as fertilizer, he used two methods of fertilizing: one was growing velvet beans, cowpeas and grass to be plowed under in the fall as a green fertilizer; in the spring he grew and plowed under wheat, oat, and rye. Through this ingenious method, fields once depleted of nutrients were revitalized and the soil became fertile once again. The basis of Carver's ideas was that nature \"has a way of evening things out\" because it creates no waste. He illustrated that the mastery of economic plant life and the maintenance of soils came from finding useful purposes of all things. He noted that failure resulted when farmers did not seize the opportunities to convert waste materials into new resources, and consequently proved his point by demonstrating that compost piles could be made with paper, rags, grass, weeds, street sweepings and anything else that decayed quickly. Carver was ahead of his time in realizing that the utilization of our environment is a part of any economic development. As we approach the millennium, there is greater recognition that economy means more than disposing and spending; conversely, a healthy economy depends on thrift and utilizing waste. No longer will greater consumption be equated with increased growth and production. Reducing waste has implications in all facets of our way of life-from how we conduct our simplest everyday tasks, to our relationships, how we eat, play and work. Carver understood this. That's why he started his laboratory with bottles, old fruit jars and any other thing he found he could use from the trash pile at Tuskegee Institute. Although numerous major industries were sparked by this American genius, his transmutation of waste into wealth has yet to be fully realized. He had a profound passion for nature, understood the importance of service to human welfare, disregarded conventional pleasures, and exhibited no interest in financial reward.

But few people realize what an important vegetable the tomato is. While, it is true that chemical analysis does not place it very high in the nutritive scale, if viewed from this angle alone its real value will be greatly underestimated. For the reasons which follow, every normal person should make the tomato a very prominent part of the weekly diet: • It is a vegetable that is easily grown. • It yields well and keeps for a long time. • It usually brings a fair price, because nearly everyone likes tomatoes. It contains distinct medicinal virtues (which are recognized by many authoritative books on household remedies), as \"vegetable calomel.\" • It is both a relish and an appetizer as well as a food. • Our soils can be made to bring enormous yields of tomatoes, superior in look, taste, and general appearance. • They can be prepared in so many delicious ways that one can eat them every day in the week and not get tired of them. • The old vines contain splendid dye-stuffs, which could be utilized as a by-product for dying fabrics of various kinds."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"PREFACE [ Page 16 ] Copyright © 2000 | Lynn Gillespie & Glen Mentgen | All Rights Reserved Lynn ’ s web site: http://www.lynngillespie.com Glen ’ s web site: http://www.farmboys.com • There are so many sizes, colors and varieties that, for garnishings, fancy soups, and especially fine decorative table effects, they are almost indispensable. • With a little intelligent effort fresh tomatoes can be produced in this locality almost the year round."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"IN THIS CHAPTER, YOU WILL LEARN: n About the selection of soil for growing tomatoes n About fertilizers to be used n How to start the tomato plant n About cultivation n How to prune plants and how to take cuttings n About dieases and insect enemies CHAPTER 1 HOW TO GROW THE TOMATO"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1 HOW TO GROW THE TOMATO [ Page 18 ] Copyright © 2000 | Lynn Gillespie & Glen Mentgen | All Rights Reserved Lynn ’ s web site: http://www.lynngillespie.com Glen ’ s web site: http://www.farmboys.com HOW TO GROW THE TOMATO SELECTION OF SOIL The tomato is not at all choice in the kind of soil in which it grows; in fact, almost any well-drained soil can be made to produce good tomatoes. However, for early ripening, it shows a preference for a light, loamy soil; and, if very early tomatoes are desired, the soil must be only moderately rich, as a highly fertile soil produces large vines and more fruit, which is likely to delay ripening of the tomatoes. PREPARATION OF THE SOIL It is most essential that the ground be spaded or plowed up very deep, harrowed and replowed if necessary, until every large clog is marshed, and the ground is fine and mellow. Do not plant tomatoes on land that has had white potatoes, melons, or tomatoes on it the year previous. Indeed, it is best to let the land rest from these crops three or four years, as all of them are subject to the same blight disease. FERTILIZERS It is a mistake to think that the tomato does not like a rich soil. Indeed, to have the best tomatoes, the soil must be rich. The plant is very partial to a soil full of well rotted vegetable matter; hence, we recommend the following fertilizers, based upon experiments carried out here on the Experiment Station grounds, which gave excellent results: Two loads of leaves from the forest and muck from the swamp were spread over the bottom of a pen; then one load of barnyard manure. This was continued until the pen was full, and rounded over at the top like a potato hill, so as to prevent the excess of water from washing out the fertilizing constituents. To this heap old rags, plaster, lime, paper, wood-ashes, finely beaten up bones, etc., can be advantageously added. Make this compost heap in the fall so it will be well rotted by spring."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1 HOW TO GROW THE TOMATO [ Page 19 ] Copyright © 2000 | Lynn Gillespie & Glen Mentgen | All Rights Reserved Lynn ’ s web site: http://www.lynngillespie.com Glen ’ s web site: http://www.farmboys.com STARTING THE TOMATO PLANT In the northern part of West Virginia and in the higher altitudes the tomato seed should be sown from the first to the fifteenth of March, but in the southern part and along the Ohio and Kanawha Rivers the seed may be sown as early as February fifteenth. The best method of starting the plants is by use of a hotbed. It may be constructed as follows: Select a well-drained location where the bed will be sheltered, preferably on the south side of a building or fence. Dig a pit 3 feet wide by 6 feet long and 2 feet deep, so that the long side faces the south. Line the inside of the pit with boards. A stake may be driven in at each corner to serve as a support for the frame, if boards cannot be obtained for the lining. Fill the pit with fresh horse manure well packed down by tramping. Construct a frame 3 feet wide by six feet long. Have this frame 12 inches high at back or north side and 6 inches high at the front or south side. Place the frame over the pit and bank the outside with strawy manure or soil. Place in the frame four or five inches of good garden loam which has not grown any diseased plants. Cover the bed with glass hot-bed sash. Unbleached muslin or cheesecloth may be substituted for the glass. The fresh horse manure is used to furnish heat for the plants. No seed should be planted until the temperature of the soil falls to 80 degrees F. If a crop of tomatoes for early market is desired, transplanting is necessary. In this case use two or three rows across the end of the hotbed for sowing the seed, and use the remainder of the bed for transplanting. Mark off rows from three to six inches apart and one-fourth inch deep. Drill in the tomato seed, about 12 seeds to the inch. Level the soil and press the surface of the bed firmly and uniformly. Moisten the ground thoroughly. During summer days ventilate by raising the cover a few inches on the side opposite the wind. Toward evening close the sash in order to get the bed warm before night. As the plants grow older the ventilation may be increased. Water in the mornings on bright days only. Keep the bed moist but not wet. Ventilate after watering in order to dry off the plants."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1 HOW TO GROW THE TOMATO [ Page 20 ] Copyright © 2000 | Lynn Gillespie & Glen Mentgen | All Rights Reserved Lynn ’ s web site: http://www.lynngillespie.com Glen ’ s web site: http://www.farmboys.com When the seedlings are about two inches high, or just before the second leaves set, transplant them two inches apart each way to another part of the bed. Another transplanting four inches apart should be made in about three weeks. If there is no remaining space in the hotbed, a cold frame, constructed similar to the hotbed except that no pit or manure is necessary, may be used. The seedlings may be transplanted to small boxes or flats about 18 inches long, 12 inches wide, and 2 1/2 inches deep and then the boxes placed in the hotbed or the cold frame. If the tomatoes are to be canned, principally, it is not necessary to hasten the maturing of all the plants. In that case the hotbed may be used without any transplanting. Mark off rows four inches apart and one-fourth inch deep. Place one seed every two inches in the row and then transplant every other seedling to another part of the hotbed or place the seeds at distances of four inches and do not transplant. Allow these to grow as they stand, until ready for the field. Before the seedlings are set in the garden plot they should be hardened off by a scant supply of water for several days and by the absence of any covering at night, when there is no danger of frost. Moisten well just before transplanting. STARTING THE SEED For a family garden, saw an ordinary cracker-box in two so that it will not be more than six or seven inches deep; nearly fill with good, rich earth; sow the seed; sift earth over them until well covered; water thoroughly, and set in a sunny window. They will soon come up and grow off rapidly. Set out doors on warm days to make them hardy, strong, and stalky. For a later planting sow out of doors, in this latitude about April 15th. SETTING THE PLANTS Lay off rows with a middle-burster or two-horse plow; put well rotted compost in drill at the rate of 25 tons to the acre; bed upon it lightly, and set the tomatoes directly upon it. Where a chemical fertilizer is used aim at the following: Cottonseed meal ------------ 800 lbs. Acid phosphate -------------- 850 lbs. Nitrate of soda --------------- 50 lbs."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1 HOW TO GROW THE TOMATO [ Page 21 ] Copyright © 2000 | Lynn Gillespie & Glen Mentgen | All Rights Reserved Lynn ’ s web site: http://www.lynngillespie.com Glen ’ s web site: http://www.farmboys.com The nitrate of soda to be applied as a top dressing. Just as the tomatoes begin to set, 250 pounds of muriate of potash is desirable, but at present it is out of the question. For this reason I strongly urge the compost. SELECTION OF VARIETIES Every year adds to the long list of varieties of the tomato. With many of these so-called varieties there is a distinction with but little or no difference. The following varieties have done exceedingly well here on our trial grounds: EXTRA EARLY VARIETIES: Spark's Earliana, June Pink, Burpee's Earliest Pink, John Baer, Prosperity, Bolgian's I. X. L., and Chalk's Early Jewel. MID-SUMMER VARIETIES: My Maryland, Greater Baltimore, Dwarf Champion, and New Stone. LATE VARIETIES: Red Rock, Acme, Livingstone's Stone. CULTIVATION Tomatoes like the soil about them kept loose and mellow by frequent hoeings, and at no time must they be allowed to become weedy, as weeds greatly injure the plants. A little commercial fertilizer or a quart of compost dug in around the vines once per month will give finer tomatoes and prolong the life of the vines. Caution-Do not use fresh or unrotted manure, as it encourages diseases of various kinds."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1 HOW TO GROW THE TOMATO [ Page 22 ] Copyright © 2000 | Lynn Gillespie & Glen Mentgen | All Rights Reserved Lynn ’ s web site: http://www.lynngillespie.com Glen ’ s web site: http://www.farmboys.com PRUNING When extra early tomatoes are desired it is important that the pruning be done properly. n Train the vine to one or two stalks. n Tie to stakes well sharpened and driven into the earth. Tie the vines securely to these stakes at frequent intervals. n Keep growing vigorously until the lower fruit is half grown; then cut off the top just above the larger fruit. This will cause the fruit to ripen several days earlier than if the top was left on. It is important to note that, as a rule, 90 per cent of the tomatoes grow within 18 or 20 inches of the ground, although the vines grow much taller; hence, the wisdom of pruning. ROOTING CUTTINGS In this locality July and August are the best time to root tomato cuttings. The tops and suckers will root readily if inserted in boxes of moist sand or moist shady places. The cutting should be 3 or 4 inches in length. Keep well watered, and they will be nicely rooted in about 9 days, when they should be taken up and set the same as for seedlings. They will begin bearing almost as soon as they begin growing well. They are preferable to seedlings. In making the cuttings half of each large leaf should be taken off. EXTENDING THE SEASON Method No. 1 .---Just before the first frost, pick the large, well developed green tomatoes, and place them side by side in a cool, dry place. Do not let them touch each other. Care must also be taken not to bruise them. Straw or dry leaves can be placed in a cold frame, and the bed filled with them. Method No. 2 .---Pull up the whole vine, fruit and all; hang the vines top-downward in a cool, dry place. In this way, nice ripe tomatoes can be had until Christmas, New Year, or even later."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1 HOW TO GROW THE TOMATO [ Page 23 ] Copyright © 2000 | Lynn Gillespie & Glen Mentgen | All Rights Reserved Lynn ’ s web site: http://www.lynngillespie.com Glen ’ s web site: http://www.farmboys.com FUNGUS DISEASES The most serious diseases affecting the tomato in this locality are these: Leafspot Diseases. ( Septoria lycopersici).---This trouble covers the leaves with minute brown specks, after which they turn yellow and fall off, causing the plant to die outright or become unfruitful. Remedy ---Spray the plants as directed with the following mixture just as soon as the first signs of the disease appear. Bordeaux Mixture By F. E. Meyers & Brothers Copper Sulphate (blue vitriol)-------------4 lbs. Quicklime (not air-slaked)-----------------4 lbs. (Of dry air-slaked lime or hydrate of lime one-fourth more). Water to make----------------------------- 50 gals. Dissolve the copper sulphate by putting it in a bag of cheese-cloth and hanging this in a vessel holding at least 4 gallons, so that it is just covered by water. Use an earthen or wooden vessel. Slake the lime by addition of a small quantity of water, and when slaked cover freely with water and stir. Strain the milk of lime thus made into the copper sulphate. Pour more water over the remaining lime; stir and strain into the other until all lime but stone lumps is taken up, and then add sufficient water to make 50 gallons in tank. Thoroughly agitate mixture, when it will be ready to apply. The mixture should be made fresh before using, and any left over for a time should be thrown out or have fresh lime added. The above is the 4-4-50 formula. Can be used up to 6-6-50 just before bloom on apples or potatoes. The above is for rots, molds, mildews, and all fungus diseases. BLACK MOLD ( Macrosporium tomato) This disease attacks the tomato itself, beginning at the blossom end. Tomatoes with rough skins and crushed ends are more likely to take the disease than the smooth skinned varieties; hence, the wisdom of selecting smooth skinned varieties. Fruits that lie upon the ground and those grown in dense shade are affected worst; which emphasizes the importance of staking the vines and pruning so as to let the sun in."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1 HOW TO GROW THE TOMATO [ Page 24 ] Copyright © 2000 | Lynn Gillespie & Glen Mentgen | All Rights Reserved Lynn ’ s web site: http://www.lynngillespie.com Glen ’ s web site: http://www.farmboys.com ANTHRACNOSE ( Colletotrichum phomoides) This is another very destructive disease of the fruit. Treat the same as for black mold. TOMATO WILT ( Sclerotium Rolfsii) This is a very troublesome disease to many plants, and one of the worst the tomato grower has to fight. Symptoms ---It makes its appearance similarly to the cotton wilt and frequently destroys whole fields within a short time, if neglected. (a) It is worst during wet, cloudy weather. (b) Coarse, unrotted manure encourages its growth. (c) Planting too thick so the sun can't get to the soil. It is easily recognized by a fine white mold just above the ground, later this mold is followed by great masses of white and brown seed- like bodies-by this time, however, the plant is hopelessly involved. Remedy ---Avoid the use of (a), (b), (c); and since the disease appears just at the surface of the ground, it is wise to scrape the earth away quite to the large roots, keeping it away during wet weather. All vines should be staked up off the ground. As soon as the earth dries out to good growing conditions of moisture, return the earth about the roots. A liberal amount of wood ashes with the soil seems to have proven beneficial. FUSARIUM WILT ( Fusarium lycopersisi) BACTERIAL WILT ( Bacillus solanacearum) Both of the above diseases at times are quite troublesome, and work within the plant, making sprays of all kinds useless. The best remedy to date is: 1. Good clean seed, free from blight. 2. Rotation of crops. This same disease attacks tobacco, eggplants, and peppers; therefore, do not let your tomatoes follow these crops. Keep them off these infested areas for at least three years, five years would be better. BLOSSOM-END ROT OR POINT ROT This is a very destructive disease of the fruit, appearing as a dry, black spot, starting at the blossom end."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1 HOW TO GROW THE TOMATO [ Page 25 ] Copyright © 2000 | Lynn Gillespie & Glen Mentgen | All Rights Reserved Lynn ’ s web site: http://www.lynngillespie.com Glen ’ s web site: http://www.farmboys.com Remedy ---It appears worst during dry, hot seasons; hence, we recommend absolutely clean cultivation and a dust mulch all the time, to encourage both the using and saving of the moisture. FRUIT ROT, SOFT ROT, ETC. (Phoma destructiva Plowr) This disease is destructive to both leaves and fruit, causing a spotting, and if neglected, will cause them both to drop off. Remedy ---Spray with Bordeaux mixture. INSECT ENEMIES There are at present only a few insect enemies of the tomato that cause much concern in this locality: 1. The \"tomato worm,\" the \"corn ear worm,\" the \"boll worm,\" etc. This insect often does serious damage by boring into and destroying the small green tomatoes, in fact, it is the corn-ear worm of the North, and the cotton-boll worm of the South. Remedy ---Plow all corn land in the fall as the insects winter over in the ground. Pick off, and destroy the punctured tomatoes. Cultivate frequently and keep the plants growing. COLORADO POTATO BEETLE This beetle is often very troublesome, but can be held in check or completely exterminated by poisoning with Paris green or arsenate of lead. SPHINX CATERPILLAR, \"HAWK MOTH,\" ETC. This insect makes the large, obnoxious green worm, so common on tomato vines. Hand-picking is the best remedy, but spraying with arsenate of lead or Paris green will kill them. ARSENATE OF LEAD Arsenate of Soda-----------------------4 ounces Acetate of Lead-----------------------11 ounces Water--------------------------------3 to 5 gallons"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1 HOW TO GROW THE TOMATO [ Page 26 ] Copyright © 2000 | Lynn Gillespie & Glen Mentgen | All Rights Reserved Lynn ’ s web site: http://www.lynngillespie.com Glen ’ s web site: http://www.farmboys.com Dissolve the ingredients separately each in one gallon of warm water. Mix and pour into spray tank containing from 50 to 100 gallons of water. Add the milk of lime from two or three pounds of freshly slacked lime. This is the most satisfactory mixture of any for the formula. It is more adhesive than Paris green, and if properly made of good materials will burn foliage but little, no matter what strength is used. In some respects the commercial brands on the market are more satisfactory than the home-made product. For most purposes three pounds of the commercial product, arsenate of lead, in 50 gallons of spray are used. Either water or Bordeaux mixture may be used as the carrier. PARIS GREEN Paris green may be used with Bordeaux mixture at the rate of one pound in from 100 to 150 gallons. It may be used alone in water in the same proportion with two or three pounds of freshly slacked lime added to prevent burning of the foliage. The mixture should be kept well stirred."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"IN THIS CHAPTER, YOU WILL LEARN: n 115 ways to prepare tomatoes for the table CHAPTER 2 115 WAYS TO PREPARE IT FOR THE TABLE"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2 115 WAYS TO PREPARE IT FOR THE TABLE [ Page 28 ] Copyright © 2000 | Lynn Gillespie & Glen Mentgen | All Rights Reserved Lynn ’ s web site: http://www.lynngillespie.com Glen ’ s web site: http://www.farmboys.com 115 WAYS TO PREPARE IT FOR THE TABLE As before stated there are but few garden vegetables from which such a large number of attractive, wholesome, and nutritious dishes can be made, and it is hoped that the large number of recipes given below will encourage the housewife to serve this choice vegetable many times during the week, and each time the consumer consider it a luxury.
