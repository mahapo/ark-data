Kennedy, 1962 The aims, objectives, and methods of guerrilla warfare differ greatly from those of conventional warfare. To be successful in countering this type of war, the planners of counterguerrilla operations must understand the enemy and the unique environment in which he operates. This manual provides commanders and staffs of brigade elements and below with concepts and doctrine concerning the conduct of counter- guerrilla operations by US forces in insurgency and conventional conflict environments. It provides a general overview of US counterin- surgency strategy and the impact that strategy has on counterguerrilla operations. It provides planning, training, and operational guidance for commanders and staffs conducting counterguerrilla operations. The doctrine provides principles to guide the actions of US forces conducting counterguerrilla operations. In applying these principles, the commander must be aware that the situation in each counterguerrilla operation is unique. Techniques and tactics applied successfully in one situation may not be suitable if applied in the same manner in another situation. The principles in this manual are guides to be adapted to each counterguerrilla situation. The proponent of this publication is HQ TRADOC.

This chapter discusses the type of activity that is characteristic of an insurgency. A general overview of insurgency is provided to introduce the planner of counterguerrilla operations to the insurgent. The host government’s method to defeat the insurgency is discussed, as is the difference between counterinsurgency and counterguerrilla operations. The methods of response by United States (US) forces, and the general doctrine for their use, are also presented. 1-2. Types of conflict. a. The risk to national survival is greatest in a conventional conflict, but the probability of such conflicts occurring is relatively low. On the other hand, the risk to national survival is not as great in a counterinsurgency conflict, but the probability of these types of conflicts occurring is much greater. b. Conventional conflicts imply a state of open belligerency between nations and a direct confrontation of their armed forces. An insurgency implies a situation where a country is threatened by an internal attempt, frequently assisted by external support, to overthrow the legitimate government. counterguerrilla situations faced by US forces are likely to occur in an insurgency environment, but may also occur in conventional conflict environments. Counterguerrilla operations in support of a conventional conflict (such as the partisan operations that occurred behind German lines during World War II) are discussed in Chapter 4. Section Il. Insurgency 1-3. Concept. a. The concept of resistance applies to an organized effort by some portion of the civil population of a country to resist, oppose, or overthrow the existing government. Many of the methods of resistance are part of the stock-in-trade of revolutionary activity. There can be no revolution without a resistance movement, but there can be a resistance movement without a revolution when the objectives of the resistors do not envision a reallocation of power. 1-1"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 b. b. This concept applies to an organized insurgent movement that seeks to overthrow the established government. In this manner, an insurgent organization can be considered a type of resistance organization. 1-4. Prerequisites. There are three requirements that must exist before an insurgency can occur. a. Vulnerable population. For whatever the reasons — social, political, or economic — the population is generally open to change. The insurgents will offer hope for change and exploit dissatisfaction with the current government. Leadership available for direction. A vulnerable population alone will “not support an insurgent movement. There must be a leadership element that can direct the frustrations of a dissatisfied populace along the lines delineated by the overall insurgent strategy. c. Lack of government control. Lack of government control may be real or perceived. The greater the control the government has over the situation, the less likely are the chances for insurgent success The opposite is also true: the less control the government has, the greater is the chance for insurgent success. 1-5. Other required conditions. There are a number of other conditions that must exist or be produced for an insurgent movement to succeed. a. b. c. d. e. Popular support. Support can be passive or active. It is not necessary that the entire population actively support an insurgency, but the majority of the population must passively support it. Unity of effort. The overall thrust of an insurgent movement must provide a strength of unity that dedicates those involved to achieving the same goal. Will to resist. It is not enough for the population to resist their government passively; at least a portion must be willing to resist actively. Leadership. The activities and effort of the insurgent movement must be properly directed through the exercise of effective leadership. Discipline. The aspect of the movement must be strongly maintained to ensure security and obedience. 1-2"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 f. Intelligence. Because the insurgent movement is usually inferior in numbers and combat power in relation to government forces, the intelligence effort must provide security for the insurgent organization and information to conduct successful operations. g. Propaganda. It is used to gain popular support and intensify the populace’s dissatisfaction with the government. h. Favorable environment. This includes attitudes of the people, the political environment, and the economic situation. i. External support. The preceding eight conditions are theoretically the only ones that an insurgency must have to succeed. Historically, however, there seems to be one additional condition that must exist the condition of external support. This support may be physical or psychological. Examples of physical external support are equipment, weapons, supplies, ammunition, sanctuaries, personnel, and combat units. Examples of psychological external support include the political support given to the resistance when a country recognizes that movement in the world arena and the pressure a government might exert politically or economically to influence world opinion in favor of the movement. 1-6. Insurgent organization. An insurgent organization may have both an overt and a covert element. The overt element, the guerrilla, is readily identified. It is supported by a clandestine element which makes up the insurgent infrastructure. The insurgent organization also has political and military structures. 1-7. Phases of development. a. Once an insurgent organization is established and begins its activities, it progresses through several phases in its effort to overthrow the government. When the insurgency moves from one phase to another is difficult to determine. The activities that occur in the earlier phases will continue through the later phases. These phases range from the weak insurgent movement until the time the insurgent can confront government forces directly. b. There is also the possibility that an insurgency may move directly from Phase I to Phase III. Additionally, depending upon the lack of success of the movement, there may also be a reversion from Phase III to Phase II or even back to Phase I. (1) Phase I: Latent and incipient insurgency. Activity in this phase ranges from subversive activity that is only a potential threat to situations in which frequent subversive 1-3"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 incidents and activities occur in an organized pattern. It involves no major outbreak of violence or uncontrolled insurgent activity. The guerrilla force does not conduct continuous operations but rather selected acts of terrorism. (2) Phase II: Guerrilla warfare. This phase is reached when the insurgent movement, having gained sufficient local or external support, initiates organized continuous guerrilla warfare or related forms of violence against the government. This is an attempt to force government forces into a defensive role. As the guerrilla becomes stronger, he begins to conduct larger operations. (3) Phase III: War of movement. When the guerrilla attains the force structure and capability to directly engage government forces in decisive combat, then he will progres- sively begin to use more conventional tactics and may obtain combat forces from an external source. He may also begin to conduct more extensive defensive operations in this phase to protect the areas he controls. c. The goal of the insurgent movement, if achieved, will result in the replacement of the established government with a government structure developed by the insurgent movement. If this occurs, it is a political victory for the insurgents. The insurgent movement does not need to defeat host country forces to accomplish this. A parallel or “shadow” government may also be developed by an insurgent force. It must, however, win the support of the people away from the established government to achieve this political victory. Section Ill. Counterinsurgency 1-8. Three target groups. The government’s weapon to combat insurgency is counterinsurgency (COIN). The COIN mission includes a full range of measures used by a government to free and protect its society from subversion, lawlessness, and insurgency. They are actions taken by a nation to promote its growth by building viable institutions (political, military, economic, social) that respond to the needs of the people. There are three target groups that the government addresses: the population, insurgents, and external actors. 1-9. Population. The government must win back the support of the people. It does this through providing them security and showing an honest effort to correct those conditions which caused dissatisfaction. 1-4"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 1-10. Insurgents. a. The government must isolate the insurgent from the population, both physically and psychologically, thereby denying him personnel, materiel, and intelligence support. b. The COIN strategy is based on the concept of balanced development, mobilization, and neutralization. These three components are interdependent and must occur simultaneously. If COIN strategy achieves its goal, the government will regain populace support. c. The military assists the COIN program through the conduct of six major operations: intelligence, psychological operations, civil affairs, populace and resources control, advisory assistance, and tactical operations. The successful employment of these operations contributes to the success of the COIN program. They are normally conducted simultaneously, in conjunction with each other, and require close coordination of diverse government agencies. 1-11. External actors. Current insurgencies target on external actors for support, passive or active. Both the government and the insurgents use this tactic. The insurgent tries to separate the government from its foreign support. The government seeks to retain its support and separate the insurgent from his foreign support. 1-12. Counterinsurgency — counterguerrilla. There is a difference in the terms counterinsurgency and counter- guerrilla. The internal defense and development (IDAD) program is geared to counter the whole insurgency. It does this through alleviating conditions which may cause insurgency. This program, which addresses both the populace and the insurgent, can be termed counterinsurgency. Counterguerrilla operations are geared to the active military element of the insurgent movement only. To this end, counterguerrilla operations are viewed as a supporting component of the counterinsurgency effort. Section IV. Foreign Internal Defense 1-13. US assistance. a. All civil military action by a government to assist a host government and to achieve a standard level of protection from lawlessness, subversion, and insurgency is termed foreign 1-5"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 internal defense (FID). The United States (US) Army has been assigned a major role in providing military assistance to selected nations in support of US national interests. The degree of participation by US Army units is determined by US policy and interests, an analysis of the insurgent threat, and the capabilities and desires of the host country’s government. b. The introduction of US combat forces into an insurgency to conduct counterguerrilla operations is something that is done when all other US and host country responses have been inadequate. US combat forces are never the first units into a country. They are normally the last. Preceding them is an array of advisors, security assistance forces, mobile training teams, combat service support units, and combat support units. Combat commanders deploying to conduct counterguerrilla operations should understand this and the fact that neutralization of the guerrilla is only one-third of the COIN strategy. Balanced development of the country and mobilization of the populace against the insurgents must occur simultaneously for the insurgency to be defeated. 1-14. US activities. a. When deployed in FID operations, US forces ensure that their planned activities support the goals and consequences of the host country’s COIN program. Actions by US forces must not undermine or be detrimental to COIN goals. b. The response of US forces in any given situation must meet the following requirements: (1) Be appropriate — response is appropriate to the level of threat and activity. (2) Be justifiable – actions taken are justifiable in the eyes of the host country’s population and the US public. (3) Use minimum force — the goal is to restrict the use of force and the level of commitment to the minimum feasible to accomplish the mission. However, the principle of minimum necessary force does not always imply minimum necessary troops. A large number of men deployed at the right time may enable a commander to use less force than he might otherwise have done, or even to avoid using any force at all. Commanders must, however, keep in mind that a peaceful situation could become hostile because of the provocative display of an overlarge force. Doing too much may be a greater danger than doing too little. (4) Do maximum benefit – US forces should select operations so they accomplish positive benefit for the population. If this 1-6"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 is not possible then the operational concept is wrong and should not be executed. (5) Do minimum damage – US forces ensure that operations preclude unnecessary damage to facilities, activities, and resources. Since this is almost an impossibility, compensation for any damage to property must be made and the property restored, as much as possible, to its original state. In any case, a major consideration is to plan activities to limit damage. Section V. AirLand BattIe and Counterguerrilla Operations 1-15. Challenges. AirLand Battle is the Army’s operational concept for combat. It is designed to deal with the worldwide challenges the Army faces. The four basic challenges to the Army are the battlefield, leadership, readiness, and training. The basic concepts of AirLand Battle doctrine can be applied to counterguerrilla operations. 1-16. The battlefield. The Army faces an enemy that may strike from any direction. It must contend not only with military considerations in this environment but with the political, economic, and social considerations which may oftentimes outweigh military considerations. The Army must be able to operate in all geographical areas and climates, and on all types of terrain, with only the weapons, tactics, and assets permitted by the political, social, and economic environment. The enemy will strike at weak points and seek to avoid direct combat. 1-17. Leadership. The complexities of counterguerrilla operations place a premium on informed and trained leadership and independent operations. These conditions demand more leader expertise and the ability to operate independently at lower command levels than do higher levels of conflict. The leader applies skill, imagination, and flexibility. He effectively leads his troops and helps them to understand the problems of counterguerrilla operations. He must be willing to reorganize his assets to better accomplish his mission. 1-18. Readiness. Units tasked to conduct counterguerrilla operations are prepared to deploy and operate on short notice. Each soldier is prepared for battle 1-7"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 and is able to perform his duties. Units train to operate in areas of the world where they may be tasked to fight. 1-19. Training. a. b. Training is the cornerstone for success and a full-time job for commanders. The commander ensures that soldiers are proficient in traditional, basic skills and also familiar with more complex skills required for success in a counterguerrilla environment. These skills include intelligence, civil affairs, populace and resources control, psychological operations, and advisory assistance. AirLand Battle concepts outline the principles the Army must apply when engaged in combat. Combat operations based on this doctrine seek to locate, harass, and neutralize the guerrilla force and deny it the capability to conduct offensive actions by severing its linkage with the population. Coordinated efforts of military and civilian organizations are required to achieve the overall objective. 1-20. Operational concepts for AirLand Battle. a. b. Generally, the purpose of military operations is to defeat the opposing force. The use of armed forces in a counterguerrilla role is primarily to provide enough internal security to enable the host country to initiate counterinsurgency programs and pursue national objectives. The final resolution will not be by military means, but by political, social, and economic action. With this in mind, successful military operations are a means to an end. Success in combat depends on the basic tenets of AirLand Battle doctrine: initiative, depth, agility, and synchronization. (1) Initiative. To preserve the initiative, subordinates act independently within the context of the overall plan. The overall attitude of the Army is one of action, not reaction, to the enemy’s initiatives. The characteristics of improvisation, initiative, and aggressiveness, tempered with intelligent and prudent decision-making, must be strong. (2) Depth. This refers to time, distance, and resources. The commander is able to operate overlarge areas with minimum logistical support while retaining the ability to react to unexpected attacks. This battle-in-depth is designed to delay, disrupt, or destroy the guerrilla’s uncommitted forces and base areas. Reserves are kept to a minimum to allow maximum use of the force, while still retaining the capability to meet most threats. 1-8"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 (3) Agility. This requires flexible organizations and leaders who can quickly adapt to changing situations. The factors of mission, enemy, terrain (and weather), troops (available), and time (available) (METT-T) and the way they interface with environmental considerations determine the type of organization involved. The leader is innovative and flexible, and he adapts to different situations. Mobility enhances the agility of the force engaged in counterguerrilla operations, but the force is not tied to its vehicles. At a minimum, the force has mobility equal to that of the guerrillas. (4) Synchronization. This means more than coordinated action to achieve maximum combat power. In the counter- guerrilla environment, it encompasses the effective, coordi- nated use of available combat power and its interface with noncombat operations. Tactical and nontactical, civilian and military, host country and US force operations are coordinated and supportive of each other to achieve the overall objective. Additionally, US military operations are aligned with US policy and aims in the host country. This in turn may place certain restrictions on US forces. 1-21. Combat imperatives. a. The seven combat imperatives of AirLand Battle doctrine find their basis in the principles of war. These imperatives are: (1) Ensure unity of effort. The principles for this imperative are the objective, unity of command, and simplicity. Unity of effort requires the commander to understand the overall US objective and how his operations support that objective. He applies the principles underlying this imperative in such a way that the effects of his operations are not a detriment to attaining the overall US objective. (2) Direct friendly strengths against enemy weaknesses. The principles for this imperative are maneuver and surprise. The commander minimizes and protects his weaknesses and uses his strengths against the guerrilla’s weak points. To do this, he knows the enemy’s organization, equipment, and tactics. In addition to knowing how the guerrilla fights, it is important for the commander to understand why the guerrilla fights. (3) Designate and sustain the main effort. The principles for this imperative are mass and economy of force. The Army cannot be everywhere at once. It cannot do everything at once. Priorities are set at tactical and operational levels to determine where the main effort is to occur and what goal is to be achieved. 1-9"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 (4) (5) (6) (7) Sustain the fight. The force may have to operate for extended periods on limited logistics. To sustain momentum, the commander deploys forces in adequate depth and arranges for service support when needed. The commander is audacious and presses soldiers and systems to the limits of endurance. Move fast, strike hard, and finish rapidly. The principles for this imperative are maneuver and mass. Speed and mobility are essential. To avoid detection, US forces employ deception techniques, communications security (COMSEC), and operations security (OPSEC). While the overall conflict may be prolonged, the tactical operations are executed with speed to retain initiative and freedom of action. This is balanced against the need for patience. Use terrain and weather. The guerrilla force is familiar with the terrain and comfortable with the climate. Recon- naissance and intelligence (if accomplished effectively) give the commander a decisive edge in anticipating difficulties with terrain and weather. He uses both to his advantage. Protect the force. Successful commanders preserve the strength of their force. They do so through security, keeping troops healthy and equipment ready, and by sustaining discipline and morale. The guerrilla seeks to degrade the morale of the force through the use of psychological operations (PSYOPS) and harassment. His tactics are geared to wear down his opponent’s will to fight. The commander trains his soldiers and constantly reminds them of exactly what the mission is and why it is important to complete the mission. b. Doctrine is a guide that delineates principles and fundamental concepts. The commander uses these principles and concepts when analyzing the situation and then uses them as a guide in selecting his actions. 1-10"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 CHAPTER 2 The Threat Section I. General 2-1. Operations. a. The guerrilla must be understood before he can be defeated. This chapter discusses the characteristics, tactics, and environment of guerrilla operations. b. The guerrilla is the overt combat element of the insurgent organization. The members of the guerrilla force are organized under military concepts to conduct military and paramilitary operations. Their duties usually include all the overt actions that are conducted by the insurgent organization but may include covert and clandestine operations. They are usually most active in insurgent-controlled or contested areas. However, when the insurgency calls for operations in government-controlled areas, the guerrilla may conduct these operations. 2-2. Aims and goals. a. b. c. d. e. Support overall goal of the insurgent movement. To this end, the guerrilla operates to support the major goal of the insurgent movement to replace the established government. Gain support for insurgent movement. The guerrilla tries to gain support for the insurgent movement through propaganda, coercion, and terror. If he cannot gain active support, then he will seek passive support: Silence on the part of the populace concerning insurgent activities is considered passive support for the insurgent. Increase population’s vulnerability. Through the use of selective terrorism, the guerrilla attacks or destroys economic and political symbols upon which the government is founded. Overreaction on the part of government forces or other elements of authority contributes to the population’s dissatisfaction with the government and its subsequent support to the insurgency. Lessen government control. By defeating small government forces and striking where government forces are not, the guerrilla adds to the perception that the government cannot or will not provide security for the population and its property. This adds to the perception that the government cannot control the insurgents. Provide psychological victories. To this end, the guerrilla seeks to gain victories that psychologically benefit the insurgent 2-1"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 movement, whether or not these victories are significant in terms of material damage to the government or its armed forces. It is the psychological advantage the guerrilla seeks. f. Tie up government resources. By forcing the government to expend resources on military operations against the guerrilla, the guerrilla seeks to tie up resources that could best be utilized by the government in development programs. g. Weaken resolve of government military forces. By defeating smaller elements of the government’s military forces, the guerrilla further weakens the usually limited assets the government has available. He also psychologically weakens the government forces’ resolve to continue waging war. Section Il. Environment 2-3. Factors. The environment that the guerrilla operates in must be examined from more than a geographical point of view. While terrain and climate are important factors, the political, sociological, and economic aspects of the environment take on added importance. 2-4. Terrain. The rural guerrilla will prefer to continue to live in his own home. He will go to camps if security does not permit him to live at home. He favors level, well-drained campsites with good water supply, natural fuel, cover, and adequate vegetation to provide concealment from aerial observation. The preferred camps are also chosen with a view toward easy access to the target population, access to a friendly or neutral border, good escape routes, and good observation of approach routes used by government counterguerrilla forces. When counterguerrilla operations by government forces force the guerrilla out of his preferred base camps, he tends to establish camps in rugged inhospitable areas not easily penetrated by government forces. 2-5. Climate. The fact that the guerrilla is usually a native to the area and is used to the climate gives him an added advantage. If the government forces are also familiar with this type of climate, then the advantage to the guerrilla is lessened. If the government forces are not familiar with operating in the climate, then the advantage to the guerrilla increases. Generally, the climate of the area does not favor either the guerrilla or the government forces to any great degree unless there are extremes involved. Then the impact is on the logistical systems. 2-2"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 2-6. Political factors. The amount of government control in a given area directly impacts on the ability of the guerrilla to operate. The more government control, the less successful are guerrilla activities, whereas less government control of an area improves chances for guerrilla success. The guerrilla will attempt to disrupt normal government functions and destroy key government facilities and personnel to reduce the level of government control in an area. 2-7. Sociological factors. The more fragmented a society is, the greater the opportunity for dissatisfaction among the populace. The guerrilla will attempt to increase friction between different groups in society. These groups may be aligned along racial, ethnic, religious, or social lines. Language differences or tradition may also be a reason for alignment. Religious influences may play a significant role in the sociological factors that affect the guerrilla. 2-8. Economic factors. Low standards of living and desires for economic reforms may be popular causes of dissatisfaction with the government. As with political and sociological factors, the greater the degree of dissatisfaction with the government’s economic policies, the better the guerrilla’s chances for success. The guerrilla seeks to exploit this situation through the use of psychological operations. Since the guerrilla derives a major portion of his logistical support from the local economy, he will normally not disrupt it drastically. Guerrilla forces will destroy a local economy of an area as a lesson to the people living there to exact more support or obedience from them. 2-9. Impact. a. The impact that each of the factors has on the guerrilla, and his ability to successfully operate, changes in each situation. A careful analysis by the commander and his staff of each of the factors is necessary to determine what the impact of each is prior to conducting counterguerrilla operations. In all cases, each factor must be analyzed to determine the peculiarities, weaknesses, and strengths it may have in relation to the guerrilla. b. In planning for counterguerrilla operations, the commander exploits disclosed guerrilla weaknesses and deprives the guerrilla, wherever possible, of any opportunities to exploit government weaknesses. 2-3"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 Section Ill. Characteristics 2-10. Considerations. a. By understanding the general characteristics of the guerrilla, it is easier to determine strengths which must be reduced or avoided and weaknesses which can be exploited. b. The characteristics discussed are general, and the commander planning counterguerrilla operations must analyze a particular situation to discover how these considerations apply. 2-11. Guerrilla strengths. a. Intelligence. The intelligence networks in the infrastructure usually provide continuous and current information on government force dispositions, strengths, weaknesses, and capabilities. The need for secrecy as an element of survival for the insurgent organization makes government penetration and disruption of these intelligence networks difficult. However, their structures are vulnerable to penetration and careful, detailed analysis. Intelligence collecting and analyses must be placed on a robust footing early to build data bases. Pattern analysis and other techniques can rob the guerrilla of this advantage. counterguerrilla forces can also overcome this intelligence advantage through the comprehensive use of deception, operations security, and communications security. b. Indigenous characteristics. (1) Guerrillas usually have the ability to blend with the local populace. In many cases they are part of the local populace. This enhances their capability to operate with secrecy in a given area. (2) The counterguerrilla force must identify the guerrilla and remove him from the civilian populace. This is best accomplished through the effective use of population and resources control. (3) Care must be taken to ensure that civilians are not injured or mistreated as a result of counterguerrilla operations. c. Knowledge. (1) The guerrilla’s knowledge of the local populace and terrain is a strength. It gives him the ability to utilize psychological operations effectively. The guerrilla can usually develop a working relationship with the populace because they identify to some degree with his cause. If he cannot persuade them, he has the force to coerce them. The counterguerrilla 2-4"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 d. e. f. g. force must try to overcome this advantage by fostering a strong relationship between the government forces and the populace. The creation of a local civilian defense force by the government and the counterguerrilla force’s cooperation with it is one way to do this. (2) By knowing the environment he operates in, the guerilla has a major advantage. This advantage may be overcome by continuous counterguerrilla operations in a given area by a permanently stationed counterguerrilla force and skillful use of native assets. Motivation and discipline. The guerrilla leaders are trained and motivated. They reinforce motivation within the guerrilla force through the immediate application of discipline. Usually, the guerrilla is devoted to a cause almost to the point of fanaticism. Limited responsibilities. The guerrilla usually does not have the responsibility to maintain normal governmental obligations toward society. This frees all his efforts to conduct operations in support of the insurgency goals. However, the guerrilla force may be tasked to perform certain political services (such as tax collection) by the insurgency shadow government. Tactics. The guerrilla can utilize a broad range of tactics, from terror and sabotage through conventional warfare. This enables him to escalate or deescalate antigovernment activity almost at will. Physical condition. (1) Guerrillas are usually of an age which places them in their years of greatest physical stamina. One of the major advantages the guerrilla has is his ability to endure hardship. Usually, because of the situation, he has to make do with less. This forces him to adapt and be innovative. (2) The general strengths described are designed to provide a base to analyze the specific guerrilla threat. No two guerrilla forces are identical. These strengths are applied against the specific situation being addressed. Whatever the results of that analysis, the obvious strengths must be reduced or circumvented. 2-12. Guerrilla weaknesses. a. Limited personnel and resources. The guerrilla normally lacks the personnel and the logistics to intentionally become decisively engaged with government forces. Difficulty in recruitment and resupply to replace his combat losses in 2-5"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 personnel and materiel may limit his operations. The counter- guerrilla force should exploit these weaknesses by interdicting supply routes and facilities, forcing desertion because of hardships; and by inflicting combat losses that are hard to replace. b. Individual factors. Basically, the guerrilla endures a life of physical danger and privation. These stresses can be exploited by counterguerrilla forces. Numerically inferior to the government forces facing him, fear of being treated as a criminal if captured by the government, and fear of violence to himself and his family (imposed by the guerrilla organization to ensure his cooperation) are stress factors in addition to constant combat and a hostile environment that weaken guerrilla resolve. In some societies, good treatment, pardon, protection, food, shelter, and participation in the government may be stronger incentives than the fear of criminal punishment to induce guerrilla desertions. c. Operational factors. Operational weaknesses may include security, which requires extensive resources and slows down responsiveness; bases that are difficult to acquire and operate; and the lack of technology or ability to maintain captured high-technology items. The dependence of the guerrilla on popular support is also a weakness, since if that support wavers or is withdrawn, then the guerrilla will not be able to operate effectively. Another operational weakness may be the lack of sophisticated communications, which could require the guerrilla to spend an excessive amount of time preparing to launch an operation. 2-13. Guerrilla support. A major concern common to all guerrillas is support. Support can be divided into two general categories. a. Popular support. (1) As discussed previously, the guerrilla must have either the active or passive support of the populace to succeed. Popular support alone will not ensure the success of guerrilla operations. Ineffective operations, unwise decisions, and poor leadership are examples of deficiencies that would preclude his success. Popular support should be viewed, instead, as a condition that must exist for the guerrilla to initiate and conduct operations in a given area over a period of time. If popular support does not exist or is withdrawn, the guerrilla will not be able to conduct operations with any hope of success. Therefore, one of the prime considerations for the counterguerrilla force is to gain and maintain the support of the populace. Areas where active support is given to the 2-6"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 (2) guerrilla are excellent targets for psychological operations. Populace and resources control operations will play a vital role in winning support away from the guerrilla. In areas where only passive support is given to the guerrilla, then government efforts through psychological operations and civil affairs, as well as the provision of security, must be initiated to gain active support and trust of the government. In areas that the government controls and where the populace supports the government, increased emphasis is placed on all six major operations in IDAD to maintain that support. b. Logistical support. (1) This is one of the guerrilla’s most vulnerable areas. In early operations, the guerrilla relies on his base of popular support for logistical requirements. As the guerrilla force develops and expands, its logistical needs may increase to the point that the internal support base can no longer provide for all of the guerrilla’s logistical requirements. If the insurgent movement has not reached the point where the attainment of its overall goals is imminent, then the guerrilla may have to receive additional logistical support from another source. (2) If the guerrilla receives support from external sources, then he is faced with the problem of security for supply lines, transport means, and storage facilities. External support should not be considered a prerequisite for the initiation of counterguerrilla operations. It is an additional factor that, if present and effective, will enhance the capabilities of the guerrilla. In any case, the counterguerrilla force should seek to interdict the logistic support that the guerrilla is receiving, whether it be internal or external. (3) Since the guerrilla operates along military lines, he will usually have temporary sites for headquarters, installations, facilities, and operational units. These temporary sites are called guerrilla base camps. It is in these camps that the guerrilla has his command posts, training areas, communi- cations facilities, medical stations, and logistics centers. The guerrilla may also use these camps for rest, retraining, and reequipping. (4) It must be understood that these camps do not equate with conventional force operational bases since the guerrilla does not seek to defend them if they are discovered. They are temporary and depend on secrecy for their existence. If discovered, the guerrilla will usually abandon the site and move his operation. These bases are kept small, and usually 2-7"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 there is more than one base in the guerrilla’s area of oper- ation. (5) Characteristics of a base camp area are: (a) Cover and concealment. The guerrilla will attempt to locate base camps in areas where cover and con- cealment provide security against detection. (b) Rough, inaccessible terrain. Usually, the rougher the terrain, the less likely is the chance of being surprised by government forces. Terrain is chosen to provide security against detection. Key terrain, as seen by the conventional force, is usually avoided. While guerrillas avoid defensive combat, they emphasize short-term defensive action in the base camp vicinity to aid evacuation, if necessary. (c) Suitable for bivouac. The area selected is a suitable bivouac area. Consideration is given to food and water supply, grade or slope of terrain, access to trails, and protective environment. (d) Remoteness. Base camps are usually in relatively remote areas for security. To preclude accidental discovery, base camps are not usually near inhabited areas. However, because the guerrilla must be able to fill his logistical needs, his base camp usually will not be more than one day’s march from a village or town. If the counterguerrilla force can locate and disrupt these camps, then the guerrilla can be kept off balance and on the run, allowing the counterguerrilla force to gain the initiative. Section IV. Tactics 2-14. Terrorism and harassment. a. When guerrilla forces first become operational, they usually engage in limited or small-scale activities and operations. If they reach more sophisticated levels of organization, equipment, and training, then larger operations utilizing more conventional tactics may be expected. b. Guerrilla tactics are characterized by elusiveness, surprise, and brief, violent action. These tactics in the early phases can be divided into terrorism and harassment. (1) Terrorism. The guerrilla may use terrorism if it fits a given situation and accomplishes his goals. Terrorist techniques include bombings, assassinations, kidnappings, threats, 2-8"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 mutilation, murder, torture, and blackmail. It must be recognized that all guerrillas do not use terrorism as a tool. If terrorism is utilized, it is usually for coercion, provocation, or intimidation. (a) Coercion. This is used to persuade individuals to act favorably in given situations toward the guerrilla or the insurgent movement. As an example, terrorism might be used to persuade a local mayor to revise policy concerning the guerrilla. (b) Provocation. This is used to provoke an overreaction on the part of government forces so that the population will be alienated by government forces’ actions. Targets are usually government soldiers, leaders, or policemen. (c) Intimidation. This is used to modify behavior. Usually, threats or fear of harm, either to the individual or his family and friends, are used. Intimidation can be used to induce the populace to silence or noncooperation with government forces. It is used to discourage competent citizens from accepting critical low-level governmental positions. (2) Harassment. (a) Most guerrilla operations are offensive, not defensive. There is seldom an attempt to seize and defend objectives for any length of tome. (b) The guerrilla uses dispersion during his movements, but near the target area, small guerrilla elements mass and then conduct operations. (c) While the guerrilla is outnumbered by government forces, he seeks to attain local numerical superiority. In this way he can attain victory over small elements of the government forces. These tactics, if successful, compel government forces to commit larger elements to defensive tasks. Once government forces move to the defensive, they lose the initiative and become reactive. This allows the guerrilla time and space to develop to a point where he has the capability to engage larger government forces with more conventional tactics. (d) The most common techniques employed by the guerrilla are the ambush, raid, and small-scale attacks. These techniques are usually targeted against security posts, small forces, facilities, and lines of communication. 2-9"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 (e) Harassing tactics are utilized to keep government forces on the defensive. If successful, they make government forces react to guerrilla operations, taking away the government’s ability to conduct offensive operations that would prevent successful guerrilla operations. (f) Harassing tactics are also effective in weakening the government’s resources and disrupting lines of com- munication. One advantage of harassment is the perceived image it gives of the guerrilla being able to strike anywhere at will. It also makes the government appear ineffective and incompetent by continuously losing small battles. 2-15. Mao’s principles. The principles of guerrilla tactics have been stated by China’s Mao Tse-Tung: • Enemy advances, we retreat. • Enemy halts, we harass. • Enemy tires, we attack. • Enemy retreats, we pursue. 2-10"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 CHAPTER 3 Counterinsurgency Operations Section I. General 3-1. Different conditions. a. As described in chapters 1 and 2, the nature of counterguerrilla operations differs from the conditions most soldiers expect to face in combat. The counterguerrilla commander faces an enemy whose objectives, tactics, and concepts are usually different from his own. b. This chapter examines the role of tactical counterguerrilla operations in relation to the COIN program. In addition, it discusses planning considerations and principles for the successful conduct of counterguerrilla operations, as well as related operations that the counterguerrilla force must be acquainted with. 3-2. US role. The most common role in which US forces will conduct counter- guerrilla operations will be as a foreign internal defense (FID) force. The FID is designed to support the host country’s national objectives and COIN plan. Two of the primary considerations for the FID commander are the final goals of the host country COIN program and how to coordinate his operations to support hose goals. Section Il. Considerations 3-3. FID operations. a. Most US forces conducting counterguerrilla operations will be part of an FID force. The commander must understand how FID operations support the host country COIN plan. In this sense, the goals of the host country COIN plan become the goals for the FID force and the counterguerrilla commander. b. The primary consideration when planning counterguerrilla operations is the effect operations will have on the populace. Commanders must attempt to win the active support of the population for the government. At a minimum, counterguerrilla activities must eliminate incidents which the guerrilla may exploit in his psychological operations. 3-1"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 3-4. Support of coin. a. US forces committed to FID in the host country have a dual mission. First, they must defeat or neutralize the guerrilla militarily so the host country government can begin or resume functioning in previously contested or guerrilla-controlled areas. Second, they must support the overall COIN program by conducting noncombat operations to provide an environment where the host country government can win the trust and support of its people and ultimately become self-sustaining. Both aspects of the COIN mission are of equal importance and are usually conducted simultaneously. b. A common mistake made by FID forces when trying to gain popular support is that they sometimes win popular support only for themselves. The commander must ensure that popular support, in the end, is for the host country government. Credit for successful campaigns against the guerrillas, or programs to help the people, should go to the host country government and not to the FID force commander. 3-5. Purpose of tactical operations. Tactical counterguerrilla operations are conducted to reduce the guerrilla threat or activity in the area, and to provide a favorable environment for the host country’s development program. These purposes are complementary. When the guerrilla threat is reduced, internal development can begin, and when internal development works, the causes of dissatisfaction which gave rise to the insurgency are alleviated. This deprives the guerrilla of both popular support and a reason for fighting (which he needs to survive). 3-6. Planning considerations — METT-T. a. Mission. (1) Foreign internal defense operations fall into six areas: (a) Intelligence operations. (b) Psychological operations. (c) Populace and resources control operations. (d) Military-civic action. (e) Tactical operations (both strike and consolidation). (f) Advisory assistance. (2) The combat brigade is most often concerned with tactical operations, but because of the nature of counterguerrilla warfare, a specific tactical operation or campaign will 3-2"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 probably involve elements of the five other operations to some degree. The commander’s guidance for counterguerrilla operations is more detailed and comprehensive than for more conventional operations and must accommodate all operational aspects inherent in brigade counterguerrilla operations. (3) Before receipt of a specific mission, the commander’s guidance and subsequent planning is based on all probable missions, to include supporting consolidation operations or conducting strike operations, as well as on the specific characteristics of the guerrilla, terrain, and population in the specific operational area. After receipt of the mission, his guidance becomes more specific and includes the extent to which the brigade will become involved in each of the six areas of FID operations. b. Enemy. When evaluating the guerrilla capabilities and limitations, the commander considers: (1) National and regional origins. (2) Organization, to include effectiveness and unity of command. (3) Strength, morale, and status of training. (4) Tactics being employed and tactical proficiency. (5) Capability to attack, defend, and reinforce. (6) Resources available: (a) Food and water. (b) Arms, ammunition, demolitions, fuels, medicines, and neclear, biological, chemical (NBC) protective equipment (agents, detection devices, and employment assets); external support — personnel, materiel, and morale. (7) Leaders and their personalities. (8) Relations with the civilian population. (9) Status of supplies. (10) Effectiveness of communications. (11) Effectiveness of intelligence and counterintelligence, to include the extent of infiltration of host country civil and military establishments. (12) Lines of communications. (13) Vulnerabilities. (14) External support. 3-3"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 c. Terrain and weather. When evaluating the effects of terrain and weather on counterguerrilla operations, the commander considers: (1) Effects of seasons of the year (to include planting and harvesting periods), phases of the moon, and coastal tides. Particular attention is focused on the effects of the weather on men, equipment, visibility, and mobility (on both US forces and the guerrilla). (2) Suitability of terrain (to include landing zones and pickup zones) and road nets for tactical and logistical operations. As with weather, particular attention is focused on the effects the terrain has on men, equipment, visibility, and mobility (on both US forces and the guerrilla). d. Troops and resources available. (1) The commander has a variety of combat, combat support, and combat service support assets at his disposal. These assets may be from US forces and civilian agencies, or from host country forces and civilian agencies, or from a combination of all these. (2) Successful counterguerrilla operations depend upon the commander utilizing his available assets to maximize their strengths and minimize their weaknesses. To do this, the commander realistically appraises the capabilities and limitations of his assets and then organizes and employs them on suitable missions. Oftentimes, the commander finds he lacks assets which would greatly facilitate mission accomplishment. In these instances, he should request what he needs from his higher headquarters. If his needs cannot be met, he has the option of improvising a solution or doing without. (3) The peculiar circumstances of counterguerrilla warfare require that senior commanders allow subordinate leaders, at all levels, a great deal of flexibility in accomplishing their missions. e. Time. (1) Time is relative. The conditions leading to the development of the insurgency did not appear overnight, and they will not disappear overnight, either. (2) US forces involved in FID operations should anticipate staying in the host country only as long as required to complete their mission. Usually, this will only be as long as it takes the host country forces to assume missions the counterguerrilla force is accomplishing. No matter how 3-4"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 (3) (4) (5) 3-7. a. b. c. successful FID forces are militarily, the insurgency is not defeated until the political, economic, and social problems which led to it are corrected or significantly alleviated. This usually takes a considerable length of time. In the area of tactical operations, time available for planning and execution varies. When planning for long-term actions, such as consolidation campaigns, a long lead time is necessary to permit planning in meticulous detail. However, when planning shorter term actions, such as strike campaigns or offensive operations against fleeting guerrilla targets, planning time is usually short. Commanders at all levels can use the time available to them more efficiently by planning for contingency missions. Lack of hard information precludes planning in detail, but routine tasks common to similar missions should be codified in standing operating procedures (SOP) and understood by all concerned. When the need to execute a contingency mission arises, the basic plan can be reviewed and planning expedited by making minor adjustment as required. Planning time is often extremely limited. Warning and operation orders are normally issued orally. In these instances, the one-third rule applies: the commander utilizes one third of the available time for his own planning and allows two thirds of the available time for his subordinates to develop their plans and issue their orders. In many cases, planning time will be so limited that formal planning is precluded. In these instances, commanders direct their subordinates by using fragmentary orders. Restrictions. US forces engaged in counterguerrilla operations function under restrictions not encountered in other types of warfare. These restrictions may appear to hamper efforts to find and destroy the guerrilla. For example, the safety of noncombatants and the preservation of their property is vitally important to winning them over to the government’s side. The guerrilla knows this and will attempt to capitalize on it by engaging US forces at locations where US fire would endanger civilians or damage their property. While the temptation to return fire may be great, a few dead or injured enemy will in no way compensate for the ill will of the local populace if some innocent civilians are killed or injured or their homes and property destroyed. Political considerations influence the conduct of counterguerrilla operations. It is essentially a contest between the host government 3-5"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 and guerrillas concerning political, social, religious, or economic issues. The government and its representatives must present themselves and their program as the better choice. d. Commanders must be prepared to operate in a broad range of political atmospheres. The host country’s form of government may be anything from an absolute, and not too benevolent, dictatorship to a democracy struggling to establish itself, or anything in between. e. No matter what political atmosphere prevails in the host country, the brigade commander must engage the guerrilla with every asset at the commander’s disposal. He must realize that democratic principles may not be immediately applicable. However, he should act within the limits of his authority to improve the circumstances of the government he was sent to support. Any incidents of deep-rooted corruption, gross inefficiency, or violation of human rights should be documented and reported to higher headquarters. The commander can also offer other alternatives to accomplish the same objective. It is the respon- sibility of the US Government to influence the host government’s attitude toward democratic principles; it is not the responsibility of the commander. f. There will be situations where well-defined responsibilities in a local area may not be readily apparent. It is the duty of the higher headquarters to determine these responsibilities and make them known prior to the insertion of US forces, especially in the execution of strike missions. However, there maybe eventualities in which the counterguerrilla force commander may be required to coordinate with numerous governmental officials to locate sources of authority and decision. If the commander encounters government officials who habitually hinder operations against the guerrillas through incompetence, self-interest, or suspected sympathy for the guerrilla cause, he should document his case and forward it to the next higher commander for disposition. 3-8. Operating principles. a. Intelligence. Tactical intelligence is the key to defeating the guerrilla. It provides the commander with information about guerrilla locations, activities, strengths, weaknesses, and plans which enable the commander to seize the initiative. Without intelligence sources, the chances of success (particularly in offensive operations) are limited and the commander must react to guerrilla initiatives rather than controlling the situation in the area of operations. Every relevant source of information about the commander’s area of operation should be exploited and include: 3-6"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) The brigade intelligence section (and augmentation): (a) Ground surveillance radar (augmentation from division). (b) Ground sensors (augmentation from division). (c) Long-range surveillance unit (augmentation from division). (d) Aviation assets (augmentation from division). (e) Aerial imagery reconnaissance (from corps). The maneuver battalion’s intelligence section and recon- naissance platoons. The maneuver companies’ sightings and reports (combat information). Combat support units’ target acquisition batteries, military police, chemical reconnaissance units (if available), and sightings and reports (combat information). Combat service support units’ sightings and reports (combat information). Other sources: (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) (g) Local populace. Intelligence agents (from division and corps). Host government civilian agencies. Captured enemy documents (from division and corps). Enemy prisoners (from division and corps). Intercepted enemy communications (from division and corps). Special operation forces. b. Tactical situation. The organization for, and conduct of, counterguerrilla operations is dependent on the tactical situation. Units are organized and employed to counter the current guerrilla threat. For example, if guerrillas are operating in platoon-size units, then platoon- or company-size units are used against them. These units conduct independent operations such as patrols and ambushes, under centralized control (company or battalion). This enables them to cover more area simultaneously than a larger unit and still have the firepower to deal with the typical guerrilla unit they might encounter. Employing a large force to counter a significantly smaller guerrilla force is inefficient because it compromises the chance of achieving surprise, reduces the area 3-7"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 that can be covered at any one time, and is more difficult to move (than a smaller force) if it is required elsewhere. However, sending a small force to counter a significantly larger guerrilla force may prove disastrous unless the smaller force is supported by fire or can be rapidly reinforced. c. Flexibility. Forces engaged in counterguerrilla operations are flexible and capable of adapting to rapidly changing tactical situations. The nature of counterguerrilla warfare necessitates being able to make swift transitions from large to small unit operations; to adjust to extremes of terrain, weather, and visibility; to move on foot, by vehicle, or by aircraft; and to function in offensive or defensive modes. Adapting to changing tactical situations keeps the guerrilla force off balance and prevents it from developing effective tactical operations. d. Mobility. (1) Counterguerrilla forces most possess mobility equal to or greater than that of the guerrilla in order to find, fix, fight, and pursue him. Since the guerrilla is primarilly footmobile, counterguerrilla forces equipped with motorized, mechanized, or air transportation assets would appear to have a significant mobility advantage. However, the guerrilla typically operates from terrain that precludes (or severely limits) speed on a ground approach. The counterguerrilla force’s mobility advantage may not be as great as it first appears to be. When terrain, weather, or the guerrilla force disposition precludes closing on guerrilla positions by high-speed air or ground transport, then counterguerrilla forces should be moved by the fastest available transportation to the nearest suitable, safe area to launch footmobile operations. A well-trained, footmobile counterguerrilla force, that can use terrain better than the enemy, can achieve a tactical mobility advantage. (2) Commanders should not overburden soldiers with excessive loads because the guerrillas will be able to outrun them. Soldiers should carry only the things they need to find and fix the guerrilla. Once this is accomplished, they can be resupplied by ground or air. e. Minimum use of force. (1) Only the minimal firepower needed to accomplish a given mission is employed. If US forces come under guerrilla fire, and if by returning fire noncombatant civilians maybe injured or their homes and property destroyed, then only the amount of fire necessary to protect US forces is returned. Under these circumstances, the commander attempts to suppress the guerrillas with minimal return fire (possibly 3-8"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 using snipers) and moves his forces to advantageous positions from which he may engage the guerrillas while not endangering civilian life or property. He may use smoke and, if authorized, riot control agents to facilitate maneuver. If the guerrillas cannot be engaged without endangering civilian life or property, the commander moves his forces (over covered or concealed routes) to positions that cut off their escape routes and encircle them. Then he begins to tighten the ring around them. (2) The unrestricted use of firepower in the vicinity of civilians or their property will result in turning their anger toward the government and may turn them to the insurgent cause. US soldiers must understand this and follow strict rules of engagement. However, the right to self defense is never denied. (3) All available fire may be brought to bear on guerrillas when it does not endanger civilian life or property. However, the expenditure of ammunition should be appropriate: mortars to knock out a machine gun position; small arms to kill a sniper. The use of indirect fire, while effective in some cases, is not a substitute for maneuver. f. Patience. Counterguerrilla forces must anticipate long periods without making contact. The guerrilla knows he is outnumbered and outgunned and avoids engagement unless it is on his terms. Counterguerrilla forces should not develop a false sense of security if it appears the guerrilla has ceased operations in their area. It must be assumed that the guerrilla is always observing the operating patterns of the counterguerrilla force for weak points, and waiting for lax security to strike with minimum risk. A guerrilla attack must be expected at any time. g. Reserves. (1) The commander always maintains a reserve to take advantage of sudden opportunities, and to counter guerrilla initiatives. The size of the reserve depends on the size of its parent unit and the tactical situation. (2) In offensive operations, a company might keep a squad in reserve; battalions, a platoon; and brigade, a company. (3) In defensive operations, because of the need for 360-degree security, a reserve at company and battalion is complicated by the fact that the on-line strength of the perimeter is reduced. (4) The company or battalion commander may have to spread his forces thin to protect his perimeter. In these instances, the commander has four options: establish a small, centrally 3-9 160-739 - 94 - 2"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 (5) (6) (7) located reserve at the expense of on-line strength; establish no reserve but specify units on-line to be prepared to shift a portion of their strength to other sections of the perimeter; establish no reserve but reinforce the most heavily contested section of the perimeter by fire; and consider reducing the size of the perimeter. Brigades too should maintain a company in reserve in defensive operations. This mission should be rotated among companies, with the company that has spent the most time in the field (or that has seen the heaviest action) being designated as the reserve. The reserve company can rest, rearm, and train during the time it has the reserve mission. The reserve unit should be highly mobile. Air transport is the preferred method for moving the reserve because it is fast and not dependent on open ground routes as are motorized or mechanized modes of transport. Whatever its mode of transportation, the reserve’s vehicles are dedicated to the reserve and immediately available for employment. Reserve units are prepared for contingency missions. If the reserve is committed, the commander designates a new reserve. In this case, his least committed unit is the first choice. Section III. Strike Campaigns 3-9. Targets. This section provides guidance on the organization, missions, concepts, and operations of strike campaigns. Strike campaigns consist of a series of major combat operations targeted against insurgent tactical forces and bases in contested or insurgent-controlled zones. Other internal defense activities may support tactical forces during strike operations. Strike campaign operations are usually of relatively short duration (generally, one day to several weeks). While the guidance outlined here is focused on the infantry brigade, this section may be extended to apply to any combined arms organization conducting counterguerrilla operations. 3-10. Organization. Brigades assigned strike campaign missions either are relieved from area responsibility in advance of the mission or, preferably, are constituted as specialized forces held at the national or regional levels. Brigade strike forces are organized as self-sufficient task forces capable of operating in areas remote from logistical bases. Brigades are assigned support bases in secure areas for elements not committed to operations. 3-10"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 3-11. Missions. Strike campaigns are conducted against guerrilla forces and bases. They serve to keep guerrilla forces moving and off balance. Strike campaign areas are usually outside of those undergoing consolidation or those under friendly control. Ground or water means of entry maybe used, but air assault or parachute deliveries can be employed. 3-12. Concepts. a. Strike campaigns include offensive tactics such as raids, reconnaissance in force, hasty or deliberate attacks, and pursuit (or combinations of these operations). b. Brigade strike campaign operations are conducted to: (1) Harass the guerrilla to prevent the buildup of personnel and logistical resources. (2) Destroy the guerrilla force and its base complexes. (3) Demonstrate support for the government and for the populace in the local area. (4) Expand consolidation areas. 3-13. Operations. a. Brigades committed to strike campaigns are assigned a tactical area of responsibility. The brigade commander normally assigns operational areas to the subordinate battalions which, in turn, may assign areas to companies. Company commanders may assign specific areas to platoons at times; however,’ platoons are normally assigned specific missions rather than operational areas. Each battalion normally establishes a separate operational support base (OSB). Companies normally operate from patrol bases, but at times may operate separate company OSBs. When the areas assigned to units are too large to be reconnoitered concurrently by subordinate units, commanders establish an order of priority for reconnaissance of the areas. b. Battalion commanders maintain reserve forces (ready forces) to react quickly to situations requiring an immediate response. Each rifle company patrols its area of operations continuously and aggressively. The location of the company patrol base and patrol routes are varied to ensure complete coverage of the area. c. The rifle company moves to, secures, and occupies the company patrol base with sufficient supplies to permit limited independent operations. If it is to operate in the same area for a period of time, it should consider establishing small ration and ammunition reserves. 3-11"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 d. The company area is patrolled to provide complete coverage day and night with emphasis on night patrols. Generally, platoon-size patrols have sufficient firepower to handle the situation if a guerrilla force is encountered. If additional support is needed, the company commander may maneuver his other platoons against the guerrillas, or he may request assistance from the battalion reserve (ready force). Emphasis is placed on engaging the guerrilla with organic means of fire and movement (if required) and on employing supporting artillery and air support. e. Orders issued to the company commanders include the area assigned and resupply instructions. The conduct of operations is based on decentralized planning and execution. Company commanders plan and coordinate platoon activities to ensure completion of the overall company mission. Platoons on patrol carry light rations and store unneeded equipment at OSBs. f. Rifle company mortars may (at times) be located in battalion OSBs while fire support teams (FIST) move with the companies. If the terrain and situation permit, battalion OSBs may be moved as the companies move their patrol bases. If civilian communities are in the area, and if security conditions permit, battalion bases may be near (but not within) the community. Here, the battalion may conduct psychological, intelligence, and military-civic action operation. g. Brigade commanders use all available means to locate guerrilla forces and bases, and they give priority to destroying the guerrilla forces. An attack on a guerrilla force normally requires superior combat power. Reserves (ready forces) attempt to immediately engage and destroy moving guerrilla forces before they can disperse. Depending on the situation, either hasty or deliberate attacks are made on guerrilla bases that contain fortifications. After a successful attack on guerrilla forces, troops thoroughly search the area for guerrilla personnel, supplies, equipment, and documents. Pursuit operations are undertaken to destroy or capture forces attempting to flee. Artillery, air support, and air assault forces support ground pursuit. h. The brigade does not normally occupy the area defensively for an extended time following a successful attack. Operations to search out guerrillas continue. Elements of the brigade may be rotated through the brigade support base for periods of rest and training. i. Speed and surprise are important in strike operations, especially when attacking a known guerrilla stronghold. The sudden and unexpected delivery of combat forces into a guerrilla-held or contested area provides significant advantages to the counter- guerrilla commander. If caught by surprise, the guerrilla maybe unable to react in time to save himself. He is confused initially and 3-12"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 may panic. In the time it takes him to become aware of the tactical situation, or to take effective action, the counterguerrilla forces may encircle him. Speed and surprise may be achieved by using air assault tactics to insert the first counterguerrilla forces into the area of operations. Subsequent forces can be delivered on later airlifts or by other modes of transportation. j. Strike forces are most vulnerable just after entering a new area of operations. Initially, there is some confusion until patrol bases are established and patrols are sent out. counterguerrilla forces must be especially security conscious the first few hours in a new location. Upon arrival, they should immediately establish target reference points, observation posts, and listening posts. Section IV. Consolidation Campaigns 3-14. Control. a. This section provides the brigade guidance on the missions, organization, and operations of consolidation compaigns. Consolidation campaigns are the application of all civil and military aspects of internal defense and internal development programs. They are designed to establish, regain, or maintain control of specific areas. b. The brigade participates in consolidation campaigns by conducting tactical, intelligence, psychological, civil affairs, populace and resources control, and advisory assistance operations. c. Brigades committed to consolidation campaigns support the overall host country internal defense and development (IDAD) effort by applying their resources in the following manner: (1) In the preparation and offensive phases, tactical operations are stressed. Initial area control is established by clearing guerrilla forces from an area, expanding it, and linking it to other areas as they are cleared. (2) In the development phase, the primary mission is tactical operations to maintain security of the cleared area. Concur- rently, the brigade performs intelligence, psychological, populace and resources control, civil affairs, and advisory assistance operations. The brigade also conducts military-civic action in conjunction with civil affairs programs. (3) During the completion phase, when guerrilla activity within a consolidated area has been largely neutralized and host country agencies have resumed control of the area, the brigade begins to phase out its participation in local operations and prepares to conduct operations in another area. 3-13"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 3-15. Preparatory phase. Consolidation campaign plans are detailed and provide for long-range commitment of both personnel and materiel. Plans are coordinated with all agencies involved in the consolidation campaign. In addition to planning, the brigade conducts necessary training and becomes engaged in intelligence and other FID activities. 3-16. Offensive phase. a. The offensive phase of a consolidation campaign involves moving the civil-military task force into the operational area, neutralizing guerrilla forces and sympathizers, and removing insurgent personnel who may have infiltrated the local govern- ment. b. Patrolling, area surveillance, ambushes, and other small-unit actions are used extensively. Offensive operations, such as movements to contact, hasty or deliberate attacks, raids, or pursuits follow the small unit reconnaissance as targets are located. c. Care is taken that once cleared, the friendly, controlled areas are not allowed to revert to guerrilla domination. 3-17. Development and completion phases. a. During the development and completion phases of a consolidation campaign, brigade operations involve holding an area to permit government agencies to conduct their internal defense and development programs. Operations also involve training local forces to assume the defensive and security missions from the regular armed forces. Aggressive defensive operations provide security against guerrilla attack, deny guerrillas access to support, and provide a secure base from which to expand the consolidated areas. Offensive action is continued to destroy guerrilla forces; however, defense must be provided for population centers, tactical bases, logistical installations, airbases and airfields, and lines of communication. b. Defensive actions are conducted to accomplish one or more of the following: (1) Destroy or capture guerrilla forces. (2) Reduce guerrilla capability and opportunity for offensive action. (3) Deny guerrilla entry into an area. 3-14"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 (4) Provide security and thus develop favorable conditions for other IDAD operations. c. The normal defense in consolidation campaign operations employs small-unit tactics, using air assault and other reserve forces (ready forces) to immediately react to intelligence or an insurgent attack. Artillery and air support is prearranged to the degree possible, and plans are adjusted as required. d. Security forces conduct extensive patrolling throughout the area. The bulk of the brigade force may be assigned areas of responsibility and be heavily engaged in patrolling and supporting efforts of local security forces. e. The composition of the brigade reserve varies with the size of the area, nature of the enemy threat, and the terrain. Some brigade units may be fragmented into small elements and required to defend dispersed installations. In this situation, the reserve elements are assigned contingency missions to provide reaction forces for several installations. f. Area coverage may require assignment of fire support units to a much lower level than is normal in conventional operations. To support dispersed security elements, decentralization of fire support may be required. Direct fire supporting weapons (including artillery in the direct fire role) can be effective at short ranges when using time and super quick fuze. Direct fire support weapons are important if the guerrilla force moves within the minimum range of indirect fire weapons. g. All military and critical civilian installations and population centers must be protected against sabotage and attack. h. The larger installations and communities and the surrounding smaller ones mutually assist each other in their defense. Fire support from several installations and communities can contribute to mutual defense. i. The defense of communities is primarily the task of local paramilitary forces and police. The defense of communities is conducted with special emphasis on physical security and populace and resources control measures. In planning the defense, military units may be required to secure lines of communication in the area. They may do so by surveillance, occupation of tactical positions, or use of guards for convoy security, patrolling, and security posts. Along lines of communi- cation, fixed security posts protect critical points such as terminals, tunnels, bridges, and road or railway junctions. The size of the security post depends on the mission and the type and size of the hostile forces which may attack it. Security posts in remote areas are larger than those near supporting forces. 3-15"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 Section V. Offensive Operations 3-18. Three phases. This section discusses offensive operations which brigades (and subordinate units) may have to conduct. For purposes of organization and clarity, operations are discussed under those phases of an insurgency in which they will most often have to be conducted. Depending on the tactical situation, these operations, or variations and combinations of them, may be conducted during any of the three phases of insurgent activity: latent and incipient insurgency; guerrilla warfare; and war of movement. 3-19. Phase I — Latent and incipient insurgency. a. This phase ranges from subversive activity that is only a potential threat, latent or incipient, to situations in which frequent subversive incidents and activities occur in an organized pattern. It involves no major outbreak of violence or uncontrolled insurgency activity. b. Possible insurgent activities during Phase I include attacks on police forces, other terroristic activities, and some minor military operations carried out to gain additional influence over the population (or provide arms for the movement) and to challenge the government’s ability to maintain law and order. Furthermore, groundwork is laid for extensive external materiel support which is essential in most cases for the expansion of the insurgency and its eventual success. 3-20. Police-type operations. a. b. c. To control the movement of insurgents or guerrillas, and their materiel, police-type operations are conducted. These operations are executed by host country police, paramilitary, or military forces. For various reasons, this may not be possible, and US forces may have to conduct police-type operations until host country forces are available to relieve them. (Under US law, the military cannot advise or train foreign police forces.) If US forces must conduct this type of operation, military police units are suitable for this function. If they are not available, combat forces do the job. When conducting police operations, host government representatives are with US troops to serve as interpreters and advise on local customs and courtesies. When performing these duties, US troops treat passive civilians and their property with as much courtesy and respect as the situation permits. 3-16"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 3-21. Searches. a. b. c. d. e. f. g. h. The need for a counterguerrilla force to conduct search operations or to employ search procedures is a continuous requirement. Most search operations support strike operations or consolidation operations, or they may be conducted as the main effort in populace and resources control operations. A search maybe oriented to people, to materiel, to buildings, or to terrain. It usually involves both civil police and military personnel. Since misuse of search authority can adversely affect the ultimate outcome of operations agtainst guerrillas, seizure of contraband, evidence, intelligence material, supplies, or minor items during searches must be accomplished lawfully and properly recorded to be of future legal value. Proper use of authority in searches gains the respect and support of the people. Abusive, excessive, or inconsiderate search methods may temporarily suppress the guerrilla force or expose elements of it, but at the same time such methods may ultimately increase the civilian population’s sympathy for and/or support of the guerrilla. Authority for search operations is carefully reviewed. Military personnel must be aware that they perform searches only in areas within military jurisdiction (or where otherwise lawful) for purposes of apprehending suspects or securing evidence that tends to prove an offense has been committed. Usually, there are special laws regulating the search powers of the military forces. These laws are given wide dissemination. Search teams have detailed instruction on controlled items. Lists of prohibited or controlled-distribution items such as chemicals, medicines, machine tools, and other items should be distributed. The military or civil police who administer the populace and resources control program are contacted before the conduct of search operations, or periodically if search operations are a continuing activity. Search operations involving US forces maybe ineffective when language difficulties prevent full communication with the indigenous population. US units given a search mission are provided with interpreters as required. The pace at which a search operation is conducted is slow enough to allow for an effective search but not so slow as to allow the guerrilla force time to react to the threat of the search. If active resistance develops to the search operation, offensive operations are conducted to eliminate the resistance. Consideration is fiven to returning to a searched area after the completion of an initial search to surprise and eliminate 3-17"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 guerrillas or their infrastructure that may have remained undetected or may have returned. 3-22. Search of individuals. The fact that anyone in an area to be searched can be a guerrilla or a guerrilla sympathizer is stressed in all search operations. However, searchers are tactful to avoid making an enemy out of a suspect who may, in fact, support the host country government. It is during the initial handling of a person about to be searched that the greatest caution is required. During the search of an individual, one member of a search team always covers the other member who makes the actual search. (For information on how to conduct searches, see Appendix G.) 3-23. Checkpoints, roadblocks, and vehicle searches. a. It will be necessary to maintain a continuous check on road movement to apprehend suspects and to prevent smuggling of controlled items. This requires the use of checkpoints. Since checkpoints cause considerable inconvenience and even fear, it is important that the civil population understands that checkpoints are a preventive and not a punitive measure. b. Checkpoints maybe described as either deliberate or hasty. The deliberate checkpoint is positioned in a town or in the open country, often on a main road. It acts as a useful deterrent to unlawful movement. The hasty checkpoint is highly mobile and is quickly positioned in a town or in the open country. The actual location of the hasty checkpoint is designed to achieve quick success. c. Concealment of a checkpoint is desirable, but often impossible. The location should make it difficult for a person to turn back or reverse a vehicle without being observed. Culverts, bridges, or deep cuts may be suitable locations. Positions beyond sharp curves have the advantage that drivers do not see the checkpoint in sufficient time to avoid inspection. Safety disadvantages may outweigh the advantages of such positions. A scarcity of good roads increases the effect of a well-placed checkpoint. d. A checkpoint requires adequate troops to prevent ambush and surprise by a guerrilla force. An element of the checkpoint force is positioned and concealed an appropriate distance (one hundred to several hundred meters) from the checkpoint to prevent the escape of any vehicle or person attempting to turn back upon sighting the checkpoint. The vehicle, driver, and passengers are searched. If the checkpoint is manned for any length of time, part of the force is allowed to rest. The rest area is located near the search area so that the troops can be assembled quickly as a reserve force. (For 3-18"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 information on how to conduct checkpoints and roadblocks, see Appendix G.) 3-24. Search of built-up areas - cordon and search operations. a. Techniques. Search techniques in built-up areas are practiced by police and military forces operating in populated areas. These techniques are required for searching either a few isolated huts or buildings, or for searching well-developed urban sections. Search operations in built-up areas require thorough preparation and rehearsal. Special emphasis should be given to the following: (1) Divide the area to be searched into zones, and assign a search party to each. A search party consists of a search element (to conduct the search), a security element (to encircle the area and prevent entrance and exit, and to secure open areas), and a reserve element (to assist, as required). (a) The search element conducts the mission assigned for the operation. Normally it is organized into special teams. (b) The security element surrounds the area while the search element moves in. Members of the security element orient primarily upon evaders from the populated area; however, they can cut off any insurgents trying to reinforce. Checkpoints and road blocks are established. Subsurface routes of escape, such as subways and sewers, must be considered when operating in cities. (c) The reserve element is a mobile force within a nearby area. Its specific mission is to assist the other two elements should they meet resistance they cannot handle. In addition, it is capable of replacing or reinforcing either of the other two elements should the need arise. (2) Consider any enemy material found, including propaganda signs and leaflets, to be booby-trapped until inspection proves it is safe. (3) Thoroughly search underground and underwater areas. Any freshly excavated ground can be a hiding place. Use mine detectors to locate metal objects underground and under- water. (4) Deploy rapidly, especially when a guerrilla force is still in the area to be searched. The entire area to be searched is 3-19"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 surrounded simultaneously. If this is not possible, observed fire must cover that portion not covered by soldiers. b. Principles. A basic principle when searching a built-up area is to conduct it with limited inconvenience to the population. The populace may be inconvenienced to the point where they discourage guerrillas and insurgent sympathizers from remaining in the locale, but not to the point that they collaborate with the guerrilla force as a result of the search. The large-scale search of a built-up area is normally a combined civil police and military operation. It is planned in detail and rehearsed when possible. Physical reconnaissance of the area just prior to a search is avoided. Information needed about the terrain may be obtained from aerial photographs. In larger towns or cities, the local police may have detailed maps showing relative size and location of buildings. For success, the search plan must be simple and be executed swiftly. c. Command and control. Normally, a search involving a battalion or larger force is best controlled by the military commander with the civil police in support. A search involving a smaller force is best controlled by the civil police with the military in support. Regardless of the controlling agency, the actual search is performed by host country police when they are available in adequate numbers and have been trained in search operations. (For detailed information on how to conduct cordon and search operations, see Appendix G.) 3-25. Aerial search operations. a. b. c. d. Search unite mounted in armed helicopters use the mobility and firepower of these aircraft to the maximum. (This may seriously affect the morale of the guerrilla force.) Air assault combat patrols, conducting an aerial search, reconnoiter an assigned area or route in search of guerrilla forces. When a guerrilla force is located, the air assault combat patrol may engage it from the air or may land and engage it on the ground. This technique has little value in areas of dense vegetation. Use of air assault combat patrols should be limited to those operations in which sufficient intelligence exists to justify their use and then normally in conjunction with ground oper- ations. In ground search operations, helicopters drop off troops in an area suspected of containing guerrilla elements. With the helicopters overmatching from the air, troops search the area. Troops are then picked up and the process is repeated in other areas. Members of air assault combat patrols should be trained in tracking procedures in order to follow guerrillas to their base. If 3-20"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 the patrol encounters a large guerrilla force, the reserve (ready forces) are committed. Plans must provide for evacuation of prisoners, casualties, and materiel. 3-26. Civil disturbance and riot control. a. US forces participating in counterguerrilla operations may be tasked to assist host country police and military forces in restoring order disrupted by civil disturbance or riot. If this occurs, US force participation should be limited to containing the disturbance and protecting US lives and property. b. The suppression of demonstrators or rioters should be left entirely to host country forces. Any direct action by US troops against demonstrators or rioters will be misrepresented by the insurgents and their sympathizers as brutal suppression of legitimate dissent and be used by them as a propaganda weapon. (For further information on specific techniques, see FM 19-15.) 3-27. Phase II — Guerrilla warfare. a. Phase II is reached when the subversive movement, having gained sufficient local or external support, initiates organized guerrilla warfare or related forms of violence against the government. Examples of insurgent activities during Phase II include: (1) Activities initiated in Phase I are continued and expanded. Insurgent control, both political and military, over territory and populace, is intensified. (2) Guerrilla warfare is used on a larger scale, and limited defense is conducted in some geographic areas. (3) An insurgent government is established in insurgent- dominated areas as the military situation permits. In areas not yet controlled, efforts are made to neutralize actual or potential opposition groups and to increase infiltration into government agencies. Intimidation through terror and threat of guerrilla action increases and thus becomes more significant. b. Militarily, the major goal is to control additional areas; the government is forced to strain its resources trying to protect everything at the same time. Insurgent forces attempt to tie down government troops in static defense tasks, interdict and destroy lines of communications, and capture or destroy supplies and other government resources. 3-21"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 3-28. Small-unit operations. Small-unit operations are used against guerrilla activities in the second phase of an insurgency. They are effective since small units can cover more territory than a large unit, they keep the guerrilla off balance, and their friendly firepower (that can be rapidly massed) may provide a favorable ratio in meeting engagements. In Phase II, the guerrilla is usually operating in smaller units, too. 3-29. Raid. a. b. c. A raid is an operation involving a swift penetration of hostile territory to secure information, harass the guerrilla force, or destroy the guerrilla force and its installation. It ends in a planned withdrawal upon completion of the assigned mission. A successful raid is based on accurate, timely, and detailed information. Raids are usually targeted against single, isolated guerrilla base camps. To assist in attaining surprise, the raiding force uses inclement weather, limited visibility, or terrain normally considered impassable. The raiding force is normally organized into an assault element and a security element. A larger raiding force may add a support element while a small raiding force includes supporting weapons in the assault element. The use of airborne and air assault forces for a raid enhances surprise. If night airborne or air assault raids are conducted, the force must be accurately inserted and oriented on the ground. Air assault forces supported by armed helicopters offer infinite possibilities for conducting raids. This type of raid force can move in, strike the objective, and withdraw without extensive preparation or support from other sources. (For further information on the composition and organization of raid forces, see FM 7-8, FM 7-10, and FM 7-20.) 3-30. Patrols. a. Conventional patrolling doctrine normally applies to counter- guerrilla operations, but some techniques must be oriented to meet the guerrilla’s activities and the operational environment. Patrolling becomes more significant in counterguerrilla operations because of the difficulty in locating and identifying guerrilla forces and determining their intentions. Patrolling is used when limited (or no) intelligence on guerrilla activity is available. Personnel should be thoroughly briefed, carry only mission-essential equipment, and be physically fit. Routes are planned carefully and coordinated with higher, lower, and adjacent units, to include air and ground fire support elements and reserve forces. 3-22"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 b. Patrolling is done to find and destroy the guerrilla, and to deny him use of an area. Patrols are usually categorized as either combat or reconnaissance. c. Patrols can be employed to: (1) Saturate areas of suspected guerrilla activity. (2) Control critical roads and trails. (3) Maintain contact between villages and units. (4) Establish population checkpoints. (5) Provide security for friendly forces. (6) Interdict guerrilla routes of supply and communication. (7) Establish ambushes. (8) Pursue, maintain contact with, and destroy guerrillas. (9) Provide internal security in rural areas. (10) Locate guerrilla units and base camps. d. Saturation patrolling is extremely effective in Phase II situations. In this technique, patrols are conducted by many lightly armed, small, fast-moving units and provide thorough area coverage. Patrols move over planned and coordinated routes which are changed frequently to avoid establishing patterns. Use of saturation patrolling results in the sustained denial of an area to guerrilla forces as they seek to avoid contact with the counter- guerrilla units. In addition to harassment and discovery of guerrilla tactical forces, this technique provides: (1) An opportunity to gain an intimate knowledge of the area of operations. (2) A form of reassurance to the local population that the government is concerned about their protection and security. (3) A means by which information about the guerrilla can be obtained. (For further information on preparation, execution, and operational techniques of patrols, see FM 7-10, FM 7-20, and Appendix D.) 3-31. Ambush a. An ambush is a surprise attack from a concealed position upon a moving or temporarily halted target. Ambushes give the counterguerrilla force several advantages: (1) An ambush does not require ground to be seized or held. (2) Smaller forces with limited weapons and equipment can harass or destroy larger, better armed forces. 3-23"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 (3) Guerrillas can be forced to engage in decisive combat at unfavorable times and places. (4) Guerrillas can be denied freedom of movement and deprived of weapons and equipment that are difficult to replace. b. Well-planned and well-executed ambushes maybe the most successful operational technique employed against guerrillas. It is an effective technique to interdict movement of guerrilla forces within an area. Selection of the site is a key step in developing a well-organized ambush. Also, leaders must be proficient in using mines, antihandling devices, demolitions, and expedient devices for organization of the position. Fire support is prepared for immediate delivery on call. 3-32. Night ambush. Ambush during darkness is difficult to control, but darkness increases the security of the ambush party and the confusion of those being ambushed. A small ambush party generally is more practical; however, the size of the party depends on factors such as the size of the unit to be ambushed and the estimated guerrilla strength in the area. (For further information on preparation, execution, and operational ambush techniques, see FM 7-8, FM 7-10, and Appendix C.) 3-33. Encirclement. a. Encirclement offers the best chance to fix guerrilla forces in position and achieve decisive results. The battalion and larger units will usually plan and conduct encirclements. The company and smaller units normally do not have the manpower and command and control capability to execute encirclements except as part of a larger force. b. Encirclements require accurate intelligence on the location of guerrilla elements. Since it requires a major portion of the counterguerrilla force to execute this maneuver, it is usually targeted against large guerrilla forces or guerrilla base complexes, a series of smaller base camps clustered within an area. c. Planning, preparation, and execution are aimed at encircling the guerrilla force rapidly. Maximum security and surprise can be gained by occupying the initial encirclement positions during darkness. d. In large operations, air assault and airborne troops add speed and surprise to the operation. Positions are occupied simultaneously in order to block escape. If simultaneous occupation is not possible, probable escape routes are covered first. Initial occupation is the most critical period of the operation. When the guerrillas become aware that they are being encircled, they will 3-24"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 e. f. g. h. i. probably probe for gaps or attack weak points and attempt to break out. Encircling units provide strong combat patrols far to their front to give early warning of attempted breakouts. Mobile reserves are positioned to counter a breakout and to reinforce difficult areas such as broken terrain or areas with caves, tunnels, or fortification complexes. Indirect fire support can serve to cloak an encirclement by gaining and holding the guerrillas’ attention. Fires are planned in detail to support the encirclement. Following completion of the encirclement, the circle is contracted to capture or destroy the guerrilla force. As the circle is contracted, units may be removed from the line and added to the reserve. Against small guerrilla forces, the encircled area may be cleared by contraction and a final sweep. Against larger guerrilla forces, however, at some point, some action other than contraction will be required. One technique consists of driving a wedge through the guerrilla force to divide it and then destroying the guerrillas in each subarea. Another technique, employed after some degree of contraction, is to employ a blocking force on one or more sides of the perimeter while the remainder of the encircling force drives the guerrillas against the blocking force. Either element may accomplish the actual destruction. This technique is effective when the blocking force can be located on, or immediately in the rear of, a natural terrain obstacle. (For further information, see Appendix G.) 3-34. Phase III — War of movement. The situation moves from Phase II to Phase III when insurgency becomes primarily a war of movement between organized insurgent forces and forces of the established government. During Phase III, insurgent activities conducted in Phases I and II are continued and expanded. Larger insurgent units are used to fight government forces and to capture key geographical and political objectives to be used to defeat government forces. 3-35. Large-unit operations. When an insurgency enters Phase III, the guerrilla begins to mass his forces and challenge government forces openly. He may begin to use conventional warfare tactics to a greater degree. He may even elect to stand and fight in defense of terrain if he feels that it is in his interest to retain it or if he feels that he can deal government forces a serious military or political defeat by defending. In this phase, conventional 3-25"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 warfare tactics can be effectively employed to defeat the guerrilla. (For further information on how to employ these tactics, see FM 7-8, FM 7-10, FM 7-20, and FM 7-30.) 3-36. Movement to contact. a. Movement to contact in counterguerrilla tactical operations is basically the same as in conventional conflicts. Night movement, clandestine movement, and counterambush precautions are emphasized. b. Care is taken to avoid ambushes in movement to contact. The infantry maintains contact by aggressive frontal and flank patrolling by small security elements, thereby exposing a minimum of troops to ambush. Supporting fires are placed close-in along, and parallel to, the route of advance. 3-37. Reconnaissance in force. a. Reconnaissance in force is a limited-objective operation to discover and test guerrilla positions, locations, and strength, and to gather information. In counterguerrilla operations, the objective is collection of information about guerrillas and the destruction of units and facilities. The commander is prepared to exploit meeting engagements and intelligence to achieve tactical success by conducting a hasty or deliberate attack to destroy discovered guerrilla units and facilities. The recon force may conduct the operation as a unit, or selected subordinate units may be committed on a limited scale. b. Reconnaissance-in-force operations normally develop information more rapidly and in more detail than do other reconnaissance methods. When firm intelligence is lacking, the principal effort of the recon unit may be a widespread and continuous reconnais- sance-in-force operation coupled with mandatory security missions. In arriving at a decision to reconnoiter in force, the commander considers: (1) His overall mission. (2) His knowledge of the enemy situation. (3) The urgency and importance of other information, (4) The efficiency and speed of other intelligence collection agencies. (5) The possibility that the reconnaissance may lead to a general engagement under favorable conditions. (6) The continuing requirements for local and area security. 3-26"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 (7) The availability of adequate reserves (reaction forces) and the resources to deliver them quickly to the area to be exploited. (8) The availability of adequate, all-weather fire support means. c. The reconnaissance elements in the force should have mobility at least equal to that of the enemy. Mobile reserves (ready forces) quickly exploit guerrilla weaknesses and influence the action. 3-38. Hasty attack. a. b. c. d. Once contact with the enemy is made, the commander deploys his force, coordinating movement, fires, air support, and other means in an attempt to immediately destroy the enemy or fully develop the situation. Generally, if the leading element contacting the enemy cannot defeat him quickly, the commander must decide whether to conduct a hasty attack or to take time to develop the situation more carefully and then conduct a deliberate attack. At times, the intelligence available to the commander indicates clearly which course he should follow. At other times, however, judgment may dictate that he conduct a hasty attack to avoid being held up by inferior forces and being unnecessarily delayed. At the same time, he must be careful to avoid being drawn into ambush. Conduct of a hasty attack is a difficult and challenging operation. Ideally, there should be no pause in the forward momentum of the force upon initial contact. Maneuver units swing into action immediately, using movement techniques appropriate to the enemy and terrain. The commander calls for available fire support. He coordinates and maneuvers resources so as to apply the combat power needed against the enemy. The hasty attack tries to fix enemy elements in place with firepower and either overrun or encircle them. Speed is essential. The reserve force has to be deployed early if maneuver elements are held up. If momentum is lost, the hasty attack fails. 3-39. Deliberate attack. a. When the force commander knows he has encountered a strong enemy force in well-prepared defensive positions, he may conclude that a deliberate attack is necessary. A deliberate attack is characterized by detailed (and widely distributed) knowledge of enemy positions, by large volumes of effectively delivered supporting fires, by extensive deception, by full exploitation of electronic warfare (EW), and by employing b. 3-27"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 measures beyond those possible in a hasty attack. Continued contact with the guerrilla force must be maintained to prevent its escape. 3-40. Exploitation. a. If an attack succeeds, exploitation and pursuit follow. Exploitation is an operation undertaken to follow up success in the attack. Following the principle of reinforcing success, immediate exploitation using an uncommitted element of the force is advisable. b. The exploiting force drives swiftly to disrupt guerrilla command and control functions, severs escape routes, destroys reserves and equipment, and denies the enemy an opportunity to reorganize his defense. The exploitation force is large, reasonably self-sufficient, and well-supported by tactical air, air cavalry, and attack helicopters. It does not pause to achieve minor tactical successes against isolated or fleeing enemy units; it attempts to fix them while concentrating on destroying the main guerrilla force. The commander provides mobile support, including helicopters for emergency supply of petroleum, oil, and lubricants (POL) and ammunition, and ensures sufficient follow-on forces to attack guerrilla forces bypassed or fixed by the exploiting force. 3-41. Pursuit. a. b. c. d. Pursuit is an offensive action against a retreating enemy. It is the final phase of the exploitation and occurs when a large guerrilla force attempts to disengage. Normally, it attempts to cut off escape routes and encircle and destroy the guerrilla force. It maintains pressure with an exploiting force. As the guerrilla unit disintegrates, exploitation may develop into pursuit. Pursuit may develop in any operation in which the enemy has lost his ability to operate effectively and attempts to flee. Pursuit requires energy and resolution to press on despite fatigue, dwindling supplies, or the approach of darkness. Nighttime pursuit increases the enemy’s confusion and speeds his disinte- gration. The primary purpose of pursuit is to destroy the guerrilla force. Although terrain objectives may be assigned as control measures, the primary objective is the guerrilla force. In pursuit, the requirements and command relationships for forces which follow and support are the same as in exploitation. They destroy bypassed enemy strongholds, relieve supported units that have halted to contain enemy forces, guard prisoners, 3-28"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 open and secure lines of communications, and control refugees. In conducting a pursuit, the commander maintains unremitting, direct pressure against the enemy while trying to envelop him to cut his line of retreat. When conditions permit, the commander orders double envelopments of the retreating guerrilla force. He makes maximum use of fire support, air assault forces, and offensive electronic warfare. Section VI. Defensive Operations 3-42. Variations. a. This section discusses defensive operations which brigades and subordinate units may have to conduct. Depending on the tactical situation, these operations, or variations of them, may be conducted during any phase of an insurgency. In some instances, the type of operation under consideration is identical to one already discussed in Section V. The difference is the purpose. b. For example, patrolling maybe either offensive or defensive in purpose. When its purpose is offensive, it is done to locate the enemy and destroy him. When its purpose is defensive, it is done to deny the enemy access to an area, and to keep him from organizing for offensive operation. (For similarities of offensive and defensive operations, see Section V.) c. This section also provides guidance to commanders concerned with the defense of various types of temporary or semipermanent bases, such as logistical installations, OSBS, airfields, and airbases, under varying conditions of security that may exist in an area of operations. d. It is also applicable to the defense of civilian communities. Commanders responsible for bases, facilities, and communities should exercise those principles and techniques discussed which apply to their particular situation. 3-43. Base defense environment. a. Defense and security of tactical units and installations are integral parts of combat missions. (The term “base” is used to include all types of facilities to be defended.) b. Base defense operations are executed under the guidance of an area commander whose responsibilities include protecting the resources of his area from interruptions caused by enemy activities. This is a territorial responsibility in which base commanders provide for the local defense of their immediate base areas. In addition, base commanders may be asked to provide 3-29"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 resources for other activities which may be classified as rear battle. c. The base defense environment is established in an area generally controlled by friendly forces but not sufficiently secure to prevent guerrillas from moving in small groups, establishing firing positions, or mounting small-scale attacks. d. Conditions which may characterize the environment for base defense include: (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) 3-44. US forces are in a host country. Other nations in similar roles may be in the same host country. Unity of command or a combined headquarters may or may not exist. Although there is organized armed conflict, there is no recognized state of war. Many of the guerrillas do not wear distinctive uniforms. At times, some may appear dressed in government uniforms. Guerrillas cannot always be distinguished from government supporters or neutrals even when they are conducting overt operations. External support may be provided to the guerrillas, both overtly and covertly. Nations or groups supporting the guerrillas may provide sanctuaries where guerrilla forces may establish base areas. Paramilitary forces may assume increased responsibilities. No military \"frontline\" exists where continuous contact can be maintained. Guerrillas usually do not hold territory. They may disperse and avoid combat at the appearance of a stronger force. Missions, functions, and responsibilities. a. Base defense consists of both normal and emergency local military measures taken to nullify or reduce the effectiveness of enemy attacks or sabotage. Base defense is conducted to ensure the continued effectiveness of its facilities and units to fulfill their missions. The commander of an area or a subarea that contains a base is responsible for its overall defense. The base commander, however, is responsible for its local defense; he must have under his operational control all forces, regardless of branch of service, that are assigned to the base primarily for its defense. Forces assigned b. 3-30"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 to the base for other primary purposes will also assist in local defense during an attack. Each commander of forces located at a base is responsible for: (1) Participating in preparation of base defense plans. Training his forces for base defense. (2) Providing appropriate facilities and essential personnel for the base defense operations center and appropriate personnel for the base defense force staff. (3) Providing for internal security of his own command. 3-45. Passive defense. In addition to their assigned defense missions, all units in the base area are responsible for maximum implementation of passive defense. Passive defense consists of measures taken to reduce the probability (and to minimize the effects) of damage caused by hostile action, without the expectation of taking the initiative. Responsibility for the conduct of specialized passive defense measures is assigned to firefighting units, chemical units, medical units, and other appropriate organizations capable of satisfying passive defense requirements. Additionally, all units assigned to the base initiate passive defense measures, such as dispersion, camouflage, blackout, and use of shelters. These measures assist in preserving the operating integrity of the base and ensuring decisive and effective action against enemy attack. 3-46. Command relationships. Command relationships for base defense operations provide unity of command while preserving simplicity. The urgency of base defense operations requires clear-cut authority. 3-47. Fundamentals of base defense. a. Base defense. It is established to provide all-round security for the base with available forces and is characterized by detailed planning and centralized control. Security measures may also include provisions to protect adjacent civilian communities, if feasible. Constant and aggressive action by friendly elements against enemy forces constitutes a major element of base defense. Vigilance and sound security measures reduce enemy interference with operations at the base and also tend to cause enemy forces to divert their operations from the area. Use of terrain. Proper evaluation and organization of the area are essential to hold down the number of additional forces required for base defense. Factors considered are: b. 3-31"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 (1) Natural defensive characteristics of the terrain. Use of artificial obstacles to enhance the natural defensive characteristics of the terrain. (2) Existing roads and waterways used for military lines of communications and civilian commerce. (3) Control of land areas surrounding the base complex to a range beyond that of enemy mortars and rockets, and also control of water approaches. (4) c. Security. Early warning of pending actions ensures the base commander time to react to any threat. Outposts, patrols, ground surveillance andcountermortar radar, infantry scout dogs (if available), and air reconnaissance and surveillance provide early warning. Civilian informants and actions of indigenous personnel near the base are excellent indicators of pending enemy actions. Security measures vary with enemy threat, forces available, and other factors; all-round security is essential. d. Mutual support. Defending forces are positioned to ensure mutual employment of defensive resources, which include fires, observation, and maneuver elements. Mutual support between defensive elements requires careful planning, positioning, and coordination because of the circular aspects of the base area. Surveillance, obstacles, prearranged fires, and maneuver are used to control gaps. Defense plans provide for use of all available support, including attack helicopters and close air support. e. All-round defense. In defensive planning, the base commander has to be prepared to defend against enemy attack from any direction. Plans are sufficiently flexible, and reserves are positioned to permit reaction to any threat. Base defense forces (BDF) are assigned primary and alternate positions and sectors of responsibility. All personnel are assigned duty stations or shelters. f. Defense in depth. Alternate and supplementary positions, combat outposts, and mutually supporting strongpoints in front of the base forward defense area extend the depth. The commander plans fires throughout the defensive area up to the maximum range of available weapons. Portable obstacles may be placed around critical targets during reduced visibility to disrupt the enemy’s plan and add depth to the defense. Responsiveness. Attacks against a base may range from long-range sniper, mortar, or rocket fire to attacks by suicide demolition squads or major forces. The enemy has the advantage of deciding when, where, and with what force he will attack. The defender positions his forces and plans fires and movement so he can respond to the widest possible range of enemy actions. The g. 3-32"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 defender prepares plans, to include counterattack plans, and rehearses, evaluates, and revises them as necessary. h. Maximum use of offensive action. Since the objective of the base defense is to maintain a secure base, the defender uses offensive action to the maximum to engage enemy forces outside the base. On initial occupation of the base site, friendly forces take offensive actions to destroy enemy forces in the immediate area. The area commander employs patrols, raids, ambushes, air attacks, and supporting fires to harass and destroy any remaining enemy force. Once the enemy has been cleared from the area, the base can be defended by a smaller force. The BDF commander maintains constant liaison with major tactical unit commanders in the area to stay abreast of efforts to remove the threat. 3-48. Defense preparations. a. Implementation of base defense measures in a new base begins before base units arrive, if possible. Normally, combat units provide the initial defense in a new base area, These combat forces remain in the base area, conducting aggressive offensive actions, until base units are capable of assuming the mission. When base units arrive, they immediately start organizing the base defense. They perform many of the tasks concurrently, but some tasks require priority. The base commander specifies the sequence for preparation of the defense system. (FM 7-8, FM 7-10, and FM 7-20 provide a recommended sequence for tactical defense. For more information on base defense, see Appendix E.) 3-49. Patrols. b. a. b. c. Base defense operations to counter small groups of enemy forces include aggressive, frequent patrolling by squad- and platoon-size forces to detect and capture or destroy small groups of guerrillas. Infantry scout dogs, if available, maybe used to add security and additional detection ability to patrol operations. Patrolling is conducted by small, highly mobile units moving on foot or by vehicles during daylight and darkness. It may include the use of aircraft or boats. Populated areas near the base are searched, and surprise checkpoints are established along known or suspected routes of guerrilla communications. Dug-in or concealed night ambush sites are manned outside the barrier system trace on a random basis. Indigenous personnel should accompany ambushes near populated areas. Their knowledge of local populace and terrain assists the ambush mission. Artillery and mortar targets are registered and plotted to 3-33"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 provide rapid on-call support. Detectors and sensors are emplaced to provide early warning. d. BDF or other base unit reconnaissance patrols obtain target acquisition data. They may penetrate known guerrilla-controlled territory to install sensors that report the enemy’s presence along infiltration and supply routes. In addition, such patrols observe known infiltration and supply routes and report any activity along these routes. They provide early warning of guerrilla assembly of personnel; movement of weapons, ammunition, or other supplies; and preparation of mortar and rocket firing sites. In addition to the acquisition of specific targets, reconnaissance patrols may be used to locate suspected areas where other types of surveillance or acquisition systems may be employed to obtain information. Indigenous personnel are valuable assets to reconnaissance patrols. Their knowledge of the terrain, ability to operate effectively in the environment, knowledge of the language, and familiarity with local customs are useful. e. Combat patrols, when used for base defense, are employed in difficult terrain some distance from the base but within range of supporting artillery. Combat patrols employ ranger-type tactics and remain committed for relatively long periods. They may be supplied by air and equipped to communicate with the base and supporting aircraft. Such patrols may vary in size from squad to platoon. They have the mission of making planned searches to locate areas used by guerrillas to hide supplies, regroup, rest, train, or otherwise prepare for offensive actions. Small groups of guerrillas are engaged and destroyed. Large groups are reported and kept under surveillance until they are attacked. Augmentation in the form of local paramilitary guides or trackers increases the effectiveness of combat patrols. (1) Reaction force operations. When a guerrilla unit is located, the reaction force is deployed rapidly to engage the unit, disrupt its cohesion, and destroy it. If the guerrilla force cannot be contained and destroyed, contact is maintained; reinforcements are dispatched if needed; and the guerrillas are pursued. When escape routes have been effectively blocked, the attack is continued to destroy the enemy force. The required mobility is provided by ground and air vehicles and by rapid foot movement. Wheeled vehicles for reaction forces are predesignated. (a) Reaction operations are simple, planned, and rehearsed day and night. Primary and alternate points are predesignated for the release of reaction forces from centralized control to facilitate movement against multiple targets. Such points are reconnoitered and photographed for use in planning and briefing. Within security limitations, actual release points are used 3-34"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 during rehearsals to promote complete familiarity with the area. (b) Immediate reaction to any type of attack is essential and is attained through employment of firepower and movement of forces and their equipment. Immediate reaction to accurate and timely intelligence may permit destruction of the guerrilla force before an attack. Immediate reaction to standoff mortar or rocket fire may permit destruction of the guerrilla force during an assault on the base and facilitate blocking routes of withdrawal. (2) Host and third country forces. The BDF commander normally considers the integration of host and third country forces in the overall base defense effort. Particular emphasis is on integration of host country forces in patrol and populace control activities. Both host and third country forces provide local security for their own units; however, to ensure maximum benefit, all such local plans should be coordinated with, and integrated in, the base master defense plan. The degree of participation in base defense by host and third country forces depends on the orders and guidance of their governments. 3-50. Securing lines of communication (LOC). a. Guerrillas may attempt to sever lines of communications (LOC) by various methods. Roads, waterways, and railways can be mined, or ambush sites located adjacent to them. Bridges and tunnels can be destroyed by demolitions. It is impossible to absolutely secure long lines of communication, but measures can be taken to minimize the effect of guerrilla activity against them. b. Patrolling by counterguerrilla forces increases the chances of detecting guerrillas before they can emplace mines or demolitions, or establish ambushes or roadblocks. During Phases I and 11 of an insurgent action, military police can do most of the patrolling of ground lines of communication, but the tactical situation may dictate combat forces having to perform this mission. c. Patrolling is done regularly, but patrols should not establish a routine which enables the guerrilla to avoid or ambush them. Patrols must pay particular attention to probable ambush sites and chokepoints where roadblocks or mines and demolitions would be effective. d. Aerial patrols are effective for covering large areas in a short time. e. Surface patrols are slower, but they can check routes in greater detail. Surface patrol members must be trained in the detection of mines and booby traps. Mine detectors and infantry scout dogs, if available, may aid them in this task. 3-35"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 f. g. h. i. j. The primary function of a patrol is to check the security of the routes it patrols. Ordinarily, manpower constraints prohibit a patrol from being organized and equipped to counter a large guerrilla force; however, reinforcement by artillery and attack helicopters increases a patrol’s capability to deal with guerrillas they encounter. Patrols are organized with enough combat power to survive an initial contact. Recent guerrilla activity provides guidance on how patrols are organized. If the guerrilla is found in strength, his destruction is the reaction force mission. Patrols always attempt to make initial contact with the smallest of their elements, and they must be thoroughly proficient in counter- ambush techniques. Roadblocks, checkpoints, and guardposts at critical chokepoints (such as bridges and tunnels) are effective in preventing acts of sabotage. Vehicles and persons are stopped and searched before being allowed to proceed. Vehicles are not allowed to stop on or under bridges or in tunnels. Critical chokepoints are watched carefully at night. Personnel guarding them are equipped with night vision equipment, and ground surveillance radar and sensors are used to cover the immediate, surrounding area. Curves on railroads are also watched. Mining indirect approaches to sensitive areas may help to lessen the chances of ground attack. The area is ringed with planned artillery fires, and bunkers are constructed to protect guard personnel and provide them positions from which to fight until reinforced. Underwater approaches to bridges are reinforced by booby-trapped obstacles. Engineers are used to help keep lines of communication open. They can locate and clear mines, clear potential ambush sites, and repair damage. They may also prepare defensive systems around chokepoints. 3-51. Defending against guerrilla offensive. a. When insurgent action enters Phase III, the guerrilla may begin to attack using conventional tactics with the intention of capturing and holding facilities, installations, bases, communities, and t.errority. He also attemps to permanently sever critical lines of communication. These attacks are similar to attacks conducted by conventional infantry except the initial absence of established lines enables the guerrilla to strike from any direction, or from many directions at once. As host government and US forces react to these initiatives, enemy and friendly lines may evolve; however, during the initial stages of the guerrilla’s offensive campaign, friendly bases, facilities, installation, and even cities may be surrounded and come under siege. 3-36"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 The organization of the defense and the construction of physical defenses must be at least partially completed prior to the guerrilla’s attack if the defenders are expected to hold until a counteroffense can begin. c. Once enemy and friendly lines are established, conventional tactics are employed by both sides. Initially, however, US forces may have to conduct limited attacks to reopen lines of communi- cation or to relieve besieged areas. Section VII. Common Operations Operations common to offensive and defensive counterguerrilla operations may be conducted during any of the three phases of an insurgency. The degree to which these operations are utilized is dependent on the tactical situation. 3-52. Movement security. a. All movements of troops and supplies are planned and conducted as tactical operations with emphasis on extensive security measures. These security measures may include: b. (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) Secrecy when planning and disseminating orders, strict noise and light discipline during movement when appropriate, and varying routes and schedules of movement. Security forces organized and equipped to ensure effective front, flank, and rear security during movement and halts. Pre-positioning security elements along the route of movement helps in performing route reconnaissance and movement security. Coordination with supporting air units to ensure a thorough understanding of air support used to assist the movement, both in taking preventive measures and in close combat operations. The need for secrecy may preclude initial air cover, but it will not preclude use of close air support when required. The use of aerial photographs is critical. Fire support elements which provide close and continuous fire support for the movement. Maneuver for counterambush actions, to include contingency plans for immediate action against an ambush and use of formations which allow part of the column to be in position to maneuver against an ambush force. Communications with supporting units, adjacent host country forces, and higher headquarters, to include airborne radio relay. 3-37"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 Varying the location of leaders, communications, and automatic weapons within the movement formation. (8) Questioning local civilians along the movement route for intelligence information, to include possible guerrilla ambush sites. (9) Movement by bounds with overmatching fire. (10) Use of infantry scout dogs, if available, and other ambush detection means. (7) b. Organization of the movement depends upon the type of movement, whether by ground, air, or water. c. Planning for movement is coordinated with military units along routes of movement and considers the following: (1) Communications. Communications are vital to the success of movements. Radio communication is planned and available between convoy serials and march units, with artillery forward observers and air controllers, and with units and population centers in the areas along the route of movement. Visual and sound signals, which include colored smoke, identification panels, and whistle or horn signals, are prearranged. While limited, these communication means are effective when prearranged meanings and responses are understood and rehearsed. (2) Artillery and mortar support. Artillery and mortar support may be provided by units within range of the route of movement or by artillery and mortars which may be positioned within range of the proposed route. Movements requiring artillery and mortar support have observers either with them or in supporting observation aircraft. Strip maps marked with planned targets enable personnel (other than forward observers) to request fires. Coordination with fire direction centers (FDC) capable of providing fire along the route of movement ensures that forward observers can enter the FDC net, make routine location reports, and request and adjust fires. Call signs, frequencies, authentications, areas of possible employment, schedules of movement, and target numbers are coordinated. (3) Aircraft. Experience has shown that the presence of aircraft deters ambushes. Column movement covered by traveling overwatch or bounding overwatch attack helicopters, in conjunction with a route reconnaissance by scout helicopters or fixed-wing strike aircraft, maybe requested. Planning includes the type, number, and method of employ- ment of aircraft. Methods of employment include column cover, air alert, and ground alert. Column cover by fighter 3-38"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 aircraft is expensive in terms of crew fatigue and equipment maintenance; therefore, light observation-type aircraft that can direct on-call air support are used for short movements over frequently used routes in more secure areas. When air support is planned, communications information concerning radio frequencies, call signs, and identification procedures is provided to all who may need to use them. In addition, the supporting air unit knows the maneuver intentions of the ground element in case of ambush. (4) Route clearing. This operation may be conducted before certain critical movements. The use of route-clearing operations depends upon the availability of troops, the importance of the movement, and the guerrilla threat within the area. Normally the units responsible for the area through which the movement will pass are used in route-clearing operations. These route-clearing forces normally include both mounted and dismounted elements. In addition to a thorough reconnaissance of the main route of movement, critical terrain near the route is secured. This maybe done by placing pickets along critical stretches of the route or by selective placement of tactical units. (5) Reserves. Reserves (ready forces) are vital to countering ambushes. The guerrilla must be convinced that ambushes produce a fast, relentless, hard-hitting response by counter- guerrilla supporting forces, to include airstrikes and ground pursuit. Prior to a movement, reserve force commanders and aviators are briefed on the general area of operations; landing areas, known and suspected guerrilla locations, and communications are emphasized. If the distance to be covered from a single location prevents quick reaction, reserve ready forces are designated in successive areas. (For further information on movement security, see Appendix G.) 3-53. Motor movement. a. Special escort attachments may not be available to support all motor movements; therefore, many convoys must be prepared to secure themselves for part or all of the distance. When a maneuver unit is designated to provide escort for a vehicle convoy, elements of the unit provide escort through their respective areas of responsibility. Armor or armored cavalry units are ideally suited to provide convoy escorts. Reconnaissance of the route immediately prior to the passage of the convoy is desirable. When a single unit is to provide escort through other units’ areas of responsibility, the single unit coordinates closely with those other units to ensure adequate fire support and available reinforcements during passage of the convoy. 3-39"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 Since there is seldom time to issue orders during an ambush, the security detachment’s actions are planned and, when possible, rehearsed by drills prior to the movement. c. Convoy command responsibility is clearly fixed throughout the chain of command. The commander and as many of his subordinates as possible are briefed on the latest information about the area through which they are to pass. The commander formulates his plans and issues his orders to include formation, intervals between echelons and vehicles, rate of travel, and detailed plans for action if a guerrilla force attacks the convoy. All personnel board their vehicle in such a way that they can dismount rapidly into predrilled formations. Arms and ammunition are readied for immediate action, and vehicle commanders are responsible for keeping personnel alert (Figure 3-1 ). d. Convoys may be escorted by reconnaissance aircraft or attack helicopters and may have tactical air support on call. The use of reconnaissance Army aircraft to survey routes immediately b. forward of a convoy often provides early warning of danger. - 3-40"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 3-54. Armor and cavalry movement. a. During movements, unit vehicles and equipment are arranged to facilitate their employment upon contact with, or interference from, the enemy. Traveling, traveling overwatch, and bounding overwatch techniques are used in movement. (See FM 71-2 for armor ground movement security techniques, and FM 17-95 for cavalry movement techniques.) Air cavalry can be used to provide column cover and to give early warning of hostile activity. Security measures are employed to keep the enemy from learning of the movement or its destination once the column has begun moving. b. c. Terrain and weather permitting, aground security force (advance guard, flank security, and/or rear guards) are used to provide security. When terrain precludes the use of these ground security elements, air cavalry may perform these activities as part of the security mission. 3-55. Rail movement. a. Mission. The primary mission of train personnel and combat or security troops is to get the train to its destination. b. Concept. As long as the train continues to move, control remains with the train crew; however, if an ambush or firefight develops and the train is unable to disengage by movement forward or backward, the escort commander takes command and undertakes defense of the train with all available personnel. If there is no escort, the senior military member aboard takes command. Radio communications are used to call for assistance. Security detachments guarding the right of way have their own communication system which may be tied into the railway communication system, when required. c. Organization. Railway installations and rail traffic are secured by establishing defined areas of responsibility. Standing operating procedures on organization for rail movement are normally published by the highest level of command. Rail security is coordinated with area and tactical commands which provide support. d. Operations. Armored trains may be used for patrolling track where guerrilla activity may be expected. Armored trains operate tactically under orders of the appropriate military commander. Since the operation of an armored train is quite different from that of other trains, the military transportation service assigns a specially selected train crew. This crew coordinates the train movement with that of other trains and with proper regard for the tactical situation. Railway gondolas may be prepared for defense 3-41 160-739 - 94 - 3"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 by piling sandbags on the floor and at the sides and by mounting machine guns, mortars, and rocket launchers. These cars must not be placed next to cars containing gasoline, ammunition, or other flammables. Locomotives should be preceded by two or more cars loaded with sandbags, rocks, or scrap material for protection against mines and obstructions. On a single-track rail division subject to guerrilla attack, the positive-block method of operations is employed. In this method of operation, a following train is not permitted to enter a block until the preceding train has cleared it. This permits the train in the block, if attacked, to back up if necessary and to receive reinforcements by train from either direction. 3-56. Water movement and riverine operations. Counterguerrilla operations may be conducted in large inundated areas (lakes, coastal waters, flooded delta areas, and inland waterways) which are inhabited by large population segments and which have limited, or no, rail and road nets. The ability of the counterguerrilla force to operate in these areas is a requirement for successful missions. (See FM 31-11 and FM 31-12 for amphibious operations.) a. Mission and concept. Boats may be used to perform a variety of tactical as well as logistical tasks. Waterway movement of troops and supplies is planned and conducted in much the same manner as mounted movements on land; however, special characteristics of water transportation must be considered. The counterguerrilla force may participate in riverine operations along with host country regular forces (particularly naval forces), paramilitary forces, US Army waterborne transportation forces, and US naval forces. b. Organization. When a large waterborne force moves, it adopts a march formation similar to a ground convoy. Advance and rear guards in boats are organized. Flank security maybe provided by patrols in boats in adjacent streams or on foot on the banks. Unlike ground convoy procedures, movement is not necessarily in file or column formation. The formation depends upon the purpose of the movement, the strength of the friendly force, and the width of the stream. It is based on the same considerations as those for combat formations on land, to include control, security, flexibility, speed of reaction, observation, and fields of fire. c. Operations. (1) Waterways afford little cover and concealment. Power-driven boats are noisy and attract attention. Boats can be seen and fired on easily in daylight, but this disadvantage can be reduced by night movement and by traveling close to the stream banks where shadow and overhead branches aid 3-42"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 concealment. Boats must go to or near the shore to unload, thus affecting the reaction time in case of an ambush. Landing operations may be difficult because of unfavorable characteristics along the banks. Transported troops should be assigned firing positions on board their vessels for defense against ambush. The transported units should position the maximum number of crew-served weapons on board to engage enemy on the near bank or both banks of the waterway. (2) Combinations of blocking, attacking, and screening tactical actions can be devised by the counterguerrilla force utilizing the mobility of naval forces (river assault groups) and air assault units. Teamwork between ground forces moving along river banks, and supporting naval craft firepower and floating artillery, can result in successful operations against guerrilla forces in water areas. (3) The amount of time required for planning increases with the size of the force involved. Planning should be as detailed as time permits, but quick reaction is necessary to capitalize on current intelligence. Planning includes: (4) (a) Reducing all planning facets of embarking and debarking of troops and equipment to SOP. Integrating and combining plans for US, allied, and host country military forces and civilian agencies. (b) (c) Facilitating command and control means to unify command and coordination of fires and other support. (d) Reducing rehearsals to a minimum, based on habitual employment; reducing activities to SOP; reducing equipment and logistical requirements. Obtaining detailed intelligence from the population and civilian police. (e) (f) Obtaining information on currents and tides at H-hour, beach conditions, and conditions of banks or shores for exit routes. (5) Crew-served weapons transported on water craft must be in position at all times to engage guerrilla ambush forces. 3-57. Foot and air movement. a. Foot movement. Dismounted movements by small units are planned and conducted using the principles for patrolling; for 3-43"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 larger units, the principles for movement to contact will apply (FM 7-8, FM 7-10, and FM 7-20). b. Air movement. Air movements are an integral part of counter- guerrilla operations. The principles governing security of such movements are contained in FM 7-10, FM 7-20, and FM 90-4. 3-58. Border operations. a. While operations to control borders are normally a civilian security agency mission, the brigade may be required to participate in these operations by reinforcing or assuming responsibility for border surveillance and control. b. Brigades conducting or supporting consolidation or strike operations may become involved in border control activities. In some cases, the scope and combat requirements of controlling a border may make border operations more a tactical than a civilian security force problem, and may require the conduct of successive strike operations by the brigade in its area of operations. (1) Purpose. Border control operations require effective measures to secure extensive land border or seacoast areas and to preclude communication and supply operations (to include aerial resupply) between an external sponsoring power and guerrilla forces. (a) Concept. In Phase I insurgency, operations in border areas are normally a function of police, customs, and other government organizations. Armed and paramili- tary forces may assist these organizations, particularly in remote areas. In Phases II and III, denial of external support for the insurgency may require combat operations in border areas. These operations require close coordination and cooperation between the armed forces, paramilitary forces, and all government agencies involved. Physically sealing the border may not be possible since it could require the commitment of more government forces and materiel than overall national resources permit. Since placing forces and barriers at all possible crossings or entry sites maybe impossible, priorities should be established. Natural barriers must be used wherever possible. Using patrols, sensors, and obstacles in selected areas increases the effectiveness of natural barriers. Barrier and denial operations are established after careful consideration of the threat, the environment, and the location of the infiltrator’s probable targets and methods of oper- ation. 3-44"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 (b) (c) (d) Organization. National border forces may be com- posed of border police and guards and may include paramilitary forces and regular armed forces with supporting or direct responsibility for portions of the international border. Command and control. Border operations are planned, directed, and supervised from the national level. Authority to conduct these operations may be delegated to subnational and other area commanders. Structuring. Border task forces are tailored units designed to meet requirements in their assigned areas. They should contain sufficient combat support and combat service support elements to support operations for extended periods. (2) Operations. (a) Restricted zones or friendly population buffer zones can be established if needed. Either of these operations, which could require relocating many persons, must be carefully planned. Although armed forces may assist, civil authorities normally are responsible for planning and carrying out a relocation program. Forced relocation is held to a minimum. The 1949 Geneva Conventions prohibit forced population resettlement unless there is clear military necessity. (b) While specific portions of an international land border or shoreline maybe placed under effective surveillance and control by use of static security posts, reserve forces, ground and aerial observers, electronic listening posts, and patrols, the continuous surveillance and control of an extensive land border or shoreline is difficult. Since it may not be possible to place brigade forces at all the crossing or landing sites, a priority system for the sites requiring military forces is established. (3) Surveillance. Continuous and detailed surveillance is required to determine infiltration and exfiltration routes and support sites, frequency and volume of traffic, type of transportation, number and type of personnel, amount and type of materiel, terrain and traffic conditions, and the probable location of base areas and sanctuaries. Surveillance and control of extensive coastal areas normally require the use of coordinated ground patrols on the shoreline, coordinated offshore patrols, aerial surveillance, strategic observation posts along the shoreline, and an effective system of 3-45"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 licensing and identifying friendly military and civilian watercraft. (4) Military operations. Border units establish operational support bases at battalion and company levels to direct operations. Aviation, signal, engineer, and fire support augmentation usually is required. These are normally found in the brigade support base if not augmenting subordinate units. (5) Border control methods. Two operational concepts for the control of extensive land borders are the restricted zone and the friendly population buffer. (a) Restricted zone. Under this concept, an area of predetermined width along the border is declared a restricted zone. Appropriate proclamations are issued to the population so that everyone understands that any individual or group encountered in the zone will be considered as an element of the guerrilla force, paramilitary force, or similar organization. So far as practicable, the restricted zone is cleared of vegetation and other obstacles to observation over the area. Earth-moving equipment may be used for this purpose. Defoliants, if authorized, may also be used for this purpose, but this should be considered when no other method is feasible. Since the clearance of the zone along the entire border is normally not feasible, a priority of areas for clearance is usually necessary. The restricted zone is controlled by the use of ground and aerial observers, electronic sensor devices, listening posts, patrols, mines, and obstacles. It is preferable that these activities be conducted by host country civil police and paramilitary forces to economize on the available regular armed forces’ combat power which can be better utilized in tactical operations. (b) Friendly population buffer. The civilian population in the area of operations is redistributed as necessary to ensure that all civilians residing near the border are sympathetic to the host country government. This may entail the screening of all persons settled along the border, relocation of those persons of doubtful sympathy, and supplementary resettlement of the border area with friendly elements of the civilian population. This concept provides a potential informant net along the border, it provides friendly local civilians for employment in self-defense units to control the border area, and it denies potential civilian contacts and houses of refuge for use by the guerrillas in border-crossing activities. 3-46"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 Relocation of civilians is a sensitive legal and political issue and should be undertaken with host country authority in compliance with host country law. US personnel should not be actively involved. US relocation activities in an international conflict environment must comply with applicable provisions of Geneva Conventions IV. Relocation operations must be pre- ceded by detailed economic, social, psychological, and political preparation so the socio-economic stability of the area is not endangered by the shifts in population. The conduct of these operations without such preparation can result in such undesirable effects in the area as political instability, extensive unemployment, inequities in land distribution, inadequate public utilities, inadequate housing, and intermingling of population with conflicting religious beliefs and social mores. (6) Waterline borders. In addition to use of restricted zones and friendly population buffers, as discussed above for land borders, the surveillance and control of extensive coastal areas and shorelines normally require the use of: (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) Coordinated ground patrols on the shoreline. Coordinated offshore sea patrols of the shoreline and river delta areas. Reinforcing aerial, visual, and photographic surveillance of the offshore waters and the shoreline. Observation posts along the shoreline in the vicinity of river mouths, ground lines of communication, and accessible portions of the shoreline. An effective system of licensing and identifying all friendly military and civilian watercraft using the offshore waters. Effective, centralized control and coordination of all these activities. (7) Sanctuaries. Guerrillas may establish base camps and conduct cross-border operations from countries adjacent to the host country. They will take advantage of an international boundary to launch operations or evade pursuit with impunity. Commanders operating in border areas must respect the sanctity of international boundaries, but they can conduct combat operations against the guerrilla force once it crosses back over the border. Ambush patrols are an excellent means of dealing with guerrillas who attempt to use an international border as a sanctuary. 3-47"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 3-59. Urban operations. a. Operations in an urban environment require different emphasis and different techniques than those in rural areas. The presence of many people and the characteristics of the area influence both insurgent and government operations. During Phases I and II, these areas are usually unfavorable for guerrilla operations. Guerrillas will not normally fight in these areas; however, other insurgent elements in the urban areas may incite rioting, use terrorist tactics, or seize portions of the city and key facilities. Armed forces may be required to reinforce police in combatting riots and disorders provoked by the insurgents. Tactical operations may be necessary if the guerrillas take direct action to seize urban areas or critical installations within them. This may occur in smaller urban areas during Phase II, and may occur in large urban areas in the later stages of Phase III. (FM 90-10 discusses tactical operations in urban areas. FM 19-15 discusses civil disturbances.) b. The population density requires emphasis on the use of nonlethal weapons and the careful use of weapons of destruction when force is necessary. The application of “minimum essential force” to minimize loss of life and destruction of property requires detailed planning, coordination, and control. c. Covert insurgent activity is extensive in urban areas. The government must emphasize intelligence and police operations to counter clandestine organizational, intelligence, logistical, and terrorist activities. IDAD operations in urban areas maybe part of a consolidation campaign. d. Urban areas are critical and require a continuing IDAD effort whether or not they are included in a specific campaign. Military forces should participate in IDAD planning and operations in urban areas during all phases of insurgency to be prepared to assist other national security and law enforcement agencies if situations requiring military forces develop. (1) Operational environment. The characteristics of an urban area normally include: (a) A large, concentrated population. (b) Government facilities. (c) Industrial complexes.

(j) Educational centers. (k) Ethnic, religious, and economic groups. (l) Man-made features (multistory buildings and subter- ranean facilities). (m) Police force, paramilitary force, and other law en- forcement agencies. (2) Government activity. Urban areas need more government functions and services than rural areas. This requires more and possibly larger government organizations for operations. The activities and capabilities of all government agencies should be considered in planning and executing IDAD operations. (3) Subversive activities. A subversive element intent on destroying the government may strain the capabilities of local authorities. The insurgents will attempt to exploit local civilian organizations by subverting their goals and objectives. They will try to place them in opposition to the government. Terrorist activities and psychological operations will take place along with covert insurgent organizational, intelligence, and logistical operations. Police, internal security, and other government organizations will be high priority targets of the insurgents. (4) Operations. Operations require careful planning and coordination, particularly those operations involving application of force. Military forces designated to provide assistance, if needed, make plans and prepare to implement them. Military forces must be able to communicate with police and other agencies involved in the operations. They must collect and have readily available detailed information on area characteristics and critical installations. (5) Tactical operations. (a) Tactical operations may be required inside or near an urban area to defeat an insurgent attack. Any insurgent attempt to seize and hold an urban area will probably involve operations in nearby areas as well. When the police and other internal security forces can cope with the attack inside the urban area, military forces can best participate by establishing security around the urban area and by denying the insurgent reinforcement or support. When military forces are required to reinforce police or defeat insurgent forces inside the 3-49"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 urban area, operations must be closely controlled and coordinated. Military forces should be withdrawn as soon as police forces can handle the situation. (b) When an urban area has been seized by insurgent forces, an evaluation must be made from both a tactical and psychological perspective whether to recapture it using major military force or using other techniques. The amount of force and the specific techniques to be used to recapture the area are decided based on the probable psychological impact on the enemy, noncom- batant civilians, and friendly troops; the safety of civilians and friendly troops; the destruction of buildings; and the military forces available. The principle of “minimum essential force” will help reduce casualties in the noncombatant civilian population. (c) Riot control munitions can be used against targets so that military forces can close with and capture the enemy with minimum injury to the noncombatants. Operations may be in the form of assistance to civilian police. In any event, military operations must be coordinated with the civilian police.

General 4-1. Rear areas. The conditions of conventional conflicts differ greatly from an insurgency. This chapter discusses factors the commander must consider when planning counterguerrilla operations during a conventional conflict. The nature of the threat and tactics suitable to counter the threat are discussed. The material in this chapter is general and refers only to countering guerrilla activities in the rear areas of friendly forces engaged in conventional conflicts (Figure 4-1). Figure 4-1. Guerrilla rear action. 4-2. Threat. A guerrilla threat may not exist in these situations. However, if it does exist, it normally occurs in support of enemy forces engaged in conventional combat with friendly forces and occurs in the friendly force rear areas. (For further information on rear area operations, see FM 90-14.) 4-1"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 Section Il. Considerations 4-3. Guerrilla support. a. Since a major goal of participants in a conventional conflict is to gain control of territory through the use of regular armed forces, the forms of guerrilla activity change. Guerrilla operations in this case support the main effort of the enemy force by disrupting command, control, communications, and logistical operations of friendly forces. The guerrilla force also serves to cause commitment of friendly forces, best used in the close battle, to the rear battle. b. The ability of the guerrilla force to operate successfully does not rely on the attainment of popular support. Rather, the guerrilla force relies more on its ability to cause confusion in rear areas. 4-4. Guerrilla objectives. a. The objectives of a guerrilla force in a conventional conflict are: (1) (2) (3) (4) Disruption. The guerrilla force seeks to disrupt command, control, communications, and logistics operations and facilities. He may accomplish this by attacking key installations such as headquarters, communications sites, supply depots, maintenance facilities, and airfields. The guerrilla force also seeks to cut lines of communication and supply by interdicting supply columns, bridges, highways, and communications lines. Confusion. By destroying key facilities and interdicting lines of communication and supply, the guerrilla force causes confusion within the friendly force rear areas. The greater the amount of confusion created, the greater the ability of the main enemy force to discover and exploit weaknesses of the friendly force. Harassment. The guerrilla force remains a source of harassment as long as it operates in the rear area. It may not have to conduct continuous operations to achieve its goal. The mere knowledge that the guerrilla exists within the rear area, even though undetected, may be enough. Support. By disrupting, confusing, and harassing vital areas, the guerrilla supports the main enemy force by tying up friendly combat units in countering the threat. b. The guerrilla force may possess weapons, communications, and technology equal to or superior to the rear battle forces. It must be anticipated that nuclear, chemical, and biological, as well as conventional weapons and tactics may be utilized to achieve guerrilla goals. 4-2"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 4-5. Factors affecting operations. When considering the environment that the participants will be involved in, the commander’s plans for counterguerrilla operations must consider terrain and climate, as well as political, sociological, economic, and psychological factors. a. Terrain. Terrain affects men, equipment, trafficability, visibility, and the employment of NBC weapons. The terrain aspects of each area of operations must be evaluated to determine the impact on both guerrilla and counterguerrilla forces. Generally, guerrillas favor rough, inaccessible terrain with cover and concealment, affording them routes of escape and withdrawal if confronted or detected by counterguerrilla forces. Rolling, open terrain with less cover and concealment usually favors counterguerrilla forces in detecting and pursuing a guerrilla force. b. Climate. Each geographic area is analyzed to determine the effects of climate since no two areas have identical climates. Generally, a mild climate favors the guerrilla force since it induces less physical hardship, and may provide year-round vegetation for subsistence, cover, and concealment. The climate is also analyzed to determine the effect it will have on guerrilla operations as regards trafficability, visibility, and equipment. A cold climate usually favors the counterguerrilla force and hampers guerrilla operations since it increases the logistics required to support the guerrilla. The commander must also consider that the effect of seasonal variations can either increase or decrease his ability to conduct operations. c. Political factors. Political considerations are reduced. Gen- erally, the relationship between the counterguerrilla force and the civilian population is governed by restrictions and agreements that the US has with the government(s) of the country (or countries) in which the conflict takes place. In the event that the conflict takes place in enemy territory that is occupied, then the policies concerning interaction the the civilian populace will be formulated at theater level in consonance with guidance from the US government. It must be recognized that, in some situations, the political system of the area will be sympathetic to the guerrillas. d. Sociological factors. As with political factors, social factors are considered, but their impact is usually reduced. Usually, when US forces operate in friendly territory or liberate previously captured friendly territory, the sociological factors generally favor the counterguerrilla force. When US forces operate in captured enemy territory, then the sociological factors may favor the guerrilla force. In this situation, the guerrilla force may be receiving some support from the populace. 4-3"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 e. Economic factors. Generally, the counterguerrilla force plans its operations to minimize damage to the economic structure of an area. The standard of living must be recognized as a contributing factor to the psychological climate within the area. If the counterguerrilla force damages civilian property and economic structures, then it may have an adverse psychological impact. Usually, a poor economic climate will favor the counterguerrilla force since it will reduce the resources available to the guerrilla. The counterguerrilla force, on the other hand, is usually not dependent on the economy for its logistics. A strong economic climate usually does not favor either force. f. f. Psychological factors. A population that actively supports the counterguerrilla force greatly enhances the capability to detect guerrilla forces. Usually, this type of population is found when US forces operate in friendly territory or liberate areas opposed to the goals of the enemy force. Population support for the goals of the enemy force usually favors the guerrilla. That situation may occur when US forces operate in captured enemy territory. In most cases, however, the military objective of destroying the guerrilla force takes precedence over other considerations as long as operations are planned to minimize damage to civilian property. US forces must, in all cases, treat the civilian populace in a fair and just manner whether the people support the US presence or not. Inhumane treatment and criminal acts (murder, rape, or theft, even under stress of combat and with provocation) are serious and punishable violations under international law, the law of land warfare, and the US Uniform Code of Military Justice. 4-6. Applying METT-T. a. The commander of a counterguerrilla force in a conventional conflict plans his operations by analyzing the factors of METT-T. An understanding of the goals of a guerrilla force operating in rear areas and a general analysis of the environment of the area of operations provide a framework for planning. An analysis of the factors of METT-T will provide the specific information and indications to complete operational plans. b. Some of the major considerations of METT-T are: (1) Mission. (a) All aspects of the mission must be analyzed. In this analysis, the commander and his staff determine all specified and implied tasks: • Is the mission offensive? • Is the mission defensive? • Is the mission a combination of offense and defense? 4-4"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 (b) The authority a commander can exert within his area of operations is critical. If the command and support relationships are not clearly delineated in the initial order, then the commander must ensure that he receives that guidance prior to commencement of operations. The restrictions, limitations, and rules of engagement that the counterguerrilla force adheres to must be defined. These may include specific limitations regarding the use of firepower and types of weapons, or they may be general regarding the relationship of the counterguerrilla force with the civilian population. (2) Enemy. (a) Since the general goals of the enemy are known, specific information is gathered to produce a more complete picture. The capabilities of the enemy are examined. Some of the questions that should be answered are: • Can the guerrilla strike at will? • What is the size(s) of his unit(s)? Ž What type of weapons does he possess? • Is this a true guerrilla force consisting mainly of locally recruited indigenous personnel, or is this an enemy regular military unit specially trained and using guerrilla tactics? • Does he have fire or air support? • Does he have an offensive NBC capability? • How long can he operate in the area? (b) The commander examines not only guerrilla capabilities but also his vulnerable aspects, which include logistics and ability to remain undetected. Usually, guerrillas operating in a rear area then acquire logistical support from external sources, from captured equipment and supplies, and from the civilian populace. (c) External support by the enemy main force may occur through clandestine parachute drop or through waterborne, surface, or subsurface infiltration. If the guerrilla’s only source of resupply is external, then interdiction of his supply lines can decrease or halt operations as the guerrilla’s supplies are exhausted. (d) If the counterguerrilla force prevents the capture of friendly equipment and supplies, then again the 4-5"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 guerrilla must decrease and finally halt operations because of lack of supplies. (e) Reliance by the guerrilla on the civilian populace for support may occur more often in occupied enemy territory or in territories where the population favors the enemy force. Effective use of populace and resources control operations and psychological operations can reduce the logistical support received through the populace. (f) Because the guerrilla operates in rear areas, the difficulty of maintaining his lines of resupply usually keeps the size of his force at a relatively static level. If the counterguerrilla force can detect the guerrilla force, then it is only a matter of time until the guerrillas are fixed and engaged. The commander utilizes all available human intelligence (HUMINT), imagery intelligence (IMINT), and signal intelligence (SIGINT). In addition, the counterguerrilla force maximizes all information that can be gained from tactical operations to locate the guerrilla force. (g) Probable courses of enemy action are identified. What may be the least likely course of action for a conventional force may be the most likely for the guerrilla force. Often, the guerrilla strikes in this manner to gain the advantage of surprise. The counterguerrilla force identifies likely targets and takes measures to protect them. In addition, facilities and operations that may not seem likely targets may in fact be guerrilla targets solely because of their vulnerability. The counterguerrilla force commander must realize that destruction of numerous insignificant targets may cause more damage and confusion than the destruction or damage of one important target. (3) Terrain. The terrain consideration also includes consider- ation of weather. The weather is analyzed to determine its effect on both the guerrilla and the counterguernlla force. It is analyzed in terms of its effect on men and equipment, trafficability, and visibility. Since the guerrilla force may have the capability to use NBC, the effect of weather on NBC and smoke is also addressed. The terrain is studied in relation to the factors of OCOKA: Observation and fields of fire, Cover and concealment, Obstacles, Key terrain (to include likely guerrilla targets and base camps), and Avenues of approach or escape. The effect of those factors on the guerrilla and counterguerrilla forces is estimated, then the counterguerrilla force commander uses his estimate in 4-6"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 formulating his plan to attack the guerrilla weaknesses while protecting his own vulnerable areas. (4) Troops available. The counterguerrilla force commander may or may not have control over all forces in the rear area for employment in rear battle operations. Forces he may have might include combat, combat support, and combat service support units. In addition, the commander may have allied regular, paramilitary, and irregular forces under his control in certain situations. The counterguerrilla force commander will be provided guidelines and directives on the current joint and combined procedures for establishing an effective rear defense. He will effect liaison with all forces operating in his area of responsibility, fix specific responsi- bilities, and exercise overall control of defensive operations in response to a guerrilla threat. (5) Time available. The time available for planning must be wisely utilized. In most cases, the one-third rule may be applied. The commander uses one third of the available time for planning and leaves two thirds for subordinate planning and preparation. However, reaction to intelligence may require an immediate response. Operational planning is conducted as early as possible. Section Ill. The Threat 4-7. Type forces. a. The guerrilla action supports the enemy’s main forces by causing disruption, confusion, and harassment. These actions may be conducted by conventional or unconventional forces utilizing guerrilla warfare tactics. b. Conventional forces that may conduct guerrilla warfare include forces that have been cut off or that intentionally stay behind as their main force withdraws or retreats. These forces generally possess the weapons and equipment of the main enemy force. Their combat power may suffer from killed and wounded personnel and lost or damaged equipment, and they may have logistical difficulties. Another type of force may be an armored and/or mechanized unit with a mission to penetrate friendly rear areas and cause disruption, confusion, and harassment. Only if this force uses guerrilla warfare tactics is it considered a guerrilla force. If it continues to operate within the area that can be influenced by the main enemy forces, or if it utilizes conventional tactics, then it is not considered a guerrilla force. Airborne, heliborne, or waterborne light infantry forces may also compose a 4-7"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 guerrilla force if inserted to conduct guerrilla warfare operations (disruption, harassment, or confusion). c. In all cases where conventional enemy forces are using guerrilla warfare tactics, the counterguerrilla force commander must expect their degree of training, equipment, and sophistication to match that found in the main enemy force. 4-8. Special units. a. Unconventional warface forces that may conduct guerrilla warfare consist of special units trained specifically for guerrilla warfare and indigenous guerrilla forces sponsored by the main enemy force. Special units trained for guerrilla warfare usually have a primary mission to conduct guerrilla warfare operations against targets of opportunity with a follow-on mission to train an indigenous guerrilla force. b. Initially, these units may possess weapons and equipment equal to, or greater in sophistication than, US forces. The longer these units operate, the more they expend their assets. If they stay in the operational area for a prolonged period with no external resupply, then their level of efficiency decreases until US forces possess an equal capability. Their level of training is usually high, and these units are skilled in weapons, demolitions, communications, medicine, operations, and the ability to improvise when needed. These special units may enter a friendly area through the use of high altitude, low opening (HALO); high altitude, high opening (HAHO); or low level parachute techniques. They I.., also be skilled in and use overland and waterborne (both surface and subsurface) techniques to enter the area. c. In many cases, the indigenous guerrilla unit may be trained by special units inserted by the enemy force. Usually, the indigenous guerrilla force must rely on external support for its logistics requirements. In some cases, if the guerrilla force is not too large, then it may rely on captured or improvised equipment and materiel. d. The tactics used by both conventional and unconventional guerrilla forces remain the same. They are characterized by elusiveness, surprise, and brief, violent action. The techniques used by these forces usually consist of raids and ambushes. Depending on the composition of the guerrilla force, it may have aviation and fire support assets available to it. e. The counterguerrilla force commander must be aware that the guerrilla force may have NBC weapons available to it. Because of the capability of NBC weapons to cause a maximum amount of confusion with a limited amount of personnel, their use must be considered as a method that the guerrilla may employ. 4-8"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 Section IV. Tactics and Operations 4-9. Rear battle. Rear battle (FM 90-14) is defined as those actions, including area damage control, taken by all units singly or in a combined effort to secure the force, neutralize or defeat enemy operations in the rear area, and ensure freedom of action in the deep and close-in battles. The basic philosophy of rear battle doctrine is to maximize the capability of combat support and combat service support elements to defend themselves and render mutual support without requiring assistance from tactical combat forces. If a tactical combat force is assigned to the rear battle, it will be placed under the operational control (OPCON) of the rear battle officer. Once it completes the tactical mission and notifies the rear area operations center, it will be released to its parent unit. 4-10. Concepts. a. The concepts discussed in this chapter are geared to the needs of the tactical commander but can be used by the rear battle officer as well. In all instances, it is imperative that the principle of unity of command be maintained to minimize confusion and indecision that will occur if there is an inability to determine who is in command. The techniques used in rear battle operations are dependent upon METT-T. Some of these factors include the force composition, aviation assets, fire support assets, mobility, equipment, and size of the counterguerrilla force. These same factors must be examined regarding the guerrilla force. Generally, these techniques can be classified as either offensive or defensive. b. (1) Offensive techniques are used to locate, fix, and engage guerrilla forces. These operation include reconnaissance patrols, ambushes, attacks, encirclements, and movements to contact. (2) Defensive techniques are used to prevent disruption, harassment, or confusion. They are also used to minimize damage to a target if it is attacked. Preventive defensive techniques include movement security, security patrolling, and combat patrolling, among others. Examples of techniques designed to minimize damage once an action starts include base defense, counterambush, and reaction forces. c. The distinctions between offensive and defensive techniques are sometimes difficult to discern. Many offensive techniques can be used as a type of defensive technique and vice versa. (Offensive and defensive techniques are discussed in Chapter 3.) 4-9"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5 Combat Units Section I. General 5-1. Composition. The military force conducting counterguerrilla operations may not necessarily consist of only light infantry. This chapter discusses the various types of combat units that maybe available to the counterguerrilla force. The composition of the tactical force to be used in counterguerrilla operations — in other words, whether to use forces other than light infantry — depends upon the forces available and the threat that is faced. 5-2. Restricted firepower. Generally, because of political, economic, and sociological considerations that restrict the use of firepower, the farther the insurgency moves toward Phase III, the greater the combat power that can be utilized (Figure 5-1 ). In a conventional conflict, the same factors of availability of forces and the Threat are considered, but combat power can be applied at higher levels. Figure 5-1. Combat power can be applied at higher levels. 5-1"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 Section II. Counterinsurgency Environment 5-3. Type forces. The types of forces that maybe employed (other than light infantry) are infantry, airborne, air assault, mechanized infantry, armor, armored cavalry, and aviation. Terrain, enemy forces, and capabilities must be thoroughly assessed when deciding how to utilize these forces. The impact of these forces on the populace must also be assessed before they are employed. Normally, the majority of ground combat elements are organized to fight as light infantry. However, the proper use of other combat forces can provide the counterguerrilla force advantages. 5-4. Use of combat power. a. The primary consideration is that counterguerrilla operations support the host country’s IDAD plan. Extensive use of combat forces (other than infantry) in this environment is usually restricted because of limitations on the use of heavy weapons and their collateral damage. In addition, the guerrilla habitually chooses to operate from terrain that affords him protection (Figure 5-l). Usually, this type of.terrain is rough, inaccessible, and restrictive to ground vehicles. Military forces engaged in counterguerrilla warfare must make maximum effective use of all available assets, even if this means reorganizing and retraining as light infantry, utilizing organic combat vehicles in a supporting role for transportation only. b. The measure of effectiveness of an asset is contained in the concept of suitability. The extent to which various types of forces can be effectively utilized must be measured against the following criteria to determine if they will be suitable. 5-5. Impact on the populace. The commander must determine both the physical and psychological impact of using additional combat assets. In all cases, their use must fall within any restrictions stated in the rules of engagement. In addition, the psychological effect of the expanded use of firepower or assets might result in the perception that the government forces are losing or ineffective. 5-6. Meets the threat. The commander must ensure that the additional assets he plans to employ do not “overkill” the threat. If the threat is a light infantry force of company size working in groups of five to ten men, then it is not really suitable to have a battalion of armor arrayed against it. 5-2"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 5-7. Capability to accomplish assigned mission. a. The additional assets utilized must have the capability to perform tactical and IDAD missions. When determining if the additional assets do have the capability, the threat’s capabilities, structure, weapons, and level of training must be considered. b. In addition, the impact of the terrain on the force must be determined. All of these factors must be weighed to determine if the type of force that is going to be used will be an asset or a liability. These same factors, plus the psychological factor, determine if the force can support the accomplishment of the overall IDAD objective, which is to defeat the insurgency by winning the support of the populace for the host country government. (1) Airborne. (a) The essential difference between airborne forces and other combat forces employed against guerrillas is the capability of parachuting into an area. An airborne infantry unit conducts ground tactical operations in the same general manner as other infantry units. (b) Since airborne forces become light infantry upon insertion into an operational area, they can be used effectively in counterguerrilla operations. The primary advantage of using this type of force is that it enables the commander to position a large infantry force in a short period. In addition, when inserting small elements into a guerrilla-controlled or contested area, this method may provide a relatively clandestine means of insertion. Airborne operations are dependent on several factors, to include drop zone availability, airframe availability, terrain, and weather. In most cases, airborne operations can be used effectively to insert forces into suitable areas in all phases of insurgency. (For further information on airborne operations, see FM 7-10, FM 7-20, and FM 7-30.) (2) Air assault. (a) The helicopter provides battlefield mobility to the counterguerrilla force that usually cannot be matched by the guerrilla force. Air assault forces provide a valuable contribution through the tactic of vertical envelopment. They give the force commander the means to rapidly disperse and concentrate forces at the critical time and place and then quickly extract the force and employ it in a different area, if needed. The fundamental characteristic of air assault operations is 5-3"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 the use of helicopters to provide a tactical mobility advantage over the enemy. No other force on the battlefield can respond to a tactical situation and move considerable distances as rapidly as air assault forces. (b) Air assault forces can: • Attack enemy positions from any direction. • Strike objectives in otherwise inaccessible areas. • Overfly or bypass barriers and obstacles, to include NBC area contamination. Ž Conduct raids using helicopters to insert and withdraw forces. • Concentrate, disperse, or redeploy rapidly to extended their area of influence. • Provide the commander flexibility by allowing him to retain a smaller reserve and commit a larger portion of his force to action. • React rapidly to tactical opportunities and necessities. • Place forces rapidly at tactically decisive points in the battle area. • Provide surveillance over a wide area. (c ) Air assault forces, while suited to counterguerrilla operations, have limitations that must be considered: • Weather extremes that hamper or stop aircraft flights. • Helicopter lift capacity that restricts the type and quantity of supporting weapons and equipment that can be airlifted into the battle area. • Air lines of communications, once inserted. • Enemy tactical aircraft, air defense, and electronic warfare systems. • Reduced mobility on completion of air movement. Ž Increased vulnerability during loading and landing phases. (d) Flexibility, mobility, and speed are the key advantages of utilizing air assault forces. In counterguerrilla operations, the effective use of these advantages may be a critical function for the commander. While seeking to employ this type of force to maximize its strengths, the commander must also ensure that he realizes these 5-4"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 (3) operations have limitations and vulnerabilities. The advantages and limitations must be weighed in terms of the concept of suitability to determine if air assault forces should be used in a given situation. In almost all cases, air assault forces are well suited for use in all phases of insurgency. (For further information on air assault operations, see FM 90-4.) Mechanized infantry. (a) Mechanized infantry forces, fighting mounted, are not particularly suited for engaging guerrilla forces in combat action on restricted terrain. However, terrain permitting, the ability of infantry fighting vehicles and armored personnel carriers to move forces rapidly about the battlefield may give the counterguerrilla force a mobility advantage and a distinct firepower advantage. These advantages let the force close on guerrilla locations mounted and then complete its mission. (b) Because of the terrain the guerrilla habitually operates on, and the tactics he normally employs, opportunities to conduct traditional mechanized infantry operations against him are extremely limited. When this is the case, the mechanized force must be prepared to either abandon its carriers or use them only as a means of transport to the battle area where the mechanized force will fight on foot. Terrain permitting, the advantage in speed and mobility may allow for a larger area of operations than is within the capability of a totally light force of similar size. (c) In most cases, mechanized forces may have a role in: • Providing convoy escort. • Providing mobility for reserves. • Conducting show-of-force operations. • Assisting in base defenses. • Participating in an economy-of-force role when large areas require speed and mobility for adequate coverage while crossing NBC contaminated areas. • Providing limited armor protection against light small arms fire. • Participating in air assault operations. (d) Mechanized forces are normally suitable to be employed as a maneuver combat element only in the later stages of Phase III insurgency. 5-5"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 (e) In Phases I and II, dependening upon the situation, mechanized forces may be used for transport to the battle area because of their speed and mobility. (For further information on mechanized infantry employment, see FM 71-1, FM 71-2, and FM 71-3.) (4) Armor. (a) Armor forces are usually employed with accompanying infantry, but as with mechanized infantry forces, armor forces are not particularly suited for use as a maneuver combat element in a counterinsurgency environment. An armored force does provide firepower, protection, speed, and shock effect. These are usually advantages. Its capabilities are decreased and its vulnerabilities are increased in close and rough ter- rain. The difficulty in using armored forces is due to the restrictions placed on the use of firepower and increased vulnerability because of environment. Normally, the terrain that is involved is close, restrictive, and generally suited to light infantry forces. Further restrictions placed on what is generally considered its strongpoint — firepower — result in an overall increase in vulnerabilities and a decrease in capabilities when using an armored force in counterguerrilla operations. (b) In most cases, armored forces maybe used in: • Providing convoy escort. • Providing mobility for reserves. • Conducting show-of-force operations. • Assisting in base defenses. • Participating in an economy-of-force role when large areas require speed and mobility for adequate coverage. (c) During counterguerrilla operations, an armored force can usually be used as a maneuver combat element only in the later stages of Phase 111. In Phases I and II, its role is very limited. In these phases, armored forces are usually effective when supporting base defenses and show-of-force operations. (For further information on armor operations, see FM 71-1, FM 71-2, and FM 71-3.) (5) Armored cavalry. (a) The basic tasks of an armored cavalry unit are reconnaissance and security. Terrain permitting, such units may help the comma nder cover larger areas 5-6"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 because of their speed and mobility. The armored cavalry force will suffer the same vulnerabilities as mechanized infantry and armor if the members or the force remain tied to their vehicles. For these reasons, they can best be used for: • Securing bases. • Patrolling large areas. • Providing quick reaction forces and mobile reserves. (b) When properly utilized and tailored to fit the situation, armored cavalry can accomplish the specific missions listed in all phases of an insurgency. As the conflict progresses into Phase II, terrain permitting, armored cavalry units begin to take on a more traditional role and operate in a conventional manner. (For further information on armored cavalry operations, see FM 17-95.) (6) Aviation. (a) Types. Three types of aviation units maybe available for use in counterguerrilla operations: air cavalry troops, attack helicopter battalions, and combat aviation companies. Air cavalry troops. These perform the same missions of reconnaissance and security as ground cavalry. Because of its ‘greater mobility, air cavalry can reconnoiter and maintain surveillance over a much larger area than its ground counterpart. For this reason, depending upon the situation, air cavalry units are usually suited for employment in counterguerrilla operations in all phases of an insurgency. (c) Attack helicopter battalions. These provide highly maneuverable, aerial-delivered firepower. When these assets are used, the ordnance mix must reflect the type of threat being faced. In Phases I and II, the threat is usually light infantry, and a higher proportion of 20-mm rounds and 2.75-inch rockets is preferable to heavier antiarmor ordnance. As the conflict moves into Phase III, and if the guerrilla force starts to use mechanized or armored assets, a higher proportion of antiarmor ordnance maybe preferable. Attack helicop- ters use natural cover and speed to compensate for their vulnerabilities. They are suited for situations in which rapid reaction time is important or where terrain restricts ground forces. A vital element to the effectiveness of these units is the suppression of enemy air defense (b) 5-7"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 (SEAD). SEAD is any activity that neutralizes, destroys, or temporarily degrades enemy air defense systems in a specific area. Means of doing this include the employment of artillery or United States Air Force (USAF) and Army forces. Depending on the situation, attack helicopter units are usually suited for combat in all phases of an insurgency. (d) Combat aviation companies. These units give dismounted infantry tactical mobility by moving combat elements as the commander dictates. They can also provide critical supplies to areas when ground lines of communication have been interdicted or overloaded. Depending on the situation, combat support aviation units are suited to all phases of an insurgency. Because of their speed, mobility, and flexibility, aviation assets can provide an advantage if properly employed in most situations. (For further information on aviation operations, see FM 1-100, FM 17-50, and FM 90-4.) Section Ill. Conventional Conflict Environments 5-8. Concepts. In conventional conflict counterguerrilla operations, forces other than infantry take on larger roles. Their participation conforms more to the concepts outlined for their use in rear battle doctrine. In these environments, there are usually fewer restrictions on the use of firepower. 5-9. Considerations. a. b. c. d. Two major considerations, when employing forces other than infantry, are suitability and availability. Maneuver force mission suitability is usually discussed in terms of METT-T. The commander must weigh the advantages and disadvantages of using his force against the factors of METT-T. If the advantages outweigh the disadvantages, then the force is employed. The commander must make the most effective use of all the forces he has available. If a particular force would be more suitable but is not readily available, the commander should seek to procure it. If he cannot, then he maximizes the effects of those assets that he has available. In conventional conflicts, the use of combined arms is more effective in almost all situations rather than the use of any single type of combat force. 5-8"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 e. The primary considerations in planning counterguerrilla operations, using combined arms, are the factors of METT-T (FM 100-5). 5-9"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6 Combat Support Section I. General 6-1. Support units. a. b. c. d. In addition to combat units, reconnaissance and surveillance (R&S), fire support, intelligence, engineer, signal, military police, and air defense artillery forces are integrated into counterguerrilla force operations by the commander. This chapter explains the extent to which these assets are used, depending on their suitability to the situation. The role of reconnaissance and surveillance in counterguerrilla operations at all levels of conflict is of prime importance. Reconnaissance and surveillance units are critical; without them the chance of success in counterguerrilla operations is significantly decreased. The types of reconnaissance and surveillance units the counter- guerrilla force may have are its organic scout elements and any long-range surveillance units attached from corps and division. A brigade-size force may also have supporting intelligence collectors from the divisional combat electronic warfare intelligence (CEWI) battalion. These assets may include SIGINT collectors, remote sensors, and ground surveillance radars. The types of fire support units the counterguerrilla force may have are mortar platoons, antitank platoons or companies, field artillery units, tactical air support, naval gunfire support, and air defense artillery units. 6-2. Firepower constraints. a. In counterinsurgencies, firepower is usually restricted in order to limit damage. The use of fire support depends on its suitability and prevailing restrictions. b. The same restrictions do not usually exist to the same degree in conventional conflicts. The use of fire support assets in these conflicts is expanded since restrictions are relaxed. Suitability in these conflicts usually depends on the availability of fire support. 6-1"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 Section II. Reconnaissance and Surveillance Units 6-3. Techniques. a. Reconnaissance and surveillance are important techniques in gaining current and accurate intelligence on guerrilla forces. Current, accurate intelligence on the location, size, composition, equipment, and morale of guerrilla forces is an absolute necessity for successful counterguerrilla operations. b. While all tactical units have the capability to conduct reconnaissance and surveillance during operations, there are two units that are trained and organized to fulfill these specific tactical missions. These units are the scout platoon and the long- range surveillance unit (detachment or company). c. The scout platoon is organic to battalions; the long-range surveillance detachment is organic to divisions; and the long-range surveillance company is organic to corps. Each one works directly for its (division, corps) commander. Elements of these units may be attached to subordinate units, when required. d. If the reconnaissance and surveillance unit has vehicles, their use for purposes other than transportation is determined by the situation. In most cases, vehicles are used for transport to the general area where the operation is to begin. The operation is then conducted dismounted to enhance security. 6-4. Countering the guerrilla force. a. One method that may be successful in countering guerrilla forces is to divide the reconnaissance and surveillance assets into teams of three or four men. These teams are inserted into the operational area to “saturate” it. Since guerrillas travel in small units and then mass at a predetermined point prior to the attack, this tactic increases the chances of discovering one or more of these guerrilla units before they mass. The chance of this method being successful increases in proportion to the number of teams inserted and operating. b. The reconnaissance and surveillance element is divided into as many teams of three or four men as possible and deployed to cover an area. Of the seven teams deployed in this situation, only two (three and six) discover enemy units (figure 6-1). 6-2"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 Figure 6-1. The reconnaissance and surveillance element. c. This method should be used continuously to provide the counterguerrilla force greater opportunity to act rather than react. Once contact is made, the counterguerrilla commander has three immediate options available (Figure 6-2). 6-3 160-739 - 94 - 4"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 Figure 6-2. Three immediate options of the counterguerrilla commander. 6-4"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 d. e. f. In most cases, option 3 presents the best possibility for continued success if the counterguerrilla force commander has time constraints placed on his mission. It enables him to engage a portion of the guerrilla force and weaken its overall capability without losing a vital source of intelligence. Option 1 maybe best in situations where the counterguerrilla force does not have constraints placed on it and seeks to decisively engage a larger guerrilla force. In any case, the commander should wait until intelligence indicates that the guerrilla force has reached its assembly area or base camp before he reacts with maneuver forces. He should place his reconnaissance and surveillance elements in positions where they can best discover escaping guerrillas who have slipped through the blocking forces (Figure 6-3). Figure 6-3. Emplacement of R&S teams to discover fleeing guerrilla forces. g. He begins the process again if guerrilla units escape (Figure 6-4). 6-5"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 Figure 6-4. If guerrilla elements escape, R&S teams begin process again. h. The key to reconnaissance and surveillance units operating successfully in a counterinsurgency environment is the ability to remain undetected. This capability is the result of comprehensive training and experience. Communications equipment suitable for the mission is also a prime factor. It does no good to gather intelligence if the counterguerrilla force cannot use it in a timely manner. i. In conventional counterguerrilla conflicts, the use of the reconnaissance and surveillance units is more in line with their conventional missions. They can also employ modifications of the tactics described for a counterinsurgency. The mission of the scout platoon is to perform reconnaissance, provide limited security, and assist in controlling movement of the battalion or its elements. The types of operations a scout platoon can perform are route, zone, and area reconnaissance, and screening. 6-5. LRSU. a. The mission of the long-range surveillance unit {LRSU} (company or detachment) is to observe, record, and report enemy dispositions, facilities, and activities as well as battlefield conditions. b. The LRSU provides the commander with a dedicated, specially trained and equipped, and highly reliable human intelligence collection capability. A HUMINT collection unit provides the commander with the capability to gather timely, highly reliable information that does not require lengthy processing and analysis. The trained observer augmented with modem sensor 6-6"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 and communication systems is a reliable, flexible, and valuable information-gathering asset and is essential to conducting successful operations. c. The LRSU is organized, trained, and equipped to enter enemy areas to observe and report enemy movements and activities, as well as battlefield conditions. At night, or during other periods of reduced visibility, surveillance teams infiltrate by air, ground, or water to selected areas occupied by enemy forces or to areas where enemy activity is expected. d. While avoiding contact with the enemy and local civilians, these elements employ a variety of sensors and special purpose equipment to detect, observe, and monitor enemy activities and perform other specified tasks. As information is obtained, periodic reports are sent to the LRSU operations element utilizing secure, rapid-transmission communications equipment. This operational element provides the reported data to the military intelligence (MI) operation center for analysis and dissemination. At a predesignated time, or on order, surveillance elements are either extracted or evade enemy personnel to exfiltrate the enemy area, or they link up with friendly forces. Members of the surveillance elements are physically and mentally prepared to remain in enemy territory for extended periods to accomplish their mission. Section Ill. Fire Support Units 6-6. Fire support planning. a. The types of fire support units the counterguerrilla force may have available are mortar platoons, antitank platoons or companies, field artillery units, naval gunfire, tactical air, and air defense artillery units. b. An important factor in planning fire support is the restriction(s) placed on its use. In counterinsurgency environments, restrictions on its use (and damage caused) are greater than in conventional conflict environments. The commander operates under the concept of “minimum essential force” in counterinsurgency environments. He integrates his fire support into his tactical plan in accordance with prevailing restrictions, but always ensures he has adequate fire support for likely contingencies. In many cases, this means little or no use of fire support. c. This difficulty is not as great in conventional conflicts, but in these environments there are also restrictions. Usually these restrictions do not hinge on the amount of firepower used, but rather on collateral damage and coordination and control 6-7"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 measures. Additionally, fire support may not be readily available to the counterguerrilla commander because it may be committed to fight in the main battle area. d. Due to restrictions that may preclude the use of fire support, the counterguerrilla force is prepared to operate with little or no fire support. e. Since areas of operation are usually larger in counterguerrilla operations (than in more conventional operations), the counter- guerrilla force must not become tied to the range of its fire support. Operations will take place outside of fire support weapon ranges. In such cases, the commander provides for increased capability to reinforce or extract his engaged units, depending upon the situation. In all cases, restricted or not, the fire support forces available are ready to respond on short notice if restrictions are lifted or when needed for self-defense. 6-7. Mortar platoons. In a counterinsurgency, the firing elements of the mortar platoon normally occupy positions within the battalion operational support base. If elements are required to move to firing positions outside of the base, additional security must be provided. The mortar platoon is usually kept under battalion control and provides the most responsive indirect fire capability available to a battalion. Depending on the situation, the mortar platoon may or may not work from an established base in a conventional conflict. 6-8. Antitank platoons and companies. a. In an insurgency, the antitank units are not usually employed in their primary role. In those situations where no armor threat exists, consideration may be given to leaving the tube-launched, optically-tracked, wire-guided (TOW) missile in a secure staging area, either in or out of country, and using the crews as infantry. Since these personnel are usually not experienced in light infantry tactics, they may be best used as part of the security force for the OSB. b. In conventional conflict environments, the same situation may apply when no armor threat exists. However, because of the contingencies that the counterguerrilla force must be prepared to encounter, the TOWS must remain with the antitank unit while it is employed in a security role. These contingencies may include countering enemy armor penetrations, or a change in mission from rear battle to reinforcing frontline units, or even attacking or defending as part of the main force. 6-8"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 6-9. Field artillery units. a. b. As stated previously, the use of field artillery may be extremely limited because of restrictions on the use of firepower. In all cases, the application of firepower must reflect the principle of “minimum essential force.” The field artillery (FA) support normally provided to light infantry divisions consists of the 105-mm howitzer. Artillery of larger calibers maybe provided by artillery units augmenting the divisional artillery. If the counterguerrilla unit is not light infantry, its organic capability may consist of 155-mm howitzers. It is normal for artillery batteries to operate from the battalion OSB when the battalions are widely dispersed. Normal field artillery missions include direct support, reinforcing, general support, and general support reinforcing. There is a fire support coordination center at each level of maneuver command from company through brigade. They are manned by personnel from the brigade’s direct support FA battalion. c. When the situation permits the use of indirect fire support, FA units must be responsive and flexible. Timely and effective artillery fire in response to guerrilla activity may discourage subsequent guerrilla activity within artillery range. Quick reaction times and the capability to shift artillery fires over wide areas require a responsive and effective means of communication. To provide effective fire support, artillery is employed to obtain maximum area coverage with available weapons while retaining the capability to mass fires. In addition to supporting tactical operations, artillery may be positioned to provide area fire support to defend depots, logistical complexes, population centers, and other critical installations. Fires may be requested by self-defense forces, police, security elements protecting logistical complexes, and other support units, in addition to the supported tactical force. The senior field artillery officer at each echelon of maneuver command is designated the fire support coordinator. (FM 6-20 gives information on fire support coordination for indirect fires and fires from tactical air support. ) Fires must be closely coordinated not only with tactical operations in the area but also with civilian activities. e. Counterguerrilla operations normally dictate: d. (1) A greater decentralization of organic, attached, and re- inforcing fire support. (2) A reduced capability for brigade-level control and coordination of fires within the operational area. 6-9"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 (3) Greater security requirements for firing positions of indirect fire weapons to include planning of direct fires for defense. (4) A requirement to fire in all directions. (5) Provision for support to local defense forces and static security posts. (6) Discriminate use of fire support to avoid noncombatant casualties that would alienate the population and produce hostile attitudes toward the host government. (7) Close coordination with host country officials in the operational area. f. Lack of time may preclude the preparation of a formal, coordinated, and integrated fire support plan for every contingency; however, SOP should provide for all likely contingencies. Close liaison and continuous contact between the supported commander and the fire support coordinators provide the required coordination; however, in operations involving extensive employment of maneuver and support forces, such as in the final phase of an encirclement, coordination measures must be used to ensure that converging friendly units do not call fire upon one another. g. In conventional conflicts, the use of FA units is more along conventional lines. 6-10. Naval gunfire support. a. Naval gunfire support is delivered by ship batteries to support amphibious operations and maneuver units operating in coastal areas. When support is provided by naval gunfire, each gunfire ship is assigned the tactical mission of either direct support or general support. A ship in direct support normally supports a battalion and delivers planned and immediate fires. A ship in general support normally supports a brigade and delivers adjusted fires, or it may be assigned on a fire-mission basis to a subordinate maneuver unit. The counterguerrilla force commander must take into consideration the fact that naval gunfire is normally high velocity, low trajectory fire. b. In a counterinsurgency, the use of this asset will be governed by the same restrictions and the principle of “minimum essential force” that pertains to firepower when using field artillery. Generally, if FA can be used in an insurgency, naval gunfire can also be used, if available. The same is true of naval gunfire in conventional conflicts. One advantage of naval gunfire is that the supported ground units do not have to provide security to the firing batteries. 6-10"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 c. A liaison platoon (from the US Marine Corps) will normally be attached to the brigade to provide specialists and communications needed to control, coordinate, and recommend employment of naval gunfire or naval air. 6-11. Tactical air operations. Tactical air operations are flown by the US Air Force in support of counterguerrilla operations and cover six mission areas (some missions could be flown by Navy or Marine air assets) and special operations. a. b. c. d. e. Counter air. Objectives are to gain control of the airspace environment. Counter air operations protect friendly forces, ensure freedom to use the airspace to perform assigned missions and tasks, and deny use of airspace to a hostile force. The goal is air supremacy. Offensive counter air (OCA). Air operations seek out and neutralize or destroy hostile air forces at a chosen time and place. Offensive counter air is designed to seize the offensive at the initiation of hostilities, conduct operations in hostile air space, and neutralize or destroy hostile air forces and the infrastructure that supports their operations. Suppression of enemy air defenses. These operations neutralize, destroy, or temporarily degrade hostile air defensive systems in a specific area by physical or electronic attack. SEAD operations provide a favorable situation to perform missions effective y without interference from hostile air defenses. Defensive counter air (DCA). These operations detect, identify, intercept, and destroy hostile air forces attempting to attack friendly forces or penetrate friendly airspace. DCA defends friendly lines of communication, protects friendly bases, and supports friendly land and naval forces while denying hostile forces the freedom to carry out offensive operations. Air interdiction (AI). AI delays, disrupts, diverts, or destroys hostile military potential before it can be brought to bear effectively against friendly forces. These operations are performed at such distances from friendly forces that detailed integration of specific actions with friendly fire and movement forces is not normally required. AI attacks are usually executed against hostile surface forces; movement networks (including lines of communication); command, control and communications networks; and combat supplies. Interdiction can delay the arrival or buildup of hostile forces and supplies, disrupt the (1) 6-11"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 hostile scheme of operation and control of forces, divert hostile resources to other uses, and destroy forces and supplies. (2) AI is normally executed by an air commander as part of a systematic and persistent campaign. Although an AI campaign can bean independent air effort, an air commander normally coordinates the campaign with a surface force commander. A campaign is developed to limit the enemy’s mobility to maneuver forces, while forcing the enemy into high rates of consumption, and to create opportunities for friendly forces to exploit the disabilities produced by interdiction. The weight, phasing, and timing of interdiction attacks can provide friendly forces the opportunity to seize the initiative. (3) AI against targets which could have a near-term effect on friendly land forces is referred to as battlefield air interdiction. The primary difference between battlefield air interdiction and the rest of the air interdiction effort is the level of interest and emphasis the land commander places on the process of identifying, selecting, and attacking certain targets. Therefore, battlefield air interdiction requires joint coordination at the component level during planning, but once planned, battlefield air interdiction is controlled and executed by the air commander as an integral part of a total air interdiction campaign. f. Close air support (CAS). (1) CAS supports surface operations by attacking hostile targets near friendly surface forces. CAS can support offensive, counteroffensive, and defensive surface force operations with planned or immediate attacks. All such missions require detailed coordination and integration with the fire and maneuver plans of friendly surface forces. CAS missions require corridors to the battlefield, timely intelligence information, and accurate weapons delivery. (2) CAS enhances surface force operations by delivering a wide range of weapons and massed firepower at decisive points. It can surprise the hostile force, create opportunities for the maneuver or advance of friendly forces through shock effect and concentrated attacks, protect the flanks of friendly forces, blunt hostile offensives, and protect the rear of surface forces during rear battle maneuvers. 6-12 g. Special operations. (1) These operations influence the accomplishment of strategic or tactical objectives through the conduct of low visibility,"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 covert, or clandestine military actions. Special operations are usually conducted in hostile territory or politically sensitive areas and may complement friendly force opera- tions. (2) Virtually all aerospace forces have the potential for employment in special operations. Additionally, the Air Force organizes, trains, and equips unique units to conduct special operations as a primary mission. To execute special operations, forces are normally organized and employed in small formations capable of support actions and independent operations that enable timely and tailored responses throughout the spectrum of conflict. Special operation forces may conduct or support unconventional warfare, counter- terrorist operations, collective security, psychological operations, certain rescue operations, and other missions such as interdiction or offensive counter air operations. (a) Airlift. Airlifts deploy, employ, and sustain military forces under varying conditions, ranging from peace to war. As a combat mission, airlifts provide combat power through airdrops, extractions, and airlanding of ground forces and supplies. Through mobility operations, the joint or combined force commander can maneuver fighting forces to exploit hostile weaknesses. As a combat support mission, airlifts provide logistical support through the transportation of personnel and equipment. In peacetime, airlifts provide the opportunity to enhance national objectives by providing military assistance and civilian relief programs. In addition to the special operations noted above, aircraft assets may be used to dispense flares and leaflets as well as equipped with speakers or spraying apparatus for forest fire fighting. Airlifts, therefore, accomplish the timely movement, delivery and recovery of personnel, equipment, and supplies, and further military and national goals. Airlifts may be strategic or tactical. Strategic (intertheater) airlifts transcend the boundary of any one theater and are executed under the central direction of higher authority, normally in support of an overall effort. In contrast, tactical (intratheater) airlifts are performed within a theater of operations and support theater objectives through the rapid and responsive movement of personnel and supplies. (b) Aerospace surveillance and reconnaissance. The objectives are to collect information from airborne, orbital, and surfacebased sensors. Air Force surveillance and reconnaissance efforts are part of the national intelligence gathering effort and a systematic observa- 6-13"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 tion process. These operations provide much information that is key to the development of national security policy, force postures, planning actions, force employ- ment, and informed responses in times of crises. Surveillance operations collect information continuously from the aerospace and from the earth’s surface and subsurface. Reconnaissance operations are directed toward localizd or specific targets. Through surveillance and reconnaissance, varied data are collected, such as meteorological, hydrographic, geographic, electronic, and communications characteristics. The products of reconnaissance and surveillance operations have strategic and tactical applications in both peace and war. Strategic and tactical surveillance and reconnais- sance provide timely notification of hostile intent and actions as well as other information vital to the national command authorities and combat commanders. These operations are instrumental in identifying the composition and capability of potentially hostile forces. The Air Force also performs the following specialized tasks that could support counterguerrilla operations: (c) Electronic combat (EC). This is a specialized task performed by aerospace forces to control selected parts of the electromagnetic spectrum in support of strategic and tactical operations. Electronic combat involves actions to protect friendly electromagnetic capabilities and actions to neutralize or destroy hostile electro- magnetic capabilities. This enhances the ability of friendly war-fighting systems to achieve objectives, since the use of the electromagnetic spectrum can have a major impact on the success or failure of military operations. EC includes electronic warfare (EW), as well as elements of command, control, and communi- cations countermeasures (C 3 CM) and suppression of enemy air defenses. EW is military action using electromagnetic energy to determine, exploit, reduce, or prevent hostile use of the electromagnetic spectrum and also includes actions designed to retain the friendly use of that spectrum. C 3 CM involves defensive and offensive operations designed to deny information, protect friendly command, control, and communications (C 3 ), influence hostile actions, and degrade or destroy hostile C 3 capabilities. C 3 CM, supported by intelligence operations, integrates the use of operations security, military deception, jamming, and physical destruction. SEAD, as an essential element of the counter air mission, is aimed at gaining freedom of action to 6-14"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 perform Air Force missions by neutralizing, destroying, or temporarily degrading hostile air defense systems. EC contributes heavily to SEAD in counter air ob- jectives. (d) Psychological operations. This is a specialized task performed to support national objectives by influencing the attitudes and behavior of hostile, neutral, or friendly groups. All Air Force commands and agencies are responsible for the conduct or support of psychological operations. In planning and executing operations, commanders should consider the psycho- logical implications and opportunities inherent in every action, and they must make a concerted effort to ensure that the signals transmitted are perceived as intended. Both action and inaction may communicate information (which can exert influence and may be used to reinforce actions) to enhance perceptions of capabilities or to influence others to support friendly objectives. Depending on the medium of communications, national objectives, and planned actions, various psychological efforts can be created to reinforce operations. These include planned communications through electronic means or printed material; a show of force or demonstrations of superiority; an attack on a specific, significant target for psychological effect; actions to harass and disrupt hostile operations; surprise, shock action, and deception; or humanitarian operations. (e) Weather service. This is a specialized task performed to provide timely and accurate environmental infor- mation to support strategic, tactical, and mobility operations. The Air Force weather service gathers, anal yzes, and provides meteorological and exoatmo- spheric data for mission planning. Environmental information is essential in conducting both airspace and surface operations. The environmental information provided by the weather service directly influences the decision process for employing forces, including the selection of weapon systems, routes, targets, and delivery tactics. 6-12. Air defense artillery units. a. Air defense is a combination of all active and passive measures to counter hostile air operations. In an insurgency, the hostile air threat may be minimal. In this case, consideration maybe given to leaving air defense artillery (ADA) weapons in a rear staging 6-15"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 area and using ADA personnel as additional security forces for the OSB. If this course of action is selected, the ground commander must recognize that an insurgency does not equate to a low intensity air threat. If ADA personnel are separated from their ADA weapons, even a minimal air attack could result in the destruction of friendly force units. Commanders must plan for such an attack by hostile or sympathetic forces. When the guerrilla force has the potential to mount an air threat, or when an air threat exists, the ADA assets must maintain the capability to immediately react to an air threat. In a conventional counterguerrilla environment, the roles of ADA are along more conventional lines. (For further information on air defense operations integrated with infantry operations, see FM 44-1, FM 44-3, and FM 44-18.) b. 6-13. Military intelligence. a. b. c. d. e. Intelligence at the tactical level is of prime importance in counterguerrilla operations. MI elements organic to units conducting counterguerrilla operations are CEWI battalions at division level, and staff sections at brigade and battalion level. Because of the decentralized nature of counterguerrilla operations, portions of the divisional assets are usually attached to brigades, which may in turn attach elements down to the battalions. The tactical MI assets coordinate their efforts with the existing intelligence operations (either host country or US) in their area. Division level MI assets are not capable of long-term, area-oriented intelligence production without echelons above division support and assistance. However, they are capable of short-term collection and production efforts in support of the immediate tactical operation. The tactical MI element has two missions that are conducted simultaneously. The first is to collect, process, and analyze intelligence information. There are two categories of information which are important to combat commanders: combat information and intelligence. Combat information is raw data that can be used for fire and maneuver decisions as received without further processing, interpretation, or integration with other data. Combat information is seldom developed above battalion level and is a component part of intelligence. Intelligence is data requiring some form of validation, integration, and comparison with other data (or analysis) before it can be used or fully exploited. The disciplines from which these data are produced and collected are HUMINT, SIGINT, and IMINT. In a counterguerrilla 6-16"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 conflict, the area of HUMINT provides a large portion of available intelligence. Technical and electronic assets, if used effectively, can provide additional data to enhance the counter- guerrilla force’s intelligence advantage. Some of these assets include ground surveillance radar, sensors, communications intercept (COMINT), and side-looking airborne radar (IMINT). f. The second mission of the tactical MI element is to attempt to disrupt or delay the enemy’s intelligence collection processes. The discipline that accomplishes this task is termed counterintelligence. These functions include deception operations, OPSEC, COMSEC, and are for the most part performed by HUMINT assets. (For further information on intelligence operations, see FM 34-1 and FM 34-10.) 6-14. Engineers. a. Engineer assets are usually found at division level and above. Portions of these assets maybe attached to brigades and, in turn, to battalions. The engineer system is divided into four areas: mobility, countermobility, survivability, and general engineering. b. Mobility is geared toward improving the movement of maneuver units and movement of critical supplies. It is oriented toward reducing or negating the effects of obstacles. Examples of mobility operations include landing zone construction, reduction of roadblocks, construction of combat trails, and assault bridging. c. Countermobility is designed to reduce the enemy’s mobility and effectiveness. This is generally done through the installation of obstacles. Some obstacles may destroy targets; most enhance or complement weapon effectiveness. Examples of conventional obstacles are minefield and wire entanglements. d. Survivability is the development of protective positions. Examples include construction of perimeter defense positions in operational support bases. e. General engineering missions do not contribute directly to committed maneuver units. Examples of general engineering missions include: (1) Improving and maintaining essential supply routes. (2) Developing areas for essential logistics. (3) Replacing assault (or destroyed) bridges with tactical bridging. (4) Carrying out civic action. f. Engineer units spend most of their time and effort in survivability and general engineering tasks, even though all four areas of 6-17"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 g. h. engineer effort may be addressed. When determining if a project should be considered general engineering or one of the other three, the rule is: if the project’s primary purpose is to help the populace, it is general engineering; if its primary purpose is to enhance tactical operations, it will usually be one of the other three categories. Since engineers spend much of their time interfacing with the populace during civic action projects, it is essential that engineers understand the impact of their role on national objectives. Engineer assets can be used to enhance infantry combat operations as a contingency mission. Engineers are effective in their primary mission and are utilized in their secondary role as a last resort. Engineers can be used as trainers on basic mobility, countermobility, and survivability skills to include identification of booby traps, mines, and obstacles, and emplacement construction. They contribute more toward the achievement of national goals as civic action units than as additional infantry. Engineers may be used as infantry: (1) During attacks on the operational support base. (2) When all tactical units are committed and a threat arises. (3) As reserves in situations where the guerrilla threat has already caused the commitment of all available reserves. (For further information on engineer operations and capabilities, see FM 5-100.) 6-15. Military police. a. Military police units can perform their normal functions as an effective part of any counterguerrilla force. They provide a distinct advantage in police operations in the populace and resources control program. Military police operate in conjunction with host country civil and military police. b. Military police functions include: (1) Populace and resources control operations. Operations in an insurgency may involve extensive police activities to control the host country populace and materiel resources, including screening, identification, registration, enforcement of curfews, operation of patrols and checkpoints, and investigation of crime. (2) Intelligence operations. Since guerrilla activities often overlap with criminal activities, police activities over a period of time can develop informants and informant nets which produce intelligence and/or information. 6-18"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 (3) Searches. Military police may conduct searches in support of cordon-and-search operations. They support the operation by manning or supervising search parties, securing persons or property captured, and evacuating prisoners. (4) Securing ground lines of communication. Military police assist in securing lines of communication by road and aerial patrolling, establishing traffic control points, escorting convoys, and conducting reconnaissance in their area of responsibility. In securing such lines, they may apprehend individual guerrillas and their supporters and are prepared to combat small groups of guerrillas or to act as a fixing element until combat units arrive. (5) Physical security. Military police provide physical security to individuals and installations. This may include designated communities. (6) Prisoners. Military police process, secure, and evacuate captured persons and detainees in accordance with FM 19-40 and Department of the Army directives. c. A division usually has one military police company. Depending on the situation, elements of this company may be attached to brigades or battalions. They are utilized more in consolidation operations than in strike operations. (For further information on military police activities, see FM 19-1, FM 19-4, and FM 19-40.) 6-16. Signal. a. Radio is the primary means of communication in counterguerrilla operations. Planning and implementing radio communication nets for the brigade and its maneuver battalions may become highly complex. The brigade signal officer is prepared to advise on the capability of available communications means to support each course of action being considered. Providing sufficient radio communication equipment to conduct operations is a high priority in an insurgency. Aerial and ground relay stations may be required to extend the range of FM equipment. Since the brigade communication platoon has no reserve from which to provide augmentation, special communication needs of brigade elements are provided either by redistributing equipment or by augmenting the table of organization and equipment. For long-range radio communications between battalion operational support bases and patrol bases, communi- cation support teams may be required. b. c. Extensive use of radio expands the communications security problem. Never consider the guerrilla force too unsophisticated to acquire communications intelligence. Conventional communica- 6-19"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 tions security measures are employed with emphasis on changing operational codes frequently at the lower tactical echelons. Secure voice nets will be provided from company level upward. d. Long-range reconnaissance and surveillance units employed in counterguerrilla operations should possess a secure, long-range capability to enhance communications security. e. Use of multichannel, high-frequency voice radio, radio teletype, and tactical satellite should be considered for interconnecting operational support bases. Normally, isolated relay stations cannot be established in the counterguerrilla operational environment. Therefore, the location of operational support or patrol bases, and distance between them, seriously impacts on the signal unit’s ability to provide a reliable multichannel communi- cations system. The signal officer considers this when presenting his recommendations on base locations to the commander. f. The composition of the signal element committed in support of the counterguerrilla force is modified to meet mission and situation requirements. The signal support element can be either in direct support or attached. A direct support role is desirable as it affords the signal officer wider latitude and greater flexibility to meet changing support requirements. In all cases, the supported unit provides security forces for the signal elements.

This chapter explains how combat service support assets enhance tactical operations and assist the unit in accomplishing its overall mission. These assets include medical, supply, transportation, maintenance, and personnel and administration. They normally operate from bases that support unit tactical operations. Depending on the size of the unit, these assets may be organic or attached. 7-2. Essential elements. Combat service support units include those elements essential to the tactical mission and those elements that are not essential but are necessary to the normal functioning of the battalion and brigade.’ Usually, only essential combat service support assets are located at the battalion operational support base. Both essential and nonessential tactical support elements can be found in the brigade’s support base. Section Il. Bases 7-3. Operational support. a. Operational support bases are usually established by battalions. In consolidation operations, these bases are usually semipermanent. In strike operations, they operate only as long as required by the unit mission. The primary function of the battalion operational support base is to support tactical operations. It may provide a staging area for operations; a command, control, and communi- cation center; a limited logistics base (battalion combat trains); a fire support base; or a combination of all these functions. The specific support functions it provides are determined by availability and necessity. These bases have the minimum personnel necessary to operate and provide security. All nonessential personnel — those not crucial to the tactical mission — are positioned in the brigade support base. b. Battalion operational support bases provide certain advantages. They: (1) Establish a government presence in the area of operations. 7-1"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 (2) Aid in limiting guerrilla mobility in the immediate vicinity. (3) Provide a measure of security to populated areas close by. c. These advantages are secondary and do not take precedence over the primary function — to support tactical operations. 7-4. OSB location. a. When selecting a location for the operational support base, several factors are considered. The location includes an area large enough to meet the unit’s requirements, and it is on defensible terrain. If the unit is going to use the base for fire support, it provides the maximum possible coverage for indirect fire weapons. The operational support base is located far enough away from population centers to preclude civilian interference with operations and to minimize the possibility of the population center becoming a collateral target. b. c. The OSB is located so that it has, as a minimum, two methods for resupply. For example, if the primary means for resupply is by air, it should also have a secondary means, such as a road, in case weather precludes the use of aircraft. d. The brigade support base provides deployed battalions with command, control and communications facilities; logistics support (brigade support area, BSA); staging areas; and intelligence activities. The support base is usually in a secured area within a government-controlled area. It is larger than a battalion operational support base. The brigade support base provides essential tactical and necessary operational support to deployed battalions, and also provides a rear location for nondeployed elements of the deployed battalions (battalion field trains). e. All combat service support elements, whether operating from battalion or brigade bases, ensure that their activities support the overall national objective. Since these operations usually involve more interaction with the civilian populace than tactical operations, it is necessary that personnel involved understand the host country’s culture. Such understanding will preclude any action that might be detrimental to the accomplishment of the overall national objective. The combat service support assets that normally operate from the battalion operational base are medical and supply. These same assets can also operate from the brigade support base. The additional assets of transportation, maintenance, and personnel and administration usually operate from the brigade support f. 7-2"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 base. The size of the element at each base depends on the situation. A nonessential element (operational or tactical) should not be deployed from the home station. It is important that deployed elements consist only of those assets critical to the tactical or operational functioning of the unit. Section Ill. Use of Assets 7-5. Support levels. Most of the combat service support assets are found at division or higher level and are attached to brigades as needed. In some cases, the brigade may receive a larger portion of the division assets than normal if the situation requires it. 7-6. Medical. a. The mission of medical units is to conserve the fighting strength of the counterguerrilla force by preventive medical and sanitary measures and by appropriate medical and surgical treatment. In support of the IDAD effort, medical units and personnel may provide medical assistance, advice, and training to host country medical personnel. These units may also provide limited medical support to the local populace on a temporary basis. However, such support is conducted under the auspices of the host country and to the credit of that government. b. Aidmen are at company level and give emergency medical treatment within their capabilities. They also ensure that patients who need to be evacuated are properly prepared and promptly moved. c. An aid station is usually at battalion level. In counterguerrilla situations, the station is within the battalion operational support base. Aid station functions include: (1) Receiving, recording, examining, and sorting patients and returning the physically fit to duty. (2) Giving emergency medical treatment and preparing patients for evacuation. (3) Providing limited medical support through military civic action programs, as designated. d. The battalion aid station is normally supervised by a physician or physician’s assistant. e. Depending on the seriousness of the wound, the patient maybe moved directly to a division treatment station in the brigade support base, or to a corps level hospital. Evacuation to medical 7-3"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 f. support facilities may be by ground, but aeromedical evacuation is the preferred means in counterguerrilla operations because of the speed and security of aerial transport. Any medical facility maybe bypassed, and the patient evacuated to a higher level when his condition warrants it and the means of evacuation permit. Evacuation of wounded personnel does not take precedence over mission accomplishment. 7-7. Supply. a. b. c. d. e. f. Supply units in counterguerrilla operations, as in conventional operations, provide all necessary classes of supplies to units involved in tactical operations. Since the battalion operational support base is as small as possible and provides only a limited logistics base, the supply element at battalion is small. A majority of the combat trains are collocated with field trains in the brigade support base, so it is essential that supply lines to battalions be maintained. Both aerial and ground resupply are considered to ensure a backup system in case one method is disrupted. The brigade usually receives its portion of divisional assets, but it may be augmented with additional assets as required. Resupplying tactical units must not set a pattern. Resupply should not occur on a regular basis, but only as requested by tactical units. Unit messes normally do not operate from battalion operational support bases. Unit mess teams may move to (and operate from) battalion bases for short periods to improve morale, or prepare hot meals in the brigade base and transport them to the battalion base. In some cases, local procurement of foodstuffs maybe authorized to help bolster the local economy. Currently prescribed supply systems and procedures can adequately support counterguerrilla operations with minor variations. (For further information on supply operations and procedures, see FM 29-51.) 7-8. Transportation. a. Transportation requirements are classified as tactical and nontactical. Tactical transportation deals with the repositioning of men and materiel in the battle area, and is directly associated with combat. Nontactical transportation deals with the movement of men and materiel in a noncombat action. 7-4"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 b. c. d. e. f. g. There are two major types of transportation means available to counterguerrilla forces: ground and air transport. Less common means of transportation are railroads, watercraft, and pack animals. Tactical transportation by aviation assets is preferred because of their speed and flexibility. On occasions when aviation assets are not suitable, ground transportation is utilized. Ground transpor- tation requires increased security. Once the unit is repositioned, soldiers move on foot to accomplish their mission. Aviation units are located at division level and above. Aircraft for brigade operations, or below, are attached or placed in support of the using unit(s). Nontactical transportation is accomplished by either aviation or ground transportation assets. Generally, nontactical transportation is used to move supplies and equipment, and for medical evacuation. Ground transportation assets may be organic to units at company and above. The use of ground transport is dependent upon distance, security, terrain, and availability of routes, among other factors. Ground transportation requests are made through S4 channels, consolidated at brigade S4, and forwarded to the division transportation officer. He assigns priorities and missions to the division’s track assets or requests additional assets from corps. Requests for Army aviation are made through S3 channels and forwarded to the assistant division aviation officer. He assigns priorities and missions to the division’s combat aviation brigade or requests additional assets from corps. (For further information on transportation assets and operations, see FM 55-2.) 7-9. Maintenance. Maintenance involves all actions to keep equipment operationally ready or to restore it to that status. Battalion maintenance elements are located at the OSB (combat trains) and the brigade support base (field trains). In addition, maintenance contact teams from the maintenance unit supporting the brigade (forward support maintenance company or forward support battalion) will also be located with the OSB. Maintenance doctrine (fix as far forward as possible) is modified slightly in an effort to keep the OSB as small as possible. As a result, most maintenance, other than minor repair or replacement of parts, will take place at the brigade support base in a relatively secure area. (For further information on maintenance operations, see FM 29-2, FM 29-23, and FM 29-30-1.) 7-5"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 7-10. Personnel and administration. a. To remain an effective fighting force, the counterguerrilla unit requires personnel and administrative support. Most, if not all, of this support function occurs in the field trains at the brigade support base. The adjutant (S1) is at the battalion operational support base with the supply officer (S4). The S1 is responsible for headquarters management of the battalion base as well as S1 functions and liaison with brigade. The headquarters commandant is with the field trains of the battalion in the brigade base. This arrangement keeps the battalion base as small as possible. b. c. Personnel and administrative support for counterguerrilla operations is essentially the same as in conventional operations. Administrative operations remain relatively the same and flexible to support the situation. (For further information on personnel and administrative support functions, see FM 7-20 and FM 71-2.) 7-6"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 APPENDIX A Subsurface Operations Section 1. General A-1. Type facilities. a. This appendix explains how guerrillas may use natural caves or construct underground facilities in the course of their operations. These may be used for command and control centers, logistical staging areas, hospitals, or even fortifications. b. The larger underground facilities may be complex. Caves may have many large chambers connected by passageways, while tunnel systems may have many large rooms joined by intercon- necting tunnels. Underground facilities may be wired for electricity and communications and may even have pumping stations for supplying air to lower levels. A-2. Tunnel uses. Tunnels may be dug with zigzags and sumps to lessen the effects of small arms fire, explosives, and gas inside them. Some tunnels and rooms, or passageways and chambers, may contain concealed exits to allow guerrillas to hide or escape if the complex or cave is penetrated while others may be booby-trapped to kill intruders. Tunnels and caves are difficult to detect from the air or ground, and their construction may make them impossible to destroy with conventional ammunition. Tunnel entrances are normally covered by fire from another point in the complex. a. Guerrillas may use tunnels in penetration operations to gain access to restricted areas. In built-up areas they may infiltrate through sewers, or tunnel from the basement of a nearby building, or subway tunnel, or sewer to their target. When they are below the target, they may either construct an exit and penetrate the target from below or fill the tunnel with explosives and blow up the target. b. Tunnels may also be dug in the basements of safehouses for use as escape routes if a house is compromised. c. Tunnels are used for approach and escape. They are used to obtain access to caves and underground bunkers for use as firing positions and protection against indirect fires. They are also used as a common method of storing food and materials in underground caches. Some tunnel complexes are large enough to house underground hopitals and base camps. A-1"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 Section Il. Tunneling A-3. Categories. Tunnels vary from the simple to the complex. They are categorized as hiding holes, access and escape routes, underground base areas, fortified base camps, and bunkers. a. Hiding holes. There are three basic types of holes used by (1) guerrillas. They are classified more by their location than by their construction. Methods of construction and dimensions can be expected to vary, depending on the area of operations. Bamboo hole. This is easily and quickly camouflaged (Figure A-1 ). The entrances to the holes differ as do the techniques of camouflage. Most of the entrances are within the edge of a bamboo clump or dense thicket or just outside the edge. The hole cover, or trapdoor, contains camouflage material. Some have pieces of cut bamboo or other vegetation affixed to the top of the door. The edges of the door fit snugly into the structure of the entrance. Other entrances may be covered by spreading materials over them. Figure A-1. Under bamboo hole. A-2"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 (2) Air hole. Another characteristic common to small tunnels is the air hole, which is normally made from a hollow piece of bamboo or pipe 3 to 4 inches in diameter and inserted into the tunnel and camouflaged on the surface. (a) (b) The air hole is the only telltale indicator in a beach hole or tunnel. It differs from the bamboo hole in that it is constructed in sand or dirt and constructed from cut timbers (Figure A-2). It does not depend on roots to add rigidity to the roof. The entrance is hard to locate as it is often buried under afoot of loose sand or dirt; however, it can be found by first finding the breathing tubes. Some air holes are a continuation of the supports that hold up local buildings. Other air holes may be exposed by pulling up plants that grow nearby. Figure A-2. Beach hole. (3) Water entrance hole. This hole or tunnel (Figure A-3) is located near a small stream or beside an old bomb crater filled with water. These holes have no door and depend on natural growth to hide the entrance. Sometimes the entrance is completely submerged. A-3"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 Figure A-3. Water entrance hole. b. Access and escape routes. Guerrillas use tunnels to infiltrate or exfiltrate an area. They may lead to villages, roads, or highly fortified bunker systems (Figure A-4). Figure A-4. Access and escape routes. A-4"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 c. Base area. This may house a command post, ordnance shop, or hospital. This type of tunnel system is not-as common as the ones found in a fortified village or used as access or escape routes. It is normally deep in guerrilla-controlled areas. This type of tunnel complex may have several rooms, such as a 4- by 6-foot area or a large 10-foot-square area with a 15-foot ceiling. They may also include electric lighting or other comfort features (Figure A-5). Figure A-5. Underground base area. d. Base camps. These are usually fortified positions. They may consist of a-central bunker, 18 inches above ground, and tunnels 100 to 150 meters long, connecting outer bunkers to the central bunker. All bunkers have overhead cover and camouflaged firing apertures. They are positioned to provide mutual support and deny observation of the entire complex from any one location on the ground (Figure A-6). A-5"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 Figure A-6. Fortified base camps. e. Bunkers. Entrances are often in a house under a bed or table, and have an outside exit. In many cases, bunkers are constructed with walls up to 3 feet thick. The floor is below ground level. The roof is normally constructed of logs covered with dirt, mud, or rock from 3 to 6 feet thick. Sometimes, small logs (driven 3 to 6 feet into the ground and extending upward to roof level) serve to reinforce the walls. In some cases, the bunker maybe constructed entirely of concrete. Most often, bunkers have one overt entrance and one or more covert exits. The primary use of bunkers is to provide cover and concealment. Firing apertures are just above ground (Figure A-7). A-6"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 Figure A-7. Bunkers. A-7"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 A-4. Construction methods. a. b. c. d. e. f. g. h. One feature common to almost all tunnel complexes is the method of excavation. The laborers are divided into a number of work units and assigned tunnel sections. The units are placed approximately 20 meters along the axis of the planned tunnel. Each unit then digs a well or shaft to the desired depth where a working area is enlarged. From this point, the units begin digging toward each other. As the tunnel grows, the workers are formed in a line to pass the soil out the excavation shaft. The soil is spead evenly over the ground or a road, or under the forest canopy to prevent detection. Once the main tunnel has been excavated, the shaft is filled and camouflaged. As the tunnel becomes more extensive, lower levels may be constructed to provide additional room and better protection. The degree of sophistication is dependent upon the purpose of the tunnel and frequency of its use. Most of the tunnels constructed by guerrilla forces are hiding places or escape routes; therefore, they may be extensive in length, but not complex in design. Whether their construction is complex or not, care is taken to provide security throughout the tunnels. False corridors are constructed, as are trapdoors and false walls. A U-shaped design is often formed to give the impression that the corridor is a deadend when actually a trapdoor leads to the way out. Most tunnel systems require substantial planning before actual construction. The systems are never haphazard. The tunnel is reinforced by reveting or other means. One common method used to reinforce tunnels is to coat walls with mud 3 to 6 inches thick and build fires throughout the system to bake the mud, turning it into a ceramic texture. Tunnel systems are usually not constructed in a straight line. They will follow a zigzag or serpentine course. This type of construction is used to protect the occupants from small arms fire in the event that tunnel systems are detected and breached. Tools for digging are simple. A bucket and pick or shovel are the main tools. Common methods of illumination include carbide lamps, flashlights, candles, and in larger complexes, small, fuel-driven generators for electric lighting. Secrecy of location is considered of utmost importance. All means are taken to camouflage and conceal tunnel entrances. Often, tunnels are hidden in tombs, walls, floors, or under water. Extensive use of booby traps and mines should be expected in and around tunnel complexes. Some common booby traps are mortar and artillery duds rigged for command detonation. These may be buried or suspended in trees in the immediate vicinity. Hand A-8"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 grenades and homemade bombs are used to booby-trapdoors and hatches. Poisonous snakes may be placed in tunnels to inflict casualties. A-5. Detection of tunnels. a. The first step in detecting or locating tunnels is to reduce a large geographical area of interest to a smaller area of probable locations. This can be accomplished by studying general indications of probable tunnel locations. b. Some indicators that tunnels are being employed by guerrilla forces are: (1) Movement of guerrillas in a specific direction after being spotted by aircraft. (2) Sniper fire occurring from areas where there are no obvious avenues of withdrawal. (3) Vegetable gardens far from places of habitation. (4) Operations where guerrillas inflict casualties at relatively long range and disappear without making close contact or being detected by friendly forces. (5) The smell of burning wood or food cooking in an area lacking habitation. c. Conventional air photography produces results if the appearance of the surface and vegetation are changed from normal. This requires skilled personnel to interpret photos. In a jungle environment, air photography may be prohibited because dense vegetation, such as double or triple canopy jungle, obscures the ground. d. Once determined that a specific area may contain a tunnel system, there are several indicators that are helpful in detecting tunnels. Visual inspections often disclose the general area of a tunnel, but not its precise location. The key to finding a tunnel system is the application of common sense to the situation. A platoon or company should be assigned a small search area, never larger than a 1000-meter grid square for a company. These small areas are picked based on intelligence reports or past actions of the guerrilla force. The unit searches every square meter of the area. Some visual indicators usually found are: (1) Worn places on trees that the guerrilla uses as handholds. (2) A small trail, much like a game trail, through the brush into a clump of small trees. (3) Cut trees, although not a sure sign. A-9 160-739 - 94 - 5"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 (4) Limbs tied near tree top to conceal the use of a tunnel from aircraft. (5) Slight depression in or around a group of small trees. (6) Air holes, a sure indicator. (7) A lone individual, especially a female, in the area. (8) Fresh cooked food with no one attending the site. (9) Fresh human feces in an area. e. All these indicators are good. However, in different areas they may vary. The places to look for indicators are in the corners of hedgerows, in the corners of village huts, and in the secluded corners of trails and streams. The enemy often hides in these places so he can see while not being seen. Additionally, hiding in these places allows those who put the finishing touches on the camouflage to escape undetected. The guerrilla is aware of the danger of establishing a pattern. However, he must have a location that provides him with observation as well as concealment. So look for observation posts that allow him to move into or out of an area undetected. f. Occasionally, the specific location of a tunnel can be obtained by interrogating the local populace, or prisoners of war (PW) who may have occupied, or helped in digging, the system. Because of the method of constructing a tunnel system, that of using an excavation shaft to reach the level of the tunnel and then closing this shaft once the tunnel is completed, the individual may not be able to locate an entrance or exit unless he has seen or used the completed tunnel. A-6. Tunnel search operations. b. a. Entering an area where a tunnel complex is located requires a methodical approach. Security to the flanks and rear is imper- ative. The size of the objective area of operations determines the strength of the unit assigned the search mission. Basically, the unit, company, or platoon is task-organized for tunnel operations. c. A company is divided into three elements: security, search, and reserve. (The headquarters element remains with the security element.) (1) Security — one platoon plus headquarters element to cordon search area. A-10 (2) Search — one platoon to search immediate area for tunnels. The search element is subdivided into search and security teams."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 (3) Reserve – one platoon to assist in cordon and reinforce as necessary. d. A platoon is divided into three elements: (1) Security – one squad plus headquarters element to cordon area. (2) Search – one squad to search area for tunnels. The search element is subdivided into search and security teams. (3) Reserve – one squad to assist in cordon and reinforce as necessary. e. The techniques of deliberate search are centered around the rifle squad. Each squad is divided into a security and a search team. f. A slow, methodical search is conducted in the area of operations. Once assigned a search area, the squad systematically searches every square meter. The security element move toward the limits of the search area. Once a hole (tunnel) is discovered, the security element surrounds the area while the search team prepares to destroy or neutralize the hole (tunnel). A-7. Special equipment. The unit may require the following special items to perform tunnel operations: a. b. c. d. e. f. g. Mine detector — used to detect ammunition and weapon caches. Grenades – fragmentary, chemical (CS) gas, chemical (HC) smoke, while phosphorus (WP), and concussion types. Grenades should not be used after friendly forces have entered a tunnel. Demolitions — used to destroy tunnel system. Because of the complexity of charges needed to destroy some tunnel complexes, an engineer team should support the search unit. Also, the large amount of demolitions required for some operations may present unique logistical problems, especially in a jungle environment. Air generator — used to force smoke into tunnel complex. Flashlights — to search tunnels. Weapons — caliber .45 pistol should be used inside tunnels. The pistol has good stopping power and is effective at close range. Loudspeaker — used to call enemy from tunnels. A-11"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 Section Ill. Destroying Underground Facilities A-8. Four-step process. a. b. c. d. e. f. The destruction of a tunnel is a four-step process, beginning (1) with a soldier firing one or two magazines from a rifle into the tunnel entrance. This has a tendency to discourage the enemy from staying close to the entrance. After gaining the attention of the guerrillas, they are told to vacate the hole or tunnel or be killed. They may give up without a fight, saving not only the efforts of killing, but of excavating the hole or tunnel for weapons and documents. If this fails, breaching operations are used(2). A grenade is placed on the entrance cover to gain access. The entrance cover is removed in this manner to minimize the effects of any attached booby traps. Once the entrance cover is destroyed, the following measures are used (depending on the mission): (1) Insert grenades (3), fragmentary or concussion, to kill the guerrillas. Ensure that the grenades are cooked-off prior to throwing them in the hole or tunnel. (2) Insert a combination of HC smoke and CS chemical grenades. This serves two purposes: HC smoke may reveal the locations of other entrances or exits, and CS may force the guerrillas to evacuate the hole or tunnel. Captured guerrillas become a source of intelligence in finding other holes or tunnels. The last step (4) is the entry of soldiers to ensure that all weapons and documents are recovered and all enemy dead, wounded, and living are removed. The hole or tunnel is thoroughly searched for small compartments built to hide weapons and ammunition. If a tunnel complex proves to be extensive with bunkers and large rooms, it is cleared systematically. Bunkers are destroyed or occupied to prevent the enemy from reoccupying them through another tunnel. Do not clear more bunkers than friendly forces can hold. Deliberate search techniques emphasize where to look for the enemy (locations that provide him with observation, cover, concealment, and an escape route). When the soldier learns what to look for (a game trail, worn and cut trees, an air hole, human feces, a depression, fresh food, a lone individual), any of these indicators is likely to trigger a mental alert that the enemy is not far away. After the tunnel is searched, it is destroyed with explosives. A-12"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 A-9. Neutralization-demolition procedures. a. Tunnels. Since each tunnel system differs in size and construction, a different quantity and placement of explosives is needed for each type. (1) The use of block explosives to destroy a tunnel system has a disadvantage: all the explosive power is concentrated at one point. Thus, the destruction is localized, and often portions of the tunnel are unaffected. However, a large (10-to 12-pound) block of explosive tamped against the ceiling may cause an entire tunnel to collapse. (2) Advantages of block-type explosives are the ease of em- placement, ease of procurement, and feasibility of aerial resupply. Also, block or satchel charges are effective in the destruction of bunkers, sunken living quarters, and under- ground rooms. Cratering charges are also effective for underground rooms. Short tunnels can be destroyed effectively by block explosives. (3) The shaped charge in tunnel destruction is successful when used in specific circumstances. A shaped charge placed underground in the middle of a tunnel complex, and aimed downward, destroys an area of the tunnel complex around and above the charge. Also, a shaped charge placed in a deep complex and aimed upward results in extensive destruction. (4) Another effective method of tunnel destruction utilizes bangalore torpedos placed throughout the tunnel length (regardless of depth). The constant length of explosives throughout the tunnel ensures complete destruction. The bangalore (5 feet long) is adaptable to the twists and turns in tunnels. Each tunnel where it can be pushed through). A disadvantage of bangalore torpedoes is the logistical problem arising from their size and weight. There may be a problem with resupply if large quantities are used to completely destroy a tunnel system. Bunkers. Underground living quarters, bunkers, and underground hideaways can be destroyed by block or satchel charges placed strategically inside the room. The following are examples of structures and the size and placement of charges. b. (1) Bunkers dug into the ground and covered by dense brush (average size 4 by 8 by 4 feet) can be destroyed with 3 pounds of explosives placed next to a wall.

Cities and towns are vulnerable to urban guerrilla violence because they are the focus of economic and political power. In many cases, public utilities and services can be disrupted. Thus, the government may appear to have lost control of the situation. The concentration of a large number of people in a relatively small area provides cover for the guerrilla. However, the insurgent may find support only in certain areas of a town or city. In any event, the urban guerrilla lives in a community that is friendly to him or, as a minimum, is too frightened to withhold its support or inform on him. He has a close relationship with leaders and other guerrillas, and may have a communication system using women and children who also provide cover for other activities. b. c. The urban guerrilla can operate more boldly than his rural counterpart as reflected by his tactics: the sniper complements the more conventional ambush and often replaces it; explosive devices may be used either as instruments against the community or more selectively against individuals or groups. The availability of large numbers of people ensures that crowds can be assembled and demonstrations manipulated with comparative ease. The presence of women and children restricts counterguerrilla force reactions, and a clumsy reaction may ensure a major incident that provides the guerrilla with propaganda. Publicity is easily achieved in an urban area because no major incident can be concealed from the local population even if it is not widely reported by the news media. Terrorist successes may be exploited to discredit the ability of the police, counterguerrilla force, and civil government to provide protection and control the guerrillas. d. e. The urban guerrilla cannot, like his rural counterpart, establish bases and recruit large military units. He is an individual, a member of a relatively small group, relying on the cover afforded by the people of the city and on terror to avoid betrayal. Individuals and small groups are effective in an urban environment because it is easier for them to avoid capture; if captured, however, the terrorist may be able to expose only two or three persons to government or counterguerrilla forces.

They include: (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) Disrupting industry and public services by strikes and sabotage. Generating widespread disturbances designed to stretch the resources of the counterguerrilla force. Creating incidents or massing crowds in order to lure the counterguerrilla force into a trap. Provoking the counterguerrilla force in the hope that it may overreact and provide hostile propaganda. Fomenting interfactional strife. Sniping at roadblocks, outposts, and sentries. Attacking vehicles and buildings with rockets and mortars. Planting explosive devices, either against specific targets or indiscriminately, to cause confusion and destruction, and to lower public morale. Ambushing patrols and firing on helicopters.

Operations against urban guerrillas may vary from a passive policy designed to curtail terrorist activities so that community life can continue (under certain constraints), to an active policy which involves the counterguerrilla force seeking out and capturing or killing the enemy. The level of intensity at which operations are conducted will be determined by the civil govern- ment. Fighting the urban guerrilla is generally a police mission. However, the military counterguerrilla force commander maybe required to assist the police in this mission or even take it over. The techniques used are similar to the ones used in rural areas. Before operations are conducted, information must be obtained about the enemy, his environment, and operations (Appendix H). The techniques include: (1) Installation of base defense (Appendix E). (2) Roadblocks and checkpoints (Chapter 3). b. B-2"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 (3) Crowd dispersal (FM 19-15). (4) Cordon-and-search operations (Chapter 3). (5) Patrols (Chapter 3 and Appendix D). B-4. Minimum force. The principles remain the same, but in an urban environment the principle of minimum force becomes more important and is directly related to the rules of engagement. There is greater danger of injuring or killing innocent civilians in heavily populated centem. Since there are seldom large groups of guerrillas in cities, there are no base camps, only safe houses. Opportunities for deliberate attacks rarely occur. Just as fighting guerrillas in a rural environment, killing or capturing the urban guerrilla is not a mission that is quickly accomplished. B-3"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 APPENDIX C Ambush Patrols Section 1. General C-1. Purpose of ambushes. The ambush patrols discussed in this appendix are combat patrols with missions to establish and execute ambushes to harass or destroy targets and/or capture personnel and equipment. Ambushes generally are executed to reduce the guerrilla’s overall combat effectiveness. Destruction is the primary purpose of an ambush since guerrillas killed and/or captured, and equipment and/or supplies destroyed or captured, critically affect the guerrilla force. Harassment, the secondary purpose, diverts guerrillas from other missions. A series of successful ambushes causes the guerrilla force to be less aggressive and more defensive; to be apprehensive and overly cautious; and to be reluctant to go on patrols and move in convoys or in small groups. C-2. Types of ambushes. a. There are two types of ambushes. A point ambush involves patrol elements deployed to support the attack of a single killing zone. An area ambush involves patrol elements deployed as multiple, related, point ambushes. b. An ambush is categorized as either hasty or deliberate. A hasty ambush is an immediate action drill, an action of a combat patrol wilth little or no information. When information does not permit detailed planning required for a deliberate ambush, a hasty ambush is planned. In this case, the ambush patrol plans and prepares to attack the first suitable guerrilla force. A deliberate ambush is planned as a specific action against a specific target. Detailed information of the guerrilla force is required: size, nature, organization, armament, equipment, route and direction of movement, and times the force will reach or pass certain points on its route. Deliberate ambushes are planned when: (1) Reliable information is received on the intended movement of a specific force. (2) Patrols, convoys, carrying parties, or similar forces establish patterns of size, time, and movement sufficient to permit detailed planning for the ambush. c.

It establishes and executes ambushes as opportunities arise. Section Il. Attack Fundamentals C-3. Three elements. Surprise, coordinated fires, and control are basic to a successful ambush. C-4. Surprise. Surprise must be achieved or else the attack is not an ambush. Surprise, which distinguishes an ambush from other forms of attack, allows the ambush force to seize and retain control of the situation. Surprise is achieved by careful planning, preparation, and execution. Guerrillas are attacked in a manner they least expect. C-5. Coordinated fires. All weapons, including mines and demolitions, are positioned, and all direct and indirect fires are coordinated to achieve: a. Isolation of the kill zone to prevent escape or reinforcement. Surprise delivery of a large volume of concentrated fires into the kill zone to inflict maximum damage so the target can be assaulted and destroyed. b. C-6. Control. a. Close control is maintained during movement to, occupation of, and withdrawal from the ambush site. The ambush commander’s control of all elements is critical at the time of target approach. Control measures provide for b. (1) Early warning of target approach. (2) Withholding fire until the target moves into the kill zone. (3) Opening fire at the proper time. (4) Initiating appropriate actions if the ambush is prematurely detected. (5) Lifting or shifting supporting fires when the ambush includes assault of the target. (6) Timely and orderly withdrawal to an easily recognized rallying point. C-2"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 c. Personnel conducting the ambush remain still and quiet while waiting for the target to appear. They may have to forgo smoking; endure insect bites and thirst in silence; and resist sleeping, easing cramped muscles, and performing normal body functions. (Ambushes should have a rest plan and a mess plan.) When the target approaches, they do not open fire before the signal is given. Section Ill. Planning C-7. Flexibility. a. An ambush is planned and prepared using troop leading procedures. Planning considerations include whether the ambush is to be a deliberate ambush or a hasty ambush. In a deliberate ambush, more target intelligence is available to permit planning for every course of action at the target. Planning for a hasty ambush includes tentative plans both for the types of targets that may be ambushed and for varying situations. Both plans are flexible enough to allow modifying, as appropriate, at the ambush site. All plans are rehearsed in detail. b. Planning provides for the following: (1) Simplicity. Every soldier must thoroughly understand what he is to do at every stage of the operation. In an ambush, more so than in other operations, the failure of even one soldier to perform exactly as planned can cause failure. (2) Type of ambush. The type of ambush affects the organiza- tion, number of men, and amount of equipment and communications required. (3) Deployment. Each possible formation is considered for its advantages and disadvantages. C-8. Manner of attack. The attack may be by fire only (harassing ambush) or may include assault of the target (destruction ambush). C-9. Size of ambush force. The force is tailored for its mission. Two men may be adequate for a harassing ambush. A destruction ambush may require the entire unit (squad, platoon, company). a. Organization. An ambush patrol is organized in the same manner as other combat patrols to include a headquarters, an assault element, a support element, and a security element. The assault and support elements are the attack force; the security C-3"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 element is the security force. When appropriate, the attack force is further organized to provide a reserve force. When an ambush site is to be occupied for an extended period, double ambush forces may be organized. One ambush force occupies the site while the other rests, eats, and tends to personal needs at the objective rail ying point or other concealed location. They alternate after a given time, which is usually 8 hours. If the waiting period is over 24 hours, three ambush forces maybe organized. Equipment. The selection of equipment and supplies is based on the: (1) Mission. b. (2) Size of the guerrilla force. (3) Means of transportation. (4) Distance and terrain. (5) Weight and bulk of equipment. d. c. Routes. A primary route is planned which allows the unit to enter the ambush site from the rear. The kill zone is not entered if entry can be avoided. If the kill zone must be entered to place mines or explosives, care is taken to remove any tracks or signs that might alert the guerrillas and compromise the ambush. If mines, mantraps, or explosives are to be placed on the far side, or if the appearance of the site might cause the guerrillas to check it, then a wide detour around the kill zone is made. Here, too, care is taken to remove any traces which might reveal the ambush. Also, an alternate route from the ambush site is planned. Site. Maps and aerial photographs are used to analyze the terrain. When possible, anon-the-ground reconnaissance is made. As far as possible, so-called “ideal” ambush sites are avoided. Alert guerrillas are suspicious of these areas, avoid them if possible, and increase vigilance and security when they must be entered; surprise is even more difficult to achieve in these areas. Instead, apparently unlikely sites are chosen, when possible. Considering this, an ambush site must provide: (1) Fields of fire. (2) Concealed positions. (3) Canalization of the guerrillas into the killing zone. (4) Covered routes of withdrawal (to enable the ambush force to break contact and avoid pursuit). (5) No exit route for the guerrilla force. e. Occupation of the site. As a rule, the ambush force occupies the ambush site at the latest possible time permitted by the tactical C-4"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 f. g. h. situation and the amount of site preparation required. This not only reduces the risk of discovery but also reduces the time that soldiers must remain still and quiet in position. Positions. The unit moves into the ambush site from the rear. Security elements are positioned first to prevent surprise while the ambush is being established. Automatic weapons are then positioned so that each can fire along the entire killing zone. If this is not possible, they are given overlapping sectors of fire so that the entire killing zone is covered. The unit leader then selects his position, located where he can see when to initiate the ambush. Claymore mines, explosives, and M203 grenade launchers maybe used to cover any dead space left by the automatic weapons. All weapons are assigned sectors of fire to provide mutual support. The unit leader sets a time by which positions are to be prepared. The degree of preparation depends on the time allowed. All men work at top speed during the allotted time. Camouflage. Camouflage is important. Each soldier must be hidden from the target. During preparation for the patrol, each soldier camouflages himself and his equipment and secures his equipment to prevent noise. At the ambush site, positions are prepared with minimal change in the natural appearance of the site. All debris resulting from preparation of positions is con- cealed. Movement, noise, and light discipline. Movement is kept to a minimum and the number of men moving at a time is closely controlled. Every man is as quiet as possible, especially at night. Light discipline is rigidly enforced at night. Smoking is forbidden at night and is closely controlled in the day. C-10. Execution. a. b. Three signals, often four, are needed to execute the ambush. Audible and visual signals, such as whistles and pyrotechnics, must be changed often to avoid establishing patterns. Too frequently, use of the same signals may result in their becoming known to the enemy. A guerrilla might recognize a signal and be able to react in time to avoid the full effects of an ambush. For example, if white star cluster is habitually used to signal withdrawal in a night ambush, an alert guerrilla might fire one and cause premature withdrawal. A signal by the security force to alert the patrol leader to the guerrilla’s approach may be given by: (1) Arm-and-hand signals. (2) Radio, as a quiet voice message, by transmitting a prearranged number of taps, or by signaling with the push-to-talk switch. C-5"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 (3) Field telephone, when there is no danger that wire between positions will compromise the ambush. c. A signal to initiate the ambush, given by the patrol leader or a designated individual, may be a shot or the detonation of mines or explosives. The ambush should be initiated with a mass casualty producing weapon (Claymore antipersonnel mine or M60 machine gun). A signal for lifting or shifting fires, if the guerrilla force is to be assaulted, may be given by voice command, whistles, or pyrotechnics. All fire stops immediately so that the assault can be made before the guerrilla can react. d. e. A signal for withdrawal may also be by voice command, whistles, or pyrotechnics. C-11. Fire discipline. This is a key part of the ambush. Fire is withheld until the signal is given, then immediately delivered with the heaviest, most accurate volume possible. Properly timed and delivered fires contribute to the achievement of surprise as well as to destruction of the guerrilla force. When the guerrillas are to be assaulted, the lifting or shifting of fires is equally precise. Otherwise, the assault is delayed, and the guerrillas have an opportunity to recover and react. C-12. Withdrawal to the objective rallying point. a. The objective rallying point is far enough from the ambush site so that it will not be overrun if the guerrilla force attacks the ambush. Routes of withdrawal to the objective rallying point are reconnoitered. If possible, each person walks the route he is to use and picks out checkpoints. When the ambush is to be executed at night, each person must be able to follow his route in the dark. On signal, the unit quickly but quietly withdraws to the objective rallying point, reorganizes, and begins its return march. b. c. If the ambush was not successful and the unit is pursued, withdrawal may be by bounds. The last group may arm mines, previously placed along the withdrawal route, to further delay pursuit. C-13. Four ambush techniques. a. A near ambush is a point ambush with the assault element within reasonable assaulting distance of the kill zone (less than 50 meters). Close terrain, such as jungle and heavy woods, may C-6"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 require this positioning. It may also be appropriate in open terrain in a “rise from the ground” ambush. A far ambush is a point ambush with the assault element beyond reasonable assaulting distance of the kill zone (beyond 50 meters). This location may be appropriate in open terrain offering good fields of fire or when attack is by fire for a harassing ambush. b. c. A harassing ambush is an ambush in which attack is by fire only. d. A destruction ambush is an ambush which includes assault to close with and decisively engage the guerrilla force. Section IV. Point Ambush Formations C-14. Positions. a. A point ambush, whether independent or part of an area ambush, is positioned along the expected route of approach of the guerrilla force. Formation is important because, to a great extent, it determines whether a point ambush can deliver the heavy volume of highly concentrated fire necessary to isolate, trap, and destroy the guerrillas. b. The formation to be used is determined by carefully considering possible formations and the advantages and disadvantages of each in relation to terrain; conditions of visibility, forces, weapons, and equipment ease or difficulty of control; force to be attacked; and overall combat situation. c. This section discusses formations developed for the deployment of point ambushes. The formations are identified with names that correspond to the general pattern formed on the ground by deployment of the attack element. They include: (1) Line formation (two techniques, Paragraph C-15). (2) L-formation (two techniques with variations, Paragraph C-16). (3) Z-formation (Paragraph C-17). (4) T-formation (two techniques, Paragraph C-18). (5) V-formation (two techniques, Paragraph C-19). (6) Triangle formation (closed; open with variations, Paragraph C-20). (7) Box formation (two techniques, Paragraph C-21). C-15. Line formation. a. The attack element is deployed generally parallel to the guerrilla force’s route of movement (road, trail, stream). This positions the C-7"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 attack element parallel to the long axis of the kill zone and subjects the guerrilla force to heavy flanking fire. The size of the force that can be trapped in the kill zone is limited by the area which the attack element can effectively cover with highly concentrated fire. The force is trapped in the kill zone by natural obstacles. mines (Claymore, antivehicular, antipersonnel), demolition’s, and direct and indirect fires (Figure C-1). Figure C-1. Line formation: harassing or destruction ambush. A disadvantage of the line formation is the chance that lateral dispersion of the force maybe too great for effective coverage. The line formation is appropriate in close terrain that restricts guerrilla maneuver and in open terrain where one flank is restricted by mines, demolitions, or mantraps. Similar obstacles can be placed between the attack element and the kill zone to provide protection from guerrilla counterambush measures. When a destruction ambush is deployed in this manner, access lanes are left so that the force in the killing zone can be assaulted. The line formation can be effectively used by a “rise from the ground” ambush in terrain seemingly unsuitable for ambush (Figure C-2). b. C-8"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 Figure C-2. Line formation: destruction ambush with access lanes for assault of target. c. An advantage of the line formation is its relative ease of control under all conditions of visibility. C-16. L-formation. a. The L-shaped formation is a variation of the line formation. The long side of the attack element is parallel to the kill zone and delivers flanking fire. The short side of the attack element is at the end of, and at right angles to, the kill zone and delivers enfilading fire that interlocks with fire from the other leg (Figure C-3). Figure C-3. L-formation: destruction ambush. C-9"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 b. This formation is flexible. It can be established on a straight stretch of a trail or stream or at a sharp bend in a trail or stream (Figure C-4). Figure C-4. L-formation: destruction ambush at bend of trail or stream. c. When appropriate, fire from the short leg can be shifted to parallel the long leg if the guerrilla force attempts to assault or escape in the opposite direction. In addition, the short leg prevents escape in that direction or reinforcement from that direction (Figure C-5). Figure C-5, L-formation: short leg prevents escape or reinforcement. C-17. Z-formation. The Z-shaped formation is another variation of the L-formation. The attack force is deployed as in the L-formation but with an additional side so that the formation resembles the letter Z. The additional side may serve to (Figure C-6): • Engage a force attempting to relieve or reinforce the guerrillas. • Restrict a flank. • Prevent envelopment (of the ambush force). • Seal the end of the kill zone. C-10"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 Figure C-6. Z-formation: destruction ambush. C-18. T-formation. a. b. c. In the T-shaped formation, the attack element is deployed across, and at right angles to, the route of movement of the hostile force so that the attack element and the target form the letter T. This formation can be used day or night to establish a purely harassing ambush, and at night to establish an ambush to interdict movement through open, hard-to-seal areas (such as rice paddies). A small unit can use the T-formation to harass, slow, and disorganize a larger force. When the lead guerrilla elements are engaged, they will normally attempt to maneuver right or left to close with the ambush force. Mines, mantraps, and other obstacles placed to the flanks of the kill zone slow the guerrilla’s movement and permit the unit to deliver heavy fire and then withdraw without becoming decisively engaged. (Figure C-7). The T-formation can be used to interdict small groups attempting night movement across open areas. For example, the attack element may be deployed along a rice paddy dike with every second member facing in the opposite direction. The attack of a force approaching from either direction requires only that every second member shift to the opposite side of the dike. Each member fires only to his front and only when the target is at close range. Attack is by fire only, and each member keeps the guerrilla force under fire as long as it remains to his front. If the force attempts to escape in either direction along the dike, each member takes it under fire as it comes into his vicinity. The T-formation is effective at halting infiltration. (Figure C-8). C-11"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 Figure C-7. T-formation: harassing ambush. d. It has one chief disadvantage: there is a possibility that while spread out the ambush will engage a superior force. Use of this formation must, therefore, fit the local enemy situation. Figure C-8. T-formation: rice paddy harassing ambush where guerrilla approach may be from either direction. C-12"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 C-19. V-formation. a. The V-shaped attack element is deployed along both sides of the guerrilla route of movement so that it forms a V. Care is taken to ensure that neither group (or leg) fires into the other. This formation subjects the guerrilla to both enfilading and -. interlocking fire (Figure C-9). Figure C-9. V-formation. b. The V-formation is suited for fairly open terrain but can also be used in the jungle. When established in the jungle, the legs of the V close in as the lead elements of the guerrilla force approach the apex of the V; elements then open fire from close range. Here, even more than in open terrain, all movement and fire is carefully coordinated and controlled to ensure that the fire of one leg does not endanger the other. Wider separation of the elements makes this formation difficult to control, and there are fewer sites that favor its use. Its main advantage is that it is difficult for the guerrilla to detect the ambush until well into the kill zone (Figure C-10). Figure C-10. V-formation (close range). C-13"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 C-20. Triangle formation. This is a variation of the V-formation and can be employed in three ways: a. Closed triangle. The attack element is deployed in three groups, positioned so that they form a triangle (or closed V). An automatic weapon is placed at each point of the triangle and positioned so that it can be shifted quickly to interlock with either of the others. Elements are positioned so that their fields of fire overlap. Mortars may be positioned inside the triangle. When deployed in this manner, the triangle ambush becomes a small unit strongpoint which is used to interdict night movement through open areas, when guerrilla approach is likely to be from any direction. The formation provides all-round security, and security elements are deployed only when they can be positioned so that, if detected by an approaching target, they will not compromise the ambush. Attack is by fire only, and the target is allowed to approach within close range before the ambush force opens fire (Figure C-11). (1) (2) Figure C-11. Closed triangle. Advantages include ease of control, all-round security, and guerrillas approaching from any direction can be fired on by at least two automatic weapons. Disadvantages include the requirement for an ambush force of platoon size or larger to reduce the danger of being overrun by a large guerrilla force; one or more legs of the triangle may come under guerrilla enfilade fire; and lack of dispersion, particularly at the points, increases danger from guerrilla mortar fire. C-14"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 b. Open triangle (harassing ambush). This variation of the triangle ambush is designed to enable a small unit to harass, slow, and inflict heavy casualties upon a larger force without being decisively engaged. The attack group is deployed in three elements, positioned so that each element becomes a corner of a triangle containing the kill zone. When the guerrillas enter the kill zone, the element to the guerrillas’ front opens fire on the lead guerrillas. When the guerrillas counterattack, the element withdraws and an assault element to the flank opens fire. When this group is attacked, the element to the opposite flank opens fire. This process is repeated until the guerrillas are pulled apart. Each element reoccupies its position, if possible, and continues to inflict maximum damage without becoming decisively engaged (Figure C-12). Figure C-12. Open triangle formation: harassing ambush. C-15"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 c. Open triangle (destruction ambush). The attack group is again deployed in three elements, positioned so that each element is a point of the triangle, 200 to 300 meters apart. The kill zone is the area within the triangle. The guerrillas are allowed to enter the killing zone; the nearest element attacks by fire. As the guerrillas attempt to maneuver or withdraw, the other elements open fire. One or more assault elements, as directed, assault or maneuver to envelop or destroy the guerrillas (Figure C-13). Figure C-13. Open triangle formation: destruction ambush. (1) As a destruction ambush, this formation is suitable for platoon-size or larger units; a unit smaller than a platoon would be in danger of being overrun. C-16"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 (2) C-21. Also, control, in assaulting or maneuvering, is difficult. Close coordination and control are necessary to ensure that assaulting or maneuvering assault elements are not fired on by another party; and the ambush site must be a fairly level, open area that provides (around its border) concealment for the ambush elements (unless it is a “rise from the ground” ambush). Box formation. a. This formation is similar in purpose to the open triangle ambush. The unit is deployed in four elements positioned so that each element becomes a corner of a square or rectangle containing the kill zone (Figure C-14). Figure C-14. Box formation: harassing ambush. b. It can be used as a harassing ambush or a destruction ambush in the same manner as the two variations of the open triangle ambush (Figure C-15).

A point ambush is established at a site having several trails or other escape routes leading away from it. The site may be a water hole, guerrilla campsite, or known rendezvous point, or a frequently traveled trail. This site is the central kill zone. C-23. Area ambush: multiple point a. Point ambushes are established along the trails or other escape routes leading away from the central kill zone (Figure C-16). C-18"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 Figure C-16. Area (multiple point) ambush. b. The guerrilla force, whether a single group or several parties approaching from different directions, is permitted to move to the central kill zone.

When the guerrillas break contact and attempt to disperse, escaping portions are intercepted and destroyed by the outlying ambushes. e. The multiple point ambush increases casualties and harassment and produces confusion. f. This version of the area ambush is best suited in terrain where movement is largely restricted to trails. It provides best results when established as a deliberate ambush. When there is not sufficient intelligence for a deliberate ambush, an area ambush of opportunity (hasty ambush) may be established. The outlying ambushes are permitted to attack guerrillas approaching the central kill zone, if the guerrilla force is small. If it is too large for the particular outlying ambush, the guerrillas are allowed to continue and they are attacked in the central kill zone. C-19"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 C-24. Area ambush: baited trap a. A variation of the area ambush is the “baited trap” ambush. b. A central kill zone is established along the guerrilla’s route of approach. c. Point ambushes are established along the routes over which units relieving or reinforcing the guerrilla will have to approach. d. The guerrilla force in the central kill zone serves as “bait” to lure relieving or reinforcing guerrilla units into the kill zones of the outlying ambushes. A friendly force can also be used as the “bait.” e. The outlying point ambushes need not be strong enough to destroy their targets. They may be small harassing ambushes that delay, disorganize, and cause casualties by successive contacts. f. This version can be varied by using a fixed installation as “bait” to lure relieving or reinforcing guerrilla units into the kill zone of one or more of the outlying ambushes. The installation replaces the central kill zone and is attacked. The attack may intend to overcome the installation or may use it as a ruse. g. These variations are best suited for situations where routes of approach for relieving or reinforcing guerrilla units are limited to those favorable for ambush (Figure C-17). Figure C-17.

This point ambush is designed for open areas that lack the cover and concealment and other features normally desirable in a “good” ambush site. The attack element is deployed in the formation best suited to the overall situation (Figure C-18). b. c. d. e. Figure C-18. Spider hole ambush. The attack element is concealed in the “spider hole” type of covered foxhole. Soil is carefully removed and positions expertly camouflaged. When the ambush is initiated, the attack element members throw back the covers and literally “rise from the ground” to attack. This ambush takes advantage of the tendency of patrols, and other units, to relax in areas that do not appear to favor ambush. The chief disadvantage is that the ambush element is vulnerable if detected prematurely. C-21 160-739 O - 94 - 6"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 C-26. Demolition ambush. a. Dual primed, electrically detonated mines or demolition charges are planted in an area over which a guerrilla force is expected to pass. This may be a portion of a road or trail, an open field, or any area that can be observed from a distance. Activating wires are run to a concealed observation point sufficiently distant to ensure safety of the ambush element. b. As large a force as desired or necessary can be used to mine the area. The ambush element remains to fire the charges; other personnel return to the unit. c. When a guerrilla force enters the mined area (kill zone), the element on site detonates the explosives and withdraws immediately to avoid detection and pursuit (Figure C-19). Figure C-19. Demolition ambush. C-27. Special ambush situation. Attacks against columns protected by armored vehicles depend on the type and location of armored vehicles in a column, and the weapons of the ambush force. If possible, armored vehicles are destroyed or disabled by fire of antitank weapons, landmines, and Molotov cocktails, or by throwing hand grenades into open hatches. An effort is made to immobilize armored vehicles at a point where they are unable to give protection to the rest of the convoy and where they will block the route of other supporting vehicles.

It describes various types of patrols and patrolling techniques. b. A patrol is a mission. The unit that has the mission organizes for the conduct of the patrol. When organizing for the patrol, unit integrity is maintained as much as possible. c. The requirements of the mission determine the size, organization, and equipment of a patrol. Some missions may require only two or three men, lightly armed with no special equipment; some missions may require a squad or platoon, specially armed and equipped. A unit is always tailored for the mission it is to execute. d. The effectiveness of a patrol is limited only by the ingenuity of the planner and the skill and aggressiveness of the unit leader. For this reason, they are one of the commander’s most valued tools. Patrols are especially valuable in counterguerrilla operations. Aggressive patrolling in an area greatly reduces the guerrillas’ freedom of movement, hampers their operations, and weakens their influence on the local population. e. Patrols are classified according to the nature of the mission assigned. D-2. Reconnaissance patrols. They collect information and confirm or disprove the accuracy of information previously received. Reconnaissance patrols are further classified as: Ž Zone reconnaissance patrols. Ž Area reconnaissance patrols. D-3. Combat patrols. They provide security and harass, destroy, or capture enemy personnel, equipment, and installations. Combat patrols also collect and report information whether it is related to the assigned mission or not. D-1"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 Section Il. Planning D-4. Five phases. There are five phases involved in mission planning: patrol steps, reverse planning sequence, the warning order, the time schedule, and the operation order.

In addition, items unchanged from the warning order are covered by stating \"same as warning order.\" D-5"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 D-6"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 Section Ill. Reconnaissance Patrols D-10. Information requirements. a. Reconnaissance patrols provide the commander with timely, accurate information of guerrillas and the terrain they control. This information is vital in making tactical decisions. b. The commander may require information of a specific location or small specific area, usually a known or suspected position or activity. An area reconnaissance patrol secures this information by reconnoitering the location or by maintaining surveillance over the location. c. The commander may require information of an extended area, or may desire information of several locations within an area. A zone reconnaissance patrol secures this information by recon- noitering the area, by maintaining surveillance over the area, or D-7"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 by making the coordinated area reconnaissance of designated locations within the area. D-11. Security. a. In addition to reaching the objective without discovery, if possible, a reconnaissance patrol also tries to conduct its reconnaissance or surveillance without being discovered. Stealth, patience, and maximum use of concealment are mandatory. b. A reconnaissance patrol fights only to protect itself or, when authorized, to accomplish its mission. The commander dispatching the patrol is responsible for informing tha patrol whether it is to fight, if necessary, to accomplish the mission. c. Day and night reconnaissance patrols use essentially the same techniques. The principal differences are: (1) Day reconnaissance requires greater use of concealment. The patrol is more likely to be seen than at night and usually will not be able to move as close to the objective. (2) Night reconnaissance requires stealth. Sounds carry farther at night, and reduced visibility usually requires a closer approach to the objective. d. When two or more teams of a patrol are to assembly at a linkup point, one team is designated to secure the linkup point for the arrival of other teams. The route and tasks of this team are arranged so that it can reach the linkup point first and accomplish these tasks. Section IV. Combat Patrols D-12. Seek and attack. a. A combat patrol has the general mission of seeking out and attacking targets of opportunity. An ambush is a combat patrol (Appendix C). b. In conventional operations, the enemy’s general location is usually defined. Specific targets for patrols are not difficult to locate and designate. Missions for patrols can be, and usually are, specific and limited. c. This situation seldom exists in counterguerrilla operations, however. Specific targets for raids and for other forms of attack are much more limited, because of the characteristics of guerrillas. They are elusive and highly mobile; they avoid decisive engagement; they avoid prepared positions and establish relatively few fixed installations. D-8"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 d. A combat patrol searches for and, within its capability, engages targets when and where found. Engagement is by raid, ambush, or any form of attack suitable to the situation. D-13. Flexibility. a. The combat patrol is one of the commander’s most flexible weapons. Uses vary from a two-man patrol executing a harassing ambush of opportunity to a reinforced platoon conducting raids, ambushes, and target-of-opportunity operations. In some instances, a patrol encountering a superior force may maintain contact with the force until reinforcements permit decisive engagement. Effectiveness of the patrol depends, not on size, but on the suitability to a given situation. b. The use of combat patrols forces guerrillas to engage in decisive combat at unfavorable times and places. They can be used to locate and destroy enemy camps, elements, and supply points. Saturation of an area with patrols forces the guerrillas to either curtail operations or consolidate in larger groups, which are favorable targets for air, artillery, and large-scale attack. c. Patrols may be inserted by parachute, helicopter, surface or subsurface watercraft, or ground methods. The conduct of the patrol itself remains unchanged, even though the method of insertion changes. Section V. Motorized Patrols D-14. Missions, organization. a. Patrols may be motorized (usually as an economy-of-force measure) to allow them to: (1) Cover greater distances in less time than dismounted patrols. (2) Operate in contaminated areas too dangerous for dismounted patrols. (3) Carry more or heavier equipment, weapons, and ammuni- tion. b. A motorized patrol is organized into elements and teams in the same manner as a dismounted patrol. Substitution of tracked carriers for wheeled vehicles provides an increased potential for battlefield mobility (Figure D-1). c. When soldiers are assigned to vehicles, squad or fire team integrity is maintained as far as possible. One soldier is designated commander of each vehicle. D-9"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 Figure D-1. Organization of a motorized reconnaissance patrol. d. A motorized patrol is prepared in the same general manner as a dismounted patrol. In addition, however, vehicles must be checked to ensure that they are in good mechanical condition and properly supplied with fuel, oil, and water. Drivers and other personnel are as thoroughly prepared for the mission as regular patrol members. e. Motorizing enables a patrol to carry heavy and bulky equipment such as: (1) Antitank weapons and ammunition are placed near the front and rear of the patrol. Personnel are designated to man and support these weapons when they are employed. (2) Surveillance equipment. (3) Additional automatic weapons and ammunition. f. Communication between vehicles and between the patrol and higher headquarters is essential. Within the patrol, radios, voice commands, and visual signals may be used. Vehicular-mounted radios are usually the best means for communication with higher headquarters. Light aircraft may be used to drop messages and to relay radio messages. D-15. Movement. A motorized patrol moves by one of three methods: continuous movement, successive bounds, and alternate bounds: D-10"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 a. In continuous movement, all vehicles travel at a moderate rate of speed, with all personnel alert. The lead vehicles stops to investigate only those areas that appear dangerous. This is the fastest, but least secure, method of movement. In successive bounds, vehicles keep their relative positions in the b. column. The first and second vehicles operate as a team in moving from one observation point to another. The second vehicle is placed in a concealed position, occupants dismounting if necessary, to cover movement of the first vehicle to an observation point. On reaching this point, occupants of the first vehicle observe and reconnoiter, dismounting if necessary. When the area is determined to be clear, the second vehicle is signaled forward to join the first vehicle. The commander of the first vehicle carefully observes the terrain to the front for signs of guerrillas and selects the next stopping point. The first vehicle then moves out and the process is repeated. Movement distance of the lead vehicle does not exceed the limit of observation or the range of effective fire support from the second vehicle. The lead vehicle and personnel are replaced frequently to ensure constant alertness. The other vehicles in the column move by bounds from one concealed position to the next. Each vehicle maintains visual contact with the vehicle ahead but avoids closing up (Figure D-2). Figure D-2. Lead vehicle moves by bounds. D-11"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 c. In alternate bounds, all except the first two vehicles keep their relative places in the column. The first two vehicles alternate as lead vehicles on each bound. Each covers the bound of the other. This method provides more rapid advance than movement by successive bounds but is less secure; it does not allow soldiers in the second vehicle enough time to thoroughly observe the terrain to the front before passing the first vehicle. Security is obtained by the vehicle commander who assigns each soldier a direction of observation: to the front, flank(s), or rear. This provides each vehicle with some security against surprise fire from every direction and provides visual contact with vehicles to the front and rear. For maximum observation, all canvas is removed from the vehicles. D-16. Actions at danger areas. a. b. c. d. e. The commander of the leading vehicle immediately notifies the unit leader when he encounters an obstacle or other danger area. Designated soldiers reconnoiter these places under cover of the weapons in the vehicle. Obstacles are bypassed, if possible. When they cannot be bypassed, they are cautiously removed. Side roads intersecting the route of advance are investigated. Soldiers from one vehicle secure the road junction; one or two vehicles investigate the side road. The amount of reconnaissance of side roads is determined by the patrol leader’s knowledge of the situation. Men investigating side roads do not, however, move past supporting distance of the main body of the patrol. Bridges, road junctions, defiles, and curves (that deny observation beyond the turn) are danger areas. Soldiers dismount and take advantage of available cover and concealment to investigate these areas. The vehicle is moved off the road into a covered or concealed position; weapons from the vehicle cover the advance of the investigating personnel (Figure D-3). When approaching a village, two or three soldiers may go forward on foot to reconnoiter. Other soldiers cover their movement from covered or concealed positions. Actions on contacting guerrillas depend on whether the mission permits or prohibits engaging in combat. For example, if the mission permits or requires the exploitation of opportunities for combat and the lead vehicle detects, or is attacked by, an ambush, then soldiers in the lead vehicle move to positions from which the guerrillas can be brought under fire. The soldiers dismount and maneuver to destroy the ambush. Higher headquarters is notified of the situation. D-12"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 Figure D-3. Soldiers dismount to investigate danger areas. f. In any situation where the soldiers dismount, drivers remain with and protect their vehicles. The vehicles are moved off the road, after ensuring that the shoulders of the road are not mined. If possible, they are positioned so that the drivers can support the attack. At least one automatic weapon remains with the vehicles. g. Higher headquarters is notified when the action is completed and the unit continues the mission.

This section describes basic and linear movements, and combat, zone, and area reconnaissance. D-18. Basic movements. a. In all cases, the unit moves from a start point (SP) to an objective rally point (ORP) and then on to its objective (OBJ) area (Figure D-4). Figure D-4. Basic movement sequence. b. The unit may then return to the ORP upon mission accomplishment, or it may proceed through the objective area and onto a linkup point (LUP) (Figure D-5).

Stream and trail. This technique of movement calls for the unit to use a trail or stream as a navigation guide.

Cross-compartment. The unit travels in a generally straight b. path regardless of terrain features (3). Reference Figure D-6. Figure D-6. Stream and trail (1), contour (2), and cross-compartment (3).

D-18"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 APPENDIX E Bases Section I. General E-1. Three types. This appendix explains the three types of bases generally used in a counterinsurgency: patrol bases, operational support bases, and support bases. E-2. Tactical uses. Patrol bases are used by a company or smaller units. Operational support bases are used by battalions, and support bases are used by brigades and larger units. Section Il. Patrol Bases E-3. Planning. a. When a unit halts for an extended period, it takes active and passive measures to provide maximum security. The leader selects, occupies, and organizes an area so located that it provides passive security from enemy detection. This is a patrol base. Planning a patrol base is usually a part of the patrol’s operation; or it may be an on-the-spot decision. The length of time a patrol base is occupied depends on the need for secrecy. In most situations, occupation should not exceed 24 hours except in an emergency. A patrol base is occupied the minimum time necessary to accomplish the mission. The same base is not (usually) used again. b. c. In counterguerrilla operations, patrol base secrecy is required; and evacuation (if discovered) depends on the degree of control the guerrilla force has in the base area, their ability to react to the discovery of a base, and their ability to affect the unit’s mission. When a guerrilla force is relatively small and weak, patrol base secrecy may not bean overriding consideration; and if the base is discovered, evacuation may not be required. In an area controlled by a large guerrilla force with a high degree of combat capability, patrol base secrecy is mandatory; and if discovered, evacuation is required. E-1"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 d. Typical situations that require planning for a patrol base include: (1) A requirement to cease all movement to avoid detection. (2) A requirement to hide the unit during a lengthy, detailed reconnaissance of the objective area. (3) A need to prepare food, maintain weapons and equipment, and rest after extended movement. (4) A need to formulate a final plan and issue orders for actions at the objective. (5) A requirement for reorganization after a patrol has infiltrated the enemy area in small groups (used in conjunction with a linkup point). (6) A need for a base from which to conduct several consecutive or concurrent operations such as ambush, raid, reconnaissance, or surveillance patrols. e. Any unforeseen situation occurring during a patrol mission could lead to an on-the-spot decision to establish a patrol base. E-4. Selection. a. The location for a patrol base is usually selected by map reconnaissance during planning. Selection may also be by aerial reconnaissance or based on prior knowledge of a suitable location. b. A patrol base established as the result of an on-the-spot decision requires reconnoitering, securing, expanding, and organizing the area occupied during a security halt. c. A patrol base location selected by map or aerial reconnaissance, or by prior knowledge of an area, is tentative. Its suitability is confirmed by ground reconnaissance, and it is secured before occupation. d. Plans to establish a patrol base include consideration of: (1) Alternate location. This is used if the initial location proves unsuitable or if the unit is required to evacuate the initial location prematurely. In counterguerrilla operations, reconnaissance and surveillance of an alternate location, until occupied or no longer needed, are desirable. (2) Linkup point. This is used if the unit evacuates the patrol base by exfiltration in groups. The linkup point does not have to be reconnoitered. (3) Rallying point. This is used if the unit is dispersed from the patrol base. It is a point over which the unit has previously passed, and it is known to all. E-2"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 E-5. Considerations. a. When planning for a patrol base, passive and active security measures are considered, as well as the mission. b. With regard to passive security measures, base selection includes: (1) Difficult terrain that impedes foot movement and has little tactical value. (2) An area with dense vegetation (bushes and trees that spread out close to the ground). (a) An area remote from human habitation. (b) An area near a water source. (c) An area that avoids known or suspected enemy positions; built-up areas; ridgelines and topographic crests (except as necessary for maintaining adequate communications); roads or trails and natural lines of drift; and wet areas, steep slopes, and small valleys that may be lines of drift. c. With regard to active security measures, base selection in- cludes: (1) Outpost and listening post systems covering avenues of approach into the area. (2) Communications with outposts and listening posts. (3) Defense of the patrol base (if required). (4) Withdrawal, to include multiple withdrawal routes (if required). (5) An alert plan. (6) Enforcement of camouflage, noise, and light discipline. (7) Conduct of necessary activities with minimum movement and noise. E-6. Occupation and operation of a patrol base. a. A patrol base maybe occupied in two ways: (1) By moving to a selected site and organizing the area in the same manner as an on-the-spot establishment. (2) By halting near the selected site and sending forward reconnaissance forces. E-3"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 b. The method is thoroughly planned and rehearsed. The use of patrol base drills (in either method) assists in the swift and efficient establishment of patrol bases. (1) Approach. The unit is halted at a suitable position within 200 meters of the tentative patrol base location. Close-in security is established. Previously designated individuals (preferably leaders of the unit’s major subunits) join the unit leader (Figure E-1). Figure E-1 Approach and reconnaissance. (2) Reconnaissance. The leader designates a point of entry into the patrol base location as 6 o’clock, assigns areas by the clock system, designates the center of the base as headquarters, and moves there. Subordinate leaders then reconnoiter assigned areas for suitability and return to the unit leader. Usually, two men are dispatched to bring the unit forward. (3) Occupation. The unit leaves its line of march at right angles and enters the base in single file, moving to the center of the base. Designated men remove signs of the unit’s movement. Each leader peels off his unit and leads it to the left flank of the unit sector. Each unit occupies its portion of the perimeter by moving clockwise to the left flank of the next sector. The unit leader checks the perimeter by meeting each leader at the left flank of his sector, moving clockwise (Figure E-2). E-4"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"Figure E-2. Occupation, initial phase. (a) Each leader reconnoiters forward of his sector by moving a designated distance out from the left flank of the sector, moving clockwise to the right limit of the sector, and reentering at the right flank of the sector. He reports indications of the enemy or civilians, suitable observation and listening post positions, rallying points, and withdrawal routes (Figure E-3).

(b) The unit leader designates rallying points, positions for OPs and listening posts, and withdrawal routes. Each unit puts out one two-man observation post (OP) (day), and one three-man listening post (LP) (night), and establishes communications (Figure E-4). Figure E-4. Typical patrol base layout. E-6"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 (4) Operation security. Only one point of base entry and exit is used. It is camouflaged and guarded at all times. Fires are built only when necessary and, as a rule, only in daylight. Whether day or night, only necessary fires are built, and they are kept as small as possible. Where terrain permits, fires are built in pits and, if built at night, are carefully covered and shielded. Building fires in pits reduces the danger of visual detection and facilitates extinguishing the fires and camouflaging the sites. The driest and hardest wood available is used (to reduce smoke). In most areas, the best time for building fires is when the air is thin and smoke dissipates quickly (usually around noon); early morning may be appropriate, however, in areas where there is ground fog. The risk of detection, because of lingering odor, must be weighed against the risk of detection due to visible smoke. (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) Noisy tasks, such as cutting branches, are accom- plished at designated times, as early as possible after occupation but never at night nor during the quiet periods of early morning and late evening. When possible, noisy tasks are performed when other sounds will cover them, such as the sounds of aircraft, artillery, or distant battle noises. Movement, both inside and outside the patrol base, is restricted to the minimum. Civilians who discover the location of the patrol base are detained until the base is moved or until they can be evacuated to higher headquarters. Care is taken to prevent detained civilians from learning about base operation and future plans. If necessary, they are tied and blindfolded and their ears are covered. When sufficient personnel are available, OPs are manned by at least two men so they can alternate and ensure alertness at all times. This also removes the need for traffic between the OP and the patrol base. Listening posts are manned by at least two, preferably three, individuals so they can alternate and remain alert. A 1-hour stand-to is observed morning and evening: 30 minutes before and 30 minutes after light in the morning, and 30 minutes before and 30 minutes after dark in the evening. This ensures that every man is acclimated to changing light conditions, and is dressed, equipped, and ready for action. E-7"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 (f) Each man knows the locations of men and positions to his flanks, front, and rear, and knows the times and routes of any expected movement within, into, and out of the patrol base. (5) Defense. Defensive measures are planned, but a patrol base is usually defended only when evacuation is not possible. Elaborate firing positions are not constructed; nonetheless, camouflage and concealment are stressed. (a) Artillery and mortar fires may be planned, if available. Early warning devices may be placed on avenues of approach. If the base is to be defended, then mines and trip flares may be placed on avenues of approach and in areas that cannot be covered by fire. The value of these devices is weighed against the fact that their discovery automatically com- promises the patrol base. (b) An alert plan includes evacuation and defense. All members know the plans and the signals or orders for their implementation. Plans cover pursuit and destruction of the attacking force. (6) Communications. Communications are established with higher headquarters, subordinate units, OPs, and listening posts. The system provides for every man to be alerted quickly and quietly. Radios, an excellent means of communication, are carefully controlled. Wire can be used within the patrol base if its bulk and weight, and the time required to lay and pick up, are not disadvantages. Tug, or pull, wires may be used for signaling. They are quiet and reduce radio or telephone traffic. Messengers maybe used within the patrol base. (7) Maintenance. Weapons and equipment are cleaned and maintained as required. (8) Sanitation and personal hygiene. In daylight, catholes outside the perimeter are used. The user is guarded. At night, catholes are used inside the perimeter. Men wash, shave, and brush their teeth as needed, consistent with the situation (including availability of water). Cans, food, and other trash are taken with the departing patrol for security. (9) Messing. Men eat at staggered times, as planned and controlled. Preparation of meals is planned (if required). (10) Water. Guarded water parties provide water. Lone individuals do not visit the water source. No more than E-8"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 two visits to the source are made in a 24-hour period. Use of water is controlled (as required). (11) Rest. Rest and sleep are permitted after all work is done. Rest periods are staggered to maintain security. Consistent with work and security requirements, as much sleep and rest as possible are scheduled for each man. (12) Resupply. If the unit is to be resupplied by air, the flight path, drop zone or landing zone, and cache are located so that neither the base nor possible objectives are compromised. (13) Planning and conduct of operations. Details of operations are passed to all unit members. Members are not assembled atone time as this would endanger base security. Rehearsals are limited to terrain models, with part of the unit rehearsing while the remainder provides security. Weapons are not test fired. If part of the unit is absent on an operation, the perimeter is adjusted, if necessary, to ensure security. Orders are as brief as possible. Maximum practical use is made of fragmentary orders and references to SOPs. (14) Departure. All signs of the unit’s presence are removed or concealed. This may prevent the enemy from learning that the unit is in the area, prevent pursuit, or prevent the enemy from learning how the patrol base is operated. Night evacuation (in case of attack) is avoided if possible. Evacuation is conducted as a unit when possible. Section Ill. Battalion Operational Support Bases E-7. Purpose. When engaged in counterguerrilla operations, battalion elements often establish a base for command and control and fire support resources, protected by a perimeter defense. These resources are called the battalion operational support base. E-8. Perimeter defense. a. The OSB perimeter defense location depends upon: (1) Forces available to defend the combat base. (2) Ability to support subordinate units with indirect fire. (3) Defensibility of terrain. (4) Ability to communicate with subordinate units. E-9"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 b. Before establishing the battalion OSB, the commander reconnoiters to determine terrain defensibility. He also plans the defense force. c. While the defense is designed to defeat the heaviest attack the enemy is likely to conduct, it uses minimal forces. Essential elements (reinforced as necessary) of the headquarters and headquarters company (HHC) compose the force available to prepare and defend the perimeter. E-9. OSB commander. a. The battalion commander normally designates the HHC commander as battalion OSB commander in charge of perimeter defense. Forces normally under control of the OSB commander include: (1) An antitank platoon. (2) An air defense section, if attached (to man the perimeter and provide antiaircraft fire). (3) A heavy mortar platoon (to man the perimeter and provide fire support). (4) A rifle platoon (if provided for perimeter defense or as a reaction force). b. The scout platoon is normally used for patrolling or screening missions, rather than perimeter defense. Use of specialty unit personnel (air defense and mortar) for manning the perimeter will reduce the responsiveness of those systems. An element of risk is involved. c. During defense works construction, the perimeter is vulnerable to attack, so it is completed as quickly as possible. Maximum security is provided during construction. E-10. Infiltration. a. Guerrillas may be able to conduct large-scale attacks on fortified positions, but they may disrupt operations by infiltrating one or two men through the perimeter to place explosive devices on command and control facilities, artillery pieces or mortars, or ammunition storage areas. b. This infiltration often follows a deceptive attack or probe. The perimeter defense force maintains constant security, using early warning systems and continuous patrolling. Starlight scopes, OPs, unattended ground sensors, ground surveillance radars, and trip flares are also used. Wire obstacles should be used to keep infiltrators out of critical facilities. E-10"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 c. A battalion OSB may have to remain in place for an extended period, but it is not a permanent base. Continuous firing of mortars and landing of helicopters make concealing its location difficult. These factors require that the perimeter defense be hardened. Overhead cover and sandbagged bunkers are provided for all fighting positions. The tactical operations center and command post (CP) require similar protection (or they maybe dug underground). Mortars and artillery pieces are dug in or fortified with sandbags. E-11. Reserves. a. A reserve for the defense is made up from attachments (engineers, if available, or from off-shift personnel from tactical operation center [TOC] and CP elements). The reserve reacts to enemy attacks and reinforces the defense or counterattack. It is rehearsed on signals and actions. Mortars are employed to provide close-in fire support. Artillery pieces maybe able to provide direct fire but may not be able to provide indirect fire in support of the perimeter. Hence, the perimeter should be within range of other artillery and mortar units for additional protection. E-12. Work priorities. a. A priority of work is scheduled to construct the battalion OSB. The priority placed on actions is dependent upon the tactical situation and the availability of resources. Work is accomplished in the following sequence, consistent with the tactical situation and the availability of resources. b. (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) Step 1. Air assault and/or ground assault seizes the site; immediate security is established to include OPs; area is swept for booby traps; and mortars are laid. Step 2. Communications are established; CP is set up; TOC position is dug in; and selected TOC personnel are displaced to perimeter defense. Step 3. Perimeter positions are established; fields of fire are cleared; reserve force is established; and wire is laid to all positions. Step 4. Barriers and obstacles are placed around perimeter defense; early warning devices are emplaced; security and ambush patrol plans are established; and final protective fire (FPF) is called in. Step 5. Positions are sustained; positions are hardened with overhead cover; all other positions are improved; more E-11"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 fields of fire are cleared; the landing zone is enlarged; and the latrine, generators, and ammunition supply point are estab- lished. NOTE: Camouflage is applied throughout base preparations. b. The size of the base is dependent upon the situation and the terrain available. When artillery is within the perimeter, then the OSB is larger to accommodate the guns and supporting equipment (Figure E-5). Figure E-5. Example of OSB. Section IV. Brigade, Division Support Base E-13. Permanent-type base. a. A brigade or division support base is larger and more permanent. It is usually near an airfield and/or generally in consolidation E-12"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 b. areas. This section describes the responsibilities and organization found in the defense of more permanent installations. An area command is composed of those organized elements of one or more of the armed services designated to operate in a specific geographical area; these armed services are placed under a single commander. The area command may range in size from an area (theater) of operations to a small urban complex. The purpose of such area assignment is to: (1) Secure unity of effort in such operational missions as may be assigned to commanders. (2) Coordinate defense, logistics, and the use of available facilities. c. To provide for the effective defense of a base within his command or for joint planning within his area of responsibility, the commander must: (1) Assign the responsibility for defense of the base and surrounding local defense areas. (2) Establish the method of command or coordination to be exercised. (3) Ensure the establishment of appropriate command relation- ships between subordinate area and base commanders. d. Command relationships, security, and defense responsibilities vary at the base command level because of the possible multinational and multiservice force combinations involved in the overall defense effort of a given base. In most cases, base ownership, national-level agreements, and mutual agreements among senior commanders determine relationships and responsibilities. The relationship between US service components and host country forces is included in the directive of the US establishing authority. This relationship is generally one of mutual coordination and cooperation. Relationships among US service components using the same base are also outlined in the directive of the establishing authority. These relationships follow the principles designated for joint operations, attachment, or support given in JCS Publication 2. E-14. Organization of forces. The overall organization for base defense includes three basic elements: permanent, as required, and as available. E-13 160-739 O - 94 - 7"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 a. Permanent. Permanently assigned elements for base defense and/or security responsibilities are: (1) Provisional-type base defense forces which have been assigned a primary mission to defend the base. This force includes personnel and equipment for command and control; conduct of patrols; manning of outposts, listening posts, and the base perimeter; and reserve and/or reaction force activities. (2) Component police and security elements make up the internal security force. Although not normally a part of the BDF, these forces perform their routine security duties in close coordination with the defense force commander to ensure complete protection and integration of defensive planning. (3) Combat support and combat service support units are relatively static support units, such as communications and maintenance elements, which exercise their support capabil- ities from within the perimeter of the base. As required. Elements assigned base defense responsibilities on an “as required” basis include units, or elements of units, normally occupying or operating in the base area whose primary mission is not base defense. These elements, referred to as the emergency augmentation force, supplement the capabilities of the BDF when the degree of threat or intensity of guerrilla attack dictates that they cease their primary functions and assist in base defense. The emergency augmentation force may consists of US, host country, or allied ground, naval, or air forces. b. c. As available. Elements assigned base defense responsibilities on an “as available” basis include: (1) Transient units of US, host country, or allied military forces temporarily in the base area. (2) Tenant units on the base between operations. (3) Host units or units of other nation(s) normally in areas adjacent to the base perimeter that have been designated, by their commanders, to provide assistance to the base when their own operations do not require total effort. E-15. Operational concepts. a. Base defense includes all actions that units occupying the base must take to protect themselves from enemy acts. Such actions E-14"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 inevitably interfere to some degree with the primary mission of some of the elements involved. To reduce this interference, the following principles apply: (1) (2) (3) (4) Tenant units not assigned primarily for base defense are normally used in the role or configuration for which they are organized and trained — except when required for duty as emergency augmentation forces during an all-out attack on the base. Combat, combat support, and combat service support elements are specifically allocated for base defense missions when guerrilla actions are frequent, prolonged, or severe. When emergency augmentation forces are used in base defense situations, they must be returned to their primary functions as soon as the situation permits. Base tenant unit personnel are responsible for local security. b. The organization of a provisional defense force or the assignment of a combat unit to provide security for the base does not relieve them of this responsibility. The overall concept of base defense includes all actions required to preseve the operating integrity of the base. c. Regardless of the military measures applied, there is no defense that prevents guerrillas from attacking and damaging a base if they are willing to pay the price in manpower and materiel. Making them pay a high price holds down the number of attacks. d. Defense of the critical areas is a primary consideration. The critical areas are facilities and installations whose continued operation is essential for the accomplishment of the primary mission. These facilities and installations are designated by the base commander or higher authority and include power stations; petroleum, oils, and lubricants storage sites; ammunition storage sites; aircraft facilities; and artillery emplacements. e. Defense of a military base involves a combination of area denial actions, aggressive offensive operations, and immediate reaction to guerrilla threat or attack. While hardening of facilities and maintaining an immediate reaction force are the responsibility of the base commander, area denial actions and major offensive operations are the responsibility of the area commander. Use of barriers, field expedient flame weapons, natural obstacles, and aggressive offensive actions deny guerrillas access to the area immediately surrounding the base. If they are kept at a distance, they cannot launch damaging rocket attacks on the base. If they E-15"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 penetrate far enough to use rockets or other long-range weapons, hardening and dispersal of base resources may reduce the damage. Plans are prepared to counter the threat or attack, and reaction forces are kept ready to immediately implement these plans. This preparation includes plans by area commanders to commit other forces to base defense. Base defense plans are coordinated with host country officials and other allied forces through use of the area coordination center. f. g. Responsive, rapid fire support is required for base defense operations. Artillery and mortar fire can provide quick reaction to the infiltration and standoff attack threats. If in range, naval gunfire is used the same as artillery fire. In base defense operations, base-positioned fire support units follow normal fire support procedures. Fire support units positioned outside the base area, but within support range, are included in the overall base defense fire support plan. Also included are the fire support capabilities of host country and other allied forces. h. The fire support coordination center is operational 24 hours a day. It must have immediate access to host country officials who can autho rize fire within areas not predesignated as free fire zones. E-16. Base commander. a. The mission of the base commander is to exercise command, control, and administration of the base and also to exercise necessary control of resident and transient units not a part of the base command. b. A base commander may also be the area commander. At the same time, he may also be the component Army, Navy, Marine Corps, or Air Force commander; or he may be designated separately. c. The base commander’s responsibilities include establishing the overall defense organization as well as planning, preparing, and executing all defense measures. If the base mounts or supports operations of two or more services that occupy and operate separate nonadjoining facilities within the base area, the base commander, as base defense coordinating authority, plans and directs the employment of these forces in base defense roles. The base commander normally appoints a base defense force commander to assist him in executing base defense functions (Figure E-6). E-16"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 Figure E-6. Organization of base defense. E-17. Base defense force commander. a. b. The base defense force commanders normally appointed to supervise the preparation of detailed defense plans to include establishing defense sectors, conducting required training, providing for or coordinating logistical support, and controlling base defense operations. As the base commander’s special representative, the BDF commander coordinates the planning efforts of all elements scheduled to participate in the base defense. During the defense, he exercises command authority over these elements. Commanders of base elements maybe given responsibility for the defense training of their forces or for making their forces available to the BDF commander for training. Additional requirements such as procurement and storage of essential supplies, construction of defense installations, medical support, and communications assistance may also be levied against these commanders, consistent with overall requirements. E-17"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 E-18. Base defense force. a. The mission of the BDF, whether it be an assigned or a provisional force, is to prevent or resist an enemy attack by destroy in the enemy force, reducing the enemy capacity for offensive action, and denying the enemy entry into the base area. Detecting and destroying enemy forces (organized in strength) are responsibilities of the area commander; however, the BDF commander may initiate offensive action in areas over which he has operational control. b. The accomplishment of this basic mission requires thorough planning for an aggressive defense fully supported by other forces of the area command. E-19. Major tenant units. a. All units assigned to the base constitute elements of the overall defense force of the base. During an enemy attack or threat, some elements maybe required to continue their primary function longer than others. In this respect, all local unit defenses are coordinated by the BDF commander to ensure that each contributes to the overall defense of the base as well as to the local security of the areas in which the unit is quartered or employed. b. Since all tenant units may not be organized and equipped for base defense tasks, they must be provided with appropriate weapons, ammunition, and equipment, as well as combat and logistical support. E-20. Transient units. Transient units, or other units not a part of the base command, maybe placed under operational control of the base commander, or the BDF commander, for emergency defense. Transient units may be elements of US components, host country, or other allied military forces. E-21. Employment of forces. Forces whose primary mission is base defense patrol aggressively, develop and occupy defensive positions within their assigned sectors, and prepare immediate reaction forces to counter any guerrilla action. These forces may be uniservice, joint, or combined, depending on the composition of base area forces. E-22. Defensive construction. a. Shelters. Construction of personnel shelters throughout the billeting, administrative, and maintenance areas provides E-18"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 b. c. d. individual protection against standoff attacks. Depending on resources available, these shelters vary in construction. Shipping containers, dugouts, and double-walled plywood shelters with sand or gravel fill, all with sandbag reinforcement and overhead cover, provide acceptable protection. These shelters are close to the billets and work areas to permit rapid access. Bunkers. Fighting bunkers may be constructed on position or prefabricated and moved to position for assembly. These bunkers should be strong enough to withstand direct hit by recoilless rifle fire on the front and sides and a direct hit by a mortar round on the top. Revetments. Construction of revetments for critical resources provides additional protection against mortar and rocket fragmentation. These revetments may be of sand-filled, double- walled construction, with either plywood or steel plate sides. Overhead cover is provided when possible. Wire. Tactical wire barriers should be used within the perimeter to limit and canalize penetrations by enemy groups or individuals. Initially, these barriers can be as simple as a single strand of wire 3 to 4 feet high. Generally, they should be placed to prevent a direct approach to vital installations, and they should be covered by automatic weapons fire. The barriers are constructed as inconspicuously as possible and relocated periodically to disrupt enemy plans. Further, the barriers must not preclude freedom of movement by the reaction or reserve forces. These forces, and other personnel, become thoroughly familiar with the location of all barriers during the course of daylight and night drills. E-23. Defense positions. a. The key base defense positions consist primarily of bunkers and towers in the base perimeter area. The positioning of bunkers and towers affords maximum observation and mutually supporting fires over the area forward of the perimeter to include the perimeter barrier and sensor system. (1) Bunkers. Full-time observation and all-round defense of the base are essential. To reduce the number of personnel conducting static defense missions, however, it may be possible to designate key bunkers around the perimeter to be manned at all times and the remainder to be fully manned during darkness, reduced visibility, and increased enemy threat. Individual fighting positions are prepared near the bunkers to provide covering fires. Night and day vision devices, automatic weapons, grenade launchers, and hand grenades are common to the positions. Antitank weapons cover possible vehicle approaches. E-1 9"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 (2) Towers. When coupled with night and day vision aids, sensors, and flash-ranging devices, elevated platforms enhance the capability of detecting perimeter infiltration and the location of guerrilla mortar and/or rocket firing positions. Either standard military towers or towers constructed from local materials can be used. The installation of sandbags or steel plating around observation platforms provides protection against automatic weapons and small arms fire. Construction of a ground-level bunker provides additional protection when fires are directed against the tower. Access to the bunker maybe by means of a fireman’s pole or a ladder arrangement. Tower safety measures for consideration include: (a) Lightning arresters. (b) Construction to withstand strong winds and to support two observers and their equipment. (c) Enclosed mounting ladder. (d) Provision of safety nets round the tower when warranted by tower height. (e) Painting it a dark color to reduce reflection from moon- light. (f) Installation of a suitable roof to shield personnel from the elements without interference to observation. A double-roof design could cause mortar rounds to detonate at a height that affords some protection to observers. b. Control is the key to a successful base defense. To achieve the necessary control, a communication capability must be established between the base defense operations center and commanders of sectors of responsibility, and between the sector commander and his bunkers, towers, and reserve. Additionally, bunkers within each section can communicate laterally within the sector, and flank bunkers of one sector can communicate with flank bunkers of adjacent sectors. E-24. Training considerations. a. Individual and collective training. Most of the training required in support of base defense operations is currently a part of individual and collective training programs. Individuals designated to take any part in base defense operations will probably require additional training in areas applicable to their roles in the base defense effort. Training may be on: E-20"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) Techniques of ambushes and raids and defensive measures against these types of operations. Use of hearing, sight, and smell as detection means. Police-type patrolling and the operation of roadblocks and checkpoints. Night operations to include use of night observation devices and sensors and special challenge, sign, and countersign techniques. Individual and crew-served weapons cross-training within the unit. Marksmanship, especially night firing. Observation post operations with emphasis on security, sound and light discipline, and reporting procedures. Operation and operator maintenance of special devices such as radars, sensors, and night observation devices (if employed). Familiarization with all communications equipment available within the unit and communication techniques. Barrier construction, mines, and booby traps. Patrolling of all types. Counterattack. Fire control. b. Area orientation. All individuals require an orientation on the guerrilla and his tactics, local customs, social values, and the civilian population in the area. The capabilities and procedures of civil police and indigenous forces are explained, since elements of the base and base defense force may operate in conjunction with them. Status-of-forces agreements and rules of engagement concerning use of weapons must be covered. c. Technical training. The most up-to-date surveillance, target acquisition, and night observation (STANO) equipment should be used in base defense operations. Its installation and operation require special training. If enough specialists are not available, the scope of training is expanded. Additional maintenance specialists are also required to keep equipment operational and to advise and assist operators on their maintenance responsibilities. Maintenance and operator training is scheduled periodically to ensure a current capability to use the equipment. d. Morale and psychological factors. The morale and psycho- logical pressures on troops employed in base defense operations differ from those normally found in regular combat operations. Many of these pressures are caused by infrequent contact with E-21 160-739 O - 94 - 8"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 guerrillas and the requirement for constant vigilance. Other factors include: (1) Boredom caused by recurring routine tasks, which tends to lead to laxity. (2) The tendency to become inattentive, which occurs because little physical activity is required in operating or monitoring observation devices or sensor equipment. (3) The disruption of normal sleep and eating routines, which occurs when operations continue day and night. (4) Long periods of relative inactivity, which may result if training is not pursued vigorously. e. Leader participation. Leaders at all echelons must carry out a continuing indoctrination and motivation program to offset psychological pressures. This is an important part of the training program. Physical training and athletic and recreation programs are essential to maintaining high morale. E-25. Defense exercises. a. Defense exercises provide a means for rehearsing the BDF defense plans, to include testing of the base defense alarm and communication systems, and for training and diverse elements of the defense force to act in a coordinated effort. b. Defense exercises are the final and most important step in the training cycle. These exercises familiarize all elements of the defense force, and the base tenant units, with their assignments in base defense. The exercises are conducted frequently, under various weather conditions, and during both daylight and dark- ness. c. Exercises include, but are not limited to: (1) Defense of sectors of responsibility to include rehearsing counterattacks and manning defense positions. (2) Employment of the reserve for counterattacking and for reinforcing the defense positions. (3) Coordination of supporting fires and other means of support. (4) Integration of the emergency augmentation force with other units of the defense force. (5) Coordination with other forces of the base, such as the air defense units that may be used in a ground defense role. d. Command post exercises should be held frequently to: (1) Train the staffs of all headquarters involved in base defense. E-22"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 (2) Train fire support coordination agencies. (3) Test communications. (4) Obtain the necessary coordination and liaison between the base defense headquarters and the headquarters of base tenant forces. E-23"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 APPENDIX F Smoke, Flame, Herbicides, and Riot Control Agents F-1. Employment. a. This appendix provides guidance on the employment of chemical agents and munitions in counterguerrilla operations. b. The munitions are useful where there is difficulty in pinpointing guerrilla locations, and where the area coverage provided by riot control munitions would be greater than that of other available weapon systems. F-2. Smoke. a. b. c. Smoke may be used to identify, signal, obscure, deceive, and screen. It may be used to identify and signal targets, supply and evacuation point, and friendly unit positions. It may also provide the counterguerrilla commander with prearranged battlefield communications. Obscuring smoke is used on guerrilla positions to reduce their ability to see and engage friendly targets. Deceptive smoke is used to mislead guerrillas as to friendly force intentions. Screening smoke is used in friendly operational areas, or between friendly and guerrilla forces to deny guerrilla observation of areas where friendly units are maneuvering, or resupply or recovery operations are in progress. This type of smoke employment usually is not required by the counterguerrilla commander until the later stages of Phases II and III. Smoke sources include: (1) Mechanical smoke generators (large screen areas). (2) Smoke grenades (small screens, signaling, identifying). (3) M110-pound smoke pot (small screen). (4) ABC-M5 30-pound smoke pot (small screen). (5) M42A and M207A1 floating smoke pot (small screens, ground or water base). (6) WP mortar and WP and HC artillery rounds (obscuring, signaling, deceiving, identifying). (7) WP tank rounds, 90-mm and 105-mm (small screens, obscuring, signaling, identifying). (8) Grenade-launched round by tanks, Bradley fighting vehicle, and M203 (small, individual screens). F-1"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 (9) Vehicle engine exhaust smoke systems, tanks, and Bradley fighting vehicle (small, individual screens). (10) Aircraft-delivered smoke ordnance (large screens). d. Depending on the weather and terrain, smoke screening may not always be effective. For example, the wind could be too strong or be blowing from the wrong direction. Signaling, identifying, and obscuring are all good smoke missions in all phases of a counterguerrilla operation. F-3. Flame expedients and the M202. a. Flaming fuel and hot shrapnel, exploding over an area up to 100 meters in diameter, is an effective defensive weapon. If a target is to be pinpointed, then the M202 rocket can be used to flame a hostile position. b. The flame mine is an omnidirectional expedient that can be command detonated or activated by a tripwire. It will scatter flame and shrapnel over an area 20 to 80 meters in diameter, depending on the size of the mine. c. The fougasse (flame/shrapnel) expedient is similar to the mine except that its explosive force is directional (rather than all-round). A 55-gallon barrel is often used as a container for fuel and shrapnel. The barrel is placed in a V-trench, sandbagged in place, and an explosive charge is placed behind the barrel. When exploded, the flaming fuel and pieces of metal are blown out to a distance of 100 meters or more (in a broad V-pattern). d. The M202 rocket launcher contains four rockets that burst into flame on impact. The aiming device on the launcher provides on-target accuracy for close-in combat. F-4. Herbicides. a. The United States renounces first use of herbicides in war except use, under regulations applicable to their domestic use and the rules of engagement, for control of vegetation within US bases and installations or around their immediate defensive perimeters to clear observation and fields of fire. b. Herbicides have the potential to destroy food production and defoliate large areas. The US will not use herbicides in this way, unless they are first used against US forces and the President directs their use in retaliation. F-5. Riot control agents. a. The United States renounces the first use of riot control agents (RCA) in war, except defensively to save lives. The use of RCA is F-2"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 not governed by the same policy as chemical agents. Since they are not used to injure or kill and their effects are short lived, there are times when the use of RCA is more appropriate than conventional weapons. b. Commonly used not control agents contain chemicals that cause vomiting, sneezing, and watering (tears) of the eyes. c. RCA containers include hand grenades and 40-mm cartridge grenades (M203 launcher). When used, the grenades, whether thrown or fired, are directed upwind of the target so the chemical particulate (vapor) will drift onto the hostile position. d. RCAs are used to force guerrillas from tunnels, caves, and buildings in an effort to take them prisoner. When counterguerrilla units probe possible ambush sites, RCAs may be employed to flush guerrillas and take prisoners. e. When counterguerrilla units are in defensive positions, canister of RCA (containing the agent in powder form) maybe detonated by remote control. This type of agent causes reactions similar to RCA vapor agents and blisters the skin. f. Counterguerrilla personnel will wear the protective mask and cover exposed skin areas when employing RCAs. Decontamination, after RCA missions, requires troops to wash skin areas and brush or wash clothing. F-3"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 APPENDIX G Operations and Techniques Section I. General G-1. Tactical variations. a. Chapter 3 presents an overview of the most common types of tactical counterguerrilla operations conducted in an insurgency. This appendix presents techniques that may be employed when conducting those operations. b. Chart G-1 presents some of the most common operations and techniques that a counterguerrilla force employs. Generally, large-scale operations are more suited to the later stages of an insurgency while small unit tactics are more suited to the whole spectrum (see page G-2). G-2. Standard operations. With minor adaptations (Chapter 3), some operations discussed in FM 7-10 and FM 7-20 can be used for counterguerrilla warfare. These operations include raids, movements to contact, hasty attacks, deliberate attacks, reconnaissance in force, exploitations, and pursuits. Section Il. Operations. G-3. Encirclement. a. Encirclement is designed to cut off all ground routes for escape and reinforcement of the encircled guerrilla force. It offers the best possibility for fixing guerrilla forces in position and achieving decisive results. Battalion and larger units may conduct en- circlements. b. The company and smaller units normally lack enough men and command and control capability to conduct encirclements (except against small, concentrated guerrilla forces). All units of the brigade may participate in encirclements conducted by a larger force. c. Planning, preparation, and execution are aimed at complete encirclement of the guerrilla force. Maximum security and surprise can be gained by completing the encirclement during darkness. d. Encircling movements are executed rapidly. Use of air assault and airborne troops can contribute speed and surprise to the early G-1"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 Chart G-1. Comparison of operations. phases of an encirclement. Positions are occupied simultaneously in order to block escape. If simultaneous occupation is not possible, escape routes most likely to be used are covered first. G-2"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 Initial occupation is the most critical period of an encirclement. If large guerrilla formations realize that they are being encircled, they can be expected to react immediately to probe for gaps or attack weak points to force a gap. e. Units occupying the encircling positions provide strong combat patrols well to their front to give early warning of attempted breakouts and to block escape routes. Mobile reserves are positioned for immediate movement to counter any threat of a breakout, and to reinforce difficult areas such as deep ravines or areas containing cave or tunnel complexes. f. Indirect fire support can cloak an impending encirclement by gaining and maintaining the guerrilla’s attention while encircling units move into position. Fires, including field artillery, should be planned in detail to support the encirclement after it is discovered. G-4. Contraction. a. Following the initial encirclement, the capture or destruction of the guerrilla force is methodical and thorough. Fire and maneuver are used in a simultaneous, controlled contraction of the en- circlement. b. As the line of encirclement is contracted, and depending on terrain, units may be removed from the line and added to the reserve. Against small guerrilla forces, the entire encircled area may be cleared by contraction; however, against larger guerrilla forces, it is probable that, at some point, some action other than further contraction will be required (Figure G-l). Figure G-1. Contraction technique. G-3"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 c. One technique, employed after some degree of contraction, is to employ a blocking force on one or more sides of the perimeter while part of the encirclement forces the guerrillas against the blocking force by offensive action. Either element may accomplish the actual destruction, but it is usually accomplished by the attacking element. This technique is most effective when the blocking force is located on, or immediately to the rear of, a natural terrain obstacle. G-5. Hammer and anvil. In this method, one or more units in the encirclement remain stationary while the others drive the guerrilla unit against it (Figure G-2). Figure G-2. Hammer and anvil technique. G-6. The wedge. This method is used after some contraction. A unit is used to divide the enemy while the encircling elements remain in place. After the guerrilla force has been broken up into smaller elements, either contraction or the hammer and anvil technique is used (Figure G-3). G-4"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 Figure G-3. Wedge technique. Section III. Civil Disturbances and Searches G-7. US involvement. While it is preferable to have host country forces control civil disturbances, US forces may be forced by circumstances to conduct them and be involved in search operations. (The type of civil disturbance provides the necessary counteraction guidelines; for detailed information refer to FM 19-15.) G-8. Search techniques. Searches are commonly used in population and resources control operations. They include use of checkpoints and roadblocks to control traffic and to reduce the capability of the guerrilla to move personnel and materiel freely. a. Special equipment required. For a checkpoint to achieve maximum results, special equipment is required. Portable signs in the native language and in English should be available. Signs should denote the speed limit of approach, vehicle search area, vehicle parking area, male and female search areas, and dismount point. Lighting is needed for the search area at night. Communication is required between the various troop units supporting the checkpoint operation. Barbed-wire obstacles G-5"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 across the road and around the search area should be provided. Troops must have adequate firepower to withstand an attack or to halt a vehicle attempting to flee or crash through the checkpoint. b. Method. The checkpoint is established by placing two parallel obstacles (each with a gap) across the road. The distance (in meters) between obstacles depends on the amount of traffic that is held in the search area. The blocked section of road can be used as the search area. If possible, there should be a place (adjacent to the road) where large vehicles can be searched without delaying the flow of other traffic (which can be dealt with more quickly). Areas are required for searching female suspects and detaining persons for further interrogation. If possible, the personnel manning a checkpoint should include a member of the civil police, an interpreter, and a trained female searcher. When searching a vehicle, all occupants are made to get out and stand clear of the vehicle. The driver should be made to observe the search of his vehicle. The searcher is always covered by an assistant. When searching, politeness and consideration are shown at all times. The occupants of the vehicle can be searched simultaneously, if sufficient searchers are available (Figure G-4). Figure G-4. Area search technique. G-6"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 G-9. Search of persons, areas. Searches can be classified as searches of individuals and searches of populated areas. a. Searching individuals. (1) Frisk search. The frisk is a quick search of an individual for weapons, evidence, or contraband. It is conducted preferably in the presence of an assistant and a witness. In conducting the frisk, the searcher stands behind the suspect. The searcher’s assistant takes a position from which he can cover the suspect with his weapon. The suspect is required to raise his arms. The searcher then slides his hands over the individual’s entire body, crushing the clothing to locate concealed objects. (2) Wall search. Based on the principle of rendering the suspect harmless by placing him in a strained, awkward position, the wall search affords the searcher a degree of safety. It is particularly useful when two searchers must search several suspects. Any upright surface, such as a wall, vehicle, or a tree, may be utilized. (a) Position of suspect. The suspect is required to face the wall (or other object) and lean against it, supporting himself with his upraised hands placed far apart and fingers spread. His feet are placed well apart, turned out, parallel to the wall, and as far from the wall as possible. His head is kept down. (b) Position of searcher’s assistant. The searcher’s assistant stands on the opposite side of the suspect (from the searcher) and to the rear. He covers the suspect with his weapon. When the searcher moves from his original position to the opposite side of the suspect, the assistant also changes position. The searcher walks around his assistant during this change to avoid coming between his assistant and the suspect. (c) Position of searcher. The searcher approaches the suspect from the right side. The searcher’s weapon must not be in such a position that the suspect can grab it. When searching from the right side, the searcher places his right foot in front of the suspect’s right foot and makes and maintains ankle-to-ankle contact. From this position, if the suspect offers resistance, the suspect’s right foot can be pushed back from under him. When searching from the left side of the suspect G-7"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 (3) the searcher places his left foot in front of the suspect’s left foot and again maintains ankle-to-ankle contact. (d) Initial position. In taking his initial position, the searcher should be alert to prevent the suspect from suddenly attempting to disarm or injure him. The searcher first searches the suspect’s headgear. The searcher then checks the suspect’s hands, arms, right side of the body, and right leg, in sequence. The searcher repeats the procedure in searching the suspect’s left side. He crushes the suspect’s clothing between his fingers; he does not merely pat it. He pays close attention to armpits, back, waist, legs and tops of boots or shoes. Any item found that is not considered a weapon or evidence is replaced in the suspect’s pocket. If the suspect resists or attempts escape and has to be thrown down prior to completing the search, the search is started over from the beginning. (e) Switch of multiple suspects. When two or more suspects are to be searched, they must assume a position against the same wall or object but far enough apart so that they cannot reach one another. The searcher’s assistant takes his position a few paces to the rear of the line with his weapon ready. The search is begun with the suspect on the right of the line. On completing the search of one suspect, he is moved to the left of the line and resumes the positon against the wall. Thus, in approaching and searching the next suspect, the searcher is not between his assistant and a suspect. Strip search. This type of search is usually necessary when the individual is suspected of being a guerrilla leader or important messenger. The search is conducted preferably in an enclosed space, such as a room or tent. The searching technique can be varied. One method is to use two unarmed searchers while an assistant, who is armed, stands guard. The suspect’s clothing and shoes are removed and searched carefully. A search is then made of his person, including his mouth, nose, ears, hair, armpits, crotch, and other areas of possible concealment. (4) Search of females. The guerrilla force will make maximum use of females for all types of tasks where search may be a threat. Counterguerrilla forces must make maximum use of female searchers. If female searchers cannot be provided, a doctor or aidman should be considered for use in searching female suspects. The search of females is an extremely G-8"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 delicate matter. When male soldiers must search females, every possible measure must be taken to prevent even the slightest inference of sexual molestation or assault. b. Searching populated areas. There are four fundamentals used when conducting a search. (1) (2) (3) (4) Approach. On some operations, the situation may allow mounted movement directly into the area to be searched. On others, the situation may dictate dismounted movement into the area. Emphasis is placed on rapid and coordinated entrance into the area. Surrounding the area. During darkness, troops approach silently by as many different routes as possible. At first daylight, the area can be occupied by a chain of observation posts with gaps covered by patrols. Normally, a large area cannot be completely surrounded for any length of time because of the number of troops required. If necessary, troops dig in, take advantage of natural cover, and use barbed wire to help maintain their line. Reserves. If there is a chance that hostile elements from outside the area could interfere, measures are taken to prevent them from joining the inhabitants of the area under search. Air observers can assist by detecting and giving early warning of any large-scale movement toward the occupied area. Search parties. (a) The officer in command of the operation informs the inhabitants that the area is to be searched, that a house curfew is in force, and that all inhabitants must remain indoors. Or, he may require the inhabitants to gather at a central point and then have the search party move in and begin the search. Search parties are usually composed of search teams. (b) When a decision is made to gather inhabitants at a central point, the head of the house should accompany the search party when his house is searched. If this is not done, he can deny knowledge of anything incrimi- nating that is found, or he can accuse the troops of theft and looting. In small searches, it may be practical to ask the head of each household to sign a certificate stating that nothing has been illegally removed, but in a large search this may be impractical. In order to avoid accusations of theft, witnesses should be present during the search. A prominent member of the com- G-9"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 munity should accompany each search team, if possible. (c) Buildings are searched from top to bottom, if possible. Mine detectors are used to search for arms and ammunition. Every effort is made to avoid unnecessary damage. Each house or building searched is marked with a coded designation. This same designation can be used to list occupants who must be accounted for in subsequent searches, and the designation helps ensure that no building is overlooked in the search. (d) If a house is vacant, or if an occupant refuses entry, it may be necessary to force entry. If a house containing property is searched while its occupants are away, it should be secured to prevent looting. Before troops depart, the commander should make arrangements with the community to protect such houses until the occupants return. (5) Search teams. (a) Special teams may be formed for search operations. In searching small areas (a few buildings), small units can conduct a search without special teams for each function. (b) Search teams may require these capabilities: • Ž Ž • Ž Ž Ž • Ž • • Ž Reconnaissance. Physical or visual search. Fire support. Control. Prisoner detection. Mine detection. Scout dogs. Riot control agents, flame weapons, and demo- litions. Tunnel reconnaissance team. Interrogation. Documentation. Psychological/civil affairs operations. G-10"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 (6) House search. Each search party assigned to search an occupied building should consist of at least one local policeman, a protective escort, and a female searcher, if appropriate. The search party must first assemble everyone. The civil police may give the necessary orders and do the actual searching. The object of this search is to screen for suspected persons. Apprehended persons are evacuated as soon as possible. Troops may perform this task. Escort parties and transportation must be planned in advance. (7) Village search. (a) Prior to conducting search operations in a village, a reconnaissance patrol is sent out to gain information about the village and its inhabitants. The patrol avoids detection. A portion of the patrol maintains surveillance over the village while the remainder of the patrol returns with information. This is done to detect any changes which may take place prior to the security element going into position. Information of value to a commander includes: Ž Size and exact location of the village. • Fortifications (mantraps, spiketraps). Ž Warning systems. Ž Tunnel systems. • Where does the insurgent live? Does he live in the forest at night and inhabit the village during the day, or does he stay in the village night and day? Does he inhabit one or more huts? • How many people are there in the village? (b) The security and search elements use one of two general methods of movement. • If aviation support is available, a quick-strike air assault operation is employed. This type of operation is characterized by speed. Ž If the elements conduct a dismounted operation, they normally use designated routes. This type of operation is characterized by secure and rapid movement. Ž A village may be searched as follows: Ž First method – assemble inhabitants in a central location (if they appear to be hostile). This method provides maximum control, facilitates a thorough search, denies insurgents an opportunity to conceal G-11"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 evidence, and allows for detailed interrogation. It has the disadvantage of taking the inhabitants away from their dwellings, thus encouraging looting which, in turn, engenders ill feelings. • Second method — restrict inhabitants to their homes. This method prohibits movement of civilians, allows them to stay in their dwellings, and discour- ages looting. The disadvantages are that it makes control and interrogation difficult and gives inhabitants time to conceal evidence in their homes. Ž Third method — control head of household. The head of each household is told to remain in front of his house while all others are brought to a central location. During the search, the head of each household accompanies the search team through his house. Looting is minimized, and the head of the household can see that the search team did not steal property. This is the best method for controlling the population. (d) Search teams must search thoroughly for insurgent personnel, equipment, escape tunnels, or caches. Cattle pens, wells, haystacks, gardens, fence lines, and cemeteries should be investigated. Search teams are constantly alert for booby traps. (e) After the house search is completed, the perimeter and area between the security element and the village is searched. There are two methods: Ž One — if the security element has not been discovered, the search element may be formed into sections, each section searching a portion of the perimeter. Should any section flush an insurgent out of the vegetation or tunnel exit, the security element captures the person, or shoots at him, if he attempts to escape. • Two — if the security element has been discovered, it conducts the perimeter search. Part of this element keeps the village isolated, while the remainder conducts the search. Such a search could take hours if the terrain is extremely dense. Regardless of the terrain, the search unit checks possible locations for caches of materiel or insurgents in hiding. (f) In areas where tunnels have been reported, it is imperative that the search unit have a tunnel recon- G-12"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 naissance team attached. This team should be composed of volunteers trained for this type of operation. They should have special equipment such as flashlights or miner helmets, protective masks, communication with the surface, and silencer-equipped pistols. They should know how to sketch a tunnel system, and they should recover all items of intelligence interest. Section IV. Movement Security G-10. T WO categories. Movement security can be divided into two categories: security of convoys with strong security detachments, and security of convoys with weak security detachments. G-11. Strong convoy security. a. b. c. d. e. Special combined-arms teams may be organized and trained to accompany and protect convoys. The security detachment is organized with adequate combat power to suppress guerrilla ambushes. Its size and composition depend upon the physical characteristics of the area, the capability of the enemy force, and the size and composition of the convoy. In any case, the security detachment should have the following subordinate elements: (1) A headquarters element to provide command, control, and communication. (2) A medical support element. (3) An armored element to provide firepower and shock effect. (4) A mechanized or motorized infantry element. (5) A combat engineer element to make minor repairs to bridges and roads and to detect and remove mines and obstacles. For large convoys, the security detachment should include field artillery. Ideally, half of the artillery would be placed well forward in the column and half near the rear of the column. The artillery command and control element would move in the vicinity of the security detachment headquarters. This arrangement allows the most flexibility for providing artillery fire support to elements of the column in the event of ambush. The combined-arms security detachment is usually interspersed throughout the convoy so that the various elements can be employed either as a fixing element or attacking element, as required. The formation of a security detachment and its integration into a convoy varies because the enemy may be expected to observe G-13"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 f. g. h. i. j. k. l. convoy patterns and prepare their ambushes to cope with expected formations. Tanks lead the convoy to gain maximum advantage from their mobility and firepower. If no tanks are available, a heavy vehicle with sandbags placed to protect personnel from mines should lead the convoy. A strong attack element is placed at the rear of the convoy formation where it has maximum flexibility in moving forward to attack any force attempting to ambush the head or center of the convoy. The enemy force may allow the advance guard to pass the site of the main ambush and then block the road and attack the main body and the advance guard separately. At the first indication of an ambush, vehicles attempt to move out of the kill zone. If necessary to halt, vehicles stop in place; they do not drive to the roadsides or shoulders, which may be mined. Specified individuals (following the unit SOP) immediately return fire from inside vehicles to cover dismounting personnel. These individuals dismount last under cover of fire by those who dismounted first. Upon dismounting, personnel caught in the kill zone open fire and immediately assault toward the ambush force and then establish a base of fire. Tanks open fire and maneuver toward the ambush force or to the most favorable ground in the immediate vicinity. While the engaged element continues its action to protect the convoy, the commander rapidly surveys the situation and issues orders to the designated attack elements to begin predrilled offensive maneuvers against the guerrilla force. The fire of the engaged security element is used to fix the ambush force and is coordinated with that of the attacking element. After the guerrilla force is destroyed or neutralized, security details are posted to cover convoy reorganization. The convoy commander, using the fastest communication available, briefs his commander on the engagement. Captured guerrilla personnel are interrogated as to where they planned to reassemble, and this information is reported immediately to higher headquarters. After an ambush, patrols maybe sent to interrogate and, if necessary, apprehend suspected civilians living near or along the routes of approach to the ambush positions. G-12. Weak convoy security. a. If the security detachment accompanying a convoy is too weak for decisive action against a guerrilla attack or ambush, the following principles apply: G-14"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 (1) Some of the troops are placed well forward in the convoy, and the remainder are placed a short distance to the rear. (2) Radio contact is maintained between the two groups. (3) Sharp curves, steep grades, or other areas where slow speeds are necessary are reconnoitered by foot troops before passage. b. At the first indication of ambush, leading vehicles, if the road appears clear, increase speed to the safe maximum in an effort to smash through the ambush area. Troops from vehicles halted in the ambush area dismount and immediately return fire. Troops from vehicles breaking through the ambush dismount and assault the flanks of the ambush position. Both attacking groups must exercise care that they do not fire on each other. c. If the enemy force allows the main convoy to pass through and then ambushes the rear guard, troops from the main body return and attack the flanks of the ambush position. G-15"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 APPENDIX H Related Operations Section I. General H-1. Five operations. This appendix describes the five major operations found in internal defense and development, and in foreign internal defense besides tactical operations. They are: intelligence, psychological operations, civil affairs, populace and resources control, and advisory assistance. H-2. IDAD support. While the brigade commander is primarily concerned with tactical operations in strike campaigns, he also recognizes that these five operations exist and support a whole range of activities in a COIN program. In consolidation campaigns, these operations normally take precedence, and tactical operations assume a supporting role. While the emphasis on any single operation may shift in response to the requirements of the situation, all of these operations occur simultaneously and continuously. Section Il. Intelligence H-3. Information sources. a. When operating in a counterinsurgency environment, the population is considered a major source of intelligence. Since the conflict revolves around the population, the populace usually has a wealth of information that can be exploited. b. In FID, intelligence organization requirements fall into three areas: preparedness, advice and assistance, and support of US units. (1) The first area is preparedness. In this area, intelligence requirements are generated and filled in anticipation of a counterinsurgency. This intelligence production is designed to fulfill contingency requirements. Examples of these requirements are background biographies, area studies, and order of battle for guerrilla forces in areas likely to become involved in an insurgency. (2) The second area. is advice and assistance to host country intelligence organizations. This advice and assistance is H-1"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 designed to increase the capabilities of the host country intelligence organization. (3) The third area is designed to fulfill operational requirements for committed US units. c. Some of the primary objectives of US intelligence organizations in FID are to: (1) Determine the indicators of an impending insurgency. (2) Obtain or develop enemy intelligence which can be utilized to launch surgical strikes by US forces. (3) Obtain information about the insurgent, weather, terrain, and population. (4) Reduce to a minimum insurgent espionage; subversion, and sabotage. (5) Identify the main sources of discontent among the people. (6) Identify the true nature, aims, leadership, potential power, and most likely course of action of the insurgency. (7) Identify and penetrate the insurgent infrastructure. d. The internal defense intelligence system consists of all host country military and civilian intelligence systems plus all US intelligence resources which are committed in-country to assist in preventing or defeating an insurgency. These agencies are coordinated and integrated under a single directorship in the National Internal Defense Coordination Center. The intelligence resources of committed counterguerrilla forces are an integral part of this intelligence system. National agencies are usually targeted toward more strategic demands that require long-term intelligence networks and systems. Counterguerrilla force intelligence assets are usually targeted toward tactical battlefield intelligence requirements and use intelligence gained through national systems. H-4. Intelligence production. Intelligence production in counterguerrilla operations in foreign internal defense operations is done in accordance with the intelligence cycle which consists of directing the intelligence effort, collecting raw information, processing this information into finished intelligence, and disseminating the intelligence for use by the commander and his staff. a. Directing. The intelligence effort is directed by the intelligence officer. He translates the commander’s guidance and concept of the operation into specific, prioritized intelligence requirements. H-2"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 A continuously updated collection plan provides the intelligence officer with a logical, orderly system for directing the collection effort. Ideally, it ensures that all information necessary is collected in time to be of use and that all possible sources of information are exploited by appropriate collection agencies. b. Collecting. The need to exploit all sources of information will require resourceful, flexible, and aggressive direction and coordination of the intelligence collection effort. It is essential that commanders and intelligence officers be fully aware of the capabilities and limitations of all available intelligence resources in order to make the best use of them. Among the collection techniques employed is the use of standard procedures as well as the use of expedients and improvisations necessitated or permitted by local conditions and resources, and the employment of specialized intelligence personnel and equipment which may be placed in support of the brigade. c. Processing. Processing is the phase of the intelligence cycle whereby information becomes intelligence. Raw (combat) information from all sources is evaluated, correlated, and analyzed to produce an all-source product. The effort to produce intelligence necessary to support counterguerrilla operations in foreign internal defense will require continual and close coordination with higher, subordinate, adjacent, supporting, and cooperating civil and military intelligence agencies and elements. d. Disseminating and using. The timely dissemination of available intelligence and its immediate use is of vital importance in counterguerrilla operations in foreign internal defense. Primary, alternate, and special intelligence channels of communi- cation may be established when facilities and resources permit. H-5. Civilian population. Exploitation of civilian sources of information in counterguerrilla operations normally requires a sophisticated intelligence organization which is resident within the population. However, as the counterguerilla campaign progresses, the civilian populace can be expected to volunteer increasing amounts of intelligence information within the brigade operational area. a. Type of information. Civilian sources or informants normally may be expected to provide the following information: (1) Details of the local terrain. (2) Ideological motivation and sympathies of local residents. (3) Logistical support available, or potentially available, to guerrillas operating in the area. H-3"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 (4) Potential guerrilla targets or objectives. (5) Identification of covert or part-time members of the guerrilla force. (6) Sabotage, espionage, and terrorism techniques and activities of the guerrilla and underground support organizations. (7) Weaknesses and vulnerabilities of the guerrilla force. b. (8) Psychological operations by the guerrilla force and the impact on the local population. Information source file. To expedite the evaluation of information provided by the civilian populace, it may become necessary for brigade intelligence personnel to establish records which quickly identify local sources of information and the degree of reliability of such sources. When established, this information source file should include such information as: (1) Name, photograph, and physical description of source. (2) Area in which source(s) can obtain information. (3) Factors contributing to source’s motivation to cooperate with counterguerilla forces. (4) Information collection capabilities of source, to include indication of training received. (5) Method by which source is contacted. (6) Record of payments or other remuneration, if made to source. (7) Record of productivity and reliability of source. c. Overt exploitation of civilian sources. In overt exploitation, a source is contacted openly by the intelligence officer or one of his recognizable agencies, and information is solicited directly. This method has the advantage of providing for the immediate collection of information, but frequently entails significant disadvantages, to include: (1) The information requirements of the brigade or battalion are made apparent to the source, thus entailing a security risk. (2) The source may not cooperate fully because of lack of motivation or because of fear of reprisal. d. Clandestine exploitation of civilian sources. Clandestine intelligence techniques are necessary in counterguerrilla operations in foreign internal defense to complement overt collection efforts in determining location, strength, and capability of guerrilla forces, underground cells, and civilian supporters. Normally, at brigade or battalion level, it is difficult, if not impossible, to establish an original clandestine collection or H-4"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 informant system during the time the brigade or battalion is in a particular area of operations. Therefore, the S2 should support and utilize reliable informant or clandestine collection operations being conducted by other US, allied, or host country agencies within the brigade or battalion area of interest. Intelligence collected through clandestine exploitation of civilian sources of information is made available to counterguerrilla commanders through an area control center, joint operations-intelligence center, or a similar facility established to coordinate internal defense and development operations. H-6. Counterintelligence. Counterintelligence increases the security of all forces and increases the probability of attaining surprise in operations against guerrilla forces. Adequate security measures are developed and continuously enforced to prevent penetration of the intelligence operation by hostile elements and to detect hostile elements already within the operation. Since guerrilla forces are usually numerically inferior to those of the host country, allied, and US forces opposing them, the guerrilla depends heavily on intelligence for successful operations. US brigades, in coordination with host country authorities, must habitually place emphasis on counterintelligence measures. a. Denial measures. Denial measures particularly applicable to counterguerrilla operations may include: (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) Removal of compromised informant sources from the area of operations. Restrictions on movement and communication facilities of the civilian population within the area of operations. Thorough briefing of all US, allied, and attached host country personnel in the intelligence practices and techniques used by the guerrilla and his underground support organization and on the security of information. Emphasis on the secure disposal of trash and waste matter. Employment of silent weapons by patrols. Normal activity, while preparing for operations, to preclude indication to the guerrilla force of a change in routine. Maintenance of strict security concerning current or projected logistical movements and the nature of supplies. Conduct of major troop movements under the concealment of darkness or during inclement weather and by the most rapid means of movement available. H-5"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 b. Detection measures. Appropriate detection measures in counterguerrilla operations may include: (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) Background investigations and screening of all civilians employed by, or operating with, US and host country forces, and those in civil positions. Particular attention is given to the control of guides or trackers who are familiar with the location, disposition, and objectives of the friendly forces. Surveillance of all known or suspected members of the guerrilla force and its infrastructure. Extensive employment of trip flares and ambushes in areas of suspected guerrilla reconnaissance activity. Employment of infantry scout dogs, if available, in conjunction with other security measures. Maximum emphasis on visual and electronic observation. Augmentation of organic visual aids and electronic detection devices is frequently required. Monitoring civil communication media. Employment of civil policewomen for search and interrogation of women and children. Counterintelligence screening of the entire population of settlements suspected of intelligence activities in support of guerrilla force. Wide distribution of photographs of known guerrillas or key underground personnel to assist in the apprehension. Offering rewards for information leading to the capture of informants or other agents supporting the guerrilla force. Periodic photographs of all residents of villages within the guerrilla area of influence and comparison of these photo- graphs to determine additions to, or deletions from, the population during the interim period. Issue of closely controlled identification cards to all residents of the area of operations. In counterguerrilla operations, counterintelligence activities normally are complicated by the presence of large numbers of civilians of unknown reliance; it is difficult to distinguish among the friendly, neutral, and hostile elements. All possible security measures which facilitate identification of these elements are employed continually. c. Deception measures. In counterguerrilla operations, units habitually plan and execute small-scale cover and deception. H-6"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 Section Ill. Psychological Operations H-7. Create support. Psychological operations in foreign internal defense include propaganda and other measures to influence the opinions, emotions, attitudes, and behavior of hostile, neutral, or friendly groups to support the achievement of national objectives. (For further information on psychological operations, see FM 33-1.) H-8. Brigade PSYOP. The purpose of brigade psychological operations is to enhance the probability of accomplishing the brigade’s various foreign internal defense missions. This is achieved by employing psychological principles to lessen or exploit the effects of tactical or nontactical operations upon the population and/or the guerrilla force. H-9. Concept. a. The overall psychological operation program for a given host country is established at the national level by a US-host country agency. This program provides guidelines for succeeding lower military and civilan echelons to use in the quest for popular support. b. Counterguerrilla units must ensure that their PSYOP is consistent with and supports US national objectives and the host country national PSYOP program. The brigade employs psychological operations to support its tactical strike and consolidation missions and to support intelligence operations, civil affairs operations, and advisory assistance operations. Care is exercised to ensure that the allegiance of the people is directed toward the host country rather than toward US brigade forces, and that announced programs and projects are attainable. Coordination is accomplished in the local area control center. H-10. Organization. a. The psychological operations staff officer(s) and unit(s) perform assigned missions in the same manner as other specialized units or staff members that are attached to, or placed in support of, the brigade or battalion. When such support is not available, a member or section of the unit staff is assigned responsibility for incorporating psychological operation considerations into plans, action, and operations. H-7"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 b. Psychological operation resources are provided either from higher headquarters units or from TOE resources. Psychological operation units provide, in addition to advice, support in the form of loudspeaker teams, leaflets, and various other audiovisual media. H-11. Operations. a. Properly integrated and employed in the planning and conduct of operations and activities, psychological operations can facilitate the accomplishment of the brigade’s mission. Counterguerrilla forces must consider the employment of psychological operations in all missions. Commanders and staff officers must realize that all military operations have psychological implications. PSYOP officers must be included in planning all activities. b. The establishment of support bases and operational support bases necessitates gaining the support of the populace in the vicinity. Propaganda themes stress the purpose of US support and the military civic action program; the need for laborers; the effects of pilferage on the counterguerrilla effort; and that people do not discuss US and host country military activities. c. Within an insurgency context, PSYOP has five major objectives: (1) Assist the government in gaining the support of its popu- lation. (2) Assist the government in defeating the insurgent movement. (3) Assist the government in providing psychological rehabili- tation for returnees from the subversive insurgent move- ment. (4) Establish and maintain a favorable image in the host country. (5) Influence neutral groups and the world community. d. The major tasks of US PSYOP in an insurgency (when US combat forces are not yet committed) are to: (1) Advise host country PSYOP personnel on how to best exploit government programs. (2) Recommend techniques for maintaining morale of host country forces. (3) Assist host country and US information agencies and activities in coordinating their efforts. (4) Assist host country personnel regarding PSYOP programs which will motivate the people to actively support their government. H-8"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 (5) Recommend programs which will adversely affect the in- surgent. e. The major tasks of US PSYOP personnel in an insurgency (when US combat forces have been committed) are to: (1) Coordinate PSYOP activities with host country units. (2) Advise US and host country commanders regarding insurgent activities and effects. (3) Advise US commanders regarding the psychological effects of military actions. (4) Assist in developing a PSYOP capability within host country military forces. f. There are five major target groups for PSYOP: the insurgent, the population supporting the insurgent, the uncommitted population, government personnel, and foreign audiences. Themes are tailored to each of these groups to gain maximum effective support for the government. g. When targeting the insurgent: (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) The major PSYOP objective is to discredit the insurgent and to isolate him from the population. The most important direction of attack is against insurgent unit morale. Themes should publicize and exploit differences between cadre, recruits, supporters, and the local population. Other themes might stress lack of support, isolation, homesickness, and hardships. Amnesty programs often prove useful in neutralizing insurgences. Amnesty programs are most effective when they are sincere, credible, well publicized, directed against lower ranking members of the insurgency, and offer sufficient reason and benefits for quitting the insurgent threat. Amnesty programs do, however, have several disadvantages: they recognize the insurgents as quasi-legitimate; they forgo punishment of anyone accepting amnesty; and they increase the image of the insurgent threat. h. When targeting the population supporting the insurgent: (1) The PSYOP objective is to achieve withdrawal of support for the insurgent and defection in place or person to the legitimate government. (2) Themes should highlight insurgent shortcomings, ultimate governmental victory, government successes, and the H-9 160-739 O - 94 - 9"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 practical advantages of surrendering or of accepting amnesty. i. When targeting the uncommitted population: (1) The major PSYOP mission is to build national morale, unity, and confidence in the government. (2) There should also be a major effort to win popular acceptance of the government force, and convince the people that government programs serve their interests, government forces can protect them, ultimate government victory is assured, and the people have major intelligence and counterintelligence roles to play. j. When targeting government personnel: (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) Seek to maintain loyalties and develop policies and attitudes which will result in group members who will realize the importance of popular support, promote public welfare and justice, take action to eliminate the basic causes of the subversive insurgency, and protect the population from the subversive insurgent. Indoctrinate host country security and military forces regarding the importance of the civilian population in IDAD operations. Each soldier must understand that his actions toward the people may spell the difference between success and failure. When government personnel interact with neutral and nonhostile elements of the population, the emphasis should be positive and constructive. PSYOP efforts should publicize the tangible and visible accomplishments of the legitimate government. PSYOP should discourage public apathy and activity that helps the insurgent. The people should not be asked to undertake any activity which is contrary to their own best interests. k. When targeting foreign audiences, there are two major groups to be addressed: neutral nations and hostile nations. For neutral nations, the purpose of PSYOP is to achieve friendly neutrality or active support for the legitimate government. For hostile powers, the major PSYOP objective is to influence public opinion against involvement in supporting the insurgency. l. US PSYOP attempts to establish and maintain a favorable US image. The themes most useful in establishing an image are that the US presence is requested by host country government, it is legal and necessary, it is temporary, and it is advisory. H-10"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 m. n. o. In combat actions, every effort is made to provide for the safety of the civilian population and, if possible, to separate them from the guerrilla forces so that maximum available firepower can be employed against the guerrilla. The decision to employ psychological operation media to accomplish this task is carefully weighed against compromising surprise and security. Intelligence operations are facilitated by employing psychological operation media to inform the people that they should report to the proper authority information pertaining to strangers, suspicious persons, unusual activities by neighbors, and guerrilla activities. Posters and leaflets provide definitive instruction as to persons and places that are available to receive this information. The message indicates what rewards, if any, are available. Captured or defected leaders of the guerrilla force are exploited. Written and broadcast messages prepared by these individuals and reviewed by trained psychological operation personnel are used in communities suspected of supporting guerrilla forces, and in tactical operations against guerrilla forces. Section IV. Civil Affairs H-12. Government-building. a. The civil affairs (CA) role in FID takes the form of civic assistance and civic action. b. Civic assistance is defined as providing advice and assistance to indigenous civil and military authorities in the sociological, economic, and political aspects of a civil emergency, disorder, or IDAD. It is commonly referred to as “government-building” since it is directed toward the structures of government. Military civic action is defined as the participation findigenous military forces in short-term projects which are useful to the local population and which contribute to social and economic development. c. Civic action programs are divided into long-range and short-range programs. The former deals with the resolution of social and economic problems; the latter is designed to gain and retain the loyalty of the population. d. CA operations are a responsibility of military commanders at every echelon. They include any activity of military forces concerned with relationships between the military forces and the civil authorities and people in the area. Activities may range from military civic action projects to the exercise of certain authority that normally is the responsibility of the local government. H-11"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 H-13. Operational scope. a. b. c. d. e. The scope of CA operations varies with the type of local government and is influenced by the economic, social, and political background of the country and people. Some major CA activities include: (1) Prevention of civilian interference with military operations. (2) Support of government functions. (3) Community relations. (4) Military civic action. (5) Assistance for populace and resources control. (6) Civil defense. The overall objective of CA in FID is to mobilize and motivate civilians to assist the government and military forces. The operations are directed at eliminating or reducing military, political, economic, and sociological problems. Close and continuous PSYOP support is needed to maximize the effect of CA. All military units have a capability to conduct CA, particularly military civic action. Major roles in military civic action are frequently undertaken by engineer, transportation, medical, and other units having assets suited to support military civic action projects. There are several judgmental factors that should be considered before a military unit undertakes a civic action project: (1) Is the project needed and wanted? (2) Will military participation compromise civilian authority and responsibility? (3) Does the project support the unit’s political-military mission? (4) Does the project comply with the host country FID plan? (5) Will the project duplicate other efforts? (6) Will the people be involved in the project? (7) Will there be continuity of effort? Both civic assistance and civic action are geared to the phase of insurgency they are facing. H-12"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 H-14. US role. a. The normal role of the US military in civic assistance and civic action is to advise and assist host nation military forces. Under some rare conditions, US military units may enter into direct civic action programs. b. Units as small as a battalion task force may be assigned CA elements to assist in carrying out CA plans. A civil-military operations staff officer may also be assigned to such a task force. c. CA liaison and coordination should be established between military forces and government agencies. This can be accomplished through organizations specifically designed for this purpose or through CA staff elements. d. CA operations require good relationships with the population. To establish a good relationship, troop discipline, courtesy, and honesty in dealings with the people are emphasized. Where rapport has been established between host country forces and the population, properly administered CA operations contribute to the attainment of FID objectives. H-15. Planning – five phases. a. CA planning includes political, economic, social, psychological, and military considerations. These considerations include: (1) A national development plan that involves projects which support development programs that meet the needs and desires of the people. Civic actions projects conducted simply for the want of something to do may be counterproductive. (2) Military civic action projects conducted by military forces. (3) CA personnel and units required to support host country agencies at subnational levels. (4) CA mobile training team requirements and resources. (5) CA training program requirements for host country and allied forces. (6) CA requirements to provide (where needed) government administration in areas of the country. b. CA responsibilities assigned to a tactical unit commander may require the employment of specialized civil affairs personnel or units. Host country CA plans should include provisions for CA support to tactical unit commanders. (For further information on CA organization, see FM 41-10.) c. Emphasis on military civic action varies with the intensity of insurgent activities. Whatever the level of military civic action, H-13"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 d. e. projects are planned and coordinated with internal development programs. During Phase I of an insurgency, military civic action concentrates on the development of the socio-economic environment. In the absence of tactical operations, many military resources may be devoted to military civic action projects providing both long-range and short-range benefits. During Phases II and III, military civic action is concentrated on projects designed to prevent intensification of the insurgency. These projects produce noticeable improvements in a relatively short time. Examples of such projects are farm-to-market roads, bridges, short-range educational programs, basic hygiene, medical immunization programs, and simple irrigation projects. Advice is sought on projects to ensure they are needed, wanted, and coincide with development plans for the area. In the advanced stages of insurgency, priorities on military operations may reduce military civic action to such immediate tasks as providing medical aid to civilians and procuring and distributing food and shelter for displaced persons. Section V. Populace and Resources Control H-16. Population protection. a. Population and resources control (P&RC) operations are generally classified as nontactical, police-type operations. b. Populace and resources control is government action to protect the populace and its materiel resources and to deny those resources which would further hostile objectives against the government. c. The objective of populace and resources control operations is to assist in preserving or reestablishing a state of law and order within a nation or area. There are three main tasks involved in reaching this objective: (1) Providing security for the populace. (2) Detecting and neutralizing the insurgent apparatus. (3) Severing any relationship between the insurgent and the populace. H-17. Forces available. a. There are three forces available to conduct populace and resources control operations: (1) The civil police are the first line of defense in the battle against an insurgency. H-14"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 (2) Paramilitary forces may augment or assist the civil police. (3) The nation's military forces should reemployed only when civil police and paramilitary units cannot cope with the insurgent activity. Even then, priority should be given to employing military police units rather than combat forces. b. Control of the populace and resources should be performed by host country agencies. This is a matter of practicality, but there are also legal and psychological implications. US military should be used as a last resort and only as augmentation to host country units. Military police should be utilized before combat troops. c. Populace and resources control measures can be classified into three categories: (1) Surveillance of individuals, groups, activities, or locations by overt or covert means. (2) Restrictions such as curfews, travel permits, registration of firearms, national registration and identification of all persons, and control of selected foodstuffs, medical supplies, and equipment. (3) Enforcement through the use of roadblocks, checkpoints, rewards, amnesty programs, and selective inspections of homes at night. d. These control measures should be well-planned and coordinated to ensure rapid and efficient operations, with a minimum of delay and inconvenience to the people. e. Populace and resources control is designed to complement and support other counterguerrilla operations and environmental improvements being conducted by the military forces, and to contribute to the overall stability of the country or the operational area. H-18. Central theme. a. The central theme of populace and resources control is population protection and resource management. PSYOP should convey this theme and be designed to accomplish the following: (1) Persuade the people to accept the necessary measures, priority to their implementation. (2) Convince the people that their full support will minimize the inconvenience of the measures. (3) Place the blame for any inconveniences or discomfort squarely upon the insurgents. b. Border operations are taken (as part of populace and resources control) to isolate the insurgent from his outside support. Outside H-15"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 support covers a variety of activities. It may range from provision of funds and training of individual insurgents by an outside power to providing an active sanctuary for combat forces. c. The most frequent populace and resources control operations US units may participate in are: (1) Border operations. (2) Cordon and search. (3) Augmentation of enforcement operations (roadblocks, checkpoints). Section VI. Advisory Assistance H-19. Tactical backup. a. Advisory assistance is advice and assistance provided by US personnel to host country regular, paramilitary, and irregular forces and to civilian agencies to help them become effective in the performance of their missions. b. These activities support and, in turn, are supported by tactical operations, intelligence operations, psychological operations, populace and resources control operations, and military civic action. Such assistance is designed to: (1) Provide military assistance in conjunction with the Navy and Air Force to the host country. (2) Participate with other services in joint internal defense training and exercises as mutually agreed upon by the services concerned. (3) Provide mobile training teams, combat service support, and combat support to advise, train, assist, and support host country forces. H-20. Army assistance. a. The primary purpose of US Army assistance is to increase the capabilities of host country armed forces. b. The brigade may be required to organize, train, equip, and advise host country civil and military personnel and units to perform counterguerrilla missions. Tasks include: (1) Organizing, equipping, training, and advising paramilitary and irregular forces (locally recruited) to assume local defense missions from the brigade. (2) Equipping, training, and advising host country regular armed forces on new equipment provided by military H-16"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 assistance programs (MAP) and foreign military sales (FMS). (3) Organizing, equipping, training, and advising host country police organizations. (4) Advising host country regular armed forces, paramilitary forces, and local governments in all aspects of internal defense and development. c. Brigade advisory assistance to host country personnel and organizations, as differentiated from military civic action, usually is performed to extend security assistance activities. Such activities as organizing, equipping, training, and advising host country forces may be accomplished while in base areas or during the defensive phase of consolidation operations of counterguerrilla tactical operations. d. If US military assistance organizations are operational, advisors usually are provided for this purpose. However, in cases where US advisors or mobile training teams are not available, brigades may be required to assume this function. Advisory assistance is coordinated closely with both the internal defense and the internal development programs through the local area control center. H-21. Brigade organization. a. All brigade organizations should be prepared to provide individuals or teams capable of performing advisory assistance within their areas of specialization, if the need arises. Organization for advisory assistance operations may require the tailoring of specific teams to accomplish specific missions: (1) (2) (3) (4) Military police, augmented by brigade elements, may be required to train host country military police organizations in the area, while combined arms teams may be required to train local host country artillery and armor units in artillery and armor tactics and techniques. Training centers may be required if the training load is sufficient to warrant them. Teams from brigade units may be organized for on-duty training of host country specialists. These specialists are trained in the use of specialized equipment which is organic to brigades but which will be supplied to host country forces at some future date. Mobile training teams formed by the brigade may be dispatched to local host country forces to conduct training at host country unit bases or training centers. H-17"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 b. Advisory assistance operations inherently involve the requirement to use advisory techniques. Consequently, tact, discretion, language qualification, expertness in the subject, and other qualifications normally associated with US advisors and advisory operations must be stressed. (For further information on policy governing advisory assistance activities, see FM 100-5 and FM 100-20.) H-18"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"FM 90-8 APPENDIX I Staff Functions I-1. General.

If and when US forces are deployed to a host country to assist in a counterinsurgency conflict, tactical operations will probably be joint in nature, and it is likely that US forces will be working with, or in support of, the military and paramilitary forces of the host country. J-2. Nature of Combined Operations. a. Combined operations require prior written agreement as to authority, jurisdiction, and procedural and organizational matters. The legal basis for combined operations is usually a treaty or operational agreement between the US and the host country. b. US forces must plan to coordinate and work with the military or paramilitary forces. Commanders and staffs must be prepared to establish workable arrangements rapidly, once introduced into a host country, if not done prior to deployment. Every situation will be unique and will depend upon the extent of involvement of US forces and the nature of the operations. c. Planning for factors that must be taken into consideration will benefit combined operations. Chief considerations are: (1) Command and control. (2) Intelligence. (3) Operational procedures. (4) Combat service support. J-3. Command and Control. Establish: a. Organization of the combined force. b. Overall command of the force. c. Roles and/or missions of the combined force. d.
