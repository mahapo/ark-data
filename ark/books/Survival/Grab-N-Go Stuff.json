I’ve updated the contents somewhat since then, and so I thought I’d share them with you. Caveat: What follows is tailored to the needs of our famil y of five adults, and can keep us going in the car, under almost any cond itions, for about five days to a week. Your needs, tastes and preferences may vary, and probably will. Feel free to amend the contents of your bags accordingly. The assumption here is that we have about fifteen m inutes’ warning of impending catastrophe, and we have to get the hell out of Dodge Plano quickly, in one car (currently, our KIA Sportage SU V). Space is more of a premium now than it was in the old Suburban, so we’ ve condensed a lot of it. 1. Pre-Arrangements. Each kid has taped to the back of their bedroom doo r a list of duties and supplies that they are responsible for. They are pe rmitted one small carry bag each for clothes, toiletries, prescription medi cations and such (contents specific to each kid, of course), and their duties include ” help Dad load the car ”, ” help Mom pack supplies ”, ” put out food for the cats and leash up the dog ”, and so on. Each family member also has on hand at all times: a cell phone; a Swiss Army knife (Champ or similar); a Surefire 6P flashl ight or equivalent; and a folding knife. Not pictured in what follows is our water supply , which consists of about 40 gallons of water in 5-gal jugs, two trays of bottle d spring water, as well as a couple trays of Gatorade. Those all accompany the g rab ‘n go tubs. All the SHTF stuff is stored inside our “disaster room” (actual ly, our walk-in closet under the stairs), thus serving a dual purpo se. 2. Grab ‘n Go Containers We have two Rubbermaid tubs to carry all our SHTF supplies. As I said earlier, they’re waterproof enough —not enough to survive complete submersion, but enough to keep out heavy rain. And everything which can possibly be damaged by water is kept inside zip-loc k bags anyway. We went with these because they’re sturdy, light and inexpensive. Each one can be carried by a single person.

Major Tools The military entrenching tool is a given. The roofi ng hammer is an excellent utility tool: axe and hammer in one. The “blue” bag contains an air mattress, and on top is a “bag o’ bags”, with lots of trash b ags and such. The two mini-saws are not intended for any kind of heavy sa wing, just for kindling and firewood (I’ll replace them with serious draw-s tring saws at some point). The Leatherman complements the other tools in the c ar’s toolbox (which is always packed, and contains most tools and spares r equired to keep the car running). Grundig battery/handcranked FM/AM/SW radio, canteen s, large knife, water- purifiers, slingshot and shot, and reserve .22 ammo . As for the “Hayes” bag, it contains not a modem but a backup gun [ nunya ], and its caliber is betrayed by the two Big Green ammo boxes (which als o contain a few rounds of backup .45 Colt).

Grab ‘n Go Guns: Each family member has a handgun [ nunya ], which would be packed/carried as their individual responsibility, with at least o ne spare mag of ammo. Long guns are stored in carry cases set aside for this p urpose, and include: two assault rifles (and 100-odd rounds of ammo), one sh otgun (50 rounds) and two .22 rifles (500 rounds). Remember: we’re buggin g out, not going to war—although obviously, if circumstances look like being a little more ummm desperate , then it’s an easy matter just to grab a couple of ammo cans full on the way out. (I store all my ammo in a mmo cans, and I think that it’s a decent habit to get into.) Summary So: it’s \u0001 two bins \u0001 rifle cases \u0001 the water \u0001 a cooler full of ice \u0001 the luggage \u0001 two extra gasoline cans (10 gallons total, or about 3/4 tank for the Kia). Fifteen minutes , and we’re gone. Thirty minutes, and we can add more food (maybe another b in, or perishables in the cooler) and cooking equipment fo r a longer stay. One hour , and we can add the roof-carrier with extra stuff.

Well done and fairly comprehensive. Although I am not real keen on tinned beef, it looks impressive. If it is not a drill and you do have to bug out, I would recommend a quick purchase of fresh fruit if you ha ve time for that. Your first aid kit is admirable. Your collect ion is well thought out. Old Trooper | 11/10/2008 07:39 AM CST | #137400 2. Before it gets overlooked, I just want to remind that Kim made quite clear that this was our grab-n-go, for our family, and for where we live. When I lived in Los Angeles, my emergency preparedn ess focused more on earthquakes. If someone lives in a snow region, there would need to be more emphasis on tha t, ditto for drought, flood, ice storms (resulting in days of po wer loss), etc. I think a good rule of thumb is to think about the disasters in the last 10 years, to your region, and then think o f what you’d want/need to survive that, and the duration. Bugging out is a last resort, except for temporary situations, such as a hurricane in our area. In other emergenc y situations, the best place to be is home. If our power was out , we have other means of cooking. Winters in our area are no t severe (we seldom turn the heat on). A summer season disaster would mean we’d be hot without A/C, but that would be uncomfortable, not life-threatening. Our disaster closet is where the family goes during a tornado warning (an interior room with no windows, with the structural support of the stairs above it), but someone else m ay have a basement to store their supplies, or their garage i s a better choice. Our garage is not insulated and not a plac e to go during a tornado, and because of the clay soil and water t able, we don’t have basements in this region. Connie | 11/10/2008 07:48 AM CST | #137401 3. I’m glad to see the superglue in your kit. Not only does it fit under the Fastenings list, but it also fits under t he Medical list. Superglue sticks skin together VERY well and is han dy for cuts that are messy, e.g. cuts from a serrated edge such as your Spyderco. Another easy and cheap addition to a HOLYSH#T kit cou ld be a small bottle of bleach . Only a few drops will sterilize about 1/2 gallon of water, so just a small bottle make LO TS of drinking water. It’s been used for a long time by outdoorsm en and I’ve never heard of any problems from it. I used it to turn swamp water into potable water when hiking through the Fl orida Everglades and had no problems.

Absolutely admirable. I’ve finally managed to accumulate most all of this for my family and then some, including nearly a year supply of fo od . . . now for the (seemingly) daunting task of organizing the essentials in a manner that can be packed into the rig in a hurry in case we bug out. Of course in the rural area where I live, a bug-out situation is very unlikely and we’d be best off to hunker down r ight here where our shelter, food, clothing, tools, firewood for heating and cooking, water from well and nearby stream are all in place. Neighbors are few and friendly. But still, you’ve inspired me to get some tubs read y. Danny Boy | 11/10/2008 08:27 AM CST | #137408 6. The Listening to Katrina series helped me re-evaluate how to setup for emergencies. The concepts for protecting wealth, which Shane is the first I’ve seen to really cover in a detailed way, are good things to think about. aczarnowski | 11/10/2008 08:27 AM CST | #137409 7. About the only difference in my kits is I use the blue “mechanics” towels instead of traditional paper tow el. It’s pretty tough stuff. I used about this same checklist for Africa- though I left out a lot of the “Big” items like e-tools and tarps (thos e were there when we got there) and food (we killed what we ate, or went hungry)and it served me quite well. og | 11/10/2008 08:53 AM CST | #137416 8. The tampons are great for mild to moderate wound care, and they’re far more cost effective than a product I ra n across in a magazine a few years ago. Z-Medica makes an array of clotting items in their QuikClot brand; a granulated type hemostatic agent that you pour on/in to the wound as well as different types and sizes o f gauze and sponges with the same clotting agent as the granule s, impregnated in the sponge. Very pricey , but supposedly quite effective. They have a type with a ionic silver to keep bacterial growth at bay too, in case it takes some time to ge t good medical care. The clotting agent is an exothermic reaction when i t contacts the blood, so it will probably induce a sensation of bu rning, but beats the alternative of bleeding to death. Limite d application, but it may be worth having on hand in your BOB. I d o. Should be available at Cabela’s, if you live near o ne, in the camping section, or online, obviously. Just a thought. theirritablearchitect | 11/10/2008 09:18 AM CST | #137422 9. We live in the San Joaquin Valley, Ppl’s Sov of K haleefornya. Dull place: no fires, floods or quakes.

When you’re ready to upgrade those walkie-talkie s, you might want to consider becoming licensed amateur radio op erators and getting HTs. They’re quite a bit more powerful and versatile, which, in an emergency situation, would give you mo re communications options. For instance, I have a Yae su FT-60R, which is dual-band (2m/70cm), powerful (5W transmit power), rugged, able to run on AA batteries (with an option al battery case), and inexpensive (under $200). It’s popular among emergency communications responders for all those r easons. I also have a Yaesu VX-170, which is similar to the F T-60R except it’s 2-meter only, and it can share the FT-60R’s ba ttery packs; it’s even less expensive (about $120). There are other options available, too, not just from Yaesu, but from other manufacturers such as Kenwood and ICOM. Yes, you have to go get a license to use those, but it’s not an onerous barrier, certainly no worse than a CCW perm it. The FCC dropped the Morse code requirements for all cla sses of ham radio license not long ago, and the Technician clas s license--for which the exam is fairly simple for intelligent peo ple such as yourselves--gives you all the privileges you’d need for those radios. And I think you’ll find that a lot of hams out there have a similar interest in emergency preparedness. Just something I’d noticed and would submit for you r consideration. 73’s from KD0BSZ.

Gran ted, a kid or two might have to put their bag on the floor in front o f them, but a little discomfort is better than the alternative. Kim | 11/10/2008 10:39 AM CST | #137441 13. And we have a roof rack. We’d just need the time to put the clamshell on the car to make it really useful. Connie | 11/10/2008 10:41 AM CST | #137444 14. I have a seven passenger SUV and three small kid s. It’s shocking how quickly the big SUV fills up with nece ssities. When we go camping for the weekend, were lucky if w e can fit everything in there. Which just goes to show the i mportance of pre-planning. I figure in a bug out situation, we’d be on our own for at least 72 hours so all meals, beverages accommodations and security are my responsibility. That’s at least 45 meals, 4 5 privy visits and depending on the weather here in the North East a boat load of sleeping bags coats, fuel and the like. Po int is, now is the time to plan this stuff out. El Duderino | 11/10/2008 11:19 AM CST | #137451 15. Are those Rubbermaid boxes the 10 gallon size? As to treating water with chlorine, you have to wat ch the concentration. According to the US Public Health Ser vice as published in BSA Great Western Council “Footprints” Vol 3, Page 9 of 13 The Other Side of Kim du Toit - TheOtherSideofKim Front Page 11/10/2008 http://www.theothersideofkim.com/index.php/tos/sing le/19606/"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"1974: Chlorine concentration Drops per Quart 1% 10 4% -6% 2 7% -10% 1 Clorox is 6% Sodium Hypochlorite. If in doubt about concentration, use 10 drops per q uart. Double the amounts for turbid or colored water. The treated water should be mixed thoroughly and al lowed to stand 30 minutes. The water should have a slight ch lorine odor; if not, repeat dosage and allow water to stand for an additional 15 minutes. If treated water has too strong a chlor ine taste, it can be made mor palatable by allowing the water to stand exposed to air for a few hours or by pouring it fro m one clean container to another several times. Btw, the ability of chlorine bleach to purify water is a good reason to only buy the unscented variety from the m arkets if you can get it. Windy Wilson | 11/10/2008 11:23 AM CST | #137453 16. Excellent as always!!! Frigate | 11/10/2008 11:40 AM CST | #137456 17. A few things I’d consider adding 1. Potassium Iodide or Iodate - The idea is that ra dioactive fallout in the case of accident or terrorism produc es radioactive iodine which gets into your thyroid. That will caus e a nasty quick cancer. The iodate or iodide saturates the thyroid with iodine blocking the radioactive stuff. Check your med hist ory prior to a SHTF scenario 2. A good mask for each person. Again, a radioactiv e SHTF scenario can be a lot more survivable with some sim ple precautions. One is to keep the dust out. Also, I g et dead critters on the property once in a while. I’m a bit ashamed to admit but my barf level is low. I use the mask to k eep the barf reflex in control. Dead bodies would max that effec t out. 3. Add in passports if you have them AND A WAY TO HI DE THEM SECURELY 4. Consider another use of the med stuff.. Namely k eeping off of FEMA work parties. They supposedly CAN draft you fo r manual labor... JBFEMAT : “You Vill Grab Dis Shovel Schnell” You “Gee, as you can see from this splint on my leg I have a fractured shin” JBFEMAT :\"Verry Vell, you are exchused.. “ 5 If you have a fish pond you might want to stock u p on some antibiotics for your fish.. You never know when you might run into a pond full of sick Koi somewhere. Of course, it would be against federal law to give those to a human even i n an emergency so we won’t do that right?? 6. They sell book type topo maps that cover a state level. These could be real handy especially if you know how to r ead them anyway, thanks for this post kim. I’m going to dust off my Y2k planners. Bullseye | 11/10/2008 12:33 PM CST | #137468 18. You want to replace those saws with one of these . The smaller one folds up into something the size of a fat ruler ( that would be the measuring device ... heh ), 17\" x 1 3/4” x 5/8”. When I used to work for the Forest Diservice, we us ed them exclusively for light sawing duties on wilderness c rews ( for big jobs we used a chainsaw, or a crosscut inside the w ilderness areas ). Indestructable, light, and they work. kbarrett | 11/10/2008 01:26 PM CST | #137481 Page 10 of 13 The Other Side of Kim du Toit - TheOtherSideofKim Front Page 11/10/2008 http://www.theothersideofkim.com/index.php/tos/sing le/19606/"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"19. Totally and completely f***ing brilliant. Yet a nother thing Kim reminded me of over the years was to BE PREPARED to take care of myself and my family when the SHTF without r elying on anyone, particularly the gummint. Thank you, Kim. Also, great advice from the Mrs. I have three smal l kids, so bugging out of home base is definitely last resort. However, I want to be prepared if it happens, as it would defi nitely be close to panic time at that point and nobody thinks well under that kind of stress. Accordinlgy, that is exactly when being prepared with Grab N’ Go and having a plan would really pay off. Also, just going throught the exercise of Grab ‘N G o got me motivated to be more prepared at home in general, a s I started to think of what it would take to support my family for a month or more if the thin veneer of society was temporari ly scratched away (see Katrina or Urkel losing). Not that I have gone all survivalist, but I found it quite staggering to see on paper what I would really need to put away and then be prepared to defend. Anyway, I think the possibility is pretty remote bu t it seems to me that options quickly dissappear once the Black S wan is in the pond, so I’d rather be prepared. dbrown | 11/10/2008 01:38 PM CST | #137487 20. Be careful with the quick-clot stuff. Because it is exothermic, you must keep it out of your lungs and eyes, lest y ou suffer some fairly severe injuries. If you can, score some ciprofloxacin and some clind amycin. Most infections can be treated effectively with those tw o antibiotics. Oh, Flagyl ,too. I read the voices of Katrina series, as well, and f ound it to be very insightful. I like the 1 minute/ 1 hour/ 1 day preparation levels. I keep a jump bag in the truck (which can sustain f or 72 hours) because if I do need to scram in 60 seconds, then I already have a good start. I just get my laptop, our important d ocs safe, and the rifle bag. I also have a tub full of stuff stag ed in the garage with camping gear. That just about takes 60 seconds to get in the truck. Then, I am GONE . Give me an hour, and I can get a couple of cases of ammo, another rifle, more clothe s, more food, and more mementos. doc Russia | 11/10/2008 02:12 PM CST | #137497 21. If you can, score some ciprofloxacin and some clindamycin. Most infections can be treated effectively with those two antibiotics. Oh, Flagyl ,too. ::Goes through her address book, thinking about who she knows who might be able to do that:: Connie | 11/10/2008 02:16 PM CST | #137498 22. Just a thought, but if you’ve been having a good ly number of enquiries, is this a business opportunity for you? You might consider substituting some honey for the sugar: not only is it a sweetener but it keeps better and is u seful for treating wounds. Quentin | 11/10/2008 02:24 PM CST | #137500 23.

Quentin | 11/10/2008 03:08 PM CST | #137509 25. I second Quentin’s suggestion. Also, does anyon e have any ideas for those of use up here in the great white n orth, a lot of this stuff, including the containers, do no handle -40 degrees very well. vivictius | 11/10/2008 03:15 PM CST | #137511 26. I will third that, and I believe that makes quor um. Kim you just got a new career! Great work on this one. Martini | 11/10/2008 03:44 PM CST | #137516 27. Bug Spray! Mosquitos love me, so I have it stash ed about everyone possible in house and car. And for those who wear glasses/contacts, pack an extra pair with eye wash solution. nativetexan | 11/10/2008 04:19 PM CST | #137519 28. Forget it. Too time-consuming, and too heavy to ship. That’s why I posted the piece—so everyone can get o ff their fat asses and buy the stuff themselves. There’s even a checklist and everything... Sheeesh. Kim | 11/10/2008 06:35 PM CST | #137526 29. Kim’s Major Wound Solution: 1. Wash out with spring water and povidone. 2. Cover with sanitary towel/tampon. 3. Bandage and duct tape. 4. Find a doctor and make him fix it, à la James Caan in A Bridge Too Far . Kim | 11/10/2008 06:38 PM CST | #137528 30.
