General a. The term medical threat is defined as ìa collective term used to designate all potential or continuing enemy actions and environmental situations that could adversely affect the combat effectiveness of friendly forces, to include wounds, injuries, or sickness incurred while engaged in a joint operation.î (Joint Publication 4-02). In Army and multiservice publications, the term is defined as a composite of all ongoing potential enemy actions and environmental conditions (disease and nonbattle injuries [DNBIs]) that may render a soldier combat ineffective. Commanders and unit leaders are responsible for protecting and preserving Army personnel and equipment against injury, damage, or loss that may result from food-, water-, and arthropodborne diseases, as well as environmental injuries (for example, heat and cold injuries) and occupational hazards. b. The term health threat refers to an individual soldierís health. The term can include hereditary conditions which manifest themselves in adulthood, individual exposure to an industrial chemical or toxin where others are not exposed, or other injuries and traumas which affect an individualís health rather than the health of the unit. For example, an individual who has a food allergy inadvertently eats the offending food; he may become incapacitated with diarrhea but the remainder of the unit is not affected by this condition. On the other hand, in a unit where 40 to 50 percent of its personnel contract Salmonella (an infectious disease), the unit can no longer complete its mission. A health threat may be more individualized in nature and may not be of any military significance. The significant difference in these terms lies with the effects on the ability of a military unit to successfully execute its mission. c. The elements of the medical threat include infectious diseases that occur naturally, but are not limited toó ï Diseases endemic to the AO. ï Environmental factors (heat, cold, humidity, and significant elevations above sea level). ï Diseases caused by zoonotic/animal bites. ï The presence of poisonous animals, plants, and insects. (These are important considerations as causative agents of DNBI casualties.) ï Diseases stemming from weapons of mass destruction (WMD) (such as nuclear, biological, and chemical [NBC], and directed-energy [DE] weapons/devices such as radiation composed of three typesóradio frequency, laser, and charged particle beam). Blast effect weapons, such as fuel and air explosives, represent an emerging medical threat. This includes terrorist (individuals or groups) actions directed against defenseless targets. ï Prolonged periods of intense, continuous operations under all types of conditions that tax soldiers to the limits of their physiological and emotional endurance."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"1-2 FM 4-02.17 1-2. Historical Perspective Throughout history, DNBI resulting from medical threats (including, but not limited to, heat, cold, and disease) have accounted for more losses to fighting forces than combat-related injuries. Even prominent military personalities, such as Alexander, Hannibal, Frederick, and Napoleon, suffered setbacks due to loss of forces as a result of DNBI. Despite considerable advances in the technology of war, the medical threat still presents a significant danger to our forces. For example: a. Lebanon Intervention of 1958 . Half of the deployed US force in Beirut suffered the misery of diarrhea. Five percent of those were sick enough to require hospitalization. b. Vietnam War in the Republic of Vietnam . Nearly half the US troops deployed to Vietnam had one or more significant bouts with diarrhea during their first 4 months in country. c. Sinai Campaign in Egypt, 1967 . Twenty percent of the entire Egyptian force deployed across the peninsula died from heat, even though the war only lasted a few days. d. Jerusalem Campaign in Israel, 1967 . Forty percent of Israeli infantry units operating within the ancient city contracted cutaneous leishmaniasis. e. Canal Clearance Operation in Egypt, 1975 . Eighty percent of the US Navy personnel deployed to Egypt in support of clearance operations suffered diarrhea and dysentery from eating in poorly maintained food service facilities. f. Operation Bright Star in Egypt, 1980 . The exercise ended miserably for many US troops because of diarrhea and dysentery. They had eaten in civilian restaurants just before returning home. g. Peacekeeping Operations in the Sinai, 1982 . Thirty percent of one US airborne company was incapacitated by the Sinai heat and required intravenous (IV) fluids to recover from dehydration. h. Operation Just Cause, Republic of Panama, 1989 . Many US personnel suffered heat prostration/injuries due to a lack of acclimatization and a shortage of drinking water. Airborne personnel jumped into the mangrove swamps around Panama City without adequate amounts of water to drink. Each individual only had one canteen of water. The water in these swamps is brackish (salt) water; therefore, the personnel could not refill their canteens and treat the water with iodine tablets. Unit combat lifesavers cut off the tops of 500 cubic centimeter (cc) IV solution bags and had the individuals drink the solution to relieve the heat effects. i. Operation Desert Shield/Operation Desert Storm in Saudi Arabia, 1990-1991 . At ports and other large troop concentration areas, sanitation safeguards were nonexistent or poorly controlled. In order to get to showers, soldiers had to pass through areas where human waste was leaking from outdoor latrines (some were positioned too closely). These conditions along with other sanitation problems, contributed to many cases of Shigella (a diarrheal disease). j. Operation Restore Hope in Somalia, 1993-1994 . In the process of upgrading and moving a unit to a new location, a US unit selected an area that had been occupied by a coalition force. The"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"1-3 FM 4-02.17 assumption was made that because these forces had found the area suitable that it would probably accommodate the unitís soldiers. After expending considerable time and resources on construction of facilities in the area, the unit contacted the surgeon to assist in dealing with a fly problem. When the PVNTMED team arrived, they quickly discovered that the source of the flies was a dump adjacent to the site into which Somalis were discharging raw sewage. The solution was to relocate the unit to another area. k. Haiti. US personnel did not employ personal protective measures against arthropodborne diseases. They failed to correctly use the insect repellent, permethrin, and bed nets. Failure to use these protective measures contributed to a dengue fever rate of over 30 percent among febrile hospitalized soldiers. l. Bosnia . One US dining facility was implicated in an outbreak of Salmonella . The cooks were preparing eggs that had been in an unrefrigerated container express (CONEX) for days. The food service manager ordered the remaining eggs destroyed. 1-3. Disease and Nonbattle Injury a. General . Disease and nonbattle injuries are the major medical threat during military operations. Preventive medicine DNBI surveillance must include their effects on US, allied, coalition, and host-nation (HN) forces, and the local populace. As in war, DNBIs are the leading cause of manpower losses in stability operations and support operations. Individual, unit, and field sanitation team (FST) PMM must be stressed and applied. Preventive medicine personnel can identify the diseases and recommend control and preventive measures (see Appendix A). b. Person-to-Person. Soldiers can prevent or reduce the incidence of diseases transmitted person- to-person by observing basic PMM (including use of masks, gloves, and eye protection)ó ï When working around or with local national or refugee populations. ï When handling or exposed to human fluids or waste. ï By avoiding sneezing or coughing toward/from others. ï By sleeping head-to-toe. ï By ensuring working and living areas are well-ventilated. ï By practicing good personal hygiene (such as washing hands before eating and after using the latrine) and avoiding unprotected sex. c. Arthropodborne Disease. (1) These diseases are transmitted through the biting process of arthropods or by the physical transfer of disease-causing organisms. In endemic disease areas, the native population may appear healthy; however, they may be carriers of, or immune to, diseases that they have been exposed to repeatedly since"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"1-4 FM 4-02.17 birth. The pathogen is kept at a low level by the host immune system. This smoldering infection can be transmitted to a new host (US forces) by arthropods. Forces introduced into the AO may lack immunity from arthropodborne diseases, and if bitten, their bodyís immune system may not be prepared to prevent the disease from progressing. The result from soldiers becoming ill from arthropodborne disease includes loss of manpower which reduces the commanderís ability to execute the mission and reduces combat health support (CHS) resources to support the mission. (2) Prevention of these diseases is much more cost-effective than treatment. Personnel applying basic PMM can reduce their susceptibility to the diseases. The PMM include the use of arthropod (insect) repellents; insect netting; aerosol sprays; prophylaxis; and periodic self and buddy checks for the presence of arthropods on the body (such as ticks, lice, and fleas). Also, eliminating arthropod breeding areas (such as standing water) and access to food sources for arthropods (such as covering trash and rubbish collection areas) aids in preventing these diseases. d. Foodborne and Waterborne Diseases . (1) In areas of poor sanitation, locally procured foods present a high risk of disease for US forces. Therefore, PVNTMED personnel must work closely with the veterinary personnel that are responsible for approving locally procured foods. Food- and waterborne diseases are usually transmitted by or result fromó ï Food handlers during food preparation and serving. ï Food preparation facilities that lack adequate refrigeration for food storage. ï Inadequate or absent arthropod and rodent control. ï Animals that are permitted free access to food storage, preparation, and serving areas. ï Improperly treated or stored water. ï Contaminated or improperly treated ice. (2) Potable water for drinking and food preparation is often scarce. Deployed forces cannot be assured of the quality of local water supplies. Quartermaster water production personnel may not be available to treat water for the forces; especially in the early days of the mission. Locally purchased ice poses the same health risks as food and water. (3) The risk of food- and waterborne diseases to US forces can be minimized by command enforcement of basic PMM. ï Personnel should only eat food prepared by US military food service personnel; when not available, maximize the use of meals, ready to eat (MREs), T-Rations, or other similarly prepackaged foods. Commanders and unit leaders must be sensitive to HN customs as local hosts may consider refusal to eat their foods an insult. The risk of experiencing a foodborne illness must be weighed against the impact on relationships with HN personnel."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"1-5 FM 4-02.17 ï Personnel should only consume water that has been treated to US military standards and inspected by PVNTMED personnel. Commanders and unit leaders must ensure that personnel carry their own supply of water purification material (iodine tablets, calcium hypochlorite ampoules, or Chlor- Flocô). Bottled water does not guarantee purity; personnel should only drink US-approved and properly bottled water. Commanders and unit leaders must ensure personnel are familiar with other water purification techniques (boiling and use of bleach). Since ice from approved facilities may have been packed in contaminated materials to prevent melting, they must ensure it is inspected by PVNTMED personnel prior to consumption or use in beverages. (4) Commanders and leaders should be on the alert for possible terrorist contamination of US military water supplies. Possible targets include water treatment plants and equipment, reservoirs, storage tanks, and water distribution systems. Water supplies must be closely monitored to ensure any contamination is identified before soldiers begin presenting at medical treatment facilities with symptoms. (5) Use of local water treatment facilities may provide needed water sources for our forces. Such facilities may require supplemental treatment to meet US drinking water standards. In all cases, PVNTMED personnel must closely monitor water treatment. e. Environmental Injury/Illness . Injury and illness from heat, cold, or sudden exposure to high elevations is serious, sometimes deadly, and usually preventable. Units that are not alert to this medical threat can quickly reduce their effectiveness and ability to accomplish their mission. Commanders and unit leaders must ensure that personnel are informed of risks associated with environmental medical threats and plan for the necessary equipment and clothing. (1) Commanders and leaders can reduce the threat of heat injury by emphasizing that all personnel apply PMM. They must ensure that adequate water supplies are available and enforce a liberal water consumption policy. Further, they must ensure that all soldiers consume all meals to minimize the impact of deployment to hot areas. The standard military menu provides adequate amounts of salt to replace what is lost through sweat. Until soldiers are fully acclimatized, and when the mission permits, operations should be conducted in the cooler parts of the day to minimize the risk of heat injury. Work/rest cycles should also be used, mission permitting (see FM 21-10). (2) Commanders and leaders can minimize the threat of cold injury by ensuring personnel use PMM (dress in layers, keep dry, change socks often). Soldiers performing at low levels of activity should be reminded to increase exercise or movement (even moving toes and fingers results in increased blood circulation to the extremities). As in hot weather, soldiers must drink adequate amounts of water and consume all meals. Commanders and leaders should provide warm, well-ventilated areas for personnel to get out of the cold, mission permitting. To avoid carbon monoxide poisoning, they must ensure that personnel do not sleep in unventilated areas or in vehicles with the windows closed and the engines running. (3) Mountain and high altitude illness and injuries adds a new dimension in military operations. Commanders and leaders must be aware of the effect this environment will have on their personnel. Personnel must not be allowed to ascend to high altitudes at a rapid pace; to do so can cause acute mountain sickness and/or other more serious illnesses and injuries that will prevent the accomplishment of their mission. Acclimatization to high altitudes is based on altering the ascent rate to allow soldiers to"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"1-6 FM 4-02.17 partially acclimatize. ìGraded ascentî limits the daily altitude gain to allow partial acclimatization. The altitude at which soldiers sleep is critical. Have soldiers spend two nights at 9,000 feet and limit sleeping altitude to no more than 1,000 feet above the previous nightís sleeping altitude. When personnel begin to show the effects of high elevation, they may have to be evacuated to below 8,000 feet to recover. At very high elevations (above 14,000 feet), personnel may only be able to work for a few minutes at a time. Rest periods may have to be extended until the personnel can acclimatize to the environment. 1-4. Individual and Unit Preventive Medicine Measures The impact of the medical threat and measures taken to minimize those threats significantly affects an Armyís ability to fight and win. Forces who take the medical threat seriously gain an advantage over other forces who do not. Application of individual and unit PMM gives forces who observe and counter medical threats a strategic advantage, by minimizing losses from DNBI. For example, US forces can reduce or minimize losses fromó ï Malaria or other arthropodborne diseases by using repellents on skin and clothing and taking prescribed prophylaxis. ï Waterborne diseases by only drinking approved water or purifying water with purification materials, or boiling. ï Diarrhea and other foodborne diseases by only eating approved foods. ï Dehydration in hot or cold climates by increasing fluid (preferably water) consumption and avoiding self-dehydration (reducing fluids to minimize trips to the latrine). ï Heat injuries by ensuring personnel follow work/rest cycles, keep skin covered, and consume sufficient quantities of food and fluids. ï Cold injuries by dressing in layers and keeping dry, working and resting in warm, well- ventilated areas, and consuming sufficient quantities of food and fluids. ï High altitude illness and injuries by ascending to high elevations in a slow steady pace and observing each other for signs of mountain sickness. 1-5. Preventive Medicine Employment in Defeating the Threat The employment of PVNTMED personnel in defeating the threat is one of the least expensive means of maintaining a fighting force. When PVNTMED is employed early in the mission, fewer personnel are lost to DNBI. Once DNBIs appear, the effectiveness of the force has been compromised. However, PVNTMED personnel and FSTs can do much to reduce the impact of DNBI and other medical threats on the mission. Early PVNTMED emphasis is essential in deploying and sustaining a fit, healthy force."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"2-1 FM 4-02.17 CHAPTER 2 ROLE OF THE SOLDIER AND UNIT LEADER 2-1. General The mobility and dispersion of modern fighting forces increases the need for soldiers and their leaders to apply PMM to protect themselves against the medical threat. The application of basic PMM can reduce and, in some instances, eliminate the incidence of DNBI resulting from the medical threat. Commanders and leaders planning for and using basic PMM can rapidly achieve mission objectives by quickly and efficiently executing the mission with healthy and fit soldiers. 2-2. Role of the Individual Soldier Individual soldiers can reduce the threat of disease by applying basic PMM. These PMM include the soldier protecting himself againstó a. Heat injuries (heat cramps, heat exhaustion, or heatstroke) byó ï Following acclimatization guidance, mission permitting. ï Avoiding alcoholic and caffeinated drinks. ï Keeping physically fit. ï Avoiding medications (antidiarrheal or cold medicines), except when prescribed. ï Drinking plenty of water to replace lost body fluids through sweating; remembering that thirst is not an indicator of the bodyís need for fluids. ï Following the correct work/rest cycle (see FM 21-10). ï Eating all meals to replace lost salt. ï Keeping the skin covered and clean; rolling down the shirtsleeves; wearing full-length trousers and headgear; and wearing cotton undergarments to increase ventilation. ï Using sunblock (at least a sun protection factor [SPF] of 15) and lip balm. Apply the sunblock on all exposed skin, (face, neck, ears, and under the chin). ï Avoiding exposure to direct sunlight for long periods, mission permitting. ï Using the buddy system and seeking medical assistance if experiencing symptoms of heat injury. b.

TABLE OF ORGANIZATION AND EQUIPMENT DETACHMENTS 4-1. General a. There are two Medical Force 2000 (MF2K) PVNTMED TOE detachments in the current force structure. Their mission is to prepare and update the medical threat database, publicize the medical threat, and stimulate the employment of PMM. The detachments provide reinforcing PVNTMED services to eliminate or reduce the medical threat, whenever possible. The MF2K PVNTMED detachments areó ï Medical Detachment, PVNTMED (Sanitation) (TOE 08498L000). ï Medical Detachment, PVNTMED (Entomology) (TOE 08499L000). b. The two MF2K detachments will be replaced by a new PVNTMED detachment organized under the MRI. The MRI process designed CHS organizations to support the Force XXI Army. The MRI PVNTMED organizational changes are described in Appendix B. 4-2. Operational Principles a. Early Arrival . History strongly suggests that substantial sickness will occur among the armed forces when deployment of PVNTMED support is delayed. Breakdowns in sanitation will occur while troops are still in mobilization and debarkation assembly areas. These breakdowns in sanitation will appear as increased cases of diarrhea and other illnesses. Arthropodborne diseases may begin to emerge as a medical threat. Some illnesses will appear during the early stages of forward movement of the forces in the AO. Preventive medicine must be considered during the initial operational planning; also, emphasis must be placed on PVNTMED assistance during advance party site surveys. For units to be fully effective in protecting themselves from the medical threat, PVNTMED personnel must beó ï Included in the unitís day-to-day training while at their home station and during training exercises to keep unit personnel trained in individual PMM. ï Consulted as the units are preparing for mobilization. ï Employed in the mobilization assembly areas. ï Deployed with the first forces entering the AO. The PVNTMED detachments are tailored for early deployment to provide support to the forces. ï Employed at locations throughout the AO during the deployment. ï Redeployed with the last units/personnel exiting an AO to ensure PVNTMED support remains until all personnel have departed the AO."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"4-2 FM 4-02.17 ï Used to assist postdeployment units in their recovery from the effects of the deployment. Also, they must assist units in day-to-day preparation for future operations. b. Preemptive Action . Preventive medicine operations are most effective when they are based on preemptive threat-based actions; that is, recommending procedures that promote a healthy and fit force before the first case of illness/disease is manifested. The detachments must continually assist supported units while at the home station. The support must continue as the units prepare for deployment; move through the mobilization sites; and deploy and conduct their mission in the AO. The detachments must not wait for the incidence of diseases to appear. They must initiate action on presumptive information to reduce the medical threat early. Actions performed by PVNTMED detachments include, but are not limited toó ï Advising the unit of the medical threat in the AO. ï Ensuring that DNBI surveillance is conducted in supported units. ï Monitoring for diseases and arthropods not native to the AO (potential BW agent employment). ï Advising the commander on immunization, prophylaxis, and pretreatment requirements for the AO (AR 40-5, AR 40-562, FM 8-285, and as directed by medical authorities for AO-specific immunizations and prophylaxis). ï Ensuring that units have essential field sanitation supplies and equipment on hand (FM 21-10-1). ï Providing training for unit FSTs (FM 21-10-1). ï Providing personal hygiene and field sanitation training to unit personnel (FM 21-10). ï Providing pest management assistance to control arthropod and rodent infestations that are beyond unit capabilities. ï Assisting engineer personnel in selecting water supply sources and assisting quartermaster personnel in establishing water production points. ï Advising quartermaster water production and distribution personnel on field water treatment procedures and techniques to ensure a safe supply for US forces. ï Maintaining surveillance of field water supplies to ensure adequacy of treatment, quality, and quantity (including monitoring water supplies for possible NBC contamination).

Protecting, preserving, and documenting the collected samples while in their possession and ensuring that they are forwarded to the supporting laboratory with documented chain of custody. ï Monitoring unit food service operations to ensure adequacy of sanitation procedures."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"4-3 FM 4-02.17 ï Monitoring unit waste disposal facilities and techniques for compliance with sanitation standards (US, HN, or overseas environmental baseline guidance document). ï Monitoring unit occupational health programs and advising commanders on the application of occupational health practices and procedures. ï Providing retrograde cargo inspections, as required. c. Priority to Combat Elements . Tactical dispersion places combat elements largely on their own for PVNTMED self-protection; however, there are opportunities for PVNTMED detachments to provide support in these situations. The detachments must seek out such opportunities and give priority to the combat elements. The detachments can do much for dispersed combat units by ensuring that water supplies and food service operations are safe; this helps to ensure that the force is ready to perform their mission. d. Decentralized Command and Control . Initially PVNTMED detachments are assigned to an ASMB, medical group, medical brigade, or medical command. As missions for detachments require their employment in specific roles, they may be attached to other medical units. Preventive medicine detachments provide the most responsive support when they work directly with units at the greatest risk. The preferred support relationship is attachment; direct support is the next best; and general support is employed when the situation is too unclear to establish realistic priorities within the AO. The exact command relationship is dependent on mission, enemy, terrain, troops, and time available. 4-3. Operational Concept for the Preventive Medicine Detachment (Sanitation) This detachment provides PVNTMED support and consultation to minimize the effects of occupational hazards; enteric diseases; arthropod-, food-, and waterborne diseases; and other medical threats on deployed forces includingó ï Field sanitation and personal hygiene. ï Sanitary engineering. ï Disease surveillance. ï Occupational health. ï Health promotion. ï Limited entomology. ï Limited pest management. ï Limited ground pesticide spraying."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"4-4 FM 4-02.17 4-4. Location of the Preventive Medicine Detachment (Sanitation) Normally, the detachment is deployed to specific areas in the corps or EAC.

Operational Concept for the Preventive Medicine Detachment (Entomology) This detachment provides PVNTMED support and consultation to minimize the effects of arthropod-, food-, and waterborne diseases; environmental injuries; enteric diseases; and other health threats on deployed"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"4-7 FM 4-02.17 forces. The detachment provides pest management direct support to units and general support on an area support basis. Pest management support is provided using both aerial spray (see Appendix C) and ground spray equipment. The PVNTMED support and consultation includesó ï Entomology. ï Aerial and ground pesticide spraying. ï Pest management. ï Disease surveillance. ï Field sanitation and personal hygiene. ï Health promotion. ï Occupational health. 4-7. Location of the Preventive Medicine Detachment (Entomology) The detachment normally deploys near potential pest infestations to identify and apply control measures before the pest can affect the health of US forces. They may be located anywhere within the corps or EAC. a. When providing direct support to a specific unit in the corps or EAC, the detachment collocates with the supported unit. b. When attached to a division to provide aerial spray missions, the detachment generally locates near a divisional airfield. The airfield serves as an excellent source of real-time information on weather conditions, the availability of rotary-wing aircraft, and the tactical situation. All three elements are essential when conducting aerial spray operations. Proximity to the airfield also minimizes nonproductive shuttle time for the aircraft concerned. Since these airfields are located in the division support areas, the detachment can also meet its surveillance and ground spray mission responsibilities with minimal travel. All detachment activities conducted in the division area are coordinated with the PVNTMED section of the main support medical company. This coordination ensures continuity of support to the divisional units. c. Attachment and direct support missions are usually for limited periods of time. Therefore, the detachment relocates frequently as problems are resolved and the medical threat changes. d. When providing general support to units in the corps or EAC, the detachment generally collocates with another medical unit on a temporary basis with the supported unit until the task is done or the mission priorities shift. The precise location is dependent upon time required for travel, type of terrain, and the medical threat."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"4-8 FM 4-02.17 e. The detachment is dependent upon the unit to which it is attached or in support of for the following: ï Food service. ï Religious support. ï Legal services. ï Combat health support. ï Finance services. ï Personnel and administrative support. ï Bath and laundry service. ï Clothing exchange. ï Unit maintenance. ï Communications maintenance. ï Resupply of all classes of supply. 4-8. Function of the Preventive Medicine Detachment (Entomology) The detachment employs a combination of aerial and ground spray equipment to suppress arthropods. It applies measures to control rodents. The detachment may function as a single operational activity or may split into a headquarters section and two teams to provide support to a greater number of units. When the two teams are operating in the split team configuration, they must maintain contact with the detachment headquarters section. In preparation for deployment, during deployment, and postdeployment, the detachment performs the following support functions (many of these functions are also performed during training exercises): a. Predeployment . ï Obtain medical threat information, including medical intelligence reports, medical surveillance products, and briefings. Provide commanders and leaders predeployment information related to medical screening, immunizations, and prophylaxis and recommend packing lists to counter the medical threat. ï Brief supported unit commanders, leaders, and soldiers on the medical threat."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"4-9 FM 4-02.17 ï Assist supported unit commanders and leaders to ensure that their personnel have required immunizations, prophylaxis, pretreatment, dental care, and other medical needs completed. b.

Basis of Allocation a. The basis of allocation for the PVNTMED detachment (sanitation) is one per 28,000 personnel and one per 50,000 prisoners of war. Rule of thumb: Two per division supported. b. The basis of allocation for the PVNTMED detachment (entomology) is one per 66,000 personnel and one per 100,000 prisoners of war. Rule of thumb: One per division supported. 4-10. Mobility The strategic deployability for each PVNTMED detachment is 100 percent mobile. See Appendix H for deployment data. 4-11. Standing Operating Procedures, Checklists, and Movement Plans Every unit must have SOPs, checklists, and movement plans prepared. An SOP must be prepared for many activities in a unit; for example, an SOP for classified document security is prepared to ensure that everyone handling classified documents understands the commanderís intent and requirements. The SOP specifies who has the authority to receive, review, safeguard, and destroy these documents. Many activities related to unit movement must be conducted far in advance of the actual movement date; these activities are controlled through SOPs and checklists. As a specific action is accomplished, it can be recorded on a checklist, thus ensuring that others are aware that the action is completed. The use of SOPs and checklists also ensure that the unit is prepared for its designated support mission. The SOPs and checklists let members of the unit know what needs to be done and when, where, and how it must be done. All TOE equipment must be on hand and in a serviceable condition. Special equipment, organizational clothing, and required repair parts must be on hand. Essential common table of allowances (CTA) items must be on hand and in a serviceable condition. Personnel records, immunizations, and family support plans must be up to date. Appendix A provides sample formats for the PVNTMED estimate and plan. Appendix D provides a sample commanderís checklist for mobilization. Appendix E provides information on conducting an entomological survey. Appendix F provides a sample checklist for conducting a PVNTMED site survey. Appendix G provides a training procedures guide. Section II. TABLES OF DISTRIBUTION AND ALLOWANCES ACTIVITIES 4-12. General The mission of PVNTMED TDA activities is to prepare and update the medical threat database, publicize the medical threat, and stimulate the employment of PMM. The TDA activities provide reinforcing PVNTMED services to eliminate or reduce the medical threat, whenever possible. The PVNTMED TDA activities are located within the sustaining base and in locations outside the continental United States (CONUS). The TDA activities provide day-to-day PVNTMED support to military installations.

General The PVNTMED commander is responsible for the readiness of his detachment for deployment. He must be prepared to deploy the unit from CONUS to an overseas area, from an overseas area to the CONUS, or between major commands. This chapter contains guidance for the preparation and execution of unit movement plans. When preparing a detailed movement plan, refer to AR 55-113, AR 220-10, FM 55-65, FM 100-17, and all pertinent local directives. 5-2. Planning Planning for unit movement is continuous. It begins with the unitís first day of activation, continues during preparation for the move, and goes on until the move is completed. The commander reviews existing movement plans, SOPs, and loading plans for completeness and correctness. If the unit is newly activated or has no developed plans, the commander MUST prepare movement plans, including SOPs and loading plans. Specific actions are detailed in the planning checklist at Appendix D. 5-3. Warning Order The first indication that a unit will move may be the receipt of a warning order establishing the personnel shipment readiness data (PSRD). Receipt of this order prompts several actions. The unit begins preliminary preparation for the move. The major Army commander gaining the unit furnishes preparation for overseas movement information to the losing major Army commander. The losing commander distributes required planning and equipment information to the affected units. Preparation for overseas movement information normally includesó ï The unitís new mailing address. ï A listing of authorized (TOE and CTA) items that need not be shipped with the unit. ï Additional items that the overseas commander desires to have shipped with the unit. ï Special clothing for the deployment area. ï Authorized stockage lists. ï Authorized prescribed load list. ï Expendable supply requirements. Additional actions to be taken by a unit commander on receipt of a warning order are shown in Appendix D."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"5-2 FM 4-02.17 5-4. Movement Directive and Movement Order The movement directive is the authority for unit movement and is the basis for actions by all agencies concerned with the move. It is usually issued 90 days before the deploying unitís PSRD. Based on this directive, the installation or activity issues a movement order for the deploying unit. This order implements the movement directive and provides additional instructions needed to prepare the unit for movement. Any TOE modification is included in the movement order, along with a listing of equipment to be issued at the port of embarkation or in country, if applicable. Actions required on receipt of the movement order are outlined in Appendix D. 5-5. Unit Movement Plans These plans contain up-to-date logistical data summarizing transportation requirements, priorities, and limitations that affect the unitís movement. Movement may be by highway, water, rail, or air. Contents of a movement plan may vary with the unitís contingency status, guidance from higher headquarters, and the effort the unit commander puts into preparing the plan. As a minimum, the unit movement plan should contain the following elements: a . Detailed listing of personal baggage, organizational equipment, expendable supplies, and nonexpendable supplies. b . The organization for movement, including the procedure for movement of the staff and advance party, if applicable. c . Procedures to be followed at home station, en route, and at destination. d . Unit load plans (see paragraph 5-7). 5-6. Standing Operating Procedures for Unit Move Details relating to a unit move are included in unit SOPs. These SOPs may include such things as duties of an advance party; convoy security; and deployment procedures at destination. Although minor changes in SOPs may be required, basic procedures should vary little from movement to movement. Preparation of an SOP covering the details of unit movements relieves the commander of having to repeatedly plan and issue directives for operations that follow established patterns. 5-7. Unit Load Plans Unit load plans are documents that present detailed instructions for hauling all unit personnel and equipment. To ensure effective and expeditious movement of unit personnel and equipment, load plans should be kept current. Load plans are based on TOE-authorized personnel (with their personal baggage), equipment,"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"5-3 FM 4-02.17 vehicle onboard equipment (including camouflage netting), and CTA items. Load plans are prepared and maintained in each unit in anticipation of movement by the various transportation modes. a. Unit Load Inventory and Checklist . This is prepared for each category of equipment, such as vehicles, CTA items, and PVNTMED medical equipment sets. It is a numerical list of all containers and vehicles to be shipped. b. Unit Vehicle Load Plan . The vehicle load plan is used to move unit equipment, personnel, and supplies with organic transportation. It lists the personnel, equipment, and supplies to be transported in organic vehicles. Common table of allowances equipment is limited to that which is essential for mission completion. Applicable CTAs that may be used are 8-100; 50-900; 50-909; and 50-970. c. Unit Train Load Plan . This plan is used when the unit moves by rail. It shows the proposed distribution of personnel and equipment based on the rail cars tentatively available for the unit. It may require adjustments when an actual move is made and specific rail cars are assigned. d. Unit Air Load Plan . This plan is used when the unit moves by air. A separate plan for each type of aircraft must be made. It covers the type of cargo to be loaded in each aircraft, loading start time, estimated time required to load, special equipment requirements, and other data pertaining to the specific aircraft. e. Unit Estimate of Aircraft Required . This is used to determine the number and type of aircraft required to airlift a unitís personnel and equipment. f. Unit Vessel Loading Plan . This plan is used when the unit moves by watercraft or ship. (See Appendix H.)"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"6-1 FM 4-02.17 CHAPTER 6 PREVENTIVE MEDICINE SERVICES IN STABILITY OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT OPERATIONS 6-1. General The role of PVNTMED in stability operations and support operations encompasses a wide range of support activities. Preventive medicine personnel will have much closer contact with the local populace. In most stability operations and support operations, the primary mission of PVNTMED is to support US, allied, and coalition forces; they may provide limited support to HN civilians. However, in domestic support, the PVNTMED mission is to provide assistance to civilians affected by disaster. Preventive medicine is not the lead agency; any PVNTMED support provided to civilians must be preapproved by DA, the ASCC commander, or the task force commander. The PVNTMED staff may be from TDA or TOE organizations. Personnel assigned to TDA activities will find their role greatly increased in support of many stability operations and support operations. Personnel assigned to TDA organizations will be called upon to assist units during their preparation for stability operations and support operations, and in some situations, to continue this support during the mission. During preparation for stability operations and support operations, supported units will require PVNTMED support as if they were preparing for a war; however, they may have to provide for themselves or rely on the HN for housing, water supplies, and waste disposal support. Therefore, PVNTMED personnel must be actively involved in all phases of their preparation for the mission and during the mission. See FM 8-42 for detailed information on CHS in stability operations and support operations. 6-2. Domestic Support Domestic support operations are normally conducted under the authority of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). At the request of FEMA, the DOD may direct Army units and personnel (including PVNTMED) to assist in the operation. When deployed in support of such missions, PVNTMED personnel will NOT assume the primary role of providing public health support. Instead, they will assist FEMA and local or state health authorities as directed by the Army command and control (C2) organization. a. Initial Actions. Upon arrival in the disaster area, PVNTMED personnel establish contact with the Army C2 organization for instructions on their mission. After receiving their initial instructions, PVNTMED personnel should determineó ï Where they are to be headquartered. ï What FEMA and the health authorities have identified as the medical threat in relationship to the disaster. Based upon the identified medical threat, PVNTMED personnel establish priorities for PVNTMED support. b. Information Flow . Preventive medicine personnel establish procedures for acquiring early access to local information of PVNTMED concern. The information flow at a minimum should beó ï From the PVNTMED support element and staff through the chain of command to FEMA and the health authorities."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"6-2 FM 4-02.17 ï From FEMA and the health authorities down through the chain of command to the PVNTMED staff. ï Between other supporting agencies and the PVNTMED staff. ï Information pertaining to engineering support, for example, should also be provided to the PVNTMED staff. This information is important in the PVNTMED decision-making process, especially in determining the best recommendations for provision of sanitation facilities, safe water supplies, and food service sources. EXAMPLE: The supporting engineers may know that the local water supply system is functioning in one area of the disaster area, but not in other areas. This information will assist PVNTMED personnel in making recommendations on how to provide safe water in all areas. If water is safe in one area, then transport of this water to unsafe areas can be employed, rather than having to rely on trying to disinfect water at the user level. c. Life Support. Life support services are not a direct responsibility of PVNTMED personnel. However, such services are of considerable interest because of their impact on the health of the disrupted community. Preventive medicine personnel can assist local authorities in these services by providing technical advice onó ï The adequacy of expedient shelters such as schools, churches, warehouses, and other structures which survived the devastation. If tent villages are necessary, they provide advice on the configuration of the communities and the adequacy of available tentage. ï The adequacy of food service facilities, water supplies, waste disposal, personal hygiene, and laundry facilities. d. Emergency Supplies . Preventive medicine personnel assist with the identification of emergency supplies needed by the disrupted community. The supplies may includeó ï Clothing and blankets. ï Cooking utensils. ï Supplies to treat drinking water. If bulk chlorine is provided, measuring devices and instructions on its use must also be included. ï Chemicals for use in improvised portable toilets. Chemical toilets may be constructed by using scrap lumber, canvas or tarpaulins, and buckets. The chemicals are added to the buckets for odor control and to begin waste decomposition. e. Water . Technical advice on the adequacy of the water supply to the disrupted community, including advice on cleaning or rejecting contaminated wells and water distribution systems, is provided by PVNTMED personnel. Attention is focused onó ï Restoration of wells and water distribution systems. Even if only limited portions of a distribution system are restored, the restored system can make providing a safe water supply much easier."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"6-3 FM 4-02.17 ï Acquisition of other sources until restoration efforts can be completed. ï Transportation of water from those sources. ï Management of distribution points. ï Quality of the water as it impacts on the individual consumer. f. Food . Preventive medicine personnel provide technical advice concerning the adequacy of food supplies for the disrupted community. Attention is focused on sanitation, to include storage, preparation, and distribution of available food. They help local authorities evaluate food stocks (when veterinary personnel are not available) in the disrupted area with emphasis on salvage, when possible. 6-3. Protection Against Epidemic Diseases Disaster situations often overwhelm the capabilities of local public health agencies. Local public health agencies may not be fully aware of diseases being introduced into their area by refugees or multinational forces. The PVNTMED mission may include assisting public health officials in identifying diseases and recommending or providing measures to reduce the incidence of disease. Ways in which PVNTMED personnel can assist may includeó a. Suppression of Arthropod Vectors . They provide technical advice concerning the suppression of mosquitoes, flies, lice, other arthropods, animals, and rodents. With the concurrence of local authorities, they may conduct limited pest management operations to reinforce local efforts. b. Investigation of Disease Outbreaks. Preventive medicine personnel assist local authorities by investigating reported disease outbreaks. Their findings are used to dispel rumors or to provide early warning for local action if the threat is confirmed. c. Immunizations and Prophylaxis . Although mass immunization operations are seldom warranted, PVNTMED personnel must be prepared to assist local health authorities if called upon to do so. Provisions for prophylaxis, such as malaria pills, may be required to counter some diseases. d. Control of Human Waste . Lack of human waste control can lead to a number of disease outbreaks. Simple control procedures can prevent their occurrence. Improvised waste disposal devices can be prepared for use until standard sanitary facilities can be restored. Preventive medicine personnel can provide advice on the construction and maintenance of these devices. The use of chemical toilets or burnout latrines can greatly reduce the health hazard from inadequate control of human waste. e. Recovery from Disruption. Return to normal or near-normal living conditions is the central motivation of all individuals who are displaced by a disaster. Before individuals are allowed to return home, several important tasks must be considered. Preventive medicine personnel provide technical advice on theó ï Clearance of debris from drainage structures. Badly damaged homes represent a major debris removal problem, but the basis for condemnation is structural (not health) and such decisions are left to local authorities."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"6-4 FM 4-02.17 ï Collection and disposal of animal carcasses. ï Collection and disposal of food that has been condemned by local authority. f. Preparation of Homes for Reoccupancy . Preventive medicine personnel provide technical advice on cleaning, disinfecting, and spraying homes that were affected by the disaster. Contact surfaces (such as tabletops, countertops, and cooking and eating utensils) are of primary concern because of their potential for vectoring enteric diseases carried by water. Also, provisions are made for refrigeration units or ice chests with ice to protect perishable food from extended exposure to temperatures at which organisms can grow. Perishable food should be stored at temperatures below 45∞F. 6-4. Humanitarian Assistance During humanitarian assistance operations, PVNTMED personnel may provide assistance in restoring public health services. The assistance may include, but not be limited to, the areas of food sanitation, entomology, epidemiology, occupational health, housing, water treatment, and waste disposal. Preventive medicine personnel will provide this assistance as directed by the lead agency for the operation. They will not volunteer to provide any services outside of those areas to which they are assigned a mission. Any assistance provided must be coordinated with local public health officials. This coordination will help the local public health officials maintain the services upon the departure of PVNTMED personnel. The PVNTMED personnel should not perform the actual activities of restoring public health services; their role should be to provide guidance to the public health officials and the local populace. This does not mean that in the absence of individuals to perform the restoration activities that PVNTMED personnel cannot start the restoration process. 6-5. Peacekeeping/Peace Enforcement As in war, PVNTMED support during peacekeeping and peace enforcement operations will comprise all activities with an increased surveillance for occupational exposure to numerous industrial chemical, biological, and radiological hazards. EXAMPLE: Troops may be housed near steel foundries; these facilities may have high levels of components such as lead, chromium, zinc, cyanides, and radiation. The exposure levels may be so low that limited immediate effects do not manifest in the troops; however, the long-term effects could be serious. Preventive medicine personnel must closely monitor areas habitually occupied by US forces for such exposures. Local water supplies may have to be used by US forces; these supplies may not meet US standards and will require supplemental chlorination before use. 6-6. Environmental Health and Environment Surveillance Preventive medicine personnel conducting environmental health surveillance in stability operations and support operations may use several techniques to verify the presence or absence of industrial chemicals in the environment. In Bosnia, the M93 Series NBC Reconnaissance Vehicle System (FOX) was used to collect air samples for industrial waste vapor surveillance. When used for this mission, the FOX employed the industrial surveillance equipment; in its chemical agent surveillance mode, it does not have the correct sample collecting supplies."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"7-1 FM 4-02.17 CHAPTER 7 PREVENTIVE MEDICINE IN SUPPORT OF CIVIL-MILITARY OPERATIONS 7-1. Mission Winning indigenous population support is an important facet of military operations. Civil-military operations are an important part of that effort. As part of CMO, PVNTMED can make a significant contribution to this support. Preventive medicine support may be provided by personnel organic to the CMO organization or may be provided by TDA and TOE personnel and units. 7-2. Command Approval Any PVNTMED participation in CMO is first coordinated with the C2 authority, then with the agencies designated by that headquarters to conduct the project. Command approval is required when substantial resources are involved. Command approval is also important from the standpoint of HN agreements, which could be violated by well-intentioned efforts. 7-3. Purpose The dominant theme in the design of a CMO project is ìlocal sufficiency.î The community must have the aptitude and resources to sustain the project after US forces leave, or the whole effort is for naught. Other constraints include local customs and taboos; some are so grounded in culture that to challenge them will result in a loss of credibility rather than winning support. 7-4. Preventive Medicine Projects There are a variety of projects that PVNTMED elements can undertake to win the support of the local populace. However, all projects undertaken should be designed to make lasting improvements in the communityís overall health. Emphasis is placed on training the community in self-sufficiency to conduct such services. If equipment or materiel is involved, the training must include procedures for procuring the equipment or materiel and repair parts; repair parts must be readily available in the region. Equipment from a distant country will be of little value to a community unless the repair parts are also provided; in many instances, the high cost for repair parts will create problems that the community cannot handle. Many communities are so poor that they cannot afford even the basic items. Projects that may be undertaken include actions or activities such asó ï Health screening to identify endemic diseases with recommendations on how the people can counter the effects of the disease. ï Health education on how the people can reduce disease and illness risk. ï Immunization programs to reduce the spread of diseases."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"7-2 FM 4-02.17 ï Projects to upgrade or improve the local water supply and waste disposal facilities. If the improvement to the water supply system includes installation of power-driven pumps, training must include maintenance and repair parts procurement procedures (if repair parts are not provided with the pump). Installing a pump system without training the people on maintaining the pump, including repair parts procurement, will not be an improvement; it will be an additional problem. 7-5. Health Screenings When conducting health screenings, PVNTMED personnel must ensure that the local population understands actions taken are to aid in improving their health and well-being. Preventive medicine personneló ï Collect only those human specimens necessary to evaluate suspect diseases in the area such as malaria, hepatitis, dysentery, and intestinal parasites. ï Evaluate the prevalence of skin diseases and body lice among the population. ï Evaluate the nutritional status of the population, to include daily dietary intake of vitamins, minerals, fats, proteins, fibers, and carbohydrates. ï Provide guidance to the local population on how they may improve their health by applying basic procedures to prevent disease and how to improve their nutritional intake with the available food sources. 7-6. Health Education Health education must be taught at the educational level of the population. All classes should be short in duration; interactive, hands-on, if possible; and directed toward achievable goals. Simple procedures, such as washing their hands after using the bathroom or before eating, are much more effective than trying to explain the process by which diseases are spread. Explain that burying human waste can prevent flies from spreading diseases to food, rather than how flies pick up disease organisms and deposit them on the food."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"8-1 FM 4-02.17 CHAPTER 8 PREVENTIVE MEDICINE REPORTS 8-1. General Reports are documents provided to leaders and commanders that record PVNTMED support. The reports give immediate feedback to leadership on medical threat findings; the medical threat may adversely affect a unitís ability to perform its assigned mission. Included in the reports are recommendations for the commander to use in countering the medical threat. Reports also serve as a historical account of medical threat effects on a force during the conduct of operations. 8-2.

Introduction Medical surveillance (MEDSURV) is the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of data essential to the planning, implementation, and evaluation of military force health. The determination of unit-specific rates of illness and injuries of public health significance is the foundation of the MEDSURV program. Medical surveillance is closely integrated with the timely dissemination of these data to those responsible for prevention and control of DNBI. Implementing guidance for DOD is found in DOD Instruction 6490.3. The establishment of uniform and standardized health surveillance and readiness procedures for all deployments are listed in Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) Memorandum MCM-251-98. Deployment mental health screening will be addressed in separate policy memorandums. 9-2. Applicability and Scope The DOD Instruction mentioned above applies to the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the military departments, the CJCS, the combatant commands, the Defense agencies and the DOD field activities. The term military service refers to the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and the Marine Corps. When the Coast Guard is operating as a military service in the Navy, it will be included in the military MEDSURV system. a . Preventive medicine assets, both TOE and garrison, monitor DNBI in the force in order to identify and reduce incidents and to identify and counter medical threats. b . Medical surveillance teams provide timely reports to commanders, medical clinicians, planners, and others who require this information in a timely manner. This information and analysis provides decision support to commanders, so that the commanders have an understanding of the potential combat effectiveness of their units before, during and after operational deployments. c. Medical surveillance forms a basis for medical resource allocations, refines knowledge of the medical threat, and permits continual assessment of the effectiveness of measures used to prevent and control DNBI. d . The term medical surveillance as used here is different than its meaning in occupational medicine; occupational medical surveillance is the monitoring applied to individual workers based on actual or presumed workplace exposures. 9-3. Mission Objective of Medical Surveillance The mission objective of the AMEDD, to conserve the fighting strength, mirrors PVNTMEDís mission objective for MEDSURV: to protect the health of the force . Together they improve soldier performance and unit effectiveness, minimizing the demand for a more logistically intensive health restoration capability. The PVNTMED functions include assessing the medical threat, identifying and recommending PMM, and conducting surveillance. The traditional yardstick of deployed force health is the DNBI rate. The primary"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"9-2 FM 4-02.17 mission objective is to deploy a healthy force having a DNBI rate equal to, or less than, the average DNBI rate for the nondeployed force. a . Predeployment PVNTMED assets determine the baseline readiness of the force by conducting predeployment health screening assessments. These assessments are documented on standardized forms for inclusion in individual medical records. b . Once in theater, the PVNTMEDís mission objective is to sustain the health of the force in the field. Soldier performance equals soldier health and fitness being sustained for the duration of the deployment. The medical threat is not limited to infectious disease, nor is the medical threat any less dynamic than the enemy threat. Preventive medicine assets provide troop commanders with appropriate information on troop health status, illness and disease threat analyses, and redeployment health concerns. c . Finally, during the postdeployment phase of operations, PVNTMEDís MEDSURV will continuously monitor the health status of the force just as judiciously as organizational equipment and training status are monitored. As was done during predeployment activities, a postdeployment health assessment will be conducted. Together, these health assessmentsó (1) Define the rates and trends of DNBI in the force. (2) Provide commanders an accurate description of the health status of their force. (3) Validate new or continuing preventive and curative medicine needs for the force. (4) Contribute to the ongoing determination of the medical threat. 9-4. Principles of Medical Surveillance Several controlling principles govern MEDSURV. These state that MEDSURV isó ï Useful . The information collected and reported is directly applicable to the commanderís critical information requirements, prevention of DNBI, and to ongoing appreciation of the medical threat in the AO. The MEDSURV information is always immediately applied to PVNTMED activities. It prompts immediate corrective action for identified DNBI, but more importantly, it is applied to adjust PMM. For example, a dramatic increase in the rate of acute diarrhea among the troops in one or several units may be a sign of contaminated food or water in the affected units, warranting additional investigation. An increase in the rate of nonbattle injuries in a unit will prompt an investigation that results in reinforcement of control measures and proper use of protective equipment. Thus, MEDSURV contributes to prevention and serves as a force multiplier. ï Systematic . Medical surveillance is executed throughout the force by the same methods. Transmission of the information collected is uniform in method and schedule. Reporting of the interpreted information is clear, predictable, and coordinated with OPLANs and concerns."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"9-3 FM 4-02.17 ï Timely . Information collected loses value rapidly. It must be transmitted up the chain of command and medical chains efficiently. Integrating reports must be similarly disseminated back down the chain of command. ï Tailorable . Medical surveillance can be focused to reflect the intensity of specific elements of the medical threat to the force. For example, dermatological conditions may be highlighted in data collected within the force deployed to a location with a high prevalence of skin disease or continuous exposure to high humidity or water that threatens combat effectiveness. ï Interconnected . Medical surveillance exploits the communications and network capabilities of the theater and the sustaining base to rapidly disseminate its data and reporting results throughout the CHS system. Using analog and digital media, and employing legacy and emerging systems, MEDSURV results are communicated and applied to PMM selection and employment at all levels of the deployed force. ï Simple . The flow of information is direct and clear. The elements of information collected are sparse and concise. ï Acceptable . The burden on the soldier, leader, and unit is light. The tasks of MEDSURV are embedded in the tasks of the CHS system. The reports generated support the mission and planning needs of the receivers. ï Sensitive, Predictive, and Representative . The means of collection must be sensitive to ensure elements of the DNBI are not overlooked. The information gathering structure/process must allow for rapid interpretations of data to provide the commander with timely and factual information on DNBI prevention. 9-5. Responsibilities for Medical Surveillance The responsibilities for MEDSURV are shared by the individual soldier, unit leaders, senior commanders, and the CHS system. a. Unit leaders and commandersó ï Inform troops of illness, injury, and disease threats, the risks associated with those threats, and the countermeasures in place, or to be used, to minimize those risks while deployed. ï Ensure compliance with PVNTMED guidance. ï Promote combat stress control programs and policies. ï Ensure completion of pre- and postdeployment health assessments. b . Senior commandersó ï Support MEDSURV within their units and by their CHS personnel with appropriate planning, resources, policy, enforcement, education, and training."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"9-4 FM 4-02.17 ï Use MEDSURV information as the basis for unit health reporting and in all phases of planning. ï Report unit DNBI rates and health readiness in accordance with joint guidance (see CJCS Memorandum, MCM-251-98), service policy, OPORD, and OPLAN. ï Provide unit personnel strength figures to supporting medical units for calculation of unit-specific MEDSURV rates and trends. ï Consolidate MEDSURV report information from subordinate units in determining health status and medical threat. For example, the brigade will incorporate reports from subordinate battalions and separate companies; the division will use brigade reports, and so forth. ï Ensure that soldiers complete pre- and postdeployment survey forms and other requirements in accordance with joint guidance. (See DOD Directive 6490.2.) c . Medical commanders and officers in chargeó (1) Ensure that each case of DNBI that is defined as a reportable event is reported through command channels to the appropriate MEDSURV activity (such as CHPPM, AFMIC, Defense Medical Surveillance System). ( a ) In garrison and on fixed installations, reporting is routed through the PVNTMED service of the MTF. ( b ) In theater, reports are routed through senior medical channels to the appropriate MEDSURV activity. (2) Assist in preparation of weekly DNBI reports for supported units by recording returned to duty and admission to Echelons III-V facilities in accordance with joint guidance. d . Preventive medicine officersó (1) Assist surgeons in tabulating, interpreting, and reporting MEDSURV data. (2) Provide technical assistance to supported units and staffs in deriving and applying MEDSURV data. (3) Maintain oversight of MEDSURV reporting in supported units."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"APPENDIX A PLANNING/PREPARATIONS FOR PREVENTIVE MEDICINE IN MILITARY OPERATIONS Section I. GENERAL PLANNING INFORMATION A-1. General The precursor in all military operations must be planning. Plans must be clear. They must explain how and why forces are employed, what forces are to be deployed, and when . Ultimately, the plan that is developed must stand up to the strongest scrutinyóexecution. All plans must be prudent and relevant to current and projected threats. The PVNTMED plans must keep deployed forces in the most vigorous health possible wherever and whenever they are employed. This appendix will assist task force commanders and their staffs in understanding the complexity and the necessity of PVNTMED to their overall plan. a. Joint Military Missions. In todayís world, the Services will not fight or deploy alone. Each of the Services will have a part in all military missions of the US no matter how small or large. Joint medical planning must be done with the knowledge and awareness of each Serviceís capabilities in any given situation. The mission of PVNTMED is to counter the health threat. b. Common Problems in Planning for Preventive Medicine During Military Operations. The CHS planner must use professional judgment and common sense to omit nonapplicable portions of the PVNTMED estimates and plans. Planning is ongoing and the planner will need to adjust certain elements of the PVNTMED plan to stay current with the development of a military operation. The planner may expand certain areas of the plan that require more detailed information in subsequent phases of the operation or may have to redirect PVNTMED emphasis in other areas. The plannerís job is never over. (1) One of the common problems in planning for PVNTMED during ongoing operations is that the perspective of the MEDCOM PVNTMED officer, the ASMB PVNTMED officer and the divisional PVNTMED officer are different. These perspectives can be vastly different from one another and each planner has different aspects to consider when preparing estimates and plans and submitting them to the CHS planner. The best way to alleviate this potential problem is to maintain communication with all associated planners during the ongoing planning process. (2) Another problem that the PVNTMED planner may have is many of the tasks for the PVNTMED detachments are implied and not clearly stated in any of the plans. The PVNTMED planner must guard against assuming that the PVNTMED detachments will know what was intended by the commander/PVNTMED planner in vague and poorly worded plans. (3) Always a constant concern for the PVNTMED planner is the frequently changing mission statement. The planner must guard against misinterpreting the changes to the CHS mission statement when revamping/updating the PVNTMED plan. (4) The PVNTMED planner must stay abreast of all medical intelligence information that is applicable to PVNTMED. Medical intelligence is obtained from sources listed in the medical intelligence A-1 FM 4-02.17"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"annex to the CHS plan. The most common problem comes as the theater or operation develops and current medical intelligence is not brought up to date to reflect the current situation. Digitization will help alleviate that problem to a certain degree, but it will not totally do away with the PVNTMED planner being caught in a data/information vacuum during critical times of an operation or during planning sessions. There is little a planner can do about the situation but he must be aware that the problem exists and be prepared to deal with the fact when it occurs. c. Preventive Medicine Versus Patient Care and Management. Often, the problem occurs because each piece is so important to the success of the mission. The one principle that must be remembered is that the medical footprint must always be constrained. Many of the problems that occur can be averted if the following items are dealt with at the outset: ï Define the health threat. ï Identify the threat assessment factors. ï Communicate the health threat. ï Include PVNTMED in the OPLAN. ï Understand that planners are staff members, not commanders. ï Read the OPLAN/OPORD. ï Stovepipe to Service surgeon generals. ï Understand the difference between executing and planning. ï Address the necessary PVNTMED skills among the force. A-2. Facts and Assumptions During this phase of the planning process, the force surgeon usually attends the facts and assumption meetings. If possible, the PVNTMED planner should try to attend these meetings also. a. The PVNTMED planner should develop personal working relationships with the o perations staff officer, G3/J3/S3; the personnel staff officer, G1/J1/S1 and the intelligence officer, G2/J 2/S2. To a lesser degree, the PVNTMED planner needs to be able to work with the logistics staff officer, G4/J4/S4 and the overall planning cell, the G5/J5/S5; and the communications staff officer, the G6/J6/S6. b. In joint operations, the J3 operations staff officer has the information that will allow the PVNTMED planner to formulate many of the PVNTMED facts and assumptions. The PVNTMED planner must be proactive; from the J3, the following information is attainable: ï Mission and commanderís intent (one or two levels up). A-2 FM 4-02.17"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"ï Current task organization (two levels down). ï Current unit status. ï Unit locations. ï Unit combat capabilities. ï Unit activities. ï Other Servicesí CHS. ï Other unit information. ï Area NBC exposure status. ï Time of exposure. c. From the J2, the intelligence staff officer, the PVNTMED planning officer can obtain the following: ï Battlefield analysis (not usually considered, but should be, is whether blood and blood products will be necessary in the theater). ï Terrain analysis (surface water; need to purify water or use bottled water). ï Current weather status. ï Known enemy status. d. The PVNTMED planner needs to develop relationships with the J1/G1 in order to obtain information regarding the following: ï Personnel readiness. ï Unit strength, maintenance, and replacements. ï Service support/noncombat matters. ï Organizational climate. ï Commitment/cohesion. e. From the logistics staff officer, the J4, the following facts and assumptions can be found: ï Maintenance. A-3 FM 4-02.17"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"ï Supply/services. ï Transportation. ï Labor. ï Facilities and construction. ï Airspace for medical supplies and personnel. ï Contracting support. f. The planning staff officer, J5, has access to the following information: ï Civil Affairs unit locations and capabilities. ï Local government support availability. ï Constraints or restrictions. ï Area intelligence information. A-3. Mission Analysis Once the facts and assumptions have been collected, the PVNTMED planner moves to the third phase of the appendix development process. The nature of the second phase makes it important to continually update the facts and assumptions as the operation develops. Facts that may have been important initially may move to the background, and assumptions may prove to be false or less important. The reverse of those instances can also occur and the planner must stay on top of all situations. a. The PVNTMED planner develops a mission analysis from the data collected during the fact- finding portion of the planning process. The planner then develops the PVNTMED estimate of the mission. The planner lists any critical assumptions or commanderís requirements applicable to the operation. b. The planner describes, in general terms, how the medical support system addresses the infectious disease, vectorborne disease, sanitation, and environmental threats prevalent throughout the AO. He outlines what types of PVNTMED resources will be introduced early in the development process to institute basic measures and describes how the overall PVNTMED capabilities will be phased into and positioned throughout the theater. The planner identifies tasks to be performed, specified, and implied. c. The planner describes the medical intelligence used to develop this appendix and outlines how medical intelligence is gathered, processed, and disseminated to the deployed and deploying units. The planning staff lists the assets available, the essential tasks that must be accomplished, the acceptable levels of risk, constraints, restrictions, and the initial time analysis. A-4 FM 4-02.17"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"d. During development of the PVNTMED planning stages for an operation, a mission analysis is necessary. The commanderís intent has been clarified, the tasks to be performed (specified and implied) have been identified. The planner knows what assets are now and will be available; he knows the constraints and restrictions established for the mission. He has identified the acceptable levels of risk. A list of essential tasks has been identified and the planning cell has restated the mission, to include who, what, when, where, and why. The mission analysis is forwarded to the commander for approval. The commander will review and approve the analysis; or he may clarify and/or restate the mission. A-4. Developing Courses of Action The first stage in developing courses of action (COA) is the situation and the considerations that need to be identified and answers found. The amount of time available significantly influences the planning process. Military solutions may be constrained; a COA may be limited by available resources, or political and diplomatic considerations may need to be taken into account. A regional, rather than global, focus for deliberate planning allows increased flexibility in apportionment of available combat forces. Section II. SAMPLE FORMAT FOR THE PREVENTIVE MEDICINE ESTIMATE A-5. General a . The purpose of the PVNTMED estimate is to recommend COA to the commander on issues such as site selection and risk management. The planning process for CHS operations in stability operations and support operations is the same process as used for traditional CHS operations. The CHS estimate of the situation is the basic tool used by the CHS planner. A detailed discussion of each subparagraph of the CHS estimate is provided in FM 8-55. The information contained in this appendix supplements the discussion in FM 8-55. The considerations are similar; however, the range of options and COA are expanded. These expanded options include missions and functions not accomplished during the more traditional CHS operations (such as the assessment of the HN medical infrastructure). b. All of the categories of the CHS estimate are presented in FM 8-55. Some of the categories may seem contrived when applying them to stability operations and support operations situations. The CHS planner must, therefore, interpret the categories and apply the pertinent information or modify the categories to fit the operational scenario. In some stability operations and support operations scenarios, there may not be a recognizable enemy; the enemy and friendly situation paragraphs of the estimate can be thought of as negative and positive factors impacting on the successful accomplishment of the mission. For example, in a discussion of opposition groups, it is conceivable that an organized opposition may not be apparent in a country where a humanitarian assistance program or disaster relief effort is being conducted. The CHS planner should, therefore, consider those situations and factors which could foster an insurgency or the formation of opposition groups and focus the CHS operations to correct anticipated deficiencies, thereby eliminating the possible threat.
