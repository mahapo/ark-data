Humanity has seen many close calls over the course of its history, from wars to economic collapse, and even pandemics. Although many prepper books are centered on surviving in the wild, we realize that if a catastrophe were to happen, most of us will find ourselves in an urban environment. This is not to say that many of the same techniques will not apply, but you need to be able to adapt to the environment you live in, take advantage of it, and understand which strategies may or may not work in it. In this book, we will go through many different situations, and how you can respond to them. It is important to build a base and fortify it and to build a sustainable source of food. But most importantly you must build your stockpile of goods, medication, and tools that you will need in"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"order to survive for as long as you can. In these scenarios, we always expect help to come eventually, in whatever form, or for civilization to restore itself. We don’t think about the possibility that help may not come, partly because it is an extremely frightening prospect and partly because it isn’t that likely. Humans are extremely adaptable and have always found their way back. In a disaster situation we can expect civilization to be restored, eventually. In any case, in this book, you will find the information you need to survive prolonged periods of time without contact with civilization, and to build a sustainable source of food that can last for many years. You will learn about building shelters, putting together first aid kits, how to stockpile and how to build a survival garden. We hope, of course, to never have to use these skills, but the world is unpredictable, and it is always best to be prepared."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Disaster Preparation Making a Plan Making a plan is the first step to being ready for any disaster, regardless of what disaster that may be. There are several things that you and your family or friends all need to be aware of in case you are not all together when an emergency strikes. The first thing you should all be aware of is the different warnings and emergency alerts that you may receive. Usually, when an emergency happens, safety officials have a number of different ways to alert you. When you receive an alert, you will usually have enough time to gather everything you need. Below is a breakdown of the various alerts you may receive: Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEAs) Wireless Emergency Alerts are usually short messages that are sent from an official authority be that federal, state, local, or regional. They are transmitted from cell towers. Usually, these alerts are sent out to people if they are in danger or potentially in danger. This could be both man-made or natural disasters. Depending on the emergency, there are several types of wireless emergency alerts; AMBER (America’s Missing: Broadcast Emergency Response) Alerts, Imminent Threat Alerts, Public Safety Alerts, or Presidential alerts. Amber Alert The Amber Alert is the most frequent type of alert. It is sent out to the public when a local child has been abducted. The speed of these alerts is oftentimes crucial to returning the child home safely. The aim of an Amber Alert is to instruct the local community to assist in locating the child. Public Safety Alert A public safety alert is sent out when a threat has passed or is not imminent. This could include natural disasters or other human-related situations. Imminent Threat Alerts These are more severe than public safety alerts and are sent out when you are directly in harm’s way. Again, the threat could be man-made or natural such as extreme weather. Presidential Alerts These alerts are only sent when a national disaster or emergency occurs. They are sent out"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"nationwide so anyone with a cell phone is able to receive it. There are several things that you need to know about WEA alerts. Firstly, they are messages that appear on your phone screen and let you know the type of threat at hand, as well as any action that you should follow. It is a small message, no longer than 360 characters. These alerts have a unique vibration and tone so they are easily recognizable. They are broadcasted through local cell towers so anyone near it will receive it and the congestion of phone networks does not affect the time it takes for the message to be delivered. Because of the way these alerts are sent, you can receive them if there’s a threat where you are, even if you don’t live nearby. These alerts are based on your current location. Emergency Alert System (EAS) EAS are national public warnings and are designed to allow the president to address the nation within 10 minutes when the country is under a national emergency. However, the president is not the only one who can access this system; these alerts can be issued by local and state authorities in order to give out weather warnings, AMBER alerts, and imminent threat warnings. This system is operated by the FCC, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Weather Service (NWS). They maintain the EAS, as well as coordinate WEA warnings, making them the two main bodies responsible for maintaining national security. NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) The NOAA Weather Radio is a nationwide radio broadcast, as well as a radio network where information about extreme weather is announced, but it also broadcasts other emergencies such as national security threats or public safety. Working with FCC, the NWR’s broadcast makes it a one-stop-shop for finding out any weather- related issues that might be taking place in the country. Shelter Plan Sheltering is almost always appropriate in emergency or disaster situations. Seeking shelter is usually done at the home, office, or any other location if danger is imminent and there is not time for you to go to a safer place."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The time you spend sheltering may vary depending on the emergency. You need to stay informed in order to estimate how long you might have to shelter for and how strictly to ration your supplies. Making sure you, your family, or friends have the necessities to survive, such as food and water, is essential, especially if the sheltering time is undefined. When sheltering, there are two main courses of action depending on the emergency and where you are: going to a Mass Care Shelter or sheltering in place. Here are the main differences and how you should proceed in each situation. Mass Care Shelters Although most Mass Care Shelters provide supplies such as food and water, you should take your emergency kit with you. Usually, these places are crowded with little to no room, and having all your necessities with you is a great advantage. In a Mass Care Shelter, you should also bring hygiene products, such as sanitizers, soaps, and other general cleaning products. If you are in the US, you can find your nearest shelter by texting SHELTER followed by your zip code to 43362. Sheltering in Place Often, when an emergency strikes, you should stay where you are, especially if going outside seems risky. You always need to be prepared to take shelter where you are at the moment of disaster. This could be at home, in your office, or in any other building. If you haven’t received an alert but think that there might be a dangerous situation arising, you need to use your common sense and assess the situation carefully. This might happen if local or national authorities cannot immediately provide you with information about what is happening. Here are some tips on how to behave in such a situation: ● Try to stay informed, by watching TV, listening to the radio, or following information on your cell phone. ● Close windows, lock doors, and air vents, as well as any other openings such as fireplaces. ● Turn off any other system that might circulate air between the outside and inside such as air conditioning or fans. ● Find a place with as few windows as possible. ● Seal windows, doors, and vents with plastic sheeting. "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Evacuation Plan Before and During Evacuation Planning for an emergency also means planning for an evacuation. In some situations, you may have time to take your time, in others you may have to evacuate immediately. You need to understand what kind of emergency you are in in order to correctly prepare for an evacuation. After that, you need to identify what places are available for you to evacuate to, such as community shelters, a family or friend’s home in another city, or even a hotel. Knowing alternate routes in your area and how to procure various means of transportation can also help you evacuate in a safer, faster way. Keep in mind, that depending on the situation, evacuating on foot might be the best option. You should also have a plan in place to meet up with your family or have a way to contact them in case you become separated. It is important to have an emergency kit, or a “go-bag” ready in case you need to leave on foot. It should contain supplies that will last you a long time, such as canned goods. It may be possible to evacuate by car, so you should keep an emergency kit in your car at all times and make sure that tank of gas is consistently topped up as gas stations may be closed during an emergency. During an evacuation, it’s important to remember to take with you a battery-powered radio. You should have already downloaded the FEMA app so you know where open shelters are in your area. If you have pets, keep in mind that most public shelters only allow service dogs. If you have the time, you should try to secure your home by locking doors and windows, unplugging any electrical appliances such as TVs and microwaves, and if you are instructed to, shut off your gas, electricity, and water. However, this might not be needed in all cases. Leave home with thick shoes, or boots, long pants, and long-sleeved shirts so you have extra protection outside. Before leaving, you should check if your neighbors might need a ride. If your car is full, try to provide them with some supplies if they need them, or arrange for someone to pick them up. After Evacuation Before returning from an evacuation, make sure your national or regional authorities have given the green light. Ensure that there is no debris or any other disruptions on the road on your way back. Bring supplies, such as water and food for your return and if you are coming back by car, make"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"sure you don’t run out of fuel, or ensure there will be a gas station open. Avoid downed power lines as these might still be live, if you encounter any, call the emergency services to inform them. If you return home and you have no power, you can use generators, but it is important to know that you shouldn't use these inside your home or connect them to the electrical system in your house. If you need to use a generator, connect it to an external electrical plug. If You Are Evacuating with Pets Making a plan for your pet will enable you to execute a smoother evacuation. It is important to note that many public shelters do not allow pets, which can cause you a lot of stress in an emergency situation. Knowing what you are going to do with your pet before emergency strikes can save their life. Establish an evacuation plan with your neighbors or friends in case you are unable to evacuate your pet yourself. Also, having your pet microchipped can be very helpful if it ever gets lost. You should also put together an emergency kit for your pet, as you would for you and your family. This shouldn’t differ much from your own emergency kit; you will need food, water, medicine if your pet needs it, and a first aid kit. You should also include an ID tag and a leash, as well as your pet’s information and any other important medical documents. Ideally, you would place your pet in a crate or a carrier and make sure you put in items or toys that your pet is familiar with, as this often helps them reduce their stress. If your animals or pets can’t be put in a carrier because of their size, evacuate them as soon as you can in vehicles or trailers. Make sure the place where you are taking them can meet your animal’s basic needs, such as water, food, and veterinary care. If you have large farm animals such as cows or horses and you cannot evacuate them, you should put them inside a barn or another large building, or if you think the emergency at hand will destroy the barn/building, you should set them loose as they may have a better chance of surviving. Building a Kit When a disaster or emergency strikes, we won’t know what to expect. Worst case scenario, we could be on our own for several days before returning to safety. This means that a well-built"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"disaster kit is essential. You will need some basic items and some additional emergency supplies. Here’s a comprehensive list of supplies: Basic Items ● Water (aim to have a gallon per person/day) ● Food (several days’-supply) ● Battery-powered radio and a NOAA radio ● First aid kit ● Extra batteries ● Flashlight ● Duct tape and plastic sheeting ● Dust mask ● Pliers or a wrench ● Can opener ● Local maps ● Cell phone with backup batteries These are items that you should always have with you in an emergency, however, if you can, you should add these extra items to your kit: Additional Supplies ● Prescribed medication ● Eyeglasses or contact lenses if you need ● Cash ● Sleeping bag or blankets ● Matches ● Personal identification documents ● Fire extinguisher You should make your emergency kit and keep it in a safe place for when you might need it. Make sure to store your kit in an appropriate place, for example, canned food needs to be kept in a dry place. You should also replace any expired items and go through all the emergency items to make sure they are still intact and change them if necessary. Because you don’t know when an emergency will strike, you should prepare at least three different emergency kits; one for your home, one for your car, and one for your workplace."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" Survival Kit for the Injured Many of us might have an issue with turning away people that seek our help, especially if they are badly wounded. If this is the case with you, then you can put together a charity survival kit. Obviously, only do this if you have enough supplies for yourself and your family. Here’s a list of what you might want to include: ● a couple of bottles of water ● a couple of cans of food with a can opener ● an emergency blanket ● a map with directions to the nearest shelter ● a set of clean clothes ● a few strike-everywhere matches Place these items in a plastic bag so they don’t get wet and place them anywhere outside your perimeter (we will talk about this later in the book). If someone comes close to your perimeter and you feel the need to help them, tell them where the charity kit is. Making a plan ahead of time is one of the most important things you can do. If an emergency situation strikes, and you don’t have a plan, chances are that you will not survive long. These types of plans require a lot of thinking, time to stockpile goods and medical items and they cannot be rushed. Without a plan, you will be lost. It is important to understand the first signs of an emergency, such as understanding the different alerts and how to proceed when one is issued. There are a few different ones and depending on which one is sent, you should know what to do next. Along with a general plan for emergency situations, you should also have a shelter plan, for both short and long term, whether it is a government shelter or your own home. An evacuation plan is also essential when a local catastrophe strikes; knowing where to go, whether it is a family member’s house or a friend's house that is far from yours and far from the emergency. You need to prepare for these situations and have an evacuation kit that is already assembled, so all you need to do is grab it and leave your home. Being prepared is really important when it comes to surviving emergency situations, and the truth is, you can never be too prepared."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Prepper’s Long-Term Survival Guide If a major disaster happens, we may need to be in survival mode for the long-term, or at least be prepared for that scenario. For these scenarios to play out, the catastrophes need to be big enough to bring society to a halt. This would certainly bring about lot of chaos and confusion. Fortunately, these situations almost never happen, but it is always better to be prepared in case one does happen someday. Before we go through what we should do in a worst-case scenario, let us talk about the different situations we may find ourselves in. You will have to behave slightly differently depending on the type of catastrophe. Famine Famine is a severe lack of food that spreads nationwide or worldwide. There are many reasons this could happen, massive crop failure, or a situation where the amount of available food decreases sharply. Examples of this could be a disease affecting crops, a long drought or flooding, for example, back in 1995, a series of floods brought food shortages to North Korea. Sometimes political measures can also affect food distribution. Another infamous case was the Irish Potato Famine which occurred between 1845 and 1852 and killed around one million people. This was caused by a disease in the potatoes, but the biggest issue here was the lack of food diversity - most of the population came to rely on one variety of potatoes, the Irish Lumper. Other diseases started to spread as a result of people’s failing immune systems and the lack of medical care and other basic necessities. Fortunately, we have learned from those mistakes and we grow different varieties of crops to try and prevent famine from occurring. However, in this era of global warming and climate change, a similar situation could happen. Pandemic This one might still be fresh in the mind for many of us, but the pandemic that occurred in 2019, due to a spread of a flu-like disease, doesn’t really compare to other pandemics throughout our history. A pandemic is when a large number of people throughout a large area, or across a number of countries are affected by the same disease. One of the worst pandemics affecting humanity was the Black Plague, where reports say that around 200 million people died between 1347 and 1350. That was about 60 percent of the world population at the time. Historians believe this plague started near China and was transported to Europe in ships and other routes, through fleas on rats."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"There have been other cases throughout history, more recently during World War I, when there was an outbreak of the H1N1 flu virus otherwise known as the Spanish flu. This flu pandemic was particularly scary because it affected healthy young adults more severely because the healthier the person was, the harder the flu attacked. Economic Collapse An economic collapse is quite a hard concept to define when compared to other disasters, mainly because many things could fall under the term. For example, economic depression, hyperinflation, mass unemployment or mass bankruptcies. A recent example of this was when Russia’s economy collapsed in 1998. At the time, banks closed and people panic-bought goods. Inflation increased more than 80%. While the country was going through that, the value of the ruble, Russia’s currency, crashed. People living in urban areas had no means to get food and had to wait in hour-long lines to get something to eat. Terrorism and War Depending on where you live, terrorism and war could still be a real threat. The events of 9/11 for instance, changed how the U.S dealt with terrorism and its own security. And the possibility of war can never be taken off the table. Although this might be hard to imagine for some, one has to be prepared for any events that might disturb our way of life. None of this means that events like this will happen any time soon, or even in your lifetime but it is savvy to make preparations and take the necessary steps to increase your chances of survival in case war does break out. Water Procurement The human body can survive without water for about three days; however, chances are, in a disaster situation people won’t survive that long without water. Regular consumption of water is essential to maintain your healthy body and keep your mind sharp. We need water for hygiene purposes too, which means that humans use quite a lot of water in a single day, about a hundred gallons to be precise. The problem in a disaster situation is often not the scarcity of water in general, but the scarcity of potable water. So, in case of an emergency, you need to have quite a lot more water than you think if you want to survive long term. In a disaster situation, there are four possible types of water source; your own water reserves,"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"rainwater, drilled wells, and natural resources, such as lakes or rivers. Storing Water If you want to store water for an emergency, you need to plan beforehand. Water can be quite the load to carry, both because it's heavy and because it takes up space. Everyone can move a gallon of water; however, the issue is when you need to carry other items too. There are some great products out there that can help you carry large amounts of water and which would certainly be a good addition to your survival kit. Nevertheless, this doesn’t change the fact that it is still heavy and takes up a lot of space. Having access to even a small reserve of water is extremely important, but moving large quantities of it, especially in an emergency, is not very feasible. But if you keep a static storage of water, you will find it easier to collect some if you need to evacuate in a hurry. However, if you have a static source of water, you need to store it properly so it doesn’t go rancid and make sure you rotate your water at least every six months. Disinfecting and storing water If you don’t have access to bottled water, you can use tap water, however, you might need to disinfect your water before you store it so that bacteria and viruses don’t multiply once it is stored. The simplest way to do this is by boiling the water. This is enough to kill any bacteria, pathogens, or viruses. If you're taking water from natural sources, let it sit for a minute before you filter it using a towel, a coffee filter, or a clean cloth. Let it cool down before you store it and you should add a pinch of salt for every quart of water. However, boiling water in an emergency situation might not be possible, when this happens you can disinfect your water by using household bleach, but, not any old bleach, you must use unscented chlorine bleach. Do not use colored bleach or bleach that contains other cleaning agents; just regular bleach. It should only have between 6 to 8.25% of sodium hypochlorite. Another important thing to remember is that you only need a couple of drops per quart. You should have a dropper in your emergency kit for these situations. Once that is done, stir the water and let it stand for 30 minutes. At this point, the water should have a very light smell of chlorine, however, if it doesn’t you should repeat the process and let it stand for 15 minutes. If the opposite happens and the water tastes too much like chlorine, you should add more water from your water source and wait a few hours until it dilutes. For reference, here is the amount of bleach you should add depending on the volume of water: ● for one quart, add 2 drops if it’s 6% or 8.25% ● for a gallon, add eight drops if it’s 6%, or 6 drops if it’s 8.25%"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"From here, just double every time the volume of water doubles. You should note, however, that if your faucet uses municipal water, this already contains chlorine as well as other chemicals that enable it to be stored for a few months. In order to begin to store water, the first thing you need to do is to purchase cases of bottled water, if you look around for discounts you will find some at a fair price. This bottled water is essential for the first few days of an emergency, where everything is in a chaotic state and everyone is rushing to get resources, you will have the peace of mind of being able to drink bottled water. You will then have the time to focus on making more plans for the next few days. When preparing your supply of emergency water, hide it away out of sight, so the family doesn’t go and use it every time they are looking for water. In an emergency situation, the water you have stored should only be used for cooking and drinking, for everything else, use water from other sources. You may be wondering if that large swimming pool in your backyard would be a good source of water. You could use it for bathing but you can’t consume it. Besides having higher levels of chlorine, there are also lots of other chemicals and stabilizers used in pool water. This is not good for drinking or cooking, however, for bathing and washing your clothes it’s not a problem. When it comes to wells, the situation is a little trickier. They contain water that you can drink and cook with and because they come with ready-made storage, they would be really handy to have around. However, in an emergency, when the power is out, it could be a problem. You need electricity to pump the water from a well into your home, so you would need the power to extract water from the well. However, there’s still a solution; hand pumps. These can help bring water from wells into your faucets, with the only disadvantage being their cost, which is around $1,000. Although when it comes to surviving, that is a small price to pay. They are also fairly easy to install yourself. If you have a gutter system in your home, you can collect rainwater. However, you need to place a barrel or some sort of container on the gutter downspout to collect it. If you don’t have a gutter system, you should consider getting one, perhaps you can even install it yourself as without one, it's hard to catch rainwater efficiently. Remember, if you are using barrels, sometimes it might be hard to access the water so consider installing a spigot at the bottom of the barrel. You will still need to filter the water that collects the barrels, as it goes through roofing and will catch debris on the way down. Wild water sources can be extremely useful in an emergency situation. These include lakes, rivers, ponds, or anything else that has running freshwater. In an emergency situation, you need to remember that you are probably not the only one that knows about a certain water source, so if you want to avoid any human contact, it is best to leave these as a last resort. Another thing to"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"worry about is disinfecting the water you collect. Waterborne pathogens can be very dangerous, and they are usually found in wild water sources, regardless of how clean the water might seem. If you are using natural water sources, you need to find a way to store the water and take it back to your refuge. Buckets are one option and you could bring a cart, or a wheelbarrow to transport them back to your house or shelter. If a cart or a wheelbarrow is out of the question, try a shoulder pole instead - it may require a little more effort but will help you bring that water buckets back to your shelter safely. Remember, when searching for wild sources of water, always look for running sources, such as rivers, these are less likely to have algae and other pathogens. Filtration and Disinfection You will need to filter and disinfect the water you collect from natural sources. Sometimes, the terms filtration and disinfection are used interchangeably, but they mean two different things. When you disinfect, you are killing pathogens or other viruses that may be in your water. When you filter it, you are removing parasites and larger debris that can be found in the water. Let’s have a look at how we can do both in an emergency situation. How should you go about filtering a bucket filled with dirty water from a wild source and turning it into drinkable water? Short answer: you have to build a filtration system. Start by using plastic bottles, ideally two-liter plastic ones. First, cut off the bottom of the bottles and place a coffee filter on it, make sure the lid is screwed on. Next, you will need to build the filter, which you can do using everyday materials, or stuff that you can easily get in DIY stores. First, place a small layer of activated charcoal, then add an inch or two of fine grain over the charcoal, and lastly, add gravel (the smaller the gravel the better) This should be enough to filter your water, but you can test it by adding coloring to the water and making it run down your DIY water filter, if the water comes out clean, it is well-filtered. This is an easy water filter to make as it only uses everyday items, however, you will need to change the filter regularly or every time the water runs slower than usual, or is not filtering properly. Disinfection will allow us to kill off any bacteria or pathogens that may have passed through the filter. Boiling the water should be enough to safely drink the water. There is also another great disinfection method which uses ultraviolet rays. To filter your water through solar disinfection, all you need to do is place the clear, bottled water in the sun. Make sure you remove any labeling on the bottle and that the bottle is clear and not colored. You still have to make sure the water is properly filtered before exposing it to the sunrays. If you have access to a rooftop, this might be an even better position to place your"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"bottles of water. You should leave them in the sun for a whole day. If the sun is not shining brightly or the sky is cloudy, you should leave the bottles for two days. Alternatively, you can use UV disinfection products, these are portable devices and are usually battery-powered, or crank-powered. If you are using any of these devices, all you need is a short burst of UV light to disinfect your water. In an emergency situation, you should choose the crank-powered ones, so you don’t have to rely on batteries. If all of these strategies fail, you can resort to calcium hypochlorite, or as it is best known, pool shock. However, look for 100% calcium hypochlorite and avoid anything that contains any other disinfectants. To disinfect the water with this, first, you need to add a teaspoon into two gallons of water, and then use a wooden spoon to stir it. Don’t use a metal one, as this solution will corrode it. Once that solution is well mixed, add it to your water. Keep in mind, though, that the ratio here is one pint of the solution to twelve and a half gallons of the water you want to disinfect. Water is probably the most important resource we need in an emergency. Being cautious and storing it beforehand can significantly increase our chances of survival in an emergency situation. Searching for and Storing Food After water, food is the most essential requirement a person has, but food can be even scarcer than water, especially if you think that is harder to stockpile than water is, and it doesn’t fall from the sky either. You could store large amounts of freeze-dried food, but having a diet solely comprised of that could make you ill, mainly because of the high quantities of sodium. Although it is not a bad plan to store some, it is hardly a solution to survive long term. Diversification of the food you store is essential to maintaining a balanced diet. In an emergency situation, there are three main sources of food; your own stores, growing food, and wild sources such as hunting or fishing. Let’s see how we would go about each of these options. Storing Food While storing enough food to last for years might not be feasible for everyone, you should, at least, have some food reserves. When preparing your emergency plan, you should aim to have around three months of food stored. When you add other foods such as berries and vegetables or anything that you can grow, you can stretch your food storage to last for at least six months. This shouldn’t be your first option when in an emergency, instead it should be a sort of a safety net if your most immediate sources of food don’t work out. When storing food, you should consider canned food, but also dry, or dried food such as pasta,"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"grains and vegetables. Here are a few foods to consider when preparing your food reserves: ● Canned vegetables and fruits - These may not be as tasty as fresh ones but they still have the necessary nutrients and protein your body needs. They are extremely easy to store and last for at least a whole year. ● Rice - Store only white and brown rice, and be careful not to store long grain or any aromatic types of rice, as these have oils that can go bad. ● Beans – They are easy to store in cans, and are filled with protein. They are a great substitute for meat if you can’t find any. ● Stews and soups - These are one of the easiest foods to make, and you can literally just add whatever food you have to hand and let it boil. This might be a great option in an emergency situation, and you can add flavor just by dropping a stock cube into it. ● Canned meat - Although not the best tasting food, it can be handy if hunting is not an option. ● Dry pasta - Dry pasta, when properly stored, can last for a very long time. Plus, it is easy to cook. It should be one of your top foods in your storage. ● Sprouts - These are very easy to grow and are high in proteins and nutrients. A great choice to have around, and they come in many varieties. In less than a week you can have them growing in your garden. All you need to do is rinse the seeds in water, and leave them in a jar overnight. The next day, drain the water and keep the seeds moist for three to five days, after which you will be able to harvest your sprouts. ● Cooking oils - In an emergency situation, the best oils to store are olive and vegetable oil, as they last for longer. Don’t forget to use oils as they have essential fats that your body needs to work properly. ● Herbs and spices - These are probably not that important in terms of the nutrients they can provide your body, but they are essential to make any food taste good. Plus, in their dry form, they are easy to store. Growing Food Our gardens can provide us with great sources of food and we should take full advantage of them. Growing food takes time and, in an emergency, it will certainly be hard to acquire any seeds from the store, so it is best to be prepared. But in times of peace, the store is the best place to find seeds for growing vegetables, in fact, you"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"can also harvest the seeds from the fruits and vegetables that you grow in order to grow more. Planning how to grow food is a time-consuming process, however, it is essential if you want to have access to an array of different fruits and vegetables. You can start by listing vegetables that you and your family usually eat. Then, you will need to understand what type of crops grow well in the area you live in, as well as the times it takes to grow each crop and how to grow them properly. You should stock up on those seeds and if you can, you should start growing your little garden straight away and not wait for it to be too late. Having the necessary experience in an emergency situation can be extremely helpful. Raising Animals Raising animals is something that you should also consider as having a diverse diet is very important, even more so in an emergency situation. Things like chickens, rabbits, sheep, and goats are easier to get and take care of. There are many classes, both online and offline that can teach you how to raise farm animals, but you should opt for offline courses as you will probably get more practical experience that way. If you want something more than just meat, and you have the possibility, consider raising tilapia fish. These fish are easy to breed, and grow fast, all you need is a small pond and food for them. Foraging Wild edibles can be found virtually anywhere. Foraging helped early humans to survive, so it can certainly help us too in an emergency situation. You should be able to find various courses on foraging wild edibles. Local classes are great because they will teach you about the edibles you might find in your particular area. It is also really important to know which types of plants you will find in which season. One great way to get familiar with the edibles in your area is to go for walks, or hikes, and practice identifying plants. You have to remember that some of the berries and plants you find can be dangerous and eating them could have serious health implications. It is therefore essential to know which ones are safe to eat and which ones are not. Eating plants that are not safe will only cause you more problems. Fishing, Hunting, and Trapping Before a disaster situation strikes you should learn how to fish, hunt, and trap wild animals and understand how many times you should do so in order to maintain a healthy balance of ingredients. For those of you that live in a city or suburbs, this might be a little more complicated, mainly"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"because of the scarcity of animals, as well as the number of hunters out there. With that said, hitting the trail and searching for wild animals to hunt shouldn’t be your primary way of obtaining food. Note that, some of the techniques explained in the following section, might not be legal where you live. However, many of these laws might not be binding if society falls and we need to fight for our own survival. With that said, if you want to practice your hunting and fishing skills in times of peace, do so, within the law. Fishing When fishing for survival, automatic fishing reels and trotlines can help you increase your catches. A trotline is a heavy line that has smaller ones hanging from it, allowing you to have more lines in the water and thus a greater chance of capturing more fish. It is easier to fish using trotlines in rivers and smaller streams where water runs, rather than in more static waters such as lakes. A rope or a larger cord, is placed across a river’s banks, and in between those, you have smaller threads of fish lines called snoods. Because each snood has a hook, the odds of success increase exponentially. There are a few things that you need to know when fishing with trotlines, such as the precise space between snoods. You need to leave some space between the smaller lines, to stop them from getting tangled together. Another great advantage of fishing with a trotline is that you don’t necessarily need to be holding the rod, you can leave it and come back and check it a few times a day, to retrieve fish and to free more hooks. However, this might not be the best option if you don’t have the river or the stream to yourself, as other people might come and steal your hard-caught fish. With automatic reels, you have more freedom to do other things while you are fishing. You will find them in most fishing and hunting shops, and they will certainly be of great help if you find yourself in survival mode. All you need to do is drop the hook with the bait into the water and attach the reel to something heavy like a tree trunk or a rock. The struggling of the fish, when hooked, will activate the reel to pull out of the water and retract the line. But of course, it is not as simple as finding a river and going fishing. You need to know where to fish, and if the fish population around your area is healthy enough to keep producing fish for the long term. Knowing the species that live in the lake or river will also help you find the best way to capture the fish. Trapping Traps are a great way to acquire wild meat, mainly because you won’t need to be present at all times, you just need to set up the trap and come and check on it once in a while to see if you have caught something. In fact, if this is going to be your way of obtaining wild meat, you should set quite a few and check them at least once every day. However, you don’t want to spend too much"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"time in the same place setting up traps or constantly checking if they have caught anything, as this might frighten the very creatures you want to capture. There are many varieties of snares and other traps that are easy to set up. However, understanding how to properly use a snare, takes some practice. It is good to understand what type of animals you can trap in your area, so you can set up the right size of snares, and know where to place them. Hunting Your ability to hunt for wild meat really depends on your skill and experience. Usually, people hunt using firearms or bows. You need to know the population of wild animals in your area, as well as what species live there. If it is mainly big game, such as deer, you might be better off by hunting, however, if the local wildlife population is more based on smaller animals such as rabbits, or foxes then trapping might be easier for you to put food on the table. Hygiene Personal hygiene will be one of those things that will deteriorate the longer you are in survival mode. Scarcity of hygiene products, and lack of sewer line cleaning, will make your hygiene harder to maintain. The good news is that your body, or in particular, your nose, will get used to it rather quickly. Let us go through the different sections of hygiene and ways to mitigate certain issues. Toilet Facilities If you stay indoors, in a home, or any other place with a toilet, in the short term, you will have no problem flushing after you have used it. Flushes can still be used even without power; all you need to do is manually fill the tank. However, this will stop working once sewer lines stop being cleaned and the waste has nowhere to go. You should plan for such an event. Although chemical toilets can be a potential solution, they might also not work in the long term, as you would have to store large amounts of whatever chemical you use to treat the waste. That leaves us with much simpler solutions, first up: buckets. You can find and purchase buckets at any hardware store. If you get a five-gallon bucket or bigger, you can add your own toilet seat, which will end up being a relative luxury. In the bottom of the bucket, you will need to add some sand and keep the source of sand nearby with a scoop, so you can cover the waste. If you have baking soda or laundry detergent, you can add a little over it, but you are probably better off if you save those for other things. Ideally, every member of your family or group should have their own bucket, and once it is half full, you need to throw the waste away, or it might get too full to move it around. If buckets and sand are not a viable option, heavy-duty bags can do the trick,"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"however, these need to be emptied more often because you don’t want to have the bag burst open when you are trying to move it. Alternatively, you can dig a hole or a latrine, but this requires significantly more work. Although if you do choose to dig a latrine, make sure you dig it wide enough (about two or three feet), and deep enough (also two or three feet). After you have used it, cover the waste with a scoop of earth or dirt. Toilet paper won’t last forever, so you will eventually need to think about a solution for that problem. Magazines and newspapers are a great solution, but old clothes, such as t-shirts, or socks will work better in the long term, as you can wash them. It is always important to wash your hands after you have used the toilet, but in survival situations like this, it is essential. Whether you use sanitizer or wash your hands in a river, it is important that you do it. If you are using sanitizer, remember that you will have alcohol in your hands, at least straight after you have used it, don’t go near open flames or any other flammable components or you might catch fire. Laundry This is one of those things that you might only remember to do after a week or so into an emergency situation, but in the long term can be quite important. Planning for it is just as essential as anything else, and with the right preparation, you can set yourself up well. Hand washing your clothes can be both time and energy-consuming. However, you can make it easier by purchasing a large tub, a smaller tub, and a washboard. Fill up the large tub with water and detergent, ideally a biodegradable one, and scrub. Place the washed clothes in a smaller tub with just water and hang them out to dry. It may be that you can’t get hold of a washboard, if that is the case, you need to scrub them with your hands, slap them against a large rock, or anything hard and not particularly dirty, although this is less efficient. You could achieve the same results with a large bucket, a lid, and a plunger. Make a hole in the lid, just large enough for the handle of the plunger to fit in, add water, and detergent and use the plunger to clean your clothes. You should use a little scrubbing brush just to take out the more stubborn stains. Showering and Bathing The best thing you can do when it comes to being able to maintain personal hygiene is to purchase a camp shower. They are easy to transport and hang on a tree branch. All you need to do is fill the camp shower bag with water and leave it to be heated up by the sun, although don’t expect it to be as hot as a regular shower. These camp shower bags come with a nozzle and a"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"hose like a sort of showerhead. Ideally, you would have a large container which you would stand in so you can catch as much of the water as possible and reuse it for other things. If you can’t get a camp shower, then, the next best thing is to have someone pour water from a bucket over you. It might be slightly more primitive, but it is just as efficient. If you are in a situation where water is rather scarce and it is impossible to take showers, a sponge bath is your next solution. You can clean yourself that way, it takes a little longer, but it also requires a lot less water. With roughly two cups of water, you can have a sponge bath. Save and stock up shampoo and soap. However, you don’t need expensive stuff and every soap and shampoo will do pretty much the same thing. Tooth Care Taking care of your teeth is important in an emergency situation where you can’t go to a dentist. A bad toothache can be very painful and stop you from doing your regular daily activities, which can translate into a lack of food and other necessities. Toothbrushes are cheap, so you can stash quite a few of them, when it comes to toothpaste, that can be quite tricky to get and you may eventually run out. In that eventuality, you can add salt and baking soda together to make a fairly effective toothpaste. You will need two parts baking soda to one part salt. You won’t feel as fresh as after using regular toothpaste, but it will do the trick. Remember to also stockpile some dental floss and mouthwash as these will be essential for your oral hygiene. If you run out of mouthwash, you can make a primitive one with equal parts water and hydrogen peroxide. The main objective here is to avoid developing cavities, abscesses, and other issues that can be really painful, or even life-threatening if they are not properly treated. Waste Disposal We need to be able to dispose of all the waste that we generate. In today’s society, its easy, all we do is place all of our waste into our garbage cans and every week or so, someone comes and picks it up. However, it poses a much bigger problem when you are in survival mode. Let’s start with general garbage. This is waste that people generate through food, packaging, or anything else that does not come out of our bodies. Families, in particular, can generate quite a lot of garbage. In an emergency situation, you should look at burning some of it, but also try to reuse any of it if you can. Plastic containers and tin cans, can be turned into vases for plants, or form part of an alarm system. The more creative you get, the less garbage you have to dispose of. If you can’t burn the rest, then the next solution would be to bury it somewhere far from your location. Also, don’t bury it close to a source of water, or your own crops as waste may become contaminated."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Human waste is a different type of waste and can actually be used for quite a few things. If you choose to dispose of it, you can bury it, but remember to do it far from water sources. Ideally, you would be digging a latrine and filling it up. Once it is about two feet from the top, bury it for good and start a new one. You can also burn it, but you need to let it dry for a couple of days, which can intensify the smell of it. You could also add flammable liquid to it in order to make it easier to burn. However, this is far from the best solution. Burying it is far better. However, you should use some of the waste as fertilizer for your garden. This can be great to grow crops faster and healthier. Although if you are doing that, you will need to keep urine and feces separate. For this, it is best to use a funnel to direct the urine into a jug or a bucket. To use urine in your garden, you need to let it age for a couple of months, then mix it with dirty water from your laundry for example. The mix here should be one part urine and eight parts water and then added the mix straight into the garden. The feces should be collected separately into a bucket, when that is full add a lid with a hole. You would have to let it sit for about a year before you could use it for composting. This is really a long-term situation, and you should still do it even if you don’t think the emergency will last that long because it is better to be prepared. We will talk more about how to use waste in your garden in another chapter. Keeping Warm Clothing and shelter are two basic necessities, depending on the weather where you are you could last a little longer without either, but in the long term, you wouldn’t survive being exposed so much. Ideally, your home would still be standing and even without power or water, it would still be the best shelter. If your home was destroyed or somehow unavailable to live in, the next best thing would be a family member’s house or a friend's house. The important thing is having a roof over your head and clothes to warm you up or protect you from the sun. Clothing Clothing should be a priority as it is your first defense against the weather. Even though many of us have entire wardrobes and closets filled with all types of clothes, bringing them with you in the eventuality that you need to leave your home might not be the most practical thing. In cases like this, you need to pick a few clothes. You would need to prepare some clothes in advance as much of the clothes we wear today would end up being too impractical and would offer very little protection in an emergency situation. When packing clothes for an emergency, you should prioritize comfort, practicality, and durability over fashion and style. Although this"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"seems logical, most people have never been in an emergency situation and would probably pick their favorite clothes rather than thinking logically. The best shoes to wear in a survival situation are comfortable ones. Thick socks will also help you protect against cold, water, and other dangers in the wild. You should go for high quality here, as the discounted socks people usually buy would not last very long with constant washing and use. Having thick and comfortable work boots is also a great option. Thick soles and ankle support is what you should be looking for. Packing a pair of sneakers when the weather is warmer is prudent, especially as you may need to walk quite a bit. If you live in an area where it snows quite frequently, get a pair of snow boots too. Pants are also essential. You will need some robust jeans which are comfortable for both walking and working in. These may be harder to hand wash and will take quite a long time to dry. Alternatively, cargo pants made out of cotton are a fantastic option; besides being comfortable, they usually have lots of pockets that will come in handy. A few pairs of shorts for when it’s warmer outside should also be part of your emergency closet. You don’t want them to be too short though, as they won’t protect your legs as much. Add in a couple of belts, even if you don’t need them to secure your pants in place as they can be extremely useful in other situations. When it comes to tops, choose ones which are durable and comfortable over fashionable. You should add t-shirts, button-down shirts, flannel shirts, long sleeve shirts and sweatshirts. Although underwear is not as essential as the items of clothing we have mentioned so far, it is still something that you want to have in an emergency. Underwear will help prevent sweat getting to certain body parts such as groins, and are really easy to wash and dry. You want to wear the same underwear for at least two weeks before you wash them, otherwise, you will be spending way too much time washing clothes and too little on other important activities. Outerwear such as heavy coats certainly has a place in your emergency closet. Especially if you live in an area where it rains or snows quite frequently. In fact, the head is where we lose most of our heat, so keeping it covered with a hood or a hat can keep us warmer for longer. You will need a pair of gloves that keep your hands warm but which allow you to maintain maximum dexterity in your fingers. You should also add in a rain poncho, these are cheap and can protect you from the rain, they are also easily foldable and light, so won’t occupy much space. Having a good quality parka for more severe winters can really help you get through the harsher months. If possible, pick one where you can remove the liner so you can make it warmer or cooler depending on the weather situation you are in. These are not that cheap but are essential if you live in extremely cold places."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"It is important, especially when it is cold outside, to dress in layers. Particularly if you are doing chores or physical tasks. You don’t want to get too hot and sweat over all your clothes especially if you take breaks and that sweat turns cold. With layers, you can easily remove and add clothes and manage your body temperature a lot better to avoid getting too sweaty. Something else to consider when preparing for an emergency is whether or not to pack camouflage clothes. Although this can be great if you are out hunting, providing you have the right camouflage for the environment you are in, most people live in suburbia, and this means that your camouflage won’t particularly help you. Just keep this in mind when picking out your clothes. For Spring and Summer months: ● shirts, loose-fitting ● comfortable and durable shorts ● hat For Fall and Winter months: ● long sleeve shirts ● gloves ● boots/ snow boots ● heavy coat ● sneakers ● jacket ● thick socks ● knit hat ● other shirts (ideally flannel) Shelter Ideally, your home will be your shelter as it already has everything you need, even if you end up with no power. Keep in mind that you should avoid lighting fires inside the house. Electrical heaters and other forms of heat that we are used to, won’t be working, and the risk of setting fire to your house is higher since smoke detectors will eventually run out of battery and the fire department will certainly not be operational. But to ensure both fire alarms and smoke detectors are still working, make sure they are in good condition, at least every month. Place them near the kitchen, if you usually cook there and near your bedrooms, in case a fire starts during the night. Having a fire extinguisher in easy-to-grab locations is also essential. If you don’t have access to one, baking soda can also help you put out fires. Remember, if a fire has started while you are cooking, don’t add water to put it out, because that fire probably is being fueled with grease"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"which can easily spatter everywhere and spread the fire. Also remember when you are cooking with fire, having good ventilation is key, so you and your family don’t suffer from carbon monoxide poisoning. But how do you keep yourself and your family warm if you can’t light a fire? Ideally, you and your family would be spread between one or two rooms maximum. If, for example, you live in a house with two floors, you should try to close off the upper floor so the heat remains on the first floor where you are. The more blankets you have the better, of course, and the more people under one or two blankets the more heat you can retain. If you have access to fire-safe bricks, you can do a little trick by heating them up and wrapping them in towels or clothes under the blankets you are using. If you don’t have fire-safe bricks, don’t use regular bricks as these will likely break. Instead use large rocks. However, there are situations where the cold won’t be an issue, and instead, the heat might. How do you cool off in high temperatures when the air conditioning is not working? Well, the first thing to do to keep your body temperature down is to do all the necessary chores early in the morning, or later in the afternoon when the sun is not as hot. If possible, don’t do tasks under the intense sun. If you have to, remember to take breaks to cool off, drink water, and, if you can, work under a shade. Remember to use light-colored clothes as these retain the heat a lot less than darker hues. The thinner the fabrics the better: usually cotton will do just fine under extreme heat. Having a hat, or a scarf around your head can help you keep the heat off your face; a wide- brimmed hat would be better as it would also cover your neck. At home, keeping the interior at a reasonable temperature and as cool as you can is essential. The heat can have consequences on your sleep and how you rest, and we need a good night’s sleep to stay healthy. Having curtains and drapes closed during the day will help keep the inside of the house cool. It is also important to keep the windows closed during the day and during the hours of extreme heat, only open them in the early morning or in the evening to let the cool air come in. If you have multiple windows, you can open them all to create cross ventilation and air out your shelter faster and more effectively. Insulated walls can be great to keep the cool air from leaving the house. If you don’t already have that in your home, you should think about investing in it. Having insulated walls can also keep you warmer in the winter. Planting trees on the west and east side of your property can also offer shade during the hotter months. However, this takes quite a long time, depending on the tree, and you need to keep them healthy, as a dead or dying tree can be a danger to your house. Power and Electricity In the long run, preparing for a power outage is redundant. However, you should still plan to"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"have some electronics working in the first few days of a long-term catastrophe. And if you are thinking that solar panels might save you when the power goes out, they won’t. These will also become useless when the rest of the power is cut off for safety measures. Plus installing one can be quite expensive, even though there are a few government programs that can help you, in long- term survival it seems a waste of money (in any normal circumstance, solar panels are great for the environment and save you a lot of money in the long term). The first thing you should do is assemble an emergency preparedness kit that includes supplies for both short and medium-term power outages. Having a generator can help you in the short term, but because they usually need fuel such as gasoline, or something similar, it would be hard to maintain them for a long time. In your emergency kit, you should have a couple of flashlights, lanterns, and a few extra batteries for radios, although if you can have crank-powered radio and flashlights, even better, as these can last you for a long time. Unplugging your electronics will keep you protected from temporary surges, and protect your electronics too. If you do have a generator and fuel to make it work, use it sparingly so as to extend its lifespan. Also, you should always use a generator outside your house, if you don’t know the wattage of your generator or the appliances you then refrain from using a generator at all, as this might break both devices. Candles are fair game, and probably one of the best sources of light at night, but you have to be very careful with them, a little slip and your house could catch on fire. Always use candles away from flammable objects like gas, wood, or curtains. The usual gas generators won’t cut it in a long-term survival situation. They are impossible to mask, which means sooner or later someone will know you are using one and either steal it or simply leverage it to get something in exchange, or you will inevitably run out of fuel for it. Saying that power generators are great as a short-term solution. However, portable solar generators can be a great alternative. These come in many shapes and forms, but usually are portable solar panels with inputs so you can use any device you want. Another product that might come in handy is a Biolite camp stove, this device converts heat into electricity, all you need to do is start a fire on the stove and the device will convert the energy for you through a USB port. Although with this device you can only charge something that is USB connected, you can be cooking while you do it. There is a myriad of other devices that can do that, you just need to search for one that suits your needs. Although even with all of this, you should be prepared to live a life with no electricity, and it is totally doable, humanity did that for thousands of years, even though it might be quite harsh at first."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Emergencies can come in many forms, famine, pandemics, economic collapse, or even war or terrorism. We need to be prepared for any of these scenarios. We need to adapt to these circumstances as quickly as we possibly can and find the best way to survive. In recent years, we have seen many of these catastrophes happening and although many didn’t bring the world to its knees, many people suffered. The day may arrive when our governments will not be able to keep order and we are in a situation where survival of the fittest will happen. One of the first things that you should look into is having a plan to search for water if you don’t have pre-established reserves. The human body will not survive more than two or three days without water, so knowing where to look for it, how to treat it and disinfect it, and also how to store it is important for your survival. After that, food should be your primary concern. If you have planned for such catastrophes, you should have a good stockpile of goods, however, these should not be your primary source of food, but instead a reserve for when you don’t have fresh food. When it comes to food procurement, hunting, fishing, trapping, and foraging should be your main activities. Learning how to do all of these things can help you survive for longer periods and put food on the table for you and your family. Knowing how to store your fresh food is also something that you should learn, as well as raising animals for food. Hygiene might not be one of your main priorities in the first few days of a catastrophe, however, you should plan for it too, especially since a disaster situation can drag on for a long time. Simple things like waste disposal and germs can become serious issues if you don’t take the necessary measures. Another thing that you should take into consideration is your clothing. This should be prepared according to the climate you are in. Plan what clothes are most important and put everything else to good use by making improvised bandages and other things that you might need. If you need to evacuate, you will only be able to take only a few pieces of clothing with you, so make sure you have that planned beforehand too."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" Book 2 The Preppers’s Guide to Natural Medicine   "},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" Nowadays you usually don’t even have to think about where or how to satisfy your thirst or hunger. If you get sick, you seek help from a doctor. But what if you find yourself in a situation where you are unable to access shops and pharmacies? What if you get sick and there are no hospitals, doctors, or ambulances around? This guide will help you safeguard your health and life if such a situation were ever to occur.  Introduction Do you have a disaster preparation plan? How can you prepare yourself for a situation in which you don’t have access to doctors, hospitals and pharmacies? The concept of survival has changed, and it is no longer understood exactly as it used to be. If we traveled back a few centuries, we would see that although life was much more difficult back then, people were much more able to independently cope with the problems that arose such as disease and natural disaster. They understood well the types of problems they may face and they were therefore equipped to deal with them. In contrast, in the modern world, we have been lulled into a sort of false sense of security. We feel protected by the trappings of modern life and often behave in an unnecessarily laid-back way. We can take a tiny computer out of our pocket and find the answer to the question we were"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"interested in or we can call for the necessary help. But the very conveniences that make life easier for us - modern gadgets that make it easier for us to explore new territories, cars that take us to the office, computers that process our requests and act according to complex algorithms, airplanes that carry us to the places we want to go - have weakened our survival skills and made us more vulnerable. Each of these amenities is a double-edged sword. Our reliance on automated, networked smart devices and machines has made us more dependent and less intelligent: we are unable to find our way even in the city, much less in unfamiliar territory, without the help of cell towers or satellites tracking our location from space. If you look at it from a different point of view, modern conveniences are beginning to look more and more like weaknesses that are compromising our ability to autonomously protect ourselves. If disaster strikes, will you be fully prepared for it? Do you have the knowledge necessary for such a situation? Can you survive? What does survival mean now, when the borders are easily traversable, and the threats are diverse, constantly changing, and sometimes completely unpredictable? An increasingly globalized and networked society requires a new approach to survival. We need to reclaim a basic arsenal of lost skills, learn how to find our way in situations where there are no street signs or satellite signals, and be prepared to counter modern threats. We must remember that the line between peace and war is thin and it can be crossed in an instant. In such a situation, everyone must be ready to ‘fight’ for their survival. Although the world around us sometimes seems quite tame, we need to be aware that nature is powerful and unpredictable. Only those who have the knowledge and skills can survive a disaster situation. The world may sometimes seem calm, without cataclysms or hostilities, however, you can still easily find yourself in a situation where you have become separated from civilization. This can happen if you go on a trip to an exotic country, go camping or go hiking through a forest. These are seemingly normal, harmless things that people do all the time, however, you can easily find yourself in an unfavorable situation where there is a lack of food, communications, medical care, transport or you experience bad weather, a loss of equipment, loneliness, etc. Most often this happens when ordinary residents of cities, towns, southern steppe regions find themselves in the forest. It would seem that nothing unusual - many people go to the forest for berries and mushrooms or just take a walk. However, until now, despite all the achievements of civilization, people, getting not into the park, but into the forest, often find themselves in conditions unfamiliar to them and unsuitable for their habitation. Experienced people know exactly what to do and how to behave in such situations however if you are inexperienced, it can lead to tragic consequences, sometimes even in places close to food and housing. It is important to learn how"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"to confront life-threatening events and situations and how to behave rationally in an extreme environment. It is difficult to give advice that can be applied to all scenarios, since every life-threatening situation, the people who fall into them and their reactions are different. Therefore, only general recommendations can be made for how to survive unforeseen adverse situations. How to be ready if you lose access to doctors, hospitals and pharmacies? In extreme conditions, when survival is necessary, knowledge of plants and natural medicine is extremely important. Natural medicine is the experience of our ancestors. Our ancestors understood nature and knew how to harness its healing properties. One of the advantages of traditional medicine is the reliability of the ingredients and methods that it uses. This is confirmed by centuries and even millennia of their use in practice. The knowledge that has been passed down from generation to generation for centuries has been improved and expanded upon, so now we, in the modern world, can confidently implement it. What is Natural Medicine? According to the definition provided by the World Health Organization (WHO), natural medicine is the sum of knowledge, skills, and practices based on the experiences of indigenous peoples from different cultures. In many countries, “traditional medicine,” is often referred to as “complementary” or “alternative” medicine. The WHO created the Traditional Medicine Strategy 2014-2023 to regulate, research, and harness natural medicine and ensure the safety of its use. Practices such as Ayurveda, Traditional Chinese Medicine, Unani, Anthroposophic Medicine, Chiropractic, Homeopathy, Naturopathy and Osteopathy enjoy global popularity. Nowadays, more than 100 million Europeans use traditional medicine methods. Even more people trust and rely on traditional medicine in Africa, Asia, Australia, and North America. There is undoubtedly a growing trend towards implementing natural treatments made from herbs, minerals and animal products. Modern medicine is increasingly turning to natural methods of treatment, which many scientists"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"previously did not recognize or approve of. Below is a breakdown of some of the most common types of alternative medicine: •  Phytotherapy: This refers to treatment using medicinal herbs. Infusions of various plants and herbs are believed to have a beneficial effect on the functioning of the whole body, they are said to cleanse the vital organs and blood of toxins and increase the immunological functions of the body without detrimental side effects on the organs. •  Urine therapy: This is the external or internal use of human or animal urine for therapeutic purposes; modern medicine considers this method to be dangerous due to the possibility of poisoning and the spread of infection. • Aromatherapy: This is the treatment of ailments with essential oils. • Homeopathy: This is an approach to treating illness which involves the use of minimal doses of substances that cause, in large doses, phenomena similar to the symptoms of the disease. • Treatment with minerals. • Sound therapy. • Acupuncture. • Naturotherapy: This is the treatment of illness with medicines of natural, mineral, plant or animal origin. • Apitherapy: This is the treatment of ailments with honey. • Manual therapy: This is a set of biomechanical techniques performed by hand, aimed at eliminating pain and restoring mobility of the spine and joints. • Hirudotherapy: The application of leeches to the skin. • Bioenergy therapy: The treatment of illness with the help of biological energy. • Hydrotherapy: This is the use of water for preventive and therapeutic purposes in the form of local and general baths, rubdowns, showers, body wraps, compresses and douches. • Stone therapy: A massage technique using various natural stones • Hunger therapy. • Color treatment."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"• Magnetotherapy: This is a treatment that uses pulsed magnetic fields. • Diet treatment: The following of a certain diet e.g., carbohydrate-free diet, separate meals, protein-free diet, etc. to treat a condition. • Metal therapy: This involves the attaching of metal plates to the body. Over the course of history, knowledge of traditional medicine has been passed on both orally and through writing. Traditional oral medicine came about at the dawn of humankind, when medical knowledge was passed from mouth to mouth, from generation to generation. Traditional written medicine came about with the advent of class societies and writing, when the medical knowledge of the people began to be recorded and consolidated in handwritten and then printed sources. In the traditional oral medicine of pre-class societies, two types of folk medical knowledge can be distinguished: “household,” the bearer of which is every person, every family, as well as “professional.” The professionals were people closely associated with religious and magical activities: healers, sorcerers, midwives, herbalists, etc. The main source of medical knowledge, of course, has always been popular mass experience, although the “professionals” also possessed some specific knowledge that was inherited over the generations. The daily practice of the healer also contributed to the formation of medical knowledge. Before choosing the right plant, the healer repeatedly tested its effect on themselves. The “professional” type of traditional oral medical knowledge is the basis of traditional written medicine. Along with “traditional oral” and “traditional written” medicine, there was also “professional scientific medicine,” which had a constant impact on household, everyday medical knowledge and on the non- professional medical practice of the people. In turn, scientific medicine still, to some degree, coexists with traditional types of folk medical knowledge and, despite the dominant position of scientific medicine, folk medical practice continues to play an important role in maintaining the health of certain ethnicities, communities and cultures, especially those who live in very rural areas. Because of this, the medical knowledge of ethnic groups cannot be reduced only to the concept of “folk medicine,” because at present, the nature of traditional folk knowledge is determined not so much by traditional medicine but rather by scientific medicine. From this, the specificity of medical folk knowledge of the modern ethnic group is formed. Therefore, the use of the term “folk medicine” to refer to the totality of all types of everyday medicine, associated with both traditional oral and traditional written medicine, as well as traditional scientific medicine, is becoming wider. "},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"The 2 biggest advantages of traditional medicine are outlined below: 1.  Effectiveness: proper nutrition, herbal decoctions, tinctures and recipes for the proper preparation and storage of various products can lead to very effective results. 2.  Only environmentally friendly ingredients are used: the famous saying of Confucius is true: “Your medicine should be food, and your food should be medicine,” while most modern drugs have many contraindications and side effects. Natural medicine is especially extremely important for survival in extreme conditions, when access to conventional medicine and even emergency services is completely absent. Once in such an environment, you seem to find yourself in past centuries, in the circumstances in which people of that time lived. Knowledge of natural medicine is especially important for survival in extreme conditions, when access to conventional medicine and emergency services is completely cut off. In some parts of the world, many people do not have access to modern medicine, for example, the lack of roads in sub-Saharan Africa makes it very difficult to supply essential medical equipment. What should you do if you need medical assistance, and you find yourself in such a situation? You will benefit from knowledge of natural medicine and the potential of medicinal herbs. This will most likely save your life. Remember, survival techniques can also be applied to certain situations in modern civilization.  "},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" Understanding Herbs The ancient Greeks distinguished between doctors and rhizotomes (riza – “root,” tome – “cut”). The rhizotomes collected and procured medicines and the doctors treated patients. In those days, there was already a distinct gap between those who created and nurtured new drugs, and those who prescribed them. Over the centuries, this gap has become more and more marked. Over the centuries, this contradiction has become more and more aggravated. Those who created drugs praised them in every possible way, but those who introduced them accepted them with all sorts of expressions of delight, which almost always grew into distrust. The famous French doctor Yushar published the book Therapy in 20 Remedies; the school of the ‘luminary’ of European medicine - the Austrian pathologist K. Rokitansky - preached pharmacotherapeutic nihilism, and the outstanding Russian pharmacologist Yu. K. Trapp noted in one of his lectures: “My friends, you should know that all the means that really help suffering humanity can be written on the nail bed of your thumb.” Ancient civilizations, having established close relationships with their natural environment, studied the nuances of the effects of plants on humans. Their findings have proven incredibly valuable to the world of modern medicine. Observation is the cornerstone of medicine! For example, the Australian Aborigines used plants containing saponins to hunt fish. These plants were smashed with a stone on the shore and thrown into the water, where even at a dilution of 1:1,000,000 they reliably killed fish, which the natives then easily caught and ate without any consequences. The secret is simple: saponins are poison only when they enter the bloodstream directly (in fish this happens through the gill slits), while in the human digestive tract saponins are harmless: when they enter the body through the mouth, they do not pose a threat. Later, it was noticed that saponins facilitate sputum discharge in pulmonary diseases - this is how"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"medicine received expectorant drugs. An important aspect of interest in folk remedies is the ease of obtaining a drug - it is almost always at hand. Traditional medicine has another positive quality: the ‘softness’ of the impact on the patient, which modern remedies do not have. The origins of widely accepted natural medicine lead to Galen. Both the triumphs and defeats of modern medicine began with Galen. Ancient doctors mainly used natural remedies- medicines, so to speak, of natural origin. Galen took a different path; he was drawn to the idea of isolating and implementing a single therapeutic element from a plant. Plants, according to Galen, have two parts: one has a therapeutic effect on the sick organism, while the other is simply useless or even harmful. Medical thought enthusiastically followed the theory put forward by Galen. The famous and most characteristic example of this theory in practice is the case of Dr. Whithering. In 1775, a young doctor at a public hospital in Shropshire, England, was asked to give his opinion on an old family recipe. An old woman had healed people with this recipe, and more than once she managed to help in cases where certified doctors could not help. The recipe included about twenty herbs. Dr. Whithering posited that the main active ingredient in the recipe was foxglove. The isolation of this one element from the recipe led to the discovery of a refined targeting agent - digitoxin. The use of poorly processed natural remedies by ancient healers was not only the result of primitive technology, but also an expression of certain medical and pharmacological concepts. Let us illustrate this idea with a recipe from the monograph by V. M. Salo Plants and Medicine: The author of this recipe was a simple Bulgarian peasant Ivan Raev from Shipka. Raev sent small cardboard boxes to his patients, in them were several pieces of some kind of roots and a bag of black powder. No one knew what the ingredients were since Raev kept the composition of his remedy secret. The Italian Queen Elena paid Raev 4 million lire for his recipe. It turned out that the composition of the remedy included dried belladonna and calamus roots, animal charcoal and balls of dough flavored with nutmeg. To prepare the medicine, it was necessary to boil 30 g of belladonna roots for 10 minutes with 600 g of white wine, to which animal charcoal was also added. After cooling, the decoction should be filtered and taken in certain doses. The powder was taken a few hours after the first remedy was taken, and in between doses a calamus rhizome was sucked for a long time, believed to relieve dry mouth. Thus, the therapeutically active part of this medicinal composition, in fact, was belladonna roots, since the consumption of the powder was, most likely, just a ritual. An interesting fact is that in the process of boiling and filtering through animal charcoal, the"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"alkaloids that passed from belladonna root into wine were partially destroyed and partially absorbed by the animal charcoal. And, despite this, the filtrate, according to the doctors of that time, had a good therapeutic effect, much better than the use of pure atropine. The use of plants for the treatment of diseases and the promotion of health began in ancient times. Even primitive people learned how to harness the medicinal properties of nature. Information about the healing properties of plants was passed down from generation to generation, and how people used these plants is evidenced by references in ancient myths, legends, and tales. Medicinal plants were repeatedly glorified even in poetic form. For example, the 10th century poem “Odo of Mena” describes the medicinal properties of more than 100 medicinal plants. The saying of the medieval scientist, philosopher and physician Avicenna is also world famous: “The doctor has three weapons: the word, the plant, the knife.” Almost five hundred thousand species of plants are known to exist, of which only about 290 plants are referenced in the atlas of medicinal plants, which does not mean to say that the rest of the plants are devoid of healing properties. An old legend tells how a healer sent his student off into the forest tasked with finding and bringing back a completely useless plant, but the student could not complete the teacher's task, because he did not find a single useless plant. As the American philosopher R. Emerson wrote, “any weed is a medicinal plant, the merits of which have not yet been revealed.” Any plant is given to us by nature for the good, and the task of a human is to correctly understand its purpose. The researchers found that the peoples of the ancient world used up to 21 thousand plant species. Already at the earliest stages of human development, plants were not only a source of food for people, but they helped people overcome injury, illness and disease. The oldest medical treatise is a tablet found during excavations of a Sumerian city (3rd century BC). There are 15 recipes in 145 lines in Sumerian. The culture and knowledge of the ancient Sumerians were inherited by the Babylonians, who used licorice root, henbane, flaxseed, etc. for medicinal purposes. The Babylonians noticed that sunlight had a negative effect on the healing properties of some plants, so they dried them in the shade, and some herbs were even collected at night. Plants were widely used in China, India, Tibet. Back in 3216 BC, Chinese Emperor Sheen Nong wrote a work on medicine called Ben Cao (Herbalist), which mainly described herbal remedies. Chinese medicine has used over 1,500 plants. Ancient Indian medicine, set forth in Ayurveda (1st century BC), used about 800 plants, all of"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"which are still used today. Tibetan medicine originated from Indian medicine, and the Zhud Shi treatise on Tibetan medicine has a large section on the use of medicinal plants. Tibetan (Indo-Tibetan) medicine became famous in Russia, spreading through Mongolia and Buryatia when Buddhist monasteries became centers of cultural and medical education. In addition to imported plants, Siberian llamas used various substitutes from the local flora for medicinal purposes. Such plants were included in the medical practice of the population, and some of them later became the property of traditional medicine (burnet officinalis, aconite, cloves, gentians, rhododendrons, etc.). From the practice of llama healers, modern scientific medicine has included such medicinal plants as thermopsis, thick-leaved bergenia, Baikal skullcap. Interest in the methods and means of Tibetan medicine is not waning today. More than 700 species of medicinal plants of Transbaikalia used by Tibetan medicine represent an extensive field of activity for modern researchers of the medicinal properties of plants. In the Eber Papyrus, dating back to the 6th century BC, the Egyptians collected more than 900 recipes for herbal treatment of various diseases. The action of herbal medicines is determined by the active substances contained in various parts of the plant: alkaloids, glycosides, tannins, essential oils, and others. It cannot be said that herbal preparations completely replace synthetic medicines, but in our time phytotherapy (treatment with medicinal plants) is experiencing a rebirth. With the advent of writing, information about the beneficial properties of plants began to be recorded, which greatly expanded their practical use. Herbal treatment was especially widespread in Egypt, Greece, India, and China. A lot of interesting information about the medicinal use of plants was recorded in the works of ancient thinkers and doctors: Hippocrates, Dioscorides, Pliny, Galen, etc. Unfortunately, archaeological excavations have not been able to reveal to us the medicinal plants of antiquity, some of which have long since become extinct. However, the sculptural works and the first written documents of India and China, as well as the long-vanished civilizations of the Middle East and Egypt, testify to the use of plants for medicinal purposes. Interesting information about the use of the healing properties of plants can be found in the monuments and artefacts of ancient cultures - Sanskrit, Hebrew, Chinese, Greek, Roman. Extensive material written about the use of medicinal plants (“Books of the preparation of"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"medicines for all parts of the body”) was discovered in the 19th century by the German Egyptologist Georg Ebers. It contains a number of recipes that the ancient Egyptians used to treat many diseases. They used various ointments, lotions, potions, many of which had a rather complex composition. In Egypt, fragrant oils, balms, and resins were widespread. At that time, the healing properties of aloe, plantain, juniper, castor oil and many other plants were already well known. In the oldest library in the world - the library of the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal in Nineveh (about 660 BC) - clay tablets written in cuneiform also contain extensive information about medicinal plants. Along with a description of each plant, there was information about the diseases they helped treat and in what form they should be used. In ancient Chinese medicine, references to many human diseases can be found. The collection of medicinal plants and various remedies of Li Shi Zhen (1522–1596) “Fundamentals of Pharmacognosy” is widely known. In it, a detailed description of several medicinal remedies from medicinal plants is given. Doctors of ancient India believed that most diseases come from the spoilage of “body juices,” therefore, alongside herbal remedies, bloodletting and emetics were commonly recommended as treatments, Many Indian plants (especially spices) were imported into the Roman Empire, thus, various Indian plants have long been a part of European medical practice including chilibuga and rauwolfia, etc. “If you look around with the eyes of a doctor looking for medicines, you can say that we live in a world of medicines,” says one of the precepts of ancient Buddhist medicine. An outstanding representative of the Arab medical school, Tajik scientist, Abu Ali Ibn Sina (Avicenna), whose millennium in 1980 was celebrated by the entire progressive world, wrote the famous book The Canon of Medical Science in five volumes. It has been translated into many languages and in the Middle Ages was a reference book for Arab and European doctors. In his book, Avicenna described about 900 species of medicinal plants, many of which originated from India and other Asian countries and were not used in the ancient Mediterranean countries. Scientific folk medicine begins its development since the time of the famous Greek physician Hippocrates (460–377 BC). In his medical practice, he used numerous herbal preparations. A number of them were apparently borrowed from Egyptian medicine. Hippocrates described 236 plant species recognized by ancient Greek medicine as medicinal products which he used without processing."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Hippocrates believed that medicinal plants in raw form and in the form of juices have the best effect on the human body. The ancient Greek physician wrote that “medicine is the art of imitating the healing effects of nature.” The first edition of a really significant book on medicine belongs to the ancient Roman physician Aulus Cornelius Celsus (end of the 1st century BC - beginning of the 1st century AD). In eight books On Medicine, he summarized all the medical literature of his time: from the ancient Indian physician Sushruta to the works of Asklepiades. In this work, much attention is given to medicinal plants. It describes the methods used to treat various diseases and gives recommendations on the use of several plants. In the writings of Celsus, one can find not only botanical descriptions of plantain, poppy, cumin, wine berries, but also their practical applications. In the middle of the first century AD, the doctor of the Roman army in Asia, Dioscorides, compiled an extensive herbal book, which includes most of the medicinal plants known by that time - about 500 species. The author of the new doctrine of medicinal plants was the aforementioned famous physician and pharmacist of ancient Rome, Claudius Galen (129-201 AD). He wrote about 200 works on medicine. Of greatest importance are his two herbalism books, which describe more than 300 herbal remedies. The author was one of the first known proponents of obtaining drugs from plant materials and creating tinctures, extracts, and other natural treatments. Now they are called galenical preparations and still have not lost their great practical importance. The active ingredient is drawn to liquid so it is easy to separate it from the rest of the plant material. To do this, the medicinal plant should be infused or boiled with water, wine or vinegar. Galen introduced the technology for obtaining such dosage forms as tinctures and extracts. Extracts from medicinal plants quickly gained popularity in all European countries. Galen had his own pharmacy in Rome, where he himself prepared medicines for the sick. He manufactured powders, pills, ointments, plasters as well as mustard plasters. In the 4th century, the most famous of the Latin herbalism books was compiled by Apuleius. The herbal collection book was so popular that when printing was invented, it was the first medical book to be printed. In the 9th and 10th centuries, the first translations of the herbalists Dioscorides, Galen and Apuleius appeared into European languages - Italian, French, English, German. European herbalism books appeared later, in the 15th and 16th centuries, but the"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"information given in them is largely borrowed from the Greek and Latin herbalists. The Black Sea coast was once famous for its medicinal herbs. Hippocrates, having visited, wrote about excellent medicines from the Scythian root (rhubarb), Pontic absinthia (wormwood), oily root (calamus), etc. In his writings, the ancient Greek philosopher and naturalist Theophrastus (372–287 BC) repeatedly mentions Scythian grass, which was widely used to treat wounds. In ancient Rus, the use of plants for medicinal purposes was reflected in the remarkable artefact of ancient Russian culture Izbornik Svyatoslav (1073). In this manuscript, much space is devoted to describing the plants that were used at that time to obtain medicines. For the treatment of internal and external diseases in Rus, they turned to the application and ingestion of plants (for example, they applied cabbage, flax, mustard, hazel or drank their juices). Along with herbal medicines, the Rus people have used honey in medical practice since ancient times. It was prescribed in its pure form and in mixtures with a decoction of herbs, with oil, vinegar, lard, beer, baked onions, and many other substances. In addition to books on herbalism and books on healing, knowledge of plants and their medicinal preparations became widespread. In addition to normal books on herbalism and books on healing, the Rus created the so-called “vertograds” with numerous descriptions of plants and their medicinal preparations became widespread. “This book is referred to as a cool vertograd or medical treatment book of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker” (“Cool Vertograd”) is one of the fairly common ancient Rus medical practitioners. It is a translation of a very popular Western European medical encyclopedia of the 15th-16th centuries. The text of the vertograds has changed over time. They described rational empirical remedies from herbs, trees, and minerals. Since ancient times, it has been believed that there is no plant that would not be curative, and there is no disease that could not be cured by a plant! Medicinal herbs were popular among the inhabitants of Armenia and Georgia. With the adoption of Christianity and the emergence of monasteries, the use of medicinal plants expanded significantly. The monks, using information from Greek herbalists, used not only imported dried herbs, but also local plants. The principles and methods of ancient herbal medicine or alternative medicine are essential to"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"survival medicine after all, “nothing can be more erroneous than discarding the past that served to achieve the present” (L.I. Herzen). Therapy based on the use of drugs of natural origin has more ancient roots -- until the beginning of the 19th century, drugs were mainly known and widely used, which are raw or, at best, relatively simply processed products of plant, animal, or mineral origin. Plants have been used for medicinal purposes by all the peoples of the world since time immemorial. In ancient China, 2700 years BC, rhubarb, ergot, ginseng, opium were used; in ancient Egypt over 1500 BC, they knew about the healing effect of castor bean, mint, wormwood and sea onion. In Rome, as in Greece, medicinal plants were grown in special gardens. In the poetry of the Romans, the Greek tradition of dedicating laudatory epigrams to medicinal plants continued. Greek poet and healer Luxorius wrote: Among the gigantic buildings that raise the earth high, Marvelous is the garden; he is nice to the owner. Here life-giving herbs grow from various seeds; Their healing properties bring healing to us. Everything here science has for Phoebus with Asclepius, clearly Here, for any ailments, the remedy is open to you. I believe that the garden is a part of the sky where Gods rule: After all, it is given to herbs to conquer death itself. Descriptions of gardens with medicinal plants among the ancient Romans were contained in popular books and encyclopedias. This ancient tradition was continued in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. The poem Hortulus Animae (“Garden of the Soul,” 1483), describes medicinal plants grown in a monastery garden, was very famous among contemporaries. In one of the fragments from the “Regimen sanitatis Salernitanum” (“Salerno Code of Health,” 1480), it talks of the cultivation of medicinal plants in the medical school of Salerno: Sage strengthens the nerves and calms the trembling of the hands, And it is able to expel even an acute fever. You are our savior, sage, and helper, given by nature. "},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" Plants are also associated with many legends and beliefs. Thus, the family to which the centaury belongs was called Chironia, derived from the name of the Centaur Chiron, who was known in Greek mythology for his knowledge of medicinal herbs, which he then transferred to the healer Asclepius and Patroclus (Homer’ Iliad IV 219; XI 832). Mention of the centaury can also be found in the book Le Petit Albert - a guide to magic and cabalism, published for the first time in 1668. It mentions fifteen magical herbs, among which there is the centaury. No matter how far back we go in time, we won’t find a culture that didn’t know about the healing properties of plants - the number one panacea. Plants became the first medicinal form. The ancient people were very observant, because there were no books yet, and one could only depend on oneself and one's own experience. The invigorating property of coffee, for example, was discovered by goats! Any animal, having fallen ill, looks for the herb necessary for healing - instinct plays the role of a doctor here. The ancient people were very observant, because there were no books and authorities yet, and one had to believe only in oneself and one's own experience. An Ethiopian monk who herded them noticed that goats that had eaten coffee beans became excessively mischievous and their excitement lasted all night long. Thanks to this hint, the shepherd was able to successfully carry out the night vigil. Soon his secret became the common knowledge within the monastery, and then, with the speed of an epidemic, spread throughout the world. The ancient Greeks attributed the discovery of the laxative effect of cheremitsa to the centaur Chiron, who, they say, was the first to notice how they get rid of constipation in herds. The anthelmintic action of fly agaric was discovered by deer hunters. They noticed that fungi caused animals to have an accelerated bowel movement with the release of stunned parasites. An ancient Egyptian medical document, the Eber papyrus, mentions the medicinal use of pomegranate, saffron, and dates. Egyptian doctors used dill as a remedy for headaches, horseradish as an emetic, and poppy - as a remedy for pain. Lentil soup was used to treat urolithiasis: peas soaked in vinegar were used for lotions. Ancient Tibetan doctors used rice as a remedy, drawing this knowledge from the practice of doctors in ancient China. The ways of trade and war were at the same time the ways of spreading medical knowledge. Being an element of culture, they, like geographical, military, literary, historical and other knowledge, they were influenced and mutually enriched. The first “conquerors of the Universe” - the Assyrian kings - unwittingly served the progress of medicine, capturing on clay tablets not only their bragging and cruelty, but also the recipes for"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"medicinal recipes of enslaved peoples. Thanks to the deciphering of these tablets, today we know a lot about the medicine of peoples whose history is buried in the sands. In the capital of Assyria, Nineveh, there was a garden where medicinal plants grew - apparently, this is the first reproduction of medicinal raw materials known to man. The conquistadors who conquered the empires of the Incas and Aztecs brought to Europe not only gold and precious stones, but also the secret of curing malaria with cinchona bark. This secret became the property of the Jesuit order. Cromwell, ill with malaria, refused the “Jesuit potion” and died. For a lot of money, the secret was bought by Louis XIV to heal his son. When the prince recovered, the king of France ordered the recipe to be made public. Known since ancient times, the recipe for the anthelmintic male fern was gradually forgotten, and in the end, the widow of the Swiss doctor Nuffer turned out to be the only person who knew the recipe. Louis XVI in 1775 bought the recipe for a lot of money, and since then the fern has been included in all European pharmacopoeias. However, the main role in the search for and preservation of grains of knowledge did not belong to the rulers. At all times and among all peoples, scientists have been doing this. One of the oldest medical treatises, Ayurveda, compiled over the centuries by the great ancient Indian doctors - Atreya, Charaka and Sushruta - is still a reference book for Indian doctors today. Many probably know the choleretic drug - LIV 52, but few know that it was made according to an ancient Ayurvedic recipe. In ancient Tibetan medicine, long before modern science, it was already known that a person can have a predisposition to cancer, that he may not get sick, the disease manifests itself due to various contributing factors. They knew that cancer is an expression of the disease of the whole organism, therefore the basis of its treatment was the effect of medicinal preparations on the organism as a whole, and not the surgical path of therapy. The beauty of the scientific thought of the East is difficult for a European because of its poetically associative expression. The East worships the variability and diversity of the world and reflects this in a multi-layered complex text, the key to which is jealously kept by Teachers, monasteries, and centuries. “When the king falls ill, the dignitaries suffocate, and the nobles sweat all over.” This is an example of a description of cardiopulmonary insufficiency, where the king is the heart; dignitaries are lungs, in the pulmonary circulation of which, in case of insufficiency of the pumping function of the heart, increased pressure and stagnation develop, and nobles are"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"edematous joints. In the treatment of this pathology, the patient had to be given a “fever bird” (as it was possible to establish, a twelve-component medicine), put her on a “horse” and give her a “scourge”. It turned out that the “horse” is a four-component medicine that facilitates the access of the main agent to the points of application, and the “scourge” is a laxative that helps to remove the “heat bird” and “horse” from the patient's body. The oldest pharmacopoeia of the world is the herbal book of the Chinese emperor Sheen Nong “Ben Cao,” compiled in the III millennium BC. It lists the healing properties of about 900 medicinal and poisonous plants. Thanks to Chinese pharmacy, the world has learned about ginseng, eleutherococcus, lemongrass, and other biostimulants that are both effective and gentle to the body. The successors of Sheen nun's works have expanded the idea of what a medicine can be. In the pharmacopoeia of Li Si Zheng (1518-1593), there were already 1892 medicinal plants. With the beginning of travel along the “Great Arc” (the path from Ancient Egypt to Punt), the countries of the Mediterranean basin began to be enriched with knowledge not only of the East, but also with the finds of the African savannahs, jungles and deserts. The secrets of the Ngombo, Niang, Mbunga, and other exotic tribes have yet to be revealed and deciphered in full! Thus, for Africans, the problem of preventing conception and regulating population has not been insoluble for a long time, the therapy of many conditions is more effective than the action of our powerful resuscitation with its abundance of super-powerful means refined by the modern chemical industry. Some effective methods of healers of the primitive tribes of America, Oceania, and other regions have not been studied either. In Efremov’s novel “On the Edge of the Oikumene,” there are such lines: “This medicine is no worse than magic grass from the blue steppe. In the hour of illness, fatigue, or grief, let him crush it and drink the decoction, just a little. If you drink a lot, it is no longer a medicine, but a poison. This bark restores strength to the elderly, amuses the oppressed, invigorates the weakened.” These words are spoken about a thousand years before our era, and it is about the bark of the mohimba tree from the moraine family, which also includes cinchona and coffee trees. The more active the exchange of goods between countries became and the more communications and means of transportation developed, the faster the establishment of pharmacopoeias in the universal culture took place. Hellas, which stood at the crossroads of communications, became a kind of accumulator of the cultures of many civilizations - Phoenicia, Ancient Egypt, the"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Caucasus, Crete, India. It gave the world the founder of scientific medicine - Hippocrates. In those days, herb collectors or rhizotomes kept away from the mass of healers. The records they left were devoid of systematization and general clinical concept. The first to combine disparate collections - rhizotomy -was Theophrastus, one of the first botanists of antiquity, a student and friend of Aristotle. Even then it became clear that the purpose of the philosopher is to link together the disparate knowledge obtained by artisans. But clinical, practical pharmacognosy originates from Dioscorides (I century), who systematized all known remedies. As we can see, the use of medicinal plant materials and drugs has a long history, much longer than the history of the use of synthetic drugs - products of chemical synthesis and biological preparations. However, does this mean that phytopreparations, being more studied, safer and better tolerated due to their natural origin (whereas, according to the majority, drugs of a chemical nature are alien to the human body, and many of them are completely absent in nature) are also equally as effective as synthetic drugs? Opportunities in the treatment of diseases that have opened up for medicine in connection with advances in chemical synthesis have practically left the study of the mechanisms of action of phytotherapeutic agents and the study of their safety behind. After Well, thanks to chemical synthesis, it became possible to obtain drugs with specified physicochemical (for example, solubility) and pharmacological properties, to ensure standardization and high purity, the absence of any ballast substances, not to mention the relatively quick ability to synthesize the necessary substance in the right quantities, as well as the most important thing - the opportunity to receive preparations with exactly established and reproducible content of active agents and excipients every time. Alas, in the case of phytopreparations, it is quite difficult to comply with most of the above criteria, especially in extreme conditions, without measuring tools. The chemical composition of wild-growing medicinal plants is, as a rule, quite complex and the active components contained in it are often unknown or partially known and not fully understood. In addition, many of these components are naturally occurring and chemically unstable. The content of active and ballast substances varies significantly not only depending on the type of plant, but also on external factors - the place of growth, the chemical composition of soils, temperature and humidity, the characteristics of the harvesting of this raw material (for example, time of day), drying conditions, processing, and storage (e.g., temperature and humidity) and much more. To assess the quality of phytopreparations, it is also necessary to classify the medicinal plants included in it, in particular, to determine their type and variety, take into account the parts of the plant used, consider the presence of impurities (heavy metals, aflatoxins and fumigants, residual amounts of"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"pesticides, possible radioactivity of the raw materials used), which is quite laborious, time consuming and costly. In addition, when obtaining herbal remedies of a complex composition, it becomes even more difficult to take into account how compatible the components of different medicinal plants are in general and to predict the likelihood of chemical, physicochemical and pharmacological incompatibilities. It is very difficult for traditional phytopreparations to be implemented in a standardized highly reproducible way. Consequently, the appearance, organoleptic properties and, most importantly, the composition, and hence the effectiveness of such drugs will differ significantly. As a result, this makes it much more difficult to bring phytopreparations under the framework of evidence- based medicine and, by and large, is the reason for classifying them as medicines with debatable effectiveness. However, what evidence-based medicine does not fully recognize has already been tried countless times by survival medicine, with great success at healing and saving lives. What about herbal medicines? Herbal medicines went neglected for a long time by the official modern regulatory processes. This has led to herbal companies specializing in the production of phytopreparations to develop their own mechanisms for standardizing such products. So, some standardized herb St. John's wort by the content of hypericin, which for a long time was considered the main active component of this plant. Later, other companies adopted another substance as a marker - hyperforin, which, as it turned out, also has an antidepressant effect; others have used the measurement of both these ingredients, hypericin and hyperforin, as markers of potency. In some countries, standards have been developed regarding the quality, efficacy and safety of medicinal plant materials and herbal remedies. One of these is, for example, the German system called Commission E. In the USA in 2004, from the first years of 21st century, research in the field of phytotherapy has significantly intensified. Thus, there was a significant number of scientific papers listed in the Medline database of the National Library of Medicine of the United States containing the word “phytotherapy” between the years 1990-2007. Thus, the total number of scientific papers listed in the Medline database of the National Library of Medicine of the United States containing the word “phytotherapy” in 1990-2007 was evidently increasing. As of April 2010, this number was already 21,213 sources. The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine of the United States at the National Institutes of Health of the United has begun funding clinical trials of herbal medicines. The medical community and the patients themselves are becoming increasingly aware of the fact that herbal medicine is the oldest method of treating various diseases. It existed long before the advent of pharmacology. Pharmacology is a fairly young science, it originated in the middle of"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"the 19th century. However, this does not mean that people did not fight diseases before - they simply used plants for this. Information about their healing properties was mentioned in the writings of Ebers as early as the second millennium BC. The greatest contribution to the development of herbal treatment methods was made by: • Sushruta - the author of Ayurvedic treatises; • Hippocrates - made an attempt to systematize knowledge about medicinal plants; • Li Shi-Zhen - the author of the first Chinese pharmacopoeia; • Galen – compiler of the first ointment and tincture recipes; • Paracelsus - the first to use alcohol extracts from plants for medical purposes. Today, the approach to therapy has changed, but from time-to-time people turn to natural medicines, especially when there are no other options. Within the framework of phytotherapy, the following methods are practiced: •  Ingestion: (usually drinking) for several millennia, recipes have been created for almost all occasions, so it is difficult to indicate the scope of drinking herbal remedies. •  External application (hot poultices, cold compresses, ointments). Used for dermatological, fungal diseases and for the treatment of injuries. •  Inhalations: used for diseases of the respiratory system, to facilitate the discharge of sputum and to relieve bronchospasm. •  Douching: focused on women suffering from gynecological diseases. •  Microclysters: they help in cases of inflammation of the mucous membrane of the rectum, dysbacteriosis, hemorrhoids. Injections and intravenous infusions are not practiced as part of phytotherapy. On the one hand, it is unsafe, on the other hand, it does not correspond to the natural ethos of approach. There are thousands of recipes. If you group them, you can distinguish the main forms of natural"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"medicines: •  Decoction: raw plant material is harvested (roots, bark, less often - branches) and soaked in a water bath for at least half an hour. The mix is then cooled, strained, and used within two days if stored in an airtight container. •  Infusion. Soft raw plant material is harvested (leaves, stems, buds, flowers) and poured into already boiled water (the temperature depends on the recipe). The product needs to stand at room temperature for an average of 4 hours. After making it you can keep it for no more than a day. •  Alcohol tincture: raw plant material is poured with alcohol or vodka, and the container is placed in a dark place. The tincture is used in small doses, and the base allows you to store it for a long time. •  Ointment: raw plant material is crushed, mixed with a fatty base (vaseline, butter) and boiled over low heat. •  Plant extract: active substances are obtained by water-glycerin or oil maceration. Phytopreparations are selected according to various criteria. Some people are guided by well- known recipes and indications for their use, while others - by the availability of suitable ingredients. In recent years, people have shown an increased interest in herbal preparations. Their chemical nature is much closer to the human body, they are usually less toxic and less likely to cause allergic reactions than synthetic drugs. Over the centuries, mankind has gained considerable experience and knowledge of using phytopreparations, and when used correctly, herbal preparations have less side effects than synthetic ones, and there is no danger of developing an addiction or suffering an allergic reaction. Plants are active against many strains of microorganisms that have already acquired resistance to antibiotics, and are thus able to enhance human immunity to diseases. However, it should be noted that plant medicine is only beneficial with competent and correct use. Unfortunately, many people believe that phytotherapy is completely safe and that it can be used without restrictions and medical supervision. But such carelessness is dangerous. It should always be remembered that among medicinal plants, even among widely used ones, there are many poisonous ones. The beneficial or harmful effects of a plant can also vary depending on its dosage. Any drug, including a natural one, has both its indications and contraindications, and"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"when you exceed its recommended dose, its therapeutic effect is replaced by a toxic one. When using medicinal herbs for treatment it is best to be guided by a professional however, if you find yourself in a situation where this is not a possibility, make sure to always follow these guidelines: 1 . Accurately observe the dosage indicated in the prescription when mixing medicinal raw materials. 2 . Follow the rules for storing the prepared form. 3 . Strictly observe the dosage when taking the finished medicine. 4 . Carefully study the contraindications of all components included in concoction, and correlate them with the present diagnosis, as well as the patient's previous diseases. Of the almost three hundred species of medicinal plant, 250 species have passed pharmacological tests and have been officially recognized by modern medicine as suitable in the treatment of diseases. These plants are referred to as “pharmacopoeial” and are divided into three groups: • Effective: they are used in medicine; • Promising: their effectiveness has been proven, but there are obstacles to wide-spread application; • Potential: a pharmacological effect has been demonstrated, but it requires further research. Plants that fall into the first group are actively used in pharmacology along with synthetic drugs. Phytopreparations which use these plants are approved by doctors. In leaves, bark, buds, and other plant elements, there are substances that are of particular value: •  Alkaloids target the central nervous system, the cardiovascular system and also regulate blood pressure. •  Tannins have anti-inflammatory and hemostatic properties. •  Cardiotonic glycosides are useful for the heart; they improve blood flow, normalize pulse"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"and rhythm. •  Saponins reduce cholesterol levels, facilitate sputum discharge and have a laxative and diuretic effect. •  Bitterness normalizes the functions of the gastrointestinal tract and awakens appetite. •  Polysaccharides are used to relieve irritation of the respiratory and digestive tract. •  Fatty oils thin the blood, normalize the stool and protect the liver when taken orally. They can also be used as a base for healing ointments. They contain essential oils, resins, vitamins and minerals. Herbal preparations, made independently, can really help with many diseases. Although we are talking about alternative medicine, you can implement it using a scientific approach. If you systematically approach the preparation of a therapeutic regimen, you can get the desired results. The main scientific principles that phytotherapists adhere to are summarized below: • Use of small doses. This helps to control the reactions of the body. Doses can be increased gradually. • Gradual complication of composition. First, it is better to use single-component drugs to track their effect. Multi-component compositions are introduced over time – as you become familiar with individual ingredients. • Accounting for the time of day. Tonic plants should be taken in the morning, as they are invigorating. Infusions and decoctions should be used in the evening as they have a diuretic effect. • Reasonable combination. Herbs should be combined with each other and not harm other organs. This is why you need basic skills for survival medicine. Basic skills needed for survival medicine"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Two great threats to our survival lurk in our own brains: passive contemplation and the desire for comfort. If they are not sufficiently suppressed, they can lead to demoralization which can have fatal consequences in a survival situation. Luckily, both of these threats can be dealt with easily. The desire for comfort is a consequence of modern urban living conditions. Western standards have made people spoiled and pampered; we are protected from the forces of nature and the environment. Western people - perhaps including you, the reader - live and work in warm, comfortable, and secure buildings, with high-quality healthcare and a guaranteed supply of food and water. In an extreme situation, you probably won't have any of that, at least not at first. You will only have the clothes on your back, no food, no water, no shelter. The sudden disappearance of familiar comforts that you once used without thinking is in itself a big blow to your resolve and can lead to complete demoralization. Passive contemplation is also a consequence of communion with the benefits of civilization. A bureaucratic society saves a person from situations in which it is necessary to make life- critical decisions. Almost all the decisions we make are inconsequential and banal. Our initiative withers away, and most people descend into passive, sheepish contemplation. However, in an emergency situation, you will have to act quickly and rationally and make many tough decisions independently. The result of passivity or doing nothing, will very likely be your death. The alternative is to take control of the situation, you will have much greater chances of survival this way. The science of survival is old and well-established. Thanks to this science, human civilization was able to survive all catastrophes and disasters in order to reach the level of development in which we are now. Modern civilization has lost much of the knowledge and skills necessary for surviving in the wild. One of the main causes of death in a disaster situation is the low morale of the victim, which is directly related to the lack of the necessary special knowledge on autonomous survival. People are destroyed by lack of will and confusion, not the danger itself, but the fear of it. This book will allow those who find themselves in a difficult situation to gain confidence in the struggle for existence, reduce the strength and energy they exert and comfortably survive a disaster situation. The art of survival can be thought of as a pyramid, at the base of which there is the desire to stay alive. The next level is specialized knowledge. The next tier is the development of a sense of self-confidence which allows you to conquer your fear and think calmly in a critical situation. Equipment is at the top of the pyramid. By connecting all of these components of the pyramid together, you will be ready to take on any survival situation. However, often the necessary equipment and clothing for these conditions is not at hand. Then the struggle for"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"existence becomes extreme, on the verge of life and death. You will encounter obstacles and enemies to your survival and you must use adequate countermeasures against them. For example, pain is the language of your body; it tells you when something is wrong. It hinders you and can undermine your will to live. But it becomes much more bearable if you discover its source and nature and understand how you can get rid of it in the conditions in which you currently find yourself. You may also have chronic conditions such as asthma or diabetes. But even in the absence of insulin or asthma sprays, you can still effectively help yourself. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary for you to understand herbs, be able to effectively combine them, and select the correct ones to treat each particular health issue. You can and should use the plants and cereals growing around you, as well as other natural substances, in order to treat ailments if/when you find yourself in an extreme situation. Remember that a lot of the medicines you get in pharmacies are made from plants that grow around us. Infusions (extracts obtained by cold infusion) are usually made with the leaves or flowers, and broths (extracts obtained by boiling) - with the roots of plants. Following the dosage, drink infusions or broths preferably three times a day, and remember to make them using only freshly cut plants. Do not take natural medicine in larger doses than required - it will do more harm than good. Plants, herbs, essentials oil and remedies every survivalist should be aware of In nature, every plant is unique and has specific uses. Even the plants that look unremarkable can have medicinal properties that are superior in strength to modern medicines. There are many circumstances in which certified doctors recommend herbs and other natural medicine treatments to their patients. This is because herbal medicine is a simple and widely available method of healing. Medicinal herbs can effectively treat or alleviate even very serious diseases and they usually have much milder side effects on the body. At the same time, herbs have a powerful healing effect on the organs. If one of the readers is going to do herbal medicine, collecting or harvesting them, it will be very useful to familiarize yourself with the classification of medicinal plants. There are several types of natural treatment: decoctions, infusions, tinctures, ointments and powders. Infusions and decoctions are prepared simply: raw materials are steeped in boiling water. For a decoction, the raw materials must be boiled for 15 minutes over low heat or placed in a steam bath, more boiling water is then added. Decoction takes around 10 minutes while infusions take at least 45 minutes. The standard ratio of raw material to water is 1 tablespoon per"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"cup of boiling water. A medicinal herb with a particularly potent or toxic effect is added in the following ratio: 1 teaspoon to 1 cup of boiling water. A tincture is prepared by adding plant material to an alcohol, such as ethanol. The reason for preparing a tincture is because some medicinal herbs have more beneficial properties if they are added to an alcohol. Powders are prepared by drying and further grinding medicinal herbs. Powders can be prepared using only a small number of plant species. These are mainly roots (elecampane, calamus marsh, licorice). It is important to be aware that some plants are poisonous. This includes some members of the buttercup family (aconite, raven spiked) and the lily family (crow's eye, hellebore Lobel). Some plants of the celery family (spotted hemlock, poisonous milestones), the nightshade family (black henbane), and the poppy family (celandine) are also poisonous. The rose family is represented by plants that do not have a toxic effect on the human body. It includes: apricot, gravilates, pear, strawberry, stone berry, burnet, wild rose, apple tree and others. There are almost no contraindications to the use of this family of plants, except perhaps during pregnancy. The Aster family includes plants with a pronounced choleretic effect. These include wormwood, dandelion, calendula, immortelle, arnica, elecampane, chamomile, chicory. Medicinal plants containing cardiac glycosides should be used with caution. These include lily of the valley, hellebore and foxglove (digitalis). These plants have a beneficial effect on the heart and nervous system, but if the kidneys and liver function are deficient, they can be harmful. In general, each body is different, and, therefore, different reactions to different preparations of medicinal plants are possible. In addition, medicinal plants contain essential oils, saponins, glycosides, flavonoids and acids. Also, herbs may contain vitamins or vitamin-like substances, micro and macro elements, alkaloids, inulins, starches, tannins. All these can have powerful therapeutic effects. Remember that all medicinal plants must be prepared in specific ways. For many plants the underground parts should not be pulled out; the excavated plant is laid and the aerial part is cut off. The raw materials are shaken off the ground, cut into pieces and washed with running cold water. If there are a lot of raw materials, put it in a container, immerse it and take it out of the water, and in this way the raw materials are washed from the ground. Then the raw material is dried for 1-2 days and put to dry. When the roots and rhizomes break with a bang, drying is over. Marshmallow root for example, contains many polysaccharides, which determine the expectorant effect of the decoction when coughing. When interacting with water, polysaccharides swell and,"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"when dried, release water very slowly and poorly. The marshmallow root should first be thoroughly cleaned of earth and dirt. The above-ground part is cut off and thrown away. If possible, try not to wash the root. To speed up drying, cut the root lengthwise into 2-4 parts and across into pieces up to 35 cm long. If there is still a need for washing, wash the roots quickly in cold running water. Do not directly heat the root up as the polysaccharides will form a starch-like paste and it is almost impossible to dry the raw material. The roots can be dried in the sun: lay them out in a thin layer to speed up the process. Since they are so hygroscopic, care must be taken to prevent dew from falling on them. To determine when the root is finished drying, bend the root: if it breaks with a snap, it is ready but if it bends, continue the drying process. Roots that are not fully dried will become moldy in storage. The active substances in plants are not always found in the same place; in some plant species, medicinal substances accumulate in roots, rhizomes, tubers, bulbs, and other underground organs; in others - in leaves, stems, buds, bark, etc.; also, substances can be accumulated in flowers, fruits, seeds. In many plants, the medicinal raw material is either the entire aerial non-lignified part of the plant, or only the leafy shoots, or leaves alone. The active ingredients are most concentrated during the budding phase - the beginning of flowering. Usually, the lower leaves are plucked so that the remaining ones produce enough substances for flowering and fruiting. Thick and juicy petioles slow down drying, so they are removed. When collecting nettle leaves, the aerial part is first mowed, and when the leaves are withered and lose their pungency, they are processed. This is possible on continuous thickets of nettles. If there are none, cut off the lower leaves from each plant. The flowers are the most delicate part of a plant, so you should not pack them tightly in a container. It is best to collect them in baskets (if you have any) and try to deliver them to the drying place as soon as possible and begin drying them straight away. To dry them, lay the flowers out in a thin layer. After drying, place the flowers in a container (glass or metal) with a tight seal. It is important to dry the raw materials no later than 2-3 hours after collection. Different raw materials require different drying methods. Most types of medicinal raw materials are best dried in the shade, under a canopy. The quality of medicinal raw materials largely depends on drying them properly. Drying usually takes several days. Those in stranded in the wilderness can dry medicinal plants only in natural conditions, under which the collected raw materials are scattered in a thin layer on clean"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"plywood, cloth, cardboard, durable paper. During this period, the raw material must be turned and covered from rain and dew. To speed up drying, large roots, rhizomes, bulbs, tubers, and juicy fruits must first be crushed and then spread out in a thin layer. The drying process is considered complete when the leaves and flowers are easily rubbed in the hands, the stems and roots break easily, the berries, when squeezed in a handful, easily crumble, and do not stick together into a lump. To prevent the raw material from spoiling during storage, it is best to store them in plastic bags in a dry place. It is most expedient to prepare infusions, decoctions, powders, juices, and ointments from crushed raw medicinal materials; this means the active substances will be more potent and work faster - in small particles, the extraction of active substances is more complete and faster. Usually leaves, flowers, and grass are crushed into pieces not exceeding 5 mm; stems, bark, roots - up to 3 mm and seeds - up to 0.5 mm. Remember! 1 teaspoon contains 5 g of raw material, 1 dessert spoon 10 g, 1 tablespoon 15 g, 1 tablespoon with a top 20 g. There are several important rules you must follow: • Do not combine a lot of herbs in one bowl at once. • Do not prepare a large amount of decoction at once. Calculate how much you need during the day. Brew a new one the next day. • When brewing grass, do not boil it for a long time. • Do not drink cold infusions, they are much more potent and served warm.

For a long time, the ability to collect, harvest, infuse, and brew various herbs, prepare infusions has been considered a real talent. Indeed, this is a science based on knowledge of the human body, nature, plants, seasons, and the ability to prepare medicinal decoctions and tinctures. Knowledge about herbal medicine is often passed down from generation to generation within communities or families. This book seeks to collate this valuable information and summarize it so that anybody who wants to be prepared for a disaster situation can also harness this knowledge.

It would be especially useful if they can prepare the ingredients or remedies in advance so they don’t have to harvest and prepare plants in an emergency situation. Collecting and harvesting medicinal plants is only possible if you have a good knowledge of plants and natural medicine. As previously mentioned, medicinal plants contain substances that have, to a greater or lesser extent, healing properties. When treating illness with medicinal herbs (phytotherapy), both the whole plant and its individual parts (leaves, root, etc.) are used. It should not be forgotten that different parts of the plant may contain active substances that differ in their properties and characteristics. Accordingly, the collection of these parts must be done at different times. When collecting and harvesting medicinal plants, special attention should be paid to the quality of the plant itself and the place of collection. Do not collect plants in cities, near highways and other industrial facilities. You should not harvest wilting or dead medicinal plants; they must be harvested fresh. When deciding on when to harvest the plant, remember to choose a time when the plant will contain the maximum amount of medicinal substance. You can quite effectively replace the items in your modern first aid kit with items derived from plants. Below are the main recommendations: For cleansing wounds and skin lesions (apply externally): INFUSIONS: chamomile, clover, nettle, elm, shandra (except roots), undergrowth (except roots), goose cinquefoil (except roots), chistets (except roots) and yarrow (except roots). DECOCTION: burdock, comfrey, mallow, marshmallow and oak bark. JUICE: mosquito and watercress. For antiseptics (apply both internally and externally): garlic juice, leaves and flowers of mallow, marshmallow broth, horseradish and thyme. At high body temperatures: chamomile, elderberry, elm, lime. For colds and sore throats: INFUSIONS: burdock, blueberry, borage, chamomile, comfrey, shandra, lime, lungwort, mallow, mint, nettle leaves, plantain, sapling, thyme and yarrow.

There are a number of ways to recover from certain diseases, which you need to be aware of. If you get dysentery, take charcoal. Another method of treatment is boiling tree bark for a long time - from 12 hours to three days – The evaporating water must be replaced. The resulting decoction will be dark, almost black in color and smell bad, but drink it anyway - it will help you recover. Tea, like the bark, also contains tannin, which helps in the treatment of dysentery. Larvae can be used to clean wounds. A strange idea at first glance and we do not recommend using it in modern times, this is purely so you can be informed about what to do in emergency situations. Leave a non-bleeding wound open to air until the larvae appear in it (especially in a hot climate zone). At the same time, make sure that the larvae, having eaten the dead tissue, do not start eating the healthy tissue. The above are the golden rules for survival. The second part of the book will offer practical natural medicine preparations for many common and not so common health issues.
