There is no need for you to fear snakes if you know -- • Their habits. • How to identify the dangerous kinds. • Precautions to take to prevent snakebite. • What actions to take in case of snakebite ( Chapter 3 ). For a man wearing shoes and trousers and living in a camp, the danger of being bitten by a poisonous snake is small compared to the hazards of malaria, cholera, dysentery, or other diseases. Nearly all snakes avoid man if possible. Reportedly, however, a few -- the king cobra of Southeast Asia, the bushm aster and tropical rattlesnake of South America, and the mamba of Africa -- sometimes aggressively attack man, but even these snakes do so only occasionally. Most snakes get out of the way and are seldom seen. WAYS TO AVOID SNAKEBITE Snakes are widely distr ibuted. They are found in all tropical, subtropical, and most temperate regions. Some species of snakes have specialized glands that contain a toxic venom and long hollow fangs to inject their venom. Although venomous snakes use their venom to secure food , they also use it for self - defense. Human accidents occur when you don't see or hear the snake, when you step on them, or when you walk too close to them. Follow these simple rules to reduce the chance of accidental snakebite: • Don't sleep next to brush, tall grass, large boulders, or trees. They provide hiding places for snakes. Place your sleeping bag in a clearing. Use mosquito netting tucked well under the bag. This netting should provide a good barrier. • Don't put your hands into dark places, such as rock crevices, heavy brush, or hollow logs, without first investigating. • Don't step over a fallen tree. Step on the log and look to see if there is a snake resting on the other side. • Don't walk through heavy brush or tall grass without looking down. Look where you are walking."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"• Don't pick up any snake unless you are absolutely positive it is not venomous. • Don't pick up freshly killed snakes without first severing the head. The nervous system may still be active and a dead snake can deliver a bite. SNAKE GROUPS Snakes dangerous to man usually fall into two groups: proteroglypha and solenoglypha. Their fangs and their venom best describe these two groups ( Figure E - 1 ). Fangs The proteroglypha have, in front of the upper jaw and preceding t he ordinary teeth, permanently erect fangs. These fangs are called fixed fangs. The solenoglypha have erectile fangs; that is, fangs they can raise to an erect position. These fangs are called folded fangs. Venom The fixed - fang snakes (proteroglypha) us ually have neurotoxic venoms. These venoms affect the nervous system, making the victim unable to breathe. The folded - fang snakes (solenoglypha) usually have hemotoxic venoms. These venoms affect the circulatory system, destroying blood cells, damaging sk in tissues, and causing internal hemorrhaging. Remember, however, that most poisonous snakes have both neurotoxic and hemotoxic venom. Usually one type of venom in the snake is dominant and the other is weak. Poisonous Versus Nonpoisonous Snakes No sing le characteristic distinguishes a poisonous snake from a harmless one except the presence of poison fangs and glands. Only in dead specimens can you determine the presence of these fangs and glands without danger. DESCRIPTIONS OF POISONOUS SNAKES"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"There ar e many different poisonous snakes throughout the world. It is unlikely you will see many except in a zoo. This manual describes only a few poisonous snakes. You should, however, be able to spot a poisonous snake if you -- • Learn about the two groups of snak es and the families in which they fall ( Figure E - 2 ). • Examine the pictures and read the descriptions of snakes in this appendix. Viperidae The viperidae or true vipers usually have thick bodies and heads that are much wider than their necks ( Figure E - 3 ). However, there are many different sizes, markings, and colorations."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":" This snake group has developed a highly sophisticated means for delivering venom. They have long, hollow fangs that perform like hypodermic needles. They deliver their venom deep into the wound. The fangs of this group of snakes are movable. These snakes fold their fangs into the roof of their mouths. When they strike, their fangs come forward, stabbing the victim. The snake controls the movement of its fangs; fang movement is not automatic. The venom is usually hemotoxic. There are, however, several speci es that have large quantities of neurotoxic elements, thus making them even more dangerous. The vipers are responsible for many human fatalities around the world. Crotalidae The crotalids, or pit vipers ( Figure E - 4 ), may be either slender or thick - bodied. Their heads are usually much wider than their necks. These snakes take their name from the deep pit located between the eye and the nostril. They are commonly brown with dark blotches, though some kinds are green."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" Rattlesnakes, copperheads, cottonmouths, and several species of dangerous snakes from Central and South America, Asia, China, and India fall into the pit viper group. The pit is a highly sensitive organ capable of picking up the slightest temperature variance. Most pit vipers are nocturnal. They hunt for food at night with the aid of these speciali zed pits that let them locate prey in total darkness. Rattlesnakes are the only pit vipers that possess a rattle at the tip of the tail. India has about 12 species of these snakes. You find them in trees or on the ground in all types of terrain. The tree snakes are slender; the ground snakes are heavy - bodied. All are dangerous. China has a pit viper similar to the cottonmouth found in North America. You find it in the rocky areas of the remote mountains of South China. It reaches a length of 1.4 meters bu t is not vicious unless irritated. You can also find a small pit viper, about 45 centimeters long, on the plains of eastern China. It is too small to be dangerous to a man wearing shoes. There are about 27 species of rattlesnakes in the United States and Mexico. They vary in color and may or may not have spots or blotches. Some are small while others, such as the diamondbacks, may grow to 2.5 meters long. There are five kinds of rattlesnakes in Central and South America, but only the tropical rattlesnake is widely distributed. The rattle on the tip of the tail is sufficient identification for a rattlesnake. Most will try to escape without a fight when approached, but there is always a chance one will strike at a passerby. They do not always give a warning ; they may strike first and rattle afterwards or not at all."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"The genus Trimeresurus is a subgroup of the crotalidae. These are Asian pit vipers. These pit vipers are normally tree - loving snakes with a few species living on the ground. They basically have the same characteristics of the crotalidae -- slender build and very dangerous. Their bites usually are on the upper extremities -- head, neck, and shoulders. Their venom is largely hemotoxic. Elapidae A group of highly dangerous snakes with powerful neuroto xic venom that affects the nervous system, causing respiratory paralysis. Included in this family are coral snakes, cobras, mambas, and all the Australian venomous snakes. The coral snake is small and has caused human fatalities. The Australian death adder , tiger, taipan, and king brown snakes are among the most venomous in the world, causing many human fatalities. Only by examining a dead snake can you positively determine if it is a cobra or a near relative ( Figure E - 5 ). On cobras, kraits, and coral snakes, the third scale on the upper lip touches both the nostril scale and the eye. The krait also has a row of enlarged scales down its ridged back. You can find the cobras of Africa and the Near East in almost any habitat. One kind may live in or near water, another in trees. Some are aggressive and savage. The distance a cobra can strike in a forward direction is equal to the distance its head is raised above the ground. Some cobras, however, can spit venom a distance of 3 to 3.5 meters. This venom is harmless unless it gets into your eyes; then it may cause bl indness if not washed out immediately. Poking around in holes and rock piles is dangerous because of the chance of encountering a spitting cobra. Laticaudinae and Hydrophidae"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"A subfamily of elapidae, these snakes are specialized in that they found a bett er environment in the oceans. Why they are in the oceans is not clear to science. Sea snakes differ in appearance from other snakes in that they have an oarlike tail to aid in swimming. Some species of sea snakes have venom several times more toxic than t he cobra's. Because of their marine environment, sea snakes seldom come in contact with humans. The exceptions are fisherman who capture these dangerous snakes in fish nets and scuba divers who swim in waters where sea snakes are found. There are many spe cies of sea snakes. They vary greatly in color and shape. Their scales distinguish them from eels that have no scales. Sea snakes occur in salt water along the coasts throughout the Pacific. There are also sea snakes on the east coast of Africa and in the Persian Gulf. There are no sea snakes in the Atlantic Ocean. There is no need to fear sea snakes. They have not been known to attack a man swimming. Fishermen occasionally get bit by a sea snake caught in a net. The bite is dangerous. Colubridae The la rgest group of snakes worldwide. In this family there are species that are rear - fanged; however, most are completely harmless to man. They have a venom - producing gland and enlarged, grooved rear fangs that allow venom to flow into the wound. The inefficien t venom apparatus and the specialized venom is effective on cold - blooded animals (such as frogs and lizards) but not considered a threat to human life.

Know which ones are dangerous, what the dangers of the various fish are, what precautions to take, and what to do if you are injured by one of these fish. Fish and mollusks will present a danger in one of three ways: by attacking and biting you, by injecting toxic venom into you through its venomous spines or tentacles, and through eating fish or mollusks whose flesh is toxic. The danger of actually encount ering one of these dangerous fish is relatively small, but it is still significant. Any one of these fish can kill you. Avoid them if at all possible. FISH THAT ATTACK MAN The shark is usually the first fish that comes to mind when considering fish that a ttack man. Other fish also fall in this category, such as the barracuda, the moray eel, and the piranha. Sharks Sharks are potentially the most dangerous fish that attack people. The obvious danger of sharks is that they are capable of seriously maiming or killing you with their bite. Of the many shark species, only a relative few are dangerous. Of these, four species are responsible for most cases of shark attacks on humans. These are the white, tiger, hammerhead, and blue sharks. There are also records of attacks by ground, gray nurse, and mako sharks. See Figure F - 1 for illustrations of sharks."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":" Avoid sharks if at all possible. Follow the procedures discussed in Chapter 16 to defend yourself against a shark attack. Sharks vary in size, but there is no relationship between the size of the shark and likelihood of attack. Even the smaller sharks can be dangerous, especially when they are traveling in schools. If bitten by a shark, the most important measure for you to take is to stop the bleeding quickly. Blood in the water attracts sharks. Get yourself or the victim into a raft or to"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"shore as soon as possible. If in the water, form a circle around the victim (if not alone), and stop the bleeding with a tourniquet. Other Ferocious Fish I n salt water, other ferocious fish include the barracuda, sea bass, and moray eel ( Figure F - 2 ). The sea bass is usually an open water fish. It is dangerous due to its large size. It can remove large pieces of flesh from a human. Barracudas and moray eels have been known to attack man and inflict vicious bites. Be careful of these two species when near reefs and in shallow water. Moray eels are very aggressive when disturbed. In fresh water, piranha are the only significantly dangerous fish. They are inhabitants of the tropics and are restricted to northern Sou th America. These fish are fairly small, about 5 to 7.5 centimeters, but they have very large teeth and travel in large schools.

Portuguese man - of - war Physalis species Although it resembles a jellyfish, the Portuguese man - of - war is actually a colony of sea animals. Mainly found in tropical regions, the Gulf stream current can carry it as far as Europe. It is also found as far south as Australia.

These tentacles inflict a painful and incapacitating sting, but the sting is rarely fatal."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":" C o n e s h e l l s Conidae species These cone - shaped shells have smooth, colorful mottling and long, narrow openings in the base of the shell. They live under rocks, in crevices and coral reefs, and along rocky shores and protected bays in tropical areas. All have tiny teeth that are similar to hypodermic needles. They can inject an extremely poisonous venom that acts very swiftly, causing acute pain, swelling, paralysis, blindness, and possible death within hou rs. Avoid handling all cone shells. Terebra shells Terebridae species These shells are found in both temperate and tropical waters. They are similar to cone shells but much thinner and longer. They poison in the same way as cone shells, but their venom is not as poisonous. FISH WITH TOXIC FLESH"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"There are no simple rules to tell edible fish from those with poisonous flesh. The most common toxic fish are shown in Figure 8 - 2 . All of these fish contain various types of poisonous substances or toxins in their flesh and are dangerous to eat. They have the followin g common characteristics: • Most live in shallow water around reefs or lagoons. • Many have boxy or round bodies with hard shell - like skins covered with bony plates or spines. They have small parrotlike mouths, small gills, and small or absent belly fins. Th eir names suggest their shape. In addition to the above fish and their characteristics, barracuda and red snapper fish may carry ciguatera, a toxin that accumulates in the s ystems of fish that feed on tropical marine reefs. Without specific local information, take the following precautions: • Be very careful with fish taken from normally shallow lagoons with sandy or broken coral bottoms. Reef - feeding species predominate and some may be poisonous. • Avoid poisonous fish on the leeward side of an island. This area of shallow water consists of patches of living corals mixed with open spaces and may extend seaward for some distance. Many different types of fish inhabit these shall ow waters, some of which are poisonous. • Do not eat fish caught in any area where the water is unnaturally discolored. This may be indicative of plankton that cause various types of toxicity in plankton - feeding fish. • Try fishing on the windward side or in deep passages leading from the open sea to the lagoon, but be careful of currents and waves. Live coral reefs drop off sharply into deep water and form a dividing line between the suspected fish of the shallows and the desirable deep - water species . Deepwa ter fish are usually not poisonous. You can catch the various toxic fish even in deep water. Discard all suspected reef fish, whether caught on the ocean or the reef side."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":" APPENDIX G CLOUDS: FORETELLERS OF WEATHER About 200 years ago an Englishman classified clouds ac cording to what they looked like to a person seeing them from the ground. He grouped them into three classes and gave them Latin names: cirrus, cumulus, and stratus. These three names, alone and combin ed with other Latin words, are still used to identify different cloud formations. By being familiar with the different cloud formation and what weather they portend, you can take appropriate action for your protection. Cirrus clouds Cirrus clouds are the very high clouds that look like thin streaks or curls. They are usually 6 kilometers or more above the earth and are usually a sign of f air weather. In cold climates, however, cirrus clouds that begin to multiply and are accompanied by increasing winds blowing steadily from a northerly direction indicate an oncoming blizzard."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":" Cumulus clouds Cumulus clouds are fluffy, white, heaped - up clouds. These clouds, which are much lower than cirrus clouds, are often fair weather clouds. They are apt to appear around midday on a sunny day, looking like large cotton balls with flat bottoms. As the day advances, they may become bigger and push higher into the atmosphere. Piling up to appear like a mountain of clouds. These can turn into storm clouds. Stratus clouds Stratus clouds are very low, gray clouds, often making an even gray layer over the whole sky. These clouds generally mean rain."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":" Nimbus clouds Nimbus clouds are ram clouds of uniform grayness that extend over the entire sky Cumulonimbus clouds Cumulonimbus is the cloud formation resulting from a cumulus cloud building up, extending to great heights, and forming in the shape of an anvil.

Cirrostratus clouds indicate good weather. Cirrocumulus clouds Cirrocumulus is a small, whi te, round cloud at a high altitude. Cirrocumulus clouds indicate good weather."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":" Scuds A loose, vapory cloud (scud) driven before the wind is a sign of continuing bad weather."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":" APPENDIX H CONTINGENCY PLAN OF ACTION FORMAT Properly planning for the possible contingencies that may occur during a mission is a positive step toward being able to cope successfully with the changes in situation. The contingency plan of action is a critical document to an individual soldier, or to a unit, faced with evading enemy forces. First, it is a plan that will provide evaders a starting point to begin operating effectively once evasion has begun. Second, it gives recovery forces the ability to know what the evaders are planning to do, thus making recovery, operations easier. A well - thought - out contingency plan of action that everyone can understand is an important document to th e evader.
