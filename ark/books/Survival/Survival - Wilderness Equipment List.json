[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Recommended Equipment List Physical Fitness: The better shape that you are in, the better your chances of escaping or surviving dangerous situations. Everyone should strive for a maximum level of fitness. Being able to run 5 Kilometers (3.1 miles) in 30 minutes or less with running gear is a good start, and is a measure of some cardiovascular fitness and the ability to get somewhere if you have to. It is important for the individual in the field to be of sufficient mobility with a battle load to be able to either get somewhere quickly enough to be effective, or to escape from an area in order to live to fight another day. In a three-dimensional urban environment, climbing steps, ladders, and ropes, and being able to effectively move through streets, alleys, and buildings will severely test one's fitness. Field Uniform: Shirts and trousers of woodland or similar camouflage: Your environment will dictate the exact nature of your camouflage. Outdoor hiking socks: Good, thick socks will protect your feet from blisters during protracted movement. Brown or green will be preferred. Underwear: Comfortable, loose-fitting underwear, brown or green, will be best. Extra socks and underwear. Good pair of lightweight hiking or hunting boots. Prior to an emergency, make sure that your boots fit well, and that they are comfortable enough for many miles of walking. Headgear: To protect from wind, sun, and rain. Boonie hats work the best. Lightweight gloves to protect your hands from cuts. Heavy winter gear as needed. Military surplus is usually the best. Personal Weapon: Any semi-automatic rifle in .223 caliber (like the AR15 or Mini-14), 7.62X39 caliber (like the Mini-30, SKS, or MAK90) or .308 caliber (like the M14). A good, pump-action 12-gauge shotgun (like the Mossberg 500). Personal handgun. Please train with your weapons prior to any situation in which you may need them.
