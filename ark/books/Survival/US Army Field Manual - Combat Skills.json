Wars are not won by machines and weapons but by the soldiers who use them. Even the best equipped army cannot win without motivated and well-trained soldiers. If the US Army is to win the next war, its soldiers must be motivated by inspired leadership, and they must know how to do their jobs and survive on the battlefield. This is the soldier’s field manual. It tells the soldier how to perform the combat skills needed to survive on the battlefield. These are basic skills that must be learned by soldiers in all military occupational specialties (MOS).

So you must be concealed from enemy observation and have cover from enemy fire. When the terrain does not provide natural cover and concealment, you must prepare your cover and use natural and man-made materials to camouflage yourself, your equipment, and your position. This chapter provides guidance on the preparation and use of cover, concealment, and camouflage.

Cover can also conceal you from enemy observa- tion. Cover can be natural or man-made. Natural cover includes such things as logs, trees, stumps, ravines, and hollows. Man- made cover includes such things as fighting positions, trenches, walls, rubble, and craters. Even the smallest depression or fold in the ground can give some cover. Look for and use every bit of cover the terrain offers. In combat, you need protection from enemy direct and indirect fire. To get this protection in the defense, build a fighting position (man-made cover) to add to the natural cover afforded by the terrain. 1-2 To get protection from enemy fire in the offense or when moving, use routes that put cover between you and the places where the enemy is known or thought to be. Use ravines, gullies, hills, wooded areas, walls, and other cover to keep the enemy from seeing and firing at you. Avoid open areas, and do not skyline yourself on hilltops and ridges."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 CONCEALMENT Concealment is anything that hides you from enemy observation. Concealment does not protect you from enemy fire. Do not think that you are protected from the enemy’s fire just because you are concealed. Concealment, like cover, can also be natural or man-made. Natural concealment includes such things as bushes, grass, trees, and shadows. If possible, natural concealment should not be disturbed. Man-made concealment includes such things as battle-dress uniforms, camouflage nets, face paint, and natural material that has been moved from its original location. Man-made conceal- ment must blend into the natural concealment provided by the terrain. Light discipline, noise discipline, move- ment discipline, and the use of camouflage contribute to concealment. Light discipline is controlling the use of lights at night by such things as not smoking in the open, not walking around with a flashlight on, and not using vehicle headlights. Noise discipline is taking action to deflect sounds generated by your unit (such as operating equipment) away from the enemy and, when possible, using methods to communicate that do not generate sounds (arm-and-hand signals). Movement discipline is such things as not moving about fighting positions unless necessary, and not moving on routes that lack cover and concealment. In the defense, build a well-camouflaged fighting posi- tion and avoid moving about. In the offense, conceal yourself and your equipment with camouflage and move in woods or on terrain that gives concealment. Darkness cannot hide you from enemy observation in either offense or defense. The enemy’s night vision devices and other detection means let them find you in both daylight and darkness. CAMOUFLAGE Camouflage is anything you use to keep yourself, your equipment, and your position from looking like what they are. Both natural and man-made material can be used for camouflage. Change and improve your camouflage often. The time between changes and improve- ments depends on the weather and on the material used. Natural camouflage will often die, fade, or otherwise lose its effectiveness. Likewise, man-made camouflage may wear off or fade. When those things happen, you and your equipment or position may not blend with the surroundings. That may make it easy for the enemy to spot you. CAMOUFLAGE CONSIDERATIONS Movement draws attention. When you give arm-and-hand signals or walk about your position, your movement can be seen by the naked eye at long ranges. In the defense, stay low and move only when necessary. In the offense, move only on covered and concealed routes. Positions must not be where the enemy expects to find them. Build positions on the side of a hill, away from road junctions or lone buildings, and in covered and concealed places. Avoid open areas. 1-3"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 Outlines and shadows may reveal your position or equipment to air or ground ob- servers. Outlines and shadows can be broken up with camouflage. When moving, stay in the shadows when possible. Shine may also attract the enemy’s at- tention. In the dark, it may be a light such as a burning cigarette or flashlight. In daylight, it 1-4 can be reflected light from polished surfaces such as shiny mess gear, a worn helmet, a wind- shield, a watch crystal and band, or exposed skin. A light, or its reflection, from a position may help the enemy detect the position. To reduce shine, cover your skin with clothing and face paint. However, in a nuclear attack, darkly painted skin can absorb more thermal energy and may burn more readily than bare skin. Also, dull the surfaces of equipment and vehicles with paint, mud, or some type of camouflage material."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 Shape is outline or form. The shape of a helmet is easily recognized. A human body is also easily recognized. Use camouflage and concealment to breakup shapes and blend them with their surroundings. Be careful not to overdo it. The colors of your skin, uniform, and equipment may help the enemy detect you if the colors contrast with the background. For example, a green uniform will contrast with snow-covered terrain. Camouflage yourself and your equipment to blend with the surroundings. 1-5"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 Dispersion is the spreading of men, vehi- cles, and equipment over a wide area. It is usually easier for the enemy to detect soldiers when they are bunched. So, spread out. The distance between you and your fellow soldier will vary with the terrain, degree of visibility, and enemy situation. Distances will normally be set by unit leaders or by a unit’s standing operating procedure (SOP). 1-6"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 HOW TO CAMOUFLAGE Before camouflaging, study the terrain and vegetation of the area in which you are operating. Then pick and use the camouflage material that best blends with that area. When moving from one area to another, change camou- flage as needed to blend with the surroundings. Take grass, leaves, brush, and other material from your location and apply it to your uniform and equipment and put face paint on your skin. 1-7"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 Fighting Positions. When building a fighting position, camouflage it and the dirt taken from it. Camouflage the dirt used as frontal, flank, rear, and overhead cover. Also camouflage the bottom of the hole to prevent detection from the air. If necessary, take excess dirt away from the position (to the rear). Do not overcamouflage. Too much camou- flage material may actually disclose a position. Get your camouflage material from a wide area. An area stripped of all or most of its vegetation may draw attention. Do not wait until the posi- tion is complete to camouflage it. Camouflage the position as you build. - Do not leave shiny or light-colored objects lying about. Hide mess kits, mirrors, food con- tainers, and white underwear and towels. Do not remove your shirt in the open. Your skin may shine and be seen. Never use fires where there is a chance that the flame will be seen or the smoke will be smelled by the enemy. Also, cover up tracks and other signs of movement. 1-8"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 When camouflage is complete, inspect the position from the enemy’s side. This should be done from about 35 meters forward of the position. Then check the camouflage periodi- cally to see that it stays natural-looking and conceals the position. When the camouflage becomes ineffective, change and improve it. Helmets. Camouflage your helmet with the issue helmet cover or make a cover of cloth or burlap that is colored to blend with the terrain. The cover should fit loosely with the flaps folded under the helmet or left hanging. The hanging flaps may break up the helmet outline. Leaves, grass, or sticks can also be attached to the cover. Use camouflage bands, strings, burlap strips, or rubber bands to hold those in place. If there is no material for a helmet cover, dis- guise and dull helmet surface with irregular patterns of paint or mud. Uniforms. Most uniforms come already camou- flaged. However, it may be necessary to add more camouflage to make the uniform blend better with the surroundings. To do this, put mud on the uniform or attach leaves, grass, or small branches to it. Too much camouflage, however, may draw attention. 1-9"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 When operating on snow-covered ground, Skin.

Cover and concealment are best provided by some type of fight- ing position. This may be an existing hole, a hastily dug prone shelter, or a well-prepared position with overhead cover. The time available for preparation determines how well you build your position. Your fighting position must: Allow you to fire. Protect you from observation and direct and indirect fire.

The position should have frontal cover to give protection from small arms fire from the front. Natural frontal cover (trees, rocks, logs, and rubble) is best, because it is hard for the enemy to detect a position that is concealed by natural cover. If natural cover is not available, use the dirt taken from the hole you dig to build additional cover. The cover can be improved by putting the dirt in sandbags and then wetting them. Frontal cover must be: 2-2 Thick enough (at least 46 cm [18 in] of dirt) to stop small arms fire. High enough to protect your head when you fire from behind the cover. Far enough in front of the hole to allow room for elbow holes and sector stakes so that you can fire to the oblique. Long enough to give you cover and hide the muzzle blast of your rifle when you fire to the oblique."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 Your fighting position should be built so that, when you come under direct fire from your front, you can move behind the frontal cover for protection and yet fire to the oblique. 2-3"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 For all-round protection, to include pro- tection from a nuclear attack, your position should also have overhead, flank, and rear cover. The dirt from the hole can also be used to build that cover, which protects against indirect fire that bursts overhead or to the flanks and rear of the position. Cover also guards against the effects of friendly weapons supporting from the rear, such as small arms fire or discarding sabot rounds fired from tanks. You should leave crawl spaces in the rear cover. This lets you enter and leave the position without exposing yourself to the enemy. To increase your chances of survival in a nuclear attack, you should insure that your fighting position incorporates the following considerations: Rounded walls hold up better against a blast wave than square or rectangu- lar walls, and rounded walls are easier to dig. Small openings help keep out radia- tion. Most nuclear radiation in the bottom of the position is scattered into the position through the opening. Deeper fighting positions place a greater thickness of shielding material or earth between you and the nuclear detonation therefore, deep positions provide greater reduction of initial radiation entering the hole. Radiation is reduced by a factor of two for each 16 inches of hole depth. Low body positions put more dirt be- tween you and the source of radiation. Curling upon your side or, better yet, lying on your back with knees drawn up to the chest is best. Tucked-up legs and arms tend to shield the body from radiation. Thermal radiation enters your fighting position by line of sight or by reflec- tion off the sides. Dark and rough materials (such as wool blankets and shelter halves) can be used to cover potential reflecting surfaces. 2-4"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 CONCEALMENT If your position can be detected, it can be hit by enemy fire. If it can be hit, you can be killed in it. Therefore, your position must be so well hidden that the enemy will have a hard time detecting it even after he is in hand-grenade range. Natural, undisturbed concealment is better than man-made concealment because: It is already prepared. It usually will not attract the enemy’s attention. It need not be replaced. While digging your position, try not to disturb the natural concealment around it. Put the unused dirt from the hole behind the posi- tion and camouflage it. Camouflage material that does not have to be replaced (rocks, logs, live bushes, and grass) is best. You should not use so much camouflage that your position looks different from its surroundings. Your position must be concealed from enemy aircraft as well as from ground troops. If the position is under a bush or tree, or in a building, it is less likely to be seen from above. Leaves, straw, or grass placed on the floor of the hole will keep the fresh earth from con- trasting with the ground around it. Do not use sticks, as they may stop grenades from rolling — into the grenade sumps. Man-made concealment must blend with its surroundings so that it cannot be detected. SECTORS AND FIELDS OF FIRE The sectors of fire are those areas into which you must observe and fire. When your leader assigns you a fighting position, he should also assign you a primary and a secondary sector of fire. The primary sector of fire is to the oblique of your position, and the secondary sector of fire is to the front. 2-5"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 To be able to see and fire into your sectors Cut off lower branches of large, scat- of fire, you may have to clear some vegetation and other obstructions from them.

It should be behind whatever cover is available. It should give frontal cover from enemy direct fire but allow firing to the front and the oblique. The term hasty does not mean that there is no digging. If there is a natural hole or ditch available, use it. If not, dig a prone shelter that will give some protection. The hole should be about one-half meter (18 to 20 in) deep. Use the dirt from the hole to build cover around the edge of the position. 2-8 TWO-MAN FIGHTING POSITION In the defense, you and another soldier will build a two-man fighting position.

The smaller the hole, the less likely it is that rounds, grenades, or airburst fragments will get into it. It should be large enough for you and your buddy in full combat gear. It should extend beyond the edges of the frontal cover enough to let you and your buddy observe and fire to the front. The hole is usually dug straight, but it may be curved around the frontal cover. Curving the hole around the frontal cover may be necessary in close terrain to allow better observation and fire to the front and to the next flank position. To curve the hole, simply extend one or both ends of it around the frontal cover. A curved hole lets one of you watch for the enemy to the front while the other sleeps or eats. Also, you can observe and fire to the front when not being fired at, and move back behind the frontal cover when under heavy fire. 2-9"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 On a steep slope, a straight hole may at attackers.

Use the following techniques to avoid being seen or heard by the enemy: Camouflage yourself and your equip- ment. Tape your dog tags together and to the chain so they cannot slide or rattle. Tape or pad the parts of your weapon and equipment that rattle or are so loose that they may snag (the tape or padding must not interfere with the operation of the weapon or equip- ment). Jump up and down and listen for rattles. Wear soft, well-fitting clothes. Do not carry unnecessary equipment. Move from covered position to revered position (taking no longer than 3 to 5 seconds between positions). Stop, look, and listen before moving. Look for your next position before leaving a position. Look for covered and concealed routes on which to move. Change direction slightly from time to time when moving through tall grass. Stop, look, and listen when birds or animals are alarmed (the enemy may be nearby). Use battlefield noises, such as weapon noises, to conceal movement noises. Cross roads and trails at places that have the most cover and concealment (large culverts, low spots, curves, or bridges). Avoid steep slopes and places with loose dirt or stones. Avoid cleared, open areas and tops of hills and ridges. METHODS OF MOVEMENT In addition to walking, you may move in one of three other methods — low crawl, high crawl, or rush. The low crawl gives you the lowest silhou- ette. Use it to cross places where the conceal- 3-2"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 ment is very low and enemy fire or observation prevents you from getting up. Keep your body flat against the ground. With your firing hand, grasp your weapon sling at the upper sling — swivel. Let the front handguard rest on your forearm (keeping the muzzle off the ground), and let the weapon butt drag on the ground. To move, push your arms forward and pull your firing side leg forward. Then pull with your arms and push with your leg. Continue this throughout the move. The high crawl lets you move faster than the low crawl and still gives you a low silhouette. Use this crawl when there is good concealment but enemy fire prevents you from getting up. Keep your body off the ground and resting on your forearms and lower legs. Cradle your weapon in your arms and keep its muzzle off the ground. Keep your knees well behind your buttocks so your body will stay low. To move, alternately advance your right elbow and left knee, then your left elbow and right knee. The rush is the fastest way to move from one position to another. Each rush should last from 3 to 5 seconds. The rushes are kept short to keep enemy machine gunners or riflemen from tracking you. However, do not stop and hit the ground in the open just because 5 seconds have passed. Always try to hit the ground behind some cover. Before moving, pick out your next covered and concealed position and the best route to it. Make your move from the prone position as follows: Slowly raise your head and pick your next position and the route to it. Slowly lower your head. Draw your arms into your body (keep- ing your elbows in). Pull your right leg forward. Raise your body by straightening your arms. Get up quickly. Run to the next position. 3-3"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"When you are ready to stop moving, do the following: Plant both of your feet. Drop to your knees (at the same time slide a hand to the butt of your rifle). Fall forward, breaking the fall with the butt of the rifle. Go to a prone firing position. If you have been firing from one position for some time, the enemy may have spotted you and may be waiting for you to come up from behind cover. So, before rushing forward, roll or crawl a short distance from your position. By coming up from another spot, you may fool an enemy who is aiming at one spot, waiting for you to rise. When the route to your next position is through an open area, rush by zigzagging. If necessary, hit the ground, roll right or left, then rush again. MOVING WITH STEALTH Moving with stealth means moving quietly, slowly, and carefully. This requires great patience. To move with stealth, use the following techniques: Hold your rifle at port arms (ready position). Make your footing sure and solid by keeping your body’s weight on the foot on the ground while stepping. Raise the moving leg high to clear brush or grass. Gently let the moving foot down toe first, with your body’s weight on the rear leg. Lower the heel of the moving foot after the toe is in a solid place. Shift your body’s weight and balance to the forward foot before moving the rear foot. Take short steps to help maintain balance. At night, and when moving through dense vegetation, avoid making noise. Hold your weapon with one hand, and keep the other hand forward, feeling for obstructions. When going into a prone position, use the following techniques: Hold your rifle with one hand and crouch slowly. Feel for the ground with your free hand to make sure it is clear of mines, tripwires, and other hazards. Lower your knees, one at a time, until your body’s weight is on both knees and your free hand. Shift your weight to your free hand and opposite knee. Raise your free leg up and back, and lower it gently to that side. Move the other leg into position the same way. Roll quietly into a prone position. Use the following techniques when crawling: Crawl on your hands and knees. Hold your rifle in your firing hand. Use your nonfiring hand to feel for and make clear spots for your hands and knees to move to. 3-4"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Move your hands and knees to those spots, and put them down softly. IMMEDIATE ACTIONS WHILE MOVING This section furnishes guidance for the immediate actions you should take when react- ing to enemy indirect fire and flares. REACTING TO INDIRECT FIRE If you come under indirect fire while moving, quickly look to your leader for orders. He will either tell you to run out of the impact area in a certain direction or will tell you to follow him. If you cannot see your leader, but can see other team members, follow them. If alone, or if you cannot see your leader or the other team members, run out of the area in a direction away from the incoming fire. 3-5"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 It is hard to move quickly on rough ter- rain, but the terrain may provide good cover. In such terrain, it may be best to take cover and wait for flares to burn out. After they burn out, move out of the area quickly. REACTING TO GROUND FLARES The enemy puts out ground flares as warning devices. He sets them off himself or attaches tripwires to them for you to trip on and set them off. He usually puts the flares in places he can watch. If you are caught in the light of a ground flare, move quickly out of the lighted area. The enemy will know where the ground flare is and will be ready to fire into that area. Move well away from the lighted area. While moving out of the area, look for other team members. Try to follow or join them to keep the team together. REACTING TO AERIAL FLARES The enemy uses aerial flares to light up vital areas. They can be set off like ground 3-6"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 flares; fired from hand projectors, grenade launchers, mortars, and artillery; or dropped from aircraft. If you hear the firing of an aerial flare while you are moving, hit the ground (behind cover if possible) while the flare is rising and before it bursts and illuminates. If moving where it is easy to blend with the background (such as in a forest) and you are caught in the light of an aerial flare, freeze in place until the flare burns out. If you are caught in the light of an aerial flare while moving in an open area, immediately crouch low or lie down. If you are crossing an obstacle, such as a barbed-wire fence or a wall, and get caught in the light of an aerial flare, crouch low and stay down until the flare burns out. The sudden light of a bursting flare may temporarily blind both you and the enemy. When the enemy uses a flare to spot you, he spoils his own night vision. To protect your night vision, close one eye while the flare is burning. When the flare burns out, the eye that was closed will still have its night vision. 3-7"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 MOVING WITHIN A TEAM You will usually move as a member of a wedge, determined by the type weapon he team. Small teams, such as infantry fire teams, carries. That position, however, may be changed normally move in a wedge formation. Each by the team leader to meet the situation. The soldier in the team has a set position in the normal distance between soldiers is 10 meters. 3-8"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 You may have to make a temporary change in the wedge formation when moving through close terrain. The soldiers in the sides of the wedge close into a single file when moving in thick brush or through a narrow pass. After passing through such an area, they should spread out, again forming the wedge. You should not wait for orders to change the for- mation or the interval. You should change automatically and stay in visual contact with the other team members and the team leader. The team leader leads by setting the example. His standing order is, FOLLOW ME AND DO AS I DO. When he moves to the left, you should move to the left. When he gets down, you should get down. When he fires, you should fire. When visibility is limited, control during movement may become difficult. Two l-inch horizontal strips of luminous tape, sewn directly on the rear of the helmet camouflage band with a l-inch space between them, are a device for night identification. Night identification for your patrol cap could be two l-inch by 1 / 2 -inch strips of luminous tape sewn vertically, directly on the rear of the cap. They should be centered, with the bottom edge of each tape even with the bottom edge of the cap and with a l-inch space between two tapes. FIRE AND MOVEMENT When a unit makes contact with the the enemy, it normally starts firing at and moving toward the enemy. Sometimes the unit may move away from the enemy. That technique is called fire and movement. It is conducted either to close with and destroy the enemy, or to move away from the enemy so as to break contact with him. The firing and moving take place at the same time. There is a fire element and a move- ment element. These elements may be single soldiers, buddy teams, fire teams, or squads. Regardless of the size of the elements, the action is still fire and movement. The fire element covers the move of the movement element by firing at the enemy. This helps keep the enemy from firing back at the movement element. The movement element moves either to close with the enemy or to reach a better posi- tion from which to fire at him. The movement element should not move until the fire element is firing. Depending on the distance to the enemy position and on the available cover, the fire element and the movement element switch roles as needed to keep moving. Before the movement element moves beyond the supporting range of the fire element (the distance within which the weapons of the fire element can fire and support the movement 3-9"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 element), it should take a position from which it can fire at the enemy. The movement element then becomes the next fire element and the fire element becomes the next movement element. If your team makes contact, your team leader should tell you to fire or to move. He should also tell you where to fire from, what to fire at, or where to move to. When moving, use the low crawl, high crawl, or rush. MOVING WITH TANKS You will often have to move with tanks. When you must move as fast as the tanks, you should ride on them. However, riding on a tank makes you vulnerable to all types of fire. It also reduces the tank’s maneuverability and the ability to traverse its turret. If contact is made with the enemy, you must dismount from the tank at once. To mount a tank, first get permission from the tank commander. Then mount from the tank’s right front, not its left side where the coax machinegun is mounted. Once mounted, move to the rear deck, stand, and hold on to the bustle rack. If there is not enough room for you on the rear deck, you may have to stand beside the turret and hold onto a hatch or hatch opening. When riding on a tank, be alert for trees that may knock you off and obstacles that may cause the tank to turn suddenly. Also be alert for enemy troops that may cause the tank to travers its turret quickly and fire. Riding on a tank is always hazardous and should be done only when the risks of riding are outweighed by the advantages of riding. 3-10"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 CHAPTER 4 Observation GENERAL During all types of operations, you will be look- ing for the enemy. However, there will be times when you will be posted in an observation post (OP) to watch for enemy activity. An OP is a position from which you watch an assigned sector of observation and report all activity seen or heard in your sector.

DAY OBSERVATION In daylight, use the visual search tech- nique to search terrain. Do this in two steps: Step 1. Make a quick, overall search of the entire sector for obvious tar- gets and unnatural colors, outlines, or movements. Look first at the area just in front of your position, and then quickly scan the entire area out to the maximum range you want to observe. If the sector is wide, divide it and search each subsector as in Step 2. 4-2"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 Step 2. Observe overlapping, 50-meter- wide strips, alternating from left to right and right to left, until you have searched the entire sector. When you see a suspicious spot, search it well. NIGHT OBSERVATION At night, use anyone of three night obser- vation techniques to search terrain. Dark Adaptation Technique. First, let your eyes become adjusted to the darkness. Do so by staying either in a dark area for about 30 minutes, or in a red-lighted area for about 20 minutes followed by about 10 minutes in a dark area. The red-lighted method may save 4-3"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 time by allowing you to get orders, check equip- ment, or do some other job before moving into darkness. Off-Center Vision Technique. Focus your atten- tion on an object but look slightly away from it. The object will be more visible this way than when you look straight at it. Scanning Technique. Again focus your atten- tion on an object, but do not look directly at it. Now move your eyes in short, abrupt, and irregular movements around it, pausing a few seconds after each move. THINGS TO LOOK AND LISTEN FOR In trying to find the enemy in a sector of observation, look and listen for these signs of his presence: Sounds. Dust or vehicle exhaust. Movement. Positions. Outlines or shadows. Shine or glare. Contrasting colors. SOUNDS Listen for such things as footsteps, limbs or sticks breaking, leaves rustling, men cough- ing, and equipment or vehicle sounds. These may be hard to distinguish from other battle- field and animal sounds. Sounds can alert you to the direction or general location of the enemy. They may not pinpoint his exact location. However, if a sound alerts you, you are more apt to spot the enemy. 4-4 DUST OR VEHICLE EXHAUST Moving foot soldiers or vehicles often raise dust. Vehicle exhaust smoke also rises. You can spot dust and vehicle smoke at long ranges. MOVEMENT Look for movement in your the visual search technique. POSITIONS sector. Use Look for enemy positions in obvious places, such as road junctions, hilltops, and lone buildings. Also look at areas with cover and concealment, such as woods and draws. OUTLINES OR SHADOWS Look for outlines or shadows of enemy soldiers, equipment, vehicles, or guns. The enemy may use the shadows of trees or buildings to hide himself and his equipment. Look for him in shaded areas. SHINE OR GLARE In darkness, look for light sources such as burning cigarettes, headlights, or flashlights. In daylight, look for reflected light or glare from smooth, polished surfaces such as wind- shields, headlights, mess gear, watch crystals, or uncamouflaged skin. CONTRASTING COLORS Look for contrasts between background color and the colors of uniforms, equipment, and skin. For example, a soldier’s T-shirt or towel may contrast with its background. RANGE ESTIMATION You must often estimate ranges. Your estimates will be easier to make and more accu- rate if you use the 100-meter unit-of-measure"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 method, the appearance-of-objects method, or the flash-and-sound method. This section discusses the use of these methods. 1OO-METER UNIT-OF-MEASURE METHOD (DAYTIME) Picture a distance of 100 meters on the ground. For ranges up to 500 meters, count the number of 100-meter lengths between the two points you want to measure. Beyond 500 meters, pick a point halfway to the target, count the number of 100-meter lengths to the halfway point, and then double that number to get the range to the target. Sloping ground changes the appearance of l00-meter lengths. Ground that slopes upward makes them look longer than 100 meters, and ground that slopes downward makes them look shorter than 100 meters. Thus, the tendency is to underestimate 100-meter lengths on upslopes and overestimate them on downslopes. The accuracy of the 100-meter method depends on how much ground is visible. This is most true at long ranges. If a target is at a range of 500 meters or more, and you can only see part of the ground between yourself and the target, it is hard to use this method with accuracy. APPEARANCE-OF-OBJECTS METHOD (DAYTIME) This method is a way to estimate range by the apparent size and detail of an object. It is a common method that is used in everyday life. For example, a motorist trying to pass another car judges the distance of oncoming cars based on their apparent size. He is not interested in exact distances, but only in having enough room to safely pass the car in front of him. Suppose he knows that at a distance of 1 mile an oncoming car appears to be 1 inch wide and 2 inches high, with a half inch between the headlights. Then, any time he sees an oncoming car that fits those dimensions, he knows it is about 1 mile away. The same technique can be used to esti- mate ranges on the battlefield. If you know the apparent size and detail of troops and equip- ment at known ranges, then you can compare those characteristics to similar objects at unknown ranges. When the characteristics match, the range does also. To use the appearance-of-objects method, you must be familiar with characteristic details of objects as they appear at various ranges. As you must be able to see those details to make the method work, anything that limits visibility (such as weather, smoke, or darkness) will limit the effectiveness of this method. COMBINATION OF METHODS Battlefield conditions are not always ideal for estimating ranges. If the terrain limits the use of the 100-meter unit-of-measure method, and poor visibility limits the use of the appearance-of-objects method, you may have to use a combination of methods. For example, if you cannot see all of the terrain out to the target, you can still estimate distance from the apparent size and detail of the target itself. A haze may obscure the target details, but you may still be able to judge its size or use the 100-meter method. By using either one or both of the methods, you should arrive at a figure close to the true range. FLASH-AND-SOUND METHOD (BEST AT NIGHT) Sound travels through air at 300 meters (1,100 feet) per second. That makes it possible to estimate distance if you can both see and hear a sound-producing action. When you see the flash or smoke of a weapon, or the dust it raises, immediately start counting.

This chapter prescribes active and passive pro- tection measures that will avoid or reduce the effects of NBC weapons.

CHARACTERISTICS OF NUCLEAR EXPLOSIONS The four main characteristics of nuclear explosions are: BLAST (an intense shock wave). THERMAL RADIATION (heat and light). NUCLEAR RADIATION (radioactive material). EMP (electrical power surge). 5-2"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 Blast produces an intense shockwave and high winds that create flying debris. It may collapse shelters and some fighting positions. Thermal radiation causes burns and starts fires. The bright flash at the time of the ex- plosion can cause a temporary loss of vision or permanent eye damage if you look at the explosion, especially at night. Nuclear radiation can cause casualties and delay movements. It may last for days and cover large areas of terrain. It occurs in two stages: initial and residual. Initial radiation is emitted directly from the fireball in the first minute after the explosion. It travels at the speed of light along straight lines and has high penetrating power. Residual radiation lingers after the first minute. It comes from the radio- active material originally in a nuclear weapon or from material, such as soil and equipment, made radioactive by the nuclear explosion. EMP is a massive surge of electrical power. It is created the instant a nuclear detonation occurs and is transmitted at the speed of light in all directions. It can damage solid-state components of electrical equipment (radios, radars, computers, vehicles) and weapon systems (TOW and Dragon). Equip- ment can be protected by disconnecting it from its power source and placing it in or behind some type of shielding material (armored vehi- cle or dirt wall) out of the line of sight to the burst. If no warning is received prior to a detonation, there is no effective means of protecting operating equipment. EFFECTS ON SOLDIERS The exposure of the human body to nuclear radiation causes damage to the cells in all. parts of the body. This damage is the cause of “radiation sickness.” The severity of this sick- ness depends on the radiation dose received, the length of exposure, and the condition of the body at the time. The early symptoms of radia- tion sickness will usually appear 1 to 6 hours after exposure. Those symptoms may include headache, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Early symptoms may then be followed by a latent period in which the symptoms disappear. There is no first aid for you once you have been exposed to nuclear radiation. The only help is to get as comfortable as possible while under- going the early symptoms. If the radiation dose was small, the symp- toms, if any, will probably go away and not recur. If the symptoms recur after a latent period, you should go to an aid station. EFFECTS ON EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES Blast can crush sealed or partly sealed objects like food cans, barrels, fuel tanks, and helicopters. Rubble from buildings being knocked down can bury supplies and equipment. Heat can ignite dry wood, fuel, tar- paulins, and other flammable material. Light can damage eyesight. Nuclear radiation can contaminate food and water. PROTECTION AGAINST NUCLEAR ATTACKS The best hasty protection against a nuclear attack is to take cover behind a hill or in a fight- ing position, culvert, or ditch. If caught in the open, drop flat on the ground at once and close your eyes. Cover exposed skin and keep your weapon under your body to avoid loss. If you know the direction of the burst, drop with your head away from the burst. Stay down until the blast wave passes, then check for injuries and equipment damage and prepare to continue the mission. See chapter 2 for additional considera- tions in the building of your fighting positions. 5-3"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 Radiation is the only direct nuclear effect that lingers after the explosion. As it cannot be detected by the senses, use radiac equipment to detect its presence. Procedures for detection can be found in FM 3-12 and FM 21-40. When feasible, move out of the contaminated area. If your unit must stay in the contaminated area, it is best to stay in a dug-in position with overhead cover. When time does not permit con- structing a well-prepared overhead cover, use a 5-4"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 poncho. Stay under cover. When the fallout has finished falling, brush contamination off your- self and your equipment. Wash yourself and your equipment as soon as the mission permits. CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS Enemy forces have both chemical and biological weapons. These weapons may be used separately or together, with or without nuclear weapons. Regardless of how they are used, you must be able to survive their effects and con- tinue your mission. CHARACTERISTICS OF CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL AGENTS AND TOXINS Chemical agents are like poisonous pesti- cides, but are far more powerful. They are meant to kill or injure you and are released to cover large areas. They may be released as gases, liquids, or sprays. The enemy may use a mixture of agents to cause confusion and casualties. Artillery, mortars, rockets, missiles, aircraft, bombs, and land mines can deliver the agents. Biological agents are disease-producing germs. They create a disease hazard where none exists naturally. They may be dispersed as sprays by generators, or delivered by explosives, bomblets, missiles, and aircraft. They may also be spread by the release of germ-carrying flies, mosquitoes, fleas, and ticks. The US Army does not employ these agents, but other armies may. Toxins are poisonous substances produced by living things (such as snake venom). Toxins are not living things and in this sense are chemicals. They would be used in combat in the same way as chemical-warfare agents, and they may disable or kill without warning. EFFECTS ON EQUIPMENT Chemical and biological agents have little direct effect on equipment. Liquid chemical agents on your equipment can restrict its use until it is decontaminated. EFFECTS ON TERRAIN Liquid chemical agents may restrict the use of terrain and buildings. It is difficult to decontaminate terrain. When time permits, it is best to wait for weather to decontaminate terrain naturally. Contami- nated areas should be either bypassed or, when protective equipment is worn, crossed. After crossing a contaminated area, decontaminate yourself and your equipment as soon as the situation permits. EFFECTS ON SOLDIERS Chemical and biological agents may enter your body through your eyes, nose, mouth, or skin. They can disable or kill. Liquid agents may be dispersed on you, your equipment, the terrain, and foliage. The agents may linger for hours or days and en- danger you when you are unprotected. Biological agents are hard to detect in early stages of use. If you find out or suspect that the enemy is using biological agents, report it to your leader. The M8 automatic chemical-agent alarm can detect the presence of chemical agents in the air and produce an audible or visual signal. It will detect nerve, blood, and choking agents. The M43A1 detects only nerve-agent vapor. The use and maintenance of the M8 alarm is the responsibility of the unit NBC defense team. 5-5 161-017 O - 94 - 3"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 DETECTION OF CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL AGENTS tasteless, and invisible in battlefield concentra- tions.

Your main protection against a CB attack is your protective mask. It keeps you from inhaling chemical or bio- logical agents. Additionally, protective clothing will provide protection from liquid agents. Pro- tective clothing includes the mask with hood, the chemical protective suit (overgarment), boots, and gloves. Protection from Insects. The duty uniform and gloves protect you against bites from insects such as mosquitoes and ticks that may carry disease-causing germs. Keep your clothes buttoned and your trouser legs tucked into your boots. Covering the skin reduces the chances of an agent entering the body through cuts and scratches. It also keeps disease-carrying insects from reaching the skin. Insect repellents and insecticides are effective against most disease- carrying insects. High standards of sanitation also protect against some insects. 5-8"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 Mission-Oriented Protective Posture. MOPP is a flexible system of protection against chemical agents. Your leader will specify the level of MOPP based on the chemical threat, workrate, and temperature prior to performing a mission. Later, he may direct a change in MOPP accord- ing to the changing situation. The MOPP level determines what equip- ment you must wear and what you must carry. The standard MOPP levels are shown in the following chart.

The interval between injections is 15 minutes. If you are unable to treat yourself, a buddy must do it for you. He will inject three injectors at once and administer artificial respiration, if necessary. No more than three atropine autoinjectors will be given. Seek medical aid quickly. Blister agents. The symptoms of blister- agent poisoning are burning sensations in the skin, eyes, and nose. The symptoms may be immediate or delayed for several hours or days, depending on the type of agent used. If blister agents come in contact with the eyes or skin, decontaminate the areas at once. Decontami- nate the eyes by flushing them repeatedly with plain water. Remove liquid blister agents from the skin by using the items of the M258A1 kit. If burns or blisters develop on the skin, cover them with sterile gauze or a clean cloth to pre- vent infection. Seek medical aid quickly. Blood agents. The symptoms of blood- agent poisoning are nausea, dizziness, throbbing headache, skin/lips red or pink, convulsions, and coma. If those symptoms appear, hold two crushed ampules of amyl nitrite to the victim’s nose. If in a contaminated area and the victim is wearing the protective mask, insert the crushed ampules inside the protective mask. If symptoms persist, repeat the treatment, using two crushed ampules about every 4 or 5 minutes until normal breathing returns or until eight ampules have been used. Breathing may become difficult or stop. Seek medical aid quickly. Choking agents. The symptoms of choking- agent poisoning are coughing, choking, tight- ness of the chest, nausea, headache, and water- ing of the eyes. If you have these symptoms, stay quiet and comfortable, but seek medical aid quickly. 5-10"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 CHEMICAL-AGENT DECONTAMINATION OF SOLDIERS AND INDIVIDUAL EQUIPMENT Use the M258A1 skin decontaminating kit to decontaminate your skim individual weapons, and equipment.

That action, called counterintelligence, involves: Denying the enemy information about US plans, intentions, and. activities. Detecting the enemy’s efforts to get information. Deceiving the enemy as to US plans and intentions. SOURCES OF INFORMATION Commanders get information from many agencies, but you are their best agency. You can collect information from the following sources 6-2 Prisoners of war (PW) are an imme- diate source of information. Turn captured soldiers over to your leader quickly. Also, tell him anything you learn from them. Captured documents may contain valuable information about present or future enemy operations. Give such documents to your leader quickly. Enemy activity (the things the enemy is doing) often indicates what he is going to do. Report everything you see the enemy do. Some things that may not seem important to you may be important to your commander. Local civilians often have information about the enemy, terrain, and weather in an area. Report any information gained from civilians. However, you cannot be sure which side the civilians are trying to help, so be careful when acting on information obtained from them. Try to confirm that information by some other means. WHAT TO REPORT Report all information about the enemy to your leader quickly, accurately, and completely. Such reports should answer the questions WHO? WHAT? WHERE? after “WHEN?” It is best to use the “SALUTE” format (size, activity, location, unit, time, and equipment) when reporting. To help you remember details, make notes and draw sketches. Size. Report the number of soldiers and vehi- cles you saw. For example, report ‘‘ 10 enemy infantrymen” (not “a rifle squad”) or ‘‘3 enemy tanks” (not “an enemy tank platoon”). Activity. Report what you saw the enemy doing. For example, “emplacing mines in the road.” Location. Report where you saw the enemy. If you have a map, try to give an eight-digit co- ordinate, such as “GL 874461.” If you do not have a map, relate the location to some key terrain, such as “on the Harm Road, 300 meters south of the Ken River Bridge.” Unit. Report the enemy’s unit. If the unit is not known, report any distinctive features, such as bumper markings on trucks, or type of headgear. Some armies have distinctive uniforms and headgear, or colored tabs on their"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 uniforms, to identify types of units. A unit’s action may also indicate its type. The kind of equipment observed may be peculiar to a certain type of unit. For example, a BRDM may indi- cate a reconnaissance unit. Time. Report the time you saw the enemy activity, not the time you report it. Always report local or Zulu (Z) time. Equipment. Report all of the equipment the enemy is wearing or using. If you do not recog- nize an item of equipment or a type of vehicle, sketch it and submit the sketch with the report. The following is an example of a SALUTE report. FM: 1st Plt, C Co, 2d Bn, 1/73 Inf. TO S2, 2d Bn, 1/73 Inf. Combat OP sighted four enemy tanks moving west along secondary road at grid coordinates NB613397 at 241730Z. Tanks traveling at approximately 5 kilometers per hour. Hatches were open and visible enemy personnel were wearing protective masks. PRISONERS OF WAR AND CAPTURED DOCUMENTS PWs are a good source of information. They must be handled without breaking inter- national law and without losing a chance to gain intelligence. Treat PWs humanely. Do not harm them, either physically or mentally. The senior soldier present is responsible for their care. If PWs cannot be evacuated in a reasonable time, give them food, water, and first aid. Do not give them cigarettes, candy, or other comfort items. PWs who receive favors or are mistreated are poor interrogation subjects. HANDLING PWs In handling PWs, follow the five S’s: 1. Search PWs as soon as they are cap- tured. Take their weapons and papers, except identification papers and pro- tective masks. Give them a written receipt for any personal property and documents taken. Tag documents and personal property to show which PW had them. When searching a PW, have one man guard him while another searches him. (A searcher must not get between a PW and the guard.) To search a PW, have him spread-eagle against a tree or wall, or get into a pushup position with his knees on the ground. Search him, his equipment, his clothing. 6-3"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 2. Segregate PWs into groups by sex and into subgroups such as enlisted personnel, civilians, and political figures. This keeps the leaders from promoting escape efforts. Keep the groups segre- gated as you move them to the rear. 3. Silence PWs and do not let them talk to each other. This keeps them from planning escape and cautioning each other on security. Report anything a PW says or does. 4. Speed PWs to the rear. Turn them over to your leader. He will assemble them and move them to the rear for questioning by the S2. 5. Safeguard PWs when taking them to the rear. Do not let anyone abuse them. Watch out for escape attempts. Do not let PWs bunch up, spread out too far, or start diversions. Such conditions may create a chance for escape. If a PW is wounded and cannot be evacuated through normal channels, turn him over to an aidman to be evacu- ated through medical channels. Before evacuating a PW, attach a tag to him. You can make these tags your- self. The format for the tags is given in the following illustration. The battalion S2 should be able to supply these tags. 6-4"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 HANDLING CAPTURED DOCUMENTS AND EQUIPMENT Enemy documents and equipment are good sources of information. Documents may be official (maps, orders, records, photos) or personal (letters or diaries). If such items are not handled properly, the information in them may become lost or outdated. Give them to your leader quickly. Tag each item using the form shown above. If the item was found on a PW, put that PW’s name on the tag. COUNTERINTELLIGENCE MEASURES The enemy must not get information about US operations. This means that you and your fellow soldiers must: Practice camouflage principles and techniques. Practice noise and light discipline. Practice field sanitation. Use proper radiotelephone procedure. Use the challenge and password properly. Not take personal letters or pictures into combat areas. Not keep diaries in combat areas. Be careful when discussing military affairs (the enemy may be listening). Use only authorized codes. Abide by the Code of Conduct (if captured). Report any soldier or civilian who is believed to be serving or sympathetic with the enemy. Report anyone who tries to get infor- mation about US operations. Destroy all maps or important docu- ments if capture is imminent. Not discuss military operations in public areas. Discuss military operations only with those persons having a need to know the information. Remind fellow soldiers of their coun- terintelligence responsibilities. 6-5"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 CHAPTER 7 Communications GENERAL Communications are exchanges of information by two or more parties.

Each has its own capabilities, advantages, and disadvantages. Those you can use are described in this section. RADIO COMMUNICATIONS Radios are a frequently used means of communications. Radios are particularly suited for use when you are on the move and need a means of maintaining command and control. Small handheld or backpacked radios that com- To put these radios to good use, you must first look at some of the things that affect radio communications. To communicate with each other, radios must have a common frequency. They must also be able to transmit and receive the same type signal. Most infantry radios are FM (frequency modulated) and will not com- municate with AM (amplitude modulated) radios. Squelch settings on the radios must also be used correctly. Factors that affect the range of radio municate for only short distances are found at equipment are weather, terrain, antenna, power, squad and platoon level. As the need grows to and the location of the radio. Trying to commu- talk over greater distances and to more units, nicate near man-made objects such as bridges the size and complexity of radios are increased. and buildings may also affect radio transmis- 7-2"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 sions. Interference in the form of static often occurs when you use radios near powerlines or electrical generators. Interference may also come from other radio stations, bad weather, or enemy jamming. Many of the things that may cause poor radio communications can be corrected by using common sense. Such things as making sure that you are not trying to communicate from under a steel bridge or near generators and power- lines, using the best available antenna for your needs, and selecting the best site for your radio help insure more reliable communications. You can also reduce the effects of enemy jamming by employing antijamming techniques. Radio is one of the least secure means of communicating. Each time you talk over a radio, the sound of your voice travels in all directions. The enemy can listen to your radio transmis- sions while you are communicating with other friendly radio stations. You must always assume that the enemy is listening to get information about you and your unit, or to locate your posi- tion to destroy you with artillery fire. Everyone who uses radios must know the defensive tech- niques available to prevent the enemy from getting information. VISUAL COMMUNICATIONS The enemy’s ability to interfere with your radio signals is causing more emphasis to be placed on visual communications for command and control. Visual signals include arm-and- hand signals, pyrotechnics, smoke, flashing lights, panel markers, and aircraft maneuvers. The effectiveness of any visual signal depends on a set of prearranged meanings. You assign prearranged meanings to visual signals to the soldier sending the signal and the soldier seeing the signal so both have the same understanding of what that particular signal means. Your commander will set prearranged meanings for pyrotechnics, smoke, and flashing lights. Generally, a listing of prear- ranged messages using these signals is con- tained in your unit SOP or communications- electronics operation instructions (CEOI). Panel markers are a series of cloth panels that you spread on the ground to communicate with aircraft. They are useful when you do not have radio contact with friendly aircraft, when ground units and/or aircraft are on radio listen- ing silence, when your radio equipment has been damaged or destroyed, or when enemy jamming makes radio communications difficult or impossible. When standard cloth panels are not available, you can use field expedients such as clothing, branches, rocks, or snow. Panel codes, as well as arm-and-hand signals, have standard prearranged meanings. The prearranged meaning of arm-and-hand signals may be found in FM 21-60. Information is usually taken from those publications and placed in unit CEOIs and SOPs. Visual signals have some shortcomings that limit their use. For example, visual signals can be easily misunderstood. Some visual signals are restricted during poor visibility such as at night or in dense terrain. Of course, at other times, they can be intercepted by the enemy who may, in turn, use similar visual signals to create confusion. SOUND COMMUNICATIONS Sound signals, like visual signals, depend upon a set of prearranged meanings. Sound signals include the use of the voice, whistles, horns, weapons, and other noise-making devices to transmit simple messages over short dis- tances. Also, like visual signals, sound signals 7-3"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 are vulnerable to enemy interception and use. Battle noise can obviously reduce the effective use of sound signals. They have their greatest application as command post warning alarms. The prearranged meanings for sound signals are usually established by local commanders, and a listing of such meanings is commonly found in unit SOPS and the CEOIs. Sound signals, like visual signals, can be easily misunderstood. WIRE COMMUNICATIONS Wire is another type of communications used in infantry units. Although installing a wire network takes more time than installing a radio, wire lines are usually more secure than radio. When you talk over wire lines, your voice travels through the wire lines from one tele- phone to another and is generally not sent through the air. Wire lines will give better com- munications in most cases because they are less subject to interference from weather, terrain, and man-made obstacles. Wire lines also protect you from enemy electronic warfare actions such as jamming. Wire lines are subject to breakage by enemy artillery and air strikes and by friendly forces who accidentally cut the lines when driving over them with tracked and wheeled vehicles. It is important, therefore, to install wire lines properly to reduce the possibility of breakage. When laying wire lines, first consider the tactical situation. In a fast-moving situa- tion, the use of wire may be impractical. In a static situation, you have more time to install wire lines. Consideration must be given to the enemy’s ability to jam radios and to locate positions through direction finding when you communi- cate by radio. If the enemy has displayed such capabilities, wire should be considered as an alternative to radio. The terrain will also influ- ence use of wire communications. Wire laying may be difficult in dense vegetation, in swampy areas, or in mountainous terrain. Rain, snow, and temperature extremes may also influence wire laying. Men and equipment to lay wire lines should be available. MESSENGER COMMUNICATIONS Unlike other infantry communications, messengers are a means of transmitting large maps, documents, and bulk material, as well as oral or written messages. Message centers serve as a central point for receiving and distributing message-type information. They are located at battalion or higher level headquarters. Messen- ger service may be limited, however, because messengers are subject to enemy action, require more time than radio or wire communications, and do not afford real time writer-to-reader exchanges. RADIOTELEPHONE PROCEDURE Radiotelephone procedure is a set proce- dure for using a radio or telephone. It speeds the exchange of messages and helps avoid errors. The rules listed below will help you use trans- mission times efficiently and avoid violations of communications security. 1. Transmit clear, complete, and concise messages. When possible, write them out beforehand. 2. Speak clearly, slowly, and in natural phrases. Enunciate each word. If a re- ceiving operator must write the message, allow time for him to do so. 3. Listen before transmitting, to avoid interfering with other transmissions. 4. ALWAYS ASSUME THE ENEMY IS LISTENING. 7-4"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 PHONETIC ALPHABET To help identify spoken letters, a set of easily understood words has been selected. Those words help to avoid confusion. BRAVO, for example, is the phonetic word of the letter B, and DELTA is the phonetic word for the letter D. BRAVO and DELTA are less likely to be confused in a radio message than B and D. Use the phonetic alphabet to: Transmit isolated letters. Transmit each letter of an abbrevia- tion.

Your leaders will often have you lay the wire and install and operate the field phones. WIRE-LAYING TECHNIQUES A surface line is field wire laid on the ground. Lay surface lines loosely with plenty of slack. Slack makes installation and main- tenance easier. Surface lines take less time and fewer soldiers to install. When feasible, dig small trenches for the wire to protect it from shell fragments of artillery or mortar rounds. Conceal wire routes crossing open areas from enemy observation. Tag all wire lines at switch- boards and at road, trail, and rail crossings to identify the lines and make repair easier if a line is cut. An overhead line is field wire laid above the ground. Lay overhead lines near command posts, in assembly areas, and along roads where heavy vehicular traffic may drive off the road. Also, lay them at road crossings where trenches cannot be dug, if culverts or bridges are not available. Those lines are the least likely to be damaged by vehicles or weather. The telephone set TA-1 is a sound-powered phone that has both a visual and an audible signal. It has a range of 6.4 km using WD-1 wire. To install the TA-1 telephone: Strip away half an inch of insulation from each strand of the WD-1 wire line. Depress the spring-loaded line bind- ing posts and insert one strand of the wire into each post. Adjust signal volume control knob to LOUD. Depress the generator lever several times to call the other operator and listen for buzzer sound. Turn the buzzer volume control knob until the wanted volume is obtained. Look at the visual indicator to see if it shows four white luminous markings. Depress the push-to-talk switch to reset the visual indicator. 7-15"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 The telephone set TA-312 is a battery- powered phone.

You may need your own items later if you become injured. For more information on first aid, see FM 21-11. LIFESAVING MEASURES When you or your buddy is wounded, first aid must be given at once. The first step is to apply (as needed) the four life-saving measures. These measures are: Clear the airway; cheek and restore breathing and heartbeat. Stop the bleeding. Prevent shock.

The lack of oxygen intake through breathing and lack of heartbeat leads to death in a very few minutes. When treating a casualty, first find out if he is breathing. If he is not breathing Place him on his back and kneel beside his head. Clear his airway by removing any ob- struction in his mouth. Place your hand (the hand nearest his feet) under his neck and put your other hand on his forehead. Extend his neck by lifting with the hand under the neck and pushing down on the forehead. This also lifts the tongue away from the back of the throat, opening the airway. 8-3"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 Check for Breathing. After opening the airway, LOOK, LISTEN, and FEEL to find out if the casualty is breathing. The following procedures should be used: Put your ear near the casualty’s mouth and nose: hold this position for about 5 seconds. LOOK to see if the casualty’s chest is rising and falling. LISTEN and FEEL for breathing. Restore Breathing. IF THERE ARE NO SIGNS OF BREATHING, START MOUTH- TO-MOUTH RESUSCITATION AT ONCE.

Repeat this procedure once every 5 seconds until the casualty exhales. 8-5"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 If you feel strong resistance when you first blow air into the casualty’s mouth, quickly reposition his head and try again. If the airway is still not clear, roll him onto his side. Hit him sharply between his shoulder blades with the heel of your hand to dislodge any foreign objects. If the casualty’s abdomen bulges (air going into stomach), apply gentle pressure on his abdomen with one hand to force the air out. If this makes the casualty vomit, quickly turn him onto his side, clean out his mouth, and con- tinue giving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Check for Heartbeat. When you find an un- conscious casualty, check to see if he has a heartbeat and if he is breathing. To check for heartbeat, use the following procedures: Tilt the casualty’s head back. Place your fingers on his throat. Feel for the Adam’s apple. Slide the fingers down from the Adam’s apple to the side of the throat. This will place the fingertips over an artery, where the pulse can be felt. 8-6"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 Restore Heartbeat. You must start external heart massage quickly, as permanent damage to the brain may occur if it is deprived of oxygen- ated blood. Examples of times without oxygen and likelihood of brain damage are listed below: External heart massage provides artificial circulation by squeezing the heart between the breastbone and the backbone, forcing blood through the lungs, brain, and body. To perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and external heart massage at the same time: Kneel at the casualty’s side. Blow four quick but full breaths into the casualty (as described earlier) to fill the lungs with air (his head must be tilted back and his airway open). Locate the tip of the breastbone and measure two finger-widths up from that tip. Place the heel of the other hand along side the fingers. Then, put both hands together and interlace the fingers. Push downward on the chest 15 times at a rate of 80 counts per minute. 8-7"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 Lean forward with the elbows locked. That will compress the casualty’s chest about 1½ to 2 inches. Then re- lease the pressure on the chest. After each 15 compressions, shift posi- tions slightly and give him 2 quick, but full, breaths. Continue this 15 to 2 ratio: Until the casualty can breathe by himself and his pulse returns. Until relieved by someone. Until the casualty is dead. If two of you are present, one should give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and the other should give heart massage. In that case, the procedure is slightly different. The soldier giving the heart massage should change the number of compressions from 15 at a time to 5, keeping the 80-per-minute rate. The soldier giving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, should give 2 breaths after each 5 compressions. 8-8"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 STOP THE BLEEDING If the casualty is breathing and his heart is beating, the next thing to do is to stop the bleeding of the wound.

Shock may result from any injury, but is more likely to result from a severe injury. Warning signs of shock are restlessness, thirst, pale skin, and rapid heartbeat. A casualty in shock may be excited or appear calm and tired. He may be sweating when his skin feels cool take small, fast breaths or gasps; stare blindly into space or become blotchy or bluish around his mouth. After giving the casualty the first two lifesaving measures, look for signs of shock. If the casualty is in shock or is about to go into shock, treat him at once for shock. To treat for shock, proceed as follows: Loosen the casualty’s clothing at the neck, waist, and wherever it restricts and clammy. As his condition worsens, he may circulation. 8-14"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 Reassure the casualty by being calm and self-confident. Assure him that he will be taken care of. Place the casualty in a comfortable posi- tion. His position depends on his condition. If he is conscious, place him on his back with his feet raised 15 to 20 cm (6 to 8 in). If he is unconscious, place him on his side or abdomen with his head turned to the side. If he has a head wound, raise his head higher than his body. If he has a wound of the face and/or neck, set him up and lean him forward with his head down or in the position for an unconscious casualty. If he has a sucking chest wound, set him up or lay him down on the injured side. If he has an abdominal wound, lay him on his back with his head turned to the side. Keep the casualty warm. It may be neces- sary to place ponchos or blankets under and over him. DRESS AND BANDAGE THE WOUND The healing of wounds and recovery depend a lot on how well you initially protect the wound from contamination and infection. A wound must be dressed and bandaged to protect it from further contamination, as well as to stop the bleeding. Use the field first-aid dressing in the first-aid packet to dress’ and bandage a wound. A dressing is any sterile pad used to cover a wound. A bandage is any material used to secure a dressing to a wound. The field first-aid dressing already has bandages attached to it. Use the dressing to cover a wound and the bandages to secure the dressing to it.

DO reassure the casualty and gently examine him to determine the needed first aid. DO give lifesaving measures as re- quired. DON’T position a soldier on his back if he is unconscious or has a wound on his face or neck. DON’T remove clothing from an injured soldier by pulling or tearing it off. DON’T touch or try to clean dirty wounds, including burns. DON’T remove dressings and band- ages once they have been put on a wound. DON’T loosen a tourniquet once it has been applied.

PERSONAL HYGIENE Personal hygiene consists of practices which safeguard your health and that of others. It is often thought of as being the same as per- sonal cleanliness. While cleanliness is important, it is only one part of healthy living. Personal hygiene is important to you because: It protects against disease-causing germs that are present in all environ- ments. It keeps disease-causing germs from spreading. It promotes health among soldiers. It improves morale. PERSONAL CLEANLINESS Skin. Wash your body frequently from head to foot with soap and water. If no tub or shower is available, wash with a cloth and soapy water, paying particular attention to armpits, groin area, face, ears, hands, and feet. Hair. Keep your hair clean, neatly combed, and trimmed. At least once a week, wash your hair and entire scalp with soap and water. Also, shave as often as the water supply and tactical situation permit. Do not share combs or shaving equipment with other soldiers. Hands. Wash your hands with soap and water after any dirty work, after each visit to the latrine, and before eating. Keep your fingernails closely trimmed and clean. Do not bite your fingernails, pick your nose, or scratch your body. Clothing and Sleeping Gear. Wash or exchange clothing when it becomes dirty (situation per- mitting). Wash or exchange sleeping gear when"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 it becomes dirty. If clothing and sleeping gear cannot be washed or exchanged, shake them and air them regularly in the sun. That greatly reduces the number of germs on them. CARE OF THE MOUTH AND TEETH CARE OF THE FEET Wash and dry your feet daily. Use foot powder on your feet to help kill germs, reduce friction on the skin, and absorb perspiration. Socks should be changed daily. After crossing a wet area, dry your feet, put on foot powder, and change socks, as soon as the situation permits. Regular and proper cleaning of the mouth and the teeth helps prevent tooth decay and gum disease. The most healthful oral hygiene is to clean your mouth and teeth thoroughly and correctly after each meal with a toothbrush and toothpaste. If a toothbrush is not available, cut a twig from a tree and fray it on one end to serve as a toothbrush. If mouthwash is avail- able, use it to help kill germs in your mouth. To help remove food from between your teeth, use dental floss or toothpicks. Twigs can also be used for toothpicks. FOOD AND DRINK For proper development, strength, and survival, your body requires: Proteins. Fats and carbohydrates. Minerals. Vitamins. Water. 8-17"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 Issued rations have those essential food substances in the right amounts and proper balance. So, eat primarily those rations. When feasible, heat your meals. That will make them taste better and will reduce the energy required to digest them. Do not overindulge in sweets, soft drinks, alcoholic beverages, and other non- issued rations. Those rarely have nutritional value and are often harmful. Drink water only from approved water sources or after it has been treated with water- purification tablets. To purify water from rivers or streams: Fill your canteen with water (be care- ful not to get trash or other objects in your canteen). Add one purification tablet per quart of clear water or two tablets per quart of cloudy or very cold water. (If you are out of tablets, use boiling water that has been boiled for 5 minutes.) Replace the cap loosely. Wait 5 minutes. Shake the canteen well and allow some of the water to leak out. Tighten the cap. Wait an additional 20 minutes before drinking the water. EXERCISE Exercise of the muscles and joints helps to maintain physical fitness and good health. Without that, you may lack the physical stamina and ability to fight. Physical fitness includes a healthy body, the capacity for skill- ful and sustained performance, the ability to recover from exertion rapidly, the desire to complete a designated task, and the confidence to face any eventuality. Your own safety, health, and life may depend on your physical fitness. There are lulls in combat when you will not be active. During such lulls, exercise. That helps to keep the muscles and body functions ready for the next period of combat. It also helps pass the time in the lulls. REST Your body needs regular periods of rest to restore physical and mental vigor. When you are tired, your body functions are sluggish, and your ability to react is slower than normal. That also makes you more susceptible to sickness. For good health, 6 to 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep each day is desirable. As that is seldom possible in combat, use rest periods and off-duty time to rest or sleep. Do not be ashamed to say that you are tired or sleepy. Do not, however, sleep when on duty. MENTAL HYGIENE The way you think affects the way you act. If you know your job, you will probably act quickly and effectively. If you are uncertain or doubtful of your ability to do your job, you may hesitate and make wrong decisions. Positive thinking is a necessity. You must enter combat with absolute confidence in your ability to do your job. Fear is a basic human emotion. It is both a mental and physical state. Fear is not shameful if it is controlled. It can even help you by making you more alert and more able to do your job. Fear makes the pupils of your eyes enlarge, which increases your field of vision so you can detect movement more easily. Fear also increases your rate of breathing and heartbeat. That increases your strength. Therefore, control your fear and use it to your advantage. Do not let your imagination and fear run wild. Remember, you are not alone. You are part of a team. There are other soldiers nearby, even though they cannot always be seen. Everyone must help each other and depend on each other. 8-18"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 Worry undermines the body, dulls the mind, and slows down thinking and learning. It adds to confusion, magnifies troubles, and causes you to imagine things which really do not exist. If you are worried about something, talk to your leader about it. He may be able to help solve the problem. You may have to fight in any part of the world and in all types of terrain. Therefore, adjust your mind to accept conditions as they are. If mentally prepared for it, you should be able to fight under almost any conditions. RULES FOR AVOIDING ILLNESS IN THE FIELD Don’t consume foods and beverages from unauthorized sources. Don’t soil the ground with urine or feces. (Use a latrine or “cat-hole.”) Keep your fingers and contaminated objects out of your mouth. Wash your hands following any con- tamination, before eating or preparing food, and before cleaning your mouth and teeth. Wash all mess gear after each meal. Clean your mouth and teeth at least once each day. Avoid insect bites by wearing proper clothing and using insect repellents. Avoid getting wet or chilled unneces- sarily. Don’t share personal items (canteens, pipes, toothbrushes, washcloths, towels, and shaving gear) with other soldiers. Don’t leave food scraps lying around. Sleep when possible.

One way is to probe for and mark mines to clear a footpath through the minefield. PROBING FOR MINES Remove your helmet, load-carrying equipment (LCE), watch, rings, belt, dog tags, and anything else that may hinder movement or fall off. Leave your rifle and equipment with another soldier in the team. Get a wooden stick about 30 cm (12 in) long for a probe and sharpen one of the ends. Do not use a metal probe. Place the unsharpened end of the probe in the palm of one hand with your fingers extended and your thumb hold- ing the probe. Probe every 5 cm (2 in) across a l-meter front. Push the probe gently into the ground at an angle less than 45 degrees. Kneel (or lie down) and feel upward and forward with your free hand to find tripwires and pressure prongs before starting to probe. Put just enough pressure on the probe to sink it slowly into the ground. If the probe does not go into the ground.

Mark it and report its exact location to your leader. There are several ways to mark a mine. How it is marked is not as important as having everyone understand the marking. A common way to mark a mine is to tie a piece of paper, cloth, or engineer tape to a stake and put the stake in the ground by the mine.

After the far side is secure, the rest of the unit should cross. C-4"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 HOW TO BREACH AND CROSS WIRE OBSTACLES The enemy uses wire obstacles to separate infantry from tanks and to slow or stop in- fantry. His wire obstacles are similar to ours. To breach them, you should use wire cutters and bangalore torpedoes. Breaching a wire obstacle may require stealth; for example, when done by a patrol. It may not require stealth during an attack. Breaches requiring stealth are normally done with wire cutters. Other breaches are normally done with bangalore torpedoes and wire cutters. CUTTING THE WIRE To cut through a wire obstacle with stealth Cut only the lower strands and leave the top strand in place. That makes it less likely that the enemy will discover the gap. Cut the wire near a picket. To reduce the noise of a cut, have another soldier wrap cloth around the wire and hold the wire with both hands. Cut part of the way through the wire between the other soldier’s hands and have him bend the wire back and forth until it breaks. If you are alone, wrap cloth around the wire near a picket, partially cut the wire, and then bend and break the wire. To breach an obstacle made of concertina: Cut the wire and stake it back to keep the breach open. Stake the wire back far enough to allow room to crawl through or under the obstacle. C-5"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 To CROSSING THE WIRE crawl under a wire obstacle: Slide headfirst on your back. Push forward with your heels. Carry your weapon lengthwise on your body and steady it with one hand. To keep the wire from snagging on your clothes and equipment, let it slide along your weapon. Feel ahead with your free hand to find the next strand of wire and any trip wires or mines. To cross over a wire obstacle: Stay crouched down low. Feel and look for tripwires and mines. Grasp the first wire strand lightly, and cautiously lift one leg over the wire. C-6"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 Lower your foot to the ground. Lift your other foot over the wire and lower it to the ground. Release the wire and feel for the next strand. To speed up a crossing, put boards or grass mats over the wire and cross on them. USING A BANGALORE TORPEDO A bangalore torpedo comes in a kit that has 10 torpedo sections, 10 connecting sleeves, and 1 nose sleeve. Use only the number of tor- pedo sections and connecting sleeves needed. All torpedo sections have a threaded cap well at each end so that they may be assembled in any order. Use the connecting sleeves to con- nect the torpedo sections together. To prevent early detonation of the entire bangalore torpedo if you hit a mine while pushing it through the obstacle, attach an improvised (wooden) torpedo section to its end. That section can be made out of any wooden pole or stick that is the size of a real torpedo section. Attach the nose sleeve to the end of the wooden section.

The rapid movement and low silhouette keep the enemy from getting a good shot at you. HOW TO MOVE AROUND A CORNER Before moving around a corner, check out the area beyond it to see if it is clear of obstacles and the enemy. Do not expose yourself when checking out that area. Lie flat on the ground and do not expose your weapon beyond the cor- ner. With your steel helmet on, look around the corner at ground level only enough to see around it.

Use shadows if possible, and stay low. Move quickly from covered position to covered position. HOW TO CROSS OPEN AREAS Whenever possible, you should avoid kill zones such as streets, alleys, and parks. They are natural kill zones for enemy machine guns. When you must cross an open area, do it quickly. Use the shortest route across the area. Use smoke to conceal your move and have someone overwatch you. If you must go from point A to point C, as depicted in the illustration, do not move from point A straight to point C. This is the longest route across the open area and gives the enemy more time to track and hit you.

They are often booby trapped and are probably covered by enemy fire.

Throw a hand grenade before enter- ing a door, window, room, hall, stairwell, or any other entry point. Before throwing a hand grenade, let it cook off for 2 seconds. That keeps the enemy from throwing it back before it explodes. To cook off a hand grenade remove your thumb from the safety lever; allow the lever to rotate out and away from the grenade; then count one thousand one, one thousand two, and throw it. The best way to put a grenade into an upper-story opening is to use a grenade launcher. When you throw a hand grenade into an opening, stay close to the building, using it for cover. Before you throw the hand grenade, select a safe place to move to in case the hand grenade does not go into the opening or in case the enemy throws it back. Once you throw the hand grenade, take cover. After the hand grenade explodes, move into the building quickly. HOW TO USE FIGHTING POSITIONS Fighting positions in urban areas are different from those in other types of terrain. They are not always prepared as discussed in chapter 2. In some cases, you must use hasty fighting positions which are no more than what- ever cover is available. CORNERS OF BUILDINGS When using a corner of a building as a fighting position, you must be able to fire from either shoulder.

WINDOWS When using a window as a fighting posi- tion, do not use a standing position, as it exposes most of your body. Standing may also silhou- ette you against a light-colored interior wall or a window on the other side of the building. Do not let the muzzle of your rifle extend beyond the window, as that may give away your posi- tion. The enemy may see the muzzle or the flash of the rifle.

To improve the cover provided by a win- dow, barricade the window but leave a small hole to fire through. Also barricade other windows around your position. That keeps the enemy from knowing which windows are being used for fighting positions. Use boards from the interior walls of the building or any other material to barricade the window. The barricade material should be put on in an irregular pattern so that the enemy cannot determine which window is being used. Place sandbags below and on the sides of the window to reinforce it and to add cover. Remove all the glass in the window to prevent injury from flying glass.

However, you must develop the following traits and qualities: Be patient. Be able to move slowly and quietly, yet steadily, while detecting and inter- preting signs. Avoid fast movement that may cause you to overlook signs, lose the trail, or blunder into an enemy unit. Be persistent and have the skill and desire to continue the mission even though signs are scarce or weather or terrain is unfavorable. Be determined and persistent when trying to find a trail that you have lost. Be observant and try to see things that are not obvious at first glance. Use your senses of smell and hearing to supplement your sight. Develop a feel for things that do not look right. It may help you regain a lost trail or discover additional signs. Know the enemy, his habits, equip- ment, and capability. FUNDAMENTALS OF TRACKING When tracking an enemy, you should build a picture of him in your mind. Ask yourself such questions as: How many persons am I following? How well are they trained? How are they equipped? Are they healthy? How is their morale? Do they know they are being followed? E-2 To find the answer to such questions, use all available signs. A sign can be anything that shows you that a certain act took place at a particular place and time. For instance, a foot- print tells a tracker that at a certain time a person walked on that spot. The six fundamentals of tracking are: Displacement. Staining. Weathering. Littering. Camouflaging. Interpretation and/or immediate use intelligence. Any sign that you find can be identified as one or more of the first five fundamentals. In the sixth fundamental, you combine the first five and use all of them to form a picture of the enemy. DISPLACEMENT Displacement takes place when something is moved from its original position. An example is a footprint in soft, moist ground. The foot of the person that left the print displaced the soil, leaving an indentation in the ground. By studying the print, you can determine many facts. For example, a print that was left by a barefoot person or a person with worn or frayed footgear indicates that he may have poor equipment. HOW TO ANALYZE FOOTPRINTS Footprints show the following: The direction and rate of movement of a party."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 The number of persons in a party. a heavy load is probably being carried by the person who left the prints.

E-3"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 The last person walking in a group usually leaves the clearest footprints. Therefore, use his prints as the key set. Cut a stick the length of each key print and notch the stick to show the print width at the widest part of the sole. Study the angle of the key prints to determine the direction of march. Look for an identifying mark or feature on the prints, such as a worn or frayed part of the footwear. If the trail becomes vague or obliterated, or if the trail being followed merges with another, use the stick to help iden- tify the key prints. That will help you stay on the trail of the group being followed. Use the box method to count the number of persons in the group. There are two ways to use the box method — the stride as a unit of measure method and the 36-inch box method. The stride as a unit of measure method is the most accurate of the two. Up to 18 persons can be counted using this method. Use it when the key prints can be determined. To use this method, identify a key print on a trail and draw a line from its heel across the trail. Then move forward to the key print of the opposite foot and draw a line through its instep. This should form a box with the edges of the trail forming two sides, and the drawn lines forming the other two sides. Next, count every print or partial print inside the box to determine the E-4"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 number of persons. Any person walking nor- mally would have stepped in the box at least one time. Count the key prints as one. To use the 36-inch box method, mark off a 30- to 36-inch cross section of a trail, count the prints in the box, then divide by two to determine the number of persons that used the trail. (Your M16 rifle is 39 inches long and may be used as a measuring device.) OTHER SIGNS OF DISPLACEMENT Footprints are only one example of dis- placement. Displacement occurs when any- thing is moved from its original position. Other examples are such things as foliage, moss, vines, sticks, or rocks that are moved from their origi- nal places; dew droplets brushed from leaves; stones and sticks that are turned over and show a different color underneath; and grass or other vegetation that is bent or broken in the direction of movement.

When you clear a trail by either breaking or cutting your way through heavy vegetation, you displace the vegetation. Displacement signs can be made while you stop to rest with heavy loads. The prints made by the equipment you carry can help to identify its type. When loads are set down at a rest halt or campsite, grass and twigs may be crushed. A sleeping man may also flatten the vegetation. In most areas, there will be insects. Any changes in the normal life of these insects may be a sign that someone has recently passed through the area. Bees that are stirred up, and holes that are covered by someone moving over them, or spider webs that are torn down are good clues. If a person uses a stream to cover his trail, algae and water plants may be displaced in E-6 slippery footing or in places where he walks carelessly. Rocks may be displaced from their original position, or turned over to show a lighter or darker color on their opposite side. A person entering or leaving a stream may create slide marks, wet banks, or footprints, or he may scuff bark off roots or sticks. Normally, a person or animal will seek the path of least resistance. Therefore, when you search a stream for exit signs, look for open places on the banks or other places where it would be easy to leave the stream. STAINING A good example of staining is the mark left by blood from a bleeding wound. Bloodstains often will be in the form of drops left by a wounded person. Blood signs are found on the ground and smeared on leaves or twigs."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 You can determine the location of a wound on a man being followed by studying the blood- stains. If the blood seems to be dripping stead- ily, it probably came from a wound on his trunk. A wound in the lungs will deposit bloodstains that are pink, bubbly, frothy. A bloodstain deposited from a head wound will appear heavy, wet, and slimy, like gelatin. Abdominal wounds often mix blood with digestive juices so that the deposit will have an odor. The stains will be light in color. Staining can also occur when a person walks over grass, stones, and shrubs with muddy boots. Thus, staining and displacement together may give evidence of movement and indicate the direction taken. Crushed leaves may stain rocky ground that is too hard for footprints. Roots, stones, and vines may be stained by crushed leaves or berries when walked on. Yellow stains in snow may be urine marks left by personnel in the area. In some cases, it may be hard to determine the difference between staining and displace- ment. Both terms can be applied to some signs. For example, water that has been muddied may indicate recent movement. The mud has been displaced and it is staining the water. Stones in streams may be stained by mud from boots. Algae can be displaced from stones in streams and can stain other stones or bark. Water in footprints in swampy ground may be muddy if the tracks are recent. In time, however, the mud will settle and the water will clear. The clarity of the water can be used to esti- mate the age of the prints. Normally, the mud will clear in 1 hour. That will vary with terrain. WEATHERING Weather may either aid or hinder track- ing. It affects signs in ways that help determine how old they are, but wind, snow, rain, and sunlight can also obliterate signs completely. By studying the effects of weather on signs, you can determine the age of the sign. For example, when bloodstains are fresh, they may be bright red. Air and sunlight will change the appearance of blood first to a deep ruby-red color, and then to a dark brown crust when the moisture evaporates. Scuff marks on trees or bushes darken with time. Sap oozes from fresh cuts on trees but it hardens when exposed to the air. FOOTPRINTS Footprints are greatly affected by weather. When a foot displaces soft, moist soil to form a print, the moisture holds the edges of the print intact and sharp. As sunlight and air dry the edges of the print, small particles that were held in place by the moisture fall into the print, making the edges appear rounded. Study this process carefully to estimate the age of a print. If particles are just beginning to fall into a print, it is probably fresh. If the edges of the print are dried and crusty, the prints are probably at least an hour old. The effects of weather will vary with the terrain, so this information is furnished as a guide only. A light rain may round out the edges of a print. Try to remember when the last rain occurred in order to put prints into a proper time frame. A heavy rain may erase all signs. Wind also affects prints. Besides drying out a print, the wind may blow litter, sticks, or leaves into it. Try to remember the wind activity in order to help determine the age of a print. For example, you may think, “It is calm now, but the wind blew hard an hour ago. These prints have litter blown into them, so they must be over an hour old.” You must be sure, however, that the litter was blown into the prints, and was not crushed into them when the prints were made. Trails leaving streams may appear to be weathered by rain because of water running E-7"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 into the footprints from wet clothing or equip- ment. This is particularly true if a party leaves a stream in a file. From this formation, each person drips water into the prints. A wet trail slowly fading into a dry trail indicates that the trail is fresh. WIND, SOUNDS, AND ODORS Wind affects sounds and odors. If the wind is blowing from the direction of a trail you are following, sounds and odors are carried to you. If the wind is blowing in the same direction as the trail you are following, you must be cautious as the wind will carry your sounds toward the enemy. To find the wind direction, drop a hand- ful of dry dirt or grass from shoulder height. To help you decide where a sound is coming from, cup your hands behind your ears and slowly turn. When the sound is loudest, you are probably facing the origin of sound. When moving, try to keep the wind in your face. SUN You must also consider the effects of the sun. It is hard to look or aim directly into the sun. If possible, keep the sun at your back. LITTERING Poorly trained units may leave trails of litter as they move. Gum or candy wrappers, ration cans, cigarette butts, remains of fires, or human feces are unmistakable signs of recent movement. Weather affects litter. Rain may flatten or wash litter away, or turn paper into pulp. Winds may blow litter away from its original location. Ration cans exposed to weather will rust. They first rust at the exposed edge where they were opened. Rust then moves in toward the center. Use your memory to determine the age of litter. The last rain or strong wind can be the basis of a time frame. CAMOUFLAGE If a party knows that you are tracking it, it will probably use camouflage to conceal its movement and to slow and confuse you. Doing so, however, will slow it down. Walking back- ward, brushing out trails, and moving over rocky ground or through streams are examples of camouflage that can be used to confuse you. The party may move on hard surfaced, frequently traveled roads or try to merge with traveling civilians. Examine such routes with extreme care, because a well-defined approach that leads to the enemy will probably be mined, ambushed, or covered by snipers. The party may try to avoid leaving a trail. Its members may wrap rags around their boots, or wear soft-soled shoes to make the edges of their footprints rounder and less dis- tinct. The party may exit a stream in column or line to reduce the chance of leaving a well- defined exit. If the party walks backward to leave a confusing trail, the footprints will be deepened at the toe, and the soil will be scuffed or dragged in the direction of movement. If a trail leads across rocky or hard ground, try to work around that ground to pick up the exit trail. This process works in streams as well. On rocky ground, moss or lichens growing on the stones could be displaced by even the most careful evader. If you lose the trail, return to the last visible sign. From there, head in the direction of the party’s movement. Move in ever-widening circles until you find some signs to follow. INTERPRETATION/IMMEDIATE USE INTELLIGENCE When reporting, do not report your inter- pretations as facts. Report that you have seen E-8"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 signs of certain things, not that those things actually exist. Report all information quickly. The term “immediate use intelligence” includes infor- mation of the enemy that can be put to use at once to gain surprise, to keep the enemy off balance, or to keep him from escaping an area. A commander has many sources of intelligence. He puts the information from those sources together to help determine where an enemy is, what he may be planning, and where he may be going. Information you report gives your leader definite information on which he can act at once. For example, you may report that your leader is 30 minutes behind an enemy unit, that the enemy is moving north, and that he is now at a certain place. That gives your leader infor- mation on which he can act at once. He could then have you keep on tracking and move another unit to attack the enemy. If a trail is found that has signs of recent enemy activity, your leader can set up an ambush on it. TRACKING TEAMS Your unit may form tracking teams. The lead team of a moving unit can be a tracking team, or a separate unit may be a tracking team. There are many ways to organize such teams, and they can be any size. There should, however, be a leader, one or more trackers, and security for the trackers. A typical organization has three trackers, three security men, and a team leader with a radiotelephone operator (RATELO). When a team is moving, the best tracker should be in the lead, followed by his security. The two other trackers should be on the flanks, each one followed and overmatched by his security. The leader should be where he can best control the team. The RATELO should be with the leader. E-9"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 TRACKER DOGS Tracker dogs may be used to help track an enemy. Tracker dogs are trained and used by their handlers. A dog tracks human scent and the scent of disturbed vegetation caused by man’s passing. Tracker dogs should be used with tracker teams. The team can track visually, and the dog and handler can follow. If the team loses the signs, then the dog can take over. A dog can track faster than a man tracks, and a dog can track at night. A tracker dog is trained not to bark and give away the team. It is also trained to avoid baits, cover odors, and deodorants used to throw it off the track. COUNTERTRACKING In addition to knowing how to track, you must know how to counter an enemy tracker’s efforts to track you. Some countertracking techniques are discussed in the following paragraphs: While moving from close terrain to open terrain, walk past a big tree (30 cm [12 in] in diameter or larger) toward the open area for three to five paces. Then walk backward to the for- ward side of the tree and make a 90-degree change of direction, passing the tree on its forward side. Step care- fully and leave as little sign as possible. If this is not the direction that you want to go, change direction again about 50 meters away using the same technique. The purpose of this is to draw the enemy tracker into the open area where it is harder for him to track. That also exposes him and causes him to search the wrong area. When approaching a trail (about 100 meters from it), change your direction of movement and approach it at a E-10"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 45-degree angle.

Then move about 100 meters at an angle of 45 degrees, but this time on the other side of the trail and in the reverse of your approach. When changing direc- tion back to your original line of march, the big tree technique can be used. The purpose of this technique is to draw the enemy tracker along the easier trail.

There are several courses of action you may take to avoid capture and rejoin your unit. You may stay in your current position and wait for friendly troops to find you. This may be a good course of action if you are sure that friendly units will continue to operate in the area, and if there are a lot of enemy units in this area. You may break out to a friendly area. This may be a good course of action if you know where a friendly area is, and if the enemy is widely dispersed. You may move farther into enemy territory to temporarily conduct guerrilla-type opera- tions. This is a short-term course of action to be taken only when other courses of action are not feasible. This may be a good course of action when the enemy area is known to be lightly held, or when there is a good chance of linking up with friendly guerrillas. You may combine two or more of these. For example, you may stay in your current position until the enemy moves out of the area and then break out to a friendly area. There may be times when you will have to kill, stun, or capture an enemy soldier without alerting other enemy in the area. At such times, a rifle or pistol makes too much noise, and you will use a silent weapon. Some silent weapons are: F-2 The bayonet. The garotte (a choke wire or cord with handles). Improvised clubs. In day or night, the successful use of silent weapons requires great skill and stealthy movement. RESISTANCE The Code of Conduct is an expression of the ideals and principles which traditionally have guided and strengthened American fight- ing men and the United States. It prescribes the manner in which every soldier of the United States armed forces must conduct himself when captured or when faced with the possibility of capture. You should never surrender of your own free will. Likewise, a leader should never sur- render the soldiers under his command while they still have the means to resist. If captured, you must continue to resist in every way you can. Some rules to follow are: Make every effort to escape and to help others escape. Do not accept special favors from the enemy.

Do not answer any questions other than those concerning your name, rank, social security number, and date of birth. ESCAPE Escape is the action you take to get away"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 from the enemy if you are captured. The best time for you to escape is right after you are captured. You will probably be in your best physical condition at that time. Prison rations are usually barely enough to sustain life, cer- tainly not enough to build up a reserve of energy. The physical treatment, medical care, and rations of prison life quickly cause physical weakness, night blindness, and loss of coordina- tion and reasoning power. The following are other reasons for making an early escape: Friendly fire or air strikes may cause enough confusion and disorder to pro- tide a chance of escape. The first guards you have probably will not be as well trained in handling prisoners as guards farther back. Some of the first guards may be walk- ing wounded who are distracted by their own condition. You know something about the area where you are captured and may know the locations of nearby friendly units. The way you escape depends on what you can think of to fit the situation. The only general rules are to escape early and escape when the enemy is distracted. Once you have escaped, it may not be easy to contact friendly troops — even when you know where they are. You should contact a friendly unit as you would if you were a member of a lost patrol. You should time your move- ment so that you pass through enemy units at night and arrive at a friendly unit at dawn. A good way to make contact is to find a ditch or F-3"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 shallow hole to hide in where you have cover from both friendly and enemy fire. At dawn, you should attract the attention of the friendly unit by waving a white cloth, shouting, showing a panel, or some other way. This should alert the friendly unit and prepare it to accept you. After the unit has been alerted, you should shout who you are, what your situation is, and ask for permission to move toward the unit. SECURITY In combat, you must always think of security. You must do everything possible for the security of yourself and your unit. The following are some basic things to do for security: Be awake and alert. Stay dressed and ready for action. Keep your equipment packed when it is not being used. Keep your equipment and weapon in good operating condition. Use camouflage. Move around only when necessary. Stay as quiet as possible. Look and listen for enemy activity in your sector. Use lights only when necessary. Do not write information about an operation on your map. Do not take notes or papers about an operation into combat. Do not take personal items into combat. Do not leave trash lying about. Tie or tape down equipment to keep it from rattling. Use challenge and password. Do not give military information to strangers. Remember the Code of Conduct. F-4"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 APPENDIX G Weapons And Fire Control GENERAL You must know how to fire your weapon and how to control your fire.

The most stable firing positions G-6"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 for firing LAWs are the standing supported, prone, and prone supported. The M72A2 LAW consists of a 66-mm HEAT (high explosive antitank) rocket in a disposable fiberglass and aluminum launcher tube. Its light weight and its ability to pene- trate more than 30 cm (12 in) of armor make it useful against enemy armor, bunkers, and other hard targets out to a range of 200 meters. The four methods of engagement with a LAW are single, sequence, pair, and volley firing. The two best methods of engagement are volley firing and pair firing. Single firing. In single firing, you fire at a target with only one LAW. This method is used only at ranges of 50 meters or less. Beyond that range, single firing is ineffective, as the chance of a first-round hit is low. Sequence firing. In sequence firing, you pre- pare several launchers for firing. After firing the first LAW, note its impact. If you get a hit, continue to fire, using the same sight picture, until the target is destroyed. If the first round is a miss, adjust the range and lead of succeeding rounds until you get a hit. Then continue to fire until the target is destroyed. Pair firing. In pair firing, you and another gunner prepare two or more LAWs each, and fire at a target one at a time. You swap infor- mation when firing at the target. The gunner seeing a target identifies it and gives the esti- mated range and lead he will use (for example, TANK, 150 METERS, FAST TARGET), then fires. If the first gunner misses, the second gunner quickly announces a revised estimate of range and lead (as appropriate) and fires. Both gunners continue exchanging range and lead information until one gets a hit. Once the range and lead are determined, gunners fire at the tar- get until it is destroyed. Pair firing is preferred over sequence firing, as it lets the gunners get hits fasten the gunner firing the second round can be ready to fire as soon as the first round impacts. In sequence firing, you must get another LAW, establish a sight picture, and fire. Pair firing also has the advantage of having two gunners track the target at one time. Volley firing. In volley firing, you and one or more other gunners fire at once. Before firing, each gunner prepares one or more LAWs Gun- ners fire on command or on signal until the target is destroyed for example, TANK, 100 METERS, SLOW TARGET, VOLLEY FIRE, READY, AIM, FIRE. Volley fire is used only when the range to the target and the lead have been determined. Range can be determined by map, by pacing, or by the results of pair firing after a target has been hit. The volley method is best because more rounds are fired at a target at one time. That increases the chance of a hit. M202A1, MULTISHOT ROCKET LAUNCHER 66-MM (FLASH) This is a lightweight, four-tube, 66-mm rocket launcher (RL). Aim and fire it from the right shoulder in the standing, kneeling, or prone position. It can fire a single rocket or up to four rockets semiautomatically at a rate of one rocket per second. It is reloaded with a new clip of four rockets. The brilliant splash of the bursting incendiary warhead makes it a good weapon to suppress enemy rocket gunners. When it impacts near enemy vehicles, it will make them button up. The most stable position for firing the FLASH is the standing supported position. When you fire it from a fighting posi- tion, there are two limitations. First, overhead cover can limit the elevation of the RL and therefore the range. Second, when elevating the RL, you must make sure that the rear of the launcher is outside the hole so that its backblast is not deflected on you.

You can use it in both antitank and antipersonnel roles. You can fire it from the ground, using the bipod or the monopod, or from the shoulder. The most stable firing position is the prone position. CHARACTERISTICS OF FIRE TRAJECTORY This is the path of a projectile from a weapon to the point of impact. At ranges out to 300 meters, the trajectory of rifle fire is almost flat. For greater ranges, G-11"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 you must raise the rifle muzzle, thus raising the height of the trajectory. The GL has a high trajectory that is differ- ent from that of a rifle. The GL muzzle velocity is slow when compared to that of a rifle, but it is fast enough to have a flat trajectory out to 150 meters. For targets at greater ranges (150 to 350 meters), you must hold the GL about 20 degrees above the horizontal. This results in a higher trajectory and increases the time of flight of the grenade to its target. Because the trajectory is high and the time of flight long at ranges beyond 150 meters, winds may blow the grenade off course. As a grenadier, you must compensate for this. DANGER SPACE This is the space between a weapon and its target where the trajectory does not rise above the average height of a standing man (1.8 meters). It includes the beaten zone. DEAD SPACE Any area within a weapon’s sector that cannot be hit by fire from that weapon is dead space. G-12"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 CONE OF FIRE This is the cone-shaped pattern formed by the paths of rounds in a group or burst. The paths of the rounds differ and form a cone because of gun vibration, wind changes, and variations in ammunition. BEATEN ZONE The area on the ground where the rounds in a cone of fire fall is the beaten zone.

CLASSES OF FIRE Fire is classified with respect to the ground and the target. Fire with respect to the ground is: Grazing fire when most of the rounds do not rise above 1 meter from the ground. Plunging fire when the path of the rounds is higher than a standing man except in its beaten zone. Plunging fire is attained when firing at long ranges, when firing from high ground to low ground, and when firing into a hillside. G-14"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 Fire with respect to the target is: Frontal fire when the rounds are fired directly at the front of the target.

Enfilade fire when the long axis of the beaten zone is the same as the long axis of the target. It can be either frontal, flanking, or oblique. It is the best type of fire with respect to the target because it makes the best use of the beaten zone. G-16"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 SUPPRESSIVE FIRE Fire directed at the enemy to keep him from seeing, tracking, or firing at the target is suppressive fire. It can be direct or indirect fire. Smoke placed on the enemy to keep him from seeing targets is also suppressive fire. FIRE DISTRIBUTION When firing at an enemy position, your leader will distribute his unit’s fire to cover the position. There are two ways to distribute fire on a target — point fire and area fire. METHODS OF DISTRIBUTION Point Fire. This is fire directed at one point; for example, an entire team firing at one bunker. G-17"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 Area Fire. This is fire directed to cover an area both laterally and in depth. If your leader wants fire on a woodline, he may first fire tracers to mark its center. Then, he may have the men on his left fire to the left of the tracers and those on his right fire to the right of the tracers. This is the best and quickest way to hit all parts of an area target. In area fire, you will fire at likely enemy positions rather than a general area. Fire first at that part of the target relative to your posi- tion in the team. Then distribute your fire over an area a few meters to the right and left of your first shot. COVERING THE TARGET AREA AUTOMATIC RIFLEMAN The part of the target which you, as an automatic rifleman, can hit depends on your position and the range to the target. When possi- ble, you cover the entire target. When firing automatic fire, you tend to fire high; so fire low at first and then work up to the target. G-18"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 MACHINE GUNNER As a machine gunner, fire into the part of the target assigned to you by your leader. DRAGON GUNNER As a Dragon gunner, fire into the part of the target assigned to you by your leader. Fire only at targets such as armored vehicles and key weapons. If there are no Dragon targets, fire your rifle. GRENADIER As a grenadier, fire your first grenade into the center of the target. Then distribute your shots over the remaining target area. FIRE CONTROL WAYS TO COMMUNICATE FIRE CONTROL Your leader will control your fire. The noise and confusion of battle will limit the use of some methods of control, so he will use the way or combination of ways that does the job. Sound. This includes both voice and devices such as whistles and horns. Sound signals are good only for short distances. Their range and reliability y are reduced by battle noise, weather, terrain, and vegetation. Voice communications may come directly from your leader to you or they may be passed from soldier to soldier. Prearranged fire. In prearranged fire, your leader tells you to start firing once the enemy reaches a certain point or terrain feature. When using prearranged fire, you do not have to wait for an order to start firing. Prearranged signals. In this method, your leader gives a prearranged signal when he wants you to start firing. This can be either a visual signal or a sound signal. Start firing immediately when you get the signal. Soldier-initiated fire. This is used when there is no time to wait for orders from your leader. Standing operating procedures (SOP). These can reduce the number of oral orders needed to control fire. SOPs must be known and under- stood by all members of the unit. Three SOPs are the search-fire-check SOP, the return-fire SOP, and the rate-of-fire SOP. A procedure for giving fire commands for direct fire weapons should also be SOP. The search-fire-check SOP, follows these steps: Step 1 Search your assigned sectors for enemy targets. Step 2 Fire at any targets (appropriate for your weapon) seen in your sectors. Step 3 While firing in your sectors, visually check with – your leader for specific orders. The return-fire SOP tells each soldier in a unit what to do in case the unit makes un- expected contact with the enemy (in an ambush, for example). These instructions will vary from unit to unit and from position to position within those units. The rate-of-fire SOP tells each soldier how fast to fire at the enemy. The rate of fire varies among weapons, but the principle is to fire at a maximum rate when first engaging a target and then slow the rate to a point that will keep the target suppressed. That helps keep weapons from running out of ammunition too fast. FIRE COMMANDS To help identify a target for a direct fire weapon and to control that weapon’s fire, a leader may give a fire command to that weapon. G-19"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 A fire command has the following six parts: Alert. Direction. Target Description. Range. Method of Fire. Command to Fire. Alert. This gets your attention. The leader may alert you by calling your name or unit designa- tion, by giving some type of visual or sound signal, by personal contact, or by any other practical way. Direction. This tells you which way to look to see the target. The following are ways to give the direction to the target: Your leader may point to a target with his arm or rifle. This will give you the general direction of the target. Your leader may fire tracer ammunition at a target to quickly and accurately identify it. However, before firing, he should show you the general direction. Your leader may designate certain fea- tures as TRPs before contact is made with the enemy. Each TRP will have a number to identify it. He may give a target’s direction in relationship to a TRP. For example FROM TRP 13, RIGHT 50. That means that the target is 50 meters to the right of TRP 13. Target Description. This tells you what the target is. Your leader should describe it briefly, but accurately. For example MACHINE GUN POSITION IN THE WOODLINE. Range. This tells you how far away the target is. The range is given in meters. G-20 Method of Fire. This tells you who is to fire. It may also tell you how much ammunition to fire. For example, your leader may want only the grenadier to fire at a target. He may also want him to fire only three rounds. For ex- ample, he would say: GRENADIER, THREE ROUNDS. Command to Fire. This tells you when to fire. It may be an oral command, or a sound or visual signal. If your leader wants to control the exact moment of fire, he may say AT MY COMMAND, (then pause until he is ready) FIRE. If he wants your fire to start upon com- pletion of the fire command, he will simply say FIRE (without pausing). Visual signals are the most common means of giving fire commands. Arm-and-hand signals, personal examples, and pyrotechnics are some of the things your leader may use for visual signals. Your leader may use arm-and-hand signals to give fire commands when you can see him. He may use flares and smoke grenades to mark targets in most conditions of visibility. Your leader may use his weapon to fire on a target as a signal; you fire when he fires. Watch your leader and do as he does. He may use tracers to point out targets."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 APPENDIX H Held Expedient Antiarmor Devices GENERAL There are many weapons that you can use to destroy a tank or an armored personnel carrier.

Fire into your secondary sector of fire only if there are no targets in your pri- mary sector, or if ordered to fire there. Your gun’s primary sector includes an FPL, a PDF, or a TRP. FINAL PROTECTIVE LINE Where terrain allows, your leader assigns an FPL to your weapon. The FPL is a line on which you shoot grazing fire across your unit’s front. The FPL will be assigned to you only if your leader determines there is a good distance of grazing fire. If there is, the FPL will then dictate the location of the primary sector. The FPL will become the primary sector limit (right or left) closest to friendly troops. When not firing at other targets, you will lay your gun on the FPL or PDF. DEAD SPACE Dead space is an area that direct fire weapons cannot hit. The area behind houses and hills or within orchards, for example, is dead space. PRINCIPAL DIRECTION OF FIRE When the terrain does not lend itself to an FPL, your leader will assign a PDF instead. The direction should be toward a gully or down a ditch that leads into your position. The gun is positioned to fire directly down this approach rather than across the platoon’s front. TARGETS Your leader may also designate locations within your sector of fire where targets are most likely to appear. These locations should be noted on your range card. I-2 TARGET REFERENCE POINTS Target reference points are natural or manmade features within your sector that can be used for quick location of targets. Target reference points are used primarily for con- trolling DIRECT FIRE weapons only; however, TRP should appear on the company target list. MAXIMUM ENGAGEMENT LINE The maximum engagement line is a line beyond which you cannot engage a target. This line may be closer than the maximum engage- ment range of your weapon. Both the terrain and the maximum engagement range of your weapon will determine the path of the maximum engagement line. This line is used for antiarmor range cards."},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 PREPARATION OF AN M60 MACHINE GUN RANGE CARD Range cards are prepared immediately upon arrival in your position. To prepare an M60 machine gun range card: Orient the card so that both the pri- mary and secondary sectors of fire (if assigned) can fit on it. Draw a rough sketch of the terrain to the front of your position. Include any prominent natural and manmade fea- tures which could be likely targets. Draw your position at the bottom of the sketch. Do not put in the weapon symbol at this time. Fill in the marginal data to include: Gun number (or squad). Unit (only platoon and company). Date. Magnetic north arrow.

Determine the location of your gun position in relation to a prominent ter- rain feature, such as a hilltop, road junction or building. If no feature exists, place the eight-digit map co- ordinates of your position near the point where you determined your gun position to be. If there is a prominent terrain feature within 1,000 meters of the gun, use that feature. Do not sketch in the gun symbol at this time. Using your compass, determine the azimuth in mils from the terrain fea- ture to the gun position. (Compute the back azimuth from the gun to the feature by adding or subtracting 3,200 mils.) Determine the distance between the gun and the feature by pacing or from a map. Sketch in the terrain feature on the card in the lower left or right hand cor- ner (whichever is closest to its actual direction on the ground) and identify it. Connect the sketch of the position and the terrain feature with a barbed line from the feature to the gun. Write in the distance in meters (above the barbed line). Write in the azimuth in mils from the feature to the gun (below the barbed line).

Lay the gun for direction. When assigned an FPL, lock the tra- versing slide on the extreme left or right of the bar, depending on which side of your primary sector the FPL is on. Align the barrel on the FPL by moving the tripod legs. (Do not enter a direc- tion in the data section for the FPL.) When assigned a PDF, align your gun on the primary sector by traversing the slide to one side and then move the tripod to align the barrel on your sector limit. Align on the PDF by traversing the slide until your gun is aimed at the center of the target. Fix the tripod legs in place by digging in or sandbagging them. The tripod, once emplaced for fire into the pri- mary sector, should not be moved. I-8"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 To read the direction to each target: Lay your gun on the center of the target. Read the direction directly off the traversing bar at the left edge of the traversing bar slide. Enter the reading under the direction column of your range card data section. A reading of left or right is determined by the direction of your barrel (just the opposite of the slide). To read elevation for your targets: Lay your gun on the base of the target by rotating the elevating handwheel. Read the number (to include a plus or minus sign, except for “0” ) above the first visible line on the elevating scale. The sketch reads –50. Read the number on the elevating handwheel that is in line with the in- dicator. The sketch reads 3. Enter this reading under the ELEVA- TION column of your range card data section, separating the two numbers with a slash (/). Always enter the read- ing from the upper elevating bar first. (The sketch reads –50/3.) Enter range to each target under the appropriate column in the data section. Enter the description of each target under the appropriate column in the data section. REMARKS COLUMN Fill in the remarks column for each target as needed: Enter the width and depth (in mils) of linear targets. The —4 in the illustra- tion indicates that by depressing your barrel 4 mils the strike of your rounds will go down to ground level along the FPL. When entering the width of the target, be sure to give the width in mils and express it as two values. For instance, the illustration shows that target number 3 has a width of 15 mils. The second value, L7, means that once the gun is laid on your target, traversing 7 mile to the LEFT will lay the gun on the left edge of the target. Enter aiming stake if one is used for the target. No data for the secondary sector will be determined since your gun will be fired in the bipod role. I-9"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"FM 21-75 RANGE CARD FOR THE CALIBER .50 The only differences between an M60 and a caliber .50 range card are as follows: The machine gun symbol is different. There are 800 mils of traverse with the caliber .50 compared to 875 mils with the M60. Maximum grazing fire with the caliber .50 is 1,000 meters compared to 600 meters with the M60. The caliber .50 machine gun has a secondary sector of fire; but it must be marked by aiming stakes since the caliber .50 machine gun has no bipod. ANTIARMOR RANGE CARD The purpose of an antiarmor range card is to show a sketch of the terrain that a weapon has been assigned to cover by fire. Range cards for 90-mm RCLR, 106-mm RCLR, Dragon, and TOW are all prepared the same. By using a range card, you can quickly and accurately determine the information needed to engage targets in your assigned sector. Before you prepare a range card, your leader will show you where to position your weapon so you can best cover your assigned sector of fire. He will then, again, point out the terrain you are to cover. He will do this by assigning you a sector of fire or by assigning left or right limits indicated by either terrain features or azimuths. If necessary, he may also assign you more than one sector of fire and will designate the sectors as primary and secondary.
