[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"A Common Sense Guide to Being Prepared Time Magazine, 8 October 2001 The shock of the September 11 airp lane attacks has made the impr obable and the catastrophic suddenly seem possible. Crop dusters have been grounded for f ears of a biological attac k. Guards are posted at many city reservoirs. Trucks are being inspected on their way into New York. But some scenarios are more likely than others. That's why we've assemble d this guide to help you sort out the threats for yourself and see what precautions people are taking. The possibility of any of these things happening is extremely remote. Even assembling the needed biological or chemical agents would require far more organization, money and expertise than was evident on September 11. But, in the interest of be ing prepared for the unlikely and also calming down any unnecessary fears, here's what 's being done, and what you can do. From TIME Magazine, October 8, 2001 By David Bjerklie, Christine Gorman and Alice Park In the three weeks since the Sept. 11 attacks, Amer icans have become increasingly concerned that the next one might be even worse. In the Time/cnn poll taken last week, 53% of those surveyed feared a chemical or biological attack; 23% a nuclear stri ke. Among terrorism experts, however, the focus has shifted from a single large-scale assa ult - which would be di fficult to pull off - to a series of smaller attacks that could be just as damaging to the U. S. economy and public mora le. How serious are these threats? What form might they take? The best guesses of the experts consulted by Time offer both reassurance and fresh cause for alarm. Here's a look at what form a possi ble future attack could take... DISEASE Smallpox It doesn't take an exotic virus like Ebola to transf orm the U.S. into a hot zone. A single case of smallpox could put the entire nation at risk. The smallpox vi rus is highly contagious and would spread quickly because Americans are not vaccinated. Routine i noculations were halted in 1972. People vaccinated before 1972 lost most of thei r immunity within 10 years. A terrorist who wanted to launch a smallpox attack, however, would probably have a very hard time getting hold of the virus. Smallpox was eradicated in 1980. Officially, only two stores of the virus exist, for research purposes, in secure locations in the U.S. and Russia. There may be covert stashes in Iraq, N orth Korea and Russia, but these countries would be reluctant to release them, fearing a smallpox epidemic among their own unvaccinated people. Even if a terrorist were suc cessful in obtaining the virus, his plans could backfire: smallpox is so cont agious that the first victims are likely to be the members of his own terrorist cell. Anthrax Many bacterial agents can be used as bioweapons , including Clostridium botulinum (botulism) and Yersinia pestis (plague). But anthrax stands out b ecause its spores are particularly hardy; they are resistant to sunlight, heat and disi nfectant, and can remain active in soil and water for years. Anthrax occurs naturally in both wild a nd domestic animals‹including cattle, sh eep and camels. Infection from direct contact with affected animal s is fatal in 20% of cases. If i nhaled, however, anthrax spores cause death in almost 90% of the time. Pa g e 1 of 4 David H.

The Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo sprayed anthrax and botulism eight times over part s of Tokyo without effect. Despite all the attention being given crop dusters, us ing one to spread germs is not as easy as it sounds. The planes are designed to spray pesticides in heavy, concentrated streams, whereas bioweapons are ideally scattered in a fine mist over as large an ar ea as possible. The nozzles in crop dusters are best suited to discharging relatively larg e particles - 100 microns in diameter - not tiny one-micron specks of bacteria. Sarin Unlike biological agents, which are living organisms th at require proper conditions to survive, chemical weapons such as the nerve gases sarin and VX are relatively easy to acquire and stockpile. Chemicals are difficult to manufacture in sufficient quantitie s for a large-scale attack, however; more likely are isolated assaults such as the 1995 sarin attack on a Tokyo subway that injured thousands and killed 12. WATER By David Bjerklie, Christine Gorman and Alice Park Reservoirs Poisoning your enemy's well is an ancient tradition, but would-be terrorists woul d find it extremely hard to inflict widespread casualties through our water supply. Chlorine in treated water kills most microbes, and huge quantities of chemical toxi ns would have to be dumped into a reservoir to make many people sick, let alone kill them. (A U.N. study estimated that it would take 10 tons of potassium cyanide.) Drinking water might be threatened locally, however, if someone managed to ta p the pipe going into a building or neighborhood or infiltrate a water-treatment facility. With this threat in mind, municipal water authorities have stepped up security. Dams If poisoning the water supply doesn't wo rk, terrorists might try to cut it off or disrupt it. On an even grander scale, they might blow up a dam, causing widespread flooding damage downstream. Compounding the impact woul d be the loss of hydroelectric-power generation. With security beefed up at major dams across the country, however, especi ally at landmark behemoths such as Hoover and Grand Coulee dams, it would take a very determ ined effort to carry out such an attack. HAZ-MATS By David Bjerklie, Christine Gorman and Alice Park Chemical plants some 850,000 facilities in the U.S. handle hazardous chemicals. Many substa nces that have benign industrial uses, such as metal cleaning or photo deve loping, can in theory be turned into dangerous weapons. But gaining access to plants, either for sabotage or to get raw materials, is difficult. Employees handling hazardous materials undergo security ba ckground checks, and chemical manufacturers across the country last week were double-checking their em ployee rolls. Since Sept. 11, most facilities have barred outside visitors and allowed only authorized personnel to enter. Trucking companies dan g erous chemicals are most vulnerable to interce p tion while the y are bein g trans p orted. Toda y 2.5 Pa g e 2 of 4 David H.

Truckers must pass two tests: the federally mandated 30-question mult iple-choice test (states can add more questions) to obtain a commerci al vehicle license and a separate test on the procedures for safely handling hazardous substances. After the arrest of about 20 people suspected of fraudulently obtaining haz-mat licenses, chemical companies tightened their transport policies, assigning two drivers to every vehicle and using satellite tracking systems to monitor haulers from pickup to drop-off. FOOD POISONING By David Bjerklie, Christine Gorman and Alice Park Salmonella as oregon's rajneeshee cult demonstrated in 1984, it is not difficult to set off a wave of food poisonings. Indeed, gastroenteritis caused by na tural contamination and careless f ood handling afflicts millions and results in 5,000 deaths each year. The Rajneeshees considered a number of different viruses and bacteria, including those that caus e hepatitis and typhus, but decided for their purposes (disrupting the outcome of a local election) on a stra in of salmonella that would be de bilitating but not fatal. Salmonella p oisonings tend to be localized. With proper hygiene, the bacterium is not part icularly contagious. E. coli an even easier bug to obtain is the familiar intestinal parasite E. coli. Naturally occurring outbreaks of E. coli, typically the result of fecal contamination in everythi ng from hamburgers to swimming pools, sicken hundreds of thousands of Amer icans each year. In New York City this spring, a man was arrested after he was spotted spraying what turned out to be feces-laden water over th e contents of a midtown salad bar (fortunately, no one got sick). A far more virulent strain of the bacterium called O157:H7 is sometimes fatal, but identifying and isolating the right strain is beyond the techni cal capabilities of most terrorists. Foot-and-mouth disease a terrorist attack aimed at crops and livestock would be less dramatic but might cause more disruption in the long run. Such attempts are not unheard of. In World War II, Br itain accused Germany of dropping small, cardboard bombs filled wi th beetle pests on English potato fields, and in the 1980s Tamil militants threatened to target Sri Lankan tea and r ubber plantations with plant pathogens. Perhaps the most worrisome threat to U.S. agriculture is foot-a nd-mouth disease, which can spread with astonishing speed in sheep, cattle and swine. Not seen in this country since 1929, the disease is harmless to humans but renders farm animals economically worthless. The U.S. could be forced to destroy much of its own livestock, as Great Britain ha d to do earlier this year. EXPLOSIVES By David Bjerklie, Christine Gorman and Alice Park Car, truck and backpack bombs exotic weapons get a lot of attentio n, but conventional explosives and suicide bombers in pizza parlors, discothèques and shopping malls can sp read terror with stunning effectiven ess. Fertilizer bombs like the one that destroyed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Okla., in 1995 could wreak havoc with bridges, tunnels and buildings. Nuclea r-power and chemical-manufacturing plants make even more horrifying targets. The 1984 leak at the Union Carbide plant in Bhopal, India, may have killed 3,000. Estimates of the final de ath toll from the 1986 explosion in the Chernobyl nuclear plant run as hi g h as 30,000. Pa g e 3 of 4 David H.

For this reason, the ability to create - or worse, st eal or buy - weapons-grade plutonium has long been an issue of great concern and international in trigue. Fortunately, the practical diffic ulties in acquiring precisely the right materials, not to mention the engi neering know-how to je rry-build a nuclear devi ce successfully, makes this type of threat highly unlikely. BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS E xcerpted from \"The Next Threat \", Time Magazine, 1 October 2001 Germ warfare has been around since at least the Mi ddle Ages, when armies besieging a city would catapult corpses infected with the black plague over the walls. Today the bugs authorities most fear are anthrax (a bacterium) and smallpox (a virus). Both ar e highly lethal: the former kills nearly 90% of its victims, the latter some 30%. Anthrax is not communicable; smallpox, on the other hand, can be transmitted with horrifying ease from one person to a nother. \"The feelings of uncertainty, of who is infected, of who will get infected, are the main adva ntages of biowarfare,\" sa ys Stephen Morse of the Columbia University School of Public Health. During the cold war, both the U.S. and the Soviet Union began developing anthrax as a biological weapon. Today 17 nations are believed to have bi ological weapons programs, many of which involve anthrax. Officially, the only sources of smallpox ar e small quantities in the labs of the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta and at Vector in Kolts ovo, Russia. But experts believe that Russia, Iraq and N orth Korea have all experimented wi th the virus and that significant secret stashes remain. Even more worrisome are reports that Russia us ed genetic engineering to try to make anthrax and smallpox more lethal and resistant to antibiotics and vaccine s. (The U.S. put a similar program on hold.) Why not just vaccinate every Amer ican against every possible germ-warfare agent? That would be impractical, if not impossible, and the side effects of the inoculati ons would pose a significant health risk. Instead, says Michael Osterholm, director of th e Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, we should strengthen the country's public health system. After Sept. 11, hospitals in New York City were asked to report any outbreaks of unusual symptoms. Health experts know that in the event of biological attack, the earlier an epidemic is detected, the easier it is to contain. Experts in antiterrorism share their concern. At the tu rn of the past century, says Brian Jenkins of the Rand Corp., epidemics of diseases like yellow fever and cholera kept health workers on their toes. Now, after a decade of cutbacks, \"our abil ity to treat large numbers of casua lties has been reduced,\" he says. \"The notion of reinvesting to create a muscular public health system is not a bad idea, even if there is no terrorism.\" General Safeguards z All cropdusters have b een temporarily grounded. z The CDC maintains and can expand a national pharmaceutical stockpile with antibiotics, vaccines and antidotes for many biological attacks. z You can stock up on a few emergency items, incl uding bottled water, storable food, batteries, flashli g ht, antibiotics, a p ortable radio and face mask.
