W ork? School? Home? Traveling? W ill you know What to do and where to go? 4 STEPS T O SAFETY 1. Finding Out What Could Happen in Your Area. A. Contact the organizations that are listed at the front of this booklet. They can give you the phone numbers to your local chapter who can tell you what disasters could happen in your area. B. Find out what your community’s warning signals are, what they sound like and what you should do when you hear them. C. Learn about the disaster plans at work, school, daycare and other places where your family spends time. D. If you have animals, find out about animal care. They may not be allowed in some places during and after a disaster. E. Find out how to help the elderly and disabled. 2. Create a Disaster Plan for your family. A. Meet with your family and discuss what types of disasters could happen in your area and what to do. (Page 25) B. Discuss the steps of evacuation. (Page 22) C. Choose 2 places to meet family members: 1. Outside your house if members are home. 2. Outside your neighborhood in case you can’t get to your home. (City park, church, school play ground, etc.) D. Ask an out-of-state family member or friend to be your family’s “Contact Person”. After a disaster, communications can be difficult. Many times it is easier to get through to your contact person out of state than to make a local call. If your family members become sepa- rated in a disaster, have them call this person and let them know where they are and if all is well with them. 3. Practice and Maintain your plan A. Conduct fire and emergency evacuation drills. B. Quiz your family every six months so they don’t forget. C. Test and recharge fire extinguishers. D. Check/rotate food & water in your evacuation-kit every 6 months. E. Test smoke detectors monthly. Change batteries every 6 months. F. Remember to always remain calm. Panic causes accidents. www.areyouprepared.com ©2001 Emergency Preparedness Center info@areyouprepared.com   page   7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Important Phone Numbers Post by each phone.

Don’t just buy wheat and powered milk and think “Life will be great!” Store the kind of foods you eat in all of these categories. If you have the money and like the convenience of already prepared foods, store Freeze Dried and MREs. If you are on a tight budget , buy a little extra each time you go to the grocery store, plant a garden, avoid fast food and save your money for some extras. How Much? This varies depending upon your age, size and needs. We offer a computerized print out of how much your family needs for 1-1000 months of storage with a listing of how many calories, fat, protein, etc., that the food will give you. This is customized to fit your family’s needs by taking into consideration the age of each member, then calculates a balanced diet. Email us at info@areyouprepared.com for more about this. Here is a sample of the very basics for survival for an average person. How to Store? Containers are very important. To extend the shelf life of the foods, choose the containers and how they are packaged wisely. Air, light, heat, moisture, pests, etc., will destroy your food if allowed in any container. www.areyouprepared.com ©2001 Emergency Preparedness Center info@areyouprepared.com   page   41 Foods . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

We recommend using the following for the different food groups to accomplish an optimal food storage program. Don’t store all in just one type of container. Y our choices 1. Paper and plastic bags: Not good for long term storage. Rotate these items within 6 months to a year. 2. 5 or 6 gal plastic food grade buckets: Great for storing wheat, grains, beans and sugar. If packaged properly, food will store a very long time. 3. No.10 double enameled cans: If packaged properly, food will store for a very long time. 4. Bottles: For canning and preserving fruits and vegetables. 5. Metal cans: Not recommended because of rusting. Rotation Rotation is very important. Food loses it nutritional value over time and when it is exposed to light and heat. Always keep it cool and in a dark room. If you had a 1 year supply of food and you ate from it once a week, you would rotate your entire 1 year supply in 7 years. WA TER W e’ve already discussed the importance of water and how to find, store and purify it. (See Chapter 1.3). It is recommended to storage 1 gal per person per day for 2 weeks. It becomes impossible to store enough water for 1 year for a person. Having a source of water and know- ing how to purify it, becomes very important. CLOTHES If times become difficult it may be nice to have on hand extra clothes to go through and wear if for some reason you can’t buy them. Every 6 months to a year go through your clothes and see what you really wear and what you don’t. Take the ones that you don’t wear and put away in time of need. As you rotate out of your closet also rotate out of your storage box keeping the best items. Also store a few pair of shoes. www.areyouprepared.com ©2001 Emergency Preparedness Center info@areyouprepared.com   page   42"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"FINANCES Have on hand $100 cash in small bills, credit cards, checkbook. Put all of your important documents in a safe, fire proof place. Have all of the necessary insurances in place to protect you against losses.

SHELTER If you are temporally displaced you may be able to go to a friends/relative or stay in a Motel. If not, here are some alternative temporary shelters you may consider. Tent, camper, travel trailer, motor home, community shelter, bomb shelter or any other out building that is safe.

Remember to have sufficient fuel on hand for these. SANITATION Keeping clean during disasters and emergencies is essential to maintain good health and is often difficult to accomplish. Think for a moment: what would you do with out running water? Here is a list of some sanitation supplies. Portable camping toilet, heavy-duty plastic bags, metal trash cans, paper towels, rubber gloves, scrubbing pads, detergent, rodent traps, disinfectants, shovel, liquid soap, shampoo, towelettes, wash cloths, disposable plates, cups, eating utensils, pocket knife, infant supplies, disposable diapers, toiletries just to name a few. www.areyouprepared.com ©2001 Emergency Preparedness Center info@areyouprepared.com   page   44"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6 OTHER IMPORTANT WEB SITES Important Web Sites that can be very helpful This one link has it all.
