However, like any skill, foraging is something that is developed and honed over time. You do not need to know everything, and we must all begin somewhere. Nobody starts as an expert—including myself. The most important factors are an appreciation for the natural world and a desire to learn. “The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you’ll go.” — D R. SEU SS"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"BASIC RU LES O F FO RAG IN G So what exactly is “foraging”? Foraging is simply the means of acquiring food from nature—it can include hunting animals; fishing; gathering plants and fungi; and scavenging on the efforts of other animals when the opportunity presents itself to you. Survivalists, herbalists, and nature enthusiasts can all agree on a few simple rules and guidelines that will help to keep not only yourself safe but also the environment in which you find yourself while out foraging. As foragers, it is our responsibility to use nature’s resources wisely and respectfully. 1 . Be aware of your surroundings: It is crucial to understand the type of environment and landscapes in which you may find yourself. How likely are you to run into a bear or dangerous animal? Is there access to freshwater? Are there venomous spiders to consider while outdoors? What is the chance of falling off a high cliff or into a raging"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"river? How hot or cold does it get? Are there things to look out for like deep crevices, sinkholes, or caves? 2 . Never go alone: If you do, always make sure that someone knows where you are and inform them of the intended length of your excursions. 3 . Wear personal protective equipment: Use gloves when harvesting prickly or spiny plants, and use a mask or face covering when working with fungi to avoid inhaling spores. 4 . Avoid uncertainty: It is always safer to stick to what you know—especially when you are in an actual survival situation where your life is at risk. Do not waste time and energy seeking out new types of foods if you have access to something that is familiar. 5 . Experiment only when you can afford to: Experimentation while out foraging is undoubtedly important and has its place but only at the right time and in the right places. Ensure that you can get access to medical attention as soon as possible if something goes"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"wrong. 6 . Memorize the locals: Having a short list of safe foods to forage for in your area can help save you time and energy. List some useful plants, fungi, and easy-to-find animal resources like insects or bird nests. 7 . Consult an expert: Foraging often involves using knowledge and information that is passed down through several generations and thoroughly tested to ensure its safety. Use this information to your advantage: Speak to the experts in your area or consult their books and videos before you begin a trek. 8 . Wash your food: Removing any dirt and grime from your forage will make them more palatable, easier to prepare, and less likely to make you sick. 9 . Cook the food: It is best to cook your foraged foods wherever possible. This is important for plants, fungi, and animals. Wild animals are rife with parasites such as tapeworms, intestinal flukes, and toxoplasmosis which can"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"cause havoc to your health if they are not killed before ingesting. Cooking is also important, as it makes most foods easier to digest, requiring less energy. 10 . Test new foods and ingest them in small quantities: When experimenting or faced with a situation where you have no choice, you may encounter new foods. It is critical to carry out an edibility test first. 11 . Forage sustainably: Only take what you need and avoid overharvesting. Harvest plants so that they stand a chance of recovering and reproducing and try to choose animals that are not in their breeding prime. Never collect endangered or rare species unless necessary for your survival: Even in the most severe circumstances, you may still face fines or prosecution under different laws. 12 . Know which parts of a plant you can eat: Different parts of different plants will have different qualities. Some plants may have nutritious leaves but poisonous berries, while others have"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"tasty roots below the surface but toxic stems above. Selecting the correct parts of the plant and appropriately preparing them can make even some of the most treacherous plants safe for consumption. 13 . Harvest based on the season: Certain parts of a plant will be the most nutritious during certain seasons. Spring is usually a sparse season with very little to eat. Fall is the time when many plants and animals prepare for the winter by storing nutrients, making them ripe for the picking. Leaves are generally most nutritious before the buds develop, flowers are most nutritious before any fruit or seeds begin to grow, and roots are most nutritious right before the winter. 14 . Plants can kill: Do not underestimate the toxicity of certain plants. Poison hemlock, pokeweed, nettle, blue flag iris, and buckthorn are just some of the plants you may encounter that could easily lead to death if ingested. (Several poisonous plants are used by"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Indigenous people for medicinal purposes but involve supervision by experienced traditional practitioners and should not be imitated.) 15 . Most insects are safe to eat: Insects are distinguished by having three pairs of legs, one pair of antennae, and three- segmented bodies. Termites, grasshoppers, crickets, beetles, caterpillars, and bugs are excellent protein sources while foraging. It is best to avoid other creepy crawlies such as arachnids, scorpions, millipedes, and centipedes which can be venomous or poisonous. 16 . Bright colors are a warning: Many animals, especially insects and even some plants, use bright, flashy colors to deter predators from eating them. It is usually a good indication that they contain poison or venom. The use of red, yellow, white, or black is most common. 17 . Do not shy away from slime: Mollusks, like slugs, snails, and worms may seem off-putting, but there is"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"usually nothing wrong with eating them if they are thoroughly cooked. (It is important to avoid bright coloration, though.) 18 . Small animals are better than no animals: The thought of hunting large prey is exciting but challenging. Small animals such as birds, snakes, amphibians, and even rodents make for more manageable prey. They just need to be prepared with care by removing the skin/feathers and cooking thoroughly. 19 . Do not eat sickly plants, animals, or fungi: Avoid eating plants or fungi that have discoloration, markings, or look wilted and unhealthy in any way. Similarly, do not eat sick animals or those that have died from disease or infection. 20 . Avoid contaminated areas: One of the major purposes of foraging is to get in touch with nature, and you should try to avoid human influences on the world, such as pollution. Do not harvest plants near power stations,"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"from polluted rivers, near dumping sites, or other contaminated areas. 21 . An ocean of abundance: Seas are a critical food source for coastal foragers, offering fish, sea vegetables, squid, octopus, and easy-to-collect animals like snails, starfish, and sea urchins. 22 . Vitamins and minerals are essential, too: Ensuring you can forage for enough calories is only half of the task. It is also important to get a wide range of vitamins and minerals to maintain all the functions in your body. The water- soluble vitamins such as C and the Bs will quickly deplete, whereas fat- soluble vitamins like A, D, E, and K will be stored for longer periods. 23 . Do not trespass: This rule is quite self- explanatory; nobody wants to end up in a jail cell—or worse, shot—by trespassing illegally on private land. Foraging is also banned in certain national parks and protected areas, and it is best to consult with the rules and regulations beforehand. 24 . Share your knowledge so that others"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"may enjoy foraging, too: A major component of survivalism is ensuring that as many people can survive as possible. Not only this but helping more people to appreciate and participate in nature will lead them to protect and serve the natural world— helping to ensure a better and more secure future for the environment. W H AT CAN YO U FO RAG E? In nature, there are certain types of foods that are more highly prized than others, primarily since they are more nutrient-dense or calorie- dense. Nutrient-dense foods have a large volume of nutrients per calorie, and calorie- dense foods offer more calories per weight. It is important to try and choose these kinds of foods whenever possible because you will need less of it to get a sufficient amount of nutrients and calories. Edible foods are rarely found in abundance in natural environments, and going hungry will be common. These foods will do little to fight hunger, but they"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"will stave off starvation. Another important aspect to note is that it is near impossible to survive on foraged plants alone for any extended amount of time. If you venture out into the wilderness, you will need to rely on animal foods to ensure you get enough calories and proteins. However, there are some esteemed plant foods that will definitely help: Tree Nuts Nuts are often produced in abundance by various trees during fall and can last long into the winter. They are dry fruits protected by a hard outer shell and are rich in proteins, fats, essential vitamins, and minerals. Most types take little to no preparation once you get the shells open, while others simply need to be boiled for a few minutes. Some of the best types of nuts to look out for are black walnuts, butternuts (white walnuts), hickory nuts, acorns, hazelnuts, chestnuts, beechnuts, pine nuts, and pecans. Seeds"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Seeds make another excellent source of food while out foraging. Several types of grasses and wildflowers produce edible seeds, supplying important minerals like calcium and iron along with satiating fats and protein. They will generally require some winnowing, milling, or grinding to break down the seed hull but can then be used to produce nourishing meal and porridges. Amaranth, curly dock, and lamb’s quarters are favorites among foragers due to their relatively good yields and low processing requirements. Roots and Tubers Many plants store nutrients and minerals in their roots, forming large, edible tubers. These are usually a good source of carbohydrates such as starch and are easy to collect and prepare. Cattails, arrowroot, chicory, burdock, wild carrots, kudzu, and wild yams produce sizable and tasty tubers. Dandelions, blue thistle, daylilies, amaranth, and agave grow smaller but still edible roots. Roots can also include rhizomes; these are not technically root structures but instead are"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"horizontal stems used by plants to spread and propagate. Rhizomes most commonly grow underground. Berries and Fruit Plants grow fruits so that they can be eaten! That is their entire purpose. They evolve to be as delicious, attractive, and tasty as possible so that foragers will keep coming back year after year. By eating the fruit, the seeds inside can be dispersed throughout the environment in the poop of various animals. Some kinds of seeds will never germinate unless they pass through a digestive tract. Berries such as raspberries, blackberries, blueberries, strawberries, and mulberries are among the most common types of fruit you are likely to encounter in the wild. Stone fruits, such as cherries, peaches, nectarines, mangoes, and avocados, are a little less common. They are an excellent source of vitamin C, K, E, and B vitamins.

But there is a world of difference between feeling hungry and true starvation, and a small incident can trigger a chain of events that may quickly lead you down the path of starvation in a survival situation. With a dwindling food supply and aching stomach, it is essential that you are able to sustain yourself in the wilderness. Being able to identify some of the most common wild edibles can save you—buying you enough time to make it back to civilization. These are among the most common edible plants that you may find in the wild. They occur naturally or have been introduced as useful species in North America and Europe; are easy to identify; and can serve as a useful food source for any beginner forager: 1.

Several of the most common edible species have been introduced throughout the world, primarily due to their beneficial medicinal and nutritional properties. You don’t really need to venture out into the woods to find several of these plants. Your gardens, parks, vacant lots, and sidewalks are an excellent place to begin foraging before you head out into the wilderness.

In regions without surface water, plants will try to access the groundwater. This is common in large, open spaces where you may find a few small outcrops of trees that have managed to dig down below the surface into aquifers. These outcrops will attract opportunistic species that may be edible. In humid climates, access to water will not be a problem, and edible plants are more likely to be found in open areas and clearings with lots of sunshine. In humid climates, rocky outcrops are also an excellent place to look. The rocks provide good drainage and prevent plants from getting waterlogged, making them an ideal habitat. The edges of a forest are a good place to look for plants because they gain protection from strong winds, allowing them to grow better."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"The bases of hardwood trees and their surrounding areas are the best place to find various kinds of edible mushrooms. In general, plants that grow in abundance are more likely to be edible. This is because their seeds are more likely to be dispersed by various animals that feed on them. Animals will tend to avoid toxic varieties, and it is more difficult for them to be dispersed. CO N CLU SIO N “Study nature, love nature, stay close to nature.

Foraging connects one with nature in a way that few other skills can. However, you do not need to find yourself in a survival situation to begin. Some of the best places to begin honing your skills are on your own land or in your local parks and green spaces. You will find several herbs, berries, roots, and other edible plant foods which have found their way into urban spaces. It is also a great way for you to begin learning how to collect, store, and preserve plants for future use. Keep an eye out near agricultural areas, livestock pastures, and fields where you may find plants such as sunflowers, plantain, thistle, or Jerusalem artichokes. Visit rivers and streams to investigate the aquatic plants—cattails, watercress, water pepper, wasabi, and lotus to name a few.

Several plants have close relatives with similar appearances but different chemical properties. While one may make a nutritious addition to a salad, the other could lead to seizures and paralysis. I can share my own experience of preventing my friend from consuming what he thought was a safe plant. While hiking and exploring in the woodlands, my friend spotted some enticing berries resembling wild grapes. They"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"were the right size, shape, and color: 1 cm (0.39 inches) in diameter, round, and blue- black.

Luckily, neither he nor I had eaten any of the berries yet. We would expect to experience stomach pain, dizziness, and nausea, followed by convulsions and possibly death. Unfortunately, far too many foragers have managed to poison themselves by consuming toxic lookalikes, and many have died because of it. By following the forager’s rules, you can avoid these risks.

We distinguish between flowering plants and cone-producing plants; between vascular plants and nonvascular plants; between trees, shrubs, bushes, and thickets; between the different shapes and margins of leaves; and between the types of roots growing below the ground. Similar plants will have similar patterns or characteristics because they are related. Generally, the more closely related two plants are, the more patterns they will have in common.

The comfort brought on by a fire is a primal instinct instilled in all of us. Knowing how to build a fire in many"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"different situations is one of the most important skills of a survivalist. Fire is used to disinfect water of pathogens and bacteria; to disinfect plant and animal foods; to cook foods and make them edible; and also keep you warm. Fire is also a great defense against wild animals and biting insects. PREPPIN G A FIREPLACE First, you will need a safe area in which to build the fire: It should be a good distance—15 to 30 feet—away from the rest of your campsite. Your fire should always be downwind of your campsite. The area should be clear of flammable debris like plant material, especially dry grass. This also includes treetops and branches above the fire. Choose an area with bare soil, sand, or gravel. Bank for your fire using a ring of rocks."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"(Rocks saturated with water can explode under high heat, so choose dry rocks.) Dig a shallow pit in the center to concentrate your coals and reduce smoke. G ATH ERIN G M ATERIALS Before you can build a fire, you need to gather and prepare all the necessary materials: Tinder: This is very fine, dry, and highly flammable material used to catch a spark and ignite a small flame. It can include dry leaves, bark, wood shavings, dry grass, moss, and even twine, cotton balls, newspaper shreds, or dryer lint. Kindling: This is a slightly larger flammable material used to fuel the small flames in the tinder. The best types of kindling are very small, thin branches and twigs which are dry"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"enough to snap. Kindling should be added to the fire in stages, from the smallest pieces to progressively larger ones, until the small fire is raging happily. Firewood: These are large pieces of wood that will burn slowly and fuel the fire for long periods. You can use branches, logs, and pine cones from any tree. Softwood trees like conifers will burn more quickly and at higher temperatures, whereas hardwood burns more slowly. The firewood does not have to be completely dry for the fire to burn properly, though drier woods are always preferred."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"FIRE D ESIG N Once you have collected all the materials, you can begin putting the fire together. There are a few different fire designs, each suited to different purposes, which we will discuss below: Teepee: This design is the most common way to build a fire. First, lay down a bed of tinder and then sit up your kindling in a teepee shape,"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"tapering to a point at the top. As the fire begins to burn more strongly, you can add larger pieces of firewood to the outside of the structure. The firewood should not be packed too tightly as to restrict airflow—especially when coals and embers begin to collect in the center. Teepee fires are good for warming you up quickly, as they burn through wood hot and fast. You need to place additional pieces of firewood up against the sides, making it an easy design to maintain."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Log cabin: This design is another simple arrangement beginning with a bed of tinder on which you can lay some pieces of kindling down flat, all in a similar direction. Once you have a flame going, begin laying down two to three pieces of firewood parallel to each other. Build another layer in the direction perpendicular to the base, and repeat this process until the fire is as big as you need it to be. You can also build the entire structure and then ignite it at the base to avoid burning yourself. There should be spaces in between each piece of firewood to allow for airflow. This type of design burns more slowly than a teepee and is good if you need the fire to last a long time."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Upside down: This design is similar to the log cabin except the purpose is to ignite it from tinder and kindling at the top rather than the base. This allows a bed of coals to form, on which pots or pans can be placed for cooking food. It is also a relatively slow-burning method but can build up a lot of heat due to the bed of coals in the center. Lean-to: This type of fire uses the wood as a windbreak and can be used to cook foods in windy conditions. Use a relatively large piece of firewood and lay it on its side. Set up a small bed of"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"tinder and kindling on the downwind side so that it is protected. Ignite the fire and lay smaller pieces of firewood on top so that their tips lean on the large piece. The smaller pieces of firewood should burn through and be replaced before the larger piece.

Set up a bed of tinder and"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"kindling in the center of a firepit and lay your pieces of firewood in a star shape with the tips pointing inward. Ignite the fire, and it will burn only the tips. You can maintain the fire by pushing the logs inward toward the center when needed. You can also salvage the rest of the unburned firewood using this method. Self-Feeding: This design is a bit more complex but is good if you are busy working on other tasks and need the fire to continue burning with minimal maintenance. You will need to build a large support frame in the shape of a V so that logs can be stacked onto the diagonal frames and roll down into the center as logs burn out. The frame must be large enough to avoid direct contact with the flames. FLAM E TO FIRE Starting a fire without matches or a lighter can be a frustrating or exciting challenge."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"There are several traditional methods you should try, but there are a few modern hacks that you can use to get your fires started: The Hand Drill: This method uses friction to create a tiny glowing ember which can be transferred to a bed of tinder.

Still, it is a good skill to have in your arsenal: You will need a long, straight, and smooth stick—the drill—and a flatter piece of wood to serve as the fireboard. The tip of the drill stick must be carved into a point, and a notch must be cut into the center of the fireboard for the drill tip to sit in. It is helpful to create a small bed of tinder right next to this notch. To create friction, you need to spin the stick in between your hands as you apply downward pressure. Keep repeating this until you see a"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"small amount of smoke. Then, you can begin looking for a tiny, glowing ember. Feed the ember with a small amount of tinder and allow the small fire to grow and develop. Then transfer it to a fireplace with some tinder, adding successively larger pieces.

Once the tinder is lit, transfer it to a fire pit where you can feed it with kindling and then pieces of firewood. The Bow Drill: This method also uses friction but instead of having to use your hands to spin the drill stick, it’s a bow with string or twine. It is a much more efficient method if you have some kind of string, twine, or shoelace available: The bow should be about as long as"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"your arm to improve efficiency. The string of the bow must be looped around the drill stick so that when you move it back and forth, the drill stick will spin.

Draw the bow back and forth while applying downward pressure to the drill stick. Wait until you see a small amount of smoke and look out for a glowing ember.

Just like our ancestors did, sharp blades can be produced using rocks. Find the ideal rocks in outcrops, streams, or creeks. The best types of rocks for this purpose are flint, chert, jasper, chalcedony, quartz, and obsidian, but you will need to test a few different types out to see what works best.

Due to the physics of water, it will never get hotter than 212 °F , and most animal tissues will be able to hold up well enough. Hot rocks may burn through these materials. A large leaf can be used to contain water when using the hot rock method or by suspending it over a fire. Hole in the ground: You can also dig out a hole in the ground, though this works better in soils with a high clay content. You can line the hole with rocks, clay, and grass to create a watertight surface, and use the hot rock method to bring the water to a boil. You may need to bake the surface using hot coals before adding water."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Trash: It is difficult to escape man’s impact on the world, and even in the most remote locations, it is likely that you will stumble upon trash such as plastic bottles, drink cans, and plastic bags. All of these can be used to boil water and cook foods. A plastic bag filled with water can safely be suspended above a fire without burning. Water boils at 212 °F and does not get hotter, whereas the plastic burns at higher temperatures. Plastic materials may warp, but this is not a problem as long as it contains your water. However, hot rocks may burn through these materials. Weapons Weapons are necessary tools for defense when you are out in the wild, but you will primarily use them to catch food. Some of the oldest weapons employed by humans include spears, atlatls, rock slings, and the bow and arrow."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Spears: Making a spear is simple enough, though you can take them to the next level. Spears must be made from long, sturdy, and straight pieces of wood. You can sharpen the tips using a knife and then harden it in a fire until the end turns black. You can also add sharp stone blades to the tip by carving away some wood to create a “shelf” on which the blade can sit. Secure the blade using lashings made from string, twine, plastic, leather, or animal intestines."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Atlatl: Also known as a spear-thrower, this tool can help increase the accuracy, range, and power of your spear throws, making them better suited to larger prey. They are made from thicker and heavier branches than you would use for spears—up to almost three inches in diameter but only about one-third the length. They have a spur on one end that connects to the butt of the spear. The spears may need to be altered to fit into the throwers. Rock slings: This is a very powerful and (with practice) deadly accurate weapon suited to small game like rabbits and birds but also good for fending off predators—think David and Goliath. A rock sling is made with any kind of cord, including leather, paracord, or rope. It needs to be about two to four feet long, depending on the reach of your arms.

Archery lessons are necessary if you want to go bow hunting."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"M AKIN G A STO VE Cooking in the wild is a little different from cooking in a kitchen with stoves, ovens, and microwaves, but it can be even more rewarding and delicious. Grill and griddle If you find yourself without a surface to cook on, you can always use temporary grills like a piece of chain-link fence or even chicken wire. Keep in mind that many of these metals are galvanized and will release zinc into your foods and the air when heated—this is not good for your health and should only be done if you have no alternatives. Alternatively, you can use thin and flat pieces of rock, like slate, or ceramic tiles as a griddle or skillet. (You can also use sheets of metal, but the same risks of galvanized metal apply.) The best way to do this is to set up a support frame above the ground and place your grill or griddle on top. Start a fire next to this structure, wait for some coal to form, and brush the coals underneath the grill."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Spit A spit is a traditional way of cooking many types of animals.

Light a fire at the bottom of the pit and let it burn out to coals. Then, cover the hot coals with some rocks; a layer of grass or vegetation for moisture; then your food. Next, you need to cover the food with more vegetation, rocks, and dirt to seal it in the hole. Depending on the type and size of your food, it can take up to 12 hours to cook, so this method is best saved for larger prey items. Stone oven A stone oven is a simple way to use rocks for retaining heat. You will need to create an elevated platform; back and sidewalls; and a roof out of rocks. Try to choose flatter rocks that will have fewer holes when stacked upon each other. You can also make a round oven, but make sure to leave an opening for your food to fit through. You can start a fire at the base and then place your food upon the platform just above the fire. The rocks will help to retain a higher temperature inside the oven."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"SO LAR CO O KIN G For those times when you cannot build a fire or set up a grill for cooking food, you can always use the sun. Dehydrating: Many kinds of foods, including fruit and meat, can be dehydrated, using the sun or heat, and safely consumed. Jerky is a great example. Dehydrating works best in very hot regions where you may not be able to find enough firewood, like out in the desert. You just need to slice and lay out your foods in the sun for them to dry. This can take a long time depending on the type of food, and you will need to watch out that other animals do not steal it. You can also dry out foods next to a fire. This works well for fruits that you may not want to cook but still need to preserve."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Solar oven: You can use the sun’s rays to cook foods using some carefully placed reflectors. Solar ovens are sold in camping and survivalist stores but can also be made at home. You simply need to create a box or grill (cardboard, plastic, or metal can work) with a mirror or similarly reflective surfaces like aluminum foil or shiny metals. The reflectors can be attached to one side or on all four sides like flaps. You can also buy solar ovens shaped like satellite dishes.

While you are out in the wilderness, you must use your time wisely. Many of these cooking methods require a lot of grunt work—you need to collect firewood, tinder, and kindling; find a suitable location; transport your food and water; dig holes; carve sticks; stack rocks; etc. You need to do all of these tasks before you can even begin cooking. It is best to do this before you begin fatiguing from hunger. If you are prepared today, you are investing in your survival tomorrow. You may not have access to firewood and be forced to rely on the heat of the sun. You may find yourself in a very damp environment"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"where your tinder refuses to ignite. You may struggle to find palatable prey—forced to eat frogs and insects. You cannot let any of these obstacles stand in the way of your survival. It is also important to remain aware of your surroundings and be careful when cooking food in a survival situation. The odors of cooking food can attract predators of all sizes, from the small and opportunistic scavengers that steal from right beneath your nose to the larger ones that could easily make a meal of you! There is also no burn unit out in the wild. Never take chances playing with fire and hot objects. Always use long sticks to push coals around; never handle hot food with your bare hands; triple-check that your fires and pokers are completely extinguished when you are finished; and, if possible, have a supply of water nearby for emergencies. W ATER In my previous book, Practical Survival"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Skills: First Aid & Natural Medicines You Need to Know to Keep You Healthy & Fit In a Survival Situation , I discuss finding water out in the wild to cure dehydration. I need to reiterate the importance of never drinking water straight from the source—no matter how thirsty you may be. Untreated water will kill you much faster than dehydration. It may be filled with chemical contaminants, parasites, pathogens, and dangerous waste products. You need to know how to make water safe for drinking, but you also need to know where to find it. Drinking “water alternatives” is never a good idea, and even in desperate situations, you should avoid drinking urine, blood, alcohol, or seawater (including sea ice). These are not realistic alternatives—they will exacerbate the dehydration, poison your body with toxic substances that it has already worked to remove, and can lead to the transmission of viruses and diseases. Where to Find Water Desert habitats:"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"One of the best tips for finding water in the desert is to watch other animals. Birds and most mammals will lead you to water if you can follow them. Look out for tracks and other signs. Collect dew and condensation: Metal objects work especially well, but if you have a tent, use it, too. Set up your objects at night and collect dew before dawn. Use a piece of fabric to wipe the moisture up. Look for groundwater: Look for any patches of vegetation and dig a well. It is best to do this at the lowest elevations possible, so don’t waste your time digging at the top of a dune. Several deserts have massive rivers flowing below the surface. Rock crevices: Check deep within these areas for even the slightest bit of moisture and use a piece of fabric to wipe it up. Check your surroundings: Look at the landscape in which you find yourself and identify high and low points. Look for areas where water would naturally"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"collect. Collect transpiration from the vegetation by wrapping them in plastic bags. The plants will collect moisture through their roots and emit it via the leaves which can be collected. Forests: Most types of forests will have lakes, rivers, streams, and creeks that are your best bet of finding drinking water. You can often hear running water if you listen carefully. Assess the landscape and identify valleys and ravines where water will naturally travel and always head downstream. Grasslands and savannas: Grasslands and savannas are arid or semiarid environments where water is likely to be scarce, but you may be able"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"to find a seasonal stream, river, or watering hole used by animals. Follow the animals, especially large herds traveling early in the morning before sunrise. You may be able to find dry riverbeds. Dig wells in these riverbeds to see if they release any water. Look for the lowest points in the landscape where water will flow. Investigate rock crevices. Jungles and rainforests: Jungles generally receive large volumes of rainfall which you can easily collect by setting up a tent or leaves to direct the rainfall into a container. During certain seasons, rain may be rare. Follow the animals to see where they go to drink. High humidity levels will make it easier to collect water from condensation. Set up metal objects and"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"large surfaces like the walls of a tent to collect and direct water into a container. Large leaves will also work. Many jungle plants can be a source of water, as they trap it in their large leaves, hollow trunks, or roots. Some plants even store water inside their stems and branches. (Be careful to avoid poisonous plants and discolored water.) Mountains: Mountains are a good place to look for valleys and ravines where rivers and streams flow. Snowfall and glaciers near mountaintops will also provide good water for drinking."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Tundra or polar: Cold environments are like deserts because they usually have no liquid water: It is all locked up in ice. However, you can easily harvest this ice and melt it down. Whether you can find actual ice or permafrost, both can be melted down and purified for drinking. Woodlands and scrubs: You may be able to find streams or"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"rivers in these types of habitats. Woodlands, scrubs, and especially other kinds of Mediterranean habitats generally receive a lot of dew in the early mornings which can be collected by shaking it off of the vegetation. You can also source moisture directly from the vegetation by wrapping and sealing them in plastic bags. The plant will absorb moisture through its roots and transpire through its leaves which can be collected in the plastic bags. Coastal habitats: Despite the looming presence of the ocean, you can often find safe drinking water in coastal dunes and forests by digging a well. You can also collect early morning dew from the vegetation and flat surfaces like tents and metal objects. Water Stills"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"You can construct a water still in most environments. They are used to collect condensation from vegetation and from the ground. To build a still, you will need a large, flat, and waterproof sheet (like plastic or tent fabric); a bucket or water container; some rocks or weighted objects; a digging implement (sticks work); and preferably some vegetation. You will need to dig a hole into the ground deep enough to fit your bucket or water container and at least a few feet wide. The hole should be tapered down toward the center. Place your water container in the center of the hole and decorate the walls with lush vegetation. Then, cover the whole with your waterproof sheet using weights around the edges to secure it and a weight in the center so that it droops down. The purpose is for condensation to form on this sheet and drip down into your water container. Sunshine will help to speed this process up. If possible, you can insert a drinking tube into the water container so that you can access the water without disturbing the setup."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Since the water collected by a still is produced through the processes of evaporation and condensation, it is usually safe to drink straight away, as it has been “distilled.” However, you can always boil and filter it just to be safe. Water Purification At this point, you’ve managed to collect some water, but now, you need to purify it. No matter how clean it may look, don’t risk drinking it as is. Water purification involves two main steps: boiling to kill harmful pathogens and filtering to remove toxic chemicals and sediments. Doing just one of these steps is not good enough. Boiling Water collected from the environment should be boiled for at least 10 minutes to ensure that you kill all viruses, bacteria, and parasites."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Sand Filtration Using a few materials, you can easily construct your own water filter. You need some type of water container to fill up from the top and drain from the bottom. You will also need an assortment of filtration materials which can depend on what you have at hand: small rocks/pebbles, gravel, coarse sand/fine sand, charcoal, grasses, cotton wool, or fabric. It is best to thoroughly boil each of these materials before using them in your filter to ensure they are as clean and"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"sterile as possible. You will assemble the filter by placing the finest material layer at the base and assembling coarser materials in each successive layer. Try to ensure each layer is ideally one-inch thick. These are just suggestions, and you will have to work with the materials that are available to you in your environment: The first layer should be something like cotton wool or a wadded ball of fabric. Then, add a layer of charcoal which you can produce with some fire—you can separate this into two layers—dust, and small, crushed pieces. Now, add some layers of dry grass. Next, a layer of very fine sand Then a layer of coarse sand Then a layer of gravel Followed by a layer of small pebbles Top with some larger pebbles. If possible, secure the top of the filter with another layer of fabric to catch any large pieces of debris from entering"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"the filter in the first place. Suspend your filter so that you can pour water at the top and collect it at the bottom. The longer the water takes to filter through, the better! Look for any impurities before you drink it to make sure the filter is working correctly. If the water is still discolored or smells bad, you may need to redesign your setup and add more layers. If you do not have access to a suitable container, you can also use the setup where you have successive layers of fabric to contain the filtration materials. Solar Distillation Similar to the water still mentioned previously, you can use evaporation and condensation to make water drinkable. When water evaporates, it leaves behind all chemicals and pathogens, condensing as pure water. You will need to follow a similar procedure"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"beginning by digging a hole. This method works best with two containers: one with the water needing to be filtered and another to collect the condensation. You can place both containers into your hole and cover it with a waterproof sheet. Make sure the edges of the sheet are secure by packing sand and rocks around the perimeter. Then, place a weight right above your clean collection container to direct the droplets. Over a day or two, the sun will shine down on your solar still and cause the untreated water to evaporate. It will condense on the sheet and drip down into your collection container where you will be able to drink it. Filtration Straws These devices are sold in camping and survival stores. They are thick, tube-like straws that you can use to drink directly from untreated water out in the environment. Inside the tubes are sophisticated filtration systems similar to the sand filters, but they often contain special disinfectants and microfilters that can ensure all heavy metals,"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"toxins, and bacteria will be removed. Filtration straws have a limited life span but are usually quite affordable and are small and easy to carry around. They are an excellent investment for anyone that enjoys venturing out into the wild. LifeStraw, Sawyer, and Membrane Solutions produce reputable filtration straws. Stone Boiling One of the significant limitations of boiling water in a survival situation is that you may not have a heat-proof container that you can safely place over a fire. In this case, you can use the hot rock method. Heat some clean, smooth rocks in a fire and then transfer them into whatever container your water is stored in. This could be a piece of vegetation or animal skin. Keep replacing the rocks as they transfer their heat to the water, and eventually, it will come to a boil. Make sure it boils for at least 10 minutes. T-Shirt and Fabric Filtration Fabric and clothing make a helpful addition"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"to a sand filter but are a last resort when used by themselves.

It is also important to remember that most insects undergo several different stages in their life cycle, including larvae, pupae, eggs, and adults—some of which can offer more nutrition and calories than others. In general though, insect proteins are comparable to traditional “meat.” They meet our requirements for amino acids; monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats; antioxidants, vitamins such as A, B2, B5, B7, B9, C, D, E, and K; and minerals including copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, selenium, and zinc. Table 1 shows some of the macronutrient breakdowns of traditional proteins compared to some insect proteins. You can see that crickets offer more protein per calories than beef, salmon, or even tofu. Insects have a reasonable amount of fat, though some are quite high in saturated fat. Insects also, uniquely, offer fiber in the form of chitin from their exoskeletons, unlike any other kind of mammalian or avian meat."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"It is also easier to identify poisonous bugs than it is to identify poisonous plants.

CATCH IN G BU G S"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Pitfall Trap A pitfall trap is a common feature among bug enthusiasts that can also catch other small prey. A pitfall trap is just a hole in the ground. You should try to make the walls of the hole smooth or place a bucket inside to prevent insects from crawling back up once they fall in. You can also make the sides of the hole tapered with a narrower opening, and it should be deep enough so that jumping creatures cannot escape. You should place a few pitfall traps in different types of habitats to increase your chances of success. Look for places where you can see insect activity, and place one in a moist area under tree cover, another in an open or grassy area, one close to a waterway, one near a rocky outcrop, etc. You can choose to include some bait inside the bucket as well—the most common type is some rotting fruit which can be used to attract beetles. You must also be aware of the different activity periods: Some insects are active in the day while others are active at"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"night. You need to check the traps at different times of the day: from dawn, to midday, to dusk. The pitfall trap will need to be protected so that other animals do not steal your insects. To do this, you can create a roof that sits an inch or two above the opening of the hole. Use rocks as pillars to hold the roof up, and leave enough gaps for insects to pass through and fall into the hole. The roof can also help protect other animals that may be unlucky enough to fall into your trap, like mice or frogs. Nets Nets are another simple way to catch insects like grasshoppers. You can construct a simple net out of many types of materials including clothing, sleeping bags, or tents. Run the net over a grassy area a few times, and you are bound to catch some insects. Light Traps Light traps are also effective for catching several nocturnal insects or those that"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"navigate using the sun or moon.

During the night, this light source will attract several thousands of insects which you can easily scoop into a container. They will be gone by dawn though, so you must collect them during the night. If you are using fire as a light source, practice your fire safety tips and make sure the sheet cannot catch fire.

Finally, a suitable prey animal entered my line of sight, and I watched with bated breath as it meandered into my trap. Everything went exactly as I had hoped, and the trap was released, capturing the animal. But when the time came for me to retrieve my dinner... the sight of me must have given it a sudden burst of adrenaline—enough to break free and run away back into the cover. I had a very sad meal of defeat that evening. I was sure that I would be able to catch an"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"animal, so I spent no time collecting other sources of food—I was low on water, and I didn’t even have enough firewood to last the night. This is one of the major downsides of trying to rely on medium or large prey to survive—they want to live, and they will fight with tooth and nail to escape. Your chances of success are astronomically low. Take a look at how successful some wild predators are in their hunts: Lions are only successful about 20% of the time; wolves and polar bears even less so; and tigers have a measly success rate of about 7.5% (Fair, 2020). My point here is not to dismay you completely—only to emphasize the fact that hunting takes a lot of time and energy which are your two most crucial resources when you are in the wilderness. You should always try to make sure you are stocked up on other essentials like berries, nuts, seeds, insects, water, and firewood before you go out trying to catch prey animals. These plant foods will help to sustain you while you are hunting, and they will be a valuable fallback if your"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"attempts should fail. LO CATIN G AN IM ALS Now that your hopes and dreams of taking down a moose with your bare hands have been dashed, let’s look at some of the ways you can actually increase your chances of success while hunting. When you are out in the wild, the most practical and accessible types of prey animals are going to be the small ones: rodents,"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"rabbits, birds, fish, reptiles, amphibians, and the bugs and insects mentioned previously. You should spend a good amount of time observing the animals by trying to understand their patterns and behaviors, where they feed, where they sleep, where they drink, and where they socialize. Signs of Animal Activity There are several signs that you can look out for out in the wild that indicate the activity of different animals: Footprints: An animal’s footprints can provide a lot of information. You can figure out what kind of animal it is, how big they are, whether they are moving alone or in a group, which direction they are traveling in, and how fast they are moving. Though this skill can take some time to develop, it is also intuitive and simple to figure out. You should try to learn how to identify the footprints of different groups of animals so that you don’t waste your time and effort tracking animals that would be undesirable to try and hunt:"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Cat footprints have four toe pads and one large pad in the middle. They are usually quite round and have no claw marks because the animals hold their claws in the retracted position when walking. Cats come in many different sizes, and their prints reflect this, with house cat prints being very small compared to that of a cougar, for example. Cats walk by placing their hind feet into the print made by the front feet, forming a single track. Canine footprints are similar to cat prints, but they will have distinct claw marks. They can also range in size. Canines do not walk in the same way as cats. Instead, their hind feet will usually produce their own set of prints. Foxes are an exception, with a similar gait to that of felines. Animals from the weasel family will produce footprints showing five toes, each with a claw mark. They are usually very small compared to dog or cat prints and leave a pungent smell behind due to the animal’s scent"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"glands. Animals in the weasel family include weasels, martens, badgers, otters, skunks, minks, wolverines, and ferrets. Bears, raccoons, and opossums can be identified by their footprints because the front feet are different to the back"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"feet. Their back feet are usually more elongated, like a human, whereas the front feet are rounder. They will produce a print with five toes and claw marks on each. Raccoons often have long fingers which are visible in their prints, bears will have distinctively large prints, and opossums have opposable thumbs which are visible in the prints of their front feet. Animals in the rodent family include rabbits, hares, mice, rats, squirrels, gophers, chipmunks, porcupines, hedgehogs, and beavers. Their front feet are different to their back feet with four toes on the front and five on the back. Their back feet are slightly elongated with a noticeable heel portion and usually have visible claw marks. Hares and rabbits have back feet that are much longer than their front feet and will form prints in side-by-side pairs rather than alternating due to their jumping gait. Hoofed animals include even-toed and odd-toed groups. The only odd-toed"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"animals in North America and Europe will be horses and donkeys which are easily identified by their round hooves that have triangular wedges at the back. Even-toed animals include deer, antelope, pigs, boars, cattle, sheep, goats, and camels. Skilled trackers can easily identify deer species from their prints, but this skill can take several years to master. The main takeaways for you are to be able to identify the direction in which the animals are traveling. Most of these even-toed animals will have a pair of teardrop- shaped hooves with two small heel marks. Elk, cows, and bighorn sheep have relatively simple teardrop shapes, whereas deer have more complicated shapes. All will have the pointed end of the teardrop in the front of their foot and the rounded part at the back next to the small heel marks. Birds generally have three forward- pointing toes and one backward- pointing toe on their feet. Owls differ in having one of the forward-pointing"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"toes angled out more to the side and sometimes backward. Some useful features to look out for are the size of the prints and whether they are solitary or in a group. Waterbirds will have webbing in between the toes, and predatory birds will have large talon marks. Reptiles have feet with five toes—one of which is usually much longer than the rest. They have splayed, simple footprints, and you can often see where their bellies lay or were dragged while walking. Reptiles can also gallop at high speeds which will leave marks where their front and back legs fall more in line with each other. Snakes make markings on the ground that are quite distinctive but can be overlooked. They will push sand and debris to the sides as they slither, leaving a shallow mark where they drag themselves. Amphibians have footprints with five toes, each tipped with a large round pad. Their markings will show up well on the muddy banks, or rivers, lakes,"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"and streams. Since they jump, the back feet will usually be found next to each other. Animal trails: Regular animal traffic will lead to well-worn paths and trails, often following the most desirable routes to and from feeding, drinking, and resting sites. You will be able to see footprints and droppings along these trails to confirm whether they are currently being used or not. Animals will use different routes during different times of the year, and some paths may be abandoned. Rubs: Several types of animals will rub against the bases of trees to scratch itches, mark their scent, and to display dominance. You should keep an eye out for trees that are damaged in this way, revealing their pale inner bark. You can tell if the trees have been recently visited by whether or not there is a noticeable scent and by the dryness or wetness of the inner bark. Trees will heal over time if left alone, leaving behind a scar where the animals damaged it. You may also be able to find broken pieces of antler or fur"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"at these sites. Dust baths: Several species of birds partake in dust baths each day. You can identify them by the presence of fine dust or sand and several footprints and feathers. The dust will be highly disturbed. Fur and feathers: While scouting a potential animal trail, look out for any pieces of hair or fur that may get stuck on the vegetation. Thorny and brambly plants will grab onto animal fur and help you to determine what kind of animals may be using the trail. Gnawing and chewing marks: Look for markings on trees, branches, twigs, leaves, grasses, nuts, and even bones. Browsing animals will nibble on a few leaves of a tree before moving on to the next tree. Grazing animals will either chew off the tops of grasses or rip them from their roots. Several types of rodents, especially porcupines, will gnaw on dry wood and dry bones to help keep their teeth healthy. All of these signs can indicate the presence and activity of different animals."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Droppings: Animals can be identified by their droppings. Deer will produce smooth and round pellets made of fine grassy material. Rodents will produce smaller, more elongated pellets, while rabbits and hares tend to produce more spherical pellets. Antelope, goats, and sheep also produce pellets, but they are usually not smooth and contain larger pieces of undigested grass. Beaver droppings will be rich in woody material. Carnivorous animals do not generally produce pellets, and their droppings will be more pungent, containing undigested animal material like fur, bones, and claws. Animals like otters that eat mainly mollusks will have pieces of shell in their droppings. You will need to look at the size, shape, and type of materials in the droppings to identify what kind of animal it came from. Bird droppings also range in color, size, shape, and consistency. Predatory birds can often produce pellets with small pieces of undigested animal parts like bones, feathers, and fur. Insectivore birds will have droppings that contain the exoskeletons of their prey."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"Types of Animals Birds It is crucial to be as quiet as possible when scouting for birds, and you also need to be patient. Some of the best places to find birds will be near water sources where they are"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"forced to land. Whether they are solitary or gregarious birds, they will come to drink early in the morning and often throughout the day as well. Most birds are diurnal, meaning they are active during the day and don’t see well at night. You can use this to your advantage by trying to catch them at dusk when they go for their last drink of the evening. Exploit their roosting spots where they go to sleep each night. Nesting season is a particularly good time to try and catch birds, as many species will not leave their eggs even if they are approached by predators. Their eggs are another good food source you should make use of as well. You can catch birds using nets, either by targeting them in their nests or observing flight patterns—they will choose similar routes through obstacles like trees and crevices which you can exploit. All kinds of birds are edible and safe to eat once cooked properly, but be wary of handling the raw meat: Make sure to wash before and after to avoid the risk of Salmonella infection. Small Mammals"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"Animals like rabbits, hairs, small antelope, or deer can generally be found in greater abundance than larger prey. They are also easier to transport, butcher, and cook. You will need to identify what kind of prey you would like to try and catch, and then, determine where and when they feed. It is useful to be able to identify the tracks and signs of these animals. For example, rabbits and hares may use the same pathways through dense shrubs and grasses, leaving a small highway bare of leaves and debris. Dawn and dusk are usually the best times to try and hunt for small mammals; they are early risers that like to get their day started before the heat of the sun bears down on them. All mammals are edible; however, some mammals can be particularly voracious and will defend themselves against attack. Try to avoid getting bitten or scratched, which could result in a rabies infection. The livers of most apex predators should be avoided, however, due to their toxic levels of vitamin A. Reptiles"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"Most reptiles can be eaten; however, they can be particularly difficult to catch. You should look for lizards, geckos, snakes, turtles, and larger reptiles like caimans, alligators, and crocodiles. The best time to find them is when they are basking in the sun, usually on rocks. They will be particularly sluggish at dawn. Obviously, you will need to be wary of their dangers—many snakes are venomous, and large reptiles can easily make a meal out of you if you are not careful. Reptiles are also a common source of Salmonella infection, and care must be taken to ensure you do not eat them raw if possible; wash your hands thoroughly when you are done handling the meat. Reptiles can be cooked and treated similarly to most birds and will taste best when roasted over a fire, allowing them to brown slightly. Amphibians Frogs, toads, and salamanders can make easy prey. However, you should try to avoid toads because many of them are poisonous. You can tell them apart because toads tend to have"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"drier skin and live in drier habitats, whereas frogs will have moist skin and can always be found near water. You should also avoid any species that have bright coloration or flashy patterns on their skin, as this is also a good indicator that they are poisonous. Most amphibians are nocturnal. You can locate frogs by listening for their croaks in wetlands, swampy areas, and near other types of water sources. You can usually catch them with your hands if you are quick enough, but nets work great, too. Salamanders are slightly rarer though you can spot them swimming in shallow waters if you have a torch. Amphibians are generally skinned before eating, though if you roast them over a fire, their skin is thin enough to burn away. They are a good source of protein. Fish Freshwater and marine fish are all great sources of fat and protein. You can try and catch them using makeshift fishing hooks made from any sharp materials and string or sinew; however, other types of traps would"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"probably work better. You should try looking for fish in clear waters where they are protected from strong currents, especially under the cover of foliage. Almost all freshwater fish are safe to eat, but some can be dangerous. Large catfish or sturgeon would not make easy prey, for example, and their spines can easily cause wounds. There are several poisonous marine fish, but you can usually identify them because they have long, sharp, and showy spines. All fish contain parasites and worms, but marine fish are usually safer and can often be eaten raw. However, you should cook them just to be safe and make them more palatable. Crustaceans Crabs, shrimp, lobsters, crayfish, and other types of shellfish can be found in freshwater and marine environments. Most of them are nocturnal, but some crabs are active during the day. You can usually spot them because they make small breathing holes in the sand. They will often be attracted by meaty bait. A simple way to trap them is to use a container"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"with a small, tapered opening that is easy to get into but difficult to get out of. These can be made with woven grass or plastic waste. You can also catch many types of species with your hands if you dig in the right places —just be careful of nipping pincers. Small shrimp will be found near algal mats on which they feed. You should cook all crustaceans and prepare them by removing the legs, antennae, and gutting them first. Mollusks There are many kinds of mollusks that make"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"for good eating, including clams, mussels, snails, barnacles, squid, and octopi. In freshwater environments, snails and mussels will be the most common, and they are very easy to catch, being slow or completely sessile. Marine species can be found on beaches and in rock pools. Mussels, clams, oysters, and barnacles will stick to rocks and need to be pried off with a knife, while octopi often become trapped in tidal pools and are simple to catch by hand or net. Keep in mind that octopi have sharp beaks that can bite, and their suckers can also be painful. You can also find marine snails on the beach by looking for their air bubbles when the waves move out, though they are also attracted to meat and can be baited. Most marine mollusks can be eaten raw, but some cooking is recommended. Animals with closed shells can be steamed, boiled, or roasted, and the rule is to discard any that do not open once cooked, as they are probably already dead and may carry bacteria. Octopi and squid are best when scored and roasted or fried."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"Starfish and Urchins These animals can provide a good amount of vitamins and minerals but not too much in the way of calories. The best place to find them is in rock pools on the beach. You may need to pry them off of the rocks using a knife or a stick. Most starfish and other kinds of sea stars can be safely eaten after cooking them. Sea urchins can be eaten raw but are also best cooked. You just need to turn them upside down to reveal the mouth where you can insert a knife to crack them open."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"TRAPS Trapping small game is much easier than hunting. Several trap designs can be used to catch different types of animals; you just need to know where to place them. It is best to set up traps where you can see signs of animal traffic. Snare: This is a simple trap that only requires a piece of string or rope. Make a loop and secure it using a knot that can slide up and down, like a noose. Set the loop in an animal pathway or front of a den, and secure the other end to a strong branch or rock. When an animal enters the snare, the slipknot will draw tight around its body. It is critical to check your snares often, as any caught animals will quickly attract the attention of other predators. Spring snare: Snares can also be set up with trigger mechanisms that will activate when an animal becomes trapped. You can use a supple sapling"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"to hoist your snare up into the air, effectively hanging the prey animal and killing it quickly. You will need a snare, some pieces of wood, another long piece of rope, and a springy piece of vegetation to attach it to. There are several types of triggers, though the wedge and the Y-styles are among the simplest. A wedge-style trigger uses two smooth branches. Cut a wedge out of the side from one of the branches, and then, carve a hook from the other branch so that it can fit inside the wedge. Similarly, a Y-shaped trigger uses two Y-shaped branches. They will be set up in a way that the tip of the Y- shapes hooks onto each other. Attach the snare itself to the branch with the hook and a young sapling. Bend over the sapling and secure it in place by setting the hooked branch into the wedged branch. When an animal runs through the snare, it will become trapped, setting off the trigger which will then launch it into the air. A deadfall trap is suitable for small"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"prey that can be crushed with a rock, including rodents and reptiles. A deadfall trap uses a large, heavy rock propped up by a stick, a trigger string, and bait. The purpose is to attract a prey animal to the bait placed underneath the rock. A long trigger string must be attached to the stick so that you can pull on it, causing the rock to fall. Place bait underneath the rock and wait in a hidden area for prey to approach. When they are beneath the rock, pull the trigger string, and hopefully, you can crush the prey animal. You can also avoid crushing the animals by using a box, but this can make it easier for them to escape unless you add weight to the top of the box. Bird box trap: This type of trap is almost identical to a deadfall trap, but instead of using a heavy weight to crush your prey animal, you will use a simple hollow box or cage instead. When triggered, the box will fall on the prey animal, entrapping it. It should not kill the animal. This is useful for"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"catching fowl birds, and you can use seeds or fruit as bait inside. Funnel fish trap: You can make this type of trap using any kind of funnel- shaped object. You can use woven baskets, reeds, twigs, and branches, or a plastic bottle. You will need to build a cage-like structure in the shape of a funnel, and this will be contained inside a larger container to entrap fish. If you use a plastic bottle, you need to cut off the conical end, flip it around, and insert it into the base end. With traps made from plant materials, there will be gaps between the branches or reeds. The size of these gaps must be small enough so that your prey of choice cannot escape through them. Place the fish trap in a location where you have seen fish swimming, and orientate it with the current and fish movements. The fish will be able to enter easily but will not be able to escape. You can catch fish and crustaceans with this type of trap—especially if you place a small amount of bait inside."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"TIPS AN D TRICKS Choose animals that can be found in abundance. Leave your taste preferences at home. When you’ve been without a decent meal for a few days, a roasted raccoon will be just as satisfying as roast beef. Take what you can get. When stalking prey, take your time. It is essential that you be patient and go slowly. This will help you to remain as silent as possible and listen carefully to your surroundings.

They will see you from their perches and make alarm calls. All animals in the vicinity will have learned this alarm call and flee in response. If you notice birds like crows, cuckoos, or other more intelligent species watching you, it’s best to try and find another area to stalk prey. Be opportunistic: Along with leaving"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"taste preferences behind, you may sometimes be met with foods that you cannot eat but can be used to bait other animals. Carcasses should be exploited for their bait potential as well as for materials like sinew. If you use snares or other types of traps, you need to check them regularly! There is nothing more disappointing than finding a bloody mess in a snare, knowing that you managed to trap an animal but had it stolen before you could eat it. Make use of your weapons. If you have good aim, slinging a rock or throwing a spear can make quick work of a prey animal. AFTER A SU CCESSFU L H U N T If you are persistent and lucky enough to catch a prey animal of decent size, your work is not yet over. You need to be wary of your surroundings and look out for opportunistic predators. If you can carry the animal whole"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"back to your campsite, you can do so immediately, but larger prey will need to be gutted and dressed first. You may need to walk back many miles to reach your campsite, and you should have a projectile weapon like a rock sling to deter coyotes or raccoons—not to mention larger animals like bears. Once you begin butchering your carcass, you will also attract smaller animals like rodents and birds who will try to steal small pieces. If you have a rope, suspend your carcass in a tree while you are working on other tasks to make it as difficult as possible for animals to reach it. You can also secure meat in rivers and streams for short periods of time to hide the scent. Just ensure they are securely covered with rocks, so the current cannot wash it away. Fish will take nibbles, though, so only do this with large items. If you are drying your food in the sun or near a fire, you need constant vigilance.

H O W TO BU TCH ER AN D CO O K Bleeding and Hanging It is common practice to cut the throat and then hang the animal upside down by its hind legs to allow as much blood to drain as possible. This can take a few hours for larger game. It will improve the taste and make the meat more tender, as the effects of rigor mortis dissipate. You can choose to collect the blood or not. This step is not necessary, though—especially for small animals. Skinning and Gutting You can eat the skin of many animals— especially birds and mammals. However, some are better and easier to handle when skinned, like frogs or snakes. In some cases, you may want to cook the animal in its skin and then eat only the meat inside, such as an"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"alligator. However, skinning is a simple process that doesn’t take too much effort. You can skin the animal while it is hanging upside down or by laying them out flat on the ground. It is best to skin an animal once the body has cooled down to ambient temperature, making it easier to handle. Begin at the center of the animal’s belly and pinch some skin, pulling it upward. This will help you make a small incision. Use this incision to begin your cut all the way from the throat down to the groin. Make sure you do not pierce the muscles of the abdominal wall. You can use your fingers to separate the skin from the underlying muscles before using a blade. Grab onto the skin and begin teasing and tearing it away from the flesh, pulling toward the sides. Again, use your fingers to break apart the connective tissues or gently slice it with a blade as you pull. This does not take too much cutting force. Pull as far to the sides as you can. For smaller animals, you may be able to pull some of the skin off the arms and legs without needing to make more cuts."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"Once the abdomen and chest is exposed, you can begin to gut and remove the organs. Very carefully, make a small incision into the abdominal muscles right in the center. Great care must be taken not to pierce the intestines which lie right below these muscles. If you pierce the intestines, your meat will become tainted and inedible. Cut a line in the abdominal wall from the base of the ribs and down to the groin. You will be able to pull the muscles to either side to reveal the internal organs. Locate the stomach and the rectum. You can use a piece of string to tie these tubes off before cutting them. This will allow you to remove the entire digestive tract. (Alternatively, you can cut a circle around the anus on the outside of the body; pull the rectum and anus into the body cavity; and discard them with the rest of the digestive tract.) You should discard this away from your processing station. You will also need to remove the bladder at this stage, being careful not to pierce it or spill the contents. Both the bladder and intestines are likely to be full, so be prepared for this."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"Carefully remove the liver and kidneys which you can eat after cooking. Next, you will need to open the rib cage. Depending on the size of the animal, this may be easy or quite strenuous. For smaller animals, you can simply cut through the ribs down the center of the sternum. For larger animals, you will need to cut away at the connecting tissue between the ribs and the sternum. Then, pry the rib cage open. The heart and lungs can also be eaten. The next step is to make cuts on the inside of each limb—from the feet all the way to your central abdominal cut. Make sure to only cut skin, and don’t go too deep as to cut the tendons and ligaments. Tendons and ligaments are astoundingly strong and will quickly dull your blade. The tail may also pose some challenges and should be removed. You can either cut the tail off as is or separate the bones inside so that the tail comes away with the skin. You should now have flaps on the sides of the body that you can pull and peel off. Keep"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"teasing and gently slicing away while you pull until the whole hide comes off. You may need to cut around the neck area, so you can also pull the facial skin off whole. You will need to finish off by cutting at the feet to remove the last few pieces of skin that are still connected. For reptiles and amphibians with thin skin that may tear easily if you pull too hard, you can burn and singe the skin first. This will make it tougher and easier to pull off in one piece. To gut a fish, follow a similar procedure of making an incision into the belly. Again, be careful not to pierce the guts, but once the abdomen is open, you can simply pull them out and discard them. Fish do not need to be skinned."},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"Butchering In a survival situation, you do not need to worry about making aesthetically pleasing cuts. You can simply hack off a leg and roast it over a fire. However, if you do have some time, you can begin by identifying the traditional cuts of meat which are present on all quadrupedal animals—the rump, loin, flank, etc. Cut these off the carcass by slicing with the grain of the tissues. You can also simply cut off the muscular tissue in strips. Try not to avoid the fat, as it can provide essential energy and nutrients."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Butchering a bird is a little simpler, as you can cut off the wings and legs for cooking. The breast must be separated from the keel bone. You can also butterfly a bird by spreading it out flat and cooking it without the need to butcher it prior. Skinning other types of animals will be similar. For fish and snakes, you need to make a small incision near the head or tail and then simply pull the skin away from the muscles underneath. Try to include fat in your cuts, as many wild animals will be very lean. You will need the fat to sustain you. Fat can also be found around the kidneys. Defeathering Birds will need to be defeathered, as their skin is a useful and tasty source of fat that should be consumed. You can do this either by simply burning the feathers away from the skin, or by plucking them out by hand. Boiling the carcass for a few minutes can help to loosen the feathers before you pluck"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"them out. Difficult Animals Certain types of animals will be more difficult to work with than others. Examples include turtles, tortoises, porcupines, hedgehogs, etc. The shells of tortoises and turtles can be more easily removed after you boil them whole. Porcupines and hedgehogs have soft bellies that you can access to carry out the butchering, but be wary of their quills."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"Cooking We have already discussed some of the ways you can cook your wild-caught game. You can boil all types of meat, but you will need a water-tight container to do so, and it is not the tastiest method of cooking meat. You can roast pieces over a fire either using small pieces pierced with skewers or larger and more whole cuts of meat on a spit. You can grill or fry cuts of meat using a hot, flat stone or thin slab of hardwood, and you can also make use of a stone or earth oven to prepare larger pieces of meat. Do not forget to make use of the organs and bones which contain bone marrow. You can use larger bones from the legs and ribs, cooked over a fire, and then smashed open with a rock. Organs such as the liver are a good source of vitamins and minerals, but as mentioned previously, avoid livers from predatory animals.

Chapter 1 provided a comprehensive guide into some of the best types of edibles to look out for, namely the tree nuts, seeds, roots, tubers, berries, and fruit which are all provided by plants. They require very little effort to collect and give you the essential nutrients you need to stay alert, healthy, and alive."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"Some of the most common edible plants you may come across—not only in the wilderness but also in urban areas—include prickly pears, morel mushrooms, chickweed, dandelions, raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries, chicken of the woods mushrooms, amaranth, cattails, and chanterelle mushrooms. These foods often grow in great abundance; they are hardy and tough, thriving in several different kinds of environments across the Northern Hemisphere. However, don't forget the important tips to remember when you struggle to find edible plants. Plants will always need water to survive, and they have many ingenious ways to find it. Look to rocky outcrops and valleys and near the edges of forests where plants are protected. In Chapter 2, we looked into how to go about identifying plants. Knowing some basic tips and tricks can help save a lot of time and energy. Try to keep reading up on botanical terminologies such as the shape of leaves, the type of veins, and the shape of their margins.

They reproduce using cones that have edible nuts inside. Conifers can also be used for their several medicinal properties. The daisy family is made up of some of the most prominent flowers in the world, including daisies and sunflowers. They are always easily recognizable by their flowers which have a central disk surrounded by petals. The grass family comprises several thousand species, making up one of the world’s most important sources of food. All grains come from the tiny flowers sitting on top of the grass stalks.

The mustard family contains quite a few edible plants and can easily be identified by their X- or H-shaped flowers. The parsley family is a tricky group containing several poisonous species that closely resemble edible species. They have lacy leaves and flowers growing in umbrella-like clusters. The pea family, similar to parsley, contains several edible plants as well as toxic varieties. They are also easy to identify, having distinct flowers and producing seeds in pods."},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"Even with all of these identification tips, there are also more rules to keep in mind. As previously mentioned, you should try to avoid eating plants from urban or industrial areas where they may have been exposed to chemical pollutants. Avoid plants that smell strongly of almond, as this indicates the presence of cyanide; also, avoid bitter-tasting or soapy plants. Avoid most plants with milky or discolored sap and try to stay away from unidentified legumes, beans, or seed pods which are often toxic. Most plants in the parsley family are quite dangerous as well. Avoid plants that have physical defenses like spurs, spines, or thorns. Also, only eat mushrooms if you absolutely have to and if you are completely certain that they are a safe variety. The universal edibility test is a useful but long and drawn-out process. You should always opt for plants that you can identify with certainty, but when no other options are available, this is a reliable method for ensuring you do not consume poisonous plants. The main steps of the edibility test"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"include locating plants that are actually abundant and could nourish you, separating them into their different parts, and working with only one part at a time. Then, testing the plant by consuming small quantities and applying it to the skin to detect any amount of irritation will also help. If the plants are able to pass these tests, you can safely rely on them when out in the wilderness, but be sure you note their definition characteristics including habitat, size, appearance, smell, and taste. It is critical to remember some of the most common look-alikes you may come across in the wilderness. Always refer back to the table provided in Chapter 2 in case of doubt to avoid confusing moonseeds with wild grapes or true morels with false morels.

Fires require tinder, kindling, and firewood in order to burn successfully in a survival situation without access to paraffin or other flammable chemicals. We also covered several fire designs, such as the teepee, the log cabin, and the star design— which all have different advantages and disadvantages depending on your needs. Some types of fires are better suited to cooking and providing high heat, whereas others are better at surviving for longer periods of time. Knowing how to start a fire without access to a lighter or matches is critical. You can collect all the firewood in the world, and it will be useless without a spark to ignite it. There are several tried-and-tested methods used by humans all over the world for tens of thousands of years, like the hand drill or fire plow.

Clovers, stinging nettles, acorns, cattail roots, whole violets, plantain leaves, kelp, and bamboo should all be thoroughly boiled or cooked over a fire. All animal foods must also be cooked to rid them of parasites. Chapter 4 looked into some of the ways that you can produce all the amenities you need from nature, including tools, utensils, water containers, cooking containers, cooking apparatus, and weapons. Rocks serve as a valuable raw material for constructing sharp blades if you have the patience to work them, and knowing how to turn plant fibers into strong ropes can help you escape tricky situations.

This chapter also discussed some of the ways you can cook your food using a fire, stove, grill, or oven. Solar cooking is a great way to cook not only in a survival situation, but is also something you should try at home. It requires no electricity and can produce some delectable dishes. Chapter 4 also discussed water; the importance of safe, clean, drinking water; how to find it; and how to purify it. You can find water in almost any habitat, including forests, deserts, grasslands, savannas, mountains, and even coastal habitats—you just need to know where to look. Water stills are one of the easiest and most effective ways"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"to extract water from the environment when you cannot find any on the surface, and they also serve as a way to purify your water of toxins, chemicals, and parasites. Water filtration is another important aspect to consider, and you can easily make highly effective filters using nothing but raw, natural materials. Preparedness and safety was the final highlight of this chapter, emphasizing the need to take care when working with fire and hot objects, as you will not have access to medical care. It is also important to remember that you are not alone when out in wild environments, and there are many dangerous animals who may try to steal your hard- earned foods or defend their territories against you. Be wary, secure your food, and use weapons and fire as a defense. In Chapter 5, we delved into some unconventional edibles, namely insects. Insects are abundant in most habitats, and many various groups are completely safe to eat. Grasshoppers, crickets, ants, termites,"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"grubs, beetles, and many other types of bugs are an excellent choice if you can overcome the crunchy texture. Though many of us would prefer a juicy rabbit or piece of deer meat, insects can provide just as much fat and protein with half the effort. Of course, there are some types of creepy crawlies that are best avoided, including spiders and scorpions. However, with some care and skill, these too can make a great meal in the wilderness. As always, try to avoid those with bright coloration, as they are often poisonous. Moving on from the smaller critters, Chapter 6 provided an introduction to hunting larger animals. One of the main takeaways from this section should be that catching prey animals is difficult; it takes a lot of time and energy; and there is never any guarantee of success. You must always try to balance out your efforts with the potential rewards and the consequences of failure. However, there are many skills that can improve your chances, such as tracking animals by their footprints, identifying signs of activity, and setting up traps in opportune areas. Traps are a great,"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"low-energy alternative to having to chase down an animal with a spear or net. There are many inventive designs suited to different kinds of prey that can significantly reduce the amount of energy you need to spend in catching a decent dinner. You should try to construct your own traps at home to see if they are effective! Finally, Chapter 7 summarized some of the most important wild edibles you are likely to come across. Use this index whenever you are uncertain about a wild edible. It is critical to keep in mind the survival food pyramid, and you need to always ensure that you focus on foraging for foods that are abundant and easy to collect. Time and energy are your most valuable resources, and you cannot afford to waste them in a survival situation where your life is on the line. You can safely rely on the wide range of plants and insects before attempting to catch small animals. Reptiles, amphibians, and eggs from birds are generally much easier to capture compared to birds or small mammals, and large game should be saved for those times when you"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"have already built up a good stock of not only alternative foods but other resources like firewood and water.
