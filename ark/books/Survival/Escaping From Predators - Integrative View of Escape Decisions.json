Thebook consolidates current and new behavior models with taxonomically dividedempirical chapters that demonstrate the application of escape theory todifferent groups. The chapters integrate behavior with physiology, genetics, andevolution to lead the reader through the complex decisions faced by prey duringa predator attack, examining how these decisions interact with life history andindividual variation. The chapter on best practice field methodology and theideas for future research presented throughout ensure this volume is practicalas well as informative.Electronic supplementary material is available for download atwww.cambridge.org/9781107060548 [http://www.cambridge.org/9781107060548].William E.

Subsequently it was negatively reviewed forthe American Naturalist. The reviewer’s comments on the manuscript consisted ofseven question marks, two marginal notes (“I disagree” and “too simplistic”),and the remark “The predictions are more extensions of the model’s definitionsthan deductions” – which we still do not understand. Fortunately, others gaveour model a more sympathetic hearing. Jay Rosenblatt and Colin Beer, who ran theannual publication Advances in the Study of Behavior, invited us to submit amanuscript after hearing LMD speak at the 1984 Animal Behavior Society meetingin Cheney, Washington. We accepted, and are still grateful to them.In contrast to the frustration of pushing it out into the world, the gestationof the model was fun and exciting. The model’s working title was “The economicsof the third F,” referring to the position of “fleeing” among the 4 Fs ofbehavior (feeding, fighting, fleeing, and reproduction). It was conceived at atime when behavioral ecology was just coming into its own at our university andat many others. As we noted in the introduction to the paper, “economic” (thatis, costs and benefits in a fitness framework) ideas were being applied tofeeding, fighting, reproductive and social behavior: the application toantipredator behavior seemed to us a natural step.It was a happy and busy time. The Behavioral Ecology Research Group (BERG) atSFU was coalescing, and we were engaged with plans to host in Vancouver the 1988meeting of the brand new International Society for Behavioral Ecology. We wouldlike to thank the many colleagues who gave us useful input on our model, and wesubmitted a manuscript to “Advances” in April 1985, which was duly published thefollowing year.Thereafter, things went quiet – for a decade. The paper was not cited at all fora few years, then sporadically, and did not receive more than ten annualcitations until 1997. Thereafter it has been cited more often in each subsequentyear, as in the mid-90s the number of papers on escape began to climb. Thisincrease was just one part of the swelling interest in antipredator behavior.In spite of having been cited many hundreds of times, the basic model in “Theeconomics of fleeing from predators” has not received much rigorous scrutiny. Itdoes so in this volume, and we are a little embarrassed to agree that, strictlyspeaking, it is wanting. Perhaps the referee whose comments we castigated abovehad a point after all! But if the criticisms were justified, they also missedthe bigger picture, something that Professors Rosenblatt and Beer saw moreclearly. Our model expressed the predator–prey interaction in a simple way thatcaptured the essence of an idea that was in the air. In spite of itsshortcomings, it provided a conceptual framework and suggested an empiricalapproach in a way that inspired many investigators to undertake their ownstudies.The benefit of escape from predators has always seemed obvious – in fact,blindingly so. Few thought of fleeing as a “decision,” or saw that there werecosts, most notably lost opportunity, i.e., a fleeing animal cannot performother fitness-enhancing activities. Many prey escape to a refuge, and it seemednatural to us to use the same approach to ask how long animals should remainbefore re-emerging. This interesting question requires a game theoreticapproach, of which we anticipate much more in future work.These two prey decisions – flight initiation distance and hiding time – havebeen the subject of most work and represent the majority of the researchsummarized in the present volume. But the field has expanded to consider othersorts of escape decisions, such as how far and in what direction to flee, preystrategies while being pursued by predators, and alternative tactics whenfleeing is not feasible. The range of species in which these issues has beenaddressed is impressive, as Part II amply demonstrates. Particularly interestingis the recent work on genetics of escape, and the role of individual personalitydifferences (the shy–bold continuum). Research described in Part III, on thephysiology of escape, holds the promise of a more quantitative predictive theorythan has existed to date. This will benefit the application of this work toanimal welfare and conservation, as discussed in Chapter 16[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#CN-bp-16].We are gratified that our work led to such an explosion of empirical andtheoretical studies and contributed to the growth and maturation of an importantsubdiscipline of behavioral ecology. As the editors say in their introductorychapter, “The story is still unfolding, and many aspects of our topic have notyet been addressed theoretically and many generalizations and exceptions remainto be discovered through empirical studies.” This book should go a long way tofurthering the development of this exciting field.We had always intended that “escape” be interpreted more broadly, as a generalmetaphor for decisions about antipredator behavior, with costs and benefits. Theimportance of antipredator behavior was first grasped in foraging, and is nowbeginning to be appreciated in the evolution of a broad range of phenomenaincluding migration, metamorphosis, hibernation, clutch size, and others –classical topics that have rarely or never in their historical developmentconsidered that the risk of predation might be vital. Basic ecological topicssuch as population dynamics and community structure are being reshaped by therealization that facultative adjustments to danger have profound impacts thatcan be enormous in extent (kilometers and years) relative to the small (minutesand meters) behavioral changes that individuals make.In closing we’d like to draw attention to an important point that continues tobe misunderstood. How should “predation risk” be assessed? Many ecologistsevidently think that risk can be assessed by the level of mortality.Accordingly, situations with low mortality are considered “safe.” But, is thisso? In previous commentaries we have made analogies with pedestrians (as prey)and cars (as predators), and noted that one could observe a busy downtown streetfor a long time and never observe a “predation event” (i.e., pedestrian struckby car). The situation is obviously dangerous for pedestrians, but they arestruck infrequently because they are cautious. The analogy is imperfect (unlikereal predators, drivers are generally careful of pedestrians) but it makes thepoint that mortality per se is a poor measure of risk. The “true” level of riskis the mortality that would occur if pedestrians were completely heedless. Itmust be assessed by techniques such as “flight initiation distance” or“giving-up density” (or, to pursue our analogy, how far a pedestrian would go touse a crosswalk rather than to jaywalk). This insight has turned the meaning ofrisk upside down. Rather than mortality setting the level of antipredatorbehavior, we see now that antipredator behavior sets the mortality rate. Andbecause danger management also influences reproduction, an animal population,through the behavioral decisions of its members, in effect sets its own lifetable! It would be too much to claim that this startling conclusion could bededuced solely from our model’s simple premises. As in all science, thecross-fertilization of ideas and data, such as those presented in this volume,is essential. However, we feel it is not too much to claim that this simplemodel, with all its shortcomings, opened a window that gave a differentperspective on an everyday phenomenon. Read this volume and enjoy the view.Ronald C. YdenbergLawrence M.

CooperJr. and Daniel T. Blumstein1.1 ESCAPE, FITNESS, AND PREDATOR–PREY ENCOUNTERSPrey that do not escape when attacked by lethal predators die. Even prey thatsuffer non-lethal injuries inflicted by predators may incur substantial costs,such as reduced ability to reproduce, reduced social status, reduced ability toforage, and reduced ability to escape in later encounters with predators.Unsuccessful escape reduces fitness. A prey that is killed by a predator losesall fitness that might have been obtained in the future. More technically,residual reproductive value (expected remaining reproductive output over alifetime) becomes zero when a prey is killed. Therefore predator–preyinteractions have been a major force driving evolutionary changes to reduce thelikelihood of predation. Numerous, often spectacular, antipredatory adaptationshave evolved, including morphological defenses such as shells and otherarmature, weaponry, camouflage, and the ability to shed tails or otherexpendable body parts.In addition to such adaptations, prey that rely on escape to avoid predationmust be able to make appropriate escape decisions when confronted by predators.The degree of predation risk posed by a predator that is approaching or isimmobile nearby determines expected loss of fitness if the prey does not flee,i.e., the cost of not fleeing. This cost of not fleeing varies with distancebetween predator and prey when escape begins, and in some cases with the lengthof time that the predator approaches or is immobile nearby. Besides avoidingbeing eaten, prey must do many things to maintain themselves and increase theirfitness, such as foraging and defending foraging grounds, courting, mating, andaggressively interacting with sexual rivals. When fleeing interrupts an activitythat increases fitness, it imposes a cost of fleeing. Therefore each time a preyencounters a predator, the prey has a current level of fitness. The greater itsfitness, the more the prey has to lose if killed.In everyday usage, escape seems to be a simple term, but misleadingly so. If wethink of a prey and predator that meet, the prey may flee and/or enter refuge toescape. However, prey may employ other defenses that allow them to escape in abroad sense, including avoiding areas where predators occur, avoiding detectionby predators, and a variety of chemical, mechanical, and aggressive defensesthat come into play when a prey has been overtaken by a predator. These are allfascinating topics, but are not included in this book.Predator–prey encounters are sometimes described in terms of sequential stagesfrom a predator’s perspective, beginning with detection by the predator,identification, approach, subjugation, and consumption (Endler 1986[OEBPS_Text_part0009.xhtml#REFe-r-1.3]). Other descriptions of encounters takeinto account both the predator’s and the prey’s awareness and actions (Lima &Dill 1990 [OEBPS_Text_part0009.xhtml#REFe-r-1.6]). From the prey’s perspective,the encounter begins when the prey detects the predator and ends when thepredator moves away or when the prey has escaped or been killed. The defensesused by prey vary during the stages from predator’s viewpoint. Camouflage andimmobility, for example, are important for reducing the likelihood of beingdetected or identified, whereas autotomy and weapons are used during thesubjugation stage, and defenses such as spines and biting of tails to roll intoa ball too large to be swallowed are employed to prevent consumption.Material in this book is limited to prey behaviors that occur during briefpredator–prey encounters. Thus occupation of predator-free habitats to avoidpredators is excluded. When it has detected a predator, a prey monitors thepredator during the approach stage. Alternatively, monitoring may occur as theprey approaches the predator or when both are immobile. The prey may at sometime begin to flee. If it flees, it may or may not be pursued by the predator.The prey may enter a refuge where it is safe from the predator. If it enters,the prey must decide how long to stay in the refuge before emerging. If thepredator overtakes the prey, the prey may deploy one or more of several defensesin response to imminent or actual physical contact with the predator. The latterdefenses are not discussed in this book. In this book the focus is on escapebehavior and processes leading to escape decisions. The processes leading toescape decision begin when the prey detects and starts to monitor the predatorand last throughout the monitoring phase. When the decision to flee andinitiation of escape behavior have occurred, further evaluative processes mustoccur related to the prey’s strategies to evade the predator during pursuit,refuge entry, and time spent hiding in refuge.All times and defenses outside the above intervals are omitted, but have beendiscussed elsewhere. Three excellent recent books review knowledge of them.Antipredator Defenses in Birds and Mammals (Caro 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0009.xhtml#REFe-r-1.2]) describes the broad range of thesedefenses for two taxa. In Animal Camouflage: Mechanisms and Function, Stevensand Merilaita (2011 [OEBPS_Text_part0009.xhtml#REFe-r-1.10]) describe evidencefor several means of avoiding detection by predators. Importantly for ourdiscussion, the probability of being detected is reduced by camouflage, whichshould influence the decision by prey to flee. Because risk of being detected islower for camouflaged prey, they should permit closer approach before fleeingthan more conspicuous prey. In Avoiding Attack: the Evolutionary Ecology ofCrypsis, Warning Signals and Mimicry, Ruxton et al. (2004[OEBPS_Text_part0009.xhtml#REFe-r-1.9]) discuss ways in which prey avoid beingdetected, avoid being attacked if detected, and some defenses that may be usedwhen contact with the predator is unavoidable. Some of the defenses treated byRuxton et al. (2004 [OEBPS_Text_part0009.xhtml#REFe-r-1.9]) affect theprobability of being detected or of being attacked and are important for ourtopic because they affect predation risk, which in turn affects decisions toflee and hide.1.2 FOCUS AND GOALS OF THIS BOOKThis book fills the gap left by the three recent books between defenses used toavoid being attacked and defenses used when contact with the predator isunavoidable. Interest in escape behavior has grown steadily since publication ofthe first model that predicts how closely a prey will allow a predator toapproach before fleeing based on costs to fitness of not fleeing and of fleeing(Ydenberg & Dill 1986 [OEBPS_Text_part0009.xhtml#REFe-r-1.12]).Both theory and data have been accumulating a quickening pace. Several newmodels of escape, refuge use, and related behaviors that appeared during the1990s and 2000s are discussed in some detail in a chapter on escape theory(Chapter 2 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#CN-bp-2]). Numbers of publicationsrecovered in a citation analysis search for a few of the major escape terms(approach distance, flight initiation distance, flush distance, hiding time, andlatency to emerge) showed that numbers of publications and citations increasedmore than twenty-fold in a search spanning the years 1994 to 2013 (Figure 1.1[OEBPS_Text_part0009.xhtml#FIGm-fig-1]).[OEBPS_Images_image00896.jpeg]Figure 1.1Citation analysis shows increasing numbers of articles and citations on escapebehavior since the early 1990s. An ISI Web of Science search conducted on July21, 2014 searching the terms following terms: “flight initiation distance” or“flush distance” or “hiding time” or approach distance” or “latency to emerge”.Citations for 2014 appear to be fewer because the analysis was done mid-year.The bulk of research by the editors has been about evolutionary and ecologicalaspects of escape decisions, and the development and testing of modelspredicting effects of various factors on escape variables. The core of the bookthat reflects our research interests is in Part II[OEBPS_Text_part0008.xhtml#PTN-bp-1], which presents economic and other modelsof escape and refuge use, and empirical data that tests their predictions.However, a full understanding of escape behavior requires a broader approach. Inaddition to the focus on economic escape decisions, the book presents anintegrative view of escape behavior, refuge use, and prey behavior duringpursuit. This material follows the chapters on theory and factors affectingescape decision in a series of chapters about behaviors that occur before escapethat may affect it, determinants of locomotor performance that is crucial toescape, physiological underpinnings of escape, maternal and genetic influences,personality traits, and use of information about escape behavior to informwildlife management and conservation practices.Our goals are to present the accumulated knowledge gained from these and earlierstudies in an accessible form, interpret the findings using current theory, andto synthesize work to date. We sincerely hope that this book will stimulate newresearch. The interplay between theoretical and empirical studies of escape is amajor success story in behavioral ecology because theory now permits manytestable predictions that have been extensively verified. The story is stillunfolding, and many aspects of our topic have not yet been addressedtheoretically and many generalizations and exceptions remain to be discoveredthrough empirical studies. Studying escape and refuge use in the field is funand has provided us many memorable experiences. Laboratory experiments on thesebehaviors can also be exciting and satisfying to conduct. Developing newtheoretical models of escape behavior often leads to very rewarding moments ofinsight. Join us in this research endeavor.1.3 ESCAPE THEORY AND DATAThe interplay and trade-offs among factors that affect predation risk, cost offleeing, and the prey’s current fitness are the core features of theoreticalmodels of escape and related behaviors. These models predict decisions by preyabout whether to flee, how close to allow a predator to approach before fleeing,or how long to keep still before fleeing when an immobile predator is nearby,how far to flee, and how long to hide in a refuge. In Chapter 2[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#CN-bp-2], Cooper presents a number of graphicalmodels, optimality models, and game theoretical models of escape behavior,hiding time in refuge, and related behaviors. Some of the models are highlysuccessful at predicting important, yet limited, features of escape behavior,especially decisions about when to start fleeing. Other models are novel.Predictions of cost–benefit models of escape and refuge use have been testedextensively and permit interpretation of the effects of numerous factors thataffect predation risk, cost of fleeing or emerging, and the prey’s fitness atthe outset of the encounter on escape and emergence decisions. In addition,variables not predicted by current economic theory affect the trajectoriesadopted when fleeing begins and changes in trajectory and speed used to foilpursuit.In Chapters 3 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#CN-bp-3] to 9[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#CN-bp-9] we summarize our empirically obtainedknowledge about economically based escape. Major taxa differ in many ways thatmay affect escape capacities and decisions. In Chapters 3[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#CN-bp-3] to 7 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#CN-bp-7] wepresent our empirical knowledge of escape in major taxa: Theodore Stankowich andEigil Reimers (mammals), Anders Pape Møller (birds), William E. Cooper, Jr.(reptiles), Philip W. Bateman and Patricia A. Fleming (fish and amphibians, and,in a separate chapter, invertebrates). These chapters emphasize decisions abouthow close to let the predator approach before fleeing, how long to remain closeto an immobile predator before fleeing, how far to flee before stopping if notpursued, and whether to enter refuge. In addition to these variables, factorsinfluencing the initial direction of fleeing are discussed for some prey. InChapter 8 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#CN-bp-8] Paolo Domenici and Graeme D.Ruxton present information about initial directions of escape flight and aboutstrategic changes in prey escape behavior during active pursuit by predators. InChapter 9 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#CN-bp-9] Jose Martín and Pilar López detaildecisions about time spent hiding in refuge. Slight overlap occurs among certaintaxonomically oriented chapters and Chapters 8[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#CN-bp-8] and 9 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#CN-bp-9],and the cases of overlap are cross-referenced.1.4 THE REST: RELATED BEHAVIORS, LOCOMOTOR PERFORMANCE, PHYSIOLOGY, GENETIC ANDMATERNAL INFLUENCES, PERSONALITY DIFFERENCE, BEST PRACTICES FOR FIELD STUDIES,AND CONCLUSIONSWhereas most of the material in the preceding chapters deals with ultimatecauses, i.e., those having been molded by evolutionary processes, Chapters 10[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#CN-bp-10] to 15 [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#CN-bp-15]discuss a mixture of factors affecting escape. In Chapter 10[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#CN-bp-10], Guy Beauchamp discusses behaviorsincluding vigilance, alarm calling, predator inspection and monitoring, andpursuit-deterrent signaling. All of these behaviors can affect the ability ofprey to make economic assessments of risk or the likelihood that a predator willattack. Therefore they can affect escape decisions. These behaviors have beennaturally selected, and effects of all of them except perhaps vigilance onescape decisions have ultimate interpretations. Natural selection favorsvigilant prey, but prey that are not vigilant may be forced to flee when thepredator is closer than the optimal distance for initiation of escape.Proximate causes of escape behavior are discussed in Chapters 11[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_000.xhtml#CN-bp-11] to 15[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#CN-bp-15]. In Chapter 11[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_000.xhtml#CN-bp-11], Kathleen L. Foster, Clint E.Collins, Timothy E. Higham, and Theodore Garland, Jr. present determinants oflocomotor performance. Variation in the physiological capacities of prey to fleemay explain variability in escape decisions among individual prey, populations,and species. Running, swimming, or flying speeds, acceleration, climbing andjumping ability, and endurance all are variable and should be taken into accountby prey in assessing risk of being captured. Locomotor capacities placephysiological limits of escape speed and other aspects of escape locomotion, andin this sense may be considered to be proximate causes of such aspects of escapebehavior. In addition, these limits presumably affect escape decisions asultimate causes because the risk assessment process must evolve to takelocomotor abilities into account. Chapter 12[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#CN-bp-12], by Luke P. Tyrrell and EstebanFernández-Juricic, covers aspects of sensory ecology important for escapedecisions.In Chapter 13 [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#CN-bp-13] Yoav Litvin, D. CarolineBlanchard, and Robert J. Blanchard discuss the physiological bases of escaperesponse. Physiological factors in escape behavior include neuroendocrinemechanisms of escape, including sensory bases of fleeing, and energetic costs offleeing. Less is known regarding maternal and genetic effects on escapebehavior, but some laboratory studies have begun to examine the development ofescape behavior and to separate effects of the maternal environment from genetictransmission of escape traits. These topics are discussed by Lesley T. Lancasterin Chapter 14 [OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#CN-bp-14]. Animal personalities havereceived increasing attention in recent years. A frequent finding has been thatsome individuals are consistently shyer or bolder than others, i.e., flee sooneror later during approaches or emerge later or sooner from hiding, respectively.In some species shyness and boldness are correlated with a variety of othertraits to form adaptive suites of behaviors. In Chapter 15[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#CN-bp-15], Pilar López and Jose Martín discuss theliterature on these personality traits and avenues for future research.In Chapter 16 [OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#CN-bp-16], Daniel T. Blumstein, DiogoS. M. Samia, Theodore Stankowich, and William E. Cooper, Jr. discuss bestpractice for conducting field studies of escape behavior, a topic that we hopewill be useful given differences in methods reported in the literature amonginvestigators and recent findings that require new methods. In the final chapter[OEBPS_Text_part0032.xhtml#CN-bp-17] the editors summarize and synthesize whatwe have learned about the diverse escape topics.1.5 A STANDARDIZED TERMINOLOGY FOR ESCAPE AND TIME SPENT HIDING IN REFUGE1.5.1 CURRENT AMBIGUITY IN ESCAPE TERMINOLOGYStudies of escape behavior and refuge use have often been done by investigatorsinterested in a particular prey taxon. In some cases traditions using differentterms for identical variables have developed for different taxa. The distancebetween a prey and an approaching predator when the prey starts to flee has beencalled reaction distance in many studies of fish; flush distance or flightdistance, in studies of birds and mammals; and approach distance or flightinitiation distance in studies of various taxa. Different terms for the samevariable may be used in different subfields of escape studies, particularlybetween wildlife biologists and behavioral ecologists. In some cases, a singleterm may have multiple meanings. For example, flight distance is used to meanboth predator–prey distance when escape begins and how far the prey flees beforestopping.Use of these diverse, conflicting, or ambiguous terms for different t taxa andin different conceptual fields of biology has at least two detrimental effects.One is confusion. Readers may be misled if they do not carefully examine thedefinitions of variables in methods sections. Sometimes the variables are notdefined clearly, requiring the reader to assess the meaning from the study’scontext. The other primary problem with current terminology is that it makesliterature searches difficult. This has affected researchers who were unaware ofsome synonyms.In this section we hope to ameliorate such terminological problems byrecommending a set of terms for standardized usage. We follow this terminologythroughout the book and recommend that the terms defined be used in futurepublications on escape behavior and refuge use. Additional terms specific totheir topics will be presented in Chapter 10[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#CN-bp-10] for escape trajectories and pursuit. InChapter 17 [OEBPS_Text_part0032.xhtml#CN-bp-17] we discuss set-back distance,one of several termsused in conservation biology and wildlife management.1.5.2 TERMINOLOGY FOR DISTANCE VARIABLES AND PROPORTIONSStanding distance is the distance between an immobile prey and a predator thatis immobile nearby. This term originated in studies in which researcherssimulating predators stand still at some distance from a prey.Starting distance (SD) is the distance between prey and predator when thepredator begins to approach. Synonym – start distance.Detection distance is the predator–prey distance when the prey detects thepredator. Detection may be cryptic if it occurs before alert (see alertdistance). For experiments in which prey are aware of the predator when approachbegins, detection distance may be considered to be greater than or equal tostarting distance. However, such experiments are of no value for determiningdetection distance.Pre-detection distance is starting distance minus detection distance. This thedistance approached by the predator before it is detected by the prey.Alert distance (AD) is the distance between a prey and an approaching predatorwhen the prey responds overtly to the predator by change of posture ororientation to monitor the predator. Synonym – alerting distance.Minimum bypass distance (MBD) is the predator–prey distance at the point on thepredator’s path closest to the prey. This is zero for direct approaches thatlead to contact with the prey. It increases as the approach angle (see below)increases to a maximum of 90° and increases as starting distance increases.Minimum bypass distance is greater than zero for all indirect, i.e., tangential,approaches.Proportion (or percent) that flee (or fled). This refers to the proportion ofindividuals. Synonym – responsiveness. Proportion that flee is preferred becauseresponsiveness, despite having the advantage of brevity, is not specific toescape and has multiple possible interpretations.Flight initiation distance (FID) is the distance between a prey and anapproaching predator when the prey begins to flee. Synonyms – approach distance,escape distance, fleeing distance, flight distance, flush distance, minimumapproach distance, and reaction distance. Flight initiation distance ispreferred as the clearest term. Approach distance was used frequently in theliterature on economic escape, but might be confused with the distance thepredator travels during its approach. Flight distance was recommended by Taylorand Knight (2003 [OEBPS_Text_part0009.xhtml#REFe-r-1.11]), but it is ambiguousand has been used to mean both flight initiation distance and distance fled.Flush distance is too specific for general use, being restricted to prey taxa.Escape distance and fleeing distance might also be misinterpreted to meandistance fled. Reaction distance has been used in recent reviews of escape byfish, but is less informative than flight initiation distance and might apply toother phenomena.Buffer distance is alert distance minus flight initiation distance(Fernández-Juricic et al. 2002 [OEBPS_Text_part0009.xhtml#REFe-r-1.4]). Thisterm suggests that long alert distance provides greater distance (and time) forrisk assessment prior to fleeing. This term is distinct from buffer zone, whichis the space within which human activity is restricted to reduce disturbance towildlife (Camp et al. 1997 [OEBPS_Text_part0009.xhtml#REFe-r-1.1]). Synonym –assessment distance would highlight the relationship with assessment time, butwe prefer buffer distance because it is established.Margin of safety (MOS) is the distance that would separate an approachingpredator from its prey when the prey reaches refuge. A refuging prey must selecta flight initiation distance that will permit it to reach refuge before thepredator. The margin of safety is the predator’s distance to refuge when theprey enters the refuge.Distance fled (DF) is the distance between a fleeing prey’s starting and endingpoints if the prey is not pursued by a predator. Synonyms – escape distance,flight distance. Distance moved is preferred by Taylor and Knight (2003[OEBPS_Text_part0009.xhtml#REFe-r-1.11]), but is not specific to studies ofescape. A literature search for distance moved revealed thousands of papers thatincluded distance moved, but the vast majority were irrelevant for escape.Nearest approach distance is the distance between an immobile predator and aprey that is approaching it when the prey stops approaching. This term appliesto prey that typically flee away from predators. Some prey may approachpredators to counterattack or distract them, such as crabs that bite, autotomizethe biting leg, and then flee (Robinson 1970[OEBPS_Text_part0009.xhtml#REFe-r-1.8]). Others may approach to mob predators(Owings 1977 [OEBPS_Text_part0009.xhtml#REFe-r-1.7]; Gehlbach and Leverett 1995[OEBPS_Text_part0009.xhtml#REFe-r-1.5]). Approaching to deploy a defensivealternative to fleeing is excluded from our topic. Nearest approach distance asused here is inappropriate to describe such behaviors. For prey that approachapproaching predators to escape, nearest approach distance may also be anappropriate, accurate term.Proportion (or percent) of individuals that enter refuge. This refers to theproportion of the individuals observed.Proportion (or percent) of individuals that emerge before a trial is terminatedafter a predetermined time in refuge. Self evident.1.5.3 TERMINOLOGY FOR TEMPORAL VARIABLESDetection latency is the time between the beginning of the predator’s approachand its detection by the prey.Escape latency is the time between onset of a sudden startling stimulus and theprey’s first detectable reaction. In fish this occurs on a scale ofmilliseconds.Latency to flee has different meaning in different contexts. When a predatorapproaches an immobile prey, latency to flee is the elapsed time betweenstarting time and the time when the prey begins to flee. When an immobile preyhas detected an immobile predator nearby, latency to flee is the time betweendetection of the predator and initiation of escape behavior. In experiments inwhich a predator approaches and stops near a prey that has detected it, this isthe time when the prey flees minus the time when the predator stops.Assessment time is the time spent monitoring the approaching predator beforefleeing. For prey that exhibit alerting responses, assessment time is definedoperationally as the time between alerting and initiation of fleeing. However, aprey may have detected a predator and have been monitoring its approach prior toadopting an alert posture. In many experiments using prey that do not showalerting, the prey may detect the predator before approach begins. Even if preydo not become aware until after the approach begins, assessment time isproblematic for prey species that do not show overt alerting behaviors.Margin of safety (temporal margin of safety) is the expected time betweenarrival at a refuge by a fleeing prey and arrival by the predator. Maintaining amargin of safety requires prey to assess arrival times based on relativevelocities of predator and prey.Hiding time (HT) is the elapsed time between entry into a refuge and emergencefrom the refuge. In typical experiments, trials are terminated if a prey doesnot emerge within a fixed maximum time. Therefore estimates of mean hiding timeoften underestimate the true mean hiding time and longer mean hiding times maybe found using longer cut-off times. Synonyms – emergence time, latency toemerge, submergence time. Hiding time is preferred because it is used relativelywidely and does not present numerous false positives during literature search,which is a problem that plagues searches for the synonyms that have alternatemeanings unrelated to escape behavior.1.5.4 TERMINOLOGY FOR DIRECTIONAL VARIABLESIdeally, escape paths would be measured by vectors giving speed and directionthroughout the encounter and would be related to similar information for thepredator. This is not generally done and such vectors are more difficult tomeasure than the two-dimensional directions usually presented. We often measureonly initial directions with no indication of escape speed. To indicatedirections in Euclidian space when no information about speed is available, unitvectors could be used. In most studies of escape by non-volant terrestrial preyand even by some prey that escape in three dimensions, only two-dimensionalangles have been measured. However, take-off angle, the vertical angle abovehorizontal, is an important aspect of the initial escape response by birds,grasshoppers, and presumably other insects. For prey escaping in air or water,the dive (swooping) angle or ascent angle of the predator is very likely toaffect the degree to which the prey flees upward or downward. Prey that jumpalso may vary their vertical take-off angles. Climbing and descent angles ofterrestrial and arboreal prey on slopes, logs, and trees may affect both escapespeed and the speed and ability of predators to follow, both of which may affectpredation risk, and, therefore, escape decisions. Other prey might vary theangle of rapid burrowing in sand or loose dirt. The terms listed below are thetwo-dimensional angles used in escape studies.Approach angle has three distinct meanings. One is the difference in degreesbetween two predators simultaneously approaching a single prey. The other use ofthis term occurs in studies of effects of directness of approach by a predatoron escape decisions. In the latter case approach angle is the angle from theapex point where the predator begins to approach between a line of directapproach and the actual linear approach path. In the third case, approach anglerefers to the angle between the line of attack by the predator and the bodyorientation of the prey. We prefer the following two terms in this case.Attack angle is the angle between the predator’s line of approach and the bodyorientation of the prey. It has range of 0 to 180°. The attack angle is 0° whenthe prey is directly facing the predator and 180° when the prey is orienteddirectly away from the predator.Stimulation (or stimulus) angle is equivalent to attack angle, but is used insituations in which the stimulus does not approach the prey, such as when asudden sound is presented experimentally.Direct approach is movement by the predator on a straight line toward the prey;the approach angle is 0°.Tangential approach is movement by the predator along a straight path that doesnot lead to contact with the prey, but bypasses it. For tangential approaches, aminimum bypass distance (see above) is associated with each combination ofstarting points and approach angles. Synonym – indirect approach. Tangentialapproach is preferred because it emphasizes that the tangent line from the preyintersects the predator’s path at the its closest point to the prey. Indirectapproach may be used for contrast with direct approach, but the tangentialnature of approach should be made clear.Escape trajectory (ET) is the path taken by a fleeing prey. In typical studies,the initial escape trajectory is linear at a fixed angle in relation to thedirection of the predator’s position. Escape trajectory is often defined as thisinitial angle of fleeing. However, the prey’s path may change during pursuit, asin classical mathematical models and cases in which prey make evasive maneuverssuch as gradual or rapid turns, or even if no pursuit occurs. An escapetrajectory of 180° is directly away from the predator; an escape trajectory of0° is directly toward the predator. In some studies escape trajectories areconsidered to span 0 to 360°. In that case a distinction between sides may bemade in one of two ways. In one, the right side of a circle corresponds to 0 to180° and the left side to 180 to 360°. In the other, when a prey turning to fleeends with the threat on the opposite side of the prey’s body than before theturn, escape trajectory falls in the range 0 to 180°; when turning to flee endswith the threat of opposite side opposite side of the prey’s body than beforethe turn, the trajectory lies in 180 to 360°. Thus there are three commonly usedmeasures of escape trajectory, two measured on a normal 360° scale and one on anaxial (180°) scale. It is important to distinguish between these twointerpretations of the escape direction and between circular (360°) and axial(180°) scales, which require use of different circular statistics. For detaileddescriptions of the three types of ET, see Chapter 8[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#CN-bp-8]. Synonyms – flight angle, escape angle. Weprefer escape trajectory because this term has long been used in mathematicalmodels of pursuit and in studies of escape by fish. Escape angle and flightangle may vary during pursuit, differing among the prey’s positions along thepath, the angular changes through space defining a trajectory. Because moststudies have measured only the initial direction taken by the prey, the escapeangle and escape trajectory defined as a direction for brevity are identical.Escape angle is the angle of the prey’s initial escape with respect to thepredator’s approach path. It is typically measured on an axial scale of 0 to180° as discussed for escape trajectory. As noted, these angles may changeduring escape, in which case the path, or trajectory is altered. Synonyms –escape trajectory, flight angle. Escape angle is preferred over flight anglebecause flight angle may also refer to aerial flight in contexts other thanescape.Turn angle is the angle between the prey’s body axis before the attack and itspath during the initial phase of fleeing. It usually spans 0 to 180°, but can belarger if, for example, the prey turns in circles.Directionality is the proportion of prey that rotate or bend their bodies in adirection directed away from the predator or predatory stimulus during theinitial phase.1.6 ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALFor several chapters space did permit full coverage of certain topics or datathat may be useful to researchers.

Cooper, Jr.2.1 INTRODUCTIONDespite its crucial role in surviving attacks by predators, escape behavior hasreceived far less theoretical attention from animal behaviorists than othertopics, such as foraging and social behavior. Nevertheless, our understanding ofescape decisions by prey in certain contexts has been advanced greatly byconsidering the fitness costs and benefits of escape. Because these costs andbenefits of fleeing and hiding have not been measured in fitness units, themodels do not permit precise quantitative predictions. They do allow predictionsat the ordinal level about effects of greater and lesser levels of factors thataffect predation risk and factors that make fleeing costly. Several economicmodels of escape behavior now routinely provide qualitatively accuratepredictions about aspects of fleeing and refuge use. Here, I review thesemodels, develop a model for a scenario not previously treated theoretically, anddevelop a rubric in which models are placed according to the relative movementsof predator and prey. I also discuss alternative approaches to modeling escapedecisions and models of behaviors during predator–prey encounters that occurbefore fleeing.2.2 FIRST ECONOMIC MODELS OF ESCAPE AND TIME SPENT HIDING IN REFUGE2.2.1 ESCAPEMuch theoretically based empirical research on escape has focused on flightinitiation distance (FID), the distance between a prey and an approachingpredator when the prey begins to flee (Lima & Dill 1990[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.39]; Lima 1998[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.38]; Stankowich & Blumstein 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.47]). Several other terms are synonyms ofFID in some publications, most notably approach distance, flush distance, andflight distance (Chapter 1 [OEBPS_Text_part0009.xhtml#CN-bp-1]). Flightinitiation distance is the least ambiguous of these terms and is now the mostprevalent. The term “flight distance” should be avoided in future researchbecause it is sometimes used to mean flight initiation distance, but in othercases denotes distance fled by the prey. Although escape initiation distancemight be preferable to flight initiation distance because some readers mightthink that flight refers to flying, flight initiation distance is the best ofestablished terms and will be used here.Economic modeling of escape behavior began with a graphical model by Ydenbergand Dill (1986 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.52]) that remains useful over25 years later. Ydenberg and Dill (1986 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.52])assumed that prey often do not flee immediately upon detecting (and becomingaware of) an approaching predator, but monitor the predator’s approach untilfleeing becomes advantageous. As the distance between predator and preydecreases, the cost of not fleeing increases because the risk of predationincreases. Many factors affect the degree of risk at a particular distance.These include the predator’s speed and directness of approach, body size, theprey’s detectability, and body armor (Stankowich & Blumstein 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.47]; Cooper 2010a[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.14]). The cost of fleeing is primarily aconsequence of losing opportunities to feed, engage in social activities such ascourtship, mating, and territorial defense, and to perform other activities thatincrease fitness. Although usually small, energetic costs of fleeing and risk ofinjury as a consequence of fleeing are other costs of fleeing. As thepredator–prey distance decreases, the opportunity cost of fleeing decreases.This is because less must be foregone by fleeing because the prey has had moretime during the predator’s approach to feed, drink, or engage in socialactivities.Ydenberg and Dill (1986 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.52]) proposed thatprey begin to flee when cost of not fleeing and cost of fleeing are equal. Intheir graphical model, flight should occur at the intersection of the fallingcost of fleeing and rising risk curves (Figure 2.1[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#FIGm-fig-2]). As long as the cost of fleeing isgreater than the cost of not fleeing, the prey remains where it is. When thecost associated with predation risk and cost of fleeing are equal, the preybegins to flee because in the next instant cost of not fleeing becomes greaterthan the cost of fleeing and thereafter the cost of not fleeing growsincreasingly larger than the cost of fleeing.[OEBPS_Images_image00897.jpeg]Figure 2.1Ydenberg and Dill’s (1986 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.52]) graphicalmodel of flight initiation distance (FID) when a predator approaches an immobileprey that monitors its approach. The horizontal axis is the distance betweenpredator and prey. The vertical axes are the cost of not fleeing, which isprimarily expected loss of fitness due to predation risk, and the cost offleeing, which is incurred when fleeing leads to loss of opportunities toenhance fitness at the prey’s current location. The predicted FID, d*, occurs atthe distance where the cost of not fleeing and cost of fleeing curves intersect.Modified from Ydenberg and Dill (1986 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.52])If the costs were known in exact fitness units, it would be possible to predictflight initiation distance exactly. Ydenberg and Dill’s (1986[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.52]) model and subsequent economic modelsare useful because they permit us to make ordinal level predictions about whichof two risk levels or which of two costs of fleeing is associated with greaterFID. Cost of not fleeing is expressed as cost associated with predation risk or,in shorthand, predation risk.Many factors affect predation risk (sensu the danger of being killed if noantipredatory behavior is used; Lank & Ydenberg 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.36]) at a given distance between predatorand prey. If two identical predators approach at different speeds, the risk tothe prey at any particular distance is greater during the faster approach. Ifthe cost of fleeing is the same in both cases, the cost of not fleeing and costof fleeing curves intersect farther from the prey when the cost of not fleeingcurve is higher (i.e., FID is longer when cost of not fleeing is greater, Figure2.2b [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#FIGm-fig-3]).[OEBPS_Images_image00898.jpeg]Figure 2.2The predicted FID, d*, is (A) longer for the higher of two cost of not fleeingcurves when there is a single cost of fleeing curve and (B) longer for the lowerof two cost of fleeing curves when there is a single cost of not fleeing curve.Terms are d*H for high cost and d*L for low cost.Modified from Ydenberg and Dill (1986 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.52])If a prey has a feeding opportunity (or other opportunity to enhance fitness),its cost of fleeing is greater at all non-zero distances than that of a preywithout a feeding opportunity (Figure 2.2a[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#FIGm-fig-3]). Consequently, if the two prey have thesame cost of not fleeing curve, the predator is closer to the prey at theintersection of the cost of not fleeing and cost of fleeing curves for the preyhaving the higher cost of fleeing curve (i.e., FID is shorter when cost offleeing is greater).The Ydenberg and Dill (1986 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.52]) model hasbeen modified by Blumstein (2003 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.3]) toinclude three zones (Figure 2.3a [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#FIGm-fig-4]). At theshortest predator–prey distances, prey flee as soon as they detect a predator.The shortest zone of predator–prey distance, zone I, extends from distance d = 0to dmin, the shortest distance at which prey assess risk rather than fleeingimmediately upon detecting the predator. In a range of longer distances, zoneII, prey make economic decisions based on costs of fleeing and not fleeing asdescribed by Ydenberg and Dill (1986 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.52]).Zone II extends from dmin to dmax, the maximum distance at which cost–benefitconsiderations affect escape behavior. (Equivalently, dmax is the maximumdistance at which prey assess risk either because they cannot detect thepredator or the predator isn’t relevant/poses no risk at longer distances.) ZoneIII includes all distances longer than dmax. Prey in zone III do not flee.Stankowich and Coss (2007 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.48]) recognize thesame three zones (see also Chapter 3 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#CN-bp-3]).[OEBPS_Images_image00899.jpeg]Figure 2.3Responses of prey to predators differ in three ranges of distance. (A) InBlumstein’s (2003 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.3]) version, prey fleeimmediately without assessing risk and cost when they detect predators at closerange in zone I. Assessment occurs in zone II, which begins at dmin andcontinues at all distances in zone II, which ends at dmax. Modified fromBlumstein (2003 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.3]). Prey may or may notdetect predators in zone III, but do not monitor them attentively. (B) If preyflee immediately in 0 ≤ d ≤ d*, as predicted by the models of Ydenberg and Dill(1986 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.52]) and Cooper and Frederick (2007a[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.19], 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.21]), dmin< d* does not exist. Therefore,zone I extends from 0 ≤ d ≤ d*, zone II from d* < d ≤ dmax and zone III is whered > dmax.Reasons for non-responsiveness by prey in zone III include failure to detect thepredator, inattentiveness to activities at long distance, and the perceptionthat predator–prey distance is too great for the predator to pose an immediatethreat (Blumstein, 2003 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.3]). Stankowich andCoss (2007 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.48]) added that risk is notassessed in zone III. This is clearly so when the predator is not detected, butis trivial because there has been no predator–prey encounter from the prey’spoint of view. On the other hand, prey might appear to be inattentive becauseperceived risk is too low to justify incurring monitoring costs. An interestingpossibility is that prey in zone III that assess risk as being very lownevertheless monitor the activities of predators there, but appear to beinattentive because they monitor predators at intervals rather thancontinuously, reducing monitoring costs. More empirical work is required tounderstand the proximate processes occurring in zone III.Prey are always expected to flee immediately if a predator is detected closerthan the economically predicted FID. Therefore the regression of predator–preydistance when the predator is detected on FID should have a slope of 1 onpredator–prey distance in the range 0 to d*, the economically predicted FID. Aslope that did not differ significantly from 1.0 was observed in the teiidlizard Aspidoscelis exsanguis for approaches starting between 0 and 1.5 m(Cooper 2008 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.13]). The intercept, too, didnot differ significantly from 0 (Cooper 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.13]). As zone I has been conceived,assessment occurs in the interval between dmin and d*. However, if escape occursimmediately when at d < d*, dmin = d*. In that case zone I is 0 to d*.If flight begins immediately for d ≤ d*, the zones are modified (Figure 2.3b[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#FIGm-fig-4]). Zone 1, the zone of immediate flight,includes distance 0 to d*. In zone II, the zone of monitoring and assessment, d*< d ≤ dmax. In zone III, the non-response zone, the predator is even fartherfrom the prey at d > dmax. Non-response to an approaching threat may indicateeither (1) an inability to detect a predator beyond dmax, (2) detection withtrue lack of any consequent alteration of behavior, or (3) less intensemonitoring than occurs in zone II.Stankowich and Coss (2007 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.48]) proposed thatfor prey capable of detecting predators at long distances, higher values of dmaxcharacterize more reactive prey. Such prey would begin cost–benefit assessmentsat longer predator–prey distances than less reactive prey. Among prey havingsimilar reactivity, scanning rate affects the predator–prey distance at whichprey become aware of approaching predators. In Columbian black-tailed deer(Odocoileus hemionus columbianus), 38.5% of individuals had detectedinvestigators before they began to approach, whereas 61.5% became aware sometime after approach began (Stankowich & Coss 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.48]). Because awareness is inferred by analert posture and orientation to the approacher, this finding is consistent withdifferences in either reactivity or scanning rate.The qualitative predictions of Ydenberg and Dill’s (1986[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.52]) model and the optimal escape modeldescribed below have been spectacularly confirmed for diverse prey and factorsaffecting predation risk and cost of fleeing (Stankowich & Blumstein 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.47]; Cooper 2010). The models are veryuseful for predicting decisions about when to begin fleeing by immobile preythat are able to monitor an approaching predator’s behavior and distance. Othermodels are needed for situations in which prey are moving and both prey andpredator are still.2.2.2 TIME SPENT HIDING IN REFUGEThe basic escape model was adapted by Martín and López (1999[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.41]) from Ydenberg and Dill’s (1986[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.52]) escape model to predict the time spentby a prey before emerging from a refuge after having been chased into one(Figure 2.4 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#FIGm-fig-5]). In the model distancebetween predator and prey is replaced on the horizontal axis by time spent inrefuge and the variable measured is latency to emerge, also called emergencetime or hiding time. Hiding time is preferable to emergence time, which alsorefers to other phenomena, especially times of hatching or metamorphosis.[OEBPS_Images_image00900.jpeg]Figure 2.4The latency to emerge from refuge after fleeing from an approaching predator(hiding time) is predicted to be t*, which occurs at the intersection of thecost of emerging and cost of not emerging curves.Modified from Martín and López (1999 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.41])The vertical axes of this model are cost of emerging (risk) and cost of notemerging (Figure 2.4 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#FIGm-fig-5]). Cost of emergingdecreases as time spent in refuge increases because the predator is increasinglylikely to have left the area as latency to emerge increases. Cost of notemerging increases as time spent in refuge increases because prey loseopportunities to conduct various activities and, in ectotherms, because bodytemperature falls during stays in cool refuges, requiring basking or otherthermoregulatory behavior upon emergence and decreasing running speed andtherefore escape ability (Martín & López 1999[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.41]; Polo et al. 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.44]; Cooper & Wilson 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.27]). A prey is predicted to emerge when therisk of emerging equals the cost of not emerging.Many of the same predation risk factors and opportunity costs that affect flightinitiation distance also affect hiding time. The hiding time model has beenparticularly successful in increasing our understanding of the effects ofthermal costs of refuge use (Martín & López 1999[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.41]; Polo et al. 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.44]; Cooper & Wilson 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.27]). Some empirical studies have shown thatrisk associated with entering a refuge associated with presence of a predatorinside it affects decisions to enter the refuge (Amo et al. 2004[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.1]).The hiding time model can be generalized to include effects of the costs ofemerging or not emerging due to presence of predators and opportunities outsidethe refuge, and costs of remaining in or leaving the refuge due to predationrisk and opportunities in the refuge (Figure 2.5[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#FIGm-fig-6]). In the expanded model, the cost ofemerging includes predation risk present in the original model and an additionalcost of losing benefits that might be obtained by staying in the refuge. Thecost of remaining in the refuge includes both the loss of opportunity availableoutside the refuge and the risk inside the refuge, primarily due to presence ofanother predator.[OEBPS_Images_image00901.jpeg]Figure 2.5If a predator is present outside the refuge and a different predator is insidethe refuge, the cost of emerging and cost of not emerging curves each are givenby the sum of two costs. The total cost of emerging is the sum of cost due topredation risk outside and loss of benefits that might have been obtained insidethe refuge. The total cost of not emerging is the sum of the cost due to risk ofpredation inside and cost of losing opportunities outside the refuge. Thepredicted hiding time, t*, occurs at the intersection of the total cost ofemerging and total cost of not emerging curves.The risk of emerging and loss of benefits in the refuge upon emerging decreaseas hiding time increases. The opportunity cost and predation risk associatedwith remaining in the refuge increase as hiding time increases (Figure 2.5[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#FIGm-fig-6]). The total cost of emerging is the sumof the cost of emerging due to outside risk and the loss of inside benefits.Similarly, total cost of remaining in the refuge is the cost of lostopportunities outside and predation risk inside the refuge. The predicted hidingtime occurs when the total cost of remaining inside equals the total cost ofemerging (i.e., at the intersection of the two total cost curves, Figure 2.5[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#FIGm-fig-6]). All costs are in expected fitnessunits. It is apparent that the original hiding time model (Martín & López 1999[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.41]) is a special case of the model inFigure 2.5 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#FIGm-fig-6] when there are no risks and nobenefits to be gained inside the refuge.2.2.3 ASSUMPTIONS AND RESTRICTIONSIn both the escape and hiding time models, the cost functions are sometimesshown as linear and sometimes as curvilinear. The precise relationships betweenpredator–prey distance and time spent in refuge and the costs of fleeing oremerging and of not fleeing or emerging are unknown, but the predictions holdfor a wide range of functions. As predator–prey distance increases, cost of notfleeing is assumed to decrease and cost of fleeing to increase. However, becausecost of fleeing is largely opportunity cost, the cost of fleeing curve may behorizontal or nearly so if opportunity is absent or meager.Cooper and Vitt (2002 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.26]) examined theseassumptions for the Ydenberg and Dill (1986[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.52]) model. Their findings are describedhere for escape, but similar considerations apply to emergence from refuge. Twoor more cost of not fleeing curves are assumed to have identical values whenpredator–prey distance is zero. The cost of fleeing when predator–prey distanceis zero is assumed to be zero. Exceptions may occur. If the risk factor islethality of the predator, the expected loss of fitness is greater for morelethal predators or more vulnerable prey when the predator contacts the prey(Cooper & Frederick 2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.21]). Cost offleeing at distance zero may be greater than zero for prey that have some chanceof surviving contact with a predator, and the cost may differ among predatorsthat impose different opportunity costs, such as differing times spent inrefuge.Imagine that two predation risk curves intersect with each other and intersectat different points with a cost of fleeing curve and that investigators areunaware that the risk curves intersect. Predictions about relative FIDs for thetwo risk curves based on their magnitudes closer to d = 0 than theirintersection would be erroneous because the lower risk curve in this intervalintersects the cost of fleeing curve at a longer distance (unless there aremultiple intersections between risk curves). For predictions to hold, the costof fleeing and not fleeing must be monotonic or precisely known. If anon-monotonic cost of not fleeing curve intersects more than once with a riskcurve or a non-monotonic risk curve intersects more than once with a cost offleeing curve, multiple predicted flight initiation distances exist, each forsome distance interval.The graphical models of Ydenberg and Dill (1986[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.52]) and Martín and López (1999[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.41]) apply to a wide range of functionsrelating predator–prey distance or time in refuge to cost curves (Cooper & Vitt2002 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.26]). These models have had greatheuristic value and have been very successful in empirical tests. Their maintheoretical drawback is the requirement that fleeing or emerging can occur onlywhen the curve for cost of not fleeing intersects the curve for cost of fleeing,or the curves for cost of emerging and cost remaining in refuge intersect. Thisissue is addressed by optimality models.2.3 OPTIMALITY MODELS OF ESCAPE AND REFUGE USEOptimality models predict that animals select behavioral options that maximizetheir fitness. In the present context, this implies that prey decide to initiateescape behavior at the FID for which their fitness at the conclusion of theencounter is greatest or to emerge after the hiding time that maximizes fitnesswhen the encounter has ended. Optimality models have been used extensively instudies of foraging behavior (Stephens & Krebs 1986[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.49]), but only two optimality models ofescape have been published, one for FID (Cooper & Frederick 2007a[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.19], 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.21]), the other for hiding time (Cooper &Frederick 2007b [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.20]). As discussed below,the Ydenberg and Dill (1986 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.52]) model isnot an optimality model because the predicted FID may be associated with lessthan optimal fitness.Optimality models of foraging fell out of favor in the mid-1980s for variousreasons, especially the presumed inability of animals to make precisely optimaldecisions (Stephens et al. 2007 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.50]).However, they had enormous heuristic value and led to advances in ourunderstanding of foraging behavior and social behavior. For the most part,optimal escape theory is used to make ordinal level predictions, notquantitative ones such as those made by optimal foraging theory. Nevertheless,at our current level of understanding of escape behavior, optimality models, aswell as simple cost–benefit models, remain very useful and have led tosubstantial improvement in our understanding of escape decisions.In Cooper and Frederick’s (2007a [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.19], 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.21]) optimality model for FID, the optimalFID is the product of predation risk (based on distance) and a term thatincludes the prey’s initial fitness, benefits that it may gain during theencounter with the predator, and energetic cost of fleeing. All of these termsexcept initial fitness vary with predator–prey distance, permitting calculationof fitness associated with each flight initiation distance. The optimal flightinitiation distance is the predator–prey distance with the highest expectedfitness. If all benefits gained during the encounter are lost when the prey iskilled, the sum of initial fitness, benefits, and energetic cost is multipliedby the probability of survival to determine expected fitness. However, ifbenefits are retained after death, as for successful reproduction, fitness isestimated by adding the benefits and energetic costs to the product of the sumof initial fitness and energetic cost with probability of survival.The prey begins with initial fitness F0. In both the optimality and Ydenberg andDill (1986 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.52]) models of FID, benefits arezero at distance dd at the outset of the encounter. The benefit function B(d)increases as the predator draws nearer (i.e., as d decreases). The maximumbenefit that may be obtained during the encounter is B*, which is obtained at d= 0. This is because the prey has additional time during the approach to obtainbenefits when it allows the predator to come closer. The benefit function in themodel is B(d) = B*[1 – (d/dd)n], where dd is the distance at which the preydetects the predator and beyond which benefits cannot be obtained, n is theexponent setting the rate of change in B with respect to d. The benefit functionand other terms in the fitness equation might have various mathematicalexpressions. The energetic expense of fleeing is E(d) = fdm, where d distance, mis the exponent relating expense to d, and f is a proportionality constant thatis the slope if m = 1. The probability of survival is 1–e−cd, where c is therate constant for exponential decay, if contact with the predator is alwayslethal. These variables and parameters are summarized in Table 2.1[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#TBLm-tblw-1].Table 2.1 Parameters and variable for the optimal flight initiation distancemodel.Bbenefits in fitness units obtained by the prey during the encounterB(d)functionrelating benefits obtained to predator–prey distance dB*maximum possiblebenefits, which are attained at d = 0crate constant for exponential decay inprobability of survival as d decreasesdpredator–prey distancedddistance at whichthe prey detects the predator and at which benefits may start toaccumulateE(d)energetic expenditure required to flee when the predator–preydistance is dfproportionality constant affecting energetic expenseF0the prey’sinitial fitness (when the encounter begins)mexponent setting the change inenergetic expense in conjunction with dnexponent setting the rate of change inbenefits with distanceWhen all benefits obtained during the encounter are lost if the prey is killed,the prey’s expected fitness if it starts to flee at distance d is F(d) = [F0 +B(d) – E(d)][1 – e−cd], 0 ≤ d ≤ dd. If the prey obtains reproductive benefits oraugments fitness by kin selection that are retained if the prey is killed, theequation becomes F(d) = [B(d)] + [F0 – E(d)][1 – e−cd], 0 ≤ d ≤ dd. In thelatter equation initial fitness is lost, but the benefits remain.The optimal FID occurs at the distance where the derivative F′(d) = 0 (and thesecond derivative < 0, Figure 2.6 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#FIGm-fig-7]).Because no analytical solutions for F′(d) exist, the effects of varying modelparameters must be studied by simulation. The model predicts that the optimalFID increases as initial fitness and predation risk increase and decrease asbenefits increase. The optimal FID decreases as the constant f and the exponentm in the escape cost term decrease due to increasing energetic cost. Only themodel that allows retention of benefits predicts that prey should accept greatrisk or death if benefits are large enough and increase rapidly when thepredator is very close.[OEBPS_Images_image00902.jpeg]Figure 2.6In optimal escape theory the prey’s expected fitness increases as benefits thatit obtains during the predator’s approach increase. In the absence of predationthe total fitness would be the prey’s initial fitness, F0, plus benefits gainedat distance d. This total fitness is discounted by the increasing probability ofbeing captured as the predator draws nearer. The distance at which expectedfitness is maximized is the optimal flight initiation distance, d*, whichdecreases as the maximum benefit, B* (obtained by not fleeing), increases andincreases as initial fitness increases. The remaining parameter is dd, thepredator–prey distance when the prey detects the predator and can startaccumulating benefits.Modified from Cooper and Frederick (2007a[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.19])The optimal FID model has been generalized to account for the degree of predatorlethality (Cooper & Frederick 2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.21]) bymodifying the term for survival to (1 – L(e−cd), where L is the proportion offatalities among prey contacted physically by the predator. The optimal FIDincreases as lethality (L) increases (Figure 2.7[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#FIGm-fig-8]). The generalized model can predict FIDfor factors having complex influences on escape. Consider autotomy, thevoluntary shedding of a body part to facilitate escape when overtaken by apredator. Autotomy of the tail by lizards is beneficial because it increases theprobability of escape. However, in subsequent encounters with predators, initialfitness is lowered for autotomized individuals because they have decreasedreproductive output and growth. Also, lizards that have lost a portion of thetail are less able or unable to use autotomy unless and until the tail hasregenerated. Thus predator lethality is greater for autotomized than intactindividuals. Decreased ability to obtain benefits and slower running speed byautotomized lizards are predicted to increase FID. Formerly, it was widelybelieved that FID should increase after autotomy. However, the optimal escapemodel shows that FID may increase, decrease, or be unaffected by autotomydepending on the balance of effects of autotomy on fitness, lethality, runningspeed, and ability to obtain benefits.[OEBPS_Images_image00903.jpeg]Figure 2.7For fixed initial fitness, predation risk curve and benefit curve, the optimalFID (d*) increases as the lethality (= L, the proportion of prey that thepredator kills upon contact) increases.Modified from Cooper and Frederick (2010[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.21])The optimal hiding time and FID models are isomorphic. In the optimal refuge usemodel, time since entering refuge replaces distance as the horizontal axis andin all variables affecting survival and benefits. Optimal hiding time increasesas predation risk upon emerging and initial fitness increase and decreases asbenefits obtainable upon emerging increase (Cooper & Frederick 2007b[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.20]).2.4 COMPARISON OF THE GRAPHICAL AND OPTIMALITY MODELSSimulations using a range of values for costs, benefits, and initial fitnessshow that prey can increase their fitness at the end of the encounter to a valuegreater than their fitness at the outset of the encounter by selecting theoptimal FID or hiding time (Cooper & Frederick 2007a[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.19],b[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.20]). This is not possible according to thegraphical models discussed above. The best that a prey can do in the graphicalmodels of FID and hiding time is to flee or emerge when the costs of performingthe activity equal the costs of not performing it. These graphical models andtheir mathematical equivalents (Cooper & Frederick 2007a[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.19]) have been characterized as break-evenmodels to contrast the fitness consequences of the predicted behavioraldecisions with those of optimality models, which allow more profitabledecisions.The graphical models do not explicitly consider the prey’s initial fitness,which is an important omission because FID and hiding time are predicted toincrease as initial fitness increases according to the asset protectionprinciple (Clark 1993). However, initial fitness could be considered a predationrisk factor because more is at risk when initial fitness is greater. Using thatapproach, graphical models predict longer FID for greater initial fitness, asdoes optimal escape theory. Qualitative predictions about effects of initialfitness are identical for the break-even and optimality models. Moreover,qualitative predictions of the two types of models are identical for all factorsaffecting predation risk and cost of fleeing or cost of not emerging.The two types of models are equally useful for predicting FID and hiding time inalmost all circumstances. The only exception occurs when prey can performactivities during the approach or upon emerging from a refuge that allow them toincrease their fitness after the encounter to a value greater than its initiallevel. In some extreme cases this occurs even if the prey dies because it doesnot flee or because it emerges too soon. For example, a prey might enhance itslifetime fitness by obtaining fertilizations during an approach even at the costof not fleeing and being eaten. This accounts for prey, such as male black widowspiders (Latrodectus spp.) and male preying mantises (Mantis spp.), that, ratherthan fleeing, approach their predators to trade their lives for fertilizations.Cooper and Frederic (2007a [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.19]) suggestedthat such cases cannot be accommodated by the Ydenberg and Dill (1986[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.52]) model because fitness cannot beincreased if prey flee when the two cost curves intersect. Consider a graphicalmodel similar to the Ydenberg and Dill model except that cost curves do notintersect. Such cases could be represented by a cost of fleeing curve on whichcost of fleeing is greater than the cost of not fleeing at all distances or viceversa (Figure 2.8 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#FIGm-fig-9]). Suppose that there isno cost of fleeing or that the cost of fleeing is always less than the cost ofnot fleeing (Figure 2.8a [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#FIGm-fig-9]). Such cases maynot exist in zone II. Any intersection would fall in zone III, but would notaffect risk assessment. This situation, which may occur when a lethal, efficientpredator approaches and no large benefits can be obtained during the encounter.Immediate fleeing is required upon detecting a predator in zone II despite theabsence of intersection of the cost curves. This prediction is similar to thatof the original zone model (Blumstein 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.3]) when prey detect predators in zone IIcloser than the intersection where cost of not fleeing exceeds cost of fleeing.Alternatively, it is similar to the prediction of modified zone model presentedabove when prey detect predators closer than the optimal FID. The possibilitythat zone II is longer for more efficient predators has not been studied. Thelack of intersection in Figure 2.8b [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#FIGm-fig-9] canbe interpreted as predicting zero flight initiation distance because cost offleeing is greater than cost of not fleeing at all distances, which might occurwhen prey can obtain large reproductive benefits and/or the predator has lowlethality or its approach implies low risk.[OEBPS_Images_image00904.jpeg]Figure 2.8Ydenberg and Dill (1986 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.52]) envisioned costof not fleeing and cost of fleeing curves whose intersection determined d*, thepredicted FID. However, if the curves do not intersect (at least in zone II, theassessment zone) the model applies to broader circumstances. (A) If the cost ofnot fleeing curve is above the cost of fleeing curve everywhere in theassessment zone, prey should flee as soon as a predator is detected at theboundary of zones II and III, dmax = d*. (B) If the cost of fleeing curve isalways higher than the cost of not fleeing curve when d ≥ 0, prey should allowthe predator to overtake it. This corresponds to the case in optimal escapetheory in which the prey gains enough fitness through reproduction during thepredator’s approach to justify loss of fitness expected by contact with thepredator.With the addition of predictions about prey behavior in the cases ofnon-intersection of the cost curves depicted in Figure 2.8[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#FIGm-fig-9], the Ydenberg and Dill (1986[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.52]) model and its later modificationsdiscussed above become much more flexible. They apply to all of the situationsin the optimality models and make the same qualitative predictions. Quantitativepredictions of the graphical and optimality models differ, but that currently isinconsequential because we cannot determine the relevant fitness values. Givenfitness values, the relative merits of the models would become an empiricalmatter. Until the relevant fitness components can be measured, the two types ofmodels may be used interchangeably. The term break-even model, implying thatprey flee when expected loss of fitness due to predation risk equals expectedfitness gained during the encounter, applies to the graphical models only if thetwo curves intersect.2.5 FLUSHING EARLY: EFFECTS OF STARTING DISTANCE AND ALERT DISTANCE ON FLIGHTINITIATION DISTANCE2.5.1 STARTING DISTANCE: AN UNEXPECTED CHALLENGE TO ECONOMIC ESCAPE THEORYStarting distance (SD), the predator–prey distance when the predator begins toapproach, has an effect on FID that is highly variable and has been difficult toexplain. Blumstein (2003 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.3]) found that FIDincreased as SD increased in many birds. Since then, SD has been shown to affectFID in mammals (Stankowich & Coss 2007 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.48]),a crab (Blumstein 2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.4]), and some lizardspecies (Cooper 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.11], 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.13]; Cooper et al. 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.29]; Cooper & Sherbrooke 2013a[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.24]). Among lizards FID did not vary with SDin several species of ambush foragers that were approached slowly (Cooper 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.11]; Cooper & Sherbrooke 2013a[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.24]). However, FID increased markedly as SDincreased in active foragers (Cooper 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.13]; Cooper et al. 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.29]) and, in one ambushing species,increased slightly at fast, but not slow, approach speeds (Cooper 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.11]).The effect of SD on FID was difficult to understand, and its basis wascontroversial. Previously studied factors that affect escape have obviouseffects on cost of remaining, cost of fleeing, or both, but the possible effectof SD was obscure. In economic escape theory, a prey monitors a predator as itapproaches and decides to flee based on predation risk and cost of fleeing,neither of which are obviously affected by SD.Blumstein (2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.4]) proposed a possibleeconomic basis in the flush early hypothesis: prey start to flee shortly afterhaving detected a predator to lower the cost of monitoring the predator duringits approach. Prey need not flush immediately upon detecting predators, butsometimes do. A recent model suggests that cryptic prey should flee immediatelyor not at all (Broom & Ruxton 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.6]). Incontrast, in the flushing early model, FID increases as monitoring costsincrease. Flushing early matches the effect of SD on FID for a prey that hasdetected a predator, but is reducing monitoring cost the cause of thisrelationship?Spontaneous movement (i.e., leaving its earlier position before a prey detects apredator) might account for an increase in FID with increase in SD, especiallyfor very long SDs. Spontaneous movement also might occur after detection of thepredator, leading to increase in apparent FID as SD increases. Such spontaneousmovements might generate artifactual increases in the estimates of FID, causingapparent FID to be longer than the FID based on economic decisions. Differencesin spontaneous movement rates might account for the differences in effect of SDbetween ambushing and actively foraging lizards (Cooper 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.13]). Such differences probably explain someof the difference in effects between foraging modes, but not all, because ratesof spontaneous movement by actively foraging lizards are very unlikely to behigh enough to account for large effects at short SDs.The artifactual portion of the effect of spontaneous movement may be reduced oreliminated in prey species that indicate awareness of a predator by staring atand orienting toward it. The predator–prey distance at which this occurs is thealert distance, AD (Blumstein et al. 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.5]). Because FID is correlated positivelywith alert distance (Stankowich & Coss 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.48]), the relationship between SD and FIDcannot be entirely due to spontaneous movement by prey that have not detectedpredators.Alert distance has its own limitations. Prey may be aware of predators beforeadopting alert postures and may monitor them less intently then. This may occurwhen prey detect predators in zone III (Fig. 2.2[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#FIGm-fig-3]). Some prey deter pursuit by signalingthat they have detected the predator (e.g., Ruxton et al. 2004[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.46]; Caro 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.7]; Cooper 2010b[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.15], 2011a[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.16],b[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.17]; Chapter 10[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#CN-bp-10]) and in some cases the signals are alertpostures (Holley 1993 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.33]). In such caseseffects of signaling and alert distance per se may be conflated, and this mayreduce the apparent effect of alert distance because FID is shorter forsignaling than non-signaling prey (Cooper 2011b[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.17]).After becoming alert, a prey monitors the predator approaching prior to fleeing.This interval between alerting and fleeing is assessment time (Stankowich & Coss2007 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.48]; Chapter 1[OEBPS_Text_part0009.xhtml#CN-bp-1]). The spatial interval corresponding toassessment time is AD to FID (Chapter 1 [OEBPS_Text_part0009.xhtml#CN-bp-1]).Monitoring in these intervals matches the scenario of economic models. Alertdistance is preferable to SD because larger artifactual effects due tospontaneous movement and statistical constraints (Dumont et al. 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.32]) occur for SD.Dumont et al. (2012 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.32]) examined therelationship between SD and AD for SD ≥ AD to assess the utility of SD as aproxy for AD when AD is difficult to ascertain. By conducting traditionalstatistical analyses of data for the marmot Marmota marmota using AD as acovariate, they showed that AD and the previous activity of marmotsinteractively affected FID. Similar analysis using SD as the covariate revealedno such effect. When the assumption that SD ≥ AD ≥ FID ≥ 0 is incorporated intothe null hypothesis, SD and AD were unrelated. Dumont et al. (2012[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.32]) suggested that there is no biologicallymeaningful relationship between SD and AD. They concluded that SD may be amisleading substitute for AD, but there is no evidence that this conclusionapplies widely. They claim that the effect of SD in the range from SD to AD isentirely artifactual. This agrees with the interpretation that spontaneousmovements account for any effects of SD in that distance range. However, when SDis short enough for prey to be aware of the predator before the approach begins,the artifact is absent. At longer SDs, use of SD as a proxy for AD is currentlythe only option when AD cannot be ascertained. As discussed below, it is aviable alternative.2.5.2 MODEL OF EFFECTS OF STARTING DISTANCE ON FLIGHT INITIATION DISTANCE:MONITORING COSTS AND SPONTANEOUS MOVEMENTSTo examine effects of spontaneous movement and monitoring costs on therelationship between SD and FID, Chamaillé-Jammes and Blumstein (2012[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.8]) developed a model that predicts twodistances, the predator–prey distance where spontaneous movement occurs and FIDbased on monitoring cost. Recall that dmin in Blumstein’s (2003[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.3]) model separates zone I where flight isimmediate from zone II where escape decisions are based on costs and benefits.Starting distance might or might not affect economic assessment leading to FIDin zone II. To allow both possibilities, Chamaillé-Jammes and Blumstein (2012[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.8]) assumed that the predator–prey distancewhere monitoring cost elicits escape is proportional to SD. In the equation d* =dmin + βSD, d* is the distance at which prey flee based on monitoring cost and βis the proportionality constant. When β > 0, only spontaneous movement canaffect the relationship between SD and FID.Spontaneous movement was assumed to have a random Poisson distribution with rateλ(s−1), which can also be expressed in m−1. Prey are allowed to movespontaneously when d* < SD. The probability of spontaneous movement increasesexponentially as the distance approached by the predator increases. Thepredicted distance for spontaneous movement is dspon = αeλd, 0 < d* ≤ d ≤ SD,where dspon is the distance where spontaneous movement occurs and α is aproportionality constant. Thus the distance where spontaneous movement ispredicted increases exponentially with distance with exponential rate constantλ.Predicted FID is the longer of the distances predicted separately frommonitoring cost and spontaneous movement. Chamaillé-Jammes and Blumstein (2012[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.8]) applied the model to data from fouravian species. They concluded that analysis using ordinary least squares (OLS)is appropriate only if prey move only in response to a predator’s approach. Inthat case, the slope of the relationship between FID and SD can be testedagainst the null hypothesis that β = 0. This is an important case because inmany studies prey are aware of predators only when an approach begins in zoneII. During my extensive field work with lizards, I have the impression thatspontaneous movements of many prey are suppressed while monitoring, presumablyto reduce the likelihood of being detected and attacked due to their own motion.Suppression of movement during approach is supported by the observation thatlizards approached tangentially often flee immediately after passing out of apredator’s field of view (Cooper 1997 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.9]).In such cases, which include most studies of lizards, OLS analyses arejustified.When the spontaneous (natural) leaving rate λ > 0 and FID is variable at eachSD, quantile regression can be used because it permits heterogeneous variancesdue to differing effects of β and λ across SDs. In OLS procedures, the mean FIDis estimated for each value of predator–prey distance. In quantile regression,the value of FID is instead estimated for various quantiles, such as the 10 or20% of individuals with the lowest or highest values of FID at each SD. Thisrequires a large data set.For four species of birds with sufficient data using the lowest quantiles (e.g.,5 or 10% of FIDs for a particular predator–prey distance) provided the lowestand best estimates of β. This slope should be 1.0 at distances shorter thandmin, but such distances are excluded from analysis. As λ increases, the slopeapproaches 1.0. By restricting analysis to the lowest quantiles, manyindividuals that move spontaneously are excluded, giving a better estimate ofthe slope of d* on SD based on responses to predators. In two of the four birdspecies for which FID increased as SD increased using all data, FID wasunrelated to SD in quantile regression. When spontaneous movement is frequentand sufficient data are available, quantile regression appears to have greatpromise (Chapter 17 [OEBPS_Text_part0032.xhtml#CN-bp-17]).2.5.3 STARTING DISTANCE, ALERT DISTANCE, AND ECONOMIC ESCAPE2.5.3.1 EFFECTS OF MONITORING PREDATORS ON ESCAPE DECISIONSCooper and Blumstein (2014 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.18]) examinedways in which monitoring might affect FID and proposed novel effects of AD onFID in the context of economic escape theory. Monitoring occurs as part of thescenario in economic escape theory (Ydenberg & Dill 1986[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.52]; Cooper & Frederick 2007a[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.19], 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.21]), but had not been thought to affectpredation risk or cost of fleeing. However, the flush early hypothesis requiresthat increased monitoring cost associated with longer SD (or AD) causes longerFID (Blumstein, 2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.4]; Chamaillé-Jammes &Blumstein 2012 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.8]). This can occur only in alimited range of predator–prey distance. If a prey detects an approachingpredator in the range 0 ≤ d ≤ d*, economic escape models predict that it shouldflee immediately. No opportunity exists for dynamic adjustment of FID based onAD at these short distances; AD and related effects of monitoring the predatorcan affect FID only in zone II where d* < d max.The effect of monitoring on spontaneous movement can influence the degree towhich spontaneous movement affects FID. If movement by the prey increases thelikelihood that the predator will attack, spontaneous movements may besuppressed during monitoring. In that case, spontaneous movements occur and thenatural rate of leaving, λ, is applicable only for long starting distances inzone III where d > dmax. Spontaneous movement in zone III does not affectestimates of FID in zone II where prey make economic escape decisions.Spontaneous movement occurs in the entire interval between the SD and FID in themodel of Chamaillé-Jammes and Blumstein (2012[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.8]). When this is so, spontaneous movementinflates estimates of FID and methods of removing its effect on FID would bevaluable.Monitoring might affect escape decisions in the cost–benefit escape models viacosts of not fleeing and costs of fleeing. The cost of not fleeing is primarilya consequence of predation risk, and increases as the predator comes closer;cost of fleeing is primarily opportunity cost, and increases as FID increasesbecause the prey has less time to complete beneficial activities. Effects ofmonitoring may be complex, affecting costs of fleeing, not fleeing or both, buthave not been studied empirically. Cooper and Blumstein (2014[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.18]) identified several ways related to SDthat monitoring might influence FID. Any combination of the newly identifiedeffects might contribute to flushing early.2.5.3.1.1 COST OF NOT FLEEINGThe physiological cost of monitoring is the energy expended to monitor thepredator, presumably via neurological and sensory processes, that is over andabove the energy that would be expended in the absence of monitoring. Thephysiological cost is greater when FID is shorter because the predator has beenmonitored for a longer time and over a longer distance. Although potentiallymeasurable, it is presumably very small. The total cost of not fleeing isobtained by adding physiological cost to cost due to predation risk (Figure 2.9[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#FIGm-fig-10]). Because physiological cost is verysmall, it can be omitted in empirical studies unless there is reason to believethat it differs among experimental treatments.[OEBPS_Images_image00905.jpeg]Figure 2.9Upon detecting an approaching predator at the alert distance, AD, the preybegins to monitor it. The physiological cost of monitoring increases as theduration and distance of approach increase. The sum of this physiological costof monitoring and the cost due to predation risk is the total cost of notfleeing. The predicted FID, d*, occurs at the intersection of the total cost ofnot fleeing and cost of fleeing curves. The effect of physiological cost ofmonitoring is to increase d*.From Cooper and Blumstein (2014 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.18])The other effect is a dynamic increase in assessed risk as the duration andlength of the predator’s approach increase, leading to assessment of greaterrisk than that attributable to predator–prey distance alone. This effect wouldlead to increase in FID as AD increases. Prey adjust assessed risk rapidly anddynamically to changes in the behavior of approaching predators (Cooper 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.11]). As the duration of approach increases,the probability that the predator has detected or will soon detect the prey andwill attack increases. Effective risk assessments must account for increasedduration/distance approached, which would lead to increase in FID as ADincreases.Alert distance, which affects distance or duration approached, is very likely animportant predation risk factor. Alert distance sets limits on the maximum FIDand duration of approach during risk assessment. The length of approach and,therefore, assessed risk at any given predator–prey distance increase as ADincreases. If duration of monitoring does not affect assessed risk, risk is onthe same cost of not fleeing curve for all ADs (Figure 2.10[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#FIGm-fig-11]).[OEBPS_Images_image00906.jpeg]Figure 2.10The predicted FID, d*, does not vary with alert distance, AD, if the ADs lie onthe same cost of not fleeing curve. This would occur if ongoing monitoring doesnot affect perception of risk dynamically. By projecting the dotted linesvertically from AD1 and AD2 to the cost of fleeing line, it becomes apparentthat AD does not affect cost of fleeing when there is a single cost of fleeingcurve. This could occur if there is no cumulative cost of monitoring in additionto that incorporated in the cost of fleeing curve.From Cooper and Blumstein (2014 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.18])A curve representing the case in which assessed risk increases with increase induration of monitoring lies above the curve for no monitoring cost when 0 < d <AD (Figure 2.11a [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#FIGm-fig-12]). Both curves haveidentical values at AD where assessment begins and at d = 0, where the cost ofnot fleeing is the expected loss of fitness upon contact with the predator. Ifthe lower curve is linear, the higher risk curve is concave downward (Figure2.11a [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#FIGm-fig-12]). The predicted FIDs are d*N whenduration of approach does not influence assessed risk and d*R when it does. Theintersection of the cost of not fleeing and cost of fleeing curves occurs at alonger predator–prey distance when assessed risk increases as duration ofapproach increases than when duration of approach does not affect assessed risk,i.e., d*R> d*N. If assessed risk increases as duration of approach increases andAD differs, the curve for the longer AD, AD2, is above the curve for the shorterAD1 at all d > 0 (Figure 2.11b [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#FIGm-fig-12]). Inconclusion, when AD affects assessed risk, FID increases as AD increases.[OEBPS_Images_image00907.jpeg]Figure 2.11In both panels, let a line show the cost of not fleeing when theduration/distance that the predator approaches does not alter the prey’sassessed risk. (A) The upper curve portrays an increase in assessed risk to itsmaximum at d = 0. For the upper curve, the assessed risk is greater than that inthe cost of not fleeing line because the prey assess increasing predation riskas the duration/length of approach increases. The predicted FID, for a prey thatthat assesses increasing risk as the duration/distance approached increases,d*R, is longer than the predicted FID if alert distance, AD, does not affectassessed risk, d*N. (B) If assessed risk increases as AD increases, assessedrisk is greater and the predicted FID is longer for the longer of two ADs.From Cooper and Blumstein (2014 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.18])2.5.3.1.2 COST OF FLEEINGAlert distance might be related to opportunity cost of fleeing in several ways,especially if monitoring entails complete or partial reduction offitness-enhancing activities. In certain conditions, monitoring does not affectability to obtain other benefits. For example, basking lizards that have bodytemperatures too low for efficient locomotion may not feed or engage in socialactivities. In such cases, FID will not be affected by a monitoring costassociated with a cost of fleeing. This case can be represented by a single costof fleeing curve with two ADs (Figure 2.10[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#FIGm-fig-11]). Because opportunity cost increases asd increases, it is greater at the longer AD. However, the predicted FID is thesame for both ADs because they lie on the same cost of fleeing curve (Figure2.10 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#FIGm-fig-11]). This relationship holds for preythat do not flush early because of the monitoring cost of fleeing.While monitoring predators, prey may not be able to devote sufficient attentionto efficiently detect their own cryptic prey (Dukas & Kamil 2000[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.31]). Suppose that prey have an attentionalcost of monitoring and the cost of fleeing curves for prey that do and do nothave impaired ability begin at d = 0 and have identical values at AD (Figure2.12a [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#FIGm-fig-13]). The curve for a prey incurringno monitoring cost of fleeing is the highest of a family of such curves. For anytwo cost of fleeing curves, the curve will be lower for a prey incurring greatermonitoring cost. Consequently, for a fixed alert distance, the predicted FID islonger for the curve with greater monitoring costs (Figure 2.12a[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#FIGm-fig-13]). The cost of fleeing curve is loweredprogressively as the degree of impairment of ability to obtain benefits whilemonitoring increases.[OEBPS_Images_image00908.jpeg]Figure 2.12(A) Reduced rate of obtaining benefits while monitoring lowers the cost offleeing and therefore increases FID. This plot shows an upper opportunity costof fleeing line for a prey that incurs no monitoring cost and a lower curve. Inthe upper line the opportunity cost is OC0 at d = 0 and OCAD at AD. Monitoringcost is zero for both curves at the origin and at the alert distance (AD), butgreater for the lower curve at all distances between them, which lowersopportunity cost of fleeing. In this case the cost of monitoring increases asthe predator approaches, but its effect is diminished as benefits remaining tobe obtained shrink as predator–prey distance decreases. The predicted FID isshorter for the upper line representing no monitoring cost (d*N) than for thecurve in which monitoring impairs ability to obtain benefits (d*C). (B) For twoalert distances lying along the line for which monitoring costs do not affectcost of fleeing, let monitoring cost increase at the same rate as duration ofapproach increases. The cost of fleeing discounted for monitoring cost andadjusted for decrease in remaining benefits as the predator approaches is shownas curves through the origin to two alert distances. The curve for the longeralert distance is always lower than that of the shorter alert distance in theinterval 0 < d ≤ AD1, the shorter alert distance. Therefore d* is greater forthe longer alert distance. Confirmation of this effect of monitoring on cost offleeing would strongly support the flush early hypothesis.From Cooper and Blumstein (2014 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.18])Monitoring cost begins at AD when the prey becomes aware of a threat. At thispoint, the opportunity cost OCAD is equal for any two curves because no cost ofmonitoring has accumulated. The cumulative monitoring cost can be calculated byintegrating the difference in cost of fleeing between a curve for no monitoringcost and a lower curve for prey having reduced ability to obtain benefits whilemonitoring between AD and FID. Opportunity cost for all curves at d = 0 is OC0 =0. Because benefits remaining to be obtained by a prey suffering monitoring costdecrease as predator–prey distance decreases, the total cost of fleeing at agiven predator–prey distance is reduced as d decreases, whereas the accumulatedcost of monitoring continues to increase. The difference between the two costcurves is progressively reduced toward the origin to account for decline inremaining benefits.In the same scenario, let two cost of fleeing curves for prey that incurmonitoring costs start at different ADs and intersect the cost of fleeing curvefor a prey that has no attentional monitoring cost at their respective ADs(Figure 2.12b [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#FIGm-fig-13]). The curve having thelonger alert distance is always lower than the curve for the shorter alertdistance if monitoring cost accumulates at the same rate during the predator’sapproach. Therefore the predicted FID is longer for the curve with longer AD(Figure 2.12b [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#FIGm-fig-13]). Demonstrating theeffects of monitoring and alert distance depicted in Figure 2.12[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#FIGm-fig-13] would provide strong support for theflush early hypothesis.2.5.3.2 SPONTANEOUS MOVEMENTSuppression of spontaneous movement during monitoring would eliminate its effectbetween AD and FID, but at SD > AD, spontaneous movement increases estimatedFID. If prey move spontaneously even while monitoring, empirical estimates ofFID will be inflated relative to the economically determined value. The extentof inflation is determined by the natural leaving rate, λ. Using an exponentialfunction as in Chamaillé-Jammes and Blumstein (2012[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.8]), the proportion of individuals thatleave spontaneously between SD and d is 1 – e−λ(SD − d), λ ≥ 0. The estimatedFID overestimates the economically based d* by an increasing distance as λincreases and the difference between SD and d* increases. Nevertheless, if AD isheld constant in a single population, spontaneous movement does not affectordinal level predictions of FID for cost of not fleeing and cost of fleeingfactors. At the longest observed FID, monitoring costs accumulated duringapproach are the same for prey that flee and do not flee. Therefore d* must begreater for the prey that flee. The same applies in succession at shorterobserved FIDs. In comparative studies, though, differences in λ among speciesmight lead to misinterpretation of findings.For a prey that has not detected an approaching predator in zone II or III,spontaneous movements occur, but no monitoring costs are incurred before theprey is aware of the predator. For prey that detect the predator at AD,spontaneous movement might continue as monitoring cost is incurred before thepredator reaches the economically predicted FID. A major advantage of using ADinstead of SD is that spontaneous movements while the prey is not assessingrisks and costs are excluded.Several methods might be used to estimate an economically based FID from rawdata that include effects of spontaneous movement. The only method employed todate is discussed in Chapter 16 [OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#CN-bp-16]. Otherpossible methods are suggested here. For normally distributed FID, the highestfrequency should occur at d*. The highest frequency should also identify d* ifthe distribution is skewed to the right as long as the rate of spontaneousmovement is not so high that few prey remain when the predator reaches d*. Forvalues of λ that do not drastically deplete prey before the predator reaches d*,the modal FID is presumably d*.Another method of estimating d* excludes all data for long distances. When d <d*, spontaneous movement does not occur because prey flee immediately, yieldinga slope of FID on SD of 1.0. The value of d* can be estimated as the maximumdistance for which the slope of FID on SD is 1.0. Although using this methodavoids adjustment for spontaneous movement, it would be preferable to estimated* from data that include spontaneous movements.Two other methods use data for distances > d*. If the natural rate of leaving isknown, the expected proportion of individuals that move spontaneously in eachdistance interval can be calculated using the exponential relationship presentedabove. This requires field research to determine whether rates of spontaneousmovement are constant across distances, and if so, to estimate λ. Given λ, theexpected numbers of individuals that left spontaneously is calculated fordistance intervals in which prey do not always flee immediately. Data for thenumbers of individuals expected to move spontaneously could then be removedrandom from each distance interval. The mean FID for the remaining data is anestimate of d*.A different method of estimating d* is to compare expected proportions ofindividuals that leave by spontaneous movements with the total proportions thatleave in each interval. The longest interval in which the observed proportionthat left exceeds the expected proportion to the greatest degree contains d*. Inintervals shorter than d*, immediate movement occurs for all individuals, butthis is irrelevant in 0 ≤ d < d*.2.5.3.3 RAPID ADVANCES IN UNDERSTANDING EFFECTS OF STARTING DISTANCEIn the short time since Blumstein (2003 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.3])reported the effect on SD on FID, SD and AD have been studied intensively. Thecauses, relationship to economic escape theory, and the effects of spontaneousmovement have all been examined theoretically and empirically. Research onrelationships among SD, AD, and FID has led to rapid progress in ourunderstanding of these phenomena through the combined theoretical and empiricalstudies of several behavioral ecologists.We now understand the basic underlying causes for effects of SD and AD on FIDtheoretically, but much remains to be discovered, especially about the possibleeffects of monitoring discussed here on cost of fleeing and on assessedpredation risk, and their relationships to flushing early. Research is needed togauge the importance of all of these potential costs, any or all of which mayoccur in some prey. Rates of spontaneous movement, their variation withpredator–prey distance, and the magnitude of their effect on FID are importanttopics for future empirical research.2.6 OTHER APPROACHES TO MODELING ESCAPE DECISIONS AND REFUGE USE2.6.1 EFFECT OF DIRECTION OF APPROACH BY PREDATOR ON FLIGHT DECISIONS FOR ESCAPETO A FIXED REFUGEPrey often have options to select among multiple refuges, but in somecircumstances only a single refuge is available. There might be only one burrow,tree, or crevice close enough for the prey to reach before being overtaken by apredator. In such cases the direction from which a predator approaches has astrong influence on the risk of being killed if the escape attempt begins at afixed distance. If the prey is on a line connecting an approaching predator andthe refuge, and is located between the predator and the refuge, it can fleedirectly away from the predator to the refuge (Figure 2.13a[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#FIGm-fig-14]). If the prey is on the same line, butthe refuge lies between it and the predator, the prey must flee toward thepredator to reach the refuge.[OEBPS_Images_image00909.jpeg]Figure 2.13Flight initiation distance is shorter when a prey can flee directly away from apredator to a refuge than when it must flee toward a predator t reach refuge.(A)When the prey is between the predator and a refuge and its distance to refugeis DP, its expected FID, FIDexp, is the distance at which predator and prey areexpected to reach the refuge simultaneously, ADcrit, plus the a margin ofsafety, MOS. When the refuge is between the predator and prey and DP and ADcritare the same as in the previous case, FIDexp must be longer to reach the refugewith the same MOS. For a predator on the same side of the refuge as the prey,FIDexp = ADcrit + MOS – DP; for a predator on the opposite side of the refuge,FIDexp = ADcrit + MOS + DP. (B)The slopes of FIDexp on distance to refuge forpredators approaching from the same (solid line) and opposite (dashed line) sideof the refuge are shown for MOS = 8 and a predator 1.5 times faster than theprey.From Kramer and Bonenfant (1997 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.35])Kramer and Bonenfant (1997 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.35]) modeled theeffect of the direction of approach in this situation. They assumed that forboth directions, there is a critical predator–prey distance, ADcrit, at which apredator approaching at a fixed speed will reach the refuge at the same time asthe fleeing prey. ADcrit stands for critical approach distance, where approachdistance is a synonym of FID, and is not to be confused with alert distance.Kramer and Bonenfant (1997 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.35]) also assumedthat prey flee before the predator reaches ADcrit to allow the prey a margin ofsafety in arrival at the refuge before the predator. In the model, the margin ofsafety (MOS) is a fixed distance that, when added to ADcrit, gives the predictedFID.If the prey is between the predator and the refuge, the predicted FID, d*, isADcrit + MOS – DP, where DP is the distance between the prey and its refuge(Figure 2.13a [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#FIGm-fig-14]). If the predator is onthe far side of the refuge, the prey must flee toward the predator, requiring alonger FID for equal ADcrit and MOS. The expected FID in this case is d* =ADcrit + MOS + DP (Figure 2.13a [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#FIGm-fig-14]). Valuesof d* vary with distance to refuge, the ratio of predator to prey velocity, andwhether the prey is on the same or opposite side of the refuge (Figure 2.13a[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#FIGm-fig-14]). Let AV be the velocity of the attackerand PV be the velocity of the prey. Then ADcrit = DP(AV/PV). The slope of theline in Figure 2.13b [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#FIGm-fig-14] when the predatorand prey are on the same side of the refuge (Figure 2.13b[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#FIGm-fig-14]) is (AV/PV) − 1, whereas the slope whenboth the prey and predator are on opposite sides of the refuge is (AV/PV) + 1.These values permit the prediction that these slopes differ by 2.0 slope units.In the only test of this prediction to date, the difference was 1.78 forwoodchucks (Marmota monax), which did not differ significantly from 2.0 (Kramer& Bonenfant 1997 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.35]).This model complements the cost–benefit model of escape by being mechanistic. Itapplies only to the risk factors distance to refuge, relative velocities of thepredator and prey, and the time/distance until the predator overtakes the prey.Nonetheless, the model makes the same general predictions as economic models(i.e., FID is longer when risk is greater in all three cases). No explicit MOSappears in current economic models, but one must exist for prey to escapecontact with predators. Kramer and Bonenfant (1997[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.35]) did not consider effects of cost offleeing, but cost of fleeing can be considered to be nearly constant in theabsence of social interaction and unusual opportunities by hungry prey to eatscarce food.The model is remarkable for making predictions solely from readily measuredvariables, in contrast to economic models that make predictions based on fitnesscomponents that are extremely difficult to determine and in practice are notknown above an ordinal scale. Further testing is required to determine whetheran MOS is constant for a given predator/prey velocity ratio and for approachesfrom the same and opposite sides. Further testing is also required to determinewhether the prediction of the difference of 2.0 slope units applies to otherspecies. Other possibilities, not yet explicitly treated by this or othermodels, are that prey escape velocities differ when approaching or fleeing awayfrom a predator, and that escape velocities are dynamically adjusted to changesin predator speed.2.6.2 GAME-THEORETICAL MODEL OF ESCAPE DECISIONS BY CRYPTIC PREYWhen a cryptic prey is approached by a predator, general economic models of FIDtreat crypsis as a predation risk factor that affects the cost of not fleeing.The more effective the crypsis, the shorter is the predicted FID. Broom andRuxton (2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.6]) developed agame-theoretical model that applies specifically to the effect of crypsis onFID. Here, the model’s rationale will be discussed; its many equations andparameters can be consulted in the original article.In the model the prey is aware of the predator before the predator detects theprey, but as the predator draws nearer, its probability of detecting the preyincreases. The likelihood of being captured for the prey increases as thepredator–prey distance where the predator detects the prey decreases. Thisscenario differs slightly from that of the Ydenberg and Dill (1986[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.52]) and optimal escape (Cooper & Frederick2007a [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.19], 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.21]) models. In those models the effect ofdecreasing predator–prey distance includes both the increase in probability ofbeing detected and of being caught if attacked, and also allows the predator tohave detected the prey before the prey has detected it. However, for a verycryptic prey that has been immobile, it is likely that the prey will detect thepredator first.If the prey flees before it has been detected, it may escape without beingdetected or its movement may draw the predator’s attention, eliciting an attack.If the prey does not flee when it first detects the predator, but relies oncrypsis to avoid being detected and attacked, the risk of being detected islower than if it flees, but the risk of being captured if detected is greaterwhen the predator is closer upon detecting the prey.The game-theoretical model includes trajectories and speeds not explicitlystated in the other models and allows consideration of the effect of the prey’sbehavior on the predator’s attack strategy. Broom and Ruxton (2005[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.6]) considered cases in which a predator haspassed the prey and can either still see the prey or not and can approach beforeattacking. Only the case in which the predator is approaching on a straight lineand must attack as soon as it detects the prey is describe here.The game matrix (Table 2.2 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#TBLm-tblw-2]) includesthree possibilities and their payoffs. If no chase occurs, the prey’s payoff is1 and the predator’s payoff is 0. If fleeing is elicited by attack, the payoffsdepend on the predator–prey distance when attack begins, d, the cost of fleeing,c, and the probability of capture when the predator initiates the attack fromdistance d, f(d), when the predator is at point v on its trajectory. The prey’spayoff is the product of (1 – c) and (1 – f[d(v)]. The predator’s payoff isf[d(v)]. If the prey begins to flee before it is attacked, it gains an advantagein distance covered, Δ, due to the delay in reactive attack by the predator.Therefore when escape is initiated before the predator attacks, the payoffs are(1 – c)(1 – f[d(v) + Δ] for the prey and f[d(v) + Δ] for the predator. Thesituation in the crypsis model in which delayed escape occurs only when thepredator attacks raises questions about how the prey might distinguish continuedapproach from attack. Prey rapidly adjust FID to changes in speed and directnessof approach by predators (Cooper 1997 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.9],1998 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.10], 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.12]), providing possible cues to permit theoption of attack-initiated chases for d > 0.Table 2.2 Payoff matrix of Broom and Ruxton’s (2005[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.6]) model of escape by a cryptic prey. Inthe matrix c is the cost of surviving by outrunning the predator, which differsfrom the opportunity cost of fleeing in economic escape models. The probabilitythat the predator captures if the predator initiates the attack from distance dwhen at point v on its trajectory is f[d(v)]. The advantage in distance gainedby the prey by initiating escape before the predator attacks is Δ.SituationPrey’s payoffPredator’s payoffNo chase10Attack-initiated chase(1 – c)(1– f[d(v)])f([d(v)]Fleeing-initiated chase(1 – c)(1 – f[d(v) + Δ]f[d(v) + Δ]The major conclusion of the model is that a cryptic prey should either fleeimmediately when it detects the approaching predator (that is still unaware ofthe prey) or postpone fleeing until the predator attacks. The prey should fleeimmediately when the predator has a low search rate (allowing escape with lowprobability of being detected), cost of escaping by outrunning the predator islow, probability of escaping if the prey initiates escape is greater than if itflees only in response to being detected and attacked, ability to detect thepredator at a distance is low, the predator’s ability to detect the prey isgreater (ineffective crypsis), and capture rate when the predator attacks ishigh. In the opposite conditions, prey should postpone fleeing until attacked.Are the predictions of Broom and Ruxton’s (2005[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.6]) model consistent with those of generaleconomic escape models? In those models prey should flee immediately wheneverthe predator is detected closer than the economically predicted FID. If apredator is highly efficient at capturing the prey if it attacks and is unlikelyto detect a prey fleeing due to low searching rate, fleeing immediately can bepredicted. In the general models, lower cost of fleeing predicts longer FID, butthe cost of fleeing is primarily opportunity cost, which is not considered inBroom and Ruxton’s (2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.6]) model.Nevertheless, if c in their model is considered to represent the sum ofenergetic cost of fleeing, cost of possible injury not inflicted by the predatorwhile fleeing, and opportunity cost, the model is economic. In the generaleconomic models, limited ability to detect the predator increases the likelihoodthat the predator will not be detected before it reaches the economicallypredicted FID, and high ability of the predator to detect the prey correspondsto a low degree of crypsis, which predicts longer FID due to greater risk ofbeing detected and attacked.In the model for cryptic prey, delaying escape attempts until attacked by thepredator is favored by low capture efficiency by the predator, high probabilityof detecting and attacking the prey if it flees, high cost of fleeing if theprey outruns the predator, little or no advantage of initiating escape attemptsrather than reacting to attack, strong ability of the prey to detect thepredator at long distances, and limited ability of the predator to detect theprey at long distances. All of these factors are associated with shorterpredicted FID in the general cost–benefit models through their effects on costof not fleeing and cost of fleeing.The predictions of Broom and Ruxton’s (2005[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.6]) escape model for immediate escape bycryptic prey are consistent with those of Ydenberg and Dill’s (1986[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.52]) and Cooper and Frederick’s (2007a[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.19], 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.21]) cost–benefit models. Thegame-theoretical model includes a subset of the predation risk factors in thosemodels. However, predictions of the model for cryptic prey when flight istriggered by attack differ from those of the more general models. The latterpredict that prey monitor the predator until it closes to an economicallypredicted FID that is typically greater than zero. All of the models allow zeroFID if crypsis is perfect. However, in the general models, the predicted FID mayoccur before or after the predator has detected the prey, depending on riskdetermined jointly by probability of being detected and attacked if detected,and by the predator’s capture efficiency and lethality upon capture. Empiricalstudies of highly cryptic frogs and lizards (Cooper et al. 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.28]; Cooper & Sherbrooke 2010a[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.22],b[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.23]) show that some individuals do not fleeuntil overtaken; FID by horned lizards (Phrynosoma cornutum) increased aspredation risk (approach speed and directness of approach) increased when thepredator did not change speed or directness (Cooper & Sherbrooke 2010a[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.22]). These findings support the generalmodels in which FID increases with risk and challenge the crypsis model toidentify a means of determining how prey assess when attack begins in a mannerconsistent with the data.2.6.3 GAME-THEORETICAL APPROACH TO HIDING TIME IN REFUGEWhen a prey flees into a refuge, it may gain safety, but lose information aboutthe predator’s location. A waiting game ensues in which the predator decideswhether to stay in the area or seek other prey and the prey decides when toemerge. Emerging too soon may be disastrous for the prey, and waiting too longmay be costly to the predator. Due to large differences in fitness consequencesfor predator and prey, prey are expected to win the waiting game by staying inrefuge until after the predator has left the area (Hugie 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.34]).Hugie’s (2003 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.34]) model establishes theexistence of an evolutionarily stable strategy of waiting times for predator andprey, the prey’s waiting time being hiding time. The predator’s distribution ofwaiting times before leaving should resemble a negative exponentialdistribution, whereas prey should have more variable hiding times and apositively skewed distribution. The model predicts that predators will onlyrarely outwait prey. The model does not permit predictions about the economicbases of latency to emerge from refuge, but does provides valuable insight intothe process leading to successful refuge use.2.6.4 STOCHASTIC DYNAMIC MODELING OF FITNESS CONSEQUENCES OF HIDING TIME INREFUGEStochastic dynamic modeling is a technique used to calculate the fitness ofanimals over some interval of time in which they have made various behavioraldecisions (Mangel & Clark 1993 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.40]), butthis useful method of modeling has been applied to decisions about escape andrefuge use only once. Rhoades and Blumstein (2007[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.45]) conducted an empirical study of hidingtime and modeled its consequences over the activity season in yellow-belliedmarmots (Marmota flaviventris) that must gain sufficient body mass beforeentering hibernation in order to survive over winter.The empirical study showed that marmots hide for longer times when approachedslowly than rapidly, presumably because their most dangerous predators that staylonger in the vicinity when marmots enter refuge are stalking predators thatsearch specifically for marmots. Hiding time decreased when food was placedoutside the burrow. However, the effects of approach speed and added foodinteracted, being shortest when extra food was present after less riskyapproaches.In the model, the ability of marmots to meet their energetic needs is improved,but predation risk is increased, by shorter hiding times. Daily weight gain bydifferent age/sex groups and their asymptotic weights were used to calculateweight upon entering hibernation and daily energetic needs during the activityseason. The probability of being killed was considered to be proportional to theamount of time spent outside refuge in each step (90 minute time interval). Aproportionality constant, r representing the predation rate in the populationwas multiplied by the proportion of time in the open to give the probability ofpredation P = r(t0/t), where to represent time in the open at each step. In themodel runs, r was varied between 10 and 50% for the activity season.Because marmots do not gain energy while in refuge, the amount acquired duringeach step (i.e., the gain) is g(x) = [kn(t0/t)2], where k is a proportionalityconstant that was higher when extra food was present and n is units of need.Benefits for prey that emerge early from refuge are elevated by squaring theproportion of time outside refuge to account for high gain by early emergers andloss of the extra food to other group members by late emergers. The netenergetic gain G(x) = g(x) – c, where c is the energetic cost (expenditure) inthe step. Nine discrete levels of body condition of marmots ranged from 0 (dead)to 8 (able to hibernate without starving to death). Fitness of a marmot at thefinal step was represented by a sigmoidal function, T (fit) = s2/(4 + s2), wheres is the condition.The model calculated the optimal hiding decisions for an individual over a givennumber of time steps. To examine effects of suboptimal hiding times on fitness,(1) predation was randomized to permit predation even on prey making optimaldecisions and (2) populations of 100 marmots were simulated that used hidingtimes that were optimal, 50% of optimal, and 200% of optimal.The consequence of shortened hiding time was drastic: all individuals werekilled by predators. Individuals that hid too long lost condition over time,resulting in high mortality (c. 64 to 92%). Survival by prey making optimaldecisions was 100% despite inclusion of randomized predation in the model. Thusthe stochastic dynamic model highlights the crucial nature of making optimaldecisions about hiding, decisions that balance the effects of predation riskagainst long-term energetic needs. The model revealed differences among age/sexgroups in relative hiding times among combinations of approach speed andprovision of extra food (or not). The rankings of hiding time for thesecombinations varied with body conditions both within and among age/sex groups(Rhoades & Blumstein 2007 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.45]). The modelwas highly successful in identifying fitness consequences of suboptimal hidingtimes and revealed subtle variation among age/sex groups and states of bodycondition that correspond to testable predictions. Stochastic dynamic modelingshows great promise and could readily be applied to trade-offs between hidingtime and reproductive and aggressive behaviors and to assessing fitnessconsequences of suboptimal escape decisions, especially about FID.2.7 BEHAVIORS PRIOR TO FLEEING AND FLIGHT INITIATION DISTANCE: VIGILANCE, ALARMCALLING, AND PURSUIT-DETERRENT SIGNALINGSeveral behaviors that may affect escape decisions are omitted or treated inless detail in this chapter, which is devoted to models of escape behavior andrefuge use in which prey base decisions on economic considerations and toclosely allied models. Vigilance, alarm calling, and pursuit-deterrent signalingare among these behaviors that occur prior to escape. They are considered heretheoretically and discussed more comprehensively in Chapter 10[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#CN-bp-10]. Vigilance affects escape decisions becauseless vigilant prey may permit predators to approach closer than more vigilantprey would before fleeing. In such cases, more vigilant individuals begin toescape at the longest predator–prey distance where cost of not fleeing outweighsthe cost of fleeing. Less vigilant prey may fail to detect the predator until itis closer than the economically predicted distance where escape should begin.In terms of escape theory, vigilant prey may detect an approaching predator inzone II, in which case it flees when the predator reaches the economicallypredicted FID, or in zone I, where immediate escape is predicted. A lessvigilant prey may not detect the predator until it penetrates zone I, later thanwould occur for a more vigilant prey. Therefore FID is shorter for the lessvigilant of two prey in zone I. Furthermore, predation risk is greater upondetection of a predator for the less vigilant prey. Not allocating time tovigilance can be catastrophic for a prey if it fails to detect the predatoruntil captured. Even if a less vigilant prey flees when it detects a predatorthat is already close or that flees upon detecting a fleeing conspecific, theincrease in risk compared to that for a more vigilant prey can be substantial(Lima 1994 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.37]).Many prey signal that they have detected a predator and are able to escape ifattacked, or at least more able to escape than non-signaling prey. Nur andHasson (1984 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.43]) considered pursuitdeterrence to be a case of the handicap principle (Zahavi 1975[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.53]), which states that some traits thatappear to be deleterious have evolved because they demonstrate that the bearercan overcome the handicap, which therefore indicates its superior fitness.Signaling to a predator might be considered a handicap that increases thelikelihood of the signaler being detected and attacked. Nur and Hasson (1984[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.43]) showed that if a signaler has a higherprobability of escaping if attacked than nearby conspecifics, a predator shouldpreferentially attack non-signalers. In Nur and Hasson’s (1984[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.43]) model and in other models unless statedotherwise, prey are aware that a predator is present and direct the signal tothat predator.Game theory is applicable to pursuit deterrence because the fitness consequencesfor the prey are affected by the predator’s decision to attack or not and thepredator’s success depends on the relative escape ability of prey that signaland do not signal. Vega-Redondo and Hasson (1993[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.51]) employed a game-theoretical approach tomodel a predator choosing which prey to attack from a herd. The herd includesindividuals that have variable signal strength and non-signalers. The prey varyin ability to escape if attacked, which is honestly indicated by signalstrength. The predator’s choice also is affected by the frequencies of prey withhigh and low escape ability that is correlated signal strength. Given theseconditions, an equilibrium favorable to both predator and prey exists, in partbecause a cheater whose signal indicates greater escape ability than itpossesses is likely to be captured if attacked, which occurs at some probabilitygreater than zero. At equilibrium, strong signalers are less likely to beattacked and predators gain attacking weaker signalers. The probability ofsuccessful cheating increases as herd size increases and the frequency ofhigh-quality prey decreases, which affects the equilibrium probabilities ofsignaling and attacking.Alarm calling by prey that detect predators may evolve by kin selection even ifcalling increases the chances of being detected and attacked. Signaling may alsohave a pursuit-deterrent function if the signaler is likely to escape because itis aware of the predator. In a game-theoretical model of alarm calling calledthe watchful babbler game (Bergstrom & Lachman 2001[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.2]), the payoff matrix has separate entrieswhen a predator is present and absent and, when a predator is present, separateentries for prey that do and do not signal (Table 2.3[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#TBLm-tblw-3]). When a predator is absent, uncertainprey may signal with payoff 1 – c, where c is the prey’s cost of signaling. Ifthe prey does not signal, its payoff is one. In both cases the payoff for thepredator is 0. If a predator is present and the prey signals, the prey’s payoffis (1 – c)(1 – t), where t is the probability of being captured if the predatorattacks. The predator’s payoff in this situation is t – d, where d is the costto the predator of attacking. If the prey signals, but the predator does notattack, the prey’s payoff is 1 – c and the predator’s is zero. When the preydoes not signal and the predator attacks, the payoff is 1 – t for the prey and t– d for the predator. Finally, if the prey does not signal when a predator ispresent but fails to attack, the prey’s payoff is 1 and the predator’s payoff is0. The predator’s maximum possible payoff in this model is the same for prey andpredator.Table 2.3 Payoff matrix of the watchful babbler game in which the prey cansignal or not in the presence or absence of a predator and the predator canattack or not whether the prey signals or not. The prey’s payoff is 1, itscurrent fitness, if it does not signal and is not attacked. The predator’spayoff is 0 if it does not attack and t – d if it attacks, where t is theprobability of capturing the prey that it attacks and d is the cost ofattacking. The maximum payoff for the predator is the prey’s fitness and canonly be achieved if capture is certain and attack carries no cost.Predator presentSignalNo signalPredator absentChaseNo chaseChaseNo chaseSignalNosignalPrey(1 – c) (1 – t)1 – c1 – t11 – c1Predatort – d0t – d000Modified from Table 1 in Bergstrom and Lachmann (2001)A key feature of this model is that the prey is uncertain whether a predator ispresent or not, and is more likely to signal when it assesses the probability ofa predator being present to be higher. The model predicts that calls may notonly inform conspecifics about the presence of a predator, but also honestlyinform the predator that it has been detected and that the signaler is thereforemore likely to escape if attacked. The signal does not indicate that signalershave greater physiological escape ability, only that they are aware. InBergstrom and Lachmann’s (2001 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.2]) model,the cost of signaling is a consequence of alerting predators other than the oneto which the prey is responding to the prey’s presence. The watchful babblergame has a stable equilibrium at which predators are less likely to attack whenprey signal. At equilibrium, prey benefit by being less likely to be attackedand killed, whereas predators benefit by not incurring cost of attacking whenthe probability of capture is too low.An unpublished game-theoretical model by W. Cooper and W. Frederick examineseffects of a predator on prey’s decision to signal and of a solitary prey on thepredator’s decision to attack. The model makes four assumptions. First, signalstrength does not vary. Second, the probability that a prey that has signaledwill be killed if the predator attacks, Ks, is lower than that for a prey thatdoes not signal, Kns. Thus signaling is honest (Kns – Ks > 0). If the term Kns –Ks is zero, signaling is not beneficial to predator or prey. Third, units in thepayoff matrix are fitnesses for predator and prey normalized to 1. Fourth, thecost of signaling for the prey, Cs, is very small compared to the benefit of akill for the predator, B (i.e., Cs << Bk). In effect, the benefit of the kill isunaffected by the signaling cost to the prey.The game matrix (Table 2.4 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#TBLm-tblw-4]) excludes thecase in which no predator is present that was in the payoff matrix of thewatchful babbler game (Table 2.3 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#TBLm-tblw-3]). Themodel assumes that the predator has been detected with certainty. The optimalsignaling strategy for the prey depends on the probability that the predatorwill attack, and the optimal attack strategy by the predator depends on theprobability that the prey signals. Thus the equilibrium strategies in thepursuit deterrence game are determined by mutual influences of predator andprey. The model is derived in ESM 2.1, which is available atwww.cambridge.org/9781107060548 [http://www.cambridge.org/9781107060548].Table 2.4 Payoff matrix of a game-theoretical model of pursuit deterrence forsolitary prey that are certain that a predator is present. The predator attackswith probability p and does not attack with probability 1 – p. The prey signalswith probability q and does not signal with probability 1 – q. For eachcombination of predator and prey actions, the payoff for the predator is shownfirst, separated by a comma from the payoff for the prey. B – the predator’sbenefit from killing the prey, Ca – the predator’ cost of attacking, Cs – theprey’s cost of signaling, Ks – the probability of killing a prey that hassignaled if the predator attacks, Kns – the probability of killing a prey thathas not signaled if the predator attacks.PreySignal (q)Not signal (1 – q)PredatorAttack (p)(BKs – Ca, 1 – Ks – Cs)(BKns –Ca, 1 – Kns)Not attack (1 – p)(0, 1 – Cs)(0, 1)(Cooper & Frederick, unpublished)Pursuit-deterrent signaling is relevant to escape decisions if signaling lowersthe probability of being attacked and, therefore, predation risk. The models ofpursuit deterrence show that honest signals that communicate the prey’slikelihood of escaping when aware of the predator lead to a stable equilibriumof signaling and attack with reduced probability of attack on signalers. Thereduced risk associated with signaling predicts that a prey should allow apredator to approach closer before fleeing when the prey signals than when itdoes not. This prediction was confirmed in the zebra-tailed lizard, Callisaurusdraconoides, that lizards that signaled allowed predators to approach closerbefore they fled than did non-signaling individuals (Cooper 2011b[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.17]).2.8 ESCAPE LATENCYThe models considered thus far predict FID by an immobile prey being approachedby a predator and hiding time in refuge when a predator was known to be nearbyupon refuge entry. Two recent graphical models (Martín et al. 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.42]; Cooper et al. 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.30]) predict latency to flee by an immobileprey near an immobile predator. The former model is limited to predictions abouteffects of risk factors on escape latency. The latter model applies to predationrisk factors and opportunity costs and is similar to the Ydenberg and Dill modelof FID when a predator moves toward an immobile prey.The escape latency model applies when a prey has moved toward an immobilepredator before stopping or a predator has moved toward an immobile prey beforestopping. If the prey has not detected the predator while approaching it orwhile the predator has approached the prey, the standing distance may be shorterthan the economically predicted FID when the prey has monitored the predator’sapproach. Therefore the escape latency model applies to a wide range of standingdistances, the distance between the immobile predator and immobile prey. Becausean immobile prey might approach the predator after a period of immobility, theprey’s latency to approach might also be modeled and measured, but is notconsidered here beyond noting that a prey may assess the immobile predator asposing less risk as time spent immobile increases.The encounter begins when the prey becomes aware that an immobile predator isnearby. Escape latency is the time between initial awareness and initiation ofescape behavior. In the graphical model (Cooper et al. 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.30]; Figure 2.14[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#FIGm-fig-15]) escape latency (time) is the horizontalaxis and the cost of fleeing and cost of remaining immobile (not fleeing) arethe left and right vertical axes, respectively. Cost of fleeing decreases asescape latency increases because the predator is increasingly likely to detectand attack the prey. Cost of immobility increases as time increases becauseopportunity cost increases. The predicted escape latency occurs at theintersection of the increasing cost of remaining immobile and the decreasingcost of fleeing curves.[OEBPS_Images_image00910.jpeg]Figure 2.14When an immobile predator is near an immobile prey, the probability that thepredator will detect and attack the prey increases with time. Therefore the costof fleeing incurred when movement causes the prey to be detected and attackeddecreases as time increases. Cost of remaining immobile increases as timeincreases due to increasing loss of opportunities to enhance fitness thatrequire movement. The predicted latency to flee, t*, occurs at the intersectionof the two cost curves. Escape latency model. From Cooper et al. (2012[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.30]). Predicted latency to flee, t*, islonger for the higher of two cost of fleeing curves. Although not shown, it alsois longer for the lower of two cost of immobility curves intersecting a singlecost of fleeing curve.Cost of fleeing decreases as risk increases. For two costs of fleeing (e.g.those for fast versus slow approach speeds by the predator), the latency toescape is predicted to be greater when predation risk is smaller (cost offleeing is higher).Latency to flee is greater when standing distance is greaterbecause risk is lower at longer standing distance due to longer time required bya predator to detect the prey and lower risk of being captured if attacked. Preyare predicted to move sooner when cost of remaining still is higher, preventingthem from obtaining benefits of feeding, social behavior, or other activitiesthat increase fitness. If expected benefits are large enough relative to risk, aprey animal may not flee, but instead approach the predator to obtain thebenefit or move toward the source of benefit without approaching the predator.In such cases the variable measured is latency to move or latency to approachthe predator, not escape latency.Only a few tests of predictions of the models of escape latency have beenconducted because the models are new; tests are thus far limited to lizards.However, all predictions tested have been verified. Escape latency is affectedby standing distance and many of the predation risk factors known to affect FID.It increases as standing distance increases (six species), predator approachspeed before stopping decreases (three species), directness of approach by thepredator decreases (three species), for the second of two consecutive approaches(two species), and is greater when the predator maintains eye contact with theprey than looks elsewhere (one species) (Martín et al. 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.42]; Cooper et al. 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.30]; Cooper & Sherbrooke 2013b[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.25]). Escape latency decreases whenopportunities to enhance fitness are present. It is shorter in the presence thanabsence of food (two species) or an unfamiliar female that may be courted bymales (one species) (Martín et al. 2009 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.42];Cooper et al. 2012 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.30]; Cooper & Sherbrooke2013b [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.25]). In all cases in which an effecthas been observed in two or more species, two families and both active foragingand ambush foraging modes are represented, hinting that the predictions mayapply to prey from diverse taxa having disparate ecological traits. Moreresearch is needed on additional taxa.2.9 NEW MODEL OF NEAREST APPROACH DISTANCE BY A PREY APPROACHING AN IMMOBILEPREDATORIn a previously unmodeled scenario, a prey approaches an immobile predator thatthe prey has detected (Figure 2.15 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#FIGm-fig-16]). Asin Ydenberg and Dill’s (1986 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.52]) model ofFID, the horizontal axis in the graphical model of nearest approach distance isdistance between prey and predator. Left and right vertical axes are the cost ofapproaching and cost of not approaching, respectively. The cost of approachingdue to predation risk increases as the distance from the predator decreases. Thecost of not approaching, which is primarily an opportunity cost incurred whensome benefit can only be obtained by approaching the predator, increases asdistance from the predator increases. This model applies only to prey that havesensory systems and cognitive abilities that allow them to perceive an immobilepreditor. The model is not applicable to prey that lack these abilities, such assome teiid lizards that often approach and walk on the feet of people who haveremained immobile for some time.[OEBPS_Images_image00911.jpeg]Figure 2.15A prey approaching an immobile predator must balance the increasing cost ofapproaching (risk of predation) as it draws nearer against the cost of notapproaching, which is primarily an opportunity cost. This model is isomorphic toYdenberg and Dill’s (1986 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.52]) model of FID(Figure 1) with cost of approaching substituted for cost of not fleeing and costof not approaching for cost of fleeing.The prey is predicted to stop approaching when the costs of approaching and notapproaching are equal, which occurs at the intersection of the cost curves(Figure 2.15 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#FIGm-fig-16]). This may be accomplishedby becoming immobile or moving in a different direction to avoid coming tooclose. The predictions for two cost of approaching or two cost of notapproaching curves are similar to those of Ydenberg and Dill’s (1986[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.52]) FID model (Figure 2.2[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#FIGm-fig-3]) and Cooper et al.’s (2012[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.30]) latency to flee model (Figure 2.14[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#FIGm-fig-15]). The higher of the two cost ofapproaching curves intersects with a single cost of not approaching curve at agreater distance, indicating that the predicted nearest approach distance islonger when predation risk is greater. The intersection of the higher of twocost of not approaching curves with a single cost of approaching curve is closerto the predator than that of the lower cost of not approaching curve. Thiscomparison shows that the predicted nearest approach distance is shorter forhigher cost of not approaching curves.Mathematical expression of the Ydenberg and Dill (1986[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.52]) model and related graphical modelsvaries with the nature of cost curves. As a first approximation, linear costcurves can be used (Cooper & Frederick 2007a[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.19]). The fitness cost of approaching thepredator until distance d = 0 is the prey’s initial fitness, F0, multiplied bythe predator’s proportional lethality (L), which is LF0. Let the cost ofapproaching be a negative linear function of predator–prey distance, A(d) = LF0– ad, where a > 0 is the slope of the fitness cost of approaching the predatoron distance from the predator. The derivative is A′(d) = – a and is the marginalcost of approaching, which increases from zero where the cost of approachingline intersects the distance axis to LF0 when d = 0. The cost of notapproaching, N(d) is zero at d = 0 and increases linearly as predator–preydistance increases (N(d) = nd, where n > 0 is the slope of the cost of notapproaching on predator–prey distance). The marginal cost of not approaching isN′(d) = n.The prey should continue its approach while the cost of not approaching exceedsthe cost of approaching. If the cost of approaching is greater than or equal tothe cost of not approaching, the prey should stop approaching. The modelpredicts that approach continues until A(d) = N(d), which occurs at thepredicted nearest approach distance, d*. For linear cost of approaching and notapproaching curves, d* = LF0/(n + a).Greater cost of approaching at a particular distance corresponds to a highercost of approaching curve and longer nearest approach distance, implying a lowerabsolute values of the slope a. Suppose that costs are linear and two cost ofapproaching lines have slopes –a and –a^, and a > a^. The difference inpredicted nearest approach distance for the lines that intersect a single costof not approaching line is d*^ – d* = LF0(a – a^)/[(n + a)(n + a^)]. Thedifference a^ – a is positive because a^ < a, corresponding to greater nearestapproach distance for the cost line having the lower slope, a^.The greater of two costs of not approaching at a particular predator–preydistance is associated with the slope n^ > n. For two cost of not approachinglines that intersect a single cost of approaching line, the difference inpredicted nearest approach distances is d*^ – d* = LF0(n – n^)/[(n + a)(n^ + a),where d* is the predicted nearest approach distance for slope a. The nearestapproach distance is shorter for a steeper cost of not approaching line (n^ >n).In the Ydenberg and Dill (1986 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.52]) model ofescape, the cost of not fleeing could be represented by any function thatdecreases monotonically or is non-increasing as predator–prey distanceincreases; similarly any monotonically increasing or non-decreasing functionmight be considered as a possible cost of fleeing curve (Cooper & Vitt 2002[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.26]). Non-linear curves for cost ofapproaching must be described by monotonically decreasing or non-increasingfunctions of distance and those for cost of not approaching must be described bymonotonically increasing or non-decreasing functions of distance.Here, I describe one non-linear cost of approaching. As a prey approaches apredator, risk may increase slowly at long distances from the predator, butaccelerate rapidly near the predator, resulting in a steeper rise in cost ofapproaching when nearing the predator. In such cases the cost of approaching maybe a negative exponential function of distance, A(d) = LF0e−cd, where c is therate constant for exponential decay. The cost of approaching is the expectedfitness if contacted by the predator times the probability of being killed ifthe prey stops approaching at d. If cost of not approaching is linear and costof approaching is negative exponential, the predicted nearest approach distanceis d* = LF0/n – d*/e−cd = d*ecd*. The solution of this equation is d* =ProductLog (cLF0/n)/c, where the function ProductLog(z) in Mathematica is theprincipal solution for w in z = wew. As when both cost functions are linear, d*depends on lethality, initial fitness, and the rate constants for decrease inrisk and increase in cost of not approaching as distance increases. Providedthat risk approaches zero for a negative exponential cost where a linear costreaches the distance axis, risk is lower for the negative exponential cost thanthe linear one at all distances except d = 0. Therefore the cost of approachingcurve intersects the cost of not approaching line closer to the predator (i.e.,nearest approach distance is shorter for the negative exponential than thelinear cost of approaching).An advantage of the model is that it allows many testable predictions to be madefor diverse prey. The model permits a wide range of predictions to be made formany of the risk factors that affect decisions to flee or emerge from refuge inother scenarios. Each of the factors affects the degree of risk incurred byapproaching the predator. Among these are longer nearest approach distance (1)for direct than indirect approach, (2) for prey that encounter predatorsinfrequently than for prey habituated to the presence of potential predatorsthat do not attack, (3) for the second of two approaches if attacked during thefirst approach, (4) for longer than shorter distance to refuge, (5) for longerthan shorter starting distance, (6) for the more conspicuous prey or prey inless concealing cover, (7) for prey with less effective body armor or othereffective defenses, and (8) for slower prey. Predictions are clear for otherrisk factors such as numbers of predators and prey, predator and prey sizes,direction of the predator’s gaze, etc. Among factors affecting the cost of notapproaching, shorter nearest approach distance is predicted for hungry prey inthe presence than absence of food, for reproductively active prey in thepresence than absence of mating opportunities, for thirsty prey in the presencethan absence of water, and for hypoxic prey in a gradient of oxygenconcentration that increases as distance from the predator decreases, and forprey that encounter more favorable thermal conditions nearer the predator.The model’s predictions may be more difficult to test than those of models forthe scenarios discussed above. In the other escape scenarios, the prey isimmobile, permitting a researcher or a model of a predator to approach the preyin various ways that affect risk or to approach to a desired position and thenremain still. Collecting data on nearest approach distance in the field oftenmay require a researcher to move to a location where prey are likely to approachand then remain immobile while waiting to be approached. Because there is noadvantage of a researcher being able to move toward prey, predator models may beused more frequently. Tests of the model could be facilitated by studying highlymobile prey that spend a high proportion of the time moving, such as activeforagers. If approaches by prey are infrequent, data could be accumulated byusing motion-activated video recorders.2.10 RELATIVE MOVEMENT OF PREY AND PREDATOR: ESCAPE VARIABLES AND MODELSEconomic models of decisions about escape, refuge use, and approaching apredator share the perspective that prey adjust antipredatory behavior to bothpredation risk and costs of the antipredatory activities. Risk is traded forbenefit in all of the models. Each model applies to a particular scenariodefined by the movement of both predator and prey, and predicts a behavioralvariable appropriate for the relative movements (Table 2.5[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#TBLm-tblw-5]). The first models described in thischapter were developed to predict FID when a predator approaches an immobilepredator (Ydenberg & Dill 1986 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.52]; Cooper &Frederick 2007a [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.19], 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.21]). More recently models were publishedthat predict escape latency when both predator and prey are immobile (Martín etal. 2009 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.42]; Cooper et al. 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.30]). In the preceding section[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#aid-BE7M9], I presented a model that predicts howclosely a moving prey will approach an immobile predator before stopping orchanging its direction of movement.Table 2.5 Models predicting escape decisions for various scenarios of relativemovement and location of a prey and a single predator.Movement/locationPreyPredatorVariableModelSourcestillmovingFIDgraphicalYdenbergand Dill 1986 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.52]optimalityCooper andFrederick 2007a [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.19], 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.21]stillstilllatency to fleegraphicalMartinet al. 2009 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.41],Cooper et al. 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.30]PALgraphicalthispublicationmovingstillNADgraphicalthis publicationmovingmovingnotdevelopednonenonein refugeoutsidehiding timegraphicalMartín and López 1999[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.42]optimalityCooper and Frederick 2007b[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.20]FID: flight initiation distance; MAD: nearest approach distance; PAL: preyapproach latency.The only scenario not yet modeled is escape or approach by prey when both thepredator and the prey are moving. This scenario is the most complex of thepossibilities shown in Table 2.5 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#TBLm-tblw-5].Relative speeds and directions of predator and prey are important when both aremoving. If they are moving away from each other, risk decreases, requiring noadditional behavioral alteration by the prey. If they are moving closer to eachother, maximum risk is influenced by the minimum bypass distance betweenpredator and prey if their trajectories are maintained. If the minimum bypassdistance is long enough, prey may not alter their movements. When the minimumbypass distance is shorter, prey might be predicted to stop farther from thepredator, as in the model of nearest approach distance, but the nearest approachdistance should then be longer than if the predator were immobile. If the preystops moving, the scenario shifts to that of FID models.When both predator and prey are moving, prey have options other than stopping(which would shift the encounter to the original scenario of Ydenberg and Dill1986 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.52]), such as changing trajectories toavoid coming closer to predators, fleeing in various directions, and enteringrefuge. A prey might alter its speed rather than its trajectory to increase theminimum bypass distance, or alter both speed and trajectory. Degree of predationrisk associated with the predator’s speed relative to that of the prey,lethality, and other factors affecting risk may be predicted to affect thepredator–prey distance at which prey change their speed, direction, or both, aswell as the magnitude of the changes. The effects of foraging, social, and otheropportunities should be to decrease the predator–prey distance when the prey’sbehavior is altered and decrease changes in speed and direction of movement. Ifthe predator alters its movements to attack, the focus shifts from decisions byprey prior to being attacked to a later stage of predator–prey encounters,pursuit.For linear trajectories, the slopes of the lines and the speeds determinewhether, when, and where intersection occurs. Nearest approach distance can becalculated using parametric equations of the vector values to determinedistances between predator and prey and then determine its minimum value, whichoccurs when the derivative of distance is zero. However, because predator andprey are free to change their trajectories, a linear model would have verylimited applicability. On the other hand, it might be possible to use such amodel to predict when a prey should alter its path and/or speed given a linearapproach by the predator. We know little of such dynamics prior to pursuit. Itwould be worthwhile to use video recording to assess the responses of preyapproaching a manipulatable model predator that in turn approaches the prey.2.11 CONCLUSIONSTheory is now available to guide empirical studies of many aspects of escapebehavior. Cost–benefit models have been very successful in making predictionsabout effects of factors that influence cost of fleeing and cost of not fleeingon FID and latency to flee, and about costs of emerging and not emerging fromrefuge on hiding time. The new model I presented here provides similarpredictions about the nearest approach distance for a prey approaching animmobile predator.Some escape variables have been neglected in escape models, especially thedistance fled, escape speed, escape trajectory when the predator does notpursue, and the probability of entering a refuge. Both distance fled andprobability of entering refuge are expected to increase as predation riskincreases and cost of fleeing decreases. However, the distance to the nearestrefuge may affect both decisions. These relationships have not been modeledformally. Nevertheless, predictions for distance fled and refuge entry madeusing the logic of the economic models of FID have often been verified (Cooper2009 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.29]). However, there are exceptions(Cooper 2009). Although some exceptions could be consequences of unrecordedvariation in distance to refuge, closer empirical examination of these variablesis needed. Theory to guide research on relationships between these variables andcosts and benefits would be very useful to inform such research.Optimality models analogous to that for FID (Cooper & Frederick 2007a[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.19], 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.21]) and hiding time (Cooper & Frederick2007b [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.20]) could easily be developed forlatency to flee and nearest approach distance. I have not done so here becausealmost all of their ordinal level predictions are the same as those of thegraphical FID model by Ydenberg and Dill (1986[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#REFe-r-2.52]). However, the optimality models allowthe prey to make better escape decisions, and would be useful in theoreticalstudies of fitness.Several other topics relevant to escape have received no theoretical attention.Models predicting the precise effects of alarm calling and other forms ofpursuit-deterrent signaling on FID would be useful. Escape trajectories andspeeds prior to pursuit have been largely ignored theoretically for terrestrialprey, but theory and empirical findings about trajectories are presented inChapter 8 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#CN-bp-8], with emphasis on aquatic prey.The complex case in which both predator and prey are moving, but pursuit has notbegun, will require explicit consideration of speeds and directions of movementby both predator and prey. Models and empirical studies of this scenario wouldgreatly expand our knowledge of escape behavior. Another area in which ourtheoretical understanding is limited is the pursuit phase of predator–preyencounters, which is discussed in Chapter 8 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#CN-bp-8].REFERENCESAmo, L., Lopez, P. & Martin, J.(2004).

Mostwere observational estimations of the distance at which big game animals fledfrom hunters, but some provided nuanced descriptions. In the quotation above,Roosevelt (1910 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.104]), knowingly or not,tells the reader that escape behavior in oribis (Ourebia ourebi) is contextual:when they are afforded concealing vegetation, oribi adopt a strategy of crypsiswith very short flight distances, and when they are encountered in more exposedenvironments, they take flight at much greater distances. In one of the first“comparative” studies of flight behavior, Swiss ethologist Heini Hediger (1964[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.52]) compiled a list of examples of flightdistances of various mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, and invertebrates; most ofthese entries were one-off observational statements of flight initiationdistance (FID) in each species, but others compared FID in different contexts.For example, Kearton (1929 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.58]) reportedthat giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) flee at 150 yards (135 m) from a man onfoot but at only 25 yards (23 m) from a motor-car; Darling (1937[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.38]) observed that red deer (Cervus elaphus)fled at 50 to 100 yards (46 to 91 m) when being fed but at 600 yards (549 m)when irritable. These and other early reports (Hone 1934[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.53]; McMillan 1954[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.82]; Denniston 1956[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.39]; Altmann 1958[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.4]; Estes & Goddard 1967[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.45]) were obviously less rigorous than thehypothesis-driven, structured studies of today that incorporate strict approachprotocols and statistical analyses, but they set the foundation for using escaperesponses as a proxy for animal stress and fear.Seminal work by Fritz Walther (1969 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.124]) onthe escape behavior of Thomson’s Gazelle (Eudorcas thomsonii) examined escapevariation in response to variation in many different factors, including predatorspecies, human activity, temperature, time of day, number of predators, andpredator speed. This significant increase in rigor spawned a variety of similarstudies in other ungulate species (as well as birds) throughout the 1970s and1980s (reviewed in Stankowich 2008 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.111]). Bythe 1980s, the first formal theories of escape behavior began to develop(Ydenberg & Dill 1986 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.128]). Studies ofescape responses in animals have become more and more commonplace, and we knowanimals pay attention to a wide variety of factors when deciding when to flee(Stankowich & Blumstein 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.113]). Despitea wealth of studies of the flight responses of birds (Chapter 4[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#CN-bp-4]) and reptiles (Chapter 5[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#CN-bp-5]), studies of flight responses in mammalshave been historically limited to ungulates, marsupials, and a few sciuridrodents. Given the exhaustive review of the factors influencing flight responsesin ungulates by Stankowich (2008 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.111]), thischapter will not seek to list every study of escape behavior in mammals, butinstead will outline the more significant factors influencing escape responsesin mammals, what we can learn from them, what has limited inquiry on this topicin mammals, a case study of reindeer and caribou (Rangifer tarandus), and whatour future goals should be in the study of mammal escape responses.3.2 PREDATORS OF MAMMALS AND OPTIONS FOR ESCAPEPerhaps more than for any other group of vertebrates, risk of predation formammals is largely based on body size: the larger a prey animal is, the fewerpotential predators it will have. But the relationship is not strictlydirectional. Larger mammal prey are often more desirable targets for largerpredators because of the greater energetic reward and smaller mammal prey areoften better able to employ crypsis to avoid detection or make use of refugia(e.g., burrows, trees). This often leaves mammals of intermediate size (500 g to10 kg) at greater risk due to the energetic rewards they confer and more limitedability to avoid detection due to small size; these intermediate-sized mammalstend to have lower metabolic rates, limiting their ability to rely on rapidescape, and are more likely to have morphological antipredator defenses (e.g.,spines, quills, body armor) (Lovegrove 2001[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.75]).The primary predators of mammals are other mammals, birds of prey, snakes, andsharks (in marine environments) and the vast majority of what we know aboutmammal escape behavior comes from studies of predation by mammalian carnivoresand birds of prey. Given their varied modes of locomotion and lifestyles,mammals show tremendous variation in how they flee from predators (Caro 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.30]): rapid running, jumping, dropping fromtrees to the ground, fleeing into a burrow or other cover, climbing trees,moving into water, and even flying away. Predator behavior, however, generallyvaries in two ways: hunting mode and pursuit duration. Many mammalian predators(e.g., felids), owls, and dangerous snakes hunt by stealth and may onlysuccessfully capture a prey animal by approaching very closely without beingdetected (these predators generally cannot sustain prolonged chases); if preydetect these predators within that range where capture is possible, escapelikely immediately follows detection. If the predator is detected at a greatenough distance where escape is highly likely, they will often simply monitorand possibly alert/harass the predator until it gives up. When models of largestealthy felid predators were exposed to Columbian black-tailed deer (Odocoileushemionus columbianus) from 15 to 50 m away, they never fled immediately, butinstead stayed alert, snorted, foot-stamped, and alarm walked in order to deterfurther approach by the potential predator and advertise awareness to thepredator (Stankowich & Coss 2007b [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.116];Stankowich 2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.112]). Note that mountainlions (Puma concolor) typically need to approach to within 5 to 10 m undetectedin order to have a chance to capture a deer (Smallwood 1993[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.108]). In fact, deer were most alarmed whenthe model was concealed following exposure (Stankowich, pers. observation);similar observations of heightened alarm responses when visual range is limitedhave been made in reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) groups interacting with humans(Reimers, pers. observations), and white-tailed deer fleeing in forests vs.pastures (O. virginianus) (Lagory 1987 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.61]).Coursing predators (e.g., canids) and many diurnal birds of prey, on the otherhand, can sustain prolonged chases and will initiate attack from longerdistances; therefore prey should flee from such predators at greater distancesin order to maintain a spatial margin of safety (Cárdenas et al. 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.28]). Yellow-bellied marmots (Marmotaflaviventris) were much more likely to flee from a gray wolf (Canis lupus) modelthan they were a mountain lion model, which elicited mostly high levels ofvigilance (Blumstein et al. 2009 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.22]).Mammals show tremendous variation in their escape strategies, but we cangenerally group them into four main categories: (1) flee at long range soonafter detection and recognition; (2) observe the predator, assess the risk itposes, and decide when to flee in a way that optimizes fitness; (3) rely oncrypsis until the last possible moment and then flee if necessary; and (4) holdone’s ground and employ defensive strategies or morphologies (e.g., armor,fighting, toxins). These strategies, however, can vary both intraspecificallyand interspecifically. Similar to Roosevelt’s oribi observations, spiny mice(Acomys cahirinus) show dichotomous escape initiation strategies: they eitherflee early at a long distance, or, if an individual is agile enough, remainfrozen and potentially cryptic until the last minute, fleeing only when thepredator is very close (Ilany & Eilam 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.54]).Wild ungulates are most vulnerable during their first few months of life and maysuffer substantial calf losses to predators. This selection pressure has led totwo different strategies, hiding and following, for neonatal defense or predatoravoidance (Lent 1974 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.68]). Followers,species in which the neonates accompany the mother within minutes or hours afterbirth, usually have highly developed social systems and inhabit open terrainwith a low vegetative profile. Hiders, species in which the young do notaccompany the mother for the first weeks of life, remain in seclusion, minimizetheir activity, and rely on cryptic coloration and a lack of scent glands toavoid predation. They often live in habitats of dense, high vegetation andrespond with alarm bradycardia (decrease in heart rate) upon detecting alarmstimuli, e.g., red deer (Cervus elaphus) (Espmark & Langvatn 1979[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.43], 1985[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.44]) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileusvirginianus) (Jacobsen 1979 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.55]). Deer fawnsremain cryptic, hiding in vegetation, and only flee when a predator approachesto within a few meters, and mothers with vulnerable fawns nearby may remainmotionless in the face of an approaching predator in an attempt to remainundetected. Detailed accounts of mothers defending their young come from earlyethological studies of large ungulates fending off would-be or attackingpredators (Lent 1974 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.68]): mule deer, O.hemionus (Hamlin & Schweitzer 1979 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.50]);white-tailed deer (Smith 1987 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.109]); elk,Cervus canadensis, and moose, Alces alces (Altmann 1963[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.5]); and pronghorn Antilocapra americana(Marion & Sexton 1979 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.77]). When confrontedwith coyotes (Canis latrans), white-tails tend to flee, whereas sympatric muledeer are more likely to bunch together with other individuals and attack thepredator (Lingle 2001 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.72]; Lingle & Wilson2001 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.73]). Female mule deer with calves willrun to and defend fawns that are being attacked by coyotes, using their powerfulforelegs to kick and often injure the attackers. Even species with powerfullyeffective defenses against predators sometimes just turn and run: striped skunks(Mephitis mephitis) ran from approaching predators in nearly 44% of interactions(Larivière & Messier 1996 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.64]).Flocking behavior is widespread among mammals, is most conspicuous among largerherbivores, and is primarily influenced by resource availability anddistribution (Matthiopoulos 2003 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.80]),parasites (biting flies, warble flies, and parasitoids; Mooring et al. 2004[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.85]), and predator pressure (Hamilton 1971[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.49]). Flight is generally the response whenherds interact with predators or humans. Muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus) and Africansavanna elephants (Loxodonta africana) are exceptions insomuch as their fluidfission–fusion social group system provides a cooperative defense of calvesagainst predators(Lent 1991 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.69]; Reynolds1993 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.101]; Archie et al. 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.8]).3.3 SCANNING FOR PREDATORS, RISK ASSESSMENT, AND FLIGHT INITIATION DISTANCEPrior to encounters with predators, mammals periodically scan their surroundingsfor potential threats that might be looming. This vigilance may be shared bymembers of a group, which would likely be more proficient at scanning than asolitary animal that must divide its time between scanning and other activities(e.g., foraging). There is a large literature suggesting that the distance atwhich a predator begins its approach toward an animal (starting distance: SD)and the distance at which the prey shows overt alertness to that predator (alertdistance: AD) are usually strongly correlated with FID (Blumstein 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.18]; Stankowich & Blumstein 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.113]; Stankowich & Coss 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.114]). Theory suggests that the farther awaya predator begins its approach and the farther away an animal becomes alert, thelonger the distance at which the prey will flee: an animal does better byfleeing earlier to avoid further opportunity costs of staying and maintaining alarger margin of safety (Blumstein 2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.20];Cooper & Blumstein 2014 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.36]).The relationships between SD, AD, and FID, however, are not necessarily linear.Blumstein (2003 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.18]) found that therelationship between SD and FID was logarithmic in some birds and linear inothers, and Blumstein and Daniel (2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.21])found a strong effect of SD on FID in a comparative analysis of macropodidmarsupials. Stankowich and Coss (2006 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.114])proposed that the relationship between SD and FID might be logarithmic or evenquadratic due to suboptimal scanning rates by prey. If a predator begins itsapproach from well outside the zone of awareness of a prey (the maximum range atwhich a prey animal can detect or cares to attend to a predator) the predatormay be able to approach closer to the prey before being detected (resulting in alower FID) relative to an approach where the predator lingers at the edge of thezone of awareness prior to approach and may be detected earlier (Figure 3.1[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#FIGm-fig-17]).[OEBPS_Images_image00912.jpeg]Figure 3.1Predicted relationship between flight initiation distance (FID) and startingdistance (SD), where Dmin is the minimum distance at which prey might assess apredator before fleeing and Dmax is the maximum distance at which prey caneither detect predators or consider them threatening enough to attend to.Toavoid opportunity costs, prey should flee at greater distance when they detectthe predator at greater distances. When a predator starts from well outside theprey’s zone of awareness (Dmin–Dmax), it might be able to approach more closelybefore detection due to suboptimal scanning (α2). Some animals may also be morereactive than others and have a higher Dmax (dashed curve).(Stankowich & Coss 2006 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.114])Due to suboptimal scanning (variation in α in Figure 3.1[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#FIGm-fig-17]: prey cannot detect every predator thatenters their zone of awareness the instant that the predator enters it),approaches with longer SD may have shorter FID than those with an SD at thelimits of the zone of awareness. Finally, there is often tremendous individualvariation in fearfulness or boldness within a population, with some more fearfulanimals likely having larger zones of awareness than others (Figure 3.1[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#FIGm-fig-17]: dashed curve). Stankowich and Coss(2006 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.114]) approached black-tailed deerfrom very long distances away, measuring SD, AD, and FID in order to test thesehypotheses, and found that a quadratic model provided the best fit to the data(Figure 3.2a [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#FIGm-fig-18]).[OEBPS_Images_image00913.jpeg]Figure 3.2Scatterplots showing relationships between starting distance, alert distance,flight initiation distance, and assessment time of Columbian black-tailed deerin response to a human approacher. (a) Starting distance vs. flight initiationdistance: black circles indicate deer that were not alert prior to approach(logarithmic model fit with thin black line), open triangles indicated deer thatwere alert prior to approach (logistic model fit with dashed line), thick blackline indicates overall quadratic model fit (compare to Figure 3.1[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#FIGm-fig-17]). (b) Alert distance vs. startingdistance; thick curve is a cubic model fit suggesting that deer became alertlater when approaches started from outside the zone of awareness. (c) Alertdistance vs. flight initiation distance; thick curve is a logarithmic modelshowing that flight initiation distance increases with alert distance but levelsoff at Dmax. (d) Alert distance vs. assessment time; deer that became alertearlier assessed the approacher for longer periods (there was no correlationbetween assessment time and flight initiation distance.(Stankowich & Coss 2006 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.114])Animals that may have been more fearful of humans (those that were alert priorto approach) had greater FIDs, resulting in a logarithmic model providing thebest fit and suggesting that they have a wider zone of awareness, as predicted.This suboptimal scanning hypothesis was further bolstered by the finding thatthe relationship between SD and AD was also non-linear, with the greatest SDsleading to somewhat shorter ADs than those trials where the approach began atthe limits of the zone of awareness (Figure 3.2b[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#FIGm-fig-18]). This suggests that the human was ableto approach closer to the deer without being detected when he approached fromgreater distances. Finally, Stankowich and Coss (2006[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.114]) found a logarithmic relationshipbetween AD and FID (Figure 3.2c [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#FIGm-fig-18]): whendeer became alert at very great distances, they typically did not fleeimmediately, instead waiting until the approacher came within 60 to 100 m beforetaking flight. This finding strengthens the argument that prey assess the threatposed by an approaching predator prior to flight in order to avoid potentiallyunnecessary and costly bouts of flight; when prey become alert at greaterdistances they have the luxury of assessing the threat for longer periods oftime compared to when detection occurs at a very short distance (Figure 3.2d[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#FIGm-fig-18]). Further analyses revealed effects ofthis pre-flight risk assessment on subsequent escape behavior (e.g., distancefled (DF), escape angle, running style) (Stankowich & Coss 2007a[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.115]).3.4 FACTORS INFLUENCING ESCAPE DECISIONS IN MAMMALSA huge number of biotic and abiotic factors are known to influence escapedecisions in animals (Stankowich & Blumstein 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.113]) and most of these have been shown insome form in mammals. Stankowich (2008 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.111])provided a comprehensive review of escape behavior in ungulates and how itrelates to conservation and management; therefore we will not perform a similarreview here. Instead we will focus on some of the more important factors formammals and then examine a case study of escape behavior in reindeer and caribou(Rangifer spp.) because a significant amount of research has been conducted inthis system on flight decisions.3.4.1 EFFECTS OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND DISTANCE TO REFUGESeveral non-predatory factors in the environment can affect escape decisions inmammals. Mammals appear to be very sensitive to small spatial variation in riskof capture in different environments. Stankowich (2008[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.111]) found greater escape responses inungulates in open environments compared to more densely vegetated areas;although some studies didn’t find such an effect. Habitat cover also shortensFID in red kangaroos (Macropus rufus) and euros (M. robustus erubescens) (Wolf &Croft 2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.127]) and brown bears (Ursusarctos) (Moen et al. 2012 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.84]). In barrenhabitats one would expect that mammals that are unable to escape undergroundwould seek higher country to improve visual control. Running upslope was themost common response in reindeer when disturbed (Baskin & Skogland 1997[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.11]; Colman et al. 2001[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.33]). For example, Reimers found thatreindeer groups more often fled uphill (59%) compared to flat (20%) and downhill(21%) flight paths. (E. Reimers, unpublished data). The same data set shows thatsmell is an important sense for environmental control: the reindeer groups fledinto headwind more often (51%) than crosswind (26%) or tailwind (23%). Wolves(Canis lupus) fled at shorter distances in stronger winds (Karlsson et al. 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.57]). Similar to other taxa (Stankowich &Blumstein 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.113]), many mammal specieshave been found to flee at greater distance when they are farther from refugecompared to when there is refuge nearby: woodchucks (Marmota monax; Bonenfant &Kramer 1996 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.24]; Kramer & Bonenfant 1997[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.60]), Eastern gray squirrels (Sciuruscarolinensis; Dill & Houtman 1989 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.41]), anddegus (Octodon degus; Lagos et al. 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.62]); Stafl (2013[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.110]) found no such effect in the Americanpika (Ochotona princeps).Insect harassment has been shown to have profound effects on mammal behavior andmorphology. For example recent evidence suggests that zebra stripes were favoredby natural selection in environments with oppressive activity of biting fliesfor much of the year (Caro et al. 2014 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.29]).Insect harassment may have even a greater effect on escape behavior in largemammals than both human infrastructure and predators. During the brief growingseason in Arctic and high-mountain ecosystems, undisturbed grazing is crucial inorder for reindeer to maximize growth and fattening. In particular warble flies(Hypoderma tarandi) and nose bot flies (Cephenemyia trompe; hereafter referredto as oestrid flies) influence Rangifer behavior (Mörschel & Klein 1997[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.86]; Anderson et al. 2001[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.7]; Hagemoen & Reimers 2002[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.48]) and may amplify or decrease responsethresholds in relation to human and predator activities. Throughout warmsummers, reindeer are exposed to vigorous oestrid fly harassment, which causesdramatic decreases in feeding and lying, and increase in walking, running, andstanding (Figure 3.3 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#FIGm-fig-19]). Snow patches,marshes, and windy mountain tops were used primarily to avoid oestrid flyharassment and animals may flee long distances to avoid the insects. Even thoughRangifer are disturbed by human activities, they can increase their tolerancetoward humans if insect harassment is severe, as shown for domesticated reindeer(Skarin et al. 2004 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.107]) and caribouobserved within the Prudhoe Bay oil field (Pollard et al. 1996[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.89]). Oil-field gravel pads and roads wereused as insect relief habitats (Murphy & Curatolo 1987[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.87]; Pollard et al. 1996[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.89]), as animals frequently occupy and takeadvantage of the shade of buildings and pipelines.[OEBPS_Images_image00914.jpeg]Figure 3.3Activity budgets (means) of reindeer from scan sampling in relation to oestridfly harassment in Norefjell and Rondane wild reindeer areas inNorway in 1997. (0= none, 1 = light, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe.)(Hagemoen & Reimers 2002 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.48])3.4.2 HABITUATION TO HUMAN DISTURBANCES AND HUNTINGThe vast majority of studies of the effects of human density and traffic onmammal escape behavior have shown that mammals are able to habituate to humansin their environment. Populations in areas with less exposure to humans (smallerpopulations, less vehicle traffic) have greater FIDs than populations with moreexposure to humans, and this finding is robust across different mammalian taxa:ungulates (McMillan 1954 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.82]; Denniston 1956[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.39]; Walther 1969[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.124]; Rowe-Rowe 1974[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.105]; Tyler 1991[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.119]; Cassirer et al. 1992[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.31]; Recarte et al. 1998[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.92]; Colman et al. 2001[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.33]; Bekoff & Gese 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.12]), marmots (Louis & Le Beere 2000[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.74]; Griffin et al. 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.47]; Li et al. 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.70]), and squirrels (McCleery 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.81]; Chapman et al. 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.32]). There may be, however, a sampling biassuch that investigators have preferentially focused their research on speciesthat habituate easily to humans due to ease of access. In fact, some studieshave found no habituation effect (Alados & Escos 1988[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.2]; Lehrer et al. 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.67]), and some mammals (especially predatoryspecies) are known to not habituate well to humans. However, Wam et al. (2014[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.125]) recorded a high level of individualplasticity in behavioral responses by protected, re-introduced wolves in Norwaytoward humans, suggesting that habituation to humans may occur over a longerperiod of time.In a meta-analysis of ten studies, Stankowich (2008[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.111]) found that populations of ungulatesunder hunting pressure had significantly greater flight responses thannon-hunted populations, and more evidence from giraffes (Marealle et al. 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.76]) and reindeer (Baskin & Hjalten 2001[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.10]) has supported this finding. Thetendency to habituate in ungulates is so strong that the dis-habituating effectsof seasonal hunting may not be strong enough to overcome the habituating effectsof non-consumptive human exposure (e.g., recreationists) during the rest of theyear (Reimers et al. 2009 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.96]), and theinterests of both hunters and wildlife watchers may be satisfied if a balance isstruck between these practices.3.4.3 TYPE OF DISTURBANCEThe type of disturbance, be it anthropogenic or a non-human predator, has asignificant impact on flight decisions in mammals. Stankowich (2008[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.111]) found humans on foot to elicitstronger reactions from ungulates (meta-analysis of 11 studies) compared toother types of anthropogenic disturbance (e.g., automobiles, military noise,bicycles, snowmobiles), but sometimes very large machines can be more evocativethan pedestrians. Gray (1973 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.46]) observedmuskoxen to respond more strongly to aircraft than to humans, and harbor seals(Phoca vitulina) showed greater AD and FID to boats compared to pedestrians(Andersen et al. 2012 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.6]). Past experiencewith such vehicles as a result of being chased by snow machines, helicopters, orfixed wing aircrafts (accidentally or for tagging or other purposes) can rapidlyincrease alertness and escape behavior. When humans have been a historicalsource of predation or disturbance, mammals clearly treat them as more dangerousthan less threatening human transports (e.g., automobiles, bicycles), but themuch greater size of some transports might override this effect and may engendergreater fear than single humans on foot, similar to studies from other taxaindicating greater flight responses to larger rather than smaller predators(Stankowich & Blumstein 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.113]).Different types of animal predators may also engender greater responses thanothers according to the relative predation risk they pose. Humans typicallyevoke a response greater than or equal to the response to domestic dogs (Hone1934 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.53]; Hamr 1988[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.51]; Kloppers et al. 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.59]) and wolves (Bergerud 1974[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.16]), but free-ranging dogs remain asignificant source of disturbance and stress for wild mammals (Weston &Stankowich 2014 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.126]). Reindeer had greaterAD, FID, and DF in response to a human disguised as a polar bear (Ursusmaritimus) than to a human in dark hiking gear (see case study). Finally,Thomson’s gazelles (Eudorcas thomsonii) varied their FID dynamically in responseto different species of mammalian predator. Wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) evoked thegreatest FIDs, followed by cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus), lions (Panthera leo),hyenas (Crocuta crocuta), and finally jackals (Canis mesomelas); this orderclosely agrees with the relative risk posed by each species to the gazelles(Table 3.1 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#TBLm-tblw-6]; Walther 1969[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.124]). Jackals rarely ever attack adults andreally are only dangerous to fawns. Hyenas kill more fawns than adults but packsof hyenas are far more dangerous to adults than solitary hyenas, resulting insignificantly greater FIDs in response to hyena packs relative to solitaryindividuals. Gazelles flee from lions between 50 and 300 m, a comfortabledistance given that lions will kill adults but prefer larger ungulates if theyare available. Gazelles show mortal fear of wild dogs and cheetahs, which preferto hunt gazelles, and to which they responded at the greatest distances (Walther1969 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.124]). Mammals clearly assess riskdynamically in response to the threat posed by different types of disturbancesand predators, and the types of experiences individuals have with thosepredators also greatly influences flight decisions (Stankowich & Blumstein 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.113]; Stankowich 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.111]).Table 3.1 Flight initiation distances from different mammalian predators byThomson’s gazelles (expressed as percentage of cases).Predator5–50 m51–100 m101–300 m301–500 m501–1000 m>1000mNJackal8515____66Hyena295010461155Lion3286252_71Cheetah13572215288Wilddog_413204815443.4.4 EFFECTS OF GROUP SIZETemporary or permanent aggregations commonly formed by mammals have a variety ofpotential benefits (enhanced vigilance, greater ability to find food or mates,group defense, etc.) and potential costs (easier to locate by predators,potential for disease transmission, interference effects during foraging, socialagonism). Declining individual vigilance efforts with increasing group size hasbeen widely reported for both mammals and birds (Elgar 1989[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.42]; Lima 1995[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.71]). Wild reindeer in Norway and also onSvalbard adhere to this effect (Reimers et al. 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.97], .2012[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.99]). The effects of group size on escapedecisions in mammals, however, have been far less predictable. Stankowich andBlumstein (2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.113]) found a positiveeffect of group size on FID in terrestrial organisms, but Stankowich (2008[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.111]) found only a weak, non-robust positiveeffect (r = 0.13; k = 21 studies) in a meta-analysis on ungulates whereheterogeneity among studies was enormous (I2 = 96%). Some studies showed largepositive effects (Stankowich & Coss 2007a[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.115]), while others showed strong negativeeffects (Matson et al. 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.79]). Wildreindeer in Norway conform to the latter strategy, FID and DF decreased withincreasing group size (Reimers et al. 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.99]), but the insular wild reindeer ofSvalbard have lost their group size effect (Colman et al. 2001[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.33]; Reimers et al. 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.97]). Costly antipredator behavior such asthese group size effects should not persist on islands once there is no netbenefit (Blumstein & Daniel 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.21]). Andindeed, the traditional grouping behavior that characterizes Rangifer elsewhereis absent in Svalbard, where animals live individually or in small groups. Highvigilance rates will in most cases compromise feeding time, as suggested by(Laundre et al. 2001 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.65]). The low scanfrequency and total scan duration found in reindeer should not compromisefeeding efficiency in any of the study herds. This intraspecific variation inthe direction and effect size of group size on escape decisions suggests thatgroup size effects likely interact with the history of the population,reproductive state of the group members, lethality and intensity of humanexposure, or openness of the landscape to permit the benefits of collectivevigilance (Stankowich 2008 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.111]).3.4.5 EFFECTS OF INSULARITY AND LOSS OF PREDATORSMany studies have shown that local extinction of predators for prolonged periodsrelaxes natural selection on predator recognition. Over hundreds or thousands ofyears, prey may lose the ability to recognize locally extinct predators asdangerous (Coss 1999 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.37]; Berger et al. 2001[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.15]; Blumstein & Daniel 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.21]; Blumstein 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.19]; Stankowich & Coss 2007b[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.116]; Lahti et al. 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.63]). Tests of the effects of relaxedselection on escape behavior in mammals are more limited. For instance,Blumstein found that tammar wallabies (Macropus eugenii) living on predator-freeislands allowed humans to approach much nearer than tammars living on mainlandAustralia (Blumstein 2002 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.17]). In a broadercomparative analysis of FIDs in macropodid marsupials, while insularityinfluenced foraging and vigilance behaviors, living on islands and loss ofpredators did not have significant effects on escape decisions (see group sizediscussion above; Blumstein & Daniel 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.21]), suggesting that effects of relaxedselection may vary between species or be more specifically correlated with timeelapsed since isolation. Insular Svalbard reindeer and Greenland caribou showsimilar effects on foraging and escape decisions (see group size effects aboveand case study below). Generally, FID may be highly dependent on the individualexperiences with predators and humans (Blumstein & Daniel 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.21]), and one significant traumatic eventmay be enough to restore recognition of, and responsiveness to, a previouslyabsent predator (Berger et al. 2001 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.15]).3.4.6 SOCIAL AND REPRODUCTIVE EFFECTSReproductive status influences the escape decisions of both sexes, but a paucityof studies limits our ability to make strong inferences. During times of peakmating (e.g., the rut in ungulates), males typically experience increased costsof fleeing (Ydenberg & Dill 1986 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.128]) as itmay mean abandoning an attractive high-quality territory or even a group ofdefendable females. This effect has been shown most convincingly in fish andlizards (Shallenberger 1970 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.106]; Cooper1997 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.34], 1999[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.35]; Martín & López 1999[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.78]), but less evidence exists for mammals.Moose and reindeer in rut are much more tolerant of an approaching human thanthey are just before the rut or when in velvet (Altmann 1958[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.4]; Reimers et al. 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.99]), and territorial gazelles flee atshorter distances than solitary bachelors (Walther 1969[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.124]). Rowe-Rowe (1974[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.105]), however, found no effect of the ruton flight decisions in blesbok (Damaliscus dorcas). Similar effects of the costsof fleeing occur when individuals are forced to leave a profitable food patch:socially forging degus (Octodon degus) fled at shorter distances in food-richpatches, compared to patches with less food.Female mammals tend to be warier than males (Stankowich 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.111]), suggesting that the costs of fleeingare greater for males and/or the benefits of fleeing in the form of protectionof nearby offspring and future reproductive potential are greater for females.In fact, many ungulate studies have shown that females with calves flee at muchgreater distances and flee longer distances than those without calves(Stankowich 2008 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.111]; Reimers et al. 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.97]). The presence of pups outside theburrow led to increased AD and FID in Alpine marmots (Marmota marmota) (Louis &Le Beere 2000 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.74]). Females of some speciesmay even dynamically assess the escape abilities of their young when decidingwhen to flee from predators: female red kangaroos (Macropus rufus) and femaleeuros (M. robustus) fled at greater distances when they had young at footcompared to those carrying young in their pouch (Wolf & Croft 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.127]). In sum, both sexes have reproductiveconsiderations during risk assessment, but the different roles that each sexplays in mating and parental investment influences their costs and benefits offleeing in different ways.3.4.7 DOMESTICATION EFFECTSPrice and King (1968 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.91]) proposed that‘‘domestication is an evolutionary process involving the genotypic adaptation ofanimals to the captive environment.’’ There is limited experimental research onthe evolution of different traits, including behavior, during domestication.However, there is sufficient evidence based on comparative studies of domesticstocks and their wild ancestors, to identify a number of typical domesticationchanges, including the following aspects (Jensen 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.56]): external and internal morphology,physiology, body development, and behavior, which in this context includesreduced fear, increased sociability, and reduced antipredator responses (Price1997 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.90]). Interestingly, this complex ofchanges may develop rapidly, in only a few generations, and in concert, eventhough only one of the traits is selected for. Belyaev et al. (1985[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.13]) selected farm foxes only for reducedfearfulness toward humans, and found that the frequency of animals showing thiscomplex of adaptations, including morphological and physiological changes,increased dramatically within 10 to 20 generations. Eurasian reindeer, which arethe origin of caribou, may exemplify such complex and rapid adaptations (Reimerset al. 2012 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.99], 2014[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.100]; Nieminen 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.88]). This subspecies was only recentlydomesticated by humans, with extensive control of specific herds first evolvingduring the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries (Mirov 1945[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.83]). As is demonstrated in the case study,domestication of wild mammals can have significant effects on their escapebehavior.3.5 CASE STUDY: REINDEER AND CARIBOU3.5.1 INTRODUCTIONReindeer and caribou belong to the same species (Rangifer tarandus), butdifferent subspecies (Banfield 1961 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.9]).Although the basic behavioral repertoire in the various subspecies appearsfundamentally uniform (Thomson 1980 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.118]),many differences in recorded behavior relate to degree of domestication and tovariable factors in the physical and biological environment, herd size andstructure, and past experience. While the caribou subspecies are wild, theFennoscandian tundra reindeer include herds with both wild and domestic originthat vary in number and ecology. The relationship between life historystrategies, behavior, and genetics in herds of reindeer that comprisecontemporary wild and domestic stocks remains a focal research field. Hunting isthe only important wild reindeer mortality factor, because traditionalpredators, although permanently present or present as stragglers, exert onlyminor predatory influence. All study herds in Norway are extensively hunted, butmolecular genetic analyses (Røed et al. 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.102], 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.102]) shows a clear genetic structure amongthe study herds that reflect varying degrees of domestic or wild ancestry. Theinsular Svalbard reindeer is the northernmost population of Rangifer inhabitingan environment without parasitizing insects and, except for a few observationsof polar bear (Ursus maritimus) predation (Derocher et al. 2000[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.40]), no predators (other than man). Thissituation has prevailed for at least 4000 years (Van der Knaap 1986[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.121]; Tyler & Øritsland 1989[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.120]). Unlike Rangifer subspecies elsewhere,Svalbard reindeer live individually or in small groups (Alendal & Byrkjedal 1976[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.3]), are seasonally sedentary (Tyler &Øritsland 1989 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.120]), and do not have thenomadic behavior known from other subspecies of Rangifer.In the absence of four-legged predators, this case study deals with observationsof Rangifer behavioral responses primarily to human disturbances in terms ofdirect provocations by individuals on foot, on ski, or on snowmobile. As aresult of extensive field testing in a variety of populations with differentdegrees of genetic separation from wild reindeer and experiencing differentlevels of hunting and human recreation exposure, we begin to see howdomestication, hunting, and habituation interact to influence escape decisions.3.5.2 HABITUATION IN RELATION TO GENETICS, HUNTING AND TOURIST ACTIVITIESAssuming domestication selects for and supports tameness, researchers haveinvestigated whether wild reindeer with some domestic ancestry and exposed tohunting remain tame or adopt wild behavior. In the past, restocking ofpreviously wild reindeer habitats has occurred through release of reindeer fromdomestic herds under the assumption that “a reindeer is a reindeer” and that theintroduced animals would eventually adopt behavior similar to wild animals(i.e., redevelop increased vigilance and fear responses). Contrary toexpectations, extensive hunting (annual harvest around 30% of the winter herds)since 1956 in Forollhogna, 1967 in Ottadalen, and 1992 in Norefjell has onlyslightly altered the hard-wired behavioral traits indicative of their history ofdomestication (Figure 3.4a,b [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#FIGm-fig-20]). Thefrequency of watching the person before flight (Figure 3.5[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#FIGm-fig-21]) was 30 to 50% among the wild reindeerherds compared to 80 to 90% among the domestic herds (Reimers et al. 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.99]). Wild populations on Svalbard showequally weak escape responses, suggesting that factors other than domesticationplay a larger role in escape responses of Rangifer.[OEBPS_Images_image00915.jpeg]Figure 3.4(a) Vigilance and (b) escape distances among wild reindeer herds in Norway andin South Georgia and Svalbard. Reindeer of mainly wild origin is denoted W,reindeer with mixed origin WD, and reindeer with domestic origin D. All herds inNorway are hunted on a sustainable basis (attempted kept at a carrying capacitylevel) while the two hunted herds in Svalbard (Colesdalen and Sassendalen) aresubject to light hunting pressure. Hunting was initiated in 1992 in Norefjelland escape data were recorded the summer before hunt (Norefjell I) and again in2002 to 2006 (Norefjell II). Recreational activities (REC.) are high (H) inNorefjell and Blefjell in Norway and Adventdalen in Svalbard, but moderate (M)in the other areas except in the remote Edgeøya (L) where reindeer rarely areexposed to humans. (X-axis in (b) is broken at 600 m for Rondane andHardangervidda to allow for a closer inspection of the shorter distances in theother areas. Distance fled is 1722 m in Rondane and 1535 m in Hardangervidda;the SE are maintained in the figure). Recordings of vigilance in South Georgiawere made before the eradication of the herd. In a few cases we were able tomeasure AD but not FID, and FID and not AD. The discrepancies are caused bythese unbalanced samples.(Data from Reimers et al. 2009 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.96], 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.97], 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.98], 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.99]; Reimers & Eftestøl 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.94], and unpublished.)[OEBPS_Images_image00916.jpeg]Figure 3.5Alerted reindeer males in Ottadalen in May. Antlers in growth and in velvet.As for the effects of extensive hunting, great differences in vigilance andescape responses persist between the populations despite similar levels ofhunting (Figure 3.4 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#FIGm-fig-20]). Rondane andOttadalen are both hunted and experience moderate levels of human exposure, yetreindeer in Rondane show much greater escape responses than those in Ottadalen.Moreover, escape behavior in Norefjell did not change from before hunting wasinitiated (Norefjell I) after more than ten years of extensive hunting(Norefjell II). Finally, wild reindeer from Svalbard that are subject to lighthunting or no hunting show similar vigilance and escape responses to many of thehunted populations of domestic origin in Norway.As previously discussed, the frequency of encounters with humans may affectungulate antipredator behavior (see reviews by Stankowich 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.111]; Tarlow & Blumstein 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.117]). Although disputed (e.g., Reimers &Colman 2006 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.93]; Reimers et al. 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.95]), displacement is the effect most oftenpredicted when recreational activities in wild reindeer are discussed (e.g.,Vistnes & Nellemann 2008 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.123]). Whilepredator pressure is low for all herds, recreational activity has potentiallyinfluenced escape responses (Figure 3.4b[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#FIGm-fig-20]): recreation and tourism are extensivein Norefjell but moderate in the other areas, and the lower vigilance rate andflight response distances in Norefjell compared to Ottadalen, in spite ofcomparable domestic origin and extensive hunting, may reflect habituation to thehigh level of recreational activities in the former. Wild reindeer in Blefjellare exposed to humans more frequently than in Hardangervidda, from which theBlefjell herd originates. The escape response distances (AD, FID, and DF) wereshorter in Blefjell than in Hardangervidda, while the probability of assessingthe observer before fleeing tended to be greater in Blefjell (Reimers et al.2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.97]). In Svalbard, Reimers andcolleagues (2011 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.97]) found that vigilancewas higher in reindeer in Edgeøya than in the four Spitzbergen areas. Escaperesponses (AD, FID, and DF) were all shorter in Adventdalen, with itsconsiderably higher amounts of human activities and infrastructure than theother study areas, a finding consistent with habituation toward humans.Greenland caribou escape behavior was similar to that of Svalbard reindeer(Aastrup 2000 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.1]), reflecting similarhistories of the two populations, both having existed for an extended periodwithout large predators and with little hunting interference. Lower probabilityof assessing before fleeing in Edgeøya (63% vs. 94% in the Nordenskiöld Landareas), along with their higher vigilance, may indicate more frequentinteractions with polar bears in Edgeøya in recent years (Reimers & Eftestøl2012 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.94]). The overall picture painted bythe results in Figure 3.4 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#FIGm-fig-20] suggests thatvigilance and escape responses are likely the result of an interaction betweengenetic origin, exposure to lethal hunting by humans and predators, andnon-lethal human recreational activities. Areas lacking predation and havinghigh exposure to humans show very weak escape responses and human recreation hasbeen shown to cause moderate increases in escape responses due to short burstsof seasonal hunting (Stankowich 2008 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.111]).3.5.3 RANGIFER AND PREDATORSAlthough the literature on Rangifer and their key predators is comprehensive,only two papers (Bøving & Post 1997 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.25];Aastrup 2000 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.1]) address escape behavior andvigilance in caribou to predators. A short publication (Reimers & Eftestøl 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.94]) includes escape metrics. Female caribouin Alaska foraged in larger groups, displayed a higher rate of vigilance duringfeeding, and spent less time feeding than did female caribou in West Greenlandwithout predators (Bøving & Post 1997 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.25]).The results indicate that caribou, like several other species of ungulates, showbehavioral adaptations to the risk of predation that are relaxed when this riskis reduced. Svalbard reindeer interact commonly with polar bears. Field work onEdgeøya, Svalbard, measured reindeer response distances from a stalking polarbear, approaches from a person disguised as a polar bear, and “normal” humanencounters (Figure 3.4b [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#FIGm-fig-20]). Alert andflight initiation distances and distance fled were 1.6, 2.5, and 2.3 timeslonger, respectively, when Svalbard reindeer were encountered by a persondisguised as a polar bear compared to a person in dark hiking gear. Populationincrease of polar bears on Svalbard and decrease in sea-ice cover in the Arcticregion during summer probably results in more frequent interactions withreindeer on the archipelago, indicating a predator–prey relationship between thetwo species on Edgeøya.A key prediction of the multipredator hypothesis (Blumstein 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.19]) is that isolation from all predatorsmay lead to a rapid loss of antipredator behavior, including loss of the groupsize effect and breakdown of predator recognition abilities. For example, bothreindeer and caribou from predator-free regions (Svalbard and West Greenland)were about 3.5 times less vigilant to playback of wolf howling at control sites(Denali National Park and Tetlin Wildlife Refuge) (Berger 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.14]). Experience-dependent behavior may belost after the first generation in the absence of predators, while more“hard-wired” antipredator behavior may persist for thousands of years followingisolation from predators (Byers 1997 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.27];Coss 1999 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.37]). Domestic reindeer fromNorway were introduced to South Georgia in 1911–12 and in 1925 (Leader Williams1988 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.66]). After 100 years in absence ofpredators, vigilance is strongly relaxed (Figure 3.4[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#FIGm-fig-20]). On the other hand,experience-dependent behavior may be quickly restored the first time individualsencounter predators (Brown et al. 1997 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.26];Aastrup 2000 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.1]; Berger et al. 2001[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.15]). In accordance with this, vigilancerates displayed by Svalbard reindeer in Edgeøya, a location with a dense polarbear population, were 2.2 times higher than those of reindeer in NordenskiöldLand that had fewer polar bears.3.6 CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONSResults from escape behavior studies have strong implications for conservationand management measures in land use planning. Stankowich (2008[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.111]) makes several suggestions: (1) a broadunderstanding of how reproductive state and individual biology affects escapedecisions is critical for predicting temporal variation in behavior; (2) theinteraction between hunting and non-lethal recreation effects may allowconsumptive management of populations and still permit convenient wildlifeviewing opportunities for ecotourists; (3) knowledge of the extent to whichother predators maintain antipredator responses may help predict how wildmammals will respond to human approach; (4) nearby alternative sites may allowwildlife to avoid high levels of human disturbance; and (5) wildlife may responddifferently to humans depending on the openness of the environment and distanceto potential refugia. Beyond these points, response distances may aid inestablishment of buffer zones needed to maintain functional habitats forindividual herds (Blumstein & Fernández-Juricic 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.22]).3.7 FOCI FOR THE FUTURE STUDY OF MAMMAL ESCAPE BEHAVIORThe theory and empirical study of escape behavior and risk assessment has beenprimarily driven by research on birds and reptiles, and, although there is anextensive literature on habituation to human disturbances in large mammals, weknow comparatively little about the nuances of mammalian risk assessment. Giventhe depth of the current literature and the logistical difficulties of workingon mammals, we suggest several areas of focus for future work on mammalianescape behavior.Most studies of escape behavior in mammals examine a single factor or simplytest for main effects of several factors. When animals pay attention to multiplefactors simultaneously, different factors may interact to create non-additiveeffects on risk assessment and flight decisions. Some factors may only beimportant in certain contexts. The effect of distance to the burrow and foodabundance only had significant effects on escape responses of degus when theywere in social foraging groups, and not when solitary (Vásquez et al. 2002[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.122]). Interaction effects may beexceedingly important to creating a deeper understanding of the risk assessmentprocess – not just in mammals but in all animals. Potentially interestinginteractions for investigation include sex × season, group size × season, andgroup size × habitat type or distance to refuge.As previously mentioned, most studies of escape behavior in mammals have focusedon ungulates, which tend to be easy to detect from long distance, habituate wellto humans (and are thus easy to find), and are often targets of human hunting(making humans more relevant as potential predators). Ungulates are alsofrequently the focus of key conservation issues in land use conflicts. Broadertaxonomic representation is needed, however, to test the same hypothesesregarding the factors influencing risk assessment. Medium-sized to largerodents, marsupials, armadillos, and rabbits could all prove to be tractableresearch subjects for studies of escape behavior given their visibility andlifestyle.Similar to Møller’s comparative studies of escape behavior in European and Asianbirds (Chapter 4 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#CN-bp-4]), evolutionary andcomparative studies of risk assessment in mammals should be undertaken tounderstand which factors are most important across taxa and which are moreimportant to individual species with unique ecologies. The taxa mentioned abovewould be excellent candidates for broad, potentially collaborative, taxon-widestudies of escape behavior using standardized approaches (Chapter 16[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#CN-bp-16]). These data could also be compared tothose from birds and reptiles and other taxa to understand how mammalian ecologyinfluences the factors affecting risk assessment.3.8 CONCLUSIONSThere is a rich history of studying escape behavior in wild mammals. Most of theoriginal observations of flight initiation distance by Hediger (1964[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.52]) and later workers were made on large,charismatic mammals, primarily to settle conservation conflicts. Nevertheless,while empirical work on flight decisions of birds and reptiles has flourished,similar studies in mammals have been limited primarily to ungulates (Reimers &Colman 2006 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.93]; Stankowich 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.111]), for which humans are often a realizedpredator, and not just hypothetical proxy for a predator. Recent literature onescape behavior of mammals is slowly becoming more taxonomically diverse: brownbears (Moen et al. 2012 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.84]) and squirrelsand marmots (Griffin et al. 2007 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.47];McCleery 2009 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.81]; Lehrer et al. 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.67]; Li et al. 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.70]; Chapman et al. 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#REFe-r-3.32]). Experience with predators,reproductive effects, and predator hunting behaviors have strong effects onmammalian escape responses. Future efforts should strive to test targetedinteractions between factors to understand how species weigh the importance ofeach factor in different situations. Conducting comparative studies usingstandard approaches on a wide range of species will also promote anunderstanding of how morphological traits and ecological variables influencerisk assessment.REFERENCESAastrup, P.

Darwin (1868[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.25]) described in detail how domesticationresulted in loss of fear in birds and mammals, and that a number of differentkinds of flight behavior seen in wild animals were lost when animals lived inhuman proximity. Hediger (1934 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.42])synthesized the literature on escape behavior including the distance at whichanimals became alert and that at which they fled an approaching predator,including humans, in a diverse array of organisms. The review by Hedigerexplicitly noted that different components of escape such as FID, flightdirection, and alert distance (AD) reflected different aspects of flightbehavior that could all, or in different combinations, change over the course ofevolution. Hediger also pointed out how individuals, populations, and speciesdiffered in escape behavior, and that island populations showed less fear thanmainland populations of the same or related species. Rand (1964[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.78]) showed that FID was inversely relatedto body temperature in a lizard, implying that FID varied with risk ofpredation. Cooke (1980 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.22]) noticed thaturban birds had much shorter flight distances than rural populations of the samespecies, and that this difference depended on body size, the difference beinglarger in small species with high metabolism. This change in behavior wasfunctional in the sense that it allowed birds to coexist with humans even athigh human population densities that caused frequent disturbance. Burger (1981[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.14]), Burger and Gochfeld (1981[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.15]), and several others noticed that humandisturbance affected FID at seabird colonies, and that such disturbance couldresult in habitat use alteration and reduced reproductive performance. Theseearly studies placed research on escape behavior and FID firmly in the contextof conservation biology, where it has remained ever since (Blumstein &Fernández-Juricic 2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.9]).In this chapter I use the definitions of FID and related terms as described inChapter 1 [OEBPS_Text_part0009.xhtml#CN-bp-1]. Starting distance (SD) and AD areaspects of escape behavior that arise for methodological or biological reasons,and some of these components show significant covariation with FID (e.g.,Blumstein 2003 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.5]). Despite recenttheoretical suggestions (Blumstein 2010; Cooper & Blumstein 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.23]) and empirical evidence (reviewed bySamia et al. 2013 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.85]) that suggestbiological mechanisms underlie covariation between AD (or SD) and FID, at leastpart of this covariation is artifactual (Dumont et al. 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.30]). In contrast to AD, SD can becontrolled experimentally in the field by keeping a fixed distance to animalsbefore recording FID (e.g., Møller 2012 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.61])or by recording SD as part of the approach protocol (Blumstein et al. 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.8]). The remainder of this chapter focuseson FID and the factors that account for variation in FID within and amongindividuals, populations, and species.Here I present an exhaustive review of research findings dealing with FID inbirds. I judge the magnitude of effects of the covariates by relying on effectsizes estimated in terms of Pearson product-moment correlation coefficientsbecause they have the intuitively simple property that the value squaresreflects the amount of variance explained (Cohen 1988[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.21]). I evaluate the strength ofrelationships between variables (preferably partial effects after adjustment forconfounding variables) judging than an r = 0.10, accounting for 1% of thevariance is small, r = 0.30, accounting for 9% of the variance is intermediate,and r = 0.50, accounting for 25% of the variance is a large effect (Cohen 1988[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.21]). These three levels can be comparedwith mean effect sizes in biology in general. Møller and Jennions (2002[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.67]) showed in a meta-analysis of allmeta-analyses in biology that, on average, main effects accounted for 5 to 7% ofthe variance, thus constituting an intermediate effect. Test statistics weretransformed into effect sizes using equations listed in Rosenthal (1994[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.82]). I also report sample size to allowreaders to estimate confidence intervals of the effect sizes. The effect sizesfor interspecific comparisons were generally based on phylogeneticallycontrolled analyses accounting for similarity among taxa due to commonphylogenetic descent, while intraspecific studies simply representedrelationships across individuals. A small number of studies could not beincluded because test statistics were not reported. I list all effect sizes andthe associated sample sizes in the electronic supplementary material, whilesummary statistics including weighted means and 95% confidence intervals fordifferent categories of effects are reported in Table 4.1[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#TBLm-tblw-7]. These estimates for categories ofeffects were derived from a non-phylogenetic, random effects meta-analysiscomparing effect sizes for different categories of studies using the MetaWin 2.1statistical software package (Rosenberg et al. 2000[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.83]). The main text of this chapter onlypresents some representative examples of effect sizes, while a complete list ofeffect sizes can be found in the electronic supplementary material. Finally,readers should note that Pearson product-moment correlations as a measure ofeffect size may not always be the most efficient way to estimate relationships,and other methods for judging relationships between pairs of variables have beensuggested (Koricheva et al. 2013 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.45]).Table 4.1 Summary statistics (mean effect size and 95% confidence intervals) fordifferent categories of phenotypic traits for flight initiation distance (FID)based on a non-phylogenetic random effects meta-analyses weighted by sample size(Rosenberg et al. 2000 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.83]).

In the review, I start out by investigating (1) the frequencydistributions of FIDs and their component parts. This part is based on a dataset that I have collected, which comprises 9007 observations belonging to 181species of European birds. Flight initiation distance was measured by having afixed SD around 30 m to avoid covariation between FID and SD. Data collectedfrom the same sites without the use of a fixed SD were very similar in terms ofFID. Then I analyze (2) the phenotypic variation in FID and its environmentaland genetic components, followed by (3) a summary of the different factorsaffecting FID, with a particular emphasis on life history because FID issquarely placed as the result of trade-offs between components of life history(Blumstein 2006 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.6]; Møller & Garamszegi 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.66]). I then (4) analyze underlyingassumptions linked to FID, such as its relationship with risk of predation anddeath, phenotypic adjustment related to predator avoidance, morphologicaladaptations, sensory organs related with (see also Chapter 12[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#CN-bp-12]), and their cognitive aspects. Next, I (5)investigate the population consequences of disturbance on FID, and I finish (6)by providing some ideas for future prospects of research.4.2 FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTIONS OF FIDUsing the raw data of 132 to 181 species of European birds (depending on whichstatistical moment was analyzed; N = 9007 observations) I evaluated thefrequency distributions of FID. I found that FID is characterized by a mean, andthe moments that reflect variance, skewness, and kurtosis. The characteristicsof the frequency distribution of FID are shown in Table 4.2[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#TBLm-tblw-8] and Figure 4.1[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#FIGm-fig-22]. There is considerable variation amongspecies with a coefficient of variation of 108.Table 4.2 Characteristics of mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of FID for132 to 181 (depending on variable) species of birds from Europe. N = 9007observations. Skewness and kurtosis were tested against the null hypothesis ofno significant difference from zero (i.e., the parameter-value expected assuminga normal distribution).MeanSDtNPMean13.4280.96181Variance100.091827.75159Skewness1.678.3019.07144<0.0001Kurtosis5.2649.4310.03132< 0.0001(A.

P. Møller. Sample size was 132 to 181 speciesdepending on the moment. The box plots show means (diamonds), medians,quartiles, 95% confidence intervals, and extreme observations.The frequency distributions of FID were significantly skewed toward the rightand deviated significantly from the expected value of zero for normaldistributions. In addition, there was significant leptokurtosis as reflected bythe mean kurtosis value across species being positive. Wright (1968[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.96]) showed, for the special case of adichotomous individual difference, that the degree of leptokurtosis reflectedthe ratio of the variances of the two distributions. Hence species on averagehaving leptokurtotic distributions imply that the overall population is composedof different subpopulations that differ inherently in degree of escape behavior.Thus the degree of leptokurtosis reflects heterogeneity in escape behavior amongindividuals, implying that a more heterogeneous population consists of moredifferent kinds of individuals in terms of escape behavior.4.3 FID AND COMPONENTS OF FLIGHTFlying animals such as birds, bats and aquatic organisms are unique by moving inthree dimensions, while all other organisms mainly move in two dimensions. Thishas important consequences for escape behavior (FID) because it is easier toescape in three than in two dimensions, since predators will have to pursue preythat can escape in one additional dimension. We should also expect that thehorizontal and vertical components of FID should show design features thatexploited these differences in escape propensity (Møller 2010b[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.60]). Every single FID can be decomposedinto its horizontal and vertical components, with the vertical component beingzero in organisms moving in two dimensions (Blumstein et al. 2004[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.11]; Fernández-Juricic et al. 2004[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.34]). In a comparative study of 69 speciesof birds, Møller (2010b [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.60]) showed thatfour times more variance in FID among species was due to the horizontal than thevertical dimension. The slope of the relationship between horizontal distanceand FID (horizontal slope) increased with body mass, whereas the slope for therelationship between vertical distance and FID (vertical slope) decreased withbody mass. In other words, large species rely more on the horizontal componentof escape than small species, and this may be caused by the higher energy costof flight in large species. The horizontal slope was negatively related to thevertical slope, albeit this negative relationship had a slope that was less thanexpected from a perfect trade-off. The horizontal slope decreased withincreasing density of the habitat from grassland over shrub to trees, while thatwas not the case for the vertical slope. If the vertical slope provides a meansfor avoiding predation, we should expect adult survival rate to decrease withincreasing vertical slope, which was indeed the case, while there was norelationship with the horizontal slope. In addition, species with a high rate ofsenescence had a high vertical slope, suggesting that an increase in verticalescape allowed for individuals of old age to accumulate due to the reduction inrisk of predation.4.4 SOURCES OF VARIATION IN FID4.4.1 WITHIN- AND AMONG-INDIVIDUAL VARIATIONThe variation within and among populations reflects differences among species(e.g., Blumstein et al. 2003 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.10]). In asample of 9289 FID estimates from Europe, 55% of the variance in FID occurredamong species (F = 59.83, d.f. = 186, 9103, P < 0.0001). A model of mean FIDweighted by sample size showed that 53% of the variance occurred among species(F = 195.53, d.f. = 1, 176, P < 0.0001). Thus more than half of the varianceoccurs among species with an almost similar fraction occurring within species.4.4.2 HERITABILITY, SELECTION, AND RESPONSE TO SELECTIONPhenotypic variance in FID can be partitioned into environmental and geneticcomponents, as well as gene × environment interactions (Falconer & Mackay 1996[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.32]). Repeatability sets an upper limit toheritability (Falconer & Mackay 1996 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.32]).Differences in FID among sites can be due to learning, sorting of phenotypes(differential migration of specific phenotypes to particular areas), or localadaptation. Repeatabilities of FID (calculated using intra-class correlationcoefficients; Falconer & Mackay 1996 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.32])were reported for five species, with all values except one being 0.76 to 0.92(Table 4.3 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#TBLm-tblw-9]). Four out of five studieshad significant repeatability. The exception was de Jong et al. (2013[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.26]) who showed an absence of significantrepeatability for breeding curlews (Numenius arquata, de Jong et al. 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.26]). Estimates of repeatability withinindividuals among years ranged from 0.37 to 0.62 in two species. I (unpublisheddata) estimated a repeatability of mean FID of 0.60 among individuals within181species from Europe (SE = 0.04), and a repeatability for the standarddeviation in FID among individuals within 159 species of 0.69 (SE = 0.12). Thisimplies that particular species are consistent in their mean and variance inFID.Table 4.3 Repeatability within and among years and habituation for FID indifferent species of birds.SpeciesRepeatability within yearsRepeatability amongyearsHabituationReferenceSomateria mollissima0.76–0.800.37–0.69NoneSeltmann etal. 2012 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.87]Athenecunicularia0.84–0.92_NoneCarrete & Tella 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.17]Athene cunicularia_0.85–0.91_Carrete &Tella 2013 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.19]Numenius arquata0.04__de Jonget al. 2013 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.26]Hirundo rustica0.920.62NoneA.P.

While some studies may suffer fromshort intervals between encounters resulting in individuals recognizing theexperimenter as not being dangerous, other studies have carefully controlled forsuch effects. The literature on habituation effects is clearly in need of ageneral review (Blumstein, 2014 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.7]).Broad sense heritability is the proportion of phenotypic variance due toadditive genetic effects (Falconer & Mackay 1996[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.32]). Only a single study has estimatedheritability for FID. Parent–offspring resemblance in the barn swallow provideda heritability of FID of 0.38 (0.07) for male parent–offspring and 0.46 (0.07)for female parent–offspring based on 191 individuals, and animal models providedsimilar estimates (Møller 2014a). Hence there is considerable additive geneticvariance in FID.Selection can be estimated as the change in standardized phenotype before andafter selection (Falconer & Mackay 1996[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.32]). Møller et al. (2013[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.71]) provided estimates of FID in residentand migratory birds before and after a severely cold winter along a latitudinalgradient in Europe. They provided evidence of a reduction in FID before andafter the cold winter, but only among resident species, and more so for ruralthan urban populations of the same species. This suggests that there has beendirectional selection on FID. Similarly, rapid change in FID between urban andrural populations of juncos (Junco hyemalis) suggests adaptation to an urbanenvironment (Atwell et al. 2012 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.2]).If FID is heritable, and if there is directional selection, we expect theresponse to selection will be the product of additive genetic variation andselection. Hence, FID should change across selection episodes when the trait isheritable. I am unaware of any animal model or other studies providing evidenceof such response to selection. In the scenario where we have prior estimates ofFID and animals are subjected to an extremely cold winter, we should expect areduction in FID after the cold winter, with the phenotype changing over timetoward the value recorded before the cold winter, if that original value wasclose to the optimum.4.5 BIOLOGICAL CAUSES OF VARIATION4.5.1 BODY SIZEIt is an almost trivial finding that body size is the best predictor of FID ininterspecific comparative analyses, because it is also the best predictor oflife history, anatomy, physiology, behavior, and conservation status (Bennett &Owens 2002 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.4]). Body size is also the bestintraspecific predictor of these characters in species with indeterminategrowth, such as fish, amphibians, and reptiles, but not in species withdeterminate growth such as birds and mammals (Bennett & Owens 2002[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.4]). Thus a larger flying animal takeslonger before take-off (Pennycuick 1989[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.76]), and I would thus expect longer FID inlarger species for this reason alone. Cooke (1980[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.22]) reported that smaller bird species weremore approachable in suburban than in rural areas. Blumstein (2006[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.6]) found an effect size of 0.21 for 150species of birds. Møller (2008b [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.56])reported an effect size equal to 0.64 for 100 species of European birds andGlover et al. (2011 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.39]) an effect size of0.77 for 28 species, while Weston et al. (2012[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.95]) reported an effect size of 0.69 for 138species of Australian birds. The allometry coefficient in Weston et al.’s studywas 0.29 and in that of Møller (2008b [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.56])0.27, respectively. These coefficients were smaller than isometry (which equalsa slope of 1; in the study by Møller 2008b[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.56] t = 24.33, d.f. = 97, P < 0.0001),implying relatively shorter FIDs for large-sized species. While the previouslyreported allometry coefficients are not phylogenetically controlled such ananalysis showed an even less steep slope of only 0.20 for FID in relation tobody mass in European birds (Møller 2008b[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.56]). Hence FID shows negative allometry(i.e., the allometry coefficient of 0.20 is positive but significantly smallerthan one). Thus large species have relatively shorter FID for their body size.4.5.2 LIFE HISTORYThe decision to flee represents a life history decision because individualstrade foraging efficiency, and hence energy gain, against disturbance and riskof predation. Therefore individuals should optimize their escape behaviorrelative to their residual reproductive value, which equals the average survivaland reproductive output of an individual of a given age (Roff 1992[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.81]). Thus individuals with low reproductiveoutput or survival prospects (e.g., because they are ill or suffer fromparasitism) should take greater risks than healthy conspecifics. Therefore lifehistory components are also expected to correlate with FID.Old age at first reproduction implies that individuals should take small risksin order not to die before the start of reproduction. Blumstein (2006[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.6]) showed a small effect size, as didMøller and Garamszegi (2012 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.66]) for meanand variance in FID.Clutch size and fecundity were negatively related to mean FID (Blumstein 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.6]; Møller & Garamszegi 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.66]). A study investigating the differencein FID and the difference in clutch size between temperate and tropicalpopulations showed a strong effect (Møller & Liang 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.68]), implying that paired designs thatautomatically control for confounding variables provide particularly strongeffects. Hatching success in curlews (Numenius arquata) peaked at intermediateFID (de Jong et al. 2013 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.26]), as would beexpected if long FID prevented efficient incubation. A similar line of argumentcan be used for a study by Seltmann et al. (2012[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.87]), which found longer incubation periodsin eiders (Somateria mollissima) with long FID. Interspecific studies ofdevelopmental periods only showed weakly related to FID with small effect sizes(Blumstein 2006 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.6]).Species with short and variable FID suffer less from disturbance and hence reacha state that allows reproduction more readily than individuals belonging tospecies with long and invariable FID. Accordingly duration of the breedingseason decreased with mean FID and increased with the variance in FID (Møller &Garamszegi 2012 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.66]).Both juvenile and adult survival rate increased with mean FID and decreased withvariance in FID (Møller & Garamszegi 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.66]), and this effect was mainly due to thevertical component of FID (Møller 2010b[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.60]). Therefore, I should expect thatlongevity and rate of senescence should be related to the vertical component inFID. Indeed, rate of senescence decreased with increasing mean and variance inFID, especially for the vertical component of escape (Blumstein 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.6]; Møller 2010b[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.60]; Møller & Garamszegi 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.66]). This means that individuals belongingto species that mainly escape in the vertical dimension age more slowly thanindividuals belonging to species that mainly escape in the horizontal dimension.4.5.3 URBANIZATIONUrbanization often results in a reduction in fearfulness of animals, and thisalso applies to FID (Blumstein 2014 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.7];Møller 2014a [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.63]). Cooke (1980[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.22]) described strong differences in FIDbetween suburban and rural populations of birds, and similar reports exist inthe older urbanization literature (Tomialojc 1970[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.93]; Klausnitzer 1985). Müller et al. (2013[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.73]) recently discovered in analyses ofcandidate genes in 12 paired populations of blackbirds (Turdus merula) that agene involved in harm avoidance differed strongly between urban and ruralpopulations. This implies that there has been divergence between populations dueto selection.Flight initiation distance has been known to relate to urbanization for morethan 30 years (Cooke 1980 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.22]). Themagnitude of the difference in FID between urban and rural populations isdirectly linked to time since urbanization (Møller 2008a[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.55]). Two studies suggest that both mean andvariance in FID relate to urbanization, apparently because a higher varianceimplies a greater diversity of phenotypes and hence more different behavioralphenotypes (or personalities) (Møller 2010a[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.59]; Carrete & Tella 2011a[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.18],b; Møller & Garamszegi 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.66]). Urban populations also had shorter FIDthan rural populations of the same species in a study of patterns of FID acrossEurope (Díaz et al. 2013 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.27]). Thedifference in FID between rural and urban populations decreased with increasinglatitude, paralleling trends in raptor abundance. The latitudinal trend alsoreflects the fact that the history of urbanization of birds is much older insouthern than in northern Europe.Flight initiation distance may play a crucial role in urbanization of birdsbecause relatively short FID will allow birds to coexist in the proximity ofhumans as shown in a paired comparison of urbanized and closely relatednon-urbanized species of birds (Møller 2009a[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.57]). If only a portion of the phenotypes inthe ancestral rural population with specific behavior first colonized urbanareas, we should expect an initial reduction in variance in FID, because somephenotypes did not enter cities. This should be followed by an increase invariance in FID as more different behavioral phenotypes develop in novel urbanhabitats to which urban birds only have adapted recently. These scenarios weresupported by independent studies comparing rural and urban birds in Europe andSouth America (Møller 2010a [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.59]; Carrete &Tella 2011a [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.18],b).Valcarcel and Fernández-Juricic (2009 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.94])tested the safe habitat hypothesis and found a strong relationship between FIDand habitat. There is also indirect evidence of predators affecting FID of preyin urban areas because many birds seek refuge near human habitation whereraptors are rare. In fact, there was a negative relationship between reductionin flight distance between rural and urban habitats and difference in FIDbetween predators and prey (effect size = 0.37) (Møller 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.61]). The difference in FID between preyspecies and that of their predator increased with the preference of prey speciesby sparrowhawks (Accipiter nisus) relative to their abundance (effect size =0.32) (Møller 2012 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.61]). Similarly, Guay etal. (2013 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.40]) recently reported that FIDwas longer when individual black swans (Cygnus atratus) were farther from water,which acted as a refuge. These findings fit well with the predominant role ofpredation in predicting urbanization of birds (Møller 2014b[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.62]).4.5.4 SONGMales generally compete more strongly for access to mates than females becausefemales are a limiting resource. Thus we should expect that displaying maleshave reduced FID compared to non-displaying conspecifics. This hypothesis hasbeen investigated by analyzing FID of singing males and males involved in otheractivities. Males mainly sing in order to attract mates or repel competitors. Asecond aspect of display that facilitates success is the height at whichindividuals display because high display sites facilitate transmission of song,but simultaneously expose individuals to predators.Singing males took greater risks than males that were not singing by reducingtheir FID with an effect size that was large (effect size = 0.47, N = 40)(Møller et al. 2008 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.69]). The difference inFID between singing and non-singing males was also related to greater songpost-exposure with a large effect size (effect size = 0.50, N = 34). Suchexposed display locations may increase the risk of predation. In contrast,sexual dichromatism was only weakly correlated with mean FID in singing males,with a small effect size (effect size = 0.05, N = 32) (Møller et al. 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.69]).4.5.5 HORMONES AND FIDTestosterone is the primary sex hormone in male vertebrates affecting sexualbehavior. Therefore high testosterone levels imply an increase in adoption ofrisky behavior. We might expect that FID would decrease in males relative tofemales during the breeding season, particularly so in species with hightestosterone levels. In a comparative analysis of European birds, P. Tryjanowskiand A. P. Møller (unpublished data) found that mean FID decreased withincreasing testosterone level (effect size = 0.45). The sex difference in FIDwas positively correlated with testosterone level (effect size = 0.54, N = 16).Finally, males are expected to have greater variance in FID than females becausemales should take greater mean risks, but also greater variance in risk thanfemales due to more intense competition for access to mates (Daly & Wilson 1983[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.24]). Indeed, the sex difference in variancein FID was negatively related to testosterone (effect size = 0.53, N = 18) in amodel that included the sex difference in body mass.These endocrinological findings may also suggest that other hormones, such ascorticosterone, could be involved in regulating FID. Indeed, Seltmann et al.(2012 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.87]) showed a positive correlationbetween FID and corticosterone levels in incubating eiders. And studies ofblackbirds have found lower testosterone and corticosterone levels in urbancompared to rural individuals (Partecke et al. 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.75], 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.74]), which is consistent with thehypothesis that hormones modulate risk taking and FID.4.5.6 HUNTING AND DISTURBANCEThere is an extensive literature on FID and hunting that shows that hunted birdstake flight earlier when approached by humans (Madsen 1995[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.50], 1998a[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.51], b[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.52]; Madsen & Fox 1995[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.53]; Weston et al. 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.95]). For example, Laursen et al. (2005[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.46]) showed a large effect (0.49) of huntingon FID across 19 species of waterbirds in Denmark. However, this literature isnot homogeneous. For example, Møller (2008a[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.55]) found no significant difference in FIDbetween hunted and other species in an analysis of 55 species of birds fromDenmark during the hunting season in a model that controlled for body mass(hunting effect size = 0.004). Likewise, there was little difference in FIDbetween inhabited and uninhabited areas in tropical China in an area withrelatively little hunting (Møller & Liang 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.68]).4.5.7 DIETThere are only a couple of studies of FID and diet. Carnivorous and omnivorousspecies of birds were more likely to be flighty than species with other diets(Blumstein 2006 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.6]). Blumstein suggests thatthis may reflect a carry-over effect; species that eat live prey may be moregenerally attuned to movement and may detect threats at a greater distance.Møller and Erritzøe (2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.64], 2014[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.65]) did not find evidence for specieseating mobile prey having different FIDs than species consuming immobile food.4.5.8 SOCIALITYStankowich and Blumstein (2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.89])conducted a meta-analysis of risk assessment in animals and found anintermediate-sized effect in most studies. Cooperative breeders were moreflighty than species with other breeding systems (Blumstein 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.6]). Laursen et al. (2005[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.46]) reported intermediate to large effectsizes for intraspecific relationships between FID and flock size in differentspecies of waterbirds with FID being longer for larger flocks. These findingsare inconsistent with dilution effects, because if each individual enjoyed asmaller risk we should then expect a shorter FID in larger flocks. In contrast,the results are consistent with effects of many eyes scanning for the presenceof a predator, although differences in phenotypic composition of differentlysized flocks may be an alternative explanation. Finally, effect sizes for theinterspecific relationship between FID and coloniality were all small (Møller2008a [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.55]).4.5.9 PREDATIONFlight initiation distance was negatively related to susceptibility to predationby sparrowhawks (Møller et al. 2008 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.69]).The difference in FID between urban and rural habitats was correlated withsusceptibility to sparrowhawk predation, supporting the previously mentionedsafe-habitat hypothesis (Møller 2008a [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.55]).An intraspecific study that used playback of predator calls showed a strongpositive effect of predator calls on increasing FID (Zanette et al. 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.97]). Likewise, another study showed thatthe abundance of mammalian predators has an intermediate positive effect on FIDin plover species (St. Clair et al. 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.84]). Hearing the call of a predator causedcrimson rosellas (Platycercus elegans) to reduce their FID (Adams et al. 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.1]). Finally, a study showed a relationshipbetween perch exposure and FID (Boyer et al. 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.13]).4.5.10 PARASITISMFlight initiation distance decreased both with diversity and prevalence of bloodparasites in birds, showing a small to intermediate effect. The difference inFID between singing and non-singing males increased strongly with prevalence ofPlasmodium that causes malaria (Møller et al. 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.69]). Independently, the difference in FIDbetween singing and non-singing males increased strongly with the concentrationof natural antibodies (Møller et al. 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.69]). Martín et al. (2006[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.54]) showed for chinstrap penguins(Pygoscelis antarctica) that FID decreased with strength of T-cell response,which reflects superior body condition.4.5.11 HABITATMost studies have shown intermediate to large effects of the relationshipbetween FID and habitat openness and habitat diversity, although Blumstein (2006[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.6]) found a small effect. In particular,variance in FID was related to being a habitat generalist. This finding isexpected because a greater diversity of behavioral phenotypes can exploit moredifferent habitats (Møller & Garamszegi 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.66]). Moreover, the horizontal component ofFID was more strongly related to habitat openness than the vertical component(Møller & Garamszegi 2012 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.66]).4.5.12 RANGE AND POPULATION SIZEFlight initiation distance decreased with increasing latitude (Díaz et al. 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.27]; Møller & Liang 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.68]). That was particularly the case inpaired comparisons investigating the difference in FID between temperate andtropical populations showing large effect sizes for both mean and variance inFID (Møller & Liang 2013 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.68]). Thesedifferences were linked to latitudinal differences in abundance or diversity ofpredators.Mean FID decreased and variance in FID increased with increasing range size(Møller & Garamszegi 2012 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.66]). Thus specieswith short and variable FIDs have large breeding ranges because thesecharacteristics allow high rates of reproduction and colonization of manydifferent habitats.Mean FID decreased and variance in FID increased with population size (Møller &Garamszegi 2012 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.66]). Population densityshowed quantitatively similar patterns (Lin et al. 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.49]; Møller & Garamszegi 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.66]).4.5.13 DISPERSALMean FID increased with natal dispersal distance. Variance in FID increased withdispersal distance in one study (Lin et al. 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.49]), but decreased with variance in FID inanother (Møller & Garamszegi 2012 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.66]).4.5.14 OVERALL ASSESSMENT OF EFFECT SIZES FOR DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF STUDIESEffect sizes for bivariate associations between FID and other variables weregenerally adjusted for allometry effects by the inclusion of body mass as anadditional predictor. Effect sizes were also generally adjusted for similarityin phenotype among species due to common phylogenetic descent, as reported inthe original publications. However, some studies did not remove effects of alertdistance and starting distance. This was because AD was not studied due todifficulties of estimating this parameter without error. Starting distance wascontrolled statistically in many studies, or it was controlled experimentally bykeeping SD fixed at approximately 30 m. I analyzed all effect sizes reported inthe electronic supplementary material using random effects meta-analysis thatrelies on Q-statistics that have F-distributions with numerator and denominatordegrees of freedom as in analyses of variance (Rosenberg et al. 2000[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.83]). The 186 effect size estimates variedconsiderably from −0.81 to +0.90 (see electronic supplementary material) with amean effect size of 0.30 (95% confidence intervals = 0.26, 0.34) in a randomeffects meta-analysis weighted by sample. Thus the mean effect size was of anintermediate magnitude, as is the common pattern in biology (Møller & Jennions2002 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.67]). Variation in individual effectsizes was slightly larger than expected due to sampling error (Qtotal = 242.10,df = 206, P = 0.0.043). The robustness of mean effects can be estimated from thenumber of null results required to eliminate the statistical significance of themean effect size, the so-called fail-safe number (Rosenberg et al. 2000[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.83]). Rosenthal’s fail-safe number of 21,793unpublished studies means that the significant mean effect size could notreadily be eliminated by unpublished studies. There was significantheterogeneity among categories of effect sizes (Table 4.1[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#TBLm-tblw-7]; Q = 58.79, df = 12, 194, P = 0.001).Nine out of 13 categories of effects were statistically significant by deviatingfrom zero (Table 4.1 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#TBLm-tblw-7]). These wereurbanization, body mass, predation, range, sociality, parasitism, disturbance,life history, and habitat. Effect sizes were large for urbanization and bodymass, explaining more than 25% of the variance. Range size, sociality,parasitism, disturbance, life history, and habitat had intermediate effects,while dispersal, sexual display, and brain size accounted for non-significant,but intermediate to small effects. There was no significant heterogeneity whencomparing intraspecific and interspecific studies (Q = 0.72, df = 1, 205, P =0.73). Likewise, there was no significant heterogeneity when comparing effectssizes based on mean FID and variance in FID (Q = 0.40, df = 1, 205, P = 0.56).In a meta-regression weighted by sample size I found a significant model thataccounted for 23% of the variance as estimated from the pseudo R2 (F = 5.64, df= 13, 193, P < 0.0001). This model fitted the data (F = 1.09, df = 7, 186, P =0.37). Significant predictors of effect size were category of effect (Table 4.2[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#TBLm-tblw-8]; F = 5.98, df = 12, 193, P < 0.0001) andmarginally whether the study was intraspecific or interspecific (F = 2.68, df =1, 193, P = 0.10; mean (SE) for intraspecific studies = 0.19 (0.05),interspecific studies = 0.26 (0.04)). Thus effect sizes differed amongcategories of characters and interspecific studies had larger effects thanintraspecific studies.4.6 ASSUMPTIONS4.6.1 FID REFLECTS PREDATION RISKAn inherent assumption underlying the estimation of risk-taking from FID is thatshorter FID translates into a greater risk of predation. While this assumptionmay intuitively appear likely, there are few tests of this assumption. Theassumption can be tested at both the level of individual risk and average riskacross populations or species. Møller (2014a) recorded FID for 2067 adult barnswallows from 1983 to 2012. Of these birds, 18 individuals were captured bypredators (domestic cats (Felis catus) or sparrowhawks). There was asignificantly shorter FID among de-predated individuals than survivors. There isalso evidence of mean FID of different species of birds reflecting risk ofpredation. Møller et al. (2008 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.69]) analyzedsusceptibility of 63 species of birds in Denmark to predation by sparrowhawks inrelation to mean FID, showing a negative relationship accounting for 13% of thevariance after adjusting for body mass and body mass squared (Figure 4.2[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#FIGm-fig-23]; effect size = 0.36). Predators preferprey of intermediate body size because such prey is easier to handle while stillproviding significant resources, hence explaining the inclusion of polynomialeffects of body mass. When mean flight distance for different species increasedfrom 6 to 60 m, susceptibility to sparrowhawk predation decreased by a factorten.[OEBPS_Images_image00918.jpeg]Figure 4.2Population trend of 115 different species of European breeding birds in relationto mean flight initiation distance. Size of symbols reflects sample size. Thepartial effect is F = 4.80, d.f. = 1, 113, P = 0.031).(Adapted from Møller 2008b [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.56])There are two experimental studies of the effects of perceived predation causedby real predators on FID of birds. Adams et al. (2006[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.1]) showed in playback experiments oncrimson rosellas that individuals responded to predator calls. Zanette et al.(2011 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.97]) provided direct experimentalevidence for FID being linked to risk of predation by either playing backpredator calls or control calls produced by species that are not predators ofsong sparrows (Melospiza melodia). This resulted in almost a tripling of FID inthe experimental group compared to controls, yielding a large effect size(0.55). Unfortunately this experiment did not allow for discrimination betweenphenotypic plasticity and phenotypic sorting as the underlying mechanism becauseindividuals were not tested with both treatments. Furthermore, the experimentdid not allow discrimination between effects of nest predation and predation onadults as a cause of the change in FID. However, the experiment providesunequivocal evidence for FID being causally linked to predation risk.An indirect test of the assumption that FID is related to risk of predation isbased on basal metabolic rate (BMR). Basal metabolic rate is the minimalmetabolic rate in the zone of thermoneutrality required for maintenance.Although many different factors may affect BMR, the fitness costs and benefitsin terms of the ability to respond to predators should affect BMR. In otherwords, BMR is a cost of being wary toward predators. Møller (2009a[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.57]) analyzed BMR and FID in 76 bird speciesand found that this positive relationship accounted for 27% of the variance(after inclusion of body mass as a confounding variable; effect size = 0.52).Inclusion of additional potentially confounding variables did not change thisconclusion, nor did similarity in phenotype among species due to commonphylogenetic descent. Therefore BMR is positively related to risk-takingbehavior, and predation is an important factor in the evolution of BMR. It alsosuggests that the large energy requirements seen in species with high BMR maylead individuals to take greater risks when foraging.4.6.2 MORPHOLOGICAL ADAPTATIONS TO FIDLocomotor efficiency depends on oxygen uptake and transport, large muscles, andappendages that facilitate flight. Møller et al. (2013[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.71]) predicted that hematocrit, which is ameasure of packed red blood cell volume and hence reflects efficiency of oxygentransport, would be the highest in species with short FID. Consistent with thisprediction, species with short FID had high hematocrit (effect size = 0.25).Flight initiation distance could vary with wing and hind limb morphology as theycan influence parameters associated with taking-off maneuvers (e.g.,acceleration and lift). For instance, in a study on 83 bird species controllingfor phylogenetic effects, FID was lower in species with rounded and convexwingtips perhaps due to the greater lift and thrust abilities compared tospecies with pointed and concave wingtips (Fernández-Juricic et al. 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.36]). However, the length of the femur andtarsus was not significantly correlated with FID (Fernández-Juricic et al. 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.36]). In addition, aspect ratio, whichreflects maneuverability during flight, was large in species with long FID(effect size = 0.39; Møller et al. 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.71]). Finally, FID increased with wing area,which reflects low costs of lifting a bird with a given body size (effect size =0.44). These effects were independent of potentially confounding variables(e.g., body size) and similarity due to common phylogenetic descent. Theseresults suggest that physiological and morphological adaptations to FID haveevolved as a means of reducing the costs of flight. Alternatively, species thathave evolved adaptations to efficient flight have subsequently evolved specificFID. Either way, this suggests that birds with low costs of flight do not awaitcloser approach by a potential predator to compensate for the costs of flight.4.6.3 SENSE ORGANSPrey rely on their sense organs for monitoring predators and adjustingantipredator behavior to level of risk. Thus well functioning eyes and ears arecrucial for escape behavior. An initial study found no significant relationshipbetween eye size and FID (Blumstein et al. 2004[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.11]), but a more comprehensive analysis byMøller and Erritzøe (2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.64]) analyzed eyesize in 97 species of birds in relation to FID, predicting that species withlarge eyes (i.e., higher ability to resolve visual details) will have relativelylonger FID as mediated by longer ADs. This effect size was intermediate (0.34).Visual acuity arises from an effect of eye size and retinal ganglion cells.However, the ability to focus on a predator will also depend on the size oflenses that is likely to mainly be adapted to efficient foraging. Lens size canbe broken down into effects of lens size and shape. Indeed, A. P. Møller and J.Erritzøe (unpublished data) weighed and measured the depth and width of lensesin 84 species of birds, showing that FID increased with the interaction betweenlens depth and lens diameter independent of eye size and body size. This impliesthat species with long FID had relatively thick and wide lenses in their eyesindependent of eye size.Just as visual information may be crucial for monitoring the behavior ofpredators, auditory information may independently of visual information play asignificant role in predator–prey interactions. The tympanic membrane is crucialfor hearing and a relatively larger tympanic membrane for a given body sizeimplies better hearing ability (A. P. Møller & J. Erritzøe unpublished data).Across 37 species of birds, FID was strongly positively related to the size ofthe tympanic membrane (effect size = 0.74). Likewise, the relationship betweenthe size of the tympanic membrane and the footplate (the flat portion of thestapes, which is set into the oval window of the medial wall of the inner ear)implies better hearing ability, and again there was a significant positiverelationship between FID and tympanic membrane/footplate (effect size = 0.35, N= 37). These aspects of sensory ecology for eyes and ears are treated in greaterdetail in Chapter 12 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#CN-bp-12].4.6.4 BRAINS AND COGNITIONBrains and cognition should play a role in predator–prey interactions becauseprey glean information on the whereabouts and predator behavior with senseorgans (Chapter 12 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#CN-bp-12]). Information acquiredby the sense organs is processed by the brain, and this information subsequentlymay change an individual’s behavior. A large number of studies have investigatedthe ecological and evolutionary causes of brain size evolution.This approach has recently been criticized for being superficial andnon-scientific (Healy & Rowe 2007 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.41]). Likeall scientific enquiry this avenue of research is based on carefully recordedobservations on brain size or size of component parts of the brain, and numerousattempts to verify the reliability of such data have shown a high degree ofconsistency, even in comparisons of head volume with brain size (Møller et al.2011 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.70]). Surprisingly, Healy and Rowe(2007 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.41]) have not themselves adhered tosuch approaches in their own research by testing for reliability of their brainsize data or adopting rigorous phylogenetic analyses, and they have based theiranalyses on small and heterogeneous sample sizes.Guay et al. (2013 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.40]) in an analysis of 27bird species from Australia found no significant association between brain sizeand FID. Although a relatively larger brain (corrected for body mass) may allowfor longer FID because of faster reaction to a potential predator, a largerbrain may also allow assessment of the intentions of the predator and thelikelihood of attack before fleeing. This scenario implies that visualinformation is gleaned by the eyes, processed by the brain and eventually usedfor making decisions about FID, with these decisions depending on the relativesize of the brain (Møller & Erritzøe 2014[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.65]). Indeed, in a sample of 107 birdspecies FID increased with relative eye size (effect size = 0.33), but decreasedwith relative brain size (effect size = -0.23). In other words, species withrelatively larger brains for a given body size stayed put for longer beforetaking off. Møller and Erritzøe (2014 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.65])hypothesized that this relationship came about by species with relatively largebrains for a given body size using this “extra” time for monitoring theintentions of the predator before taking off. Furthermore, FID increasedindependently with size of the cerebellum, which plays an important role inmotor control (effect size = 0.37, N = 54). These findings are consistent withcognitive monitoring as an antipredator behavior that does not result in thefastest possible escape, but rather the least expensive escape flight thatallows for monitoring of predator behavior. Indeed, attentional monitoring costshave been hypothesized to be one cost of monitoring predators (Blumstein 2010;Cooper & Blumstein 2013 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.23]; Møller &Erritzøe 2014 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.65]). Information assessmentin the interaction between predators and prey may depend on the behavior of theapproaching predator. Birds significantly increased their FID or AD whenapproaching humans looked directly at them rather than elsewhere, as reported byEason et al. (2006 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.31]) for American robins(Turdus migratorius), Bateman and Fleming (2011[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.3]) for hadeda ibises (Bostrychia hagedash),Clucas et al. (2013 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.20]) for American crows(Corvus brachyrhynchos) and Lee et al. (2013[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.47]) for magpies (Pica pica). Hadeda ibisesin addition reduced the FID when approached quickly rather than slowly by ahuman (Bateman & Fleming, 2011 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.3]), althougha study of galahs (Cacatua roseicapilla) only showed a small effect (effect size= 0.017, N = 50; Cárdenas et al. 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.16]).Thus many bird species can distinguish between potential predators intentlylooking at a prey individual and those only looking intermittently.Cars are useful tools for assessing cognitive abilities of birds in relation torisk. Recently, birds were shown to adjust their FID to road speed limits byincreasing FID as speed limit increases, while there was no similar effect ofthe speed of the vehicle as such (Legagneux & Ducatez 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.48]). This response may reduce the risk ofcollision and decrease mortality. In a second study, Mukherjee et al. (2013[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.72]) showed that American crows (Corvusbrachyrhynchos) adjusted their risk-taking behavior to the driving direction ofcars in a particular lane. Thus crows in the opposite lane to that used by anapproaching vehicle stayed put. Additionally, whereas a fifth of crows walkedfrom the driving lane to the safe opposite lane, none walked in the oppositedirection. These observations imply that birds are able to assess driving speedand direction, and use this information to reduce risk of collision.A different way of assessing the effects of cognitive abilities on FID is todetermine FID when birds are either approached directly by a human or approachedtangentially at a fixed distance. Geist et al. (2005[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.38]), Fernández-Juricic et al. (2005[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.35]), Heil et al. (2007[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.43]) and Bateman and Fleming (2011[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.3]) showed that birds could distinguishthese two kinds of approaches. Møller and Tryjanowski (2014) collected similardata for a large number of bird species in paired populations of rural and urbanspecies. Birds were better able to assess the direction of approach by humans inrural than in urban habitats, apparently because rural birds are more oftenconfronted with human disturbance even at long distances between humans andbirds. Thus birds in urban habitats already have very short FID, making it lessbeneficial to distinguish between direct and tangential approaches.While prey usually flee in the opposite direction of an approaching predator,there is considerable variation in flight direction among individuals, with someeven directly approaching the predator (Domenici et al. 2011a[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.28], b[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.29]). Møller (unpublished manuscript)estimated the angle of flight when recording FID, showing considerable moreescapes around directions of 90° and 270° than expected by chance. Such escapesare basically escapes from the direction at which a potential predator (in thiscase a human) is approaching, resulting in energy savings by the bird. Theproportion of individuals escaping at angles of 90° and 270° in 84 species ofbirds increased with brain size (effect size = 0.25), decreased with body mass(effect size = 0.38) and increased with urbanization (effect size = 0.46). Adifferent way of adjusting flight to disturbance is to run away rather than fly.Rodriguez-Prieto et al. (2008a [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.80]) showedfor blackbirds (Turdus merula) exposed to frequent disturbance by humans fled onfoot, rather than engaging in potentially expensive flight.4.7 POPULATION CONSEQUENCESThe individual consequences of frequent disturbance and the resulting flights toevade risk of predation are not well known. However, the high metabolic cost ofshort flights can be considerable. Tatner and Bryant (1986[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.91]) measured costs of short flights typicalfor human disturbance of the European robin (Erithacus rubecula) using doublylabeled water. This species is common in forests, but also in urban habitatsincluding gardens throughout Europe, and hence humans disturb robins at a highrate. The flight costs were extremely high at 23 times basal metabolic rate,implying that they could have consequences for reproduction and during coldspells even survival. Because robins typically have short FIDs (mean = 5.9 m, SD= 2.9 m, N = 247, A. P. Møller unpublished data), the flight costs estimated byTatner and Bryant (1986 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.91]) can beconsidered biologically relevant. Robins living in urban areas may be disturbedby humans, dogs, and cats numerous times per day with the consequence ofsignificant energetic costs. Therefore it is reasonable to ask whether frequentshort FIDs have population consequences. Indeed, some hypotheses predict changesin habitat/patch use based on the frequency of disturbance (e.g., number ofdisturbance events per day; Fernández-Juricic 2002[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.33]; Frid & Dill 2002[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.37]).Costly defensive strategies can reduce population density of animals throughindirect effects (Bolnick & Preisser 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.12]; Preisser et al. 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.77]). The population consequences of FIDscan be investigated by relying on extensive monitoring efforts by amateurornithologists across Europe (Møller 2008b[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.56]), but also in other continents. We mayexpect species with long FIDs for their body size to show declining populationtrends because humans disturb such species more often. Among 56 species ofEuropean birds, FID accounted for 33% of the variance in population trend witheffect sizes ranging from 0.36 to 0.58 in different analyses. Therefore specieswith long FIDs for their body size had declining populations while species withshort FIDs had increasing populations. That was also the case when controllingstatistically for potentially confounding effects that are known to account forpopulation trends such as migration distance, latitude, farmland, and brainsize. Thaxter et al. (2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.92]) analyzedpopulation trends in the UK in relation to predictors, but found no significanteffect of FID. The reason for this difference in conclusions between the twostudies remains unknown. However, stronger effects of brain size on populationtrends in birds in North-Western Germany, compared to an area from EasternGermany to the Czech Republic, have shown that effects can be context dependent(Reif et al. 2011 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.79]). It is possible thatbird populations have evolved shorter FIDs in countries with higher humanpopulation density, such as in the UK, and that such shorter FIDs reduce theimpact of human disturbance. The apparent lack of a significant effect of FID onpopulation trends in the UK also implies that the effect is stronger in othercountries since the European population trend is based on trends in differentcountries weighted by the size of the country. The Thaxter et al. (2010[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.92]) study had some shortcomings: they didnot use FID data obtained in the UK, nor did they weight their analyses bysample size, which is required because estimates of FID differ in precisiondepending on sample size, nor did they report the effect size from theiranalyses.A more detailed way of investigating the relationship between population trendand FID is to analyze trend and FID data for different countries. Díaz et al.(2013 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.27]) analyzed 329 populations withinformation on both variables in the same country and found a strong negativecorrelation between population trend and FID. That was even the case whenconfounding variables such as migration distance, body mass, and brain mass wereincluded in the models.These findings raise the possibility that FID can be a useful tool inconservation including assessment of levels of disturbance and susceptibility todisturbance (Madsen 1995 [OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.50], 1998a[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.51], b[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.52]; Tarlow & Blumstein 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.90]; Weston et al. 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.95]; see also Chapter 17[OEBPS_Text_part0032.xhtml#CN-bp-17]).4.8 FUTURE PROSPECTSThere are numerous open research questions dealing with the causes andconsequences of variation in avian FID. Many predator communities are dynamicwith rapid spatial and temporal changes. That is, for example, the case withcyclical populations of predators, population declines caused by DDT and otherpesticides, and urban environments being colonized by raptors. Such changes inrisk of predation should have predictable consequences for risk-taking behaviorand hence FID. Islands are interesting laboratories because communities ofanimals typically are impoverished, and predators are often rare or evencompletely absent (Blumstein & Daniel 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#REFe-r-4.8]). It would be interesting to compare FIDof island and mainland bird populations of the same species. Likewise, it wouldbe interesting to investigate FID on islands without mammalian, but with avian,predators. Such situations could potentially be used to make crosses betweenpopulations of prey species with and without predators, thereby testing theprediction that crosses should have intermediate FIDs between those of the twoparental populations. Furthermore, there are no studies testing whether FIDvaries with respect to the location of predator nests or roosts. Is it the casethe prey that live close to the nest of a raptor adjust their FID to thepresence of predators by behaving more cautiously or more frequently use refugesto reduce the risk of predation? Finally, there is a need for studies of thefitness consequences of FID for banded individuals with a focus on risk ofpredation and reproductive success.REFERENCESAdams, J. L., Camelio, K.

Cooper, Jr.5.1 INTRODUCTIONPredator–prey encounters matching the scenario of optimal escape theory begin intwo ways. Upon detecting an approaching predator, lizards and other reptilesthat are moving often stop, presumably reducing the probability of beingdetected by the predator. Those that are immobile remain still for the samereason as they monitor approaching predators. A large majority of studies offlight initiation distance (FID) and other escape variables have reportedeffects of predation risk factors, which are important because they affect thecost of not fleeing. Although fewer studies report effects of factors thatimpose opportunity costs (i.e., costs of not fleeing), much of what is knownabout these effects has been learned in studies of lizards. Effects of theinitial fitness of lizards and other reptiles on escape behavior have beenstudied only indirectly.Reptiles are one of the three taxonomic groups in which escape behavior has beenstudied most extensively, the others being birds and mammals (Stankowich &Blumstein 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.104]; Chapter 3[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#CN-bp-3]; Chapter 4[OEBPS_Text_part0015.xhtml#CN-bp-4]). Although advances in our understanding ofphylogenetic relationships among major vertebrate taxa has removed crocodiliansfrom Reptilia, and the placement of turtles on the vertebrate phylogenetic treeremains uncertain, the traditional taxonomic categories of reptiles are coveredin this chapter, primarily because herpetologists continue to study thesegroups. Because little is known about escape decisions by turtles, crocodilians,and snakes, most of this chapter presents current knowledge about escape bylizards. Snakes constitute a major lizard clade, but their escape behavior ispresented separately because they differ ecologically and morphologically fromother lizards.Factors affecting decisions about when and how far to flee are the main focus,including factors that affect predation risk and cost of fleeing. The directionof fleeing in relation to predators and refuges, and the selection of and entryinto refuges are also discussed. Effect sizes are correlation coefficients takenfrom the original studies or calculated from P values and sample sizes or otherstatistics using the Meta-Analysis Calculator. Values are mean ± SE. Manycitations have been omitted from the text, but are available in the electronicsupplementary material (ESM 5.1) along with a table of effects, effect sizes,taxa, and sources (ESM 5.2). These are available atwww.cambridge.org/9781107060548 [http://www.cambridge.org/9781107060548].Information about alternative escape strategies is presented in concludingsections for lizards and snakes.5.2 LIZARDS5.2.1 PREDATION RISK FACTORS THAT AFFECT ESCAPE DURING APPROACH5.2.1.1 POSITION, HABITAT, AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS5.2.1.1.1 DISTANCE TO REFUGE, PERCH HEIGHT, AND DIRECTION TO REFUGEMany lizards escape by running to and entering refuges, most commonly trees,logs, crevices in rocks, and animal burrows (Cooper 1998a[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.17]). Fleeing lizards may stop on thesurface or enter a refuge; many individuals stop very close to a refuge,avoiding costs of refuge use if the predator does not attack. The distance tothe nearest refuge and its direction with respect to the approaching predatordetermine projected arrival times of predator and prey at the refuge (Cooper1997a [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.15]; Kramer & Bonenfant 1997[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.72]). Because arrival time increases asdistance to refuge increases, risk of being captured at a particular FIDincreases as distance to refuge increases. Therefore FID is predicted byeconomic escape theory to increase as distance to refuge increases. If lizardsfarther from a refuge are more likely than those adjacent to a refuge to stopbefore entering a refuge, distance fled (DF) will be shorter than distance to arefuge, but is likely to be longer than for lizards closer to a refuge for tworeasons. First, lizards that remain outside a refuge must move far enough fromthe predator to provide a margin of safety in the event of continued approach.Second, distance fled by lizards close to a refuge must often be less than themargin of safety.Lizards closer to a refuge initially are expected to permit closer approachbefore fleeing and are more likely to enter a refuge than those farther from arefuge. The predator’s proximity when escape begins implies greater risk ofbeing captured should the prey not enter a refuge. Therefore when distance to arefuge is shorter, the probability of entering a refuge is predicted to begreater.In all of 17 studies of ten lizard species representing five families, FIDincreased as distance to refuge increased (Figure 5.1[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#FIGm-fig-24]). The effect size (r = 0.49 ± 0.06,range 0.16–0.93) was intermediate. The primary determinant of the effect size islikely to be the degree of variation in distance to refuge among individuals.The influence of distance to refuge on FID may be somewhat stronger thanindicated by the mean effect size because the range of distance to refuge wassmall in some cases (Cooper & Wilson 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.50]). In some species that occur at highlyvariable distances from refuge, the effect size is large (Anolis lineatopus: r =0.93, Cooper 2006a [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.23]; Egernia cunninghami:r = 0.90, Eifler 2001 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.61]; and Leiocephaluscarinatus: r = 0.87, Cooper 2007a [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.25]).[OEBPS_Images_image00919.jpeg]Figure 5.1As distance to refuge increases, FID increases in Sceloporus woodi.(Stiller & McBrayer 2013 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.107])Two of the lowest r values were taken from a study in which the method ofapproach differed from that in all other studies (Bulova 1994[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.9]). Bulova walked through the habitat in astraight line, and did not stop upon sighting a lizard, but continued on herpath. Researchers in the remaining studies walked through the habitat untilsighting a lizard, stopped moving, turned toward the lizard, and then walkeddirectly toward it. In the only direct comparison of the effect size for the twomethods, the effect sizes for Callisaurus draconoides were 0.16 in Bulova’sstudy and 0.47 in Cooper (2010a [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.32]).Variation in directness of approach using Bulova’s method may have affectedperceived risk, which is lower for indirect approaches. Because shorter FID ispredicted for lower risk, the association between FID and distance to refugewould be weakened by including indirect approaches.Distance to refuge is positively correlated with distance fled in all of tenstudies of species from five families, significantly so in eight of them (r =0.49 ± 0.09, range 0.12–0.91). Reasons for the large differences in effect sizeare not entirely clear, but include the difference in method of approachdiscussed above and interspecific differences in degree of variation in distancefrom refuge. In the only study to measure the relationship between distance torefuge and the probability of entering refuge when approached, a largerproportion of lizards entered refuge when closer than farther from refuge (r =0.56, Cooper 2007a [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.25]). The relationshipsof distance fled and probability of entering refuge to distance to refuge are aspredicted by economic escape theory.For lizards on tree trunks and other surfaces having vertical aspects, perchheight strongly affects vulnerability to predation by terrestrial predators.Many species flee up trees to reach heights where they are safe and often fleeto and along the side of the tree opposite that of the approaching predator,where their movements are invisible. Therefore perch height is expected to haveeffects on escape behavior similar to those of distance to refuge. For speciesthat climb upward to escape, predation risk is greatest at perch height (PH) =0. As a lizard climbs higher, its risk of predation decreases until it attains aheight at and above which predation risk is zero and fleeing is unnecessary.Flight initiation distance should therefore decrease as PH increases in therange 0 ≤ PH ≤ PH0risk). Distance fled (climbed) should increase as PH decreasesin the range 0 ≤ PH ≤ PH0risk, but should be unaffected at higher PH. Whenapproached directly, all lizards at risk should flee before the predator reachesthe tree.Fewer species may flee downward from terrestrial or aerial predators. Forexample, grass-bush anoles (Anolis spp.) occupy low bushes that do not permitupward escape from terrestrial predators large enough to reach the tops of thebushes (Williams 1983 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.112]). These speciesflee downward, often into low vegetation on the ground (Cooper 2006b[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.24], 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.37]). Other species escape upward when onvertical surfaces that are tall enough to permit escape, but flee downward oronto shorter vertical objects such as fence posts (Schneider et al. 2000[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.93]). When prey flee downward, predationrisk is lowest on the ground and increases as PH increases. Economic escapetheory predicts that FID increases as PH increases when escape is downward.Distance fled also is expected to increase as PH above ground increases.Predictions for FID have been confirmed consistently. In all of 13 species thatflee upward, including representatives of five families, FID increased as PHdecreased (Figure 5.2 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#FIGm-fig-25]). The effect sizeis similar to that of distance to refuge (absolute value of r = −0.50 ± 0.07,range 0.12–0.88). For three species of Anolis that fled downward, FID increasedas PH increased (r = 0.36 ± 0.13, range 0.27–0.50). Although the absolutemagnitudes of the effect sizes for lizards that escape upward and downward aresimilar, the effects are in opposite directions. The escape responses of lizardsthat fled upward differed from those of species that escaped by fleeing downward(Fisher exact test, p = 0.0036, two-tailed). Distance fled decreased as PHincreased in the sole species studied, which escaped upward. However, therelationship was weak and not significant. The range of PH in which someindividuals flee and others do not presumably reveals individual differences inboldness or wariness (López et al. 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.77]).[OEBPS_Images_image00920.jpeg]Figure 5.2As perch height increases, FID decreases in Anolis graham.(Cooper 2010b [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.33])Prey sometimes flee to nearby refuges that may be in any direction, including inthe direction of the predator. When a prey flees toward an approaching predator,it has less time to reach refuge ahead of the predator than when it flees away(Kramer & Bonenfant 1997 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.72]). In one lizardspecies both FID (r = 0.55) and DF (r = 0.54) are longer when a prey flees to arefuge toward rather than away from the predator. The finding for FID matchesthe prediction based on greater risk of fleeing toward a predator. The longer DFfor prey approaching predators suggests that the lizards may flee longerdistances to reach secure refuges, flee all the way to refuge, or a higherproportion of the distance to refuge, when fleeing toward versus away from thepredator, or that they flee toward the predator when alternative refuges areunavailable nearby. In another species when the predator is between the prey andrefuge, FID is longer when the prey flees away from the predator (r = 0.62);lizards delay fleeing when the refuge is blocked, often fleeing toward, butaround the predator at an acute angle (Cooper 1999a[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.20]).5.2.1.1.2 MICROHABITATEscape behavior may differ among microhabitats for multiple reasons, includingdifferences in distance to refuge, detectability, and effects of substrate onrunning speed. Lizards that escape by climbing typically have a shorter distanceto flee to safety when on trees than on other substrates, and are thereforepredicted to have shorter FID and shorter DF. In the skink Plestiodon laticepsFID (r = 0.57 ± 0.05) and DF (r = 0.35 ± 0.03, range 0.32–0.37) were longer andlikelihood of entering refuge was lower (r = 0.46 ± 0.02, range 0.44 – 0.48) forlizards on rocks and ground than on trees (r values for two studies each)(Cooper 1998a [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.17]). Similar effects wereobserved in the phrynosomatid Sceloporus virgatus (Cooper & Wilson 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.50]), for which FID (r = 0.79 ±.13, range =0.65–0.92) and DF (r = 0.35 ± 0.09, range 0.26–0.45) were shorter for lizards ontrees than on ground or rocks (two studies each). These findings are in part anextension of the results for perch height to situations in which prey must fleeto a tree to attain zero PH.5.2.1.1.3 HABITAT OPENNESS AND EXPOSUREIn habitats or microhabitats where lizards are more detectable or morevulnerable to attack, lizards are expected to be warier, which may be expressedby longer FID and DF, increased tendency to flee, and/or increased likelihood ofentering refuge. Such effects have been investigated by comparing escape bylizards in habitats that differ in vegetative cover, when individuals in thesame habitat are exposed versus partially concealed, in circumstances thataffect their conspicuousness due to background matching and movement, and inmicrohabitats that differ in safety.In open, sparsely vegetated habitats, prey may have longer FID and DF becausethey tend to be farther from refuges and are more detectable. Flight initiationdistance was longer in open than densely vegetated habitats in four species; intwo other species, FID was longer in open habitats in one of two studies. Forall comparisons combined, the effect size is modest (0.37 ± 0.12), but quitevariable (range 0.00–0.93), with only two values above 0.33.Lizards fled longer distances in more open habitats in five of six comparisonsin four species; in one of these species no effect was observed in one of twocomparisons. The effect size for all comparisons was small (r = 0.25 ± 0.07). Ina comparative study of 25 species of Liolaemus, DF was longer in more open thanless open habitats (Schulte et al. 2004[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.94]).In all of six species from four families, FID was shorter for partiallyconcealed than fully exposed lizards. The importance of partial concealment forrisk assessment is suggested by the large effect size (r = 0.73 ± 0.05, range0.54–0.85). In two species exposed lizards were more likely to flee than werepartially concealed lizards (r = 0.57 ± 0.14, range 0.43–0.71).5.2.1.1.4 TEMPERATUREBody temperature strongly affects running speed in lizards (Huey 1982[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.68]). At cold temperatures they areimmobilized or move very slowly, but running speed increases as body temperatureincreases until high speed is maintained over a range of body temperatures nearthe preferred body temperature (Huey 1982[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.68]). Because escape ability improves andrisk when a predator is at a given distance decreases as running speedincreases, prey are predicted to have shorter FID as body temperature increases.However, if cooler lizards stay closer to refuge or rely more on immobility toavoid being detected, FID might increase as body temperature increases or beunaffected by body temperature if the effects of temperature on speed anddistance to refuge and/or crypsis via immobility counteract each other.Few studies have reported effects of body temperature on escape behavior becauselizards must be captured immediately after fleeing to measure body temperature,whereas air temperature and substrate temperature are easy to measure. Bodytemperature is more highly correlated with substrate temperature than with airtemperature. Due to the weaker correlation of air and substrate temperature thanbody temperature with running speed (Hertz et al. 1983[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.66]), predictions are less clear than forbody temperature.Flight initiation distance increased as body temperature decreased (Figure 5.3[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#FIGm-fig-26]) in three species (r = 0.52 ± 0.10,range 0.39–0.72) and increased as body temperature increased in two otherspecies (r = 0.44 ± 0.11). In two species the proportion of lizards that fledincreased as body temperature increased (r = 0.92 ± 0.04, range 0.88–0.97).Flight initiation distance increased as substrate temperature increased in twostudies of one species (r = 0.63 ± 0.09, range 0.54–0.72) and decreased assubstrate temperature increased in another species (r = 0.39). Substratetemperature was uncorrelated with distance fled in two species.[OEBPS_Images_image00921.jpeg]Figure 5.3As body temperature increases, FID decreases in Sceloporus virgatus.(Cooper 2011c [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.36])Air temperature, being weakly related to body temperature, is often unrelated orweakly related to escape variables. In four species FID was unrelated to airtemperature. In two species FID increased as air temperature increased (r = 0.16± 0.00, range 0.16–0.17), and in four species FID decreased as air temperatureincreased (r = 0.35 ± 0.09, range 0.21–0.57). In five of seven species, distancefled was unrelated to air temperature; in the other two species distance fledincreased as air temperature increased (r = 0.22 ± 0.06, range 0.16–0.27). Theproportion of lizards that fled increased at air temperature increased in asingle species (r = 0.79). The proportion of individuals that entered refugedecreased as air temperature increased in all four studies of three species (r =0.65 ± 0.15, range 0.28–1.0).As expected, effect sizes for air temperature were smaller than for bodytemperature and substrate temperature. Temperature profoundly affects manyaspects of behavior in ectotherms such as lizards, including all four escapevariables examined. As suggested above, differences among species in thedirection of the relationships of temperature to FID and DF may indicate thatsome species may stay closer to refuges when cool, whereas others do not adjustdistance to refuge to current temperatures.5.2.1.1.5 WIND SPEEDBulova (1994 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.9]) reasoned that high windspeed reduces body temperature, which in turn reduces running speed. Shepredicted that FID and DF would increase as wind speed increased to compensatefor slower running. In one of two species in her study, FID decreased as windspeed increased (r = – 0.13), but wind speed did not affect DF. In the otherspecies FID was unrelated to wind speed, but DF increased as wind speedincreased (r = 0.26). These small effects might be indirect effects ofenvironmental correlates of wind speed. That the direction of the effect of windspeed on FID was opposite to that predicted hints that lizards might be harderto detect in windy conditions.5.2.1.1.6 TIME OF DAY AND SEASONTime of day affected neither FID nor DF in the agamid Lophognathus temporalis(Blamires 1999 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.4]). Presumably, behavioralthermoregulation suffices to maintain body temperature in a narrow rangethroughout the day, obviating any effect of diel variation in temperature onrunning speed.5.2.1.2 PREY TRAITS5.2.1.2.1 PREY SPEED, MORPHOLOGY, AND BODY CONDITIONBecause faster prey can reach refuge sooner or outrun predators, FID ispredicted to decrease as prey speed increases. Distance fled is predicted toincrease as running speed increases provided that lizards often flee withoutentering refuge and running speed does not affect duration of fleeing. Usingmorphological correlates of running speed, the prediction for FID was verifiedfor one test and contradicted for another test in the same species (Hawlena etal. 2009 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.65]). That FID increased as taillength decreased (r = 0.34) is readily interpretable as an effect of decreasingrunning speed as tail length decreases (see section 5.2.1.2.4[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#D-sec-12]). However, FID increased as relative hindlimb length increased (r = 0.48), contradicting the predicted effect of longerhind limb length to increase running speed. Hawlena et al. (2009[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.65]) noted that running speed may beunimportant for escape by Podarcis lilfordi, which historically experienced verylow predation pressure before human beings arrived in the Balearic Archipelagoand currently experience very little predation in the population studied. Theselizards typically stay close to vegetation that provides cover. Additionalstudies are needed to directly examine the effect of running speed on FID inlizard populations subject to higher levels of predation.Morphological correlates of running speed and stride length were examined byLosos et al. (2002 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.79]) in 17 cordylidspecies. Distance fled increased as femur length increased (r = 0.76) and asspine length increased (r = 0.75). These large interspecific effects areconsistent with the prediction that DF increases as running speed increases.Prey in better body condition have greater expected fitness than those in poorercondition. The asset protection principle states that prey with larger assetswill be more cautious in their defense (Clark 1994[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.13]). Escape theory therefore predicts thatprey having better body condition have longer FID. In a single species FIDincreased as body condition improved (r = 0.57), as predicted. This testconfirms the prediction for initial fitness, one of the three major componentsthat determine FID in optimal escape theory (Cooper & Frederick 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.40]). Further tests of indicators of fitnessare needed to assess the general validity of the prediction.5.2.1.2.2 HABITUATIONWhen potential predators are present frequently or for long periods, but do notattack, prey may assess the threat of predation to be low, i.e., they may becomehabituated. Lizards in populations frequently exposed to people are predicted tohave shorter FIDs than in populations infrequently exposed. Even if predationrisk is high, prey that are constantly exposed to predators must accept greaterrisk if they are to perform essential activities such as foraging and socialbehavior. Both risk allocation (Lima & Bednekoff 1999[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.75]) and habituation predict that FID willbe shorter where predators are frequently or constantly present. Nevertheless,habituation is the likely explanation for decreased FID when the predatorsrarely or never attack because predation risk is very low, which is not the caseunder the risk allocation hypothesis, and because some prey become so habituatedthat they allow themselves to be touched (Cooper, personal observations).In all of eleven lizard species from six families, FID was shorter in habituatedthan unhabituated populations (Figure 5.4[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#FIGm-fig-27]). The effect size of habituation wassubstantial (r = 0.50 ± 0.06) and variable (range 0.16–0.73). It is expected tovary with the difference in degree of exposure to human beings among pairs ofpopulations. All findings are consistent with the interpretation that FID isshorter in populations where lizards are habituated to people.[OEBPS_Images_image00922.jpeg]Figure 5.4In Anolis lineatopus, FID is shorter where lizards are habituated to humanpresence.(Cooper 2010b [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.33])5.2.1.2.3 PREY SEX, AGE, AND BODY SIZEEconomic escape theory makes no general predictions about sex differences.However, if ecological or morphological differences between sexes affectpredation risk, the sex at greater risk is predicted to be warier. Flightinitiation distance has been reported separately for the sexes in 38 speciesfrom eight families. Flight initiation distance was longer in males than femalesin eight species and in one of three populations in a ninth (r = 0.30 ± 0.08,range 0.20–0.42 for cases in which a difference was detected), whereas FID waslonger in females than males in three species and in one of six populations of afourth species (r = 0.22 ± 0.06, range 0.08–0.35). Males had longer FID thanfemales in all three lacertid species studied (Figure 5.5[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#FIGm-fig-28]), but no other relationships betweenfamilies and occurrence of sex differences in FID are apparent. In 66% of 38species, no sex difference in FID was observed.[OEBPS_Images_image00923.jpeg]Figure 5.5In Platysaurus intermedius, approach distance (FID) is longer in males thanfemales.(Lailvaux et al. 2003 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.73])Distance fled did not differ between sexes in 21 species, and was longer inmales than females in one species (r = 0.29) plus one of three populations of asecond species (r = 0.42). In no case was DF longer for females than males. Theproportion of individuals that entered refuges did not differ between sexes infive species. Males were more likely than females to enter refuges in onespecies and one of three populations of another (r = 0.39 ± 0.04); in no caseswere females more likely to enter refuges.The sexes of most lizards do not differ substantially in FID, DF, or refugeentry, but when sex differences occur, males seem more likely than females to bethe warier sex, perhaps due to greater predation risk associated with somecombinations of bright coloration, territorial patrolling and defense, andcourtship behavior. However, social costs of fleeing may have countervailingeffects (section 5.2.2.2 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#C-sec-8]), suggesting thatgreater wariness by males than females may occur when males are more active andexposed, but not in contexts in which fleeing imposes social opportunity costs.Greater wariness by females could be related to body size differences andslowing due to gravidity or pregnancy (Shine 1980[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.98]; Cooper et al. 1990[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.52]; Olsson et al. 2000[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.87]). The effect of clutch or litter mass onescape behavior is less clear because gravid females may compensate by remainingcloser to refuge or may rely more on crypsis due to immobility to avoid beingdetected (Cooper et al. 1990 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.52]), which mayexplain the shorter FID of gravid than non-gravid Eulamprus tympanum(Schwartzkopf & Shine 1992 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.95]).Relationships between predator and prey sizes and predation risk are variable.As hatchlings grow, they may become too large to be prey of small predators. Insuch cases, hatchlings might be warier than larger, older individuals. Forlarger predators, lizards may become increasingly attractive prey as they growlarger. Furthermore, bright tail coloration in juveniles affects bothdetectability and escape ability (Cooper &Vitt 1985[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.48]). The balance of these opposing effectsmay determine the relationship between body size and wariness (Cooper 2011a[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.34]). Therefore information on such factorsis needed to predict the relationships between size/age and wariness.In studies with a limited range of lizard body size, neither FID (three species)nor DF (two species) was correlated with snout-vent length. However, prey sizeis important when a wider range of size is included. Larger lizards had longerFID for ten of eleven species belonging to five lizard families (r = 0.40 ±0.09). In one of these ten species, Amblyrhynchus cristatus, a second studyreported that FID is longer in juveniles than in either hatchlings or adults (r= 0.16), hinting that in this population, juveniles may remain attractive asprey to small predators and have become larger enough to be attractive to largerpredators. Given the preponderance of cases in which FID is longer in older,larger, lizards, assessed risk when approached by a large predator appears to begreater for larger lizards. In the sole remaining species, FID did not differamong age/size categories.For distance fled and refuge entry, age/size relationships to FID are variable.In three species no age/size differences were detected in DF. Of the two otherspecies tested, DF was longer in adults than juveniles in one (r = 0.56) andlonger in juveniles than adults in the other (r = 0.67). The proportion oflizards that entered refuge did not differ among age/size groups in one species;in two species it was greater for larger lizards (r = 0.49 ± 0.19) and in onespecies it was greater for hatchlings than adults (r = 0.10). The relationshipsof the escape variables DF and refuge entry with age and size may be affected byrelationships of age/size with conspicuousness, vulnerability, and distance torefuge, but these factors remain to be investigated.5.2.1.2.4 AUTOTOMY AND TAIL CONDITIONCaudal autotomy (voluntary severing of the tail) often permits lizards to escapewhen contacted by a predator (Congdon et al. 1974[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.14]; Cooper & Vitt 1985[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.48], 1991[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.49]). Depending on how much of the tail islost, the ability to use autotomy to escape in future encounters is diminishedor lost until the tail regenerates. Running speed decreases after autotomy inmost species (Bateman & Fleming 2009 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.1];Cooper et al. 2009a [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.57]). Recentlyautotomized lizards are at greater risk when approached, and are predicted toadjust their behavior to reduce risk. One way of doing so is to increase FID.Additional possibilities are staying closer to refuge and entering refuge.Effects of recent experimentally induced autotomy have been studied in the fieldin three species. In Cordylus melanotus autotomy did not affect FID or DF, butautotomy also did not affect running speed (McConnachie & Whiting 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.85]). In Holbrookia propinqua, FID was notaffected by autotomy, but autotomized lizards stayed closer to refuges (r =0.49) and males, but not females, fled shorter distances than intact lizards (r= 0.39; Cooper 2003 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.22]). In Sceloporusvirgatus autotomized individuals had longer FID (r = 0.58) and were more likelyto enter refuges (r = 0.45) than individuals having intact tails (Cooper 2007b[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.26]; Cooper & Wilson 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.51]).Effects of autotomy on escape behavior are expected to wane over time asregeneration proceeds, but may persist longer if lizards have adjusted escapestrategy to reduce the heightened risk. In observational studies some tailbreaks have occurred recently, but others may have occurred weeks or monthsbefore observations. In such studies of six species from four families, FID wasshorter in autotomized than intact lizards in four species (r = 0.40 ± 0.02),and in larger, but not smaller individuals in a fifth species (r = 0.68; Kelt etal. 2002 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.71]). In the remaining species,intact and autotomized lizards had similar FIDs. This suggests that thelong-term effect of autotomy on FID may be more consistent across taxa than theshort-term effect. The long-term effect may be a consequence of staying closerto refuge or increased reliance on immobility to avoid detection.Initial and prolonged effects of autotomy may differ. In Sceloporus virgatus FIDis longer in recently autotomized than intact lizards (Cooper 2007b[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.26]: Figure 5.6[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#FIGm-fig-29]), but shorter when observations are madeat longer intervals after autotomy. The initial effect may occur beforeadjustments in escape strategy occur.[OEBPS_Images_image00924.jpeg]Figure 5.6The FID in Sceloporus virgatus is longer after the tail is lost by autotomy thatin lizards having intact tails.(Cooper 2007b [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.26])5.2.1.2.5 FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE CONDITIONFemale lizards run slower when gravid or pregnant than at other times becausetheir mass is increased by eggs or due to changes in physiology while gravid(Shine 1980 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.98]; Cooper et al. 1990[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.52]; Olsson et al. 2000[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.87]). Because predation risk is greater forslower prey, gravid females are predicted to have longer FID unless they staycloser to refuge or rely more on crypsis conferred by immobility to avoid beingdetected. Flight inititation distance was shorter for gravid than non-gravidfemales in three species (r = 0.30 ± 0.06, range 0.18–0.36). In a fourth speciesFID did not differ between gravid and non-gravid females. Distance fled wasshorter for gravid than non-gravid females in one species (r = 0. 23); in twoother species gravidity did not affect DF. Two of the species for which neitherFID nor DF was related to gravidity are ecologically similar congeners thatusually remain near refuges (Smith 1996[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.103]; Cooper 2011a[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.34]). In one of those two species, theproportion of lizards that entered refuge also did not differ between gravid andnon-gravid females. That FID was shortened in gravid females in three speciesand DF in one species suggests that compensatory changes in behavior duringgravidity outweighed any increase in risk due to slower running speed. Where nosignificant differences were detected for FID or DF, gravid females may not havebeen greatly slowed or any increase in risk was balanced by changes in behaviorthat reduce risk.5.2.1.2.6 CONSPICUOUSNESSPrey that are camouflaged, employ special resemblance to objects, or use crypticpostures (Figure 5.7 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#FIGm-fig-30]) are predicted topermit closer approach than more conspicuous lizards. Because movement makesprey highly detectable, prey are predicted to have longer FID after recentlymoving than after prolonged immobility. Flight initiation distance was shorterwhere lizards matched backgrounds or objects (Figure 5.8[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#FIGm-fig-31]) in two species (r = 0.56 ± 0.00). Thehorned lizard Phrynosoma modestum had longer FID after recent movement thanafter prolonged immobility (r = 0.82; Cooper & Sherbrooke 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.43]) and when standing than when lying flaton the ground because the contours of the lizard blend into the substrate whenlying flat (r = 0.80; Cooper & Sherbrooke 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.44]). In Callisaurus draconoides FID and DFwere longer after recent movement than immobility (Cooper & Sherbrooke 2013a[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.45]). These are large effects that deservefurther investigation as potentially important cues for risk assessment.[OEBPS_Images_image00925.jpeg]Figure 5.7The round-tailed horned lizard, Phrynosoma modestum, adopts a posture that makesit resemble a small rock.(Cooper & Sherbrooke 2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.43])[OEBPS_Images_image00926.jpeg]Figure 5.8When among small rocks P. modestum permits closer approach before fleeing thanwhen resting on open sand.5.2.1.2.7 PURSUIT-DETERRENT SIGNALINGBecause a predator that has received pursuit-deterrent signals is less likely toattack (Holley 1993 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.67]; Ruxton et al. 2004[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.91]), predation risk is reduced. InCallisaurus draconoides, FID of lizards that have performed a tail-wavingdisplay is shorter than in those that have not (r = 0.57, Cooper 2011b[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.35]). This finding confirms the predictionthat signaling decreases assessed risk based on the assumption that signalingmust be somewhat effective to be maintained by natural selection.5.2.1.3 PREDATOR AND APPROACH FACTORS5.2.1.3.1 PREDATOR APPROACH SPEEDThe predator’s approach speed strongly affects FID. Flight initiation distancewas longer for faster than slower approach speed (Figure 5.9[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#FIGm-fig-32]) in all seventeen studies of thirteenspecies representing eight families (r = 0.72 ± 0.04, range 0.30–0.94). Thesefindings emphatically confirm the prediction of economic escape theory that FIDincreases as predation risk increases. When a predator approaches slowly,lizards allow closer approach because they have more time to reach a refuge thanif a predator approaches more rapidly. Even for prey that flee across ground anduse refuges infrequently, faster approach speed requires earlier fleeing toattain high escape speed before being overtaken.[OEBPS_Images_image00927.jpeg]Figure 5.9In Sceloporus jarrovii, FID is longer for direct approaches (0 m) at both slowand fast approach speeds than for indirect approaches that bypass the lizards by1 m.(Cooper & Avalos 2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.38])Distance fled in two studies was longer when approach was faster (r = 0.57 ±0.19). The proportion of lizards that entered refuge before ceasing to flee wasgreater for faster than slower approaches in two studies (r = 0.65 ± 0.02). Forboth DF and refuge entry, economic predictions are affected by the lizard’sdistance from refuge. For individuals that flee into refuge or stop by therefuge’s entry point, DF is greater for lizards that are farther from the refugeprior to fleeing. The strength of the relationship between distance to refugeand distance fled must increase as the proportion of individuals that enterrefuge increases.Lizards adjacent to refuges are likely to enter upon fleeing, but manyindividuals at longer distances from refuge flee towards them, but stop fleeingbefore entering it. This is a consequence of the method of approach used inlizard studies: the approaching researcher stops moving as soon as a lizardbegins to flee. After the predator stops, some prey stop before reaching refuge,thereby avoiding costs of refuge use. Lizards farther from refuge are morelikely to stop fleeing without entering than lizards closer to refuges,resulting in a decrease in proportion of individuals that enter refuge asinitial distance from refuge increases. Therefore the probability of enteringrefuge decreases as distance to refuge increases, whereas DF increases asdistance to refuge increases (section 5.2.1.1.1[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#aid-F8918]).Because FID and DF increase with distance to refuge, studies of effects ofapproach speed and other risk factors must avoid bias caused by differences indistance to refuge. In typical experimental studies, distance to refuge variesamong individual prey, but average distance to refuge is not expected to varyamong groups. The effect of variation in distance to refuge is to increase errorvariance, but not to bias results. This error variance can be reduced byrestricting observations to a limited range of distance to refuge. Another wayto detect an effect of approach speed is to statistically account for the effectof distance to refuge using multiple regression or by using distance to refugeas a covariate.5.2.1.3.2 DIRECTNESS OF APPROACHA predator approaching indirectly, i.e., along a path that will not contact theprey, poses less threat than a predator approach directly along a line thatintersects the prey’s position. An indirectly approaching predator is morelikely than one approaching directly to have not yet detected and to fail todetect the prey before the prey passes out of the predator’s visual field. Adirectly approaching predator that has detected the prey is more likely to beapproaching to attack, whereas an indirectly approaching predator is more likelyto be searching for prey or passing through the area for other reasons.The main variable used to indicate directness of approach is minimum bypassdistance, the predator–prey distance when the predator reaches the closest pointto the prey on its path. Minimum bypass distance is zero for direct approachesand is progressively longer as approach becomes less direct. For a fixed minimumbypass distance in such tangential approaches, the angle between the direct andindirect approach paths increases as starting distance decreases. It isimportant to use a fixed SD across trials unless the goal is to discern aneffect of the angle of approach from that of the minimum bypass distance. To myknowledge, no studies have been done to make this potentially importantdistinction. Several studies have employed the same SD for direct approaches andrelatively small minimum bypass distances. They have necessarily used longer SDsto permit longer minimum bypass distances. Reported effect of directness ofapproach may be a combination of effects of minimum bypass distance and approachangle.Because risk is predicted to increase as approach becomes more direct, FID isexpected to be longest for direct approach and to decrease when approach is lessdirect. This poses an experimental problem because when the minimum bypassdistance exceeds the FID observed for direct approach, lizards do not flee. Theminimum bypass distance for lizards that do not flee is therefore not useful asa maximum estimate of FID. For each species, pilot trials must be conducted todetermine FIDs for direct approaches and a shorter minimum bypass distance mustbe chosen for study. Bypass distances longer than the FID for direct approachmay be useful in studies of probability of fleeing, but are irrelevant for studyof the effect of directness of approach on FID. Due to the effect on assessedrisk, DF and probability of fleeing also are predicted to increase as directnessof approach increases.For all of eighteen species of lizards from nine families, FID was longer duringdirect than indirect approaches (Figure 5.9[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#FIGm-fig-32]) using short minimum bypass distances(1–3 m). The longer minimum bypass distances were used for larger or warierspecies. The effect size was r = 0.44 ± 0.06, range 0.16 – 0.93).The proportion of individuals that fled was greater for direct than indirectapproaches in all of ten species (r = 0.70 ± 0.04, range 0.19–0.74). Duringindirect approaches, most individuals that fled did so only when the predatorreached the minimum bypass distance (Cooper 1997b[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.16]). One interpretation is that fleeingfrequently occurs at the minimum bypass distance as the risk is greater at thatdistance than at any other distance. Between the starting point of approach andthe point of minimum bypass distance, risk increases should the predator changedirection and attack. Probability of fleeing should increase as the predatorapproaches the point closest to the predator. This presumably accounts for somevariance in FID and probability of fleeing. However, the high frequency offleeing only at the minimum bypass distance suggests another factor. Once thepredator passes the closest point to the prey, risk diminishes so that fleeingis not necessary. The prey passes out of a human investigator’s line of sight atthe minimum bypass distance. Therefore prey that flee at the minimum bypassdistance may have delayed escape while the predator was close and could attackupon observing the prey’s movements. Once the predator cannot see a prey, theprey can safely withdraw to a nearby refuge (Cooper 1997b[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.16]).Little is known about the effect of directness of approach on DF, but DF waslonger during direct than indirect approach in two studies. The effect size ofdirectness on DF (r = 0.35 ± 0.07, range 0.28–0.42) was only half as large atits effect on refuge entry. The smaller effect on DF may be a consequence ofproximity to refuge of numerous individuals in these studies.Flight initiation distance, distance fled, and proportion of individuals thatfled increase as the directness of approach increases, as predicted. Forapproaches with longer minimum bypass distances, probability of fleeingdecreases to zero as minimum bypass increases. For minimum bypass distancesgreater than or equal to that for which no lizards flee, FID and DF also equalzero.5.2.1.3.3 PREDATOR TURN DIRECTIONA predator that has stopped moving near a prey poses a threat that is reflectedin the effect of standing distance on latency to flee (Chapter 2[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#CN-bp-2]). If the predator’s body is orientedparallel to the prey’s body rather than facing it at a right angle, the predatormay turn toward or away from the prey. When the predator rapidly turns towardthe prey, assessed risk is expected to increase because the turn may indicatethat the predator has detected the prey and is attacking. When a predator turnsaway from the prey, assessed risk may decrease because the predator may bepaying attention to something else.Risk while the predator is immobile increases as predator–prey distancedecreases. When a predator begins to turn rapidly, the assessed risk is expectedto increase. At long predator–prey distances, assessed risk will be too low toelicit flight regardless of the direction turned by the predator. When thepredator is standing so close that risk is very high if it attacks, the prey mayflee regardless of turn direction because it must react immediately to themovement without taking time to ascertain the direction of turning to themovement if it is to escape. It flees even if the predator turns away. The mostinteresting case occurs at intermediate predator–prey distances that allow theprey enough time to recognize the turn direction. In this range of distances, itmay be predicted that the prey is more likely to flee when the predator turnstoward than away from it.These predictions have been verified consistently. At the shortest standingdistances virtually all lizards flee immediately regardless of turn direction;at very long standing distances almost no lizards flee regardless of turndirection. Here the results are reported only for intermediate distances whereturn direction affects probability of fleeing. For each species it is necessaryto conduct pilot tests to determine the appropriate range of distances.For each of ten lizard species from five families, the proportion of individualsthat fled at the intermediate standing distance was greater when the predatorturned toward than away from the prey (r = 0.64 ± 0.06, range 0.40–1.00; Figure5.10 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#FIGm-fig-33]). Clearly, lizards assess risk asbeing greater when a predator turns toward them than away. Two studies reportedthat the probability of fleeing, regardless of turn direction, increases asdistance between the prey and immobile predator decreases (r = 0.69 ± 0.22).These findings confirm the predictions that the proportion of individuals thatflee increases as the predator’s standing distance decreases and is greater whenthe predator turns toward the prey in an intermediate range of distances.[OEBPS_Images_image00928.jpeg]Figure 5.10When a predator standing nearby suddenly turns, the proportion of Holbrookiapropinqua that flee does not differ with turn direction for the shortest andlongest standing distances, but is higher when the predator turns toward thanaway from the prey at intermediate distances.(Cooper 1998c [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.19])5.2.1.3.4 APPROACH ELEVATION AND SIDEDNESSWhen prey are situated on slopes, predators may attack from above or below. Iflizards interpret attack from above by a researcher as an aerial attack, theymight assess risk as being greater due to the high expected speed of aerialpredators. They also might be more vulnerable when attacked from above becauselizards can escape by running up slopes where larger predators and investigatorsmay be slowed. In a skink and a lacertid, FID was greater for approaches fromabove than below (r = 0.35 ± 0.10, range 0.26–0.45). Distance fled was greaterfor approaches from above in the lacertid (r = 0.24), but did not differ in theskink. The proportion of lizards that entered refuge did not differ betweenapproached from above and below in the lacertid.Because many species have side preferences (lateralization) and associateddifferences in reaction time (Ward & Hopkins 1993[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.109]; Bisazza et al. 1998[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.3]), escape responses might differ whenlizards are approached from the left or right. However, in the sole study ofthis possibility, FID, DF, and refuge entry were unaffected by the side fromwhich a predator approached (Cooper & Pérez-Mellado 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.41]).5.2.1.3.5 REPEATED APPROACH AND PREVIOUS CAPTURESIf a predator approaches, the prey flees successfully, but the predatorapproaches again after a brief interval, the predator’s persistence indicatesthat it may pose an ongoing threat associated with greater risk of predationthan a predator that approaches once and then desists. Therefore economic escapetheory predicts that repeated approach should elicit longer FID; its extensionspredict that DF and probability of entering refuge are less for initial thansubsequent approaches.In twelve species from four families, FID was longer for the second of twoapproaches (Figure 5.11 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#FIGm-fig-34]). Thisdifference was significant in 11 of 12 species with substantial effect size (r =0.60 ± 0.04, range 0.00–0.84). Distance fled was greater in three species fromthree families (r = 0.55 ± 0.04, range 0.47–0.61). The proportion of individualsthat entered refuge in three species from two families was greater for secondthan first approaches (r = 0.55 ± 0.09, range 0.47–0.72). All three predictionshave been verified, demonstrating that prey update their assessment of predationrisk to account for ongoing aspects of predator behavior during encounters.[OEBPS_Images_image00929.jpeg]Figure 5.11In Sceloporus virgatus FID is longer for the second of two successive approachesat a fast, but not a slow, approach speed.(Based on data from Cooper 2009c [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.31])Lizards that have been captured previously by researchers are expected to assessapproach as riskier and to exhibit longer FID and DF. In three species FIDincreased as number of previous captures increased or was greater for previouslycaptured than naïve prey (r = 0.37 ± 0.02, range 0.34–0.40). Distance fled waslonger in one species for lizards that had been captured previously than had not(r = 0.34), but the proportion of individuals that entered refuge was notaffected by previous capture.5.2.1.3.6 STARTING DISTANCEBecause the distance and duration moved by a predator during its approach can bea cue to increasing risk and can affect the ability of prey to obtain benefitswhile monitoring the predator, FID is predicted to increase as SD increases(Chapter 2 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#CN-bp-2]; Cooper & Blumstein 2014[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.39]). In birds and mammals FID typicallyincreases as SD increases (Blumstein 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.5]; Stankowich & Coss 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.105]; Williams et al. 2014[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.113]) as predicted, but findings for lizardshave been mixed.The relationship between SD and FID have been studied in seven species from fivefamilies. Among these are five species of ambush foragers that have very lowrates of spontaneous movement and low cost of monitoring because feedingattempts are infrequent. When these lizards were approached at a slow walkingspeed, FID was not correlated with SD. When approached at a faster walkingspeed, FID increased as SD increased in one species (r = 0.50), but not another.The other two species are active foragers that have higher rates of spontaneousmovement and spend a longer proportion of the time moving (Cooper 2007c[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.27]). Of these, FID increased as SDincreased at a fast, but not a slow, approach speed in the lacertid Podarcislilfordi (Cooper et al. 2009b [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.58]; Figure5.12 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#FIGm-fig-35]); it increased as SD increased at aslow approach speed in the teiid Aspidoscelis exsanguis (r = 0.42; Cooper 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.28]). These limited data suggest that theFID–SD relationship is stronger when predation risk is higher (at fasterapproach speed). This is consistent with (1) a dynamic increase in assessed riskrelated to distance approached by the predator that only occurs at a rapidapproach speed in some species and (2) a stronger relationship exists betweenFID and SD in active foragers than ambush foragers. One reason for the lattereffect may be that it is more costly for active than ambush foragers to remainmotionless, which prevents active foraging, implying that the cost of monitoringmay be greater (Cooper & Blumstein 2014 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.39])for active foragers. Starting distance was unrelated to DF in two species and toprobability of entering refuge in one.[OEBPS_Images_image00930.jpeg]Figure 5.12At fast, but not slow, approach speed, FID by Podarcis lilfordi increases as SDof the predator’s approach increases.(Cooper et al. 2009b [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.58])5.2.1.3.7 SUDDEN SHADOWINGA shadow that suddenly passes overhead may be a strong cue to attack by apredator, especially an aerial or large predator. Immediate escape is predictedwhen a shadow rapidly covers a lizard, and the effect on escape frequency shouldbe greater when the shadow falls directly on a lizard than nearby, greater whenthe shadow’s speed is greater, and greater when a lizard is orientedhorizontally where it is more vulnerable to attack from above than when orientedvertically (Cooper 2009a [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.29]). When shadowswere cast by a human hand, the proportion of lizards that fled was greater whenthe shadow fell directly on lizards than nearby (Figure 5.13[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#FIGm-fig-36]) in three species (r = 0.76 ± 0.09,range 0.58–0.89). In single experiments the proportion of lizards that fled wasgreater when shadow speed was faster (r = 0.77) and when lizards werehorizontally rather than vertically oriented (r = 0.82). Rapid shadowing appearsto be a major cue to immediate threat of predation.[OEBPS_Images_image00931.jpeg]Figure 5.13The proportion of individuals that flee in Sceloporus virgatus is higher when ashadow suddenly passes over them than when it falls nearby.(Cooper 2009a [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.29])5.2.1.3.8 PREDATION PRESSUREPrey in populations exposed to higher predation pressure may become warierthrough experience and via natural selection. In studies of seven species inthree families, FID was longer for populations having higher predation pressurein six species. In the seventh species, FID was longer where predation pressurewas higher in a study limited to two populations of Podarcis lilfordi (Cooper etal. 2009c [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.59]), but was unrelated to FID ina study of seven populations (Cooper & Pérez-Mellado 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.42]). For the six species in which FIDincreased as predation pressure increased, the effect size of predation pressurewas large (r = 0.67 ± 0.08). Even with the species lacking an effect added, r =0.58 ± 0.12 (range 0.00–0.86).In four species, DF was longer where predation pressure was higher (r = 0.61 ±0.21; Figure 5.14 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#FIGm-fig-37]), but DF and predationpressure were unrelated in two species. Overall, the effect size wasintermediate (r = 0.41 ± 0.18, range 0.00–0.98). Very large effect sizes (r ≥0.96) occurred for two lacertid species in the Balearic Islands that typicallyescape without entering refuge in some populations. The proportion ofindividuals that entered refuges were higher where predation pressure wasgreater in all of three studies (r = 0.47 ± 0.21, range 0.13–0.84), with asingle large effect size in a species that relies heavily on refuges.[OEBPS_Images_image00932.jpeg]Figure 5.14In the marine iguana Amblyrhynchus cristatus, FID is longer where predationintensity is greater.(Berger et al. 2007 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.2])Collectively, the findings confirm the predictions of economic escape theorythat FID, DF, and refuge entry increase as risk represented by predationpressure increases. The findings for habituation and predation pressure togethersuggest that lizard populations adjust FID to frequency of past attacks.5.2.1.3.9 PREDATOR SIZE AND NUMBERPotential prey may be too little to be profitable for predators too large to beovercome (Owen-Smith & Mills 2008 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.88]).Predation risk increases as the prey’s size brings it into the range favored bythe predator. Within the preferred prey size range, the prey’s risk may increaseas the size of the predator relative to that of the prey increases. In twolizard species, the proportion of individuals that fled (r = 0.98 ± 0.08, range0.97–0.99) and FID increased as the size of small predator models increased(Cooper & Stankowich 2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.47]). Thesefindings match predictions based on increase in assessed risk with increase inpredator size.The number of predators approaching simultaneously might also affect FID if thetotal risk of being captured is greater when more predators approach. In testsat slow approach speed, neither FID nor DF differed for approaches by onepredator or two predators side by side; in the same species in using a fasterapproach speed, FID was longer for approaches by two than one predator, but DFwas not affected by number of predators (Cooper et al. 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.55]). The number of predators was importantonly at the higher risk level associated with faster approach, but moreinformation is needed on responses of additional prey species.5.2.1.3.10 PREDATOR FACIAL EXPOSURE, DIRECTION OF GAZE, AND EYE SIZEFacial exposure of the predator to the prey may indicate that the predator’sfield of view includes the prey, and eye contact indicated by directness of gazeis a cue that a predator may have detected the prey. Finally large eye size mayindicate high visual acuity and be associated with dangerous predators such asraptors. These factors are expected to increase assessed risk and lengthen FIDand DF.When the predator’s face was exposed to Ctenosaura similis, FID (r = 0.58) andDF (r = 0.52) were longer than when its face was hidden (Burger & Gochfeld 1993[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.10]). In the same species, FID was longerfor direct than averted gaze (r = 0.18), but DF did not differ between directand averted gaze (Burger et al. 1992 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.12]).In a different species the proportion of lizards that fled during indirectapproaches was much greater as soon as the predator reached a point where theprey passed out of its field of view than at any other point on its approachpath (r = 0.98; Cooper 1997b [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.16]). Whenescape occurred, the predator’s face was still visible to the prey, but the eyeswere not. During indirect approaches, the proportion of lizards that fled, FID,and DF did not differ when the predator looked directly at the lizard or gazeddirectly ahead along its path (Cooper 2011c[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.36]). Directness of gaze may be unimportantduring indirect approach that would not lead to contact with the prey. Finally,FID (r = 0.37) and DF (r = 0.18) were longer when eye size was artificiallyincreased (Burger et al. 1991 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.11]).Lizards use features of the predator’s face and eyes as indicators of the degreeof predation risk, but the effects of eye size and directness of gazed wererelatively small compared to facial exposure and visibility of eyes. Morestudies are needed to determine the importance of direct gaze as a predationrisk factor.5.2.2 COST OF FLEEING FACTORS THAT AFFECT FID, DF, AND RELATED VARIABLES5.2.2.1 FORAGINGPrey in the presence of food must give up a feeding opportunity to flee, whichis especially costly when opportunities are limited. Economic escape theorypredicts that lizards presented with insects or other food have shorter FID andDF, and that the shortening will be more pronounced as the amount of foodpresent increases. In four species representing four families, FID was shorterwhen food was present than absent (r = 0.73 ± 0.04, range 0.60–0.81; Figure 5.15[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#FIGm-fig-38]). As the number of food items presentedto Podarcis lilfordi increased, FID became progressively shorter in (r = 0.93)and DF decreased (r = 0.33; Cooper et al. 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.54]). Loss of feeding opportunities is amajor cost of fleeing. In addition to the above findings, FID and DF wereshorter above ground on inflorescences where Podarcis lilfordi licks nectar thanon the ground even though lizards above ground had farther to flee (r = 0.40each; Pérez-Cembranos et al. 2013 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.89]).[OEBPS_Images_image00933.jpeg]Figure 5.15Presence of food reduces FID at slow and fast predator approach speeds inCnemidophorus murinus.(Cooper et al. 2003 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.53])5.2.2.2 SOCIAL COSTS OF FLEEINGIf a prey may lose a social opportunity by fleeing, its fitness may be impactedthrough loss of fertilizations or other social benefits. Males have been thefocus of almost all studies of social cost of fleeing, but it may affect femalestoo. Male territory holders are predicted to have shorter FID and DF than othermales. In the presence of a female, a territorial male is also expected to beless likely than a non-territorial floater male to enter refuge. In species inwhich males guard females rather than territories, guarding males are predictedto have shorter FID and DF than non-guarding males. If conspecifics areexperimentally introduced, males are predicted to have shorter FID becauseunfamiliar females may be courted and possibly fertilized, whereas introducedmales may be rivals.Territorial males are less likely to enter refuge than are floater males (r =072; Stapley & Keogh 2004 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.106]). In anotherspecies males have shorter FID when on than off their territories (r = 0.56;Shallenberger 1970 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.97]). In a third species,Urosaurus ornatus, males having orange-blue throat coloration are territorial,whereas those having the orange throat color morph are non-territorial (Thakeret al. 2009 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.108]). For this species, FID isshorter for the territorial orange-blue than orange males (r = 0.52; Figure 5.16[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#FIGm-fig-39]).[OEBPS_Images_image00934.jpeg]Figure 5.16In Urosaurus ornatus FID is shorter in territorial males with orange-blue thannon-territorial males having orange throat coloration.(Thaker et al. 2009 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.108])In two species, guarding males had shorter FID than non-guarding males (r = 0.38± 0.14, range 0.24–0.52; Figure 5.17 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#FIGm-fig-40]),the effect size being larger for a skink than a lacertid. Mate guarding did notaffect DF in the sole species studied. In the skink, guarding males had shorterFID than guarded females (r = 0.54; Cooper 1999b[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.21]), consistent with the greater cost offleeing for guarding males. In the lacertid being guarded did not affect FID byfemales (Martín & López 1999 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.81]).[OEBPS_Images_image00935.jpeg]Figure 5.17Approach distance (FID) in Plestiodon laticeps when a female is introduced isshorter for males guarding females than for solitary males; it is also shorterin solitary males when a female rather than a control stimulus is introduced.(Cooper 1999b [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.21])When conspecifics are experimentally introduced, FID is consistently affected,but the direction of the effect depends on the sex and circumstances of thefocal and introduced lizards. In three species from three families, FID of maleswas shorter when males rather than control stimuli were introduced (r = 0.57 ±0.15, range 0.40–0.88). In one of these, the effect of female presence overrodethat of approach speed (r = 0.79). Male FID in two species was shorter whenfemales rather than control stimuli were introduced (r = 0.73 ± 0.14, range =0.60–0.88). In one species, FID of guarding males was longer than that ofisolated males when a female was introduced (r = 0.30), which was interpreted asindicating greater potential gain for the isolated male because guarders wouldhave to relax guarding to court an introduced female.The FID of females in a territorial phrynosomatid species, Sceloporus virgatus,is shorter when a conspecific female rather than a control is introduced (r =0.72, Cooper 2009b [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.30]). Such femalesaggressively reject courtship by males. Failure to do so may be costly,resulting in shorter FID. In a study that did not identify sexes of Phrynosomamodestum, FID was shorter in the presence of a conspecific than when the focallizard was alone (r = 0.62; Cooper & Sherbrooke 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.43]).Collectively, the findings for social costs show that presence of conspecificmales or females may impose large costs of fleeing on territorial andmate-guarding males. These costs are reflected in shortened FID as predicted.5.2.3 IMPORTANCE OF COSTS OF NOT FLEEING AND COSTS OF FLEEING: RELATIVE EFFECTSIZESFrom the foregoing, it is apparent that FID by lizards is affected by manyfactors that influence the cost of not fleeing and the cost of fleeing. Effectsizes are highly variable within and between factors. Within a single factor,variation may occur due to interspecific differences or differences inexperimental procedures that affect assessed risk and cost of fleeing.Between-factor variation in effect size may indicate which factors are moreimportant, but caution is needed in such interpretations because effects of allbut one or two factors are typically held constant in experiments and factorsmay interact.With these provisos in mind, some factors clearly have large effects on FID.Here I mention these factors that have been found to have consistent effects inat least four studies. Among predation risk factors, predator traits appear tohave the strongest effects, especially approach speed and repeated approach.Habitat factors and prey traits also have fairly strong effects on FID,especially partial concealment of the prey. Distance from refuge, perch height,body temperature, habituation, the prey’s body size, tail loss, conspicuousness,and directness of approach all have substantial effect sizes of 0.40 to 0.56.Foraging and social costs of fleeing also have large effect sizes. Thesefindings indicate that many factors affect escape decisions by lizards. Becauseeffect sizes are affected by levels of other cost of not fleeing and cost offleeing factors, the effect sizes given cannot be used to rank the importance ofthe factors. Many factors appear to strongly affect FID, but their relativeimportance may vary with other risk and cost-of-fleeing factors, as well as withthe prey’s fitness when the encounter begins.5.2.4 ESCAPE STRATEGYBrief allusions to changes in escape strategy have been made while interpretingeffects of predation risk factors. A substantial literature documentsdifferences in escape strategy, but this material is too extensive to be coveredhere. Selected topics are presented (see Chapter 8[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#CN-bp-8]).One way prey can decrease the likelihood of being captured is to decrease thepredictability of their escape behavior. Five species of Aspidoscelis fled todiverse microhabitats, exhibited differences in length and linearity of escaperuns, and varied in refuge use (Schall & Pianka 1980[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.92]). The authors argued that escapediversity should increase among conspecific populations as predation pressureincreases and should diverge among similar sympatric species having the samepredators, but these ideas remain untested.Locomotor capacities of lizards are related to habitat and escape strategies.Lacertid species occupying more open habitats are faster sprinters having lowerendurance and shorter FID than species occupying more vegetated sites; speciesthat use vertical structures tend to be faster climbers (Schulte et al. 2004[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.94]). Eight scincid species differed indiversity of escape behavior, which was related to differences in microhabitatsand locomotor specializations (Melville & Swain 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.86]). Four species had specialized locomotorabilities and escape behaviors; two species that use a range of microhabitatsused more diverse escape behaviors requiring different locomotor skills such assprinting, jumping, and climbing (Melville & Swain 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.86]).Anolis lizards often escape by running along branches or trunks. As branchdiameter decreases, running speed decreases and lizards may switch from runningto jumping (Losos & Irschick 1996 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.78]).Because running speed decreases as the angle at branch points increases, anolesprefer escape paths with small angles at branch points (Mattingly & Jayne 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.84]).Destinations and types of escape behavior often vary with circumstances. In Utastansburiana individuals near a cliff fled to it and escaped downward; thoselocated more than 15 m from the cliff fled in circles or non-directionally,perhaps to avoid leaving familiar ground or intruding on territories ofconspecifics (Zani et al. 2009 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.114]).Liolaemus multimaculatus escape by fleeing into patches of grass or buryingthemselves rapidly in sand. Burying frequency increased as distance to a patchof grass increased (Kacoliris et al. 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.70]). Differences in escape behavior relatedto location, habitat structure, and environmental conditions are presumablywidespread.Some lizards undergo ontogenetic color changes and associated changes in escapebehavior. Many lizards have brightly colored tails as juveniles that deflectattacks of predators away from the body, permitting escape by caudal autotomy(Cooper & Vitt 1985 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.48], 1991[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.49]). Bright tail coloration increasesdetectability, but increases escape ability. As lizards grow, they may be lesssubject to attack by small predators, but more subject to attack by larger, moreefficient predators, accounting for ontogenetic loss of bright tail coloration.Another hypothesis, not mutually exclusive, is that hatchlings with brightlycolored tails are more active and occupy sites more exposed to predation thanadults (Hawlena et al. 2006 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.64]). InAcanthodactylus beershebensis hatchlings with bright tails were more active inmore open locations than older lizards lacking bright tail coloration; theyperformed deflective tail displays not used by older lizards (Hawlena et al.2006 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.64]). Deflective tail displays are muchmore frequent in juvenile skinks, Plestiodon laticeps, having blue tails than inadults having tan tails (Cooper 1998b [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.18]).5.2.5 LATENCY TO FLEEWhen a predator is immobile near a prey that is immobile and aware of thepredator, latency to flee is predicted to decrease as cost of not fleeingincreases and latency to move is predicted to decrease as opportunity cost ofremaining immobile increases (Cooper et al. 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.60]; Chapter 2[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#CN-bp-2]). These predictions have been uniformlyverified in three studies. Latency to flee was shorter for high risk representedby prior chasing of the prey than for low risk in which the predator had notpreviously approached (r = 0.50). Latency to flee is shorter when the predator’sapproach speed before stopping is faster (r = 0.70 ± 0.04, n = 3); when thepredator approaches less directly (r = 0.64 ± 0.03, n = 3); and for the secondof two successive approaches (r = 0.50 ± 0.02, n = 2); when the predatormaintains eye contact with the prey rather averts its gaze by 30° (r = 0.35, n =1); and when the predator stands closer to the prey (r = 0.72 ± 0.06, n = 6;Martín et al. 2009 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.83]; Cooper et al. 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.60]; Cooper & Sherbrooke 2013b[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.46]; Figure 5.18[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#FIGm-fig-41]). Latency to move is shorter when foodis present than absent (r =0.74 ± 0.12, n = 2) and for males in the presencethan absence of females (r = 0.87, n = 1) (Cooper & Sherbrooke 2013b[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.46]).[OEBPS_Images_image00936.jpeg]Figure 5.18Latency to flee in Podarcis lilfordi increases as standing distance increases.(Cooper et al. 2012 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.60])5.3 SNAKES5.3.1 FID, DISTANCE FLED, AND PROBABILITY OF FLEEINGMuch less is known about escape decisions by snakes than other lizards. Manysnakes permit close approach without moving, relying on crypsis to avoid beingdetected and/or on envenomation as a defense. Decisions about FID and relatedvariables have been studied for few species (Table 5.1[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#aid-F89S7]). All but one of these are natricinecolubrids, which often occur at high density. For the material below, see Table5.1 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#aid-F89S7] for citations.Table 5.1 Factors affecting costs of not fleeing (risk) and of fleeing influenceescape decisions by snakes.Family/speciesRisk or costFactorMetricEffectSourceColubridaeNerodiasipedonriskwater temperatureFIDno effect1Nerodia sipedonriskperch heightFID↑ asPH ↓1Nerodia sipedonriskstarting distanceFID↑ as SD ↑2Nerodia sipedonrisksexFIDF> M2Nerodia sipedonrisk?ageFIDno effect2Nerodia sipedonrisk?air temperatureFIDnoeffect2Nerodia sipedonriskperch heightFIDno effect2Regina septemvittatariskbodytemperatureFID↑ as BT ↑3Regina septemvittatarisk?sexFIDno effect3Reginaseptemvittatarisk?body lengthFIDno effect3Thamnophis sirtalisrisk (cost?)den vsdispersingFIDdispersing > den4TropidonophismairiiriskpregnancyFID↑5Tropidonophis mairiicostmale breeding stateFIDNR ↑R5Tropidonophis mairiirisk?ageFIDno effect5Tropidonophis mairiirisk?sexFIDnoeffect5Tropidonophis mairiirisk?body lengthFIDno effect5Tropidonophismairiirisk?seasonFIDno effect5Tropidonophis mairiirisk?air temperatureFIDnoeffect5Tropidonophis mairiirisk?previous captureFIDno effect5Tropidonophismairiirisk?relative humidityFIDno effect5Tropidonophis mairiirisk?moonlightFIDnoeffect5ElapidaePseudonaja textilisrisk?approach speedFIDno effect6Pseudonajatextilisrisksnake motionFIDmoving > still6Pseudonaja textilisriskadult vs.juvenilePFJ > A6Pseudonaja textilisrisk?sexPFno effect6Pseudonajatextilisrisk?wind speedFIDno effect6Pseudonaja textilisriskcoverFIDsparse >dense6Pseudonaja textilisriskcoverPFsparse > dense6Pseudonaja textilisrisktimeof dayPF1001–1800 h > other6?: tested, but not shown to have an effect; A: adult; BT: body temperature; F:female; FID: flight initiation distance; J: juvenile; NR: non-reproductive; PF:probability of fleeing = proportion of individuals that fled; M: male; PH: perchheight; R: reproductive; SD: starting distance.1: Weatherhead & Robertson 1992 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.110]; 2:Cooper et al. 2008 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.56]; 3: Layne & Ford 1984[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.74]; 4: Shine et al. 2003a[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.100]; 5: Brown & Shine 2004[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.8]; 6: Whitaker & Shine: 1999[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.111].Few predation risk factors are known to influence escape decisions by snakes(Table 5.1 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#aid-F89S7]). As starting distanceincreased, FID increased. The likelihood of fleeing was greater for snakes insparser than denser cover, and was longer for moving than immobile snakes (Table5.1 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#aid-F89S7]), consistent with predictions ofescape theory. Some risk factors have variable effects on FID. No effect wasobserved for air or water temperature, but FID increased as body temperatureincreased in Regina septemvitta. Because body temperature affects locomotorcapacity, it is more closely related to escape than air or substratetemperature. In one study of Nerodia sipedon, FID decreased as perch heightincreased, as in lizards, but in another study PH of basking individuals did notaffect FID. Differences in distance from shore and availability of refuges mightexplain differences in the effect of PH.Sex differences in FID and probability of fleeing were observed in one of fourspecies. Female N. sipedon had longer FID than males, perhaps due to differencesin body size or pregnancy. Age and body length did not affect FID in threenatricines, but probability of fleeing was greater in juvenile than adultPseudonaja textilis, which often defend themselves aggressively. One reason forlack of effect of age in natricines may be that hatchlings and juveniles wereabsent or scarce in the samples.Several differences in escape between snakes and lizards are known. A findingunique to snakes is that FID is longer for Thamnophis sirtalis while dispersingfrom hibernacula than at the dens despite similar body size and temperature(Shine et al. 2003a [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.100]). Several factorsmight contribute to this result. While dispersing snakes are more likely to bemoving and alone. Any risk dilution provided by conspecifics at denselypopulated dens is lost during dispersal. Because reproduction occurs at dens,snakes there may exhibit shorter FID due to greater cost of fleeing.Being gravid or pregnant increases body mass and reduces locomotor speed ofsquamate reptiles (Shine 1980 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.98]; Cooper etal. 1990 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.52]). Lizards exhibit shorter FIDwhen gravid because gravid females may change their escape strategies, relyingmore or crypsis to avoid being detected or staying closer to refuges (section5.2.1.5). In the natricine T. mairii, FID is longer in pregnant thannon-pregnant females, matching the prediction of escape theory for prey that areslowed, but do not alter escape strategy, when pregnant.That male T. mairii have shorter FID when in reproductive condition than not(Brown & Shine 2004 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.8]) is also unique amongsquamates. In lizards, breeding males in the presence of unfamiliar females orguarding mates have shorter FID because fleeing may cost them fertilizations.Although male T. mairii were not guarding mates, fleeing might have reduced theprobability of mating with undetected females nearby. However, it is not certainthat the effect of reproductive condition is mediated by mating opportunity.Other possible differences in the ecology of breeding and non-breeding males,such as frequency of feeding and associated cost of fleeing or differences inmovement or microhabitat use that might affect predation risk, might account forthe observed difference.In the elapid Pseudonaja textilis, approach speed did not affect FID. This lackof relationship does not contradict the prediction of escape theory because P.textilis is a dangerously venomous species that defends itself aggressively whenit is likely to be overtaken.Another way in which escape decisions by snakes may differ from those typicalfor lizards is that previous capture did not affect FID in Tropidonophis mairii.However, this difference may be a consequence of differences in methods ofstudy. In studies of lizards, initial and subsequent captures occurred within afew days, but T. mairii were collected in a mark–recapture study and the meanintercapture interval was 229 days, obscuring any effect of being capturedrecently.Possible effects of several environmental factors that have no readilypredictable effect on escape by snakes have been investigated. No effects wereshown for time of day, season, relative humidity, moonlight, or wind speed inone species each (see table in the electronic supplementary material). However,season and time of day might have effects mediated by temperature, vegetativecover, and reproductive condition.Intraspecific variation in FID was pronounced among populations of T. sirtalisfrom four dens located within 20 m of each other. It is unclear whether thedifferences reflect genetic variation, differences in exposure to predation, orother factors. In the only comparative study of snakes, FID was longer in N.sipedon than in Thamnopis sauritus; it was intermediate in T. sirtalis, but didnot differ in the other two species (Scribner & Weatherhead 1995[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.96]). Distance fled was longer in N. sipedonthan in the other two species (Scribner & Weatherhead 1995[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.96]).5.3.2 REFUGE SELECTION AND ENTRYMany species of snakes flee to refuges. They may hide in holes, crevices, orunder objects, flee into and dive under water, or climb steep slope or plants,or jump from high in trees or on cliffs to prevent predators from pursuing them.However, refuge selection when pursued has received much more anecdotalattention than systematic study. Interspecific differences occur even amongclosely related species. In the comparative study of natricine snakes (Scribner& Weatherhead 1995 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.96]), T. sirtalis and T.sauritus often fled into dense vegetation, whereas N. sipedon often dived andswam underwater. These differences in refuge selection reflect differences inhabitats because N. sipedon occurred almost exclusively in aquatic habitats,often offshore, whereas the two species of Thamnophis occurred along the shoreor inland.5.3.3 ESCAPE STRATEGYMany venomous snakes do not flee while being approached, relying instead ondeterrence by or use of their chemical defenses. For example, the viper Gloydiusshedaoensis, the elapid Psuedonaja textilis, and the laticaudine seasnake(Laticauda colubrina) often do not flee even when harassed (Shine et al. 2002[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.99], 2003c[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.102]). Similarly, North American crotalinevipers often do not flee when approached (my personal observations for severalspecies of Crotalus, Agkistrodon piscivorus, and A. contortrix). With theexception of very large constrictors and cryptically colored species, othersnakes lacking such defenses are more likely to flee from predators (Fitch 1963[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.62], 1965[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.63]), especially species capable of veryrapid crawling, such as whipsnakes (Masticophis) and racers (Coluber; Fitch 1965[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.63]).Color patterns of snakes vary greatly and are related to types of defenses,which were divided into tendency to escape versus defenses other than fleeing(Jackson et al. 1976 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.69]). In a survey ofNorth American snakes north of Mexico, species having longitudinal striped colorpatterns and uniform or speckled patterns had higher escape speed and areexposed to visual predators longer each day than snakes having regularcross-banded patterns (perpendicular to the longitudinal axis), irregularbanding patterns (varying in shape along the length of the body and not alwaysperpendicular to the longitudinal axis), or blotched-spotted patterns (Jacksonet al. 1976 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.69]).Snakes having irregular banding and blotched-spotted color patterns tend to haveeffective defenses other than fleeing, such as envenomation, feigning death, andbluffing. Snakes that are unicolored or unicolored with speckles have a greatertendency to flee and greater flight capability than snakes having irregularbanding or blotched-spotted patterns (Jackson et al. 1976[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.69]). Snakes having striped body patternsexhibit similar traits to those of unicolored or unicolored-speckled snakes, butstriped snakes rely to an even greater extent on escape rather than alternativedefenses (Jackson et al. 1976 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.69]). In thenorthern garter snake, Thamnophis ordinoides, some snakes are striped and othersin the same population are not. When neonates were pursued, color morphs withless striping more frequently performed reversals – evasive maneuvers in whichthe snake suddenly reverses its direction and becomes immobile (Brodie 1989[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.6], 1992[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.7]). Reversal is believed to provide snakesa chance to re-establish crypsis, but striped snakes that employ reversals losethe advantage of difficulty for predators in following movement conferred bystriping (Brodie 1989 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.6], 1992[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.7]).Regularly banded snakes are intermediate in reliance on escape and escape speedto those having the other color patterns; they tend to escape by submerging andto be active in low illumination (Jackson et al. 1976[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.69]). Jackson et al. (1976[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.69]) discussed hypotheses suggesting thatuniform, striped, and regularly banded patterns mislead visually orientedpredators about immobility versus movement and speed, and presentedcircumstantial evidence that regularly banded patterns may appear to be uniformat speeds above the flicker fusion frequency of a predator (Pough 1976[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.90]). Regularly banded snakes moving fastenough to surpass the critical flicker fusion frequency would gain an advantageof uniform body coloration, making it difficult for a predator to judge itsspeed.Because the Jackson et al. (1976 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.69]) studywas conducted before currently used statistical methods were developed that takephylogenetic relationships into account, it is possible that correlations oftraits within genera and families might have produced inflated estimates ofsignificance. The hypothesized mechanisms by which the color patterns createillusions about a fleeing snake’s motion and speed deserve experimental testing.Snakes that flee in some circumstances may rely on alternate defenses in others.The strategy used varies with temperature, degree of cover, and is likely tovary with other factors that affect escape ability and detectability.Temperature affects probability of fleeing via its effect on locomotor capacity,and other variables. The shorter FID at lower body temperatures in R.septemvittata hints that snakes may switch from escape to other defenses whenbody temperature falls too low for rapid crawling. In the natricine Thamnopissirtalis (Shine et al. 2003b [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.101]) and theAfrican viper Bitis schneideri (Maritz 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.80]), the probability of fleeing is reducedat lower temperatures. Because the data for B. schneideri were combined,approach and a 30-s interval during which the snakes’ heads were touched fivetimes, it is uncertain whether FID or probability of fleeing were affected byapproach alone. The probability of fleeing by P. textilis is lower in sparserthan denser cover (Whittaker and Shine, 1999[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.111]). It may be predicted that probabilityof fleeing is reduced at low levels of illumination.Ecological differences between species may account for differences in escapebehavior in two elapids. Cryptophis nigrescens hunts actively in open areas atnight, whereas Hoplocephalus bungaroides ambush their prey in retreat sites insun-warmed rocks (Llewelyn et al. 2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.76]).Both species relied primarily on fleeing to escape, but the antipredatorybehavior of C. nigrescens, which is exposed to cool temperatures while foragingin the open, was less sensitive to thermal variation and its use of retaliatorydefense was less frequent than that of H. bungaroiedes (Llewelyn et al. 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.76]).5.4 CROCODILIANS, SPHENODONTIDANS, AND TURTLESLiterature searches did not reveal any papers about FID (or its synonyms) forcrocodilians, tuataras, or turtles. Alligators and other crocodilians oftenescape when approached by diving beneath the water surface. Tuataras escape intoburrows. Aquatic and semi-aquatic turtles typically escape by diving; suchturtles often flee to water if encountered near shore or drop off logs or bushesinto water when approached. Many turtles use their shells as refuges whenovertaken on land or captured in water. Terrestrial turtles and somesemi-aquatic species have shells that permit complete or nearly completewithdrawal of vulnerable body parts and, in some the shells close, effectivelyblocking access by predators to soft body parts.As discussed in Chapter 9 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#CN-bp-9], when the turtleMauremys leprosa is approached while on land, it attempts to flee to water, butif overtaken withdraws into its shell (Martín et al. 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#REFe-r-5.82]). In terrestrial turtles, running speedis too slow for escape from typical predators. When a predator draws near, theseturtles escape not by fleeing, but by withdrawing their hands and necks, legs,and often tails inside their shells. Aquatic turtles and semi-aquatic turtles inwater are more likely than terrestrial turtles to flee.5.5 FUTURE DIRECTIONSIt is apparent from the foregoing that research on snakes, turtles, tuataras,and crocodilians is needed. Incorporating effects of aspects of reptiliancognition, such as learning local escape routes and refuge sites, in escapestudies would also be valuable. Studies of escape by reptiles have focused oneffects of costs of not fleeing and costs of fleeing in single species. Onlyrecently have studies been published using the comparative method. As data formore species accumulate, comparative studies should make substantialcontributions to our knowledge of topics such as relationships of escapedecisions to locomotor capacity, sensory ability, morphological traits, ecology,and phylogeny.REFERENCESBateman, P.

Fleming and Philip W. Bateman6.1 INTRODUCTIONAlthough at first glance there seem to be significant differences between fishand amphibians in their habitat and therefore predation risk, they share manysimilar biological features (particularly fish and larval amphibians, i.e.,tadpoles) that govern their escape responses. Although anuran tadpoles fill asimilar niche to fish, they have a different body form, with a globose body andcompressed, tapered tail (Wassersug 1989[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.106]). In terms of awareness of theirenvironment, escape locomotion, and modifications of escape behavior, fish andamphibians share responses to the risk of potential predation (Wassersug 1989[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.106]).Teleost fish species make up about half of all vertebrate taxa (Volff 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.98]). This diversity of species means thatthere is a huge range in traits such as body size, color, presence of bodyarmor, and swimming speed. There are also diverse lifestyles, from pelagic,schooling fish through to solitary benthic species. In addition to theirbiological differences, fish can also experience a range of environmentalconditions (e.g., water turbidity, temperature, dissolved oxygen) that can makeit more or less physically or physiologically difficult to detect an approachingthreat or escape. All these factors can influence the ability of fish to escapedetection and predation (Domenici 2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.32]),and therefore influence their reliance on crypsis vs. swimming.Perhaps stimulated by this marked diversity among fishes, many predictions ofthe economic escape model (EEM) have been tested in fish. Fish have also beentested under a wide range of conditions, reflecting their diversity of habitatsand body forms.Amphibians are considerably less diverse than fish in terms of species. However,their dramatic change in lifestyle between tadpoles and adults takes them, inmost cases, from a three-dimensional water environment similar to thatexperienced by fish, to a relatively two-dimensional habitat with substantialgravitational effects, at least for some of the time. Visual acuity, visualrange, auditory inputs, and the physical limitations of locomotion thereforechange during the ontogeny of amphibians. Furthermore, this change can beaccompanied by a change in predation risks. On land, adult amphibians arepotential prey of many predators that they did not face as tadpoles. Crypticcoloration, immobility, and crouching serve as primary defenses by helpingprevent detection, but active escape behavior is often needed, particularly inspecies without toxic skin secretions. There is a relative dearth of escapeliterature for amphibians, and what there is, is dominated by frogs. In thefollowing chapter [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#CN-bp-7], we attempt to synthesizethe escape behavior of both fish and, primarily, larval amphibians in the lightof the predictions of the EEM (Ydenberg & Dill 1986[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.111]).6.2 THE METHODOLOGICAL CHALLENGES OF WORKING WITH FISH AND AMPHIBIANS6.2.1 HOW FISH AND AMPHIBIANS PERCEIVE THE WORLDAir and water have very different physical properties, and therefore one of themost significant differences between fish and adult amphibians is the medium inwhich they live. Light levels are attenuated rapidly in water, and therefore theeffects of turbidity and depth have a marked effect on visual perception forthese animals (see section 6.3.3.1 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#C-sec-13]). Visualcues trigger escape in response to looming and movement (e.g., Dill 1974a[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.29]; Paglianti & Domenici 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.79]; Hettyey et al. 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.50]). Auditory cues are important for fish(reviewed by Popper & Fay 1993 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.82]) andadult frogs (Cooper 2011 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.22] and referencestherein) and potentially for tadpoles (Hettyey et al. 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.50]). Olfactory cues (predator scents orcues of predated conspecifics) also modulate escape responses in fish (reviewedby Ferrari et al. 2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.40]) and amphibians(Petranka et al. 1987 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.80]; Semlitsch & Reyer1992 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.92]; Stauffer & Semlitsch 1993[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.93]; Maag et al. 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.69]). Chemicals released from the skin inresponse to being attacked apparently act to alert conspecifics of imminentdanger; adding the minced-up skins of conspecifics therefore alerts fish andamphibians to potential danger and increases their responses to predatory cues.Some fish (e.g., cartilaginous fishes) are sensitive to electrical stimuli.Because some of these senses exceed our own, and fish and amphibians have senseswe lack, these signals often can be overlooked when studying the escaperesponses of fish and amphibians. We should, therefore, be aware of our inherentbias toward visual or auditory cues.6.2.2 NEURAL CONTROL OF ESCAPE BEHAVIORBecause each encounter with a predator is potentially lethal, there is strongselection on efficient and effective escape mechanisms. Fish and amphibians makeinteresting subjects for investigation, since their escape behavior has arguablybeen stripped back to the most basic responses. Fish and amphibians have some ofthe simplest vertebrate brains (they have no neocortex); despite this, there isevidence that fish can modify their escape behaviors based on learning andexperience (Brown & Laland 2003 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.17]; Kelley& Magurran 2003 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.57]).Immediate escape responses, e.g., the fast burst escape swimming of teleosts andthe escape leap in frogs, have strong selection acting upon them, andconsequently have become hard-wired as short reflex response neuronal loops infish and amphibians that generate optimal behavioral responses; these initialreflexes are involuntary and nearly instantaneous “stereotypic” movements inresponse to stimulus (Eaton et al. 2001 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.37])(Box 6.1 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#BOXm-box-1]). Further aspects of escape(e.g., the distance moved and speed and trajectory of escape) are modified bythe environmental context or predator type and approach (reviewed for fish byDomenici 2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.32]), and thereforevariability in these responses can be dynamically modified as predicted by theEEM (Ydenberg & Dill 1986 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.111]; Walker etal. 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.100]; Domenici 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.32]; Marras et al. 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.71]; Chapter 8[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#CN-bp-8]).Box 6.1 “I’m getting out of here!” Short-burst escape responses in fish andamphibiansBoth fish and amphibians show dramatic initial escape responses to threateningstimuli, the kinematics, performance, and physiology of which have been wellstudied (Domenici & Blake 1997 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.34]; Eaton etal. 2001 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.37]; Wakeling 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.99]; Walker et al. 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.100]; Domenici 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.32]). These brainstem escape networks can bestimulated by sensory input from sound, mechanical vibration, electrical field,or visual cues (Eaton et al. 2001 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.37]).The Mauthner cells are a single pair of giant, bilateral neurons (one for eachhalf of the body) present in the hindbrains of fish and amphibians that mediatea very fast initial escape reflex, as well as participating in a largerparallel, brainstem escape network (Eaton et al. 2001[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.37]). They have been described as “commandneurons” (Eaton et al. 2001 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.37]) which areenvisioned as a type of neural decision-making cell that could trigger acomplete behavioral act with little or no need for additional input from thecommand neuron.In fish, the most extreme response to a threatening stimulus is the “fast start”escape response (Figure 6.1 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#FIGm-fig-42]), which is ashort burst (less than ~1 s) of high-energy swimming associated with a shortlatency and high acceleration and speed (Domenici & Blake 1997[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.34]; Turesson et al. 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.96]). Two main types of fast-starts arerecognized, C-starts and S-starts in which the fish is bent into a “C” or “S”shape at the end of the first contraction of the lateral musculature. TheC-starts are generally associated with escape responses away from the threat,while the S-starts with prey capture where the fish moves toward prey.[OEBPS_Images_image00937.jpeg]Figure 6.1Illustration of the fast-start escape response in fish.(Modified from Eaton et al. 2001 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.37])Amphibians have a similarly fast escape response system. Tadpoles have aC-start, combined with an extremely flexible tail allowing rapid turning withlittle or no displacement of their center of mass (Wassersug 1989[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.106]). In adult frogs, hard-wiredstereotyped movement patterns are evident as an explosive long leap (Ingle &Hoff 1990 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.52]) or diving response (Korn &Faber 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.59]). In an analogous situationas observed between C-start and S-start responses in fish, frogs also haveseparate post-tectal pathways stimulated for turning toward prey and turningaway from threat (King & Comer 1996 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.58]),and both short-term and long-term memories influence jump direction (Ingle &Hoff, 1990 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.52]). These separate neuralcontrol mechanisms may account for why a number of studies reveal independentregulation between predation avoidance and effective foraging (e.g., Horat &Semlitsch 1994 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.51]).6.2.3 LOGISTICAL ISSUESOne of the major difficulties in comparing these studies is that vastlydifferent stimuli have been used to test the escape responses of different taxa(Figure 6.2 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#FIGm-fig-43]). Most studies of small fishand tadpoles have been carried out in small tanks under captive conditions.Larger fish species have principally been examined in the field, e.g., testedfor responses to approaching models of predators, humans (i.e., swimmers orwading), or responses to being passed over by a boat. Frog responses have allbeen tested in response to human approach on foot in the wild.[OEBPS_Images_image00938.jpeg]Figure 6.2A wide range of stimuli have been used to initiate escape responses in fish andamphibians (frogs and tadpoles). The most common method for use in captivestudies has been presenting prey with predator models; this has the advantageover real predators of being able to control the speed and type of approach.Under natural conditions, most studies have explored how fish and frogs respondto an approaching person, either swimming, wading or walking toward them.While it is intuitive to human observers how many vertebrates react toapproaching predators or disturbance (e.g., “alert” behavior, cessation ofprevious behavior, gaze direction, alarm calling), this is less clear for fishand amphibians. It is not obvious when these animals are “alert” to thepredator’s presence, which means that we need to be very cautious ininterpreting “monitoring” or “alert distance” in these animals.There are also problems with measuring responses of individuals when they arepart of a school (reviewed by Krause 1994[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.60]). Instead, researchers have had to relyon measures such as “responsiveness” (the proportion of a group responding to astimulus; Blaxter et al. 1981 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.12]), theproportion of animals moving in a particular direction (Domenici & Batty 1997[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.33]), or “response latency” (the interval oftime between stimulus presentation and the first detectable movement of thefish; Domenici & Batty 1997 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.33]). With someof these measures, it can be difficult to distinguish between prey responses tothe approaching predator and responses to conspecifics. As fish group sizeincreases, it appears that both speed and accuracy of decision-making increasewhen under predatory threat (Ward et al. 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.101]). Tendency of individuals to joinshoals is presumed to be a trade-off between predation risk and foragingefficiency. In three-spined sticklebacks Gasterosteus aculeatus, bolderindividuals tend to be at the front of shoals where both predation risk andforaging opportunities are greater (Ward et al. 2004[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.102]). An individual animal’s antipredatorbehavior is therefore influenced by whether it is approached when alone or in agroup of fish (Domenici & Batty 1997 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.33]).6.3 PREDICTIONS UNDER THE ECONOMIC ESCAPE MODEL: 1. INCREASED RISK OF CAPTUREYdenberg and Dill (1986 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.111], 234) statedthat “If other things are equal, the risk of death in a given encounter with apredator should increase with the approach velocity of the predator and thedistance to effective cover; it should decrease with the attainable escapevelocity of the prey.” Simply (and assuming that other things are equal), wepredict that prey should therefore have longer flight initiation distance (FID),longer distance fled (DF), and faster escape speeds (“escape responses”) if theyface increased risk of capture (Table 6.1[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#aid-G6PNL]). We discuss empirical support for thesepredictions below.Table 6.1 Review of the literature for fish and amphibians, showing thepredictions of the EEM in terms of flight initiation distance (FID), distancefled (DF), and escape speed (arrows: ↑ increase predicted, ↓ decrease predicted)and the number of studies we located that either supported these predictions(highlighted cells) or did not (non-highlighted cells).Flight initiation distance (FID)Distance fled (FD)EscapespeedPredictionDecreasesSameIncreasesPredictionDecreasesSameIncreasesPredictionDecreasesSameIncreases1.Increased risk of capture↑↑if prey is slower↑↑e.g., environment of preyO2 or CO2level↑12–4↑43pollution↑5,6↑5parasitism↑6osmotic shock↑7ammonia inwater8temperature (heat shock)↑9If prey isbright and colorful↑↑distracted (e.g.,foraging, fighting)↑10–13↑experienced (can identifypredator)↑1414–18↑↓191616,19,20is exposed to intensive fishing↑21–27↑environmentinterferes with prey senses or responsesturbidity (decreasedvisibility)↑28–30↑3131greater distance to cover↑3225,32–34↑34predatormorepredators↑↑faster predator↑28,3536↑↑28,36persistent predator↑↑2.

Semeniuk & Dill (2006[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.90]).6.3.1 PREY ATTRIBUTES6.3.1.1 WHEN PREY IS SLOWERPrey locomotion has an effect on predator success. For example, a one standarddeviation increase in fast-start performance in guppies Poecilia reticulataincreases by two- to three-fold the odds of surviving a predation strike by pikecichlid Crenicichla alta (Walker et al. 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.100]). Predatory fish (Micropterussalmoides) are more likely to abort attacks and less likely to chase prey whentheir fish prey show higher acceleration performance (Webb 1986[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.108]).Escape speed in tadpoles is influenced by their body form (Dayton et al. 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.27]), as well as environment and previousexperience. Rana dalmatina tadpoles reared with pursuit predators (sticklebacks)can swim faster (and have longer and deeper tail muscles) than conspecificsraised with ambush predators (dragonfly larvae) or no predators (Teplitsky etal. 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.95]). In a comparison acrossspecies, in addition to speed, evasiveness and habitat use also influence risk:Bufo bufo tadpoles are highly susceptible to predation by dragonfly larvae dueto their constant slow movements, while Hyla arborea tadpoles, although slowgenerally, also showed high evasiveness, while R. dalmatina tadpoles were theleast susceptible being benthic and immobile but capable of high bursts of speed(Chovanec 1992 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.20]).Larger fish may not be targeted by gape-limited predators (Januchowski-Hartleyet al. 2011 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.54]), and larger fish can alsogenerally move faster than smaller fish (Videler 1993[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.97]). We discuss the effects of body size oncosts of fleeing in section 6.4.2 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#B-sec-60]. However,other factors may substantially affect swimming speed in fish. Water is 800times denser than air and hence it is more difficult to displace; consequently,movement through water causes more turbulence and drag and requires more energythan moving through air (Denny 1993 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.28]).Water also has lower oxygen levels than air (Denny 1993[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.28]). Because escape speed is so important,the physiological state of prey is important in determining whether their escapeis successful. Decreased oxygen levels, elevated CO2 and ammonia in water,pollution, parasitism, being injured or gravid, or subject to physiologicalshock (e.g., osmotic shock or heat shock) can all contribute to impaired escapein fish, generally due to impaired neural function and locomotion. Under thepredictions of the EEM, this decreased mobility would increase risk of captureand should influence FID as fish respond with greater caution on account oftheir increased vulnerability; however, most empirical findings contradict thesepredictions. A number of studies have found no difference in FID of fish subjectto low oxygen levels (Lefrancois & Domenici 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.66]; Domenici et al. 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.35]). Similarly, Lefrancois et al. (2005[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.67]) reported no difference in escape speed;while Lefrancois and Domenici (2006 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.66])reported an increase in escape speed. Krause et al. (2010[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.62]) report no effect of parasitism on FID.Similarly, Alvarez et al. (2006 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.3]) andKrause et al. (2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.62]) found no change inFID for fish exposed to pollution, while Alvarez et al. (2006[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.3]) also found no effect on escape speed.Handeland et al. (1996 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.47]) reported adecrease in escape distance due to osmotic shock, McKenzie et al. (2009[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.74]) reported a decrease in escape speed asa result of ammonia in the water, while Webb and Zhang (1994[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.109]) report a decrease in FID as aconsequence of heat shock. Recent studies investigating the effects of exposureto increased CO2 levels in water demonstrate reduced responsiveness for preydamselfish Pomacentrus amboinensis, although their dottyback Pseudochromisfuscus predators also succumb to the effects of increased CO2 and suffer reducedcapture success when similarly exposed (Allan et al. 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.2]).Since alertness (i.e., visual, auditory etc. responses contribute to FID) andlocomotion (escape speed and duration, escape trajectories) are our usualmeasures of escape responses, the effects of injury and other impairment areconfounded with the measures that we are making. Additionally, the predictionsof the EEM are clouded in regard to injuries. If risk increases due to injury orother impairment (e.g., survival of tadpoles with tails damaged in previouspredatory encounters is reduced; Semlitsch 1990[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.91]) then FID, DF, etc., should increase,but if the same condition increases the cost of fleeing, then it is likely todecrease responses. If it does both, then it is possible that there areambiguous escape responses, and the animal may be more likely to resort tochanges in habitat use.6.3.1.2 WHEN PREY IS BRIGHT AND COLORFULThe polymorphic frog Oophaga granulifera can rely more on crypsis oraposematism, depending on variation in conspicuousness, and this variation isalso reflected in escape behavior, with FID in response to a bird model beinghigher for more conspicuous red morphs than for cryptic green morphs orintermediate morphs (Willink et al. 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.110]). Despite the diversity of colorpatterns in fish, we found no studies that tested the effects of prey colorationon their escape responses. It may be that brightly colored fish tend to rely onalternative defenses (e.g., including spines and toxins; section 6.5[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#A-sec-43]).6.3.1.3 WHEN PREY IS DISTRACTEDPrey that are engaged in other activities may be exposed to increased risk dueto diverted attention (Chan & Blumstein 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.19]). The foraging position of guppiesinfluenced their vulnerability to predation since guppies foraging with theirheads down were more vulnerable and more likely to be attacked by a cichlidpredator. However, guppies foraging with their heads down showed shorter FIDsthan animals that were foraging horizontally or those that were not foraging atall (Krause & Godin 1996 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.61]). Non-foragingguppies reacted sooner, having longer FIDs, and horizontally foragingindividuals reacted before downward-foraging individuals (Krause & Godin 1996[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.61]). Bohórquez-Herrera et al. (2013[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.14]) similarly showed silver-spottedsculpins Blepsias cirrhosus had reduced responsiveness during prey handling(compared with non-foraging or fish that were targeting prey).As another form of “distraction,” golden dwarf cichlids Nannacara anomalaengaged in fights demonstrate a decrease in FID (Jakobsson et al. 1995[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.53]). In the presence of a predator model,fighting males changed their fighting behavior, showing more lateral display andtail beating (presumably behaviors that allow them to simultaneously monitortheir environment) in preference over mouth wrestling (Brick 1998[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.15]).6.3.1.4 WHEN PREY HAS PREVIOUS EXPERIENCEThe cognitive abilities of fish are more developed than most might assume(Laland et al. 2003 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.64]). Previousexperience with predators can influence subsequent behavior of fish: intensivecatch and release of rainbow trout Oncorhyncus mykiss by anglers results in arapid decline in catch rates within seven to ten days, suggesting that caughtand released fish learnt to ignore hooks (Askey et al. 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.7]). Guppies learn to avoid trawl nets byescaping through a hole; a skill that was socially transmitted through observingpreviously trained conspecifics (Reader et al. 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.84]).Consistent with the predictions of the EEM, as a result of experience with apredator, an increase in FID (Dill 1974b[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.30]; Healey & Reinhardt 1995[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.49]; D’Anna et al. 2004[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.25]; Malavasi et al. 2004[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.70]; Arai et al. 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.6]), DF (Ghalambor et al. 2004[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.42]), and escape speed (Dill 1974b[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.30]; Ghalambor et al. 2004[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.42]; Langerhans et al. 2004[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.65]) have been recorded. Some interestingvariations in escape response might suggest species differences as a consequenceof previous experience. For example, Healey and Reinhardt (1995[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.49]) reported changes in FID for experiencedcoho Oncorhynchus kisutch and chinook salmon O. tshawytscha over theirpredator-naïve responses: coho increased their FID (i.e., benefitted fromexperience and showed more flight behavior), but experienced chinook were morelikely to stay immobile. These two species therefore show different tactics inresponse to the same predator, with coho using “a strategy based on rapid andearly flight with, perhaps, a dependence on maneuverability and school cohesionto avoid capture” (Healey & Reinhardt 1995[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.49]: 621), a strategy that may be moresuccessful in the presence of safe refuge under natural conditions.Consistent with the predictions of the EEM, a number of studies reveal thatthere is an increase in FID in response to high levels of fishing compared withmarine reserves (Cole 1994 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.21]; Kulbicki1998 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.63]; Gotanda et al. 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.44]; Feary et al. 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.39]; Januchowski-Hartley et al. 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.54], 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.56], 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.55]; Figure 6.3[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#FIGm-fig-44]). This may reflect social learning amongindividuals that are able to escape, or alternatively, increased FID may simplytell us that we have removed all the less wary (i.e., more curious) individualsfrom the population (Sutter et al. 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.94]). Fish targeted by spear-fishing alsoalter their use of refuge as a result of exposure to fishing – at protectedreefs, sea breams Diplodus sargus and D. vulgaris frequently swam into theclosest shelters, whereas in fished reefs they mostly escaped in open water(Guidetti et al. 2008 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.46]).[OEBPS_Images_image00939.jpeg]Figure 6.3Relationship between FID for surgeon fishes (Acanthuridae) and distance from amarine reserve boundary. The different shaded dots represent data from threesites.(Januchowski-Hartley et al. 2013 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.55])Fish will often show predator inspection behavior, where a prey fish fixates ona predator, and slowly swims toward it (Pitcher et al. 1986[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.81]). While inherently risky, this behaviormay allow assessment of predator intent and dissuasion of predation, while alsoadvertising fitness to potential mates (Sutter et al. 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.94]). However, this behavior may make fishesparticularly vulnerable to spear fishers, bringing them closer to the fisher,and highlighting the fish as a target. Consequently, differences in responses byvarious fish families to fishing pressures may reflect differences in longevity,trophic level, availability of and differential use of refuges, or potentiallygroup size (influencing social learning) (Januchowski-Hartley et al. 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.54], 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.55]).6.3.2 WHEN THE PREDATOR REPRESENTS MORE RISKA faster predator will represent greater risk, and therefore prey should showincreased escape responses (Table 6.1 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#aid-G6PNL]).There is empirical support of these predictions for fish, but we have found nodata for amphibians in this respect. Dill (1974a[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.29]) reported longer FID in zebra danios(Brachydanio rerio) in the presence of a faster approaching model of a predator,but others (Fuiman 1993 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.41]; Meager et al.2006 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.76]) reported shorter FID in Clupeaharengus and Gadus morhua, respectively. Interestingly, we found no publishedempirical tests of the effects of number of predators present or the persistenceof predators on escape responses.6.3.3 WHEN THE ENVIRONMENT INTERFERES WITH PREY SENSES OR RESPONSES6.3.3.1 TURBIDITY (DECREASED VISIBILITY)Conditions that make it harder to detect a predator (and therefore greater riskof the predator approaching while the prey is unaware) should elicit greaterresponsiveness in potential prey following predictions of the EEM. The problemis how to measure this change in responses. In an environment where visibilityis reduced due to turbidity, the distance at which a predator is detected may bereduced below the optimal FID in clear conditions; therefore flight may beinstantaneous on detection of a predator, but FID would be decreased. Numerousstudies have shown that turbidity is correlated with decreased FID (Miner &Stein 1996 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.78]; Semeniuk & Dill 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.89]; Meager et al. 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.76]). Prey therefore have less time to evadethe predator in turbid water (Meager et al. 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.76]). There are, however, other ways ofreacting to this increased risk. When in turbid water, fathead minnowsPimephales promelas display significantly fewer dashes in response to a visualpredator stimulus, but fishes moved significantly further and faster in turbidwaters (Hartman & Abrahams 2000 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.48]).6.3.3.2 GREATER DISTANCE TO COVERPredictions of the EEM suggest that animals show an increase in escape responseswith greater distance to cover (Table 6.1[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#aid-G6PNL]). Data for fish indicate an increase inFID with greater distance to cover (Grant & Noakes 1987[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.45]; McLean & Godin 1989[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.75]; Dill 1990[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.31]; Gotanda et al. 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.44]). Dill (1990[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.31]) recorded no difference in fish escapespeed with distance to cover.6.4 PREDICTIONS UNDER THE ECONOMIC ESCAPE MODEL: 2. INCREASED COST OF FLEEINGIf fleeing is costly, prey should show shorter FID (Ydenberg & Dill 1986[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.111]: 237), and shorter DF (Table 6.1[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#aid-G6PNL]). It is possible that escape speed wouldalso be slower. We discuss empirical support for these predictions below.6.4.1 LOSS OF CRYPSISAs soon as an animal starts to move away from an approaching predator, it willforfeit any potential benefit of crypsis (Ydenberg & Dill 1986[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.111]), and therefore cryptic animals maybenefit from not responding immediately to the presence of a predator. Ydenbergand Dill (1986 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.111]) also cover the effectsof crypsis under “alternative strategies” (see section 6.5.1[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#A-sec-43]). Cryptic animals should only move awaywhen the benefits of moving outweigh those of remaining stationary. Martín etal. (2006 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.73]) reported decreased FID forgreen frogs in the absence of vegetation; the frogs presumably allowed anobserver to approach closer, remained for long periods immobile and cryptic, dueto their green or brown skin coloration.6.4.2 BODY SIZEThe size of a fish may be correlated with measures of fitness such asreproductive value, which may in turn influence risk assessment. Warner (1998[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.105]) found that female bluehead wrasseThallosoma bifasciatum, which are iteroparous, are relatively risk averse, whichmay reflect residual reproductive value of individuals. Larger fish can, ingeneral, move faster than smaller fish (Videler 1993[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.97]). Importantly, however, the methods ofswimming vary with body size in fish. In parrotfish, there is a link betweenbody size and type of swimming locomotion (Miller et al. 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.77]). Larger fish are more likely to useless costly but relatively slower escape (paired fin swimming), whereas smallerfish use an energetically more costly, but relatively faster escape (body andcaudal fin swimming) (Figure 6.4 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#FIGm-fig-45]). Underthe EEM, both decreased cost and slower swimming (in larger fish) would predictgreater FID. Supporting these predictions, various studies report an increase inFID with body size (Webb 1981 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.107]; Grant &Noakes 1987 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.45]; Gotanda et al. 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.44]; Januchowski-Hartley et al. 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.54]; Miller et al. 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.77])(but see Abrahams 1995[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.1]; and Feary et al. 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.39] who report no effect).[OEBPS_Images_image00940.jpeg]Figure 6.4(a) In response to being approached by a snorkeler, small parrotfish are morelikely to use body and caudal fin swimming (BCF), while large fish are morelikely to swim away using slower paired fin swimming. (b) In the same study,there is a positive relationship between FID and body size across 95 parrotfish(three species combined).(Miller et al. 2011 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.77])In Southern Leopard frogs Lithobates sphenocephalus, larger frogs are morelikely to hide in cover away from water than smaller ones (Bateman & Fleming2014 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.8]). When disturbed, they are morelikely to resort to cover on land than smaller frogs, which retreat to water(Bateman & Fleming 2014 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.8]). Ontogeneticchanges in size can also influence escape tactics in tadpoles: Rana sylvaticatadpoles swim slowest when they are newly hatched and just prior tometamorphosis, which are also presumed to be the times when they are mostsusceptible to predation (Brown & Taylor 1995[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.18]). At these times, they also show thehighest propensity to engage in rapid turning behavior and ability to maneuverat sharper angles, which may compensate for decreased speed (Brown & Taylor 1995[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.18]).6.4.3 OPPORTUNITY COSTSEscaping from a stimulus that is not threatening will ensure immediate safety,but incurs high opportunity costs (Chapters 2[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#CN-bp-2], 5 [OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#CN-bp-5]).Therefore modulating responses is important, ensuring that the animal does notoverreact to non-lethal stimuli. Consistent with the EEM, the presence of a foodresource caused guppies (horizontally foraging ones only) to delay their flightcompared to fish that were not given any food (Krause & Godin 1996[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.61]). Similarly, unfed brook troutSalvelinus fontinalis decrease their FID in the presence of food (Grant & Noakes1987 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.45]). Feeding and antipredationbehavior may be independently neurally controlled (Blanchard et al. 1991[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.11]; Box 6.1[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#BOXm-box-1]); consequently, it may not be surprisingthat feeding activities can modulate antipredator responses.An example of cost due to forfeiting opportunity in amphibians is illustrated inBox 6.2 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#BOXm-box-2]. Developing embryos will hatchprematurely in the presence of an immediate threat, forfeiting the opportunityof additional time developing in terrestrial nests away from aquatic predators.Box 6.2 When you can’t wait aroundTadpole eggs are particularly vulnerable to predation during development andtherefore frogs may preferentially lay eggs in vegetation above waterways toprotect the eggs from aquatic predators. However, when approached by terrestrialpredators, it is advantageous for these developing eggs to hatch rapidly (Figure6.5 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#FIGm-fig-46]), dropping to the water below andfacing increased risk from aquatic predators as an underformed tadpole ratherthan face certain death (Warkentin, 1995[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.103]). The eggs are sensitive to vibrationsin their substrate, hatching up to 30% earlier than undisturbed nests(Warkentin, 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.104]).[OEBPS_Images_image00941.jpeg]Figure 6.5Chunk-headed snake Imantodes inornatus attacking an egg clutch of the treefrogAgalychnis callidryas.(Photo by Karen Warkentin).6.5 PREDICTIONS UNDER THE ECONOMIC ESCAPE MODEL: 3. EFFECTIVENESS OF ALTERNATIVEDEFENSE TACTICSEffective alternative defenses would reduce “the cost of remaining at a givendistance from an approaching predator” (Ydenberg & Dill 1986[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.111]: 239). Therefore prey having suchdefenses should be less reliant on escape behavior and modify their responsesaccordingly.6.5.1 CRYPSISCryptic animals are predicted to be less responsive than more visible prey underthe EEM. Several species of fish show counter-shading (Ruxton et al. 2004[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.86]) or cryptic coloration (Donnelly & Dill1984 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.36] and references therein). However,we found only one paper that specifically explored the influence of crypsis onescape behavior. Radabaugh (1989 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.83]) showedthat among male darters Etheostoma spp., those which exchanged cryptic colorsfor bright courtship colors became less likely to “freeze” and more likely toflee when approached by a simulated predatory threat.To maintain the effect of crypsis, some fish have modified their escapebehavior. Three species of nocturnal South American fish (the catfishesTetranematichthys quadrifilis and Helogenes marmoratus and the knifefishSteatogenys duidae) are camouflaged as leaves: two species even lie on theirsides, increasing their resemblance to fallen leaves (Sazima et al. 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.87]). When disturbed, they do not simplyswim away; two species drift off like waterlogged leaves, while H. marmoratusmoves up submerged root tangles, exposing its head and forebody, and lookinglike a leaf wedged in the roots.When on substrates that enhance their crypsis, cryptic Bokermannohyla alvarengaitadpoles swim only short distances after disturbances and again become immobile(Eterovick et al. 2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.38]). In adult frogs,immobility is crucial to maintaining crypsis, and is a major component ofbehavioral defense against predation. When approached by a human, over 90% ofindividuals belonging to five Craugastor species remained immobile until thepredator reached them (Cooper et al. 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.23]).6.5.2 ALTERNATIVE DEFENSES: POISONBecause some frogs are poisonous, they may rely less on escape due to theiraposomatic coloration and learned avoidance responses of predators. Cooper etal. (2009 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.24]) examined the escape responsesof poison dart frogs (Dendrobates auratus and Oophaga pumilio) and recorded lowescape reactions: short FID and short DF – essentially the frogs got out of theway of the person’s approach and then stopped moving again. Although there aremany venomous/poisonous fishes, it is surprising that there are no publicationstesting the predictions of the EEM in these animals.6.5.3 ARMOR: SPINES AND PLATESArmor is an effective form of defense in fish (e.g., Lescak & von Hippel 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.68]). The influence of armor on escapebehavior has been examined in fish, comparing the behavior of different speciesor different populations of the same species that have varying levels of armor(e.g., spines or bony plates). Consistent with the EEM, such studies report adecrease in FID for armored fish (Abrahams 1995[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.1]), a decrease in escape distance (Andraso& Barron 1995 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.5]; Bergstrom 2002[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.10]), and a reduction in escape speed(Andraso & Barron 1995 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.5]; Andraso 1997[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.4]; Bergstrom 2002[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.10]).6.5.4 RETREAT TO SAFER SITESRetreating to cover is an important antipredator response in fish, frogs, andtadpoles. For example, several species of frog retreat to water from land whenapproached by humans (Martín et al. 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.72], 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.73]; Cooper 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.22]; Bateman & Fleming 2014[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.8]), which they use as cover (reviewed inChapter 9 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#CN-bp-9]).6.6 PREDICTIONS UNDER THE ECONOMIC ESCAPE MODEL: 4. GROUP SIZEYdenberg and Dill (1986 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.111]: 240) predictedthat “if risk of predation or foraging efficiency varies with group size, thenthis will be reflected in flight distances,” but did not predict the directionof these changes because group size and membership have many facets that mightaffect FID, possibly in opposing ways. Because most predators target a singleindividual, the presence of group members decreases the risk of predation foreach individual (risk dilution). The fitness benefits attached to groupmembership vary among group sizes, locations, food density, and predationregimes (Chapter 2 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#CN-bp-2]).Group membership can present an advantage of early warning (the “many eyes”hypothesis). Consequently, alert distance can be greater, and, since AD and FIDare correlated, FID would be predicted to be greater for groups than solitaryindividuals: the whole group flees according to the most reactive individual.This has been tested with small groups of green frogs Rana perezi (Martín et al.2006 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.73]), but there was no difference inFID between solitary individuals and the first (most reactive) individual ofsmall groups of up to four frogs. Similarly, Godin and Morgan (1985[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.43]) found no difference in FID in responseto a fish predator model between solitary and schooling banded killifishFundulus diaphranus, and FID was statistically constant over a wide range ofschool sizes. However, other studies have found that escape responses vary withgroup size. Data for stingrays supports the early warning hypothesis (Semeniuk &Dill 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.89], 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.90]) (Box 6.3[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#BOXm-box-3]). Interestingly, Abrahams (1995[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.1]) showed that FID was shorter in grouped(n = 3) than solitary brook sticklebacks Culea incostans, suggesting that theseanimals were more sensitive to the effects of risk dilution than early warning.Because premature, or unwarranted responses to being approached can be costly,it is possible that the effects of group sizes on FID sometimes may only comeinto play when a minimal proportion of the group responds.Box 6.3 Selective stingraysConsistent with the early warning hypothesis, approaching cowtail stingraysPastinachus sephen with a mock predator model, Semeniuk and Dill (2005[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.89]) showed greater FID for the firstcowtail in a group to flee compared with solitary cowtails. Cowtails will oftensettle next to reticulate whiprays Himantura uarnak, which have longer tails(Figure 6.6 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#FIGm-fig-47]), show earlier responsesthan cowtails to a threat (approaching boat), and were most frequently the firstto respond when in a mixed group (Semeniuk & Dill 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.90]). The whiprays have longer tails and mayhave an advantage in increased likelihood of predator detection via themechanoreceptors found along the length of the tail. In 34 mixed-species groups,whiprays responded first 25 times (73%), although they made up only 49% of themembership of these groups. Whiprays could be preferred resting partners underconditions of poor visibility due to differences in predator-responsecapabilities between these two species. Cowtails also preferentially settle nextto artificial ray shapes (unpainted marine plywood decoys) made with a longertail, inspecting the tails before settling.[OEBPS_Images_image00942.jpeg]Figure 6.6(a) Reticulate whiprays LHS have longer tails than (b) sympatric cowtailstingrays RHS.Another consideration is the effect of group size on DF. If group cohesion islost while fleeing, then perhaps DF should be shorter in a group. However, itappears that fish cohesion and reaction and response to predatory threatactually improve with increasing group size (Ward et al. 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.101]).In Cuban tree frog tadpoles Osteopilus septentrionalis, fewer tadpoles swam awayfrom a predatory stimulus from above when housed in higher density groups(Bateman & Fleming 2015 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.9]). Among thosethat swim away, distance swum is shorter for tadpoles in smaller groups (Bateman& Fleming 2015 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.9]).6.7 CONCLUSIONSAs we reviewed the literature for this chapter, it became obvious that there isa massive literature on the escape responses of fishes, much of which is largelyignored in the literature of terrestrial taxa. Many key principles of the EEMhave been tested in fish species, with varying results. Many studies do notsupport the simple predictions of the EEM (Table 6.1[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#aid-G6PNL]), either because the animals do not showmeasurable variation in their responses, or sometimes because they showresponses that contradict the direction of our predictions. We have highlighteda few studies where careful examination of the responses of these animals can beexplained through physiological effects of their environment, and it is clearthat this needs to be considered carefully in terms of escape responses infishes.With regard to amphibians, it is surprising how little of the ecology of theirantipredator escape has been explored. Ontogenetic change in antipredatorresponses as tadpoles metamorphose and move from water to land is an importantaspect of the adaptation of frogs to life on land that reflects vulnerability todifferent suites of predators. Understanding these responses is likely to be animportant tool for conservation management of frogs in these days of diminishingamphibian populations worldwide.Finally, studies of escape behavior may provide information useful as aconservation tool for various taxa (Chapter 17[OEBPS_Text_part0032.xhtml#CN-bp-17]). Escape behavior has been used as ameasure of human impact on fish and frogs, and hence may prove useful forconservation of these animals (Blumstein & Fernández-Juricic 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.13]). For frogs, FID has been used toidentify the effects of repeated exposure to human traffic for endangeredIberian frogs Rana iberica and to develop setback distances (Rodríguez-Prieto &Fernández-Juricic 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.85]). Escape behaviorhas also been widely used as a measure of environmental pollution on animals.For example, fish born of mothers exposed to methyl mercury demonstrateconcentration-dependent effects on survival skills, including impairment ofescape speeds(Alvarez et al. 2006 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.3]). Ranablairi tadpoles exposed to sublethal levels of carbaryl (an insecticide) havereduced swimming performance and activity, which may result in increasedpredation and generate changes at the local population level (Bridges 1997[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.16]). Recent observations that increased CO2levels in water can impede escape responses (Allan et al. 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.2]) rings warning bells for climate changepredictions.Escape behavior in fishes has been shown to be a powerful indicator of fishingintensity or even occasional poaching (Cole 1994[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.21]; Gotanda et al. 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.44]; Feary et al. 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.39]; Januchowski-Hartley et al. 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.54], 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.55]), and therefore could be used to gaugelevels of compliance with no-take regulations of marine reserves. Escapemeasures are arguably more tractable for studies requiring high levels ofreplication than other survey methods (Figure 6.7[OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#FIGm-fig-48]), and are sensitive even to low levelsof fishing (Feary et al. 2011 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.39];Januchowski-Hartley et al. 2012 [OEBPS_Text_part0017.xhtml#REFe-r-6.56]).[OEBPS_Images_image00943.jpeg]Figure 6.7Flight initiation distance estimates (mean ± SE) for three observers (differentshading) approaching fish in a fished or no-take marine reserve (NTR), usingeither scuba or free diving, and carrying a fishing spear or not.

Fleming7.1 INTRODUCTIONInvertebrates comprise an estimated 80% of all multicellular animals.Understanding their antipredator responses therefore makes a substantialcontribution to our knowledge of animal responses to predators. The diversity ofinvertebrates, including a range of lifestyles, body forms, and habitat use,means that day to day, they encounter a similarly wide range of riskysituations. Surprisingly, however, there are actually few studies that haveexamined invertebrate escape behavior from the point of view of the EconomicEscape Model (EEM). Of the studies carried out, there has been a bias towarddecapods (e.g., crabs), with notable contributions from Lepidoptera(particularly moths), Orthoptera (crickets and grasshoppers), and Arachnida(spiders).It is possible that the paucity of data for invertebrate escape behavior may bedue to methodological challenges. Firstly, multicellular invertebrates aregenerally smaller than vertebrates. Invertebrates might therefore face a widerrange of predator sizes than vertebrates, including a higher likelihood of“accidental” predation through events such as being ingested with foliage byherbivores (Ben-Ari & Inbar 2013 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.11]).Because they are so small in size, we need to be cautious to not overinterpretthe responses of invertebrates. While, to human observers, it may be intuitivehow vertebrates react to approaching predators or disturbance (e.g., “alert”behavior, cessation of previous behavior, gaze direction, alarm calling), thisis less clear for many invertebrates. Secondly, invertebrates perceive theirworld through a wide range of sensory modalities: in addition to sight andsound, they also respond to chemicals, air pressure, vibration or changes inlight level. Locusts, for example, detect potential threats through a wide rangeof senses (Table 7.1 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#TBLm-tblw-12]). These differentmodes of sensitivity to their environment often mean that we have to think“outside the box” when working with invertebrates, to ensure that we correctlyassess the stimuli and consequent responses.Table 7.1 Avoidance behavior of locusts in response to stimuli has beendescribed for several sensory modalities.ReceptorsResponsesMechanoreceptorsTactile hair receptors on different regions ofthe body can elicit specific avoidance responses ranging from simple retractionof a leg to active defense.e.g., wind receptors: setae on the dorsal surface ofthe head, which when stimulated with air currents, cause wing flapping for aslong as the wind flows (Camhi 1969[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.13]).Auditory input from ultrasound sourcesinduces avoidance steering.ChemoreceptorsChemical cues from leg contactchemoreceptors elicit avoidance by setting the tarsus into a newposition.ThermoreceptorsHeat (infrared radiation) is avoided by flyinglocusts.PhotoreceptorsVisual cues reliably initiate the aversive reactions ofcollision avoidance in flying locusts. Expanding shapes elicit steeringresponses that have been interpreted as collision-avoidance strategies indifferent flight situations. Several large visual interneurones descending fromthe brain react to expanding shapes and may therefore contribute to thesevisually elicited avoidance responses.(Modified from Hassenstein & Hustert, 1999[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.37], and references therein)Identifying common responses to being approached by a predator can be achallenge in interpreting invertebrate antipredator behavior. However, this ishelped by recognizing that their escape behavior can be effectively pared downto the simplest responses to stimuli. A recent review (Card 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.14]) emphasizes that there are relativelyfew synapses involved in insect escape behavior, reducing processing time andconsequently resulting in remarkably rapid responses. However, Card (2012[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.14]) also points out that even the escape ofa fly is a series of “sub-behaviors” that allow adaptive abortion of theprocess, i.e., it is not a fixed action pattern and is therefore potentiallyhighly flexible.In addition to their diversity and abundance, invertebrates can also carryevidence of past predatory encounters, which may modify their responses. Manyinvertebrates undergo autotomy – the voluntary shedding of a limb or other partof the body along a breakage plane (reviewed by Fleming et al. 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.31]). Autotomy happens as a result ofentrapment (usually when grabbed by a potential predator), and therefore anautotomized body part directly reflects a successful previous escape. Mostinvertebrates that have lost a leg have reduced locomotory ability (reviewed byFleming et al. 2007 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.31]). Animals may alsoautotomize an appendage that could have been used in self-defense, e.g., thechelipeds of crabs (Juanes & Smith 1995[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.49]). Autotomy can therefore render anindividual more vulnerable to future encounters with a predator (McPeek et al.1996 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.61]; Stoks 1998[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.80], 1999[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.81]; Gyssels & Stoks 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.36]; Bateman & Fleming 2006a[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.3]) and will potentially influence economicescape decisions (Cooper & Frederick 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.20]).7.2 MEASURES OF INVERTEBRATE ESCAPE RESPONSEInvertebrates use a diversity of antipredator behavior, including cessation ofmovement, falling silent, dropping, taking flight (walking, running, or flying),or retreating to cover, as appropriate to their environment, morphology, andecology (Figure 7.1 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#FIGm-fig-49]). In this section,we discuss these antipredator responses in terms of the measures that can bemade.[OEBPS_Images_image00944.jpeg]Figure 7.1A range of behavioral options are available for invertebrates that usually arefound within vegetation, fly, or are epigeic. Crypsis is an important primarydefense (functioning regardless of whether a predator is present or not; sensuEdmunds 1974 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.29]), but when crypsis fails,invertebrates must resort to a range of secondary defense responses.7.2.1 WATCHING AND WAITINGMeasuring predator monitoring in invertebrates can be problematic because, to ahuman observer, it is not always evident when an invertebrate is “alert” to thepredator’s presence or has modified its behavior accordingly (i.e., is“monitoring” its environment). Below we discuss where monitoring is evidentbecause animals stop their previous actions, alter their body position, orretreat to cover.Fiddler crabs Uca vomeris visually monitor approaching predatory stimuli untildeciding to retreat to their burrows (Hemmi 2005a[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.40], b[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.41]), but also continue to monitor them fromthe entrance of their burrows before retreating wholly (Hemmi & Pfeil 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.42]). Uca pugilator fiddler crabs retreat toburrows if they see conspecifics reacting to threats, even if they do not seethe threat themselves (Wong et al. 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.85]). Uca pugilator are therefore monitoringtheir conspecifics for cues about potential predators.7.2.1.1 CESSATION OF MOVEMENTCessation of movement, tonic immobility, or thanatosis (where the organismeffectively plays dead) is a first line of defense for several invertebratespecies. Stopping moving is typical of cryptic species (e.g., Hatle & Faragher1998 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.38]). Xanthodius sternberghii crabsdisturbed by human activity initially rely on keeping still (which is effectivedue to their cryptic coloration), but, after a minute, the crabs will eitherslowly edge for cover or imperceptibly dig themselves into the sand (Robinson etal. 1970 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.73]).Larvae of the damselfly Ischnura elegans that have autotomized lamellae (usedfor gas exchange and locomotion) through unsuccessful predation events enterthanatosis more frequently when exposed to a predatory stimulus than intactindividuals (Gyssels & Stoks 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.36]). Inponds where these damselfly larvae have only invertebrate predators, this formof defense may be sufficient to avoid predation. However, predatory fish areable to locate larvae whether they are immobile of not, and larvae from pondswith fish predators are less likely to become immobile and stay immobile forshorter lengths of time than are larvae from ponds without fish predators.Ohno and Miyatake (2007 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.67]) demonstrated atrade-off (a negative genetic correlation) between different responses(thanatosis and flying ability) to potential predation in bean beetlesCallosobruchus chinensis. This suggests that, within a population, there may begroups of individuals that are more or less likely to resort to one of these twomutually exclusive antipredator tactics. The propensity of ceasing movement alsoappears to be influenced by what an individual was doing before being disturbed.Sweet potato beetles Cylas formicarius that were moving when disturbed are lesslikely to enter thanatosis compared with individuals that were already still(Miyatake 2001 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.65]).Cessation of movement probably comes with minimal energetic costs, but since weknow very little about the mechanisms that cause tonic immobility ininvertebrates, it is difficult to assess whether there are any indirect effectsof monitoring risk until they recommence movement. The biggest costs to suchbehavior are likely to be opportunity costs and cost of monitoring theenvironment.7.2.1.2 FALLING SILENTFor organisms that signal acoustically, falling silent is another way ofenhancing crypsis when a potential predator is detected. Orthopterans that areacoustically signaling cease movement and fall silent when disturbed by apredatory stimulus (Hedrick 2000 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.39];Bateman & Fleming 2013b [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.8]). Male armoredground crickets, Acanthoplus speiseri, stridulate both during the day and night.They fall silent and initially rely on crypsis when approached by a human. Thesecrickets use visual cues to recognize the intruder during the day, stoppingcalling when the person is still some distance away, but at night they can beapproached and touched before they fall silent (Bateman & Fleming 2013b[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.8]).Animals may then remain silent for varying lengths of time; this latency untilthe resumption of signaling may be influenced by risk assessment. Their latencyto resume signaling is influenced by perceived presence of predators (Zuk &Kolluru 1998 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.86]; Lewkiewicz & Zuk 2004[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.56]) but it can also vary according toprevious experience with predators: crickets that autotomized a limb in apredatory encounter and thus have reduced locomotory ability (Bateman & Fleming2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.2], 2006a[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.3]) increase and maintain a high latency tobegin calling again postdisturbance (Bateman & Fleming 2006b[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.4]).7.2.1.3 “POSITIONING” BEHAVIORBetween cessation of moving and active flight away from a predator is a smallsuite of behavioral actions that we term “positioning behavior.” Manygrasshoppers perched on vegetation reposition themselves on the other side of astem or leaf from the approaching predator (“squirreling”). Otherpositioning/hiding responses include “jerking” (short, lateral movements),“crouching,” and small backward motions (Hassenstein & Hustert 1999[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.37]). Locusts Locusta migratoria squirrelaround stem perches in response to visual stimuli, i.e., dark, moving, orexpanding shapes. Interestingly, they do not respond to acoustic stimuli,although noises prior to a visual stimulus may increase their propensity to hide(Hassenstein & Hustert 1999 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.37]).The likelihood of squirreling may be influenced by body condition. Semi-aquaticgrasshoppers Paroxya atlantica that had autotomized a hind limb show a greaterlikelihood to squirrel from an approaching observer than intact individuals(Bateman & Fleming 2011 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.6]). They also perchlower on emergent vegetation than intact individuals, presumably in readinessfor escape via water.This sort of behavior is likely to be energetically inexpensive, is less likelyto attract a predator’s attention than fleeing, has a lower latency until normalbehavior can be resumed, and allows continued monitoring of the predator.7.2.2 FLEEINGIf keeping still and/or silent is not sufficient to avoid detection by apredator, prey have the option to flee. The various forms of fleeing reflect thewide range of prey biology.7.2.2.1 DROPPINGThe simplest form of “fleeing,” which is common to many arthropods on vegetationor in flight, is to drop vertically toward the ground (aided by gravity), out ofthe way of the predator or an approaching disturbance. Colonial spidersMetepeira incrassata drop out of communal nests into vegetation below whenpredatory wasps attack the nest (Uetz et al. 2002[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.83]). Caterpillars of the lymantrid mothOrgyia leucostigma rely on their coating of bristly hairs, not only as a primarydefense of a barrier against attack, but also as sensors (Castellanos et al.2011 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.15]). Low hair-bending velocity resultsin the caterpillar walking away from the disturbance, but high hair-bendingvelocity results in dropping from their perch, presumably as it is interpretedas a higher risk predatory stimulus.Dropping is an important antipredator response of flying invertebrates. Variousinsects have evolved the ability to acoustically detect predatory bats anddramatically drop from the air to avoid them. Green lacewings Chrysopa carneafold their wings and nose dive in response to the echolocation calls of bats(Miller & Olesen 1979 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.62]). Many species ofmoths, crickets, bush crickets, mantids, and some flies and beetles show similarbat-avoidance behavior (Miller & Surlykke 2001[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.63]). Female parasitic flies Ormia ochraceaperform phonotaxis at night to their victims, which are singing male crickets(Rosen et al. 2009 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.75]). Like femalecrickets performing phonotaxis to the males, these flies also drop from the airin response to bat echolocation calls.Arthropods also drop from plants even when the disturbance is unintentional.Aphids drop when herbivores feed on the plants they are on (Gish et al. 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.32], 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.33]). Up to 14% of pea aphids Acyrthosiphonpisum feeding on alfalfa bushes drop to the ground when hemipteran predators areintroduced to the bush, and up to 60% of the aphids drop when the highlypredatory ladybird Coccinella septempunctata is placed on the bush (Losey &Denno 1998 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.58]). Pea aphids also drop fromfood plants when they detect alarm pheromones from conspecifics indicatingactive predation (Dill et al. 1990 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.25]).Both larvae and adults of three coccinellid beetle species drop when mammalianherbivores feed on the plants they are on (Ben-Ari & Inbar 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.11]). When breathed on by humans, 60 to 80%of the beetles drop, probably reacting to heat and humidity, but they do notdrop if the plant is merely shaken (Ben-Ari & Inbar 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.11]).Dropping comes with costs, such as cessation of feeding, desiccation (forsap-feeding insects), increased locomotory costs in regaining their position, orgreater exposure to animals on the ground. Pea aphids therefore “assess” riskand are less likely to drop when the environment is hot and dry, or when theyare feeding on high-quality rather than low-quality host plants (Dill et al.1990 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.25]). Because dropping is costly, thereneeds to be good discrimination between reasonably safe situations vs. trulydangerous stimuli. The dogbane tiger moth Cycnia tenera can differentiatebetween the echolocation calls of bats that are flying nearby looking for prey(“early attack”) and calls of these bats that have detected prey and are movinginto pursuit (“late attack”). When first exposed to bat echolocation callspost-adult molt, moths show equal defensive responses (“startle” calls ofultrasonic clicks and dropping) to both types of call, but soon learn todiscriminate between them, and subsequently will continue other behavior in thepresence of “early attack” echolocation calls (Ratcliffe et al. 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.69]). Similar differentiation between“early” and “late” echolocation calls has been recorded for the moth Bertholdiatrigona (Corcoran et al. 2013 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.21]).7.2.2.2 TAKING FLIGHT: WALKING, RUNNING, FLYING, OR SWIMMINGWhen an invertebrate flees from an approaching predator there are variousmeasures that can reveal important information about this response. Measuresinclude FID, DF, angle of flight away from the predator, and the type of flightused (i.e., fast or slow; straight or protean).7.2.2.2.1 FLIGHT INITIATION DISTANCE (FID)Under predictions of the EEM, FID should increase in the presence of greaterrisk (Chapter 2 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#CN-bp-2]). A number of studiesapparently support FID as a measure of level of risk in invertebrates (Table 7.2[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#TBLm-tblw-13]). Cooper (2006[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.18]) recorded an increase in FID inDissosteira carolina grasshoppers that were approached faster, more directly, ortwice in succession, while Hemmi (2005a [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.40])showed that fiddler crabs Uca vomeris approached by a model seabird showedincreased FID when they were further from their burrow.Table 7.2 Studies of FID in response to varying threat levels to test the EEM ininvertebrates.Prey organismStimulusTreatmentWas there a difference inFID?ReferenceGrasshoppers– Dissosteira carolinaPersonApproach speedYes ↑ forfaster approach[1]Directness of approachYes ↑ for direct approach[1]RepeatedapproachYes ↑ for 2nd approach[1]– Schistocerca alutaceaPersonApproachedrepeatedlyNo[2]– Psinidia fenestralisPersonApproached repeatedlyNo (Marginally ↑FID on the second approach, but not for subsequent approaches)[2]– ParoxyaatlanticaPersonAutotomized vs. intactNo[3]Armored ground crickets AcanthoplusspeiseriPersonCalling males, at night and in the dayYes ↓ at night[4]Mayflylarvae Baetis tricaudatusPredatory fish and stonefly larvaeHigh- vs. low-foodpatches[5]– Large larvaeYes ↓ (¼ ×) in high-food patchesa[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#TFN-fn-7.1.1]– Small larvaeNoWater strider GerrisremigisAdult water striders approaching juvenilesGroup size of juvenilesYes ↑for larger groups, then ↓ for even larger groups[6]Wolf spiders HognacarolinensisModel lizardMass, size, sex, and speed of spidersYes ↓for slowerindividuals[7].Colonial spiders Metepeira incrassataPredatory waspPosition innest, age of spidersYes ↑ for adult females in center of nest (furthest frominitiation of wasp attack: No for immature spiders)[8]Orb weaver spiders ArgiopefloridaPerson or shapePerson “looming” or small fluttering shape “hovering”Nob[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#TFN-fn-7.1.2][9]Fiddler crabs Uca vomerisModelseabirdDistance to refugeYes ↓ FID when closer to refuge[10]Angle of approach(directly or tangentially)Yes ↓ FID when approached directly[11]Caribbean hermitcrabs Coenobita clypeatusPerson or shapeSilent or noisy approachYes ↓ “FID”(withdrawing into shell) when distracted by noise[12]a [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#TFN-fn-7.1.1-back] FID through drift in the streamflow.b [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#TFN-fn-7.1.2-back] Only effect was height of webfrom the ground, which could reflect differences in visual contrast from thevegetation.References: [1]: Cooper, 2006 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.18]; [2]:Bateman & Fleming, 2014 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.9]; [3]: Bateman &Fleming, 2011 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.6]; [4]: Bateman & Fleming,2013b [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.8]; [5]: Scrimgeour, et al., 1994[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.78]; [6]: Dill & Ydenberg, 1987[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.24]; [7]: Nelson & Formanowicz, 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.66]; [8]: Uetz et al. 2002[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.83]; [9]: Bateman & Fleming, 2013a[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.7]; [10]: Hemmi, 2005a[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.40]; [11]: Hemmi, 2005b[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.41]; [12]: Chan, et al. 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.16].Other studies, however, have recorded no increase in FID in response toincreased risk. Three other grasshopper species show little evidence for anincrease in FID when approached repeatedly or for autotomized grasshoppers(other escape tactics are instead evident, including increases in DF, alteringangle of escape, or use of crypsis) (Bateman & Fleming 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.6], 2014[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.9]). Autotomy can influence FID as loss oflimb may reduce locomotory ability, such that an increased FID would beadaptive, but lower initial fitness after autotomy, encouraging decreased FID(Cooper & Frederick 2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.20]). Thisrelationship needs more study in invertebrates. Orb-weaver spiders Argiopeflorida do not vary their FID in response to varying types of approach (Bateman& Fleming 2013b [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.8]). Hemmi (2005b[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.41]) reported that Uca vomeris actually showdecreased FID when approached directly (rather than tangentially), and Caribbeanhermit crabs Coenobita clypeatus similarly show decreased hiding initiationdistance (i.e., when they withdraw into their shell) when disturbed by noise(Chan et al. 2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.16]).We need to be cautious not to overinterpret the results of FID experiments ininvertebrates, since the physiological limitations of the animals may contributeto responses. Flight initiation distance may simply vary as a consequence ofvisual acuity (Box 7.1 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#BOXm-box-4]), or depthperception, or speed of cognitive processing (e.g., Dukas 1998[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.28]; Bateman & Fleming 2013a[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.7]; Lee et al. 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.55]), and individuals may therefore showlimited plasticity in FID. Consequently, we might not predict variation in FIDwithin individuals and populations, but we might expect variation betweenpopulations that vary in predation intensity that might, for example, select forindividuals with a lower response threshold.Box 7.1 Vision in arthropodsThe compound eyes of arthropods come in a number of general patterns. Bothsimple (or single chambered) and compound (or multifaceted) eyes split upincoming light according to its direction and origin. Compound eyes are of twodistinct and optically different kinds. In apposition eyes (most diurnalinsects), each cluster of receptors has their own lens. In superposition eyes,such as in Lepidoptera, the image at any point on the retina is the product ofmany lenses.Flight responses are triggered by a threshold size and/or speed of a “looming”image on the retina (Rind & Simmons 1992[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.72]; Javůrková et al. 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.47]). When the image reaches a thresholdsize (i.e., number of ommatadia neurons firing), then the escape response willbe triggered (Figure 7.2 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#FIGm-fig-50]). For example,hiding responses (squirreling to the other side of a branch from the approachingobject) in locusts Locusta migratoria, stimulated by expanding shapes, occuronly after the expanding image has exceeded a threshold visual angle of 8 to9.5° (Hassenstein & Hustert 1999 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.37]).[OEBPS_Images_image00945.jpeg]Figure 7.2(a) Basic structure of an appositon compound eye found in most diurnal insectspecies, showing its construction from ommatidial elements. (b) A looming shapewill cause an escape response when a threshold angle (i.e., number of ommatidiastimulated) are triggered. The distance from the eye when this occurs willtherefore determine the FID for the animal.Fleeing will result in opportunity costs as well as metabolic costs.Interestingly, flight in many invertebrates is particularly efficient, such thatthe metabolic costs of flight may be fairly minimal. The tracheal system ofinvertebrates such as a grasshopper is particularly efficient in ensuring oxygenavailability to metabolically active tissue, and consequently (unlikevertebrates, which will readily resort to anaerobic respiration during sprintescapes) they are unlikely to have to rely on anaerobic respiration (Weyel &Wegener 1996 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.84]). Lack of oxygen is rarefor such invertebrates (although it can certainly apply to aquatic invertebratesthat may encounter hypoxic zones) and, unlike many mammals and birds, they canmaintain high metabolic rates and ATP synthesis (Weyel & Wegener 1996[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.84]). Notably, however, “injury” throughautotomy of a limb can increase costs of locomotion and decrease stamina infield crickets (Fleming & Bateman 2007 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.30]).7.2.2.2.2 DISTANCE FLED (DF)In a high-risk situation (e.g., when approached by a fast, persistent predator),it would be beneficial to increase DF. Dissosteira carolina grasshoppersapproached quickly by a human observer showed greater FID than individualsapproached more slowly, but also fled further (Cooper 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.18]). In response to being approachedrepeatedly, Schistocerca alutacea grasshoppers did not increase FID but fledfarther, such that the pursuer failed to keep up with them (Bateman & Fleming2014 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.9]). Gryllus bimaculatus crickets canbe stimulated to flee by a puff of air on the cerci from behind. A single puffcauses a short run, but a continuous sequence of puffs causes sustained escaperunning and turning away from the stimulus source (Gras & Hörner 1992[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.34]). Mosquito pupae Culex pipiens close tothe surface of the water are presumably more at risk of aerial predation thanones that are deeper in the water column. When exposed to a simulated attackfrom above, they flee farther than ones that are initially deeper(Rodríguez-Prieto et al. 2006 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.74]).Increasing the DF comes with costs, since it removes the prey animal fartherfrom its original position, which may have been optimal for the individual.Increasing DF must also come at a metabolic cost, and the energy used forlocomotion will need to be later replaced through increased foraging.7.2.2.2.3 FLIGHT BEHAVIORFlight can be augmented as an effective escape tactic by varying the angle offlight (Chapter 8 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#CN-bp-8]). Assassin bugs Triatomainfestans consistently escape away from a stimulus at approximately 120°, whichcorresponds to the limits of their visual zone, thereby maximizing distance fromthe predator while still allowing the assassin bug to track it (Lazzari & Varjú1990 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.54]). However, repeatedly fleeing awayfrom a predator on a set trajectory may result in anticipation of this escaperesponse by the predator while, in some cases, completely random-directionfleeing may sometimes result in fleeing toward a predator (Card 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.14]).Unpredictable, changing, flight patterns (termed “protean” behavior) cantherefore be advantageous (Humphries & Driver 1970[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.46]; Jones et al. 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.48]; Chapter 8[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#CN-bp-8]). Cockroaches Periplaneta americana choosefrom a variety of escape trajectories that are at angles away from the threat(Domenici et al. 2008 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.27]). On the approachof a predator model, ocean skaters Halobates robustus not only increase escapespeed but also the frequency of turns on the water’s surface, performing proteanturning and moving (Treherne & Foster 1981[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.82]).The grasshopper Psinidia fenestralis shows a bimodal pattern of escapetrajectories, leaping either directly away from or at right angles to theobserver’s approach path (Bateman & Fleming 2014[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.9]) (Figure 7.3[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#FIGm-fig-51]). When approached repeatedly, however,the grasshoppers more consistently use lateral escape routes. Protean flight andflight lateral to the predator’s trajectory may be farther enhanced by wingcoloration in oedipodine grasshoppers (e.g., Dissosteira carolina, Cooper 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.18]; Oedipoda caerulescens, Kral 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.50]; Psinidia fenestralis, Bateman & Fleming2014 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.9]): the rapid disappearance of theircolorful underwings upon landing may enhance subsequent crypsis. Performing“hook” landings (e.g., Oedipoda caerulescens; Kral 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.50]), such that they face back the way theycame, makes it more difficult for predators to shift to a different kind ofsearch image to find their prey, and also improves monitoring of the approachingpredator. Interestingly, the cyrtacanthridine grasshopper S. alutacea, which hasnon-contrasting under-wings, tends to shift away from use of lateral escapepaths with persistent pursuit, and rely more on longer escape flights directlyaway from the observer (Bateman & Fleming 2014[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.9]). Paroxya atlantica grasshoppers thathave undergone autotomy of a limb always escape from a disturbance laterally(Bateman & Fleming 2011 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.6]).[OEBPS_Images_image00946.jpeg]Figure 7.3Movement of four grasshopper species in relation to the trajectory of anapproaching human observer. Angles of 180° indicate the animals moved directlyaway from the observer, angles around 90° indicate they moved awayperpendicularly to the observer’s approach path; escapes to the left- andright-hand side of the approach path have been pooled. Each circular line showsone individual. Data for (a) to (c) clearly show a bimodal distribution ofescape angles. Data for (b) to (d) were for the first approach of theseindividuals.(Bateman & Fleming 2011 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.6]; 2014[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.9]; we calculated (d) from Cooper, 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.18])7.2.2.3 RETREATING TO COVERSome organisms that flee have the option of hiding in refuges (Chapter 9[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#CN-bp-9]). Among invertebrates, some of the beststudied taxa for this behavior are fiddler crabs that retire towardself-constructed burrows when approached by predatory stimuli (e.g., Hemmi 2005a[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.40],b[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.41]; Wong et al. 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.85]; Hemmi & Pfeil 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.42]). Having entered a refuge, a preyorganism must make an economic decision on when to emerge (Hugie 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.45]; Martín 2014[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.59]).Boldness in emerging from shelter can vary between and among populations andindividuals (Chapter 15 [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#CN-bp-15]), and is influencedby risk assessment (Sih 1986 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.79]). Fiddlercrabs Uca mjoebergi show a correlation between “boldness” (indicated by emergingsooner) and higher aggression in other interactions, and bold and aggressivemales ultimately have higher mating success (Reaney & Backwell 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.70]). Gryllus integer cricket males vary incalling-bout lengths, and males with longer, more conspicuous songs take longerto emerge from a shelter in a novel environment than do males with shorter songs(Hedrick 2000 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.39]). Male G. bimaculatus thathave undergone a simulated predatory encounter resulting in autotomy of a hindlimb also show more caution in emerging from a shelter than do intactconspecifics (Bateman & Fleming 2014 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.9]).The spider Agelenopsis aperta retreats down the funnel of its web when disturbedby large-amplitude vibrations of the web consistent with disturbance by a birdpredator; latency to re-emergence to a foraging position on the web is greaterin sites with higher risk of predation by birds (Riechert & Hedrick 1990[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.71]).Hermit crabs carry shells of other organisms into which they can retreat.Alternatively, they can flee. Pagurus acadianus spends a longer time hiding inits shell when it has been handled by predatory lobsters (Scarratt & Godin 1992[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.76]). The type of shell used by hermit crabscan also influence economic decisions: exposure to the odor of a crushedconspecific had no effect on the choice of either of two host shells (one ofwhich was more robust than the other) in P. filholi, but the presence of apredatory crab induced a preference for the more robust host shell (Mima et al.2003 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.64]). Additionally, although hermitcrabs spent longer in the more robust shells than the more vulnerable shells,they reduced time spent in the both shells overall and resorted to fleeing froma predator stimulus in the presence of the predatory crab. Hermit crabs alsoseem to be able to assess their conspicuousness: P. bernhardus that have beeninduced to inhabit shells that are conspicuous against the substrate show muchlonger hiding times in these shells after disturbance than when in shells thatare cryptic against the substrate (Briffa & Twyman 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.12]).Although sessile organisms cannot flee, but only retreat to shelter, they willstill face the economic decision of how long to remain in the refuge beforere-emerging to feed. The polychaete worm Serpula vermicularis filter-feeds fromthe entrance of its self-constructed calcareous tube. As food in the watercolumn tends to come in “pulses” rather than uniformly, time spent hiding in thetube can be costly. Variation in latency to emerge after a predatory stimulus (amechanical shock) is, then, a relatively elaborate result of tracking short-termchanges in food availability (even changes in food availability on a relativebasis) through comparing current feeding conditions to those previouslyexperienced (Dill & Fraser 1997 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.22]).Similarly, the barnacle Balanus glandula, when induced to hide by a shadowsimulating a predator, hid longer if they had been feeding prior to hiding (Dill& Gillett 1991 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.23]).Major costs of retreating to shelter are the cost of monitoring the environmentto ensure it is safe before re-emerging (see also section 7.2.1; Chapter 9[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#CN-bp-9]) and the cost of suspending otheractivities, particularly foraging. Once an organism has descended into a burrow,it cannot effectively monitor the predator: over 70% of Uca vomeris crabsapproached tangentially by a dummy predator remain on the surface and monitorthe predator, despite having retreated toward their burrows, and only descendinto the burrow when the predatory stimulus approaches directly (Hemmi & Pfeil2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.42]).Monitoring can potentially be disrupted by other stimuli. The hermit crabCoenobita clypeatus withdraws into its shell when a black object (the “predator”stimulus) looms toward it. If the crabs are exposed to the noise of a motor boatengine at the same time, they allow the looming stimulus to approach closerbefore withdrawing, implying that the noise obscures the stimulus or “distracts”the prey and ultimately makes it more vulnerable to predation (Chan et al. 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.16]).7.3 FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE INVERTEBRATE ESCAPE RESPONSEThe EEM predicts that animals should vary their responses according to the riskpresented by the situation, balancing the benefits of moving away with the costsincurred (Chapter 2 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#CN-bp-2]). In this section, wediscuss the moderating effects of certain intrinsic and extrinsic variables onescape behavior.7.3.1 FOOD HANDLINGIn addition to the examples for sessile organisms (section 7.2.2.3[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#C-sec-20]), food handling can also influence theescape behavior of mobile invertebrates. In captivity, crayfish Procambarusclarkii that are manipulating large, immobile pieces of food have shorter FIDand are less likely to try to escape from an approaching fish net than if theyare feeding on small, portable pieces of food (Bellman & Krasne 1983[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.10]). This finding is consistent with theprediction by the EEM that FID is greater for larger food items because the costof fleeing increases as the amount of food left behind increases. Alternatively,it is possible that the net is not perceived as a “predatory stimulus,” but mayactually be inducing behavior typical for crayfish avoiding competition withconspecifics, i.e., staying to guard immobile sources of food. By comparison, ina similar situation, FID of hermit crabs Pagurus acadianus (stimulated with realand model predatory lobsters) was not influenced by mass of a food item, but thecrabs moved further away when they were carrying lighter food items (Scarratt &Godin 1992 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.76]).7.3.2 GROUP LIVINGThe drivers of group living in invertebrates may be much the same as invertebrates, including enhanced predator detection through higher cumulativevigilance via the “many-eyes” effect, dilution of predation risk, and increasedpredator defense through behaviors such as bunching (Krause & Ruxton 2002[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.51]). Group size is therefore likely toinfluence the economics of FID decisions.Juvenile water striders Gerris remigis show an increase in FID with increasinggroup size when approached by potentially cannibalistic adults, which appears tosupport the “many-eyes” hypothesis (Dill & Ydenberg 1987[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.24]). However, when the group size continuesto increase, FID decreases. Although Dill and Ydenberg (1987[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.24]) proposed that this response suggested atrade-off between fleeing and risk dilution as a factor of increased group size,predator detection might also be compromised in larger groups.As their colony increases in size, colonial-dwelling spiders Metepeiraincrassata have a reduced chance of falling victim to predatory wasps thatattack a series of spiders in each raid, mainly through an “early-warning”effect due to web vibrations caused by the wasps (Uetz et al. 2002[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.83]). The likelihood of spiders droppingfrom the nest increased later in the attack run of the wasps’ raid.Consequently, adult female spiders at the center of the nest had longer FID thandid those on the edge of the nest due to this “early warning.” Interestingly,immature spiders (which are less preferred prey for the wasps) showed nodifference in FID among positions in the colony.Ocean skaters Halobates robustus approached by a predatory stimulus swiftlytransmit avoidance behavior (speeding up and increasing frequency of turns)through their groups. This transmission is faster even than the speed of theapproaching stimulus (Treherne & Foster 1981[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.82]).7.3.3 EFFECTS OF BODY SIZE AND AGE ON ESCAPE BEHAVIORBody size of prey in relation to the predator may influence escape responses fortwo reasons. Firstly, larger individuals may more effectively protect themselvesby using other defenses (e.g., kicking, biting, struggling, faster running;Bateman & Fleming 2008 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.5]). Secondly,performance traits may be related to size: e.g., jumping spiders Servaea incanacan run and climb faster as body size increases, but endurance decreases,suggesting an evolutionary trade-off (McGinley et al. 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.60]). Additionally, changes in body size mayinfluence more fundamental features, such as the suite of predators a preyspecies faces.Consequently, we should predict ontogenetic differences in escape behavior.Following a puff of air (intended to simulate a predatory spider), juvenile woodcrickets Nemobius sylvestris are more likely to jump than are adults, andjuveniles also flee proportionally farther (Arai et al. 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.1]). Mayfly larvae Baetis tricaudatus thathave detected predatory fish or stonefly larvae reduce their foraging activityand increase the likelihood of drifting out of dangerous patches (Scrimgeour &Culp 1994 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.77]); the likelihood of drift inthe presence of the dace was, however, reduced in large larvae, which couldreflect higher risk assessment by smaller individuals (Scrimgeour et al. 1994[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.78]). Smaller barnacles Balanus glandulahide longer than larger ones after a disturbance (Dill & Gillett 1991[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.23]), possibly reflecting higher risk forsmaller individuals.7.3.4 EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE ON ESCAPE BEHAVIORTemperature influences all biochemical processes and therefore fundamentallyinfluences the physiological responses of ectotherms. Rates of processes risewith increasing temperature before stabilizing and then falling as temperaturesincrease beyond thermal tolerance limits (Hochachka & Somero 2002[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.43]). The contractile frequency and poweroutput of muscle tissues depend greatly on temperature: the minimum flighttemperature for the thoracic muscles of locusts to generate enough power forsustained flight is ~20°C (Chappell & Whitman 1990[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.17] and references therein). Under highertemperatures, tonic immobility in water scorpions Ranatra sp. is reduced (Holmes1906 [OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.44]). Scallops escape by jet propulsionof water through a valve and the clapping of the bivalve shell by the muscularmantle; higher temperatures generally result in higher valve contraction, andmuscle contractile properties also increase (Guderley & Tremblay 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.35]). Indeed, the scallop Argopectencolbecki cannot swim at all at 2°C (Peck et al. 2004[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.68]).Crustaceans actively avoid and exit temperature zones that approach theirtolerance limits and, when in the middle of their optimum range, they showreduced movement, which ensures remaining in the zone (Lagerspetz & Vainio 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.52]). Outside this zone, many species ofcrustacean show reduced ability to carry out reproductive behavior, performphototactic behavior, right themselves, or show efficient escape reflexes; insome cases they even have reduced walking ability (see Lagerspetz & Vainio 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.52] for a review). Barnacles withdraw theircirrae when the predatory stimulus of a shadow falls across them and thisresponse is temperature dependent, occurring faster in the center of the optimumtemperature range (Lagerspetz & Kivivuori 1970[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.53]).7.4 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCHAlthough there is a growing body of research that explores the economicdecisions of escape behavior with invertebrate models, there are still many taxathat have not been examined. Each taxon promises its own unique insight into thecosts and benefits of escape behavior according to the particular set ofcircumstances it faces. In particular, the different modes of communication(visual, acoustic, tactile, and chemical) are each likely to have differentinfluences on antipredation behavior.Despite the fact that one of the first empirical papers to explore thepredictions of the EEM was on water striders (Dill & Ydenberg 1987[OEBPS_Text_part0018.xhtml#REFe-r-7.24]), invertebrates are underrepresented inthe literature since then. Given their great diversity, we encourage moreresearchers to consider invertebrates as model taxa for studies of escapebehavior; they can be very useful for such studies, particularly considering theease of manipulating them, the effects of autotomy and ontogenetic stages, andthe ease of obtaining large sample sizes.REFERENCESArai, T., Tominaga, O., Seikai, T. & Masuda, R.

Ruxton8.1 INTRODUCTIONAfter a prey individual has made the decision to flee from an approachingpredator, a range of important behavioral options remain open to it, which canstrongly influence the likelihood of flight being successful. We will exploresome of these and consider signaling to the chasing predator (and to others)during flight and other ways prey may exploit the predator’s sensory systems.The most obvious way in which prey behavior during flight can influence escapeability is through control of the trajectory of its escape path. We willtherefore focus the bulk of the chapter on this issue, not only because it isimportant, but also because there are many factors that may influence escapetrajectory. However, flight logically begins with the initial directionaldecision. At first sight it seems obvious that prey should turn and flee awayfrom the oncoming predator, but even this is not as simple as it first seems. Todiscuss this decision most effectively, we first introduce the reader to theconcept of directionality in the early phase of an escape response (i.e., thefirst detectable reaction to a threat).We focus only on certain aspects of behavior during predation attempts in somedepth rather than covering all aspects briefly. We have not necessarily chosenthe behaviors that might have the strongest influence on the outcome of flight.Rather we have chosen topics where we feel we can offer a fresh perspective onhow extensive research in the field could further develop. We will begin bynoting a number of topics that we do not explore in detail in this chapter.An important aspect of fleeing behavior is the decision to stop (or at leastpause) fleeing. This may occur if the prey perceives that the predator has givenup the chase. The factors influencing the decision of when to stop fleeing havebeen understudied for practical reasons. It is difficult for experimenters tokeep track of a fleeing animal, and so we have much more data on flightinitiation than flight termination. This imbalance is likely to be corrected inthe near future thanks to technological breakthroughs that allow the mounting oftelemetric equipment on free-living animals.One might assume that prey should flee at the highest possible speed, but thismight not be the case. Slower speeds during flight may generate compensatorybenefits of increased ability to monitor the chasing predator, and/or increasedability to sustain flight; it may also be related to a lower perceived risk ofpredation (Domenici 2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.24]). The role oflocomotor performance on the escape ability of the prey is the subject ofChapter 11 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_000.xhtml#CN-bp-11] of this book, but wewill briefly discuss the relative importance of speed and maneuverability, andthe possibility that prey speed may be a cue that could be used by predators toassess prey palatability. Obtaining accurate speed measurements in the fieldfrom animals fleeing on trajectories that are often unpredictable and complexhas been challenging; and again we expect that innovations in on-animaltelemetry, GPS tracking, and accelerometry will revolutionize our understandingof this issue in the near future (Wilson et al. 2013).We have not attempted to link the behavior of fleeing to life history andphysiology. It is likely that flight decisions will be affected by long-termfactors (e.g., ontogeny), medium-term factors (e.g., whether the animal iscarrying young or not, the health status of the individual) and short-termfactors (e.g., how recently the individual has previously fled, the localtopography, the animal’s familiarity with the local topography). We will mentionthese topics briefly.Finally, we have not sought to be encyclopedic in our taxonomic coverage. Ratherwe focus on small invertebrates, where experimental control and replication aremore practical and ethical, and lower vertebrates, which have been studiedextensively. Hence this chapter does not attempt to discuss taxonomicdistributions of different behaviors; data to attempt this usefully are not yetavailable.8.2 DIRECTIONALITY OF INITIAL ESCAPE RESPONSES8.2.1 THE MEANING OF DIRECTIONALITYWhen startled, animals tend to change their direction, most often in a way thattakes them further away from the threat. The proportion of replicates in which aprey rotates or bends (for flexible animals) its body in a direction away fromthe threatening stimulus during the initial phase of an escape response iscalled directionality (Blaxter & Batty 1987[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.6]; Comer & Dowd 1987[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.16]; Domenici & Blake 1993a[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.26]; Domenici et al. 2011a[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.31]).Thus, away and toward responses correspond to escapes accomplished via aninitial turn directed away from and toward the stimulus, respectively. It isimportant to note that toward and away responses do not necessarily imply thatthe final heading of the prey will be toward or away from the threat,respectively. If the escape turn in a toward response is relatively small (e.g.,10°), the prey may continue to move along a path that is in a semicircle awayfrom the threat (Figure 8.1 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#FIGm-fig-52]).[OEBPS_Images_image00947.jpeg]Figure 8.1A small turn toward the threat (represented by the arrow at 0°) may result in afinal heading (dark colored fish) in the semicircle away (A) or toward thestimulus (B), depending on the prey’s initial orientation (light colored fish).Similarly, a small turn away from the threat may result in a final heading inthe semicircle away (C) or toward (D) the threat.Independent of the final heading, scoring escapes in terms of initial responsesaway or toward provides us with a tool to investigate some of the underlyingcomplexity of escape responses. Unpredictability has been suggested as anessential element of escape responses (Humphries & Driver 1970[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.46]; Godin 1997[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.37]; Edut & Eilam 2004[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.36]; Comer 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.17]). In terms of directionality, for mostpredator approach trajectories, a random and therefore fully unpredictablepattern of escape would yield an equal proportion of away and toward responses.Alternatively, away responses may be advantageous because they allow prey toincrease their distance from the threat. Most previous work (reviewed inDomenici et al. 2011a [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.31]) showsdirectionality that is not completely random (i.e., 50% away and 50% toward),nor is it fully determined by the position of the threat (i.e., 100% away). Awayresponses tend to be more common than toward responses, and they constituteabout 50 to 90% of the total escapes. From a sensory perspective, this isbecause the sensory system ipsilateral to the threat causes a rotation in adirection opposite to the stimulation (Domenici et al. 2011a[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.31]). In fish, the Mauthner cells (i.e., thegiant neurons that control escape responses) ipsilateral to the threateningstimulus are activated and control the contraction of the contralateral muscle,resulting in an away response in most cases (Eaton et al. 1981[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.35]).Although the presence of a small proportion of toward responses may be explainedas a behavioral survival strategy, it may also be related to constraintsaffecting sensory performance, and these explanations need not be mutuallyexclusive. While away responses allow prey to move farther away from the threat,a small context-dependent proportion of toward responses may introduce asignificant element of unpredictability. As we shall see, directionality ishighly context dependent and is affected by a number of factors. Understandinghow directionality is affected by environmental factors as well as by trade-offswith other characteristics of the escape response is fundamental to gaining someinsights into the mechanisms driving directionality.8.2.2 INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AFFECTINGDIRECTIONALITYAccuracy is known to trade-off with the speed of a given behavioral response(Chittka et al. 2009 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.15]). This generalprinciple applies to work carried out on escape response, which shows that awayresponses have longer latencies than toward responses (in fish: Domenici & Batty1997 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.25]; Turesson et al. 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.76]). This suggests a potential trade-offbetween a short neural processing time (i.e., short latencies) and accuracy indirecting the response away from the threat.The orientation of the stimulus relative to the prey has an effect ondirectionality. In fish, when the threat comes from a direction that isapproximately perpendicular to the prey’s body axis, escapes are most often awayresponses. On the other hand, when the stimulation is approximately in line withthe prey’s body axis (i.e., within 30° from head-on or tail-on), escapes areequally likely to be away or toward responses (Domenici & Blake 1993a[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.26]). From a sensory perspective, this islikely due to a decrease in left–right discrimination for mechanical stimulithat are aligned with the longitudinal axis of the fish (Domenici & Blake 1993a[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.26]). However, according to a non-mutuallyexclusive functional explanation, when the prey is in line with the threat,executing a toward or an away response may matter very little in terms ofdistance gained from the predator and a similar proportion of away and towardresponses may add unpredictability (Domenici 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.24]).In many animal species, individuals may show task-specific lateral biases(Vallortigara & Rogers 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.77]).Lateralization has also been observed in escape responses, and it has beenattributed to functional asymmetries in the brain (Cantalupo et al. 1995[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.11]) or in the body/limbs (Heuts 1999[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.43], Krylov et al. 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.56]). Specialization for turning left orright may offset the disadvantages of turning toward the threat, and this maycontribute to explaining why directionality is less than 100% in most species.A predatory attack does not always trigger all sensory systems simultaneously,and different sensory channels do not necessarily yield similar levels ofdirectionality. In a fish (herring larvae Clupea harengus), visual stimuli areassociated with the highest directionality, compared with tactile and auditorystimuli (Blaxter & Batty 1985 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.5]; Yin &Blaxter 1987 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.86]; Batty 1989[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.4]). Furthermore, directionality mayincrease across ontogenetic stages as a result of the development of sensoryorgans (Blaxter & Batty 1985 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.5]).Immediately prior to being startled, prey can be relatively idle or activelymoving, and this can have an effect on directionality. For example, fish in thegliding phase of some swimming patterns show a higher proportion of awayresponses than actively swimming fish (Blaxter & Batty 1987[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.6]). The physical environment can alsoaffect directionality. Acute exposure to low temperature, low oxygen levels, andhigh CO2 were found to decrease directionality in fish (Preuss & Faber 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.65]; Domenici et al. 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.28]; Allan et al. 2014[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.1]). These acute environmental changes arelikely to have a direct effect on the functioning of the sensorimotor system,suggesting that directionality can be constrained by sensory performance.Any object or organism positioned near the prey can also affect the proportionof away responses. Fish show an increased proportion of toward response when thepath directed away from the threat is obstructed by a wall (Eaton & Emberley1991 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.34]). Anurans not only avoid escapingtoward a barrier, but they also avoid escaping directly away from the threat ifthis means moving in the direction in which a barrier had been previouslypositioned and then removed (Ingle & Hoff 1990[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.47]).The presence of conspecifics can affect directionality in fish. Herring startledwhile solitary show lower directionality (around 65%) than those in a school(around 90%; Domenici & Batty 1997 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.25]).This response may reflect a need for schooling fish to stick together, andtherefore to show a uniform away response, as opposed to solitary fish thatmight increase the unpredictability of their response by turning toward thethreat. Another proximate explanation may be that escape latencies are longer inschooling than solitary fish, which may allow them more time for sensoryprocessing and therefore for directional accuracy, which agrees with thespeed–accuracy trade-off.8.2.3 SHOULD RESPONSES WITH A TURN TOWARD A PREDATOR BE CONSIDERED MISTAKES?Work described above suggests that the directionality of escape responses ishighly flexible. Early work on escape responses in fish and insects consideredtoward responses as potentially “incorrect,” “wrong,” or “apparent tacticalerrors” (e.g., Eaton & Emberley 1991 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.34];Tauber & Camhi 1995 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.74]; King & Comer 1996[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.53]). To assess the functional significanceof toward responses, we need to assess the effect of directionality on escapesuccess. This has rarely been done, and therefore a possible way to assess theimportance of directionality is through its effect on the final escapetrajectory, which is known to be a major determinant of escape success (Walkeret al. 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.81]).Can prey whose initial escape is a turn toward the predator quickly steer toproduce a trajectory directed away from the threat? In schooling herring, suchsteering is possible, because initial escaping with away and toward responsesproduce similar final escape trajectories at around 150° away from the threat(Domenici & Batty 1997 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.25]). In contrast, insolitary herring the escape trajectories of toward and away responses differ.Schooling herring surrounded by neighbors that, in most cases, are swimming awayfrom the threat, may conform by swimming in the same direction. The need toremain in contact with the group may be stronger than the need for generatingunpredictability in the response (Domenici & Batty 1997[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.25]).In cockroaches (Periplaneta americana), initial toward responses tend to showvery small turn angles (<30°) and the final escape trajectories largely overlapwith those of away responses. When making a toward response, cockroaches maytherefore be minimizing the time needed for the turn, which allows them toquickly reach one of the preferred escape trajectories, in turn allowing them toproduce an effective antipredator response (Domenici et al. 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.30]). Frogs (Rana pipiens) show a similarpattern in escape behavior with toward responses producing small turn angles andescape trajectories that overlap with those of away responses (Domenici et al.2011b [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.32]).In addition to representing a mechanism that minimizes the time needed forreaching specific trajectories and for generating unpredictability, towardresponses may, in some predator–prey interactions, show a higher probability ofsuccess in avoiding capture. Predator attacks may in some cases reflectrelatively complex strategies, so that escaping in what may appear the mostsensible direction (away from the threat) may not pay off. A good example isthat of tentacle snakes (Erpeton tentaculatum) feeding on fish. Tentacle snakesuse their body to produce a pressure wave directed toward one side of the fish’sbody, which triggers an away response in their prey in 80% of the trials(Catania 2009 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.13]). In encounters withcommon predators, away responses would most likely direct the fish away fromdanger. However, tentacle snakes position their mouths where the fishpredictably ends up when producing a response away from the snake’s body wave.As a result, fish escaping with an away response end up moving toward thesnake’s open mouth (Figure 8.2 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#FIGm-fig-53]).Tentacle snakes are rare predators of fish and this is most likely why they canturn the typically high proportion of away responses in fish to their advantage.From the prey’s perspective, a small proportion of toward responses may beadaptive in preventing capture by rare predators. It would be interesting toinvestigate if the occurrence of toward responses varies depending on theabundance of such rare predators.[OEBPS_Images_image00948.jpeg]Figure 8.2Fish escape response to tentacled snakes. The pressure wave created by thesnake’s body is shown in the left panels by the arrow marked as “3.” The preyreacts with an “away response” (i.e., the body makes a C-shape away from thesnake’s body; central panels), and eventually ends up in the snake’s mouth(right panels).(Reprinted from PNAS, Figures 3A, B in Catania, 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.13] with permission from the author andpublisher)In conclusion, toward responses may not necessarily represent mistakes such asthose derived from a misjudged assessment of the direction of the danger. Atleast in some cases, toward responses may be time-minimization strategies, maygenerate unpredictability, and may be adaptive responses to the attacks of rarepredators. On the other hand, the low directionality caused by acute exposure totemperature, hypoxia, and elevated CO2, is most likely the result ofmalfunctioning of the sensory-motor system, which may lead to a suboptimalproportion of away responses. Furthermore, as we shall see in the section onescape trajectories below, escaping toward the predator in some cases (e.g.,some larval fish, lizards, and small mammals attacked by birds) may represent astrategy to surprise and flee past the predator and reach safety before thepredator can turn and pursue effectively (Domenici et al. 2011b[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.32]).8.3 ESCAPE TRAJECTORIES8.3.1 METHODOLOGICAL ISSUESAfter the initial response, animals escape along a trajectory that can beevaluated using successive positions (Domenici & Blake 1993a[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.26]), or by simply analyzing the heading ofthe body axis at a particular point in time, typically after the main initialrotational motion of the prey (Eaton & Emberley 1991[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.34]). Many studies have focused on this“initial” trajectory of the escape response although some prey may undergo aseries of zigzagging turns in subsequent stages of the escape (Humphries &Driver 1970 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.46]). While directionality isbased on the relative change in direction with respect to the threat (i.e., aturn may be toward or away from the threat; Figure 8.1[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#FIGm-fig-52]), escape trajectories do not take intoaccount the motion the prey has accomplished to achieve a given angle betweenits own heading and the position of the threat.A number of analytical approaches have been used to study the angle of theescape trajectory in prey. Early work was based on linear statistics of turnangle (y-axis) as a function of stimulus angle (x-axis) (Camhi & Tom 1978[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.10]; Eaton et al. 1981[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.35]; Stern et al. 1997[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.72]) (Figure 8.3A[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#FIGm-fig-54]). This type of analysis allows one totest how the turn angle (i.e., the angle of turn measured relative to the prey’sbody axis) varies with respect to the angle at which the prey is attacked. Usingthis type of analysis, attack angles range from 0° (i.e., tail on) to 180° (headon). Conventionally, attacks from and responses to the right are plotted aspositive values, while attacks from and responses to the left are plotted asnegative values. Because prey tend to escape in a direction approximately awayfrom the threat, this type of analysis tends to yield a general decrease fromthe “−x + y” sector to the “+x –y” sector, which can be tested using linearregression. However, because most points are located in two Cartesian sectors(−x and y; x and −y) out of the four, significance may result even if, withineach sector, turn angle is not related to attack angle. This problem can beovercome by testing each sector separately, or by pooling left and right stimuliin a single graph, i.e., using an axial rather than a circular scale (Eaton &Emberley 1991 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.34]).[OEBPS_Images_image00949.jpeg]Figure 8.3(A) Linear (cartesian) representation of turn angle (y-axis) and stimulus angle(x-axis). By convention, stimuli from and responses to the right are plotted aspositive values whereas stimuli from and responses to the left are plotted asnegative values (cockroach Periplaneta americana, data set 5i; N = 431;unpublished figure based on data from Domenici et al., 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.29]). Inset: circular representation of thedata using the convention shown in (B). In the inset, responses are plotted asif the stimulus corresponding to 0° is always coming from the right of theanimal. Concentric circles represent a frequency of ten. Bin frequency is five.(B) Definitions of escape trajectory angles in toward (left panel) and away(central panel) responses. Toward and away responses are escapes in which theturn angle achieved during the initial rotation is directed toward or away fromthe stimulus, respectively. In this example from the cockroach, the anglesubtended by the arc labeled “wind” is the stimulus angle, that by the arclabeled “turn” is the turn angle and that by the thick arc is the final escapetrajectory (ET). Away and toward responses may have the same ET (shown in theright panel).Figure 8.3A [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#FIGm-fig-54]: reprinted from Journal ofExperimental Biology, Figure 1A in Domenici et al. (2011b[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.32]) with permission from the publisher;inset: reprinted from Current Biology, Figure 2A in Domenici et al. (2008[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.29]) with permission from Elsevier; Figure8.3B [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#FIGm-fig-54]: based on Figure 5 in Booth et al.(1999 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.8]) reproduced with permission of theJournal of Neuroscience.While this approach may be useful in testing how animals adjust their turn anglerelative to the stimulus, it has some drawbacks: (a) the use of a linearregression is appropriate only if, for any value of x, the y values are normallydistributed, which is not necessarily the case for escape responses (Domenici etal. 2008 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.29]); and (b) the hypothesis thatanimals respond using one or more specific headings relative to the threatcannot be tested using linear regression of turn angle vs. attack angles.To assess the direction of the escape trajectories (ET) relative to the predatorattack direction in angelfish, Domenici and Blake (1993a[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.26]) used circular statistics in which ET isdefined as the angle between the threat (positioned at 0°) and the escape pathof the prey once the body rotation is completed (Domenici et al. 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.29]) or at a specific kinematic stage, suchas the second axial bend in the fish escape response (Domenici & Blake 1993a[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.26]). This analytical approach has been usedon other species (e.g., crayfish Crangon crangon, Arnott et al. 1999[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.2]; cockroaches Periplaneta americana,Domenici et al. 2008 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.29]; lizardsPsammodromus algirus, Martín & López 1996[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.61]). Escape trajectories can be calculatedas the sum of attack angle (here ranging from 0° in head-on attacks to 180° intail-on attacks) and turn angle, where toward and away responses bear a negativeand a positive sign, respectively (Figure 8.3B[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#FIGm-fig-54]).Using this method, ET can span 360° and is treated as a circular variable(Batschelet 1981 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.3]; Domenici et al. 2011b[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.32]; Pewsey et al. 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.64]). Escape trajectories in which theposition of the attack remains on the same side of the prey as at the beginningof the escape response will be placed in the 0 to 180° semicircle. Conversely,if the attack ends up on the opposite side, ETs are placed in the semicircle180° to 360°. Unless specific asymmetries occur, by convention, right and leftescapes can be pooled as if all stimuli are on the right (Domenici & Blake 1993a[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.26]). This type of analysis allows thepattern of the escape heading of the prey relative to the attack direction to beassessed. Some previous work has used slightly different ways of measuring ETs(discussed in Domenici et al. 2011b [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.32])although in most cases these other conventions yield the same values as the ET.8.3.2 THEORY AND PRACTICE: IN WHICH DIRECTION DO ANIMALS FLEE?Geometric arguments (see Case A, below) suggest that there is an optimaltrajectory that maximizes the chances of survival. However, this approach yieldsa single solution in terms of ET, and therefore does not deal withunpredictability that prevents the predator taking countermeasures. Furthermore,as we shall see, many other factors can affect ET, such as the position of thesensory organs on the prey, the subsequent ET that allows prey to track thepredator, as well as the presence of refugia. Given all these considerations, anumber of potential theoretical distributions can be derived (Figure 8.4[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#FIGm-fig-55]), most of which are used by some preyspecies studied in the past.[OEBPS_Images_image00950.jpeg]Figure 8.4Various theoretical distributions of escape trajectories.

According to these models, ETs range over 90 to 180°. Whilemost previous work on escape responses show this range of trajectories (Domeniciet al. 2011b [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.32]), we are not aware of anystudy that has directly tested the relationship between the relative speeds ofpredator and prey and ETs, although birds, for example, are known to usedifferent ETs depending on the approach speed of the predator (Domenici et al.2011b [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.32]). Furthermore, prey are able toproduce a “compromise” ET when attacked by predators from two differentdirections (Cooper et al. 2007 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.19]). Inaddition to the idea of maximizing distance from the threat, some previous workhas considered the need prey can have to track the predator while escaping. Forexample, whiting (Marlangius merlangus) escape at 135° and this was suggested tomaximize distance from the threat while keeping the predator within the visualfield (Hall et al. 1986 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.38]).Visual tracking while escaping has also been found in a number of arthropods.The haematophagous bug (Triatoma infestans) orients itself at an angle of about120° relative to an approaching object (Lazzari & Varju 1990[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.59]; Figure 8.5A[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#FIGm-fig-56]). Because its visual field is about140°, Lazzari and Varju (1990 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.59]) suggestthat keeping the threat at 120° gives the prey a safety factor of a few degrees,which prevents the predator from entering the blind zone as a result of smallvariations in relative motions. Nevertheless, the resulting distribution ofobserved ETs is quite large, spanning approximately 90°, from 70° to 160°(Lazzari & Varju 1990 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.59]). In someside-walking species of crabs, escaping at approximately 180° allows tracking ofthe predator as a result of a combination of a translatory motion away from thethreat (at 180°) and a rotation mechanism that allows the crab to keep thethreat at 90° from the body axis (Layne & Land 1995[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.57]; Oliva et al. 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.62]). Planktonic prey showed an escaperesponse at 90° from the flow field of the predator, maximizing distance awayfrom it (Jakobsen 2002 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.50]). All of theseexamples yield a single optimal trajectory, although data show some degree ofvariability (Lazzari & Varju 1990 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.59]). Itwould be interesting to test whether this variability is simply the result ofnoise in the system (i.e., measurement errors, limits in the animal’s accuracy),or whether it has a function in increasing the unpredictability of the response.[OEBPS_Images_image00951.jpeg]Figure 8.5Examples of various escape strategies. (A) Triatoma infestans escapes using asingle trajectory (about 120°) away from the stimulus, which allows tracking thethreat. (B) Cockroaches (Periplaneta americana) escape using multimodal escapetrajectories away from the threat (represented by the dashed line), thusproducing unpredictability in their escape (C) Lizards (Uta stansburiana) escapein the direction of the refuge.

However, at least in some predator–prey systems, repeating thesame strategy over and over would make the prey’s response predictable, allowinglearning, or even natural selection of countermeasures by predators. Asalternatives to a single optimal trajectory, prey could escape using random ETswithin a limited angular sector or use random selections from a finite range ofpreferred ETs. The limits in the angular sector exclude the use of trajectoriestoward the predator, while keeping enough variability to restrict predatorcountermeasures. These two strategies are discussed here together, because (a)they are likely to yield similar results in terms of prey escape success,although the neural basis of the escape behavior may differ between the twostrategies, and (b) they are difficult to distinguish experimentally unlesslarge sample sizes are used.The different outcome, in terms of probability to escape, when using a single,optimal trajectory, vs. multiple trajectories within a given sector, isillustrated in Figure 8.6 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#FIGm-fig-57]. For the“first” encounter (i.e., between a naïve predator and a naïve prey), the escapeprobability is higher (the length of the escape vector in Figure 8.6A[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#FIGm-fig-57]) when using the optimal ET. However,when considering successive events, the probability of escape success decreaseswhen using the “optimal ET” strategy (Figure 8.6B[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#FIGm-fig-57]), because of predator countermeasures topredictable prey ETs. On the other hand, the use of variable ETs (Figure 8.6C[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#FIGm-fig-57]) prevents this decrease in escapeprobability. As a result, although for each single predator–prey encounter, preyescape probability is lower than when using an optimal ET with a naïve predator,the mean of the escape probability calculated across all events is higher in the“high variability” than in the “optimal ET” strategy.[OEBPS_Images_image00952.jpeg]Figure 8.6Diagram showing the theoretical effect of multiple attacks spread over time(predator positioned at 0°, grey arrow) and ETs on escape probability(represented by the length of the escape vector).(A) An ET with maximum escapeprobability (dotted arrow) with other ETs (full arrows) with lower probabilitiesof escape as a function of their angular distance from the optimal ET. (B) TheET with the highest escape probability is used in all four successive responses.Escape probability decreases as a result of predators learning to anticipatewhich ET will be used in successive responses. (C) Different ETs (both optimaland suboptimal) are taken in four successive responses. The escape probabilitydoes not decrease with successive responses because predators cannot learn whichET will be taken.(Reprinted from Journal of Experimental Biology, Figure 3 in Domenici et al.(2011a [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.31]), with permission from thepublisher)Escaping using variable or multiple trajectories appears to be a common strategyin many prey species from different taxa (Domenici et al. 2011b[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.32]). In most cases, ETs tend to be withinthe 90 to 180° sector because prey tend to keep the threat on the side of theinitial stimulation, rather than overturning (i.e., ETs in a semicircle 180 to360° are rare) (Domenici et al. 2011b [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.32]).A number of prey species (including fish, frogs, plankton, and deer; reviewed inDomenici et al. 2011b [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.32]) show two maintrajectories, typically at 180° and at approximately 90 to 130°. These have beenobserved in various species of fish, and were suggested to correspond tomaximizing distance from the threat (180°) and keeping it within an angularfield that allows tracking of the predator (130°) (Domenici & Blake 1993a[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.26]; Domenici & Batty 1997[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.25]).Unlike side-walking crabs, soldier crabs (Mictyris longicarpus) walk forward,and therefore do not have the option of escaping away from a predator whilemaintaining visual contact. Soldier crabs show two main ETs (150° and 210°)which are symmetric with respect to 180°, and may serve to track the threatwithin the limits of the visual field (Domenici & Blake 1993a[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.26]).Some species of birds use different trajectories depending of the approach speedof the predator, with high and low predator speeds triggering escape responsedirected at 90° and 180°, respectively. This behavior is in line with theprediction of the models based on attack speeds, although only the extremetrajectories were observed. Other animals, including some larval fish, lizards,and small mammals attacked by birds, may escape using alternative directions;either away or toward the threat, where the latter may represent a strategy tosurprise and flee past the predator before it can adjust its trajectory(Domenici et al. 2011b [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.32]).Some insect species appear to escape using more than two characteristicdirections. This pattern has been fully demonstrated in cockroaches, both at thepopulation and at the individual level (Figure 8.5B[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#FIGm-fig-56]; Domenici et al. 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.29]). Each single cockroach escaped eitherat 90°, 120°, 150°, or 180° away from the threat. Although other insect speciesshow highly variable ETs, whether this pattern is due to multiple peaks orrandom noise awaits further work using large sample sizes. Partitioning the twostrategies (random noise vs. multiple peaks) will be particularly useful forelucidating the underlying mechanism generating escape variability although bothtactics may allow prey to generate the unpredictability necessary to preventpredator countermeasures.8.3.2.3 CASE D: RANDOM TRAJECTORIES SPANNING 360° RELATIVE TO THE THREAT (FIGURE8.4D [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#FIGm-fig-55])This strategy represents the ultimate unpredictability. Importantly, it includessituations where prey would move directly toward the predator. This creates aquestion: is the potential cost of occasionally going toward the predatoroutweighed by the extreme unpredictability? Given that responses toward thepredator are rare, it appears that other strategies generating variabilitywithout including a response toward the threat are more common (e.g., Cases Band C). There are, however, a couple of specific cases that may, at leastpotentially, generate random trajectories when measured relative to the threat.Springtails (collembolans Heteromurus nitidus) and the common house mosquito(Culex pipiens) pupae escape in a fixed direction relative to their body axis(von Christian 1978 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.82]; Brackenbury 1999[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.9]), which should result in random ETsmeasured relative to the threat. This strategy should result in highlyunpredictable directions of escape, unless the predator can forecast ETs basedon the body orientation of the prey before the attack.Another example that could, at least theoretically, yield random trajectories,is based on “nonsense orientation” exhibited by some species of birds (Thake1981 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.73]; Hart et al. 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.40]). These birds (e.g., mallards Anasplatyrhynchos) appear to fly along a common preferred direction upon release,which does not appear to be related to the migration or homing direction. Hartet al. (2013 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.40]) suggest that this commondirection (fixed relative to cardinal points) may facilitate flock formation inan escape context. The advantage of such strategy would be that individuals of aflock will minimize decision time and will not disperse the flock. This strategywould theoretically result in random ETs when measured relative to the threat,unless the threat itself comes from a preferred geographical direction, as isthe case of some predators (Červený et al. 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.14]).8.3.2.4 CASE E: ETS TOWARD A REFUGE (FIGURE 8.4E[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#FIGm-fig-55])Although more work is needed to test the effect of refuges in laboratory andfield conditions, it is clear that the ETs of species living in a complexenvironment where shelters and burrows are available may be affected by suchstructures. This is certainly the case of many species of lizards and smallmammals (see Chapters 3 [OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#CN-bp-3] and 5[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#CN-bp-5]). A refuge may lead to ultimate protectionfrom predators, and therefore, direction to the refuge may even override theimportance of the direction of approach of a threat. The relative importance ofthe position of the predator and that of the refuge may depend on their distancefrom the prey, and in fact the effect of refuges decreases with increasingdistance from the prey (e.g., in lizards Leiocephalus carinatus, Cooper 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.18]; Uta stansburiana, Zani et al. 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.87]; Figure 8.5C[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#FIGm-fig-56]).8.3.2.5 CASE F: INTERMEDIATE STRATEGY: AWAY FROM THE THREAT AND TOWARD A REFUGE(FIGURE 8.4F [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#FIGm-fig-55])In some cases, prey may be affected by both predator and refuge position, andthe resulting ET may reflect a compromise between moving away from the threatand approaching the refuge. This is the case for blue crabs (Callinestessapidus), which have an escape trajectory approximately midway betweenmaximizing distance from the predator and reaching cover in the shortest time(Woodbury 1986 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.85]; Figure 8.5D[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#FIGm-fig-56]).8.3.2.6 OVERALL TRENDSPrevious work discussed above suggests that there is no single optimal ET.Rather, the ETs used by the prey will largely depend on the environmentalcontext, the design of the prey’s sensory system, and prey maneuverability. Themost common escape strategies are (1) high ET variability, which may be due tomultiple peaks or to wide ET distributions; (2) ETs that allow prey tocontinually track the threat; and (3) ETs directed toward a refuge. While highET variability provides high unpredictability, tracking the threat and fleeingtoward a refuge are relatively predictable in terms of direction.The specific strategy used by the prey may be taxon and context specific: it maydepend on the type of attack and the structural complexity of the habitat.Clearly, in some contexts, the need for unpredictability is overridden by theneed to track the predator or to reach a refuge. Predator tracking may be moreimportant in relatively slow and distant interactions, in which the prey cancompensate for the motion of the predator. Similarly, reaching a refuge may bemore beneficial than escaping in unpredictable directions when the refuge isnearby.8.3.3 THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF SPEED AND MANEUVERABILITY IN PREDATORS CHASINGPREYWork on predator–prey interactions in fish shows that both prey speed and ET aredeterminants of the prey’s escape success (Walker et al. 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.81]). However, in cases in which escapespeed is traded off with reaching a trajectory away from the threat requiring alarge turning angle, fish were shown to escape at submaximal speeds in thedirection of the preferred trajectories (ranging from 130 to 180° away from thethreat) (Domenici & Blake 1993a [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.26],b[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.27]). Predators are usually larger thantheir prey, and therefore in most cases they are also faster because speed tendsto increase with body size in many taxa (Peters 1983[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.63]). Therefore if predator–prey gambitswere to occur in a straight line, predators would generally be able to catch upwith their prey. However, small animals tend to be more maneuverable than largeones, having smaller turning radii and higher turning rates (Howland 1974[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.44]; Domenici 2001[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.21]). From this perspective, frequentturning, such as the zigzagging, displayed by many prey when chased, may allowprey to gain ground on predators, in addition to increasing the unpredictabilityof their escape path.Furthermore, it has generally been assumed that this so-called protean behaviorbenefits the prey. This benefit may remove the advantage the predator would havein “cutting corners” in its pursuit trajectory so as to close on its prey.Alternatively (or additionally) it may induce the predator to move more slowlyso as to retain an ability to respond to changes in direction more quickly, orit may reduce the ability of the predator to quickly make good responses simplybecause more cognitive attention is required for tracking zigzagging prey. Anyof these mechanisms might increase the time that the predator requires tocapture the prey (thus making the prey less attractive) and/or increase thechance of the chase being unsuccessful from the predator’s viewpoint. It isfurther assumed that the essence of the behavior is unpredictability (Humphries& Driver 1967 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.45]; 1970[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.46]), and it is this unpredictability in thefuture trajectory that makes capture more difficult for predators.The term “protean behavior” was introduced by Humphries and Driver (1967[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.45]), and very carefully explored in asubsequent highly influential monograph (Driver & Humphries 1988[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.33]). While that book provides descriptionsof a wealth of observational studies, the most explicit experimental test of theidea is much more recent (Jones et al. 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.52]). Jones et al. (2011[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.52]) tasked human volunteers to “capture”tadpole-like representations of prey that swam around a computer screen. Captureinvolved moving a cursor over the prey by means of the computer’s mouse. Theprey’s movements were varied according to a programmed algorithm. Allindividuals had a fixed probability per unit time of initiating a change indirection. For “control” individuals the turn angle selected was chosen randomlyfrom within relatively narrow bounds, such that the long-term trajectory of theprey was relatively smooth; whereas “protean” individuals selected their turnangles from a much wider distribution and so had trajectories that includedoccasional abrupt turns. The human subjects found the “protean” preysubstantially more difficult to capture. In this case, the prey moving along anunpredictable path benefitted from lower capture success. There are, however,other potential ways a prey could benefit from protean behavior. First, a givenprey could benefit from a lower capture probability with a given predator thatmakes a second attack, since the prey response to the second attack will bedifferent than in the first attack, avoiding costs through predator learning.Second, a given prey may benefit from its unpredictable behavior with respect toa whole population of predators. In this case, individuals in the whole preypopulation could benefit from protean behavior because the predator populationcannot use any countermeasures for predicting the response of the prey.Jones et al.’s (2011 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.52]) work is a startingpoint for the exploration of the influence of protean behavior on predator–preyencounters. One useful extension of the work would be to allow the preypopulation to evolve subject to selection imposed by the human predators inorder to explore what the optimal strategy is in terms of motion that hindersprey capture. This is very much like the approach that has been used to studyadaptive coloration in artificial prey presented on a computer screen to birdstrained to peck at discovered targets to obtain a reward (Bond & Kamil 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.7]). Based on analysis of the trajectory ofthe “predatory” cursor combined with eye-tracking equipment, it should bepossible to study the gaze of human subjects to gain an improved understandingof the tactics used by humans in their prey pursuit and why protean behavior isable to exploit cognitive limitations of predators. This in turn might inform aco-evolutionary system in which the human predators are replaced bycomputer-generated predators whose actions are controlled by a set of rules thatcan be subject to selection and modification in just the same way as the prey.However, perhaps the most exciting way to progress and expand on the work ofJones et al. (2011 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.52]) would to be tointroduce realistic physical dynamics for both the prey and the predator. In thesimulations of Jones et al. (2011 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.52]) boththe prey and predators moved at a constant forward speed that is unaffected byturning. In reality there are physical constraints on individuals that determineturning rates; and trade-offs between forward speed and turning radius, andbetween speed and maneuverability (Domenici 2001[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.21], 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.23]). We see great advantage in addingrealistic physical constraints to the cognitive limitations considered by Joneset al. (2011 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.52]). Exploration of how thischanges the predictions of the previous study would be very fruitful.Methods of incorporating physical relationships and constraints have arelatively long history, stretching back at least as far as the influentialmodeling study of Howland (1974 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.44]). Thispaper explored a “turning gambit” whereby prey that has a slower straight-linespeed than a pursuing predator might be able to escape the predator. This isbased on a number of modeling “rules.” First, slower prey speed comes with acompensatory advantage of smaller turning radius. Second, the prey can gauge thecorrect time to initiate a turn (in terms of the proximity of the predatorbehind it). Third, sufficient increase in separation, as a result of thismaneuver, would make the predator return to chasing it from immediately behindat greater than the critical distance at which maneuvers are triggered. Noticethat these turns can be predictable and the benefit to the prey comes fromphysics rather than cognition. Hence, it would be a very natural extension ofthis work to introduce more unpredictable “protean” movements by prey andexplore whether there are circumstances where the cognitive benefits ofconfusing the predator can overcome any dynamical costs of this behavior. Thus,the marriage of the cognitive and physical approaches to understandingmaneuvering in predator–prey chases offers rewards to both theoreticaltraditions. Another potentially useful addition to the theory would be explicitconsideration of differing rates at which energy is used in different maneuvers.8.3.4 MODIFICATION OF ESCAPE TRAJECTORIES IN THE PRESENCE OF CONSPECIFICSFor many animals that live in groups, it is not possible for the prey to detectthe specific individual that has been targeted, and indeed the predator may nothave selected a specific target when the point when prey start fleeing. This isespecially likely when predatory attacks are launched from outside the group.Thus, a number of individuals may flee almost simultaneously. The modificationof individual trajectories in the presence of conspecifics may have a number offunctions: collision avoidance, placing conspecifics between a fleeingindividuals and the predator (selfish herd effects), and predator confusion.It seems clear that fleeing individuals should avoid colliding into each other,because such collisions might cause injury, attract the attention of thepredator, and impair flight. It has long been postulated that avoidance ofcollisions might influence ETs (Hall et al. 1986[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.38]; Domenici & Batty 1997[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.25]), and that avoidance of collisions mayexplain the similar orientation of nearby individuals often seen in fish shoalsand bird flocks. However, empirical exploration of this is exceptionallychallenging and evidence of predators taking advantage of collisions is limitedto a small number of anecdotal observations.The selfish herd hypothesis was first put forward by Hamilton (1971[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.39]). He proposed that when predators attackthe first prey individual that comes within a certain distance of them, thisbehavior should select for prey aggregation by prey. By being part of anaggregation, an individual reduces the size of its “domain of danger,” theregion of space where, if a predator is present at any point, the focalindividual would be the nearest individual to the predator. Hence, aggregationscan form not necessarily as part of a collective defense mechanism, but becausea number of individuals are all selfishly trying to place other individualsbetween themselves and possible points on the predator’s expected trajectory.Increased aggregation in the face of imminent threat of predatory attack hasbeen recorded for a number of taxa (reviewed by Krause & Ruxton 2002[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.55]). Several modeling studies have exploredpaths that individuals might adopt, which can explain this increased aggregationthrough selfish-herd effects. Viscido et al. (2001[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.79], 2002[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.80]) and Reluga and Viscido (2005[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.66]), in simulations parameterized by theirstudy of groups of fiddler crabs (Uca), demonstrated that even when flight awayfrom an approaching predator occurs, selfish avoidance of danger can lead to anincrease in aggregation.The confusion effect describes the decreased likelihood that a predator willsuccessfully catch any prey as group size of moving prey increases. Themechanism behind this is essentially “sensory overload.” In predators faced withvery high levels of informational input, the sensory and cognitive systems maystruggle to track one particular prey item without being distracted by others.This effect has been demonstrated in simulation models that use neural networksto simulate predator sensory and cognitive systems (Krakauer 1995[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.54]; Tosh et al. 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.75]). It has also been demonstrated across awide range of predator–prey pairs (reviewed by Jeschke & Tollrian 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.51]; see also Ioannou et al. 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.48]) for an effective combination ofmodeling and empirical testing to demonstrate that reduced attack success can belinked to increased spatial targeting error. Jeschke and Tollrian (2007[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.51]) made the important point that althoughthe confusion effect is often discussed with respect to visual predators, theavailable empirical evidence suggests that it may be even stronger in tactilepredators. The confusion effect seems particularly strong when prey individualslook and behave similarly (see Krakauer 1995[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.54] for theory and Landeau & Terborgh 1986[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.58] for empirical evidence). This may impactthe behavior shown by fleeing prey, selecting for similarity in descriptors oftheir movement.Recent theory and empirical evidence (Tosh et al. 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.75]; Ruxton et al. 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.68]) has demonstrated that behaviors thatproduce tight cohesion of a group may not be required for prey to benefit frompredator confusion, and that complex coordinated behaviors between prey are notrequired. This issue was further explored by Jones et al. (2011[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.52]) in experiments in which humans werechallenged to capture (using a cursor controlled by a mouse) a specific targetfrom an aggregation of targets on a computer screen. Protean prey (that showedless predictable movement trajectories) were more difficult to capture, but thiseffect was not influenced by the number of targets. That is, protean escapebehaviors provided a direct antipredator benefit but did not enhance theconfusion effect (which had previously been demonstrated to occur in a similarexperimental set-up by Tosh et al. 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.75]). Recently, Ioannou et al. (2012[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.49]) demonstrated that similarity of motionbetween group members could offer enhanced protection. They allowed realpredators to hunt mobile virtual prey (computer-controlled images projected ontothe side of the predator fish’s tank). Prey whose movement rules included atendency to be attracted toward, and to align direction of travel with, nearneighbors, tended to form mobile coordinated groups that were rarely attackedcompared to more isolated individuals.The individual’s ET can be influenced by the behavior of simultaneously fleeingnearby individuals. However, this can occur through a number of different andnon-exclusive mechanisms, and our understanding of the relative importance ofthese mechanisms is still very rudimentary. A similar conclusion can be drawn ata higher level about trajectories more generally. In this section we haveconsidered a number of factors that are likely to influence escape trajectories,but model systems have yet to emerge that would help us to probe the relativeimportance of these different influences.8.4 SENSORY DEFENSES AND SIGNALING LINKED TO FLEEINGSome prey can enhance their ability to flee from predators by communicating withother individuals. Often predators may approach or chase prey that areimpossible or too expensive (in time, energy, risk of injury, risk of disturbingother potential prey, and/or risk of attracting hyperpredators) to catch (seeChapters 2 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#CN-bp-2] and 10[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#CN-bp-10]). If the prey can honestly inform a chasingpredator of such a situation and the predator responds by breaking off thechase, then both parties benefit. However, it might appear that the prey couldbenefit by dishonest signaling in this regard, causing the predator to break offits attack on occasions when this would not be in the predator’s best interests.In the first part of this section we explore the conditions required for more orless honest signaling of this nature to evolve and be maintained. There may alsobe occasions when the fleeing prey should signal to the chasing predator thatalthough it may be possible and economic to catch the prey, subduing the caughtindividual will be impossible or prohibitively expensive, and we explore suchsignaling also. Finally, we explore signaling to other individuals that mightoccur because alerted individuals can be induced to break up the chase (e.g., bymobbing the predator).8.4.1 SIGNALING VIGOR TO PREDATORSDuring pursuit some prey may signal to predators that the prey will be difficultto catch. The key issue for researchers is to understand under what conditionssuch a signal might be reliable, given that low-quality prey apparently havestrong incentive to signal dishonestly. Vega-Redondo and Hasson (1993[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.78]) explored this issue theoretically.Their key finding is that an evolutionarily stable signaling equilibrium existsat which the two prey types issue different signals and the predator respondsdifferentially to those signals (attacking one type of signaler, but not theother). The equilibrium is evolutionarily stable, providing a number ofconditions are satisfied. The key conditions are:1. An attack on a higher quality individual is less likely to be successful thanan attack on a poor-quality individual if both signal identically.2. If intensity of signaling increases then the relative decrease in theprobability of an attack being successful is greater for the higher qualityindividual than the lower quality one. Thus the cost of a more intensive signalis greater for a low-quality individual than for a high-quality individual.3. If signal intensity becomes small enough then the predator’s attack is alwayssuccessful.Tests of this theory are relatively scarce. Cresswell (1994[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.20]) reported on extensive and carefullyrecorded naturally occurring predation events by a raptorial bird (merlin, Falcocolumbarius) attacking a songbird (skylark, Alauda arvensis). The merlin clearlyselected a skylark for pursuit before any song by the skylark was heard. Ifsinging by the skylark was heard (by Cresswell), then it started very soon afterthe pursuit began. For pursuits where the merlin gave up without capture,merlins chased non-singing or poorly singing skylarks for longer periodscompared to skylarks that sang well. These chases often exceeded five minutes induration, implying that the costs of not signaling and not responding to thesignal were high for the skylark and merlin, respectively. Merlins were morelikely to catch non-singing than singing skylarks. Skylarks that did not singwhen attacked were more likely to attempt to hide from the merlin rather thanoutfly it. The author noted that it has not been demonstrated that singing whilebeing pursued is costly even though singing in the absence of pursuit isenergetically demanding for skylarks (Cresswell 1994[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.20]). In all other respects this study comesvery close to a convincing demonstration of pursuit-deterrence signaling.8.4.2 CUES OR SIGNALS OF PHYSICAL OR CHEMICAL DEFENSES REVEALED DURING FLEEINGFor many prey, fleeing slowly on a predictable trajectory will increase theirrisk of predation, especially for undefended prey that can be subdued easily andconsumed when caught. However, it is possible that simply fleeing slowly on apredictable trajectory (e.g., travelling slowly on a constant heading unaffectedby predator position) is used as a cue (and perhaps even an evolved signal) thatthe fleeing organism is sufficiently defended to be difficult to subdue orunpalatable to eat if caught. Fleeing may still be advantageous to such defendedindividuals because attacks may be costly to the prey even if they areunsuccessful. Marden and Chai (1991 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.60])surveyed 124 Neotropical butterfly species and found that those that weresufficiently chemically defended to be unpalatable to vertebrate predators had alower fraction of their body devoted to flight muscles than undefended species;the same was true for mimics of such species. Srygley (1994[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.70]) reported similar results in acomparative study of 18 species of the butterfly tribe Heliconiini and 10 oftheir non-heliconiine co-mimics. Palatable species that were not mimics ofunpalatable species had increased flight speed and maneuverability. Srygley andDudley (1993 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.71]) in experiments in cagesfound that relative to distasteful species, palatable butterfly species flewfaster and were more able to maneuver successfully to evade attacks byinsectivorous birds. Sluggish movement seems to be a cue that could be used bypredators.Hatle et al. (2001 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.41]) demonstrated that infrog attacks on lubber grasshoppers, sluggish movement and aversive odors acttogether to reduce predation rates, whereas neither trait was effective alone.Hatle et al. (2002 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.42]) explored preyselection when the Northern leopard frog (Lithobates pipiens) was presentedaggregations of grasshoppers. The fastest moving individual in an aggregation ofsuch aposematic individuals was most vulnerable to attack. Sluggish fleeing,then, can be used by predators as a somewhat reliable cue that the prey would beunattractive to attack. What remains unclear is if this slow flight of defendedindividuals is simply a cue driven by a lack of selection pressure to invest inevasion compared to the undefended, or whether this cue has evolved into asignal that has a communicative function. Sherratt et al. (2004[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.69]) used a simulation model to show thatsuch signals are theoretically possible, but such signaling has not beenempirically demonstrated.8.4.3 SIGNALING TO OTHERS DURING FLEEINGFleeing individuals may signal to animals other than the pursuing individual.For instance, individuals might signal to request for help from individuals thatmight themselves benefit from the pursuit of the focal individual beingunsuccessful. For example, a juvenile calling to a parent that might be able toattack the pursuer. A fleeing prey might signal to encourage conspecifics orheterospecifics to mob the pursuer because the mobbers benefit from the attackon the focal individual failing through kin selection, or because the predatoris less likely to return to the same area to hunt after a failed attack. Anotheroften-postulated idea is that calls by the fleeing individual might alert eitherpredators or competitors of the pursuing animal. Intervention by such animalsmight provide increased potential for the signaler to escape.Alarm calls (communicating information about imminent danger of predation) havebeen intensively studied with respect to their informational content, theecological correlates of their use, and the responsiveness of conspecific andheterospecific receivers (see Caro 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.12],for an overview). However, the linkage between calling and any otherantipredatory behaviors of the caller have been almost entirely neglected. Inparticular, it is likely that some callers will also flee from the predator, andsome calling may occur during flight. It would be interesting to explore whethersuch calling is different from calls emitted prior to fleeing or those emittedby non-fleeing individuals.So called “distress calls” or “fear screams” that are produced by a range ofbirds, mammals, and anurans when physically contacted by a predator have alsobeen studied widely (see Ruxton et al. 2004[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.67]; Caro 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#REFe-r-8.12], for reviews). Such screams arevariously suggested to startle predators, attract competitors of the predator,encourage mobbing, or act as a warning to kin. Many of these benefits might beenhanced if such calls were initiated prior to the prey actually falling intothe grip of the predator. However, such anticipatory distress calls have notbeen widely reported, nor has there been consideration of whether suchanticipation might be excessively costly or ineffective. We would welcomeexploration of the effects of distress calls on probability of escape and ofwhether distress calls are initiated prior to capture (while the prey is stillin flight from the predator) and if not, why not.8.5 CONCLUSIONSBehavioral choices by prey during fleeing can influence the chance of beingcaptured in multiple ways. In terms of the locomotor component of fleeing, preyhave to deal with the laws of biomechanics, the performance of their sensorysystems, and the need to generate unpredictability. Signaling while fleeing mayincrease the chances of survival because signaling then can deter a predatorfrom chasing and it can strengthen the effect of collective antipredatorbehaviors. We believe that progress in this field will require integration of anumber of fields of biology, such as behavioral ecology, biomechanics, andsensory biology. We thus hope to have pointed to some relatively tractable areaswhere current understanding of fleeing could be strengthened.REFERENCESAllan, B. J. M., Miller, G. M., McCormick, M.

Safer habitatswhere animals restrict most of their activity to avoid exposure to potentialpredators found in other places are often called refuges or refugia (e.g.,Werner et al. 1983 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.97]). That is not ourmeaning of refuge in this chapter. Here, a refuge refers to small portions ofthe habitat where a prey hides temporarily after escaping from a predator thathas been detected or that has attacked the prey. By definition, a refuge is aphysical structure or some part of a habitat where the predator cannot enter tofollow and capture the prey, or is at least impeded from doing so. Thereforepredation risk immediately decreases, sometimes to zero, when the prey enters arefuge and hides inside it.Numerous studies have shown that prey often respond to predator presence byincreasing their use of refuges or safe microhabitats (Lima & Dill 1990[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.58]; Sih et al. 1992[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.89]). However, most prey animals do notspend their lives in the safety of a refuge (Sih 1997[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.87]) because by staying in refuges preyoften incur some fitness costs that should be minimized (e.g., the loss of timeavailable for foraging; Godin & Sproul 1988[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.38]; Koivula et al. 1995[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.51]; Dill & Fraser 1997[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.33]; Martín et al. 2003a[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.70]; Blumstein & Pelletier 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.8]; or mate searching; Sih et al. 1990[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.88]; Martín et al. 2003b[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.71]; Reaney 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.81]). Unfavorable conditions in refuges(e.g., suboptimal temperatures or oxygen levels) might also entail physiologicalcosts, such as hypothermia or hypoxia (Wolf & Kramer 1987[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.99]; Martín & López 1999b[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.62]; Polo et al. 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.78]). And, finally, refuges are often usefulagainst some types of predators, but can expose of prey to other type ofpredators, which can cause a conflict in refuge use (Soluk 1993[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.93]; Sih et al. 1998[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.90]; Amo et al. 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.4]).9.2 THE OPTIMAL HIDING TIMEBecause refuge use is often costly, prey should optimize the time spent hidinginside a refuge and elect to use alternative escape strategies if refuge costsare too high. Some theoretical models have analyzed when prey should decide toleave the refuge and resume their behavior after a predator’s unsuccessfulattack (see Chapter 2 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#CN-bp-2] for details). Thehiding decision should be made based on the balance between the cost of beingoutside the refuge (i.e., predation risk) and the costs of refuge use. Thisdecision is very important, as suggested by a state-dependent dynamic model thatexplored potential fitness consequences of hiding decisions in yellow-belliedmarmots (Marmota flaviventris; Rhoades & Blumstein 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.82]). This model suggested that the overallsurvival of a population is substantially reduced when individuals makesuboptimal hiding decisions (e.g., hiding 50% less or 200% more than the optimalhiding time substantially decreases the likelihood of survival). Becauseindividuals need simultaneously to acquire energy and avoid predation,individuals making incorrect decisions could either starve or be killed.Economic models of refuge use predict that prey should choose to leave a refugewhen the cost of refuge use is higher than the risk to fitness of predationoutside (Martín & López 1999a [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.61]; Cooper &Frederick 2007 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.25]; see Chapter 2[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#CN-bp-2] for details and graphs). The optimal hidingtime will be modified in two ways. First, when the rate of reduction ofpredation risk decreases, the time spent in the refuge should increase. Second,when the costs of refuge use increase, the time spent in the refuge shoulddecrease.Economic models make three predictions. (1) Time spent in the refuge should belonger when the threat of the initial attack has been higher, and therefore thesubsequent diminution of risk is slower (i.e., the probability of a new attackafter emergence is higher). (2) Time spent in the refuge should be longer whencosts of refuge use are lower. (3) The effects of costs of refuge use should bemore important in the high-risk situation. In the low-risk situation, preyshould emerge after a short period of time (when predation risk level drops),regardless of levels of costs of refuge use.Optimality models consider the costs and benefits of all the possible strategiesan animal could adopt, and predict which should be the optimal decision thatmaximizes fitness. These models predict that the optimal hiding time shouldincrease with initial fitness and decrease as the maximum benefit that can beobtained by not hiding increases (Cooper & Frederick 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.25]; see Chapter 2[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#CN-bp-2] for details and graphs). Initial fitness isimportant because prey having high residual reproductive value should be morecautious to protect this “reproductive asset” (Clark 1994[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.15]) by remaining hidden for longer.However, when the benefits obtainable by emerging are greater, prey shouldaccept greater risk, and have shorter hiding times. If large benefits areretainable after death, prey may emerge and allow themselves to be killed. Thesepredictions are similar to those from the previous economic models. However,optimality models make the new predictions. One is that emergence time increaseswith initial fitness and varies with the exponent in the benefit function. Thesecond prediction, that prey may risk being killed by emerging for largebenefits retainable after death, is unique to the optimal hiding time model.9.3 EXPERIMENTAL TESTS OF THE PREDICTIONS OF HIDING TIME MODELSModels of refuge use make many ordinal level and quantitative predictions abouthiding or emergence time based on the balance between the benefits of stayinghidden (i.e., risk of emerging) and the costs incurred while hiding in therefuge (i.e., cost of not emerging) (Sih 1992[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.86]; Martín & López 1999a[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.61]; Cooper & Frederick 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.25]).One example of an experimental test of the predictions from optimal hidingmodels (see Chapter 2 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#CN-bp-2]) is a field study thatanalyzed the variation in hiding time in a refuge (rock crevices) in the Iberianrock-lizard, Iberolacerta cyreni, under two different simulated predation risklevels and under different thermal costs of refuge use (Martín & López 1999a[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.61]). As predicted by the economic models,lizards hid longer when the risk level of the initial attack was high, andtherefore the subsequent reduction of risk with time is slower (Figure 9.1b[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#FIGm-fig-58]). However, lizards may reduce hidingtime in the refuge while also minimizing predation risk by walking while hiddenunder rock screes to reappear at a different place, leaving the predator waitingfor the prey to appear at the wrong place (Figure 9.1[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#FIGm-fig-58]). Interestingly, only individuals withinitial high body temperatures seem able to adopt this alternative strategy.[OEBPS_Images_image00953.jpeg]Figure 9.1(a) Predation risk level affects refuge use by the Iberian rock lizard,Iberolacerta cyreni. (b) Hiding times (mean ± SE) in a refuge after a predatoryattack are shown under two levels of risk. Responses change depending on whetherlizards emerge from the site of refuge entry or at a different site.(Figure 9.1a: photograph by J. Martín; Figure 9.1b: redrawn from Martín & López1999a [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.61])On the other hand, effects of thermal costs are more important in high-risksituations. Under high-risk situations, time spent in the refuge increases whenthermal conditions of the refuge are more similar to thermal conditions outside(i.e., when physiological costs of refuge use are lower) (Figure 9.2[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#FIGm-fig-59]). Under these high-risk situations,hiding time is correlated with the temperature differential if lizards emergefrom the point of refuge entry, but not when lizards emerge from differentplaces. In low-risk situations, the place of emergence has no effect on therelationship between temperature differential and hiding time.[OEBPS_Images_image00954.jpeg]Figure 9.2Thermal costs affect refuge use by Iberian rock lizards, Iberolacerta cyreni.Relationships observed between hiding time in a refuge after a predatory attackand the difference between the external temperature (Text) and the refugetemperature (Tref) under two levels of risk. Thermal cost of refuge use ishigher when this difference is greater because body temperature decreases fasterin refuge as refuge temperature decreases relative to the outside temperature.(Redrawn from Martín & López 1999a [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.61])In addition to this first test of the economic model by Martín and López (1999a[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.61]) that examined effects of both predationrisk and cost of hiding, predictions of models of optimal hiding time have beenverified consistently for various specific costs and benefits in severalobservational and experimental studies (Table 9.1[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#TBLm-tblw-14]). These are discussed in the remainingsections of this chapter. Of the studies carried out on hiding behavior, therehas been a strong bias toward a few species of lizards, with only a minorfraction of studies made with other animals, such as fish, crabs, insects,marmots, etc.Table 9.1 Studies examining variation in hiding time (or related variables)depending on several factors in different taxa.

This occurs because after some waiting time most predators will leavethe area (Hugie 2003 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.46]). Thus theprobability that the predator is waiting for the prey outside the refuge (i.e.,probability of a new attack) decreases as hiding time increases. All theoreticalmodels of refuge use predict that hiding time should increase as the initialrisk increases or the rate of diminution of predation risk with time decreases(Martín & López 1999a [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.61]; Cooper &Frederick 2007 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.25]; see Chapter 2[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#CN-bp-2]). This has been confirmed for several typesof risks in many studies cited below.9.3.1.1 RISK DUE TO THE PREDATOR’S BEHAVIORAfter entering a refuge, prey may assess predation risk level in the exteriorfrom the characteristics of the predator’s behavior during approach, or thepredator’s attack behavior before the prey hides. Predation risk may vary inrelation to the threat and characteristics of the immediately previous encounterwith the predator (Stankowich & Blumstein 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.94]). The reduction of predation risk mightbe very fast when the prey has retreated into the refuge as a preventivestrategy to elude a detected predator that has not yet attacked. In contrast, ina high predation risk situation (e.g., a direct attack by the predator), theinitial level of predation risk is higher, and risk will diminish more slowlywith time because the predator is known to pose a greater threat to the prey.When a simulated predator approaches the prey faster, which indicates higherrisk, subsequent hiding times are longer in several species of lizards(broad-headed skinks, Plestiodon laticeps:Cooper 1998[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.16]; Iberian rock lizards, Iberolacertacyreni: Cooper et al. 2003 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.28]; Martín &López 1999a [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.61], 2001[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.63]; wall lizards, Podarcis muralis: Martín& López 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.68]; striped plateau lizards,Sceloporus virgatus: Cooper 2009a [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.18]; andBalearic lizards, Podarcis lilfordi: Cooper et al. 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.30]; Figure 9.3[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#FIGm-fig-60]). In contrast, yellow-bellied marmotshide longer in response to a slower approach of the predator (Rhoades &Blumstein 2007 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.82]), probably becausemarmots may consider a slow approach more dangerous as many of their predatorsslowly stalk their prey.[OEBPS_Images_image00955.jpeg]Figure 9.3Effects of several risk factors on refuge use by Balearic lizards, Podarcislilfordi (d). Time spent hiding in refuges (mean + SE) by lizards (a) increaseslinearly with predator approach speed; (b) is greater following direct thanindirect approaches that bypass the prey without contact at medium approachspeed, but not at the fast approach speed; and (c) is longer when the predatorstays near the refuge than farther from it, and the difference between proximitylevels of the predator is greater after approaches at the fast than the mediumspeed.(Graphs redrawn from Cooper et al. 2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.30];photograph by J. Martín)The directness of a predator’s approach is another cue that prey use to assessrisk. Predators approaching tangentially might not be attacking, whereasdirectly approaching predators are more likely to have detected the prey and bepreparing to attack. Therefore hiding time is predicted to be longer for directthan indirect approaches. As predicted, when a predator has approached directly,fiddler crabs (Uca lactea perplexa; Jennions et al. 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.47]) and several lizards (Martín & López1999a [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.61], 2004a[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.66], 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.68]; Cooper et al. 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.28], 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.23]; Cooper 2009a[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.18]) have longer hiding times than when apredator has approached indirectly (Figure 9.3[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#FIGm-fig-60]).A predator that is closer when first detected or that remains closer to therefuge after the attack may be considered a higher risk leading to longer hidingtimes in fiddler crabs (Jennions et al. 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.47]), skinks and other lizards (Cooper 1998[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.16], 2009a[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.18]; Cooper et al. 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.30]; Figure 9.3[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#FIGm-fig-60]). However, in American bullfrogs,Lithobates catesbeianus, time spent submerged after escaping by jumping intowater was uncorrelated with proximity of the predator upon escape (Cooper 2011b[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.22]). This contradiction may be explainedbecause frogs may need to surface to determine whether the predator remainsnearby, and can submerge themselves again if so.Prey responses may also depend on the subtle characteristics of each individualpredator, which may be considered to pose different risk levels (Cooper et al.2003 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.28]). Also, a prey that was able toescape from a predator that has captured it temporarily may, in a subsequentencounter, assess that this predator, or a similar one, poses a greater risk,and therefore increase hiding time (Cooper & Wilson 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.27]; Figure 9.4[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#FIGm-fig-61]). Duration of handling by the predatorbefore escaping also affected hiding times in fiddler crabs (Jennions et al.2003 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.47]) and turtles (Martín et al. 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.72]).[OEBPS_Images_image00956.jpeg]Figure 9.4Effects of a previous capture by the predator and tail autotomy on refuge use bystriped plateau lizards, Sceloporus virgatus. Hiding time (mean + SE) is longerfollowing both tail autotomy and capture than in the uncaptured, unhandledcontrol treatment, and longer following autotomy than just capture and handling.(Redrawn from Cooper & Wilson 2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.27])Multiple repeated approaches also may represent a higher risk, which results inlonger hiding times for the second of two consecutive attacks in several lizardspecies (Cooper 1998 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.16], 2011a[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.21]; Martín & López 2001[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.63], 2004a[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.66], 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.68]; Cooper & Avalos 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.23]; Cooper et al. 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.30]). Similarly, after the first attack,most individuals of the lizard Acanthodactylus erythrurus do not hide, but stopafter running in the open and remain vigilant; whereas in subsequent attackswithin a brief interval, lizards use increasingly safer, structurally morecomplex bush refuges (i.e., larger and with more obstructive cover; Martín &López 2003a [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.64]). These data suggest thatpersistent predatory attacks increase predation risk and prey adjust hiding timeto correspond with the risk level. However, the outcome of several multipleattacks may be harder to predict than for only two successive attacks becausethere are usually interactions with other predation risk factors or changes inrisk level between attacks (Martín & López 2001[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.63], 2004a[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.66], 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.68]; Polo et al. 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.78]). These combined multiple effects willbe examined below in more detail (see section 9.6[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#aid-KVD48]).Prey may perceive a higher risk when a given individual predator is persistent.Individual recognition of the predator may not be needed if the assessment isbased solely on attack rate. Similarly, prey might respond to an increase in thedensity of different individual predators (Cooper 1998[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.16]). Thus aquatic bugs Notonecta hoffmani,increase hiding time in response to increased predator density (Sih 1992[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.86]). Nevertheless, some prey may be able touse the time interval between successive attacks to estimate whether repeatedattacks are originated by the same individual predator, which would indicatepersistence of the same individual predator (i.e., high risk), or as independentsingle attacks by different predators or by the same predator but with lowmotivation (i.e., low risk) (Martín & López 2004a[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.66]).Finally, in contrast to flight initiation distance (see Chapter 2[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#CN-bp-2]), hiding time seems unaffected by thepredator’s starting distance (predator to prey distance when approach begins) inthe lizard Sceloporus virgatus (Cooper 2011a[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.21]), which suggests that once a prey entersrefuge, the SD is irrelevant to predation risk upon emergence. However, it islikely that prey dynamically increase their assessed risk such that when thereare longer approach times (which should be correlated with SD), there is greaterperceived risk (Cooper & Blumstein 2014[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.24]). Under such conditions, hiding timeshould also increase as SD increases, just as it increases with increases inother risk factors during the approach.9.3.1.2 RISK DUE TO THE PREY’S CHARACTERISTICSThe prey’s own characteristics, such as body size and age, may affect riskperception and refuge use. Small juvenile aquatic bugs Notonecta hoffmani(instar 1) are more susceptible to predation by adults than are large juveniles(instar 3); accordingly, small juveniles show longer hiding times (Sih 1992[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.86]). Similarly, smaller barnacles, Balanusglandula, have longer hiding times than larger ones (Dill & Gillett 1991[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.34]). In contrast, large fish often hidelonger than small ones (Krause et al. 1998[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.53], 2000a[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.54],b[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.55]; Dowling & Godin 2002[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.36]), possibly because, although at higherrisk from predators upon emergence, small fish have higher costs of lost feedingopportunities by hiding than do large fish. Similarly, yellow-bellied marmotpups emerge sooner than adults, which is also consistent with the costs of lostopportunities because marmot pups will not survive hibernation unless they gainsufficient body mass in their first year (Blumstein & Pelletier 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.8]). It is also possible that young animalsmust learn about how to respond to risks. In addition, consistent differences inboldness between otherwise similar individuals may affect their risk perceptionand therefore their refuge use (Blumstein & Pelletier 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.8]; López et al. 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.59]; Cooper 2009c[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.20]; see Chapter 14[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#CN-bp-14] for more studies and details).More conspicuous individuals suffer a greater risk of being detected bypredators and therefore should increase hiding time. Male rock lizards,Iberolacerta monticola, have bright-blue UV lateral ocelli that serve as sexualsignals, but also make males conspicuous to predators. They seem to compensatefor greater conspicuousness by increasing hiding time in proportion to thenumber of these conspicuous ocelli (Cabido et al. 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.13]). By contrast, males of a sister lizardspecies, I. cyreni, that have fewer and less conspicuous ocelli, do not varyhiding time (Cabido et al. 2009 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.13]).Similar behavioral compensation for increasing conspicuousness of displayingmales to predators or parasites has been reported in other animals. For example,male field crickets, Gryllus integer, with longer, more conspicuous, songsbehave more cautiously than males with shorter songs; they take longer to emergefrom a shelter within a novel, potentially dangerous environment, and they ceasecalling for a longer time when their calls are interrupted by a predator cue(Hedrick 2000 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.41]). Similarly, in the fieldcricket, Teleogryllus oceanicus, latency to resume calling after disturbancecorresponds to population-level differences in risk of being parasitized(Lewkiewicz & Zuk 2004 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.56]). And vividlycolored birds are more responsive to the sounds of their aerial predators(Journey et al. 2013 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.50]).The ability of the prey to escape again from a predator after emerging from arefuge also influences predation risk and may affect hiding times. For example,lizards that escape by autotomizing their tails subsequently have decreasedescape speed and lose the ability to use autotomy again. Thus the risk of beingcaptured upon emergence is greater after an experimentally induced autotomy,which leads to longer hiding times in the lizard Sceloporus virgatus (Cooper &Wilson 2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.27]) (Figure 9.4[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#FIGm-fig-61]). Also, field crickets, Gryllusbimaculatus, that have lost legs by autotomy have longer hiding times thanintact individuals (Bateman & Fleming 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.7]).Finally, the risk dilution effect of being in a group remains almost unexploredin relation to hiding time after a predator attack. However, freshwater pearlmussels, Margaritifera margaritifera, that were in a group closed their valvesfor shorter times than solitary mussels after experiencing potentially dangerousnovel stimuli (Wilson et al. 2012 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.98]).9.3.1.3 “WAITING GAMES” BETWEEN PREDATOR AND PREYHiding in a refuge increases safety, but may restrict further information frombeing obtained about the risk associated with the waiting predator. When thisoccurs, the individual predator and prey involved become opponents in a‘‘waiting game” (Hugie 2003 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.46]). The preymust decide how long to wait for the predator to depart before emerging andpotentially exposing itself to attack. The predator must decide how long to waitfor the prey to emerge before departing in search of other foragingopportunities. Waiting is assumed to be costly to both players. Hugie (2003[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.46]) used a game-theoretical model todetermine the evolutionarily stable waiting strategy of both players. The modelpredicts that each player’s waiting distribution (i.e., the distribution ofwaiting times expected for individuals in each role) will have a characteristicshape: the predator’s distribution should resemble a negative exponentialfunction, whereas the waiting time of the prey is predicted to be more variableand follow a positively skewed distribution. The model also predicts that thepredator will rarely outwait the prey.Illustrating this relationship, Johansson and Englund (1995[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.49]) studied a waiting game betweenbullheads, Cottus gobio, which are predatory fish, and casemaking caddis flylarvae, Halesus radiatus. After an unsuccessful attack by a bullhead, a larvaremains motionless with its head and legs hidden in a case of organic debris.The bullhead usually responds by orienting toward the larva and remainingmotionless. Measures of waiting times of prey and predator reveal a good fitwith the predictions of Hugie’s (2003 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.46])waiting-game model. Furthermore, as predicted, the predator rarely outwaited theprey: only 1.5% of larvae re-emerged before the bullhead had departed.9.3.2 COSTS OF REFUGE USE DETERMINING HIDING TIMEWhen deciding hiding times, prey should consider several costs of refuge use,which are mainly the loss of opportunities for obtaining food or reproductivebenefits outside the refuge, and the physiological costs associated withunfavorable conditions inside refuges. The potential for encountering othertypes of predators inside the refuge is another cost in some situations.Theoretical models predict that the optimal hiding time should decrease as thecosts of refuge use increase (Sih 1992 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.86];Martín & López 1999a [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.61]; Cooper & Frederick2007 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.25], see Chapter 2[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#CN-bp-2]). Several empirical studies have examinedhow specific costs affect hiding decisions.9.3.2.1 LOSS OF FORAGING OPPORTUNITIESThe cost of remaining hidden in a refuge often varies with food availabilityoutside the refuge, especially when food becomes available in a food-limitedenvironment. Therefore many animals take more risks when food levels are high.For example, the tubeworm, Serpula vermicularis, alters hiding time inside itstube with fluctuating food levels in the environment. It emerges from its tubesooner when food is abundant, thereby avoiding greater opportunity cost ofremaining in the tube than when food is scarce (Dill & Fraser 1997[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.33]; Figure 9.5[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#FIGm-fig-62]). Moreover, tubeworms adjust theirhiding times in response to short-term experimental changes in foodavailability. Similarly, juveniles of a small freshwater minnow, Semotilusatromaculatus, spent less time in a safe area that protected them from predatorsas food level increased outside in the riskier environment (Gilliam & Fraser1987 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.39]).[OEBPS_Images_image00957.jpeg]Figure 9.5Effects of loss of opportunities for foraging by polychaete worms, Serpulavermicularis, on time spent retreated inside their calcareous tubes. Hidingtimes (mean ± SE) of two groups of serpulids before and after a change in foodavailability (A) from 1 ml of food suspension to 10 ml or (B) from 10 ml to 1ml. Values plotted are the means of the average hiding times in several testdays for individual tubeworms in the two treatment groups. The low horizontalbars represent the amount of a standard algal suspension provided daily to eachtank.(Redrawn from Dill & Fraser 1997 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.33])Iberian rock lizards, Iberolacerta cyreni, have shorter hiding times when theyhave detected food before entering refuge than when they have not (Martín et al.2003a [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.70]). This was demonstrated byexperimentally introducing a mealworm or control stimulus outside the refugeimmediately before a simulated attack (“R” and “RNW” treatments vs. “NF”treatment in Figure 9.6 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#FIGm-fig-63]). Avoiding theapproaching predator is probably the main priority in the absence of food.However, when a lizard hidden in refuge can observe that the prey that it wastrying to capture before the predator attacked (“R” treatment), or a new fooditem provided after the attack (“RNW” treatment) is available outside therefuge, the benefit expected to be gained by emerging from the refuge ispresumably higher than the expected cost due to predation risk. Based on thisassessment, lizards rapidly emerge. Furthermore, the success of the encounterwith food before the attack, and the added possibility of capturing either a newfood item, or one that had been available, but not captured when the lizard hidafter the predator appeared, differentially affects the magnitude of the costsof refuge use and, consequently, hiding duration. Lizards that have just eaten aprey before the attack (“E” treatment) have longer hiding times than lizardsthat have not eaten it (“R” treatment) (Figure 9.6[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#FIGm-fig-63]). Lizards with a better nutritionalstate may delay resuming foraging to decrease predation risk. However, when anew prey is offered after the attack (“ENW” and “RNW” treatments), hiding timesdecrease greatly in both groups independently of the nutritional state (Martínet al. 2003a [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.70]; Figure 9.6[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#FIGm-fig-63]).[OEBPS_Images_image00958.jpeg]Figure 9.6Effects of the loss of opportunities for foraging on refuge use by rock lizards,Iberolacerta cyreni. Hiding times (mean ± SE) of lizards after a predatoryattack under different experimental treatments of food availability andsatiation (NF: no food; E: lizards eat a prey before the attack; ENW: lizardseat a prey before the attack and new food offered after the attack; R: foodpresented but removed before eating and before the attack; RNW: food removedbefore eating but new food offered after the attack.(Redrawn from Martín et al. 2003a [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.70])Similarly, hiding times of striped plateau lizards, Sceloporus virgatus, in rockcrevices are shorter when a cricket is placed in front of the crevice openingwhere it can be seen by the lizard (Cooper 2009a[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.18]). Food addition also reduces hidingtimes in fiddler crabs, Uca mjoebergi, but only during periods when food isnaturally abundant and foraging is optimal (Reaney 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.81]). Food additions, however, have nonoticeable effect on hiding times of crabs when food levels are naturally lowand foraging efficiency is low, probably because the food added only has a weakeffect on the benefits of quick emergence after being attacked by a predator.Size of food items near the shell refuge of hermit crabs, Pagurus acadianus,does not affect hiding time (Scarratt & Godin 1992[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.85]). However, this is consistent withpredictions because all food items were larger than could be eaten entirely.Yellow-bellied marmots emerged sooner from refuges when supplemental food wasexperimentally placed next to their burrows than when food was absent (Blumstein& Pelletier 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.8]; Rhoades & Blumstein2007 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.82]). However, there is an intriguinginteraction; bold individuals that tolerate close approaches before hiding(i.e., with short FIDs) emerge sooner when food is present, while those that areshy and intolerant of approaching humans (i.e., with longer FIDs) take longer toemerge and, in contrast, emerge sooner when food is not present. The latterobservation does not apparently fit the expectations of refuge use models.However, it has been suggested (Cooper 2009a[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.18]) that this finding would be consistentwith theory if the placement of food by researchers before the trials in theexperimental treatment increased perceived risk more for shy than bold marmots.Another possibility is that individuals that escaped later were hungrier, whichwould explain why they delayed fleeing and had shorter hiding times. Bycontrast, those that had longer FIDs might not need the food as much at themoment of attack, but might consider it as a harvestable asset that would reduceforaging costs upon emergence, allowing longer hiding times than when food wasabsent.Optimality models predict that prey with greater initial fitness should havelonger hiding times (Cooper & Frederick 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.25]). This is based on the asset protectionprinciple (Clark 1994 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.15]) that predictsthat individuals with greater assets should protect them more carefully.Empirical evidence supports this expectation that prey state (i.e., initialfitness) affects hiding decisions. For example, hungry prey have shorter hidingtimes. This has been observed in barnacles, Balanus glandula (Dill & Gillett1991 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.34]), insects (water striders,Notonecta hoffmani: Sih 1992 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.86]; N.maculata: Martín & López 2004b [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.67]), lizards(Iberolacerta cyreni: Martín et al. 2003a[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.70]), birds (willow tits, Parus montanus:Koivula et al. 1995 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.51]), and in severalspecies of fish (minnows, Phoxinus phoxinus, and three-spined sticklebacks,Gasterosteus aculeatus: Krause et al. 2000a[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.54]; Metcalfe & Steele 2001[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.76]), but not in others (Dowling & Godin2002 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.36]). Another observation that supportsthis prediction is that prey animals with a lower body condition or that haveexperienced greater weight loss (i.e., that have lower fitness) have shorterhiding times (fish: Krause et al. 1998 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.53];lizards: Amo et al. 2007a [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.5], b[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.6]).Finally, even some plants might adjust for “foraging” cost of being hidden. Theplant Mimosa pudica displays a defensive behavior of rapidly folding its leaveswhen stimulated by touch, thereby decreasing visibility to herbivores, but atthe cost of reducing light acquisition and photosynthesis. The time that theseplants take to reopen leaves following a disturbance is longer under high lightconditions than under more light-limited conditions (Jensen et al. 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.48]). This suggests that this plant canbalance the risk and benefits of antiherbivore behavior in relation to currentenvironmental light conditions.9.3.2.2 LOSS OF REPRODUCTIVE OPPORTUNITIESThe loss of reproductive opportunities may also influence hiding times. Manyanimals are less responsive to predators during the reproductive seasons (Brown& Shine 2004 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.11]), and this response maydiffer between sexes. For example, during the mating season, male Iberian rocklizards have shorter hiding times than females at any time and than malesoutside of the breeding season (Martín et al. 2003b[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.71]). Furthermore, during the mating season,males have shorter hiding times when a tethered unfamiliar female (i.e., apotential mate) is experimentally placed nearby on their territories territory(Martín et al. 2003b [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.71]; Figure 9.7[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#FIGm-fig-64]). Moreover, in the absence of a female(control situation), males delay emergence when the approach speed of thesimulated predator is fast (i.e., high risk) than when it is slow (low risk),but hiding times do not differ between approach speeds or risk levels when afemale is present (Figure 9.7 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#FIGm-fig-64]).Therefore variation in hiding times seem to reflect different balances betweenthe costs of losing mating opportunities and the benefit of a reduction ofpredation risk over time.[OEBPS_Images_image00959.jpeg]Figure 9.7Effects of the loss of opportunities for reproduction on refuge use by rocklizards, Iberolacerta cyreni. Hiding times (mean + SE) in a refuge by malelizards in presence or absence (control) of a tethered female after beingapproached directly by an experimenter at one of two different approach speeds(slow vs. fast) in the mating season.(Redrawn from Martín et al. 2003b [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.71])Similarly, when mating opportunities for male fiddler crabs, Uca mjoebergi, areexperimentally increased by introducing a tethered female, actively courtingmales engage in highly risky behavior and re-emerge a few seconds after anattack, considerably sooner than males not presented with a female; some maleseven abandon refuge use completely if a female is present (Reaney 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.81]). This latter observation confirms theprediction from optimality models (Cooper & Frederick 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.25]) that prey may risk being killed byleaving the refuge if it may obtain reproductive benefits that are retainableafter death.Hiding time may also be reduced by recent interactions with conspecificcompetitors due to an increased perceived need to defend feeding or reproductiveopportunities, given that a hiding territorial resident is unable to monitor itsterritory or defend it from conspecific intrusions. The presence of an intruderin the near past can indicate an increased probability of future intrusions.Therefore following a conspecific intrusion, territorial residents shouldminimize costs from future intrusions at the cost of higher predation risks(Díaz-Uriarte 2001 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.32]). Thus when apredator attack occurs immediately after an agonistic conspecific interaction,foraging backswimmers, Notonecta maculata, hide underwater, but resume feedingpositions at the water surface more quickly and closer to the original positionfrom which they were disturbed, suggesting short-term defense of particularforaging positions (Martín & López 2004b[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.67]). When male lava lizards, Tropidurushispidus, have recently encountered a rival male, they emerge sooner after asimulated predator attack, presumably to avoid losing mating opportunities(Díaz-Uriarte 1999 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.31], 2001[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.32]). Similarly, territorial male waterskinks, Eulamprus heatwolei, are less likely than non-territorial floaters tohide in refuges and return faster to a basking site after an attack. This may beexplained by the trade-off that territorial lizards face between territorialdefense and antipredator behavior (Stapley & Keogh 2004[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.96]). Also, “singing” males of the acousticpyralid moth, Achroia grisella, within leks respond with shorter pauses in theirultrasonic mating call in response to bat sounds than solitary individuals(Brunel-Pons et al. 2011 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.12]).9.3.2.3 PHYSIOLOGICAL COSTSThe physiological costs of refuge use on hiding times should be influenced bytemperature (in ecotherms), and by oxygen concentration in the water (in aquaticanimals). In ectotherms, such as reptiles, the attainment and regulation of anoptimal body temperature is essential to maximize physiological and ecologicalprocesses, which may conflict with costs expected due to predation risk(Christian & Tracy 1981 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.14]; Huey 1982[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.45]). When a lizard or other ectothermicanimal hides in a cold refuge (e.g., a rock crevice), its body temperature willquickly fall below optimal values (Polo et al. 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.78]). This may affect general physiologicalperformance, such as somatic growth (Martín & López 1999b[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.62]; Amo et al. 2007a[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.5],b[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.6]), and may increase susceptibility topredators after emergence due to a reduced escape speed at low body temperatures(Christian & Tracy 1981 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.14]). Thereforehiding decisions of ectotherms should reflect the thermal costs of refuge use.Theoretical models predict, and empirical studies have shown, that as thedifference between temperatures inside cold refuges and outside environmentaltemperatures increases (i.e., when the physiological cost of refuge useincreases), hiding times decrease in rock lizards, Iberolacerta cyreni (Martín &López 1999a [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.61]; Polo et al. 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.78]; see Figures 9.1[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#FIGm-fig-58] and 9.2[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#FIGm-fig-59]), wall lizards, Podarcis muralis (Amo etal. 2003 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.2]), and striped plateau lizards,Sceloporus virgatus (Cooper & Wilson 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.26]; Cooper 2009a[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.18], 2011a[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.21]). A lizard’s body temperature thatbefore entering the refuge was correlated with the outside environmentaltemperature, will decrease more quickly and to a greater extent inside therefuge when the difference in ambient temperatures between the exterior and therefuge is greater. The empirical results suggest that optimization of refuge-usestrategies may help lizards to cope with changes in predation risk withoutincurring excessive physiological costs associated with a lowered bodytemperature.Predictions for the effect of difference between body and refuge temperatures inectotherms are similar in all models, and optimality models predict that hidingtimes should be strongly affected by the cooling rate inside the refuge (Cooperand Frederick 2007 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.25]). In lizards,ontogenetic changes in body size affect thermal exchange rates, with smallerindividuals having a lower thermal inertia (i.e., they heat and cool faster).This simple physical property may have consequences for thermoregulation, andalso for antipredator behavior. Therefore ontogenetic differences in thermalproperties might affect costs of refuge use. In comparison with large adults,smaller juvenile rock lizards, Iberolacerta cyreni, delay fleeing to a refugeand have shorter hiding times in cold refuges, probably because their costs ofhiding are higher, because they experience faster cooling rates than adults(Martín & López 2003b [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.65]).The effect of temperature on hiding decisions may be more complicated inectothermic animals because they may partially emergence to assess risk prior tocomplete emergence. In such cases, hiding time has two components. First,appearance time is the time between refuge entry and appearance of a preywithout fully emerging. Second, waiting time is the time between appearance andfull emergence.In Schreiber’s green lizards, Lacerta schreiberi, appearance time increases astemperature outside the refuge increases, body mass increases, and temperatureinside the refuge decreases (Martín & López 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.69]). Waiting time is longer whentemperature in the refuge is lower, but is not affected by exterior temperatureor body mass. Consequently, the total hiding time before complete emergence islonger when the exterior temperature is higher and the interior temperature islower. The results show that interior and exterior temperatures have oppositeeffects on appearance time, and that waiting time increases as interiortemperature decreases. The increase in appearance time as exterior temperatureand body mass increase are consistent with the hypothesis that lizards can spendlonger in refuge without suffering great loss of performance capacity when theirbody temperatures are higher and cooling rates are lower when they enterrefuges. Warmer lizards with slower cooling rates take longer to reach acritically low body temperature requiring partial emergence. The increase inappearance time as interior temperature decreases is opposite to previousfindings that hiding time increases as interior temperature increases.Because waiting time also increases as interior temperature decreases, hidingtime is longer when refuge temperature is lower and exterior temperature ishigher (Martín & López 2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.69]). If lizardsallow body temperature to fall lower before appearing at the refuge’s entrancewhen refuge temperature is lower, cooler lizards may require more time to assessrisk prior to full emergence. Furthermore, body temperature might increaseduring the waiting interval while lizards are partially emerged. This is morelikely if the lizards can bask, but also happens because the environmentaltemperature at the entrance may be higher than the temperature deeper in therefuge. The longer waiting times of lizards that enter cooler refuges mayaccount for the absence of any effect of body mass on hiding time despite theincrease in appearance time as body mass increases. Alternatively, lizardshaving greater thermal inertia take longer to cool, but also take longer towarm, which may lead to countervailing effects on appearance time and waitingtime. Although only interior temperature is significantly related to waitingtime, possible differences in body temperature upon emerging between smaller andlarger lizards could obscure a relationship between body mass and waiting time.Further research is needed to develop a comprehensive understanding of thesefindings. However, it is clear that when making decisions regarding refuge use,Lacerta schreiberi lizards seem to consider the physiological costs of being atlow temperatures and also the risk of emerging with low escape performance thatresults from low body temperature.In some cases, hiding in refuges may preclude breathing or make it difficult tobreathe. This too can increase the physiological costs of refuge use. Forexample, air-breathing dwarf gouramis fish, Colisa lalia, increase theirair-breathing frequency at low dissolved oxygen concentrations in water. Thesegouramis increase their use of refuges (submerged vegetation) and thus decreasetheir frequency of surfacing events to breathe air in the presence of predatoryfish (Wolf & Kramer 1987 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.99]). Thefreshwater clam, Corbicula fluminea, protects its soft tissues from smallpredators by closing its protective valves. This reduces predation risk, butventilation and oxygen uptake are suspended. Clams reopen their valves soonerwhen under lower than higher oxygen concentrations; a finding that suggests thathypoxia increases costs of refuge use and increases vulnerability to predation(Saloom & Duncan 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.84]). Mosquito pupae,Culex pipiens, get aerial oxygen by sticking their air siphons above water. Whenundisturbed, pupae rest at the surface, but react to physical and visualdisturbance by swimming down. The time interval between two consecutivesurfacing events (hiding time) is longer under high risk, suggesting, but notdemonstrating, a possible trade-off between risk and tolerance of oxygen deficit(Rodríguez-Prieto et al. 2006 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.83]).Nevertheless, time spent on the surface does not vary with risk levels.9.3.2.4 MULTIPLE TYPES OF PREDATORS AND CONFLICTING REFUGE USEA prey’s defenses against one predator may put it at greater risk of beingkilled by other predators. Some types of refuges may be useful only againstparticular types of predators or may expose prey to different predators (Sih etal. 1998 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.90]). For example, mortality ofmayfly larvae in the presence of both predaceous fish and stonefly larvae isgreater than expected because stoneflies in refuges cause mayflies to come outof hiding, thus increase their exposure to fish (Soluk 1993[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.93]).Prey exposed to multiple types of predators can experience conflicts. Enhancedsurvival from one predator may simultaneously increase vulnerability to anotherpredator, especially if prey can deploy defense against only one type ofpredator at a time (Sih et al. 1998 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.90]). Insuch cases, prey should use tactics to defend against the most dangerouspredator and ignore the less dangerous predators (McIntosh & Peckarsky 1999[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.74]; Bouwma & Hazlett 2001[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.10]). In many cases prey should decide touse a refuge against an exterior predator if the risk of being captured by thispredator is higher than the risk of being captured by another type of predatorinside the refuge.Wall lizards, Podarcis muralis, respond to simulated predatory attacks of birdsand mammals by hiding inside the nearest rock crevice, but this may expose themto increased risk of predation by the saurophagous smooth snake, Coronellaaustriaca, which ambushes lizards inside rock crevices. Thus wall lizards employdifferent alternative escape strategies in relation to their reliance on refugesafety (Amo et al. 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.4]). Lizards baskingclose to refuges that they have used recently, hide in them again when attacked.By contrast, lizards that are moving do not always enter the closest refuge, butoften run away without hiding. This behavior may be a strategy to avoid enteringrefuges in which the absence of predators has not been recently ascertained.Similarly, the gecko Oedura lesueurii uses the same types of refuges as one ofits main snake predators, Holocephalus bungaroides. These geckos use theirchemosensory ability to avoid entering rock crevices covered with the scent ofH. bungaroides (Downes & Shine 1998 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.37]).Log skinks, Pseudemoia entrecasteauxii, use snake-scented refuges less thanpredator-free refuges (Stapley 2004 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.95]).However, when skinks are exposed to risk of predation by a snake inside therefuge and by a bird in the open, skinks do not decrease their use ofsnake-scented refuges (Stapley 2004 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.95]),suggesting that predation by birds is more dangerous than the risk ofencountering a snake inside a refuge.Hiding time in refuges should depend on the probability that another type ofpotential predator is in the refuge. When a refuge is potentially unsafe (e.g.,because the prey detects predator cues inside), the probability of beingdetected by a second type of predator hidden in that refuge increased with timespent in the refuge. Hence, a prey hidden in an unsafe refuge will haveincreased costs of refuge use and should emerge sooner than from a predator-freerefuge. However, the presence of different predator cues may modify a prey’sreliance on refuge safety by altering its assessment of the risk associated withentering a refuge as well as the cost of remaining in one in relation to therisk outside the refuge. For example, after a simulated attack outside alaboratory refuge, wall lizards hid longer when there were no snake cues insidethan when chemical or visual snake cues were added to the refuge. Moreover, whenvisual and chemical snake cues were combined, hiding times were even shorter,supporting an additive effect of several cues to risk assessment (Amo et al.2004 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.3]).9.4 HIDING BEHAVIOR WHEN IN MORPHOLOGICAL AND CONSTRUCTED REFUGESMany animals flee to refuges, but are also able to escape by fleeing withouthiding, to choose the refuge type, and to change refuges after persistentattacks (Cooper 1998 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.16]; Martín & López1999a [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.61], 2003a[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.64]). Other species that are relativelysessile, such as polychaete tubeworms, caddis-fly larvae, mollusks, andbarnacles, can only take refuge in a protective structure surrounding theirbodies (Dill & Gillett 1991 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.34]; Johansson &Englund 1995 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.49]; Dill & Fraser 1997[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.33]). An intermediate situation occurs whenanimals have morphological or protective structures that provide partialprotection, but are also able to escape actively to safer refuges in theirhabitat. Examples are hermit crabs, hedgehogs, pangolins, porcupines,armadillos, some fishes, skin-armoured lizards (e.g., the armadillo girdledlizard, Cordylus cataphractus; horned lizards, Phrynosoma spp.) and turtles(McLean & Godin 1989 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.75]; Doncaster 1993[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.35]; Losos et al. 2002[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.60]; Mima et al. 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.77]; Martín et al. 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.72]). However, factors that modulate refugeuse in these animals remain largely unknown, and characteristics of such preycould complicate escape and hiding decisions predicted by optimal refuge usetheory (Martín & López 1999a [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.61]; Hugie 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.46]; Cooper & Frederick 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.25]).Hermit crabs, Pagurus filholi, have two antipredator tactics: taking refuge intheir shells and fleeing. When hermit crabs are dropped into seawater containingchemical stimuli from a predatory crab, they prefer hiding in shells of speciesthat provide more effective protection against crab predators, and hiding timesare shorter in the shells of mollusks where they are more vulnerable. However,hermit crabs have shorter hiding times in shells and switch to active fleeingearlier when predator stimuli are present than absent (Mima et al. 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.77]; Figure 9.8[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#FIGm-fig-65]).[OEBPS_Images_image00960.jpeg]Figure 9.8Hiding time before active fleeing by hermit crabs, Pagurus filholi, in theshells of Batillaria cumingi (heavy and highly protective) or Homalopomasangarense (light and vulnerable) after being dropped into seawater control orseawater containing (a) stimulus of a predatory crab or (b) stimulus of crushedconspecific.(Redrawn from Mima et al. 2003 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.77])Spanish terrapins, Mauremys leprosa, adjust their hiding behavior by assessingthe risk of emerging before the predator has left the area. Turtles hide longerin their shells when risk level is higher, as indicated by the predator’sbehavior (i.e., longer handling duration during the attack, proximity as theturtle hides, and persistence after the attack; Martín et al. 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.72]). However, because the shell offers onlypartial protection, increasing hiding time may also increase the risk that thepredator is able to injure or kill the turtle. Therefore the possibility ofswitching from hiding to active escape to a safer refuge (e.g., into water) alsoshortens hiding times.In turtles, interspecific differences in hiding behavior appear to be related tothe presence of different types of predators in different habitats (Martín etal. 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.72]; Polo-Cavia et al. 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.80]). After an attack by a terrestrialpredator, basking sliders, Trachemys scripta, remain hidden inside the shell forlong periods delaying or avoiding active escape toward the water (Polo-Cavia etal. 2008 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.80]). In contrast, basking Spanishterrapins, Mauremys leprosa, typically flee toward the safety of deep waterimmediately, remaining hidden in the shell only when they are far from water(Martín et al. 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.72]). Sliders hide inthe shell before entering water because diving may expose them to dangerousaquatic predators, but for M. leprosa fleeing to water immediately is favoredbecause aquatic predators are relatively uncommon in their habitat (Martín etal. 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.72]; Polo-Cavia et al. 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.80]).9.5 HIDING UNDER SIMULTANEOUS RISKS AND COSTSDuring an interaction with a predator, prey must simultaneously assess risks andcosts for multiple risk factors and several types of costs, and adjust hidingtime accordingly. For example, a prey might accurately assess risk level basedon predator behavior during the attack, increasing hiding time with increasingdirectness and approach speeds, but the prey has to simultaneously assess therisk posed by a predator waiting close to the refuge to avoid being capturedimmediately upon emergence. Conversely, if the prey assesses risk associatedwith the predator’s distance to the refuge, but fails to consider the predator’sapproach speed, it might be captured due to misjudging the predator’s speed.The “threat-sensitivity hypothesis” (Helfman 1989[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.43]) predicts that multiple risk factorshave additive effects on the intensity of antipredatory responses. This impliesthat all predator traits contribute to risk in an additive fashion andsimultaneous risks must therefore have additive effects (Smith & Belk 2001[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.92]). However, optimal refuge use theorysuggests that interaction between factors should be more common (Cooper &Frederick 2007 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.25]; Chapter 2[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#CN-bp-2]): additive effects are predicted to occuronly if the differences in curves of risk diminution with time for differentrisk levels of one risk factor are identical to those for the second riskfactor. Effects should be interactive when risk decreases faster with time forone factor than the other, which is a more likely situation given the differentcharacteristics and effects of each risk factor.A review of empirical studies examining effects of multiple risks and costs onFID and hiding time (Cooper 2009b [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.19])revealed far more frequent interactive than additive effects between two riskfactors, as predicted by optimality theory. For example, approach speed duringthe attack and predator proximity after the attack have additive effects onhiding times of rock lizards, but approach speed and directness interact withpredator persistence (Martín & López 2004a[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.66]), with place of emergence (Martín &López 1999a [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.61]), and with the peculiarcharacteristics of each individual predator (Cooper et al. 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.28]). Similarly, in wall lizards, directnessinteracts with proximity and with persistence of the predator (Martín & López2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.68]), and in Balearic lizards approachspeed interacts with both directness of approach and predator proximity (Cooperet al. 2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.30]) (see Figure 9.3[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#FIGm-fig-60]). In Spanish terrapins, risk level(handling duration) and proximity of the predator interacts with themicrohabitat where the attack occurs because hiding time inside the shellincreases with risk on land, but not in water where emergence could facilitatean alternative active escape (Martín et al. 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.72]).However, additive and interactive effects seem to be equally common when a riskand a cost factor are considered simultaneously (Cooper 2009b[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.19]). In this case, if there are unequalslopes of the risk curves for different risk levels, the cost curves fordifferent magnitudes of costs, or both, we could expect an interaction betweenrisks and costs. If curves for different levels of risks or costs have equalslopes, or differences are too small to be noted, we could expect additiveeffects. For example, risk due to lower escape ability after tail loss andthermal costs of refuge use have additive effects on hiding time in stripedplateau lizards (Cooper & Wilson 2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.27]).Thermal costs interact with directness and speed of the approach in lizards(Martín & López 1999a [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.61], 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.68]), but when there are persistent repeatedattacks of a predator, the effects are additive with thermal costs (Polo et al.2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.78]). More studies of diverse taxa arerequired to determine the shapes of risk and cost curves. These are needed byoptimality models of refuge use to predict joint effects of multiple risks andcosts.9.6 REPEATED ATTACKS AND MULTIPLE HIDING DECISIONS9.6.1 OPTIMAL MULTIPLE HIDING DECISIONSIn some circumstances, if predators remain waiting outside the refuge and trynew attacks or if predator density increases, a particular prey may suffersuccessive attacks in a short time. Successive attacks may be assessed asindicating increase in the risk of predation, but the costs of refuge use alsoincrease with time spent in the refuge. Thus prey should make new, but related,decisions on when to emerge after each attack. In a field experiment, rocklizards, Iberolacerta cyreni, were approached ten times in a short interval.Hiding times increased progressively with successive attacks, but only when thethermal cost of refuge use was low, as lizards tended to maintain or even todecrease hiding times between approaches when cost of refuge use increased(Martín & López 2001 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.63]).Polo et al. (2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.78]) modified previouseconomic models of hiding time to include the case of a high, sustained level ofpredation risk during repeated attacks. The model assumes that prey perceivethat the probability of a new attack decreases more slowly with time after eachsuccessive attack, that costs of refuge use increase with time at the same rateafter each attack, and that hiding cost does not start from zero except afterthe first attack, but accumulates across approaches and begins each time at themaximum level reached in the previous episode of hiding (Figure 9.9[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#FIGm-fig-66]). The model predicts that the optimalhiding time should increase following successive attacks and that this increaseshould not be linear but accelerating (i.e., the rate of increase in hiding timeincreases over successive emergences).[OEBPS_Images_image00961.jpeg]Figure 9.9An economic model to predict the hiding times of lizards in a refuge aftersuccessive continuous attacks as a function of the expected fitness effects ofthe diminution of the risk of predation in the exterior with time (PR) aftereach attack (successive PR curves), and variations with time in costs (C) ofrefuge use after each attack (successive C curves). The optimal hiding times(HT) after each successive attack are shown.(Redrawn from Polo et al. 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.78])In a laboratory experiment using male Iberian rock lizards, predation risk wasidentical in two treatments in which temperature inside the refuge was high orlow. As predicted, successive hiding times increased in an accelerating ratherthan linear manner and were shorter when thermal cost of refuge use was higher(Polo et al. 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.78]). This is similar toprevious field observations (Cooper 1998[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.16]; Martín & López 1999a[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.61], 2001[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.63]). However, in the laboratory, potentialconfounding variables were held constant and changes from low to high thermalcost were observed consistently in the same individuals.Assessed risk presumably was higher in the laboratory study (Polo et al. 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.78]) than in the field (Martín & López 2001[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.63]) because only one refuge was availablein a terrarium and persistent attacks were made from close range in thelaboratory, whereas multiple refuges were present and attacks were launched fromlonger distance in the field. Greater risk explains the increase in laboratoryhiding times even when thermal cost was high. Alternatively stated, whenpredation risk is very high, prey may adopt a conservative strategy and remaininactive in the refuge for very long periods and conserve energy (Polo et al.2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.78]). But this strategy is dependent ontemperature inside the refuge. When refuge temperature is low, lizards shouldinitially emerge as soon as possible to avoid heat loss. However, after repeatedattacks, it might be more favorable to remain inactive until risk decreasesbecause emerging with a low body temperature, and thus having poor locomotorperformance, may be more dangerous than risking starvation by remaining in theburrow. In contrast, in a refuge with a high temperature, where body temperaturedoes not decrease, prey can resume normal activity immediately after emerging(Polo et al. 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.78]).[OEBPS_Images_image00962.jpeg]Figure 9.10Multiple hiding decisions by rock lizards Iberolacerta cyreni. Successive hidingtimes in a refuge (mean ± SE) after multiple predatory attacks and under low orhigh thermal costs of refuge use.(Redrawn from Polo et al. 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.78])9.6.2 RISK ASSESSMENT AFFECTING MULTIPLE HIDING DECISIONSAlthough not responding to predator cues appropriately can be lethal, anexcessive or unnecessary hiding response also can have detrimental effects forprey (Rhoades & Blumstein 2007 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.82]). Thuswhen there are multiple persistent predatory attacks it is important todetermine whether prey use fixed behaviors or respond flexibly to short-termchanges in perceived predation risk by changing their hiding times.Prey might assess predation risk during successive attacks in several ways. (1)Fixed independent estimation: prey might estimate that each successive attack isindependent of the previous one and adjust hiding time to the current risk levelin each attack without considering previous risk estimates. (2) Accumulativedependent estimation: prey might consider that each successive attack representsan increase in risk level with respect to the previous estimation regardless ofthe actual risk level of each single attack. Thus successive hiding times wouldincrease. (3) Flexible dependent estimations: dynamic models have suggested thatanimals will show tolerance to imperfect information (Bouskila & Blumstein 1992[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.9]), but that the extent of this tolerancemay change from one situation to the next, and that the rules of thumb used toassess risk should be flexible enough to correspond to current conditions (Koops& Abrahams 1998 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.52]). After a secondsuccessive attack indicating predator persistence, it may be necessary to assessrisk more accurately. An individual might remember its estimate of the risklevel in one attack, compare it with the estimated risk in the current attack,and modify hiding time accordingly. If the second risk level is estimated to behigher than the previous one, prey might consider that it has underestimated theprevious risk level and increase hiding time more than expected. If the secondrisk level is estimated to be lower, then prey might consider that it hasoverestimated the first risk level and show shorter hiding times than expected.A more conservative option might be to maintain at least the response to therisk level estimated in the first attack, even if the second attack wasestimated to be of lower intensity. This could be a viable strategy becauseoverestimation of risk may have milder fitness consequences than underestimatingdanger (Bouskila & Blumstein 1992 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.9];Rhoades & Blumstein 2007 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.82]; but see Abrams1994 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.1]). Alternatively, in some cases, preymay habituate and reduce its antipredator responses to a potential predator thatceases to be regarded as dangerous after repeated non-threatening exposures toit (e.g., Hemmi & Merkle 2009 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.44]).In an experimental field study, Martín and López (2004a[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.66]) examined how short-term changes in risklevel of two successive attacks affect successive hiding times of rock lizards(Figure 9.11 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#FIGm-fig-68]). The lizards seem to useflexible dependent estimations of risk in each attack. They change the durationof their hiding times through successive attacks as a function of risk level ofeach attack, but previous estimations of risk are used to assess the new risklevel in a second attack. Thus when both attacks are of low intensity, hidingtimes are of similar short duration after both attacks. When risk increases fromthe first attack to the second, or both attacks are of high risk, lizardsincrease hiding times after the second attack. However, when risk level is highinitially but decreases for the second attack, lizards maintain the hiding timerequired for the risk level assessed in the first attack. This might seem toimply overestimation of risk, but the cost of ignoring persistent attack may behigher (Bouskila & Blumstein 1992 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.9]).[OEBPS_Images_image00963.jpeg]Figure 9.11Multiple hiding decisions by rock lizards, Iberolacerta cyreni. Successivehiding times in a refuge (mean ± SE) in four treatments in which two successivepredatory attacks were both of low risk level (L1L2), increasing in risk level(L1H2), decreasing in risk level (H1L2), or both of high risk level (H1H2).(Redrawn from Martín & López 2004a [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.66])In contrast, wall lizards, Podarcis muralis, seem to consider each of threesuccessive attacks to be independent. They adjust hiding time to current risk ineach attack without considering the risk levels in previous attacks (Martín &López 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.68]). This indicates that lizardsmay track short-term changes in risk level through time and modify their initialresponses when required. This might occur if lizards considered that a predatorshould usually not outwait the prey after an unsuccessful attack (Hugie 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.46]), but depart to look for other potentialprey, which is plausible because lizard density is very high in this population.For this species, two successive attacks are likely to come from differentindividual predators, in which case risk may be assessed again in each attackindependently of previous estimates.9.6.3 MONITORING FROM THE REFUGE TO DETERMINE HIDING TIMEMost studies of refuge use have analyzed situations in which information onpredator behavior is unavailable to hiding prey. In this case current risk ofbeing killed upon emergence can only be estimated by prey based on time elapsedsince the attack and characteristics of the attack (Sih 1992[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.86]; Martín & López 1999a[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.61]; Hugie 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.46]). In other cases, prey can monitorpredators from the refuge safely and use information gained to decide hidingtimes (Cooper 2008 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.17]; Polo et al. 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.79]). Nevertheless, monitoring predatorsfrom the refuge entails costs, such as revealing the refuge’s position to thepredator while scanning for the predator presence.When monitoring behavior is possible for lizards at, or partially outside, therefuge’s entry, hiding time, as noted previously, can be divided into appearancetime and waiting or monitoring time. These different times may be differentiallyaffected by risk and costs of refugia.For example, in response to series of simulated attacks (low vs. high risks),rock lizards, Iberoalcerta cyreni, have appearance times that do not differbetween risk levels, but have longer monitoring times after a single low-riskapproach of the predator than after a direct unsuccessful attack (Polo et al.2011 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.79]). This may occur because, if therehas not been a clear attack, uncertainty about future risk would be greater, andprey may need more time before leaving the refuge to ensure that a predator hasnot detected the lizard and that it is not lying in wait nearby. These resultssuggest that different levels of uncertainty about future risks, rather thanjust the previous risk level during the attack, seem to modulate monitoring timefrom the refuge and, thereby, total hiding times.9.6.4 LONG-TERM TEMPORAL PATTERNS OF RISK AFFECTING HIDING DECISIONSPrey in nature experience a broad range of temporal patterns of predation risk,and it is not entirely clear how prey respond to these variations (Lima &Bednekoff 1999 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.57]; Sih et al. 2000[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.91]). This is important because it has beenpredicted that antipredator behavior in situations with different levels ofpredation risk should vary with not just the immediate level of risk but alsowith the preceding temporal pattern of perceived risk (i.e., risk allocationhypothesis; sensu Lima & Bednekoff 1999[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.57]).Rock lizards, Iberolacerta cyreni, were subjected to a series of simulatedrepeated predatory attacks in the laboratory (24 attacks in a four-hour period)of different risk level (i.e., low vs. high), with similar overall numbers oflow-risk and high-risk attacks across a trial, but with three different temporalpatterns of presentation (i.e., a series of low-risk approaches and then aseries of high-risk attacks, or the opposite pattern, or successive attackswhere risk level changed randomly; Martín et al. 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.73]). Under predictable temporal patterns ofrisk (i.e., multiple attacks with the same risk level in the recent past)lizards show accurate antipredator responses to each of the successive attacks.However, when risk is random, individuals are not able to predict the level ofthe next predatory attack and adopt a conservative strategy with longer hidingtimes than required by the actual current risk level.On the other hand, hiding times may be shaped by natural selection or maternaleffects. These may act through long-term differences in exposure to predationbetween populations. For example, the first-generation of male crickets, Gryllusinteger, reared in the laboratory from field-caught mothers from ahigh-predation habitat hide longer when placed in a novel environment in thelaboratory than male crickets born from mothers from a low-predation habitat(Hedrick & Kortet 2006 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.42]).Thereforedifferences in behavior are due to either non-genetic environmental–maternaleffects or genetic effects. Similarly, Balearic lizards, Podarcis lilfordi, fromtwo islet populations with different predation pressure differ in hiding time(almost nine times longer under high predation pressure) (Cooper et al. 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.29]). And wild-caught guppies, Poeciliareticulata, from high-predation localities emerge sooner from shelter comparedto those from low-predation localities (Harris et al. 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.40]).9.7 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONSMany predictions from theoretical models of hiding time have been successfullytested using simply designed studies that measured hiding behavior, but manytopics require research in the future. First, the emphasis of available studiesis heavily on lizards. Studies of a wide range of different taxa, in differentenvironments and with different physiological and morphological constrains mayimpart more useful knowledge and help to assess the range of applicability ofthe predictions of theoretical models. Second, new, probably more elaborated andcomplex, models and experiments are needed to understand hiding behavior insituations when several risk and costs factors act simultaneously and whenmutliple responses depend of previous decisions. In addition, variation indecisions about refuge use may interact with other antipredatory behaviors, suchas FID and DF, and may also depend on differences in personality that are notconsidered in current models. Encounters with predators often involve multiple,complex successive chases and escape sequences. In such cases, prey shouldcontinously assess and track changes in risk level, consider potentialaccumulative costs of refuge use, and estimate the relative success of itsprevious antipredatory decisions to modify them accordingly. The ability tomonitor predators and quality of the information about predator behavior and“intentions” have been considered little. Although the waiting-game model (Hugie2003 [OEBPS_Text_part0022.xhtml#REFe-r-9.46]) predicts that hiding time islonger than a predator’s giving-up time, very little empirical attention hasbeen paid to understanding why predators should not be able to predict hidingtimes of their prey better (as human researchers seem to do) and counteracttheir antipredatory strategies. This points out the need for models and studiesthat consider the actions of both prey and predator behavior simultaneously. Newmodels and experiments using hiding time and related variables will lead to agreater understanding of many aspects of risk-taking decisions.REFERENCESAbrams, P. A. (1994).

However, prey species may exercise somecontrol over the timing of predator detection, which can free up time toevaluate the threat that the predator poses and even alter the outcome of theencounter with the predator (Caro 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.18]). The purpose of this chapter is toexamine factors that influence predator detection and the options available to aprey animal between the detection of a predator and escape.The ability to detect predators early in the predation sequence depends on theamount of time allocated to antipredator vigilance. Maintaining a vigilant stateallows prey animals to detect predators earlier but at a cost. Indeed, vigilanceoften conflicts with other fitness-enhancing activities, such as foraging andsleeping, and, generally, prey species must make a trade-off between theirvarious time demands (Caraco 1979 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.15]). Anyfactor that influences how much time individuals can allocate to antipredatorvigilance will have an impact on the distance at which a predator can bedetected on average. I shall review some of the major factors that affectvigilance, such as group size, and highlight some recent developments invigilance research with a direct bearing on escape behavior. In particular,vigilance may be expected to fluctuate through time within the same group,implying that the ability to detect predators may also vary on a short timescale.Prey species can manipulate the outcome of an encounter with a predator afterdetection. Many prey species produce alarm calls upon detection of a predator(Bradbury & Vehrencamp 2011 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.13]). Suchsignals may be aimed at the predator to indicate detection, but they oftentransfer information to nearby conspecifics. Recent work has shown that alarmcalls can convey information about predator size and distance and even behavior,which may be crucial to receivers in determining the best course of action asthe predator approaches (Zuberbühler 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.91]). Upon hearing an alarm call,individuals may flee immediately or assess the situation before initiatingflight. The second part of this chapter focuses on the properties of alarm callsand their effects on conspecifics.Signals produced after predator detection can also convey information to thepredator (Shelley & Blumstein 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.77]).Prey animals that are likely to escape following detection may signal to thepredator that it has been detected. In addition, they can signal their qualityto the predator. Predators may use information from these signals to abandonchases that would most likely be futile. The third part of this chapter examinesthe effects of signals produced by prey on their predators.Many prey species approach detected predators rather than flee (Pitcher et al.1986 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.68]; FitzGibbon 1994[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.32]). This counterintuitive tactic, whichbrings the prey closer to a potentially harmful predator, illustrates the notionthat prey are willing to take risk to gather information about the motivation ofa predator. Predator inspection behavior is common in fish and some mammals, andI close this chapter by evaluating the costs and benefits of this behavior.10.2 ANTIPREDATOR VIGILANCEIf prey animals were in predator detection mode at all times, the distance atwhich a predator would be detected would simply reflect the ability of the preyto extract threat signals from other non-predator related environmental stimuli,or noise. Basic predator detectability would vary among individuals, and fromspecies to species, reflecting sensory processing ability. In birds, forinstance, greater visual acuity associated with larger eyes allows earlierdetection (Fernández-Juricic et al. 2004[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.30]). Sensory processing ability wouldinteract with the degree of noise that characterizes the habitat to determinewhen an approaching predator first becomes detectable to the prey. For example,visual detection may be less effective in cluttered habitats (Devereux et al.2006 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.26]) and aural detection maydeteriorate in noisier settings (Quinn et al. 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.71]).This ideal scenario is unlikely to apply under most circumstances for at leasttwo reasons. First, rival sources of attention are almost always present in thelives of prey animals. Their attention may be diverted to monitor the activityof neighbors (Favreau et al. 2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.29]) orto fulfill other fitness-enhancing needs such as grooming, sleeping or foraging(Caraco 1979 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.15]). In fact, the ability todetect predators may be severely compromised when performing these activities.For instance, the senses of a sleeping prey animal are at best intermittentlyavailable, which may allow predators to approach undetected more easily (Lima etal. 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.50]). Animals also need to forage,and again the effectiveness of predator detection may be limited when resourceexploitation interferes with detection (Lima & Bednekoff 1999[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.49]; Kaby & Lind 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.41]). Second, the ability to detect stimulimay, paradoxically, decrease when vigilance for predation threats is maintainedfor too long a period of time due to habituation or fatigue (Dimond & Lazarus1974 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.27]). This physiological response mayentice prey animals to reduce to some extent the total amount of time allocatedto predator detection so as to maintain a high level of detectability. Thisdiscussion emphasizes that the time available to detect predators is most likelylimited.Overall, the distance at which a predator can be first detected will reflect theinterplay between sensory processing ability, the amount of environmental noise,and the time that can be devoted to predator detection. All else being equal,animals that invest less time in predator detection may be expected to detectpredators later on average. Any factor that influences the time devoted topredator detection, which is typically referred to as vigilance, is thus likelyto impact the ability to detect predators early. In the following, I exploresome attributes of vigilance and the role of several ecological andphysiological variables known to influence its expression in the context ofescape behavior.10.2.1 WHAT IS VIGILANCE?Vigilance is a state of alertness that allows the detection of relevant stimuli.It is practically measured using external expressions of alertness, such as whenan animal raises its head to scan the surroundings. Indeed, a posture with thehead up was used to define vigilance in the very first model of vigilance(Pulliam 1973 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.70]). The focus on headposition assumes that vigilance is mostly performed visually, but acousticvigilance may be a common feature in animals and need not be performed head up(Ridgway et al. 2006 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.74]). In this case, itmay be difficult to assess when an animal is vigilant.Two types of vigilance are generally distinguished: routine or induced vigilance(Blanchard & Fritz 2007 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.10]). Routinevigilance occurs during spare time while induced vigilance is viewed as a directreaction to an imminent predation threat. It is the investment in routinevigilance that matters in the context of predator detection. Induced vigilancewould occur after a threat is detected and allow animals to weigh their optionsbefore escaping.10.2.2 CAN DETECTION OF PREDATORS OCCUR WHEN NON-VIGILANT?Vigilance was initially viewed as being entirely incompatible with otheractivities such as foraging. This simple dichotomy made it very easy todetermine the amount of time spent vigilant by an individual. Theincompatibility assumption probably reflects the fact that early models ofvigilance focused on species of birds feeding with the head down, a posturethought to impair their ability to detect threats. However, recent research withbirds, and other species as well, implies that some level of vigilance may bemaintained during other activities. Some species of animals can be alert forpredators even when asleep (Rattenborg et al. 1999[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.72]). When foraging, animals with laterallyfacing eyes can monitor areas directly above them to some extent (Lima &Bednekoff 1999 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.49]; Fernández-Juricic etal. 2008 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.31]; Wallace et al. 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.88]). Many species can also monitor theirsurroundings while searching or handling food in a head-up posture (Kaby & Lind2003 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.41]; Fortin et al. 2004[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.34]).The fact that some level of vigilance may be maintained by non-overtly vigilantanimals suggests that predator detection is possible regardless of headposition. However, it appears that the ability to detect predators is weakerwhen the head is down. In an influential series of experiments, Lima andBednekoff aimed to determine the extent to which non-overtly vigilant animalscan detect a predator. When head up, dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis) candetect a fast approaching mounted hawk very rapidly. By contrast, birds withtheir head down detected the hawk less rapidly, suggesting a less than optimaldetection response (Lima & Bednekoff 1999[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.49]; Figure 10.1[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#FIGm-fig-69]). In a further experiment with the samespecies, individuals increased the duration of their scans to compensate for theaddition of visual barriers that prevented head-down vigilance (Bednekoff & Lima2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.8]), implying that these birds valuethe information they can acquire when non-overtly vigilant. At least in thisspecies, detection of predators is possible when non-overtly vigilant, butappears less than optimal. Whether this is the case in other species remains tobe established. Generally, it may not be obvious to determine when a predatorhas been detected.[OEBPS_Images_image00964.jpeg]Figure 10.1Dark-eyed juncos detect a mounted hawk more quickly when overtly vigilant withtheir head up rather than with their head down. The attack started 15 m awayfrom a feeding platform upon which targeted birds fed.(After Lima & Bednekoff 1999 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.49])10.2.3 THE EFFECT OF GROUP SIZE ON VIGILANCEAs long as the probability of predator detection is higher during overtvigilance, any factor that reduces time spent vigilant will reduce the abilityto detect threats. Vigilance can be influenced by many variables, but the effectof group size has attracted the most attention in the literature (Beauchamp 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.2]). Models of vigilance predict thatindividual investment in vigilance should decrease as group size increases fortwo main reasons (McNamara & Houston 1992[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.56]). First, as group size increases, moreeyes and ears become available to monitor the surroundings so that threats areless likely to go undetected. Once a threat is detected, the fright responses ofdetectors can warn the non-detectors rapidly, allowing all group members to fleerapidly. Second, the presence of several potential targets in a groupeffectively dilutes predation risk for each prey as long as the rate ofencounter with predators does not increase with group size and predators captureat most one individual per attack. In view of the decreased risk of capture in agroup, individuals can reduce their investment in vigilance. As long as thevigilance at the group level is high enough, individuals in larger groups shouldenjoy greater safety than when foraging alone or in small groups.Predator detection should thus typically occur sooner in larger groups, whichbenefit from the presence of many potential detectors. In a classic experiment,Kenward used a trained goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) to attack wood pigeons(Columba palumbus) in groups of varying sizes from a standard distance. As thenumber of pigeons increased in the group, individuals detected the predator at agreater distance, as predicted from the pooling of individual detection effort(Kenward 1978 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.42]). While this study onlyrelied on one trained predator, results along these lines have been obtained inother species (Caro 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.18]).Detection of threats will not necessarily always occur earlier in larger groups.What matters for detection is the level of vigilance maintained at the grouplevel, which is known as collective vigilance. Detection will occur sooner inlarger groups as long as collective vigilance increases with group size.However, as I explained earlier, individuals are expected to be less vigilant inlarger groups, implying that collective vigilance is unlikely to increaselinearly with group size. Moreover, the time freed by a reduction in vigilancebecomes available to increase fitness through other activities, such asforaging. Under some circumstances, the fitness gains that accrue from anincrease in foraging may allow individuals to sacrifice safety, leading to alower level of collective vigilance in large groups. Sacrifices in safety maymake sense in various situations, including when foragers have low energyreserves or exploit resources in rich food patches (McNamara & Houston 1992[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.56]). In such cases, detection abilitycould, theoretically, be lower in larger groups. Further research should allowus to determine whether the advantages in having more eyes and ears in a largergroup always translate into faster detection.10.2.4 TEMPORAL CHANGES IN VIGILANCETwo recent developments in vigilance research are especially relevant to escapebehavior. Collective vigilance is a key factor in determining the ability todetect predators early. These recent developments suggest that collectivevigilance may in fact fluctuate through time, which implies that the ability todetect predators may not be constant within the same group. Such fluctuationshave been related to two factors: vigilance copying and predation riskassessment.Temporal fluctuation in collective vigilance is predicted to occur whenindividuals copy the vigilance of one another (Beauchamp et al. 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.6]; Sirot & Touzalin 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.81]). To put matters into perspective,models of vigilance typically assume that vigilance should be independent amonggroup members. Sirot and Touzalin (2009[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.81]) suggested that individuals in a groupshould, instead, copy the vigilance of their neighbors under some circumstancesdetailed below. When copying occurs, collective vigilance will be less thanpredicted under independent vigilance because there will be more bouts thanexpected with few or no group members vigilant at the same time.Why would individuals copy the vigilance of their neighbors if it compromisesthe detection of predators? As I pointed out earlier, direct detection ofthreats allows a quicker escape. If predators preferentially target those thatescape more slowly, an individual should be more vigilant when its neighbors arevigilant to avoid being left behind when the group is attacked. Copyingvigilance is expected to produce rises and falls in the proportion of vigilantgroup members through time, temporal waves as it were. Copying vigilance hasbeen documented recently in many species of birds and mammals (Beauchamp 2009b[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.4]; Ge et al. 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.35]; Michelena & Deneubourg 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.57]; Öst & Tierala 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.63]; Pays et al. 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.66]), where it has been possible toeliminate the possibility that outside stimuli triggered synchronized vigilance.One study also provided evidence for temporal waves of vigilance in sleepinggulls (Beauchamp 2011 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.5]; Figure 10.2[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#FIGm-fig-70]). The implication for escape behaviorresearch is that the ability to detect predators may fluctuate on a short timescale within the same group.[OEBPS_Images_image00965.jpeg]Figure 10.2Collective temporal waves of sleeping, a low vigilant state, in two roostingflocks of gulls (Larus spp.). Time series analysis revealed a statisticallysignificant periodicity of 46 min in one flock of 72 gulls (dark squares) and of34 min in a flock of 150 gulls (gray squares).(After Beauchamp 2011 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.5])Copying vigilance should produce rises and falls in collective vigilance butabout the same mean. Recent models suggest that collective vigilance may also beexpected to decrease systematically with time since a group started to forage. Adecrease in individual vigilance with time may reflect the outcome of an armsrace between predators and prey (Beauchamp & Ruxton 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.7]). Prey species often have littleinformation about current predation risk in the food patches they visit. Inparticular, a group that arrives at a new patch must determine whether apredator lurks nearby – like a lion (Panthera leo) hiding in the bushes(Périquet et al. 2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.67]). The predatormust decide when to break cover, and the prey animals must choose the level ofvigilance to adopt as a function of time. If the hiding predator always brokecover at the same time, individuals in the group will be selected to beextra-vigilant until that very time. Predators should thus keep the groupguessing about attack time. However, waiting too long may not be desirable asgroup members may be more likely to detect the predator. Group members shouldalso keep the predator guessing about when vigilance will decrease to avoid thesituation in which the predator simply waits for vigilance to come down beforelaunching an attack. The predicted solution to this war of attrition betweenpredator and prey takes the following form: predators attack at unpredictabletimes but typically early and group members adopt a high vigilance early andthen switch unpredictably later to lower vigilance (Beauchamp & Ruxton 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.7]).Prey animals in groups do not always face observant predators, but still need toassess predation risk. As time goes by without an attack, individuals may feelsafer and progressively and adaptively lower their vigilance (Sirot & Pays 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.80]). The implication of these directionalchanges in vigilance is that the ability to detect predators may decrease asforaging progresses in the same group. Lack of control over time since a feedingbout started will thus generally increase the amount of noise in detectiondistance. In addition, predator detection distance is expected to decreasegradually during a feeding bout. Empirical studies with simulated attacks wouldbe useful to establish whether detection ability and escape behavior change attimes where the group is expected to be less vigilant, say, during a trough incollective vigilance or later in a feeding bout.10.2.5 OTHER FACTORS THAT AFFECT VIGILANCEMany factors other than group size are known to influence the allocation of timeto vigilance. All these factors will have an impact on the ability to detectthreats by reducing the time devoted to predator detection. Lack of control overthese factors can introduce additional variation among samples of detectiondistance.Habitat characteristics that influence the ability of escape, time of day, andfood availability are three examples of environmental factors that influencevigilance. The ability to escape may vary in certain habitats, due to thepresence of obstacles or because protective cover is further away (Lima 1992[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.47]), for instance, which should influencethe level of vigilance that prey animals adopt. Detection ability may thusincrease in habitats where the probability of escaping is slighter. Time of daycan influence vigilance through many means. Predation risk may vary throughoutthe day as some predators are more active at particular times of the day or moredifficult to detect due to poor light condition (Lima 1988[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.46]). When predation risk is perceived tobe higher, prey animals are expected to increase vigilance, which may allow themto detect predators sooner. Vigilance may also vary on a daily basis in responseto changing energy requirements (Pravosudov & Grubb 1998[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.69]). For instance, vigilance may increasefrom early morning to the afternoon as animals become more satiated.Samples of detection distances may often be taken from areas that differmarkedly in resource availability and quality. Food patch characteristics canalso influence vigilance levels, and thus indirectly detection distances(Beauchamp 2009a [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.3]). Models indicate thatwhen animals face time constraints or, in other words, when there is a tangiblerisk of starvation, the level of vigilance should decrease as the rate of foodintake increases (McNamara & Houston 1992[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.56]). As patches of higher qualitytypically allow foragers to obtain food more rapidly, vigilance is thus expectedto decrease with food density. In conclusion, several environmental factors areknown to influence vigilance and must be properly controlled, eitherstatistically or experimentally, to reduce the amount of noise in detectiondistance.10.3 ALARM CALLINGVigilance is an investment in time prior to predator detection. It increases thechances of detecting the predator before it is too late. The following sectionsfocus on what happens after predator detection but prior to the actual escape.After detection, prey animals often emit alarm calls or produce other signals.Here, I am concerned with signals aimed at conspecifics. In the followingsection, I shall deal with signals aimed at the predator.In view of the limited amount of time allocated to vigilance by each groupmember, few prey animals are expected to detect an approaching predator at thesame time. Nevertheless, the detection of a threat by a few spreads rapidlythroughout the group. Detectors provide indirect cues of detection tonon-detectors through their behavior (Lima 1995[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.48]). For instance, eastern gray kangaroos(Macropus giganteus) that have detected a snake stare intently at the predatorand this cue soon alerts the others in the group (Pays et al. 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.65]). A more active system to alertneighbors is the use of alarm calls, which can reach other group members rapidlyeven when they are not in direct visual contact. In the context of escapebehavior, the occurrence of alarm calls can change the costs and benefits of theoptions available to group members prior to fleeing, and thus affect the courseof action selected.10.3.1 ALARM CALLS CAN CONVEY INFORMATION ABOUT THE TYPE OF THREATAlarm calls can provide crucial information about the type of threat the groupfaces and eventually which reaction is the most appropriate. In a classic paper,Seyfarth et al. (1980 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.76]) showed thatdifferent types of predators elicited different alarm calls in free-livingvervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus). With the use of playbacks, the authorssubsequently demonstrated that vervet monkeys adapted their escape tactics tothe type of alarm calls broadcasted: climbing in a tree when they heard theplayback of an alarm call associated with a leopard (Panthera pardus), lookingdown when they heard the alarm call elicited by a snake, and running to coverand looking up when they heard the alarm call produced after spotting an eagle(Seyfarth et al. 1980 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.76]; Figure 10.3[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#FIGm-fig-71]). In other species, acoustic features ofalarm calls have been shown to convey information about predator size (Templetonet al. 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.84]), distance to the predator(Wilson & Evans 2012 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.89]), urgency torespond (Manser et al. 2002 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.54]), and evenpredator behavior (Griesser 2008 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.39]), allof which could allow signal receivers to better choose their escape tactics.[OEBPS_Images_image00966.jpeg]Figure 10.3Vervet monkeys respond differently to playbacks of alarm calls elicited by aleopard, an eagle, or a snake. The percentage of trials where at least oneindividual showed a given response for longer after than before the playback isshown for each type of predator (n = 19 for the leopard (white bars), 14 for theeagle (gray bars), and 19 for the snake (black bars)).(After Seyfarth et al. 1980 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.76])This degree of sophistication in alarm calling probably matches the variety ofescape tactics available to a species. A single kind of alarm call may besufficient to all types of predators when there is only one way to escape(Blumstein & Armitage 1997 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.11]), butdifferent alarm calls matched to a predator or a specific situation may bebeneficial when prey animals can respond to a threat in many different ways, asthe vervet example clearly illustrates.10.3.2 FALSE ALARM CALLSAlarm calls are notoriously unreliable. Indeed, a high percentage of all alarmcalls in many species are actually false alarms attributable to non-threateningstimuli (Cresswell et al. 2000 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.23];Blumstein et al. 2004 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.12]). Upon hearing analarm call, it would make sense for non-detectors to evaluate the potentialthreat by themselves rather than flee immediately.One way to reduce superfluous escapes is to adjust the strength of responses tothe number of alarm callers. When many individuals sound the alarm at the sametime, it is probably more likely that the threat is real. Supporting thishypothesis, yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventris) were found to be morevigilant after hearing two alarm callers at the same time rather than one(Blumstein et al. 2004 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.12]). In birds,flushes to safety by several individuals at the same time are also moreeffective in triggering responses by nearby companions than single flushes (Lima1995 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.48]; Cresswell et al. 2000[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.23]).In many species, alarm calls have been reported to be individually distinctive,which raises the possibility that signal receivers may respond differentlyaccording to the reliably of alarm callers. Indeed, some individuals may have ahigher ratio of false to real alarms due to their lack of experience or a lowerthreshold for responding to potentially threatening stimuli. This idea wastested by associating the individually distinct calls of some yellow-belliedmarmots to a real threat and others to harmless stimuli, varying the reliabilityof alarm callers (Blumstein et al. 2004[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.12]). Marmots discriminated among reliableand less reliable callers and spent more time investigating the source ofdisturbance following broadcasts of calls from the unreliable callers.10.3.3 ALARM CALLS AND ANTIPREDATOR PLOYSAlarm calls may signal an imminent threat to which immediate action is required.However, the threat may not always be urgent, and in this case alarm calling maybe useful to deploy antipredator tactics that will reduce the chances of asuccessful attack. Alarm calls in many species cause signal receivers to adoptcryptic behavior such as crouching, whose purpose appears to be to reduce thelikelihood of detection by the predator (Evans et al. 1993[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.28]). Long-distance alarm calls in onespecies of monkey, indicative of a distant threat, causes individuals to bunchtogether, increasing the effectiveness of factors such as collective detectionand risk dilution (Shultz et al. 2003 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.79]).Alarm calls often trigger an increase in vigilance in signal receivers thusincreasing the number of individuals actually monitoring the threat (Loughry &McDonough 1988 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.51]). Increased vigilancemay be useful to better assess a threat (perhaps reducing the rate of falsealarms) or to ready all group members for mass flight (see below).10.3.4 ALARM CALLS AND MASS FLIGHTBy warning other group members rapidly, alarm calls may play yet anotherfunction prior to escape. Rather than fleeing alone, an alarm caller caneffectively recruit all group members for mass flight (Owens & Goss-Custard 1976[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.64]; Sherman 1985[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.78]), potentially reducing the chances ofcapture through the confusion or selfish-herd effects.Confusion acts when the predator closes in on a group of prey and attempts tocapture a particular individual from a fleeing group. Reduced capture rate afterinitiating a chase is thought to reflect distraction of attention from thetargeted prey by the presence of several non-target companions (Neill & Cullen1974 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.62]; Landeau & Terborgh 1986[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.44]). Recent research suggests thatconfusion is a line of defense that works by exploiting the cognitivelimitations of the predator (Tosh et al. 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.86]). The empirical evidence that confusionplays a role during escape behavior following an alarm call is rather anecdotal(Leger et al. 1980 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.45]; Sherman 1985[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.78]). To be more convincing, we would needdata on the effect of prey density on predator success rate with the predictionthat capture rate should decrease when prey are closer to one another.The alarm caller could also benefit by seeking protection inside the group,effectively using other group members as a shield (Hamilton 1971[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.40]). To invoke the selfish-herd effect, weneed direct evidence that alarm callers select particular trajectories in spacethat would reduce their domain of danger when fleeing. It is interesting to notethat if an alarm caller chooses to flee, the range of options for signalreceivers becomes very limited. As Sherman (1985[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.78]) pointed out, a signal receiver thatfails to flee cannot benefit from the confusion or selfish-herd effects and mayalso provide a more inviting target to the predator.10.4 PURSUIT-DETERRENCE SIGNALSI explore signals made by prey animals upon detection of a predator focusingthis time on their potential effects on predators. As with alarm calling, thesesignals can change the value of the choices available to prey after detection.If the predator, say, abandons the chase after receiving the signal, the preyanimals may choose to maintain vigilance rather than flee.The logic of signaling to an approaching predator is simple: when an individualis quite likely to avoid capture, it makes sense for the individual to produce asignal to dissuade the predator from attacking. Capture may be unlikely if, forexample, the predator has been detected early and lost the element of surpriseor if the prey animal possesses attributes, such as speed, that make capturemore challenging. With such a signal, prey can avoid the energy and time costsof an actual escape while the predator avoids the costs of a most likely futilepursuit (Ruxton et al. 2004 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.75]). Suchsignals have been referred to as pursuit-deterrent signals. Pursuit-deterrencesignals come in two types: signals that advertise detection to the predator andthose that signal the condition of the signaler to the predator.10.4.1 PERCEPTION ADVERTISEMENTThis type of signal may be produced in two contexts. The most obvious one iswhen the predator is detected outside the typical range of attack distances.Beyond this range, the risk of capture is low and producing the signal does notreduce the ability to escape should the predator choose to attack. Other meansof dissuading the predator from attacking after detection include mobbing by theprey (Tan et al. 2012 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.83]) or hiding in arefuge, both of which significantly reduce the chances of capture. Examples ofdetection signals involve visual signals such as tail flagging in deer (Caro etal. 1995 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.19]) and ground squirrels (Barbour& Clark 2012 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.1]), tail wagging in lizards(Cooper 2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.22]), or auditory signals suchas long-distance calling in primates (Zuberbühler et al. 1997[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.92]).Perception advertisement signals may also be produced when the prey animalsstrongly suspect that a predator is present (Bergstrom & Lachmann 2001[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.9]). This mechanism involves parsinginformation from the environment and producing the signal when a threshold ofperceived risk has been crossed. These perception advertisement signals may thusbe made in the absence of a predator.The costs of a perception advertisement signal for the prey involve theproduction of the signal and the risk of inadvertently attracting the attentionof other predators. Producing the signal itself is probably inexpensive,certainly in comparison to avoiding the costs of a chase altogether. Signaling,especially by mistake, can be costly if it attracts the attention of undetectedpredators. This potential cost may not apply when predator density is low andwhen the risk of mistaking harmless stimuli as real is also low. From thepredator point of view, the benefits include the probability of capture during achase and the costs include the time and energy involved in the chase.Mathematical modeling reveals that a perception advertisement signal can beevolutionarily stable if the benefits of producing the signals exceed the costsfor the signaler and if the costs of chasing are high and the probability ofcapture is low for the predator (Bergstrom & Lachmann 2001[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.9]).While it is clear that both predator and prey can benefit from perceptionadvertisement signals, it is less clear what prevents prey from cheating.Indeed, prey animals could produce signals of detection more frequently thanneeded in the odd chance that a predator has approached undetected. However,this is not a stable solution in view of the time costs involved in theproduction of needless signals and the chances that the signal may attract theattention of other predators, thus increasing predation risk inadvertently.Nevertheless, pre-emptive perception signals may work if signals have a shortrange, which makes them unlikely to attract other predators, and if the signalis typically associated with honest detection (Murphy 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.61]).10.4.2 QUALITY ADVERTISEMENTIf the odds of capture after detecting the predator are high, it would seem atfirst ill-advised for the prey to take the time to produce a pursuit-deterrentsignal when it could flee instead and gain more ground on the predator.Individuals that have the ability to escape at closer distances may stillbenefit from producing such signals, effectively advertising their quality tothe predator. To evolve, such signals must be costly otherwise all individuals,those able to escape or not, will produce the signal making it useless (Grafen1990 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.38]). Honest signals may include thosethat are condition dependent. For example, the length or frequency or intensityof a signal may be indicative of the condition of the signaler, which wouldallow the predator to judge the quality of the prey. Mathematical modelingreveals that such signals can evolve as long as there is a close relationshipbetween features of the signal and condition of the prey, and that the risk ofcapture for signaling prey decreases as the condition of the signaler increases(Vega-Redondo & Hasson 1993 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.87]). Thesesignals are considered quality advertisement signals, and tend to be more costlythan the perception advertisement signals discussed above (Caro 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.18]).What prevents cheating in this signaling system is the relationship betweenspecific features of the signal and individual quality. A low-quality individualis simply unable to produce signals that would deceive the predator (Zahavi &Zahavi 1997 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.90]). Intriguingly, cheatingmay be preventable even if the relationship between signal features andindividual quality is rather weak. Consider a situation in which low- andhigh-quality individuals produce the same signal. If a low-quality individualfinds itself in a group with n – 1 high-quality companions, the low-qualityindividual will still have a 1/n chance of being targeted by a predator thatattacks any group member with the same probability. The risk of capture for thelow-quality individual is higher now because the predator has been allowed muchcloser during the display. In addition, the poor quality of the prey animal willhamper its escape. Cheating of this type may only be possible in very largegroups in which the risk of being targeted is much lower.While predators should give up quite readily after a perception advertisementsignal, there should be a close relationship between abandoning a hunt and somedefinable features of a quality advertisement signal. The difficulty is todistinguish between the two types of signals. It is not always obvious todetermine the costs of a signal, and, moreover, the quality of the prey may notbe easy to assess in the field. Stotting is a good case in point. When stotting,an animal jumps up in the air with all four legs held stiffly. The success rateof attacks by cheetahs (Acynonyx jubatus) on Thomson’s gazelles (Gazellathomsoni) decreases from 21 to 0% when the quarry stots (Caro 1986[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.16]). Stotting may signal to the predatorthat it has been detected, but may also signal the quality of the signaler. Thecrucial data on the relationship between stotting performance and condition ofthe prey species come from a study involving African wild dogs (Lacyon pictus),another predator of Thomson’s gazelles (FitzGibbon & Fanshawe 1988[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.33]). Indeed, African wild dogs were morelikely to chase gazelles that stotted at a lower rate (Figure 10.4[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#FIGm-fig-72]). After being targeted, gazelles thateventually escaped stotted longer during the chase than those that were captured(Figure 10.4 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#FIGm-fig-72]). Supporting the hypothesisthat stotting reveals the condition of the prey, stotting was more common duringthe wet season when body condition generally improves. In other species,stotting rate correlates positively with body condition (Caro 1994[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.17]).[OEBPS_Images_image00967.jpeg]Figure 10.4African wild dogs prefer to chase Thomson’s gazelles that stotted at a lowerrate on average (left panel). Error bars show one standard deviation. Gazellesthat stotted longer during the chase were less likely to be captured (rightpanel). The median and the 75th percentile are illustrated.(After FitzGibbon & Fanshawe 1988 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.33])10.4.3 EVOLUTION OF PURSUIT-DETERRENT SIGNALSSignals produced by a solitary animal after the detection of a predator, such asan alarm call, can only be aimed at the predator. By contrast, signals producedby animals living in groups may be aimed at companions as well as the predator.To distinguish between the two potential targets of such signals, it isnecessary to understand the context of signaling. If group-living animalsproduce such signals when they are alone, the predator is certainly a potentialtarget (Murphy 2006 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.60]) although this doesnot rule out that the signal may also be useful to warn companions.As signals that evolved in one context may be co-opted by another, the currenttarget of a signal may not reflect very well the selection pressures that led toits evolution in the first place. A good example of this comes from theevolution of white tails in rails, a clade of reclusive semi-aquatic birds(Stang & McRae 2009 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.82]). Rails flick theirtails when disturbed and this behavior is more common in species with whitetails, which contrast sharply with their overall dark plumage. This display maybe used to signal to the predator that it has been detected and/or to alertcompanions in social species. A phylogenetic reconstruction showed that railsliving in open habitats are more likely to have white tails. In addition, thetransition to open habitats tended to precede the evolution of white tails whilegregariousness evolved later in some lineages. This ordering of events indicatesthat white tails probably evolved as an antipredator signal needed in the morerisky open habitats, and any current use by conspecifics reflects a co-option ofthe signal for other purposes.10.5 PREDATOR INSPECTIONAfter detecting a predator, several options are available to prey animals ingroups. When an attack is imminent, the only option is to flee as soon aspossible. However, predators are not always in attack mode and, in this case, itmay pay foragers to assess the risk posed by the predator before initiatingflight. Predator inspection behavior appears to play just this purpose. Duringpredator inspection, a subset of individuals leave the group, approach thepredator, stop, and eventually return to the group. This behavior is best knownin schooling species of fish and mammalian herbivores (Magurran 1986[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.52]; FitzGibbon 1994[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.32]; Caro et al. 2004[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.20]). Predator inspection probably providesinformation about the location and motivation of the predator, which can bepassed along to companions in the group. Predator inspection may be helpful toidentify situations where the predator is uninterested in attack, which wouldallow prey to save the cost of increased vigilance and fleeing needlessly.10.5.1 WHY INSPECT PREDATORS?At first sight, predator inspection appears ill-advised. Why risk death byapproaching a potentially dangerous predator rather than simply hide in thesafety of the group? Early research showed that inspectors do assess the riskassociated with approaching a predator. In one fish species, predator inspectionwas indeed more likely in less threatening situations (e.g., immobile predator)and when many individuals joined the inspection party (Pitcher et al. 1986[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.68]). Fish also tend to avoid the cone ofattack of a predator during inspection by biasing their approach toward the tailrather than the head (Brown & Dreier 2002[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.14]). Similarly, Thomson’s gazelles aremore likely to approach a predator when in large groups and in a terrain thatreduces the probability of ambush. Nevertheless, predator inspection is riskierthan remaining behind in the group (FitzGibbon 1994[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.32]; Milinski et al. 1997[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.59]), suggesting that predator inspectionmust provide compensating benefits.One possibility is that predator inspection can actually reduce predation riskfor the inspectors. Indeed, guppies (Poecilia reticulata) that inspected apredator were less likely to be attacked and killed than those that remainedbehind (Godin & Davis 1995 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.36]; Figure 10.5[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#FIGm-fig-73]). Similar findings have been reported inEuropean minnows (Phoxinus phoxinus; Magurran 1990[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.53]) and Thomson’s gazelles (FitzGibbon1994 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.32]).[OEBPS_Images_image00968.jpeg]Figure 10.5Guppies that inspect a fish predator are attacked less often than those thatremain behind. Error bars show one standard deviation.(After Godin & Davis 1995 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.36])Predator inspection can reduce predation risk through many means. The approachof several inspectors may confuse the predator, which may then prefer to attackthose that remain behind (Curio 1978 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.25]).Inspection may signal to the predator that it has been detected and that anattack on them rather than on those left behind is most likely futile.Supporting the idea that inspection reduces the probability of attack, cheetahstended to move to a different area after having been approached by inspectingThomson’s gazelles. Finally, inspection may also be a signal of quality todiscourage the predator from attacking those that comes closest. Support for thequality advertisement hypothesis comes from the observation that largerthree-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and those in better conditionare more likely to approach predators (Külling & Milinski 1992[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.43]).Predator inspection is often performed in groups and appears relativelycontagious. In Thomson’s gazelles, for example, all members of a group typicallyapproach the predator and other groups nearby are also likely to join(FitzGibbon 1994 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.32]). Approaching ingroups certainly reduces the probability of attack for any individual groupmember through a simple dilution of risk. Risk dilution reduces the costs ofpredator inspection.10.5.2 PREFERENCES FOR PARTNERSIn the preceding section [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#B-sec-100], I showed thatindividuals can discriminate among alarm callers on the basis of theirreliability. Research on predator inspection behavior has also examined whetherthe choices of partners during approaches to a predator are similarly biased. Aspredator inspection involves risks, an individual that remains slightly behindduring predator inspection would gain all the benefits from the inspectionwithout incurring the risks. To avoid such cheating, it was proposed thatindividuals should seek partners that have proven reliable during previouspredator inspection bouts, a tit-for-tat like behavior (Milinski 1987[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.58]). Evidence from the laboratory and thefield suggests that fish can form strong ties with one another while foragingand during predator inspection, which suggests that reciprocity may be involvedin choosing partners for inspection (Croft et al. 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.24]). However, crucial evidence thatindividuals are less likely to carry out predator inspection with partners thathave defected in the past is generally lacking (Thomas et al. 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.85]). These issues suggest at the veryleast that group composition may influence the occurrence of predatorinspection.10.6 FUTURE DIRECTIONSThe amount of time between predator detection and escape is under the control ofthe prey animals to some extent and can be increased by allocating more time toantipredator vigilance. This period allows individuals to assess the threatposed by a predator and to communicate through signals with nearby conspecificsand the predator. The risks of being attacked and of escaping can be manipulatedby using signals after predator detection. In the following, I highlight somespecific challenges for future work on the topics covered in this chapter.Antipredator vigilance represents an option to increase the distance at whichpredators are detected on average. It is not an easy task to determine detectiondistance since vigilance serves many purposes and varies as a function ofseveral environmental variables. A greater understanding of the factors thatinfluence collective vigilance will be needed to make more precise predictions.Recent work also suggests that different individuals may vary consistently intheir vigilance (Carter et al. 2009 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.21];Mathot et al. 2011 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.55]). This finding fitswith the observation that animals can vary in the level of risk they areprepared to accept (Reale et al. 2007 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.73]).This raises the fascinating possibility that detection at the group level mayvary as a function of the phenotypic composition of the group, and thatdifferent individuals may be able to detect predators more quickly than others.Future work along these lines will probably challenge the assumption that allindividuals adopt the same vigilance in a group.The type of information conveyed by alarm calls has been studied intensely, butwe still know little about the costs and benefits of uttering alarm calls. It isusually thought that such signals reduce the personal safety of the callers, butthe evidence is limited at the moment (Caro 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.18]). Many of the mechanisms that may allowprey animals to escape following an alarm, such as the confusion andselfish-herd effects, remain to be demonstrated convincingly. Complicatingmatters, alarm calls may not only warn conspecifics but also act concomitantlyas a signal to the predator, making it difficult to disentangle the respectiveselection pressures. The information from alarm calls can also be used by nearbyindividuals from different species to mount effective antipredator responses(Goodale et al. 2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#REFe-r-10.37]), effectivelyincreasing the audience network for such calls. It will be interesting todetermine in the future what information members of different species canextract from alarm calls developed for members of one species, and whether suchcalls can influence the detection ability and escape behavior of other species.By contrast to other means of dissuading predators from attacking, such ascrypsis or aposematic signals, pursuit-deterrent signals are displayed on afacultative basis, which highlights the costs of using such signals at all timesand also makes it possible to show graded signals that are condition dependent.It would be interesting to investigate why a facultative tactic serves thepurposes of predator deterrence to a greater extent in some species.Predator inspection behavior can also be viewed as a pursuit-deterrent signal.If it serves as a detection signal, it is not clear why detection cannot besignaled from the confine of the group at a safe distance from the predator.Coming closer to the predator is risky, but in fish at least inspection behaviordeflects the costs to those behind. This situation would make sense ifinspection behavior is a quality advertisement signal. However, the costs andbenefits of predator inspection behavior are known to some extent in arelatively small number of species and general conclusions are difficult todraw.REFERENCESBarbour, M.

Higham, and Theodore GarlandJr.11.1 INTRODUCTIONAll animal behavior involves movement, and most behavior involves locomotion,i.e., the act of self-propulsion. Arguably, “Locomotion, movement through theenvironment, is the behavior that most dictates the morphology and physiology ofanimals” (Dickinson et al. 2000[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.52]). In other words, natural andsexual selection often act on locomotor performance abilities because they arecrucial to success in many behaviors, including avoiding or escaping frompredators. As Damon Runyon put it, “It may be that the race is not always to theswift nor the battle to the strong, but that is the way to bet” (Runyon 1992[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.164]). Or, as noted by Woakes andFoster (1991 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.203], back cover),“Exercise lies at the heart of the struggle for existence. The exerciseabilities of animals are constantly being refined by the relentless process ofnatural selection.” Motivated by this perspective, several artificial selectionexperiments have targeted aspects of locomotor behavior or performance (Feder etal. 2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.57]; Careau et al. 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.27]).The types of locomotion used while escaping from predators are highly diversebecause the animals themselves, both predators and prey, are diverse. Moreover,numerous ecological factors, including gross characteristics of the habitat(e.g., presence of trees, boulders, sand) and environmental characteristics(e.g., temperature, wind, shade) are highly variable. Locomotion and itsrelationships to such factors ultimately determine whether a potential preyindividual escapes from an encounter with a predator (Figure 11.1[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_000.xhtml#FIGm-fig-74]).[OEBPS_Images_image00969.jpeg]Figure 11.1Path diagram depicting hypothesized causal relations among various factors thataffect whether a prey is able to escape from a predator (see also Bulova 1994[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.25]). Note that “prey ability tofight,” “predator ability to subdue,” and “escape success” are beyond the scopeof this volume, and so are depicted in boxes with dotted borders and connectedby dotted arrows. Various physiological and psychological conditions (bottomleft) will affect the locomotor abilities of both prey and predator, and theseabilities are also affected by abiotic conditions, especially in ectothermicpoikilotherms. Prey locomotor abilities affect decisions about how far theystray from safe refuge and how closely they allow a detected predator toapproach (i.e., flight initiation distance [FID]). Both FID, distance fled (DF),and speed affect the probability that the predator intercepts the prey, as dothe locomotor abilities of both predator and prey. Once contact is made, therelative abilities of predator and prey to subdue or fight (or possibly startleor bluff) determine whether the prey is able to escape. Physical performanceabilities during the “tooth and claw” phase are also affected by physiologicaland psychological conditions. A number of other likely effects are depicted butnot discussed in this legend (see text). In addition, several important factorsare not depicted, including predator crypsis and prey ability to detectpredators, and prey crypsis and predator ability to detect prey, all of whichare affected by both characteristics intrinsic to the organisms (e.g.,coloration, visual acuity) and external conditions (e.g., wind, cloud cover,time of day; Bulova 1994 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.25]).Note also that predator detection abilities, locomotor abilities, and abilitiesto subdue could all affect how and when the prey reacts if the prey assess thisinformation prior to making the decision. Finally, absolute or relative bodysize of predator and prey can have pervasive effects on many elements withinthis network.Lizards have been the subject of many studies of both locomotion andantipredator behavior. They provide a rich source for studying the ecology,performance, and biomechanics of escaping, given the disparate ecomorphologicaladaptations that characterize many lizard groups (Pianka & Vitt 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.153]). For example, geckos andanoles have adhesive toepads that allow them to escape on vertical and eveninverted surfaces (Russell 1975[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.165]). Chameleons have prehensilefeet that allow them to grip thin branches during escape (Higham & Anderson 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.88]). In sandy desert habitats,several lizard species have convergently evolved toe fringes and/or webbed feetthat increase surface area (Carothers 1986[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.28]; Luke 1986[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.139]; Bauer & Russell 1991[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.10]). Basilisks have evolvedsimilar foot structures to allow them to run across water rather than sand.Flying lizards can glide using foldable “wings” constructed of skin stretchedacross their ribs. This remarkable phenotypic variation should be consideredwhen determining how, where, and when lizards might escape.Lizards are diverse and flee by various means, including running, jumping,climbing, gliding (McGuire 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.147]), swimming, and diving.Aside from fleeing, lizards have alternative ways to avoid or cope withpredators, such as crypsis, armor, fighting, blood-squirting, and venom (e.g.,John-Alder et al. 1986 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.126];Sherbrooke & Middendorf 2001[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.174]). As our experience ismainly with lizards, we focus on them in this chapter although most of theconcepts that impact locomotor performance and escape success are more broadlyapplicable to other terrestrial vertebrates. We will briefly discuss how suchconcepts as detection of predators, decisions that lizards must make, and flightinitiation distance relate to and are determined by locomotor performance(Figure 11.1 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_000.xhtml#FIGm-fig-74]), but our mainfocus is the morphological and physiological basis of performance limits in thecontext of escape success.[OEBPS_Images_image00970.jpeg]Figure 11.2Lizards exhibit a great diversity of escape behaviors, including burrowing,sand-swimming, jumping, running, swimming, diving, escaping into crevices,climbing, and even “flying.” Shown here are (clockwise from top left) afringe-toed lizard (Uma sp.), collared lizard (Crotaphytus collaris), tokaygecko (Gekko gecko; photo credit: Lee Grismer), venomous Gila monster (Helodermasuspectum; see John-Alder et al. 1986[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.126]), horned lizard aftersquirting blood from its orbital sinus (Phrynosoma sp.), sand lizard shimmyinginto sand (Meroles sp; photo credit: Clint E.

Temperature is a primaryfactor that appears to determine whether a lizard will fight or flee becauselocomotor performance is (up to a point) increased at warmer body temperatures(e.g., sprint speed: Herrel et al. 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.83]; endurance: Garland 1994[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.64]). Two species of agamidlizards living in open habitats where refuges are scarce attempt to flee whenwarm, but stand and fight when temperatures are cooler and sprint speed is tooslow to permit escape (Hertz et al. 1982[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.85]; see also Crowley &Pietruszka 1983 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.48]). Thephysiological basis for this temperature-dependent shift in antipredatorbehavior appears to center on the differences in temperature dependence of forceproduction in the locomotor and biting muscles of these lizards (Herrel et al.2007 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.83]). Although locomotormuscles generate peak force under a relatively narrow, warmer range oftemperatures, the adductor mandibulae externus superficialis posterior, one ofthe jaw muscles responsible for producing force during biting, is largelytemperature independent, generating near maximal forces over a wide range oftemperatures (Herrel et al. 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.83]).11.2.2 IMPACTS OF LOCOMOTOR PERFORMANCE ON FLIGHT INITIATION DISTANCEFleeing from predation has largely been understood through the framework ofmodels utilizing economic (cost–benefit) escape theory (Ydenberg & Dill 1986[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.204]; Cooper & Frederick 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.41], Chapter 2[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#CN-bp-2]). As described in Chapters 1[OEBPS_Text_part0009.xhtml#CN-bp-1] and 2 [OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#CN-bp-2],an animal detects a predator and then monitors the predator as it approaches,fleeing when the cost of remaining in place equals the cost of fleeing (Ydenberg& Dill 1986 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.204]) or the expectedpost-encounter Darwinian fitness is maximized (Cooper & Frederick 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.41]). The distance between thepredator and the prey when the animal initiates its escape is termed the flightinitiation distance (FID). Evading predation via locomotion involves complex,high-power movements, including jumping, accelerating, running, and evasivemaneuvers (Djawdan 1993 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.53]; Zehr& Sale 1994 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.208]; McElroy et al.2007 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.146]; Higham & Irschick 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.89]). Therefore, evadingpredators requires high power output from skeletal muscles while operatingwithin the biomechanical constraints that limit performance. Biomechanical andphysiological sources of variation in performance often affect FID in waysconsistent with escape theory. For example, individual lizards with cooler bodytemperatures escape more slowly relative to warmer counterparts (Cooper 2000[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.39]; Cooper & Frederick 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.41]; Herrel et al. 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.83]). To compensate for decreasedlocomotor capacity, cooler lizards increase FID, presumably to prevent theirpredators from overtaking them (Rand 1964[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.155]; Chapter 5[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#CN-bp-5]). Underlying increased FID and reducedlocomotor capacity at cooler temperatures is the sensitivity of muscle functionto temperature, reduced metabolic rate, and reduced enzymatic activity rate(Adams 1985 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.1]; Marsh & Bennett1986a [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.141], b[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.142]; Rome and Bennett 1990[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.163]; Fitts et al. 1991[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.58]; Dickinson et al. 2000[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.52]; Jayne & Daggy 2000[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.122]). For example, the frequencyof muscle contraction at which mechanical output is greatest, known as optimalcycling frequency, increases with temperature. However, increasing temperaturebeyond a certain range may ultimately reduce power output (reviewed in James2013 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.121]) and hence locomotorabilities. Thus the interaction between temperature and locomotor physiology canimpact not only escape performance, but also decisions about when to initiateescape behaviors.Variable habitats often contain physical structures that constrain escapebehavior and performance, and likely necessitate changes in locomotorkinematics, which could play an important role in determining FID. For example,increases in substrate rugosity or compliance likely constrain a lizard’sability to achieve maximal sprint speeds during escape, thus potentiallyincreasing its FID or requiring an altered trajectory to minimize encounterswith substrates that would reduce performance (Figure 11.3[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_000.xhtml#FIGm-fig-76]; Irschick & Losos 1999[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.117]; Tulli et al. 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.191]; Collins et al. 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.37]). Given that terrestrial andarboreal environments present a diversity of obstacles, lizards that use highlycomplex habitats likely have evolved mechanisms for achieving high performancedespite structural variability. For example, lizards, including Anoliscarolinensis, Callisaurus draconoides, Uma scoparia, and some species ofVaranus, alter limb posture and/or kinematics to deal with decreases in perchdiameter and/or increases in perch incline, and these kinematic changes affectdownstream changes in locomotor speed (Irschick & Jayne 1999[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.115]; Jayne & Irschick 1999[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.124]; Higham & Jayne 2004a[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.90], b[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.91]; Spezzano & Jayne 2004[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.184]; Foster & Higham 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.59]; Clemente 2013). Kinematicsalso play an important role in enhancing or constraining locomotor performanceduring escape because postural shifts may alter the ability of elastic tendonsto store energy and/or may dictate the operating lengths of muscles (Higham &Irschick 2013 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.89]). For example,different species of Anolis lizards have different levels of elastic energystorage prior to jumps because their femoral protraction differs (Vanhooydoncket al. 2006b [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.194], c[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.195]). Further, whereas Anolislizards decrease limb cycling rate to increase stability on narrow perches(Foster & Higham 2012 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.59]),Varanus lizards achieve both high sprint speeds and stability by increasingstride frequency (Marsh & Bennett 1986a[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.141], b[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.142]; Clemente 2013). Thishighlights the idea that there are likely multiple, context-dependent solutionsto predator evasion (Wainwright et al. 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.198]; Wainwright 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.197]; Bergmann et al. 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.15]; Garland et al. 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.70]). Hence, it is likely that astrong relationship exists between FID and the ability to make kinematic andbehavioral adjustments to compensate sufficiently for reduced performance.[OEBPS_Images_image00971.jpeg]Figure 11.3Schematic showing the variety of substrate textures or rugosities commonlyencountered by lizards. Substrates can be very smooth and/or compliant (e.g.,water [A], and sand [B]) or firm with varying degrees of roughness (e.g., treebark [C] and rock [D]). Many lizards have pedal specializations that assistlocomotion on these substrates: geckos have adhesive toe pads that are veryeffective at clinging to extremely smooth surfaces such as leaves and windows(although they cannot stick to Teflon), sand-dwelling lizards or juvenilebasilisks may have toe-fringes or webbed feet to increase surface area formoving on fluid surfaces, and claws help lizards move on rough surfaces.Changes in performance capability may underlie ontogenetic differences in FID inlizards. Smaller, younger individuals are slower (Garland 1985[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.62]), and thus may rely on eitherlonger FID or crypsis to survive. Conversely, adult lizards can increase FID tosave the energy that would be expended on a longer, faster run. Nevertheless,the patterns of FID, crypsis, and performance capabilities are nuanced andcontext specific; for example, in the absence of protective refuges, juvenilesflee more frequently than adults (Smith 1997[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.179]). Future studies shoulddetermine how selection acts on the integrated suites of acceleration, agility,sprint speed, and behavior to determine the true modus operandi of selection onlocomotion. Finally, to compensate for hypothetically lower performancecapabilities, juvenile lizards may use a greater percentage of their maximalsprinting and accelerating capabilities during escape than their adultcounterparts (Irschick 2000 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.112];Toro et al. 2003 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.188]; Stiller &McBrayer 2013 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.185]). Thisvariation suggests motivational differences may be key.11.3 MOTIVATION: HOW DO ANIMALS DECIDE WHAT TO DO?Motivation can strongly affect the performance exhibited by an individual in agiven locomotor event (Astley et al. 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.6]). Performance is defined asthe “ability of an individual to conduct a task when maximally motivated”(Careau & Garland 2012 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.26], p.546). We define the motivation of an animal as the sum of factors or conditionsthat (1) stimulate or arouse an animal to perform a given task and (2) determinethe level of persistence and vigor as it performs that task (modified from Beck1978 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.11]). Motivation in lizardshas been inferred from measures of speed, latency between stimulus and response,and the number of stimuli required to elicit a response (e.g., Sorci et al. 1995[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.183]; Skelton et al. 1996[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.178]). However, these indirectmeasures may not allow identification of the factor or stimulus that is mostimportant for motivating a lizard to run. Attempts to assess motivation in thefield under a variety of natural and ecologically relevant conditions would helpidentify the situations and motivating factors associated with high performance.Once a predator has been detected, the motivation of the prey is an integralfactor in deciding whether or not to flee and in the subsequent level oflocomotor performance during the escape attempt. Interpopulational differencesin sprint capacity and/or voluntary running speed have been found within speciesof Podarcis, Sceloporus, and Tropidurus: individuals in populations exposed togreater predation risk may have greater sprint speeds (Crowley 1985a[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.46], b[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.47]; Snell et al. 1988[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.180]; Van Damme et al. 1998[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.192]; but see Huey & Dunham 1987[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.102]; Huey et al. 1990[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.104]). However, many species oflizards do not use their maximum performance capacity when escaping from apredator (Hertz et al. 1988 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.86];Garland & Adolph 1991 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.66];Irschick & Losos 1998 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.116];Irschick & Garland 2001 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.114];Irschick 2003 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.113]; Irschick etal. 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.119]; Husak 2006b[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.106]; Husak & Fox 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.108]). This may be a function ofmotivational differences and may help to explain differences between maximumlocomotor performance measured in the laboratory and realized field performance(Bennett & Huey 1990 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.14]; Huey etal. 1990 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.104]; Irschick 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.113]; Irschick et al. 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.119]). Thus, in some cases,lizards may be more motivated to run away from a human “predator” in alaboratory setting than they are to run from a common natural predator in thewild.To be successful, prey must be able to effectively forage and attract mates. Theconflicting demands imposed by multitasking may contribute to a prey’s level ofmotivation when fleeing. Lizards may be reluctant to escape if theirphysiological state (e.g., gravidity, injury, tail loss, body size, time sincelast meal) or the abiotic conditions (e.g., habitat structure, temperature,humidity) are such that their locomotor performance capacity is diminished.Beyond these considerations, personality traits that dispose an animal to takegreater or lesser risks may contribute to motivation regarding types and levelsof performance during escape (Cooper 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.40]; Careau & Garland 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.26]). Unfortunately, intuitive,concrete experimental data supporting the impact of motivation on escapeperformance in ecologically relevant contexts are scarce.11.4 ESCAPE ABILITYThe potential level of performance a lizard reaches in a given escape attempt islimited by its ability at that time, which is affected by various morphologicaland physiological traits (Figure 11.4[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_000.xhtml#FIGm-fig-77]). All aspects of locomotorability are likely to be interrelated to some extent because each subcategory ofability is influenced by such factors as body size, limb lengths andproportions, muscle size and composition, innervation, neural control, andtendon characteristics (Garland 1993[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.63]; Garland & Losos 1994[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.69]; Christian & Garland 1996[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.32]; Higham & Irschick 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.89]; Figure 11.4[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_000.xhtml#FIGm-fig-77]). Many of these relationshipsmay cause trade-offs or constraints (Garland 2014[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.65]) on the development orevolution of locomotor abilities (Vanhooydonck et al. 2014[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.196]). Another source ofconstraint is the conflicting functions of animal phenotypes (Higham & Irschick2013 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.89]). This is the case forbreathing and running in some lizards, where hypaxial and epaxial muscles driveboth the movements of the ribs (for breathing) and of the body (for locomotion)(Carrier 1991 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.29]; Farmer &Carrier 2000a [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.55], b[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.56]; Brainerd & Owerkowicz 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.22]). The dual role of thesemuscles would appear to be one important factor that can limit the endurancecapacity of a lizard, and therefore its escape ability in some situations.[OEBPS_Images_image00972.jpeg]Figure 11.4Path diagram illustrating interrelationships among some of the phenotypic traitsthat affect locomotor performance abilities, three of which are depicted(acceleration, sprint speed, and running endurance).11.4.1 BODY SIZE AND SHAPEHow the evolution of morphological diversity relates to variation in animalperformance is a fundamental question in both functional and evolutionarybiology. This section will contextualize lizard morphological diversity inrelation to escape diversity and attempt to link form with function. Anoverarching perspective is that body size has pervasive influences because it(1) affects the mass an animal must move and (2) is often allometricallyassociated with form (e.g., leg length: Christian and Garland 1996[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.32]; but see McGuire 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.147]), thus having indirecteffects on anything that form affects. Therefore body size strongly impactslizard locomotor performance and escape behavior (Figure 11.5[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_000.xhtml#FIGm-fig-78]). Moreover, body size itselfoften shows complicated evolutionary patterns even within relatively uniformclades of squamates (e.g., McGuire 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.147]; Collar et al. 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.35]).[OEBPS_Images_image00973.jpeg]Figure 11.5Relationships between body size and several traits relevant to escapeperformance. (A) Snout-vent length vs. flight initiation distance across severallizard taxa from continental Australia, Europe, South America, North America,and Africa (data from Cooper et al. 2014[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.44]). (B) Body mass vs. sprintspeed (measured on a treadmill) among seven Cnemidophorus species (data fromBonine & Garland 1999 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.19]). (C)Body mass vs. acceleration (at 0.05 s) in the agamid lizard Stellio stellio(redrawn from Huey & Hertz 1984[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.103]). (D) Body mass vs.endurance (measured on a treadmill) in three groups of iguanian lizards (datafrom Garland 1994 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.64]).Hatchling and juvenile lizards are generally thought to be under relativelystrong selection owing to their small size and limited locomotor capacity(Wassersug & Sperry 1977 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.200];Carrier 1996 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.30]; Husak 2006a[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.105]). However, one advantagesmaller, younger lizards may have over adults is the ability to utilize a widerrange of habitat structures and to escape into smaller retreats. For example,unlike adults, juvenile basilisks (Basiliscus basiliscus) are able to escape byrunning over water surfaces because the smaller juvenile lizards can generategreater force relative to their body size (Glasheen & McMahon 1996[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.76]). Similarly, smaller Anolislizard individuals utilize a wider range of habitat structures than their largercounterparts (Irschick & Losos 1999[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.117]). How juveniles utilizeacceleration and agility throughout ontogeny may be of utmost importance,especially given the differential impact of slopes and habitat structure onsize. Although larger lizards can sprint and accelerate faster than smallercounterparts (Huey & Hertz 1984[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.103]), smaller lizards may havesmaller turning radii and thus outmaneuver larger predators, a prediction thatdeserves empirical testing.Regardless of the cause of size differences (ontogeny, phylogeny, sexualdimorphism, etc.), steep inclines significantly reduce sprint performance inlarge animals relative to smaller animals (Jayne & Irschick 2000[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.112]; Birn-Jeffery & Higham 2014[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.18]). For example, the stripedplateau lizard (Sceloporus virgatus) flees shorter distances upslope thanhorizontally or downslope (Cooper & Wilson 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.43]). If a larger animal were tochase the lizard upslope, it would have to expend more energy and would be at adisadvantage due to the greater work required to move its larger body uphill, ashas been shown in lizards, in both the laboratory and the field (Huey & Hertz1984 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.103]; Jayne & Irschick 2000[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.125]; Birn-Jeffery & Higham 2014[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.18]).Sexual differences in escape ability (e.g., sprint performance) are oftenattributed to the energetic costs of gravidity (Shine 2003a[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.175], b[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.176]). For example, increasedbody mass alone could cause gravid females to have reduced locomotor abilities(Garland 1985 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.62]; Garland & Else1987 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.66]). However, becausereduced locomotor performance likely decreases future opportunities forreproduction, compensating for gravidity-induced impairment would have obviousevolutionary significance (Arnold 1983[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.5]; Reznick 1985[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.160]; Brodie 1989[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.24]; Husak, 2006a[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.105], b[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.106]). When performance andescape differences cannot be attributed to size alone, lower-level physiologicaldifferences are often the answer (Shine 2003a[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.175], b[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.176]; Lailvaux 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.129]; Husak & Fox 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.109]). Females that are lessconspicuous than males can rely relatively more on crypsis compared to males tocompensate for lower sprinting capacities (Cooper et al. 1990[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.44]; Cooper & Vitt 1991[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.42]). In fact, whereas non-gravidfemale collared lizards (Crotaphytus collaris) compensate for reduced locomotorperformance by using a greater proportion their lab-tested sprint speed, gravidcollared lizards remain closer to refuges relative to non-gravid counterparts.Further, when they do escape, females may use a greater proportion of theirmaximum sprint capacity to achieve similar escape speeds in the field (Husak2006b [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.106], c[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.107]; Husak & Fox 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.109]). Interestingly, althoughmany studies have supported the hypothesis that gravidity temporarily constrainsescape capacity due to increased mass (Le Galliard et al. 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.132]), gravid green iguanas(Iguana iguana) increase mechanical power, peak forces, step duration, and limbswing speed to compensate for the greater mass (Scales & Butler 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.171]). Furthermore, differencesin escape ability and decisions may be attributed to conflicts between optimaltemperatures for eggs and optimal escape temperatures (Lailvaux et al. 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.129]). Finally, Irschick et al.(2003 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.118]) found that at leastone gecko, Hemidactylus garnotii, actually ran faster with an added loadequaling 2% of its body weight (although sprint speed decreased with furtherincreases in load). This non-linear effect suggests that there may be an optimalloading weight that may be related to gravidity. Future studies could compareoptimal vs. actual reproductive mass increases.The evolution of body shape is another important factor in determining escaperesponse and success. In many animals, stockiness constrains flexibility andthus limits the contribution of axial movements to locomotion (Brainerd & Patek1998 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.23]; Walker 2000[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.199]; Bergmann et al. 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.15]). Because many tetrapods,including lizards, rely on axial bending to increase stride length, and therebysprint speed and endurance, reduced flexibility of the axial skeletonhypothetically decreases locomotor performance (Reilly & Delancey 1997[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.158]; Reilly 1998[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.157]; Walker 2000[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.199]). Therefore, to evadepredators, lizards with relatively stocky bodies should exhibit morphologicaland behavioral compensations for this locomotor impairment. One clear example isthe evolution of stockiness in the genus Phrynosoma, which compensates forreduced locomotor capabilities with greater morphological investment in armor(horns) and crypsis, in addition to the unique ability to squirt blood from theorbital sinus (Sherbrooke & Middendorf 2001[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.174]). Conversely, cursorial sandlizards, such as the zebra-tailed lizard (Callisaurus draconoides), have evolvedslender bodies with longer legs and tails. Lizards at this end of the spectrumrely on high speeds to evade predators and do not possess armor as Phrynosomadoes (Figure 11.6A [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_000.xhtml#FIGm-fig-79]).Furthermore, the medial iliofibularis, a swing phase locomotor muscle, consistsprimarily of fast-twitch oxidative glycolytic fibers in Phrynosoma andfast-twitch glycolytic fibers in the cursorial sand lizards (Bonine & Garland1999 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.19]; Bonine et al. 2001[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.20], 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.21]). This trade-off indicatesthat stockier, armored lizards such as Phrynosoma rely more on slower,aerobically powered steady locomotion that is unrelated to predation pressure,rather than high-powered, anaerobic bursts (Figure 11.6B[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_000.xhtml#FIGm-fig-79]).[OEBPS_Images_image00974.jpeg]Figure 11.6Schematic illustrating the relationship between hindlimb to forelimb ratio andbody shape among lizards. (A) Rhoptropus afer is specialized for higher runningspeeds and has longer hindlimbs relative to forelimbs. (B) Phrynosoma cornutumexemplifies the short-limbed, stocky, and heavily armored phenotype that hasreduced mobility. (C) Arboreal Cnemaspis species, like many arboreal lizards,tend to have more equal forelimb and hindlimb lengths, reflecting the increasedpropulsive importance of the forelimbs when climbing, and slender bodies forgreater stability on narrower branches. (D) Scincus scincus has a hydrodynamic,slender body and short, relatively equal forelimbs and hindlimbs to facilitatesand-swimming.In constrast with the sand lizards, slender-bodied skinks and alligator lizardshave reduced limb lengths (John-Alder et al. 1986[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.126]; Bonine & Garland 1999[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.19]). Shorter legs and elongatebodies may allow easier navigation through leaf litter, in-ground burrows, andtall grasses. Escape into such microhabitats may confuse predators or preventthem from following (Jaksić & Núñez 1979[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.120]; Melville & Swain 2000[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.149]; Melville 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.148]). Although it is thoughtthis escape behavior enhances the probability of escape (Schall & Pianka 1980[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.172]), little is known aboutother axial or appendicular adaptations for increased turning andmaneuverability in lizards. Although turning generally decreases sprint speed insome lizards (Jayne & Ellis 1998[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.123]; Irschick & Jayne 1999[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.115]; but see Higham et al. 2001[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.94]), it is likely thatbehavioral and performance responses to turning (Howland 1974[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.100]) vary by species and habitattype. However, this remains to be explored.Another body shape modification for escaping in habitats that impose intensefunctional constraints is body flattening by some saxicolous lizards (Goodman2007 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.78], 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.79]; Revell et al. 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.159]; Goodman et al. 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.80]). Although some saxicolousspecies exhibit morphological specializations for highly rugose cliffs andskree, high-speed locomotion on vertical rock faces is difficult, so manysaxicolous species hide within narrow crevices to avoid or escape from predators(Revell et al. 2007 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.159]; Goodmanet al. 2008 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.80]; Tulli et al.2012 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.191]; Collins et al. 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.37]).11.4.2 LIMB AND MUSCLE MORPHOLOGYLimb length strongly impacts locomotor performance; lizards with longerhindlimbs and shorter forelimbs achieve greater sprint speeds and jump farther(e.g., Bonine & Garland 1999 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.19];Toro et al. 2004 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.189]) althoughthere may be additional advantages to longer limbs that are unrelated tolocomotor performance (Iraeta et al. 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.111]). However, longer limbs maynot always be optimal for effective escape from a predator. As discussed above,shorter limbs may be advantageous for maneuvering in confined spaces, such asburrows, because they may achieve faster cycling frequencies and are easier tomaneuver around obstructions. Shorter limbs may also be beneficial for stabilityon narrower surfaces. In Anolis, although shorter limbed species don’t runfaster on narrower surfaces than longer limbed species (Irschick & Losos 1999[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.117]), they may be more effectiveat escaping if shorter limbs reduce the tendency to fall. This dual requirementof speed and surefootedness in order to achieve effective escape in arborealsituations is illustrated in Sceloporus occidentalis, in which terrestrialpopulations with longer limbs run slower than shorter limbed arborealpopulations on narrow substrates (Figure 11.7[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_000.xhtml#FIGm-fig-80]; Sinervo & Losos 1991[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.177]).[OEBPS_Images_image00975.jpeg]Figure 11.7Impact of substrate diameter on (A) sprint speed and (B) surefootedness of fourpopulations (California [high and low elevation], Oregon, and Washington) of thewestern fence lizard, Sceloporus occidentalis, that are arboreal to varyingdegrees. The more arboreal populations sprint faster and are more stable onnarrowest perches compared to the more terrestrial populations.(Redrawn from Sinervo & Losos 1991[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.177])Differential elongation of limb segments may also affect locomotor performance.Elongation of distal limb segments relative to proximal segments is anindication of cursoriality (Coombs 1978[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.38]; Hildebrand 1985[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.99]) and the metatarsal:femurratio is correlated with maximal sprint speed in mammals (Garland & Janis 1993[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.68]). However, the effect ofdifferent relative limb segment lengths on lizard locomotor performance remainsunclear. Van Damme et al. (1998[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.192]) found a slightly longerfoot length in faster species, but this difference was unlikely to have causedthe two-fold increase in speed among the species examined (Aerts et al. 2000[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.2]). Similarly, contrary toexpectations, limb segment length, independent of total limb length, is notcorrelated with jumping performance in Anolis (Toro et al. 2004[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.189]). In bipedal lizards, thestory gets a little more interesting. In addition to longer tails, shorterforelimbs (especially the manus), and longer hindlimbs (except in some agamids),bipedal lizards either have disproportionately longer proximal hindlimb segments(in iguanids) or distal (pes) hindlimb segments (Snyder 1954[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.181], 1962[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.182]). However, although lizardsthat can run bipedally generally run faster than strictly quadrupedal lizards,these morphological differences may be a function of the different mechanics ofthe two types of gaits. Based on what we know about mammalian limb morphologyand segment ratios, we can hypothesize certain morphologies in lizardsspecialized for high sprint speeds vs. those with limbs specialized for greaterstrength (Figure 11.8A [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_000.xhtml#FIGm-fig-81]).However, more research into the impact of limb morphology and segment length onlizard locomotor performance is necessary to test these hypotheses.[OEBPS_Images_image00976.jpeg]Figure 11.8(A) Left: forelimb and hindlimb of Varanus sp., after Bellairs (1970[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.12]).

Muscles are complex and can vary inboth morphology and the mechanics of contraction, both of which can have aprofound impact on locomotor capacity (Loeb & Gans 1986[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.136]; Biewener 1998[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.16]; Lieber & Ward 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.135]). Here, we will brieflydiscuss how the morphological aspects of muscle may affect locomotorperformance. A discussion of relevant physiological aspects of muscle willfollow in section 11.4.4 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#B-sec-107].The force a muscle can generate is a function of its physiologicalcross-sectional area (PCSA) because with a greater PCSA, a greater number ofsarcomeres in parallel can contract simultaneously to contribute to force,assuming maximal stimulation (Haxton 1944[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.82]; Alexander 1977[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.3]; Sacks & Roy 1982[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.170]; Loeb & Gans 1986[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.136]; Zaaf et al. 1999[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.205]; Herzog 2000[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.87]; Allen et al. 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.4]; Lieber & Ward 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.135]). The length of musclefibers affects total mechanical power because with longer fibers, moresarcomeres can be arranged in series and greater changes in length (andtherefore increases in speed) are possible (Loeb & Gans 1986[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.136]; Gans & de Vree 1987[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.61]; Biewener 1998[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.16]; Biewener & Roberts 2000[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.17]; Allen et al. 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.4]; Lieber & Ward 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.135]). The placement of themuscle, i.e., the origin and insertion points of the muscle relative to thejoints across which the muscle acts, also can affect locomotor function. Whenthe distance between the joint and the line of action of the muscle is greater,the muscle has a greater moment arm, and this increases the mechanical advantageof the muscle such that less muscular force is required to generate movementabout the joint (Figure 11.8B [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_000.xhtml#FIGm-fig-81];Gans & de Vree 1987 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.61]; Richmond1998 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.161]; Rassier et al. 1999[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.156]; Zaaf et al. 1999[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.205]; Payne et al. 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.151]; Wilson & Lichtwark 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.202]). However, increasing themuscle’s moment arm has a negative impact on the angular displacement andvelocity that can be achieved about the joint because a given change in musclelength generates a smaller change in joint angle (Rassier et al. 1999[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.156]; Payne et al. 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.151]; Wilson & Lichtwark 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.202]). These relationships leadto a trade-off between force and velocity such that larger muscle moment armsresult in greater force, but lower velocity. Thus we would expect to see smallermoment arms in limbs that need to achieve high angular velocities, as might bebeneficial for increasing stride frequency, but larger moment arms in limbs thatare built for strength, as might be beneficial in climbing and burrowingspecies. Although these predictions may hold in small-scale comparisons (Zaaf etal. 1999 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.205]; Herrel et al. 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.84]), broad comparative studiesof muscle morphology (in the context of maximum performance) are lacking forlizards. Do lizards that sprint faster (and cycle their limbs faster) exhibitdecreased moment arms compared to those lizards that move slower when escaping?Such studies will likely be particularly important because they have thepotential to incorporate the ecologically relevant comparison of prey vs.predator morphology and performance."},{"pageContent":"11.4.3 ESCAPE PERFORMANCE AND TAIL AUTOTOMYMany lizards possess the ability to autotomize (sever) the tail during apredator–prey interaction. The lost tail can provide a meal for the predator. Ifneither the tail nor the body are captured (Bellairs & Bryant 1985[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.13]), the autotomized tail maymove dramatically, distracting the predator while the lizard flees (Higham &Russell 2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.92], 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.93]; Higham et al. 2013a[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.97], b[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.98]). Caudal autotomy oftenenables lizards to survive a predatory attack (e.g., Daniels et al. 1986[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.51]). In some circumstances, theautotomized tail itself evades the predator completely, allowing the lizard toreturn to the site of autotomy to ingest the lost tail, which contains fatreserves (Clark 1971 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.33]). Below,we discuss the impact of caudal autotomy on locomotor behaviors critical toescape success: running and jumping.Although the tail of lizards is critical for locomotor movements, such asrunning and jumping, losing a tail is beneficial enough to offset the costsassociated with modifications of locomotor movements. Running fast is an obviousmechanism for evading a predator, and the tail plays a significant role inlocomotor mechanics of terrestrial lizards. A question that has arisen multipletimes is whether running speed increases or decreases following autotomy. Skinksand iguanids exhibit a consistent decrease in running speed following autotomy,whereas geckos and lacertids are highly variable, with some geckos exhibiting adrastic increase (Daniels 1983[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.50]; McElroy & Bergmann 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.144]). Interestingly, lizardswith larger tails tend to exhibit a greater decrease in speed (McElroy &Bergmann 2013 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.144]).Jumping is important during escape for many lizards, especially those inarboreal habitats (Losos & Irschick 1996[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.137]; Higham et al. 2001[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.94]), and tails can be criticalfor maintaining in-air stability (Gillis et al. 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.72], 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.73]). Anolis lizards with intactoriginal tails took off and landed with approximately the same body angle. Incontrast, tailless anoles underwent significant posterior rotation, up to 90°between take-off and landing (Gillis et al. 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.72]). Further, although lizardsoften autotomize only a portion of the tail, there was no significant impact ofthe amount of tail lost on body rotation during jumping (Gillis et al. 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.73]). However, high variationwithin groups that had autotomized different amounts of the tail may haveobscured any effects of the proportion of the tail lost. Lizards that have losttheir tail exhibit behavioral shifts to compensate for decreased stability. Foranoles, this might mean occupying areas closer to the ground to avoid injurywhile jumping during an escape or avoiding jumping altogether. Whether suchchanges result in increased mortality and decreased fitness remains to betested.In most cases, the autotomized tail is not lost forever. The ability toregenerate the lost appendage is common, but it is not clear how the ability toescape is impacted by having a regenerated tail. The composition of theregenerated tail is quite different from the original, which suggests thatfunction may be altered (Gilbert et al. 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.71]; Russell et al. 2014[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.169]). It is likely that finecontrol of tail movements is compromised in the regenerated tail, leading todecreased stabilizing ability during jumping and/or running. Future work shouldexamine how the function of a regenerated tail during locomotion compares withthat of the original tail, but also how performance changes immediately afterautotomy and during the phase of regeneration. Given that regeneration can takemonths, locomotor performance may gradually recover over this period of time.However, it is also possible that performance does not recover at all.11.4.4 HOW MUSCLE PHYSIOLOGY IS RELATED TO ESCAPE ABILITYGiven that muscles actuate the movements of the limbs during escape, it isexpected that muscle physiology correlates with escape performance. Despitethis, few studies have linked muscle physiology with running speed in lizards(Gleeson & Harrison 1988 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.77];Higham et al. 2011a [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.95];Kohlsdorf & Navas 2012 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.128];Vanhooydonck et al. 2014 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.196]).Additional layers of complexity include a number of physiological andmorphological parameters that might be related to locomotor performance, as wellas the number of muscles that could be examined. For example, one could quantifythe relative proportion of a given fiber type (fast glycolytic [FG], slowoxidative [SO], and fast oxidative glycolytic [FOG]), enzymatic activity,cross-sectional area of the whole muscle, fiber cross-sectional area, mass,moment arm, and other subordinate traits. Both propulsive (stance phase) andrecovery (swing phase) muscles could be examined, and each may give a differentresult. Finally, the ecological context of the locomotor event might impact therelationship between muscle physiology and performance. For example, themorphological/physiological predictors of performance on a level surface differfrom those on a vertical surface in the Florida scrub lizard, Sceloporus woodi(Higham et al. 2011a [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.95]). Thediameter of FG fibers in the gastrocnemius was correlated with acceleration on alevel surface, whereas the percentage of FG fibers in the gastrocnemiuspredicted acceleration on a vertical surface.Sprinting fast is commonly associated with increased escape performance. Thismakes sense, given that faster speeds will potentially increase the distancebetween the prey and predator over a given period of time. Gleeson and Harrison(1988 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.77]) linked musclemorphology and physiology (iliofibularis, gastrocnemius, and caudofemoralis) tosprint speed in the desert iguana, Dipsosaurus dorsalis. They found that up to30% of the variation in sprint speed could be explained solely by variation infiber cross-sectional area; decreased area was associated with faster speeds. InTropidurus lizards, faster sprint speeds were associated with a higherproportion of FG fibers in the iliofibularis muscle (Kohlsdorf & Navas 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.128]). Although not testeddirectly, it appears that those phrynosomatid lizards that sprint faster alsoexhibit a greater proportion of FG fibers in the iliofibularis muscle (Bonine etal. 2001 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.20]). For example, thehorned lizards sprint slowly compared to other species of phrynosomatids, andthey exhibit the lowest percentage of FG fibers (Bonine et al. 2001[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.20]). Collectively, it appearsthat increases in the relative proportion of fast-twitch muscle, which is goodfor power generation, is associated with greater escape performance in lizards.A key consideration when attempting to quantify escape ability in relation tomuscle physiology is which aspect of performance to measure. Although sprintspeed is a common metric, and is likely important for escaping, accelerationmight be more important in some cases. Indeed, the ability to acceleratemaximally may be crucial for initially increasing distance from the predator,whereas maximum sprint speed is likely important for maintaining that distance.Muscle physiology may be linked to acceleration performance, as opposed tosprint speed, given the relatively higher demand that acceleration places on thelocomotor system. As noted above, this is true for Sceloporus woodi moving onlevel and inclined surfaces (Higham et al. 2011a[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.95]). Muscle mass-specific powerduring acceleration in Sceloporus woodi approaches the maximum power outputmeasured for lizard hindlimb muscles, 90 W kg−1 (McElroy & McBrayer 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.145]). Future work should teaseapart the relative importance of acceleration and maximum sprint speed indetermining the outcome of predator–prey interactions in lizards. In addition tosprint speed and acceleration, endurance capacity may play a critical role inescaping from predators. This type of performance is likely enhanced by having agreater proportion of SO muscle fibers, which are ideal for powering behaviorsrequiring endurance. We know very little about the links between endurance andescape success in lizards, so studying this would be a logical first step.Overall, the relationship between muscle and escape performance is incrediblycomplex, depending on the type of muscle measurement, the muscle being measured,the species being examined, the ecological context, and the performance variablebeing quantified. Future work that illuminates the key variables would propelour understanding of escape performance.11.5 OPPORTUNITY: ESCAPING IN DIFFERENT HABITATSHabitat structure and substrate characteristics can profoundly impact thesuccessful negotiation of an animal through its environment. In this section wediscuss the interesting challenges posed by sandy, arboreal and saxicolushabitats, and the potential consequences for escape performance.11.5.1 SANDY HABITATSAlthough sandy habitats are often considered relatively simple, they makephysical demands that impose selection on many psammophilous lizards. Twowell-studied challenges common to many deserts are substrate compliance andincline. Here, we will discuss the challenges and compensatory mechanismsrelated to substrate compliance, leaving discussion of the effects of inclinefor the following arboreal section.Compliant surfaces, such as sandy flats and dunes, dissipate greater amounts ofenergy than non-compliant surfaces such as rocks. Consequently, escaping oncompliant surfaces requires increased energy expenditure (Zamparo et al. 1992[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.206]; Lejeune et al. 1998[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.133]). One reason for this is thedecreased ability to employ elastic elements as energy-saving mechanisms becausethe greater compliance interferes with effective loading of structures such astendons. However, various adaptations, such as specialized externalmorphological features (e.g., toe fringes) and modified kinematics (e.g., footposture and movement) enable effective, high-speed locomotion on compliantsurfaces (Glasheen & McMahon 1996[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.76]; Hsieh & Lauder 2004[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.101]; Tulli et al. 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.190]; Li et al. 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.134]). Nonetheless, maximalspeeds and/or acceleration of lizards running on sand may be reduced as comparedwith the same species running on a surface that provides good traction and isless compliant (Carothers 1986[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.28]).Laterally projected, elongated toe fringes increase toe surface area, and thustraction, on substrates such as sand and water (Carothers 1986[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.28]; Luke 1986[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.139]). The benefits of toefringes were discovered through an experiment that demonstrated that ablatingtoe fringes reduced acceleration and sprint speed on sandy surfaces, but not onrigid surfaces (Carothers 1986[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.28]). Interestingly, whereas somelizards have toe fringes to increase surface area, secondarily terrestrialgeckos exhibit digit modifications that reduce surface area. Many arboreal andsaxicolous pad-bearing geckos achieve adhesion by increasing their subdigitalsurface area to form microscopic setae, which bond with surfaces through van derWaals interactions (Autumn & Peattie 2002[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.7]), but can become clogged withsand (Hansen & Autumn 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.81]).Thus secondarily terrestrial geckos have lost or reduced these adhesivestructures, which likely allows them to perform better on flat, sandy surfaces(Lamb & Bauer 2006 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.131]).When lizards traverse non-solid surfaces, their hindlimb kinematics and foot usechange to accommodate slipping and energy dissipation (Li et al. 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.134]). On solid surfaces thezebra-tailed lizard, Callisaurus draconoides, employs digitigrade foot postureand spring-mass mechanics, whereas on granular surfaces they use plantigradefoot posture and paddle-like foot rotation (Li et al. 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.134]). In addition to thesekinematic modifications, sand-swimming lizards can employ unusual locomotormechanisms to propel themselves beneath the sand surface. For example,high-speed x-ray cinematography of sand-swimming revealed that the sandfish(Scincus scincus) retracts its limbs to the sides of its body and propagates awave down its body through lateral undulation to propel itself through the sand(Maladen et al. 2009 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.140]). Thisstudy highlights the importance of integrating natural history, morphology, andbiomechanical techniques to understand how evolution has acted upon integratedsuites of locomotor traits.In special cases, lizards, such as the plumed basilisk (Basiliscus plumifrons),can escape across water, which is also a compliant surface. Much like runningacross soft sand, elastic energy storage capacity is compromised when escapingacross water since the foot actually breaches the water’s surface during thestance phase (Hsieh & Lauder 2004[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.101]). Thus the limb acts like apiston, doing work throughout the stride, which is in contrast with typicalterrestrial legged mechanics.11.5.2 ARBOREAL HABITATSThe arboreal habitat may be one of the more challenging habitats; it is oftenhighly heterogeneous in incline, perch diameter, clutter, and substrate textureand compliance. How many of these characteristics impact escape performanceand/or escape behavior is poorly understood. However, the impact on locomotorperformance has been identified for a few of these conditions.Climbing up inclines not only poses a challenge for stability, but it alsoincreases the cost of locomotion because a greater proportion of gravity acts toresist forward locomotion, leaving a smaller proportion of gravity to help holdthe animal against the surface (Taylor et al. 1972[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.186]; Cartmill 1985[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.31]; Farley & Emshwiller 1996[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.54]; Roberts et al. 1997[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.162]; Preuschoft 2002[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.154]; Daley & Biewener 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.49]; Autumn et al. 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.8]; Birn-Jeffery & Higham, 2014[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.18]). This leads to a decrease inlocomotor performance on steeper inclines. However, as discussed above, themagnitude of this decrease in performance is size dependent, permitting smalleranimals to use inclines to facilitate escape from larger predators (Taylor etal. 1972 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.186]; Irschick & Jayne1999 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.115]; Irschick 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.113]). One way to offset thechallenges of moving up an incline is to increase muscle mass-specific poweroutput. A recent examination of ten species of Anolis lizards found that theevolution toward a higher incidence of escaping upward (based on behavioralobservation) has been paralleled by the evolution toward higher mass-specificpower output (Vanhooydonck et al. 2006a[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.193]). It is important to notethat the degree of arboreality does not necessarily imply that a lizard willescape up an incline when confronted by a predator. In fact, some species ofAnolis will escape up (e.g., A. valencienni), whereas others will not (e.g., A.lineatopus; Vanhooydonck et al. 2006a[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.193]). Thus it is critical tomatch morphological and physiological measurements with natural behavior.Narrower perches cause a reduction in locomotor performance primarily throughtheir effects on stability. As substrate diameter decreases, so does the base ofsupport, since foot placement is constrained to positions closer to the midlineof the body. This increases the toppling moment about the perch, and thusdecreases stability because a greater proportion of gravitational force actstangentially to the perch surface (Cartmill 1985[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.31]; Preuschoft 2002[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.154]). The resulting decrease inlocomotor performance (Losos & Sinervo 1989[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.138]; Losos & Irschick 1996[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.137]; Vanhooydonck et al. 2006b[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.194]; but see Schmidt & Fischer2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.173]) presumably occursbecause stability must be increased via postural changes (Figure 11.7[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_000.xhtml#FIGm-fig-80]; Peterson 1984[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.152]; Higham & Jayne 2004b[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.91]; Foster & Higham 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.59]), which, in turn, may affectmuscle function (Foster & Higham 2014[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.59]). As with increases inincline, smaller animals may benefit from retreating to a narrow perch during anescape, since larger animals would suffer a larger decrease in stability for agiven perch diameter.Despite these challenges, the arboreal habitat may offer some advantages interms of refuge availability. The abundance of higher order branching andleaves, especially in the canopy, may obstruct locomotion by impeding limbmovement, but it may also help reduce detectability of the prey by the predator,thereby reducing both frequency of escape events and necessary distance fled(Irschick & Garland 2001 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.114];Irschick 2003 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.113]; Husak & Fox2006 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.108]). Further, obstructiondue to clutter may also be size dependent, with larger predators unable tonegotiate the barriers as effectively as smaller prey.Complex branching patterns may also restrict either escape trajectory or escapebehavior because a fleeing lizard will be forced to either execute sharp turnsor jump to bridge gaps. In Anolis, locomotor speed decreases with increasingturning angle, regardless of escape strategy, because prey must pause to arrangelimbs for jumping (Higham et al. 2001[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.94]). However, the magnitude ofthis decrease differs among species (Higham et al. 2001[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.94]).The effect of perch compliance on lizard locomotion has been largely neglected.Its effect on jump performance in Anolis carolinensis suggests that increasingperch compliance decreases both take-off velocity and jump distance and altersjump trajectory due to recoil (Gilman et al. 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.75]). This species preferentiallyselects more rigid perches as take-off points for jumping in the field (Gilman &Irschick 2013 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.74]). The effect ofperch compliance on other locomotor behaviors and in other lizard species isunknown.Finally, it is important to note that these challenges do not occur inisolation. Rather, fleeing lizards must encounter various combinations of thesefactors, some of which may have greater impacts on escape success than others.In some cases, the ability to rapidly alter locomotor behavior (through changesin kinematics) several times as various types of surfaces are encountered mightdetermine the outcome of a predator–prey interaction. This ability to modulatelocomotion, rather than the ability to move on any single perch, could besubject to strong selection. Although the relative importance of thesechallenges is poorly understood, Anolis lizards may select broader substrates,even if this requires sharper turning angles. This may reflect avoidance ofinstability caused by narrower surfaces to facilitate increased escape speeds(even if this reduces effective distance fled; Figure 11.7[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_000.xhtml#FIGm-fig-80]; Mattingly & Jayne 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.143]).11.5.3 SAXICOLOUS HABITATSMany of the physical constraints of climbing described for arboreal lizardsapply to saxicolous (rock-dwelling) lizards because steeply inclined surfacesare prevalent in rocky habitats. However, some rocky habitats also have theadditional challenges of unsteady surfaces with variable rugosity (Figure 11.3[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_000.xhtml#FIGm-fig-76]; Revell et al. 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.159] Goodman et al. 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.80]) that may lead to strongselection on locomotor morphology and performance (Taylor et al. 1972[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.186]; Farley & Emshwiller 1996[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.54]; Goodman et al. 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.80]; Collins et al. 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.37]). Interestingly, support forthis hypothesis is equivocal. For example, whereas Liolaemus lizards exhibit noapparent ecomorphological or performance associations related to habitat use,Collins et al. (2013 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.37]) foundthat saxicolous lizards, with longer tails, broader body shapes, and longerdistal limb elements were less sensitive to substrate rugosity than theirarboreal and psammophilous counterparts. Furthermore, in some lizards, saxicolyis tightly linked with increased jumping, clinging, and sprint performance(Goodman et al. 2008 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.80]). Theevolution of fast sprinting may be directly related to the distance an animalhas to run to escape predation, which may be comparatively greater in rockyhabitats than in other terrestrial habitats (Revell et al. 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.159]; Goodman 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.79]). Another possibility is thatexposure to predators might be greater when a lizard is on top of a rocksurface, as compared to being on an inclined branch of a tree (within clutter)or on the ground (with vegetation). However, conflicting hypotheses regardinghow lizards deal with rocky habitats suggest that the three-dimensionalstructure of rocks, and how they are used during escape (e.g., jumping from rockto rock vs. climbing), may determine the morphological “fit” to the environment.Biomechanical studies, combined with corresponding behavioral studies in thefield, would clarify how morphology is used under various circumstances.Clinging and adhering are important in saxicolous habitats. In general, lizardswith shorter, highly curved claws and short toes have a comparative clingingadvantage relative to other lizards (Zani 2000[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.207]). This is likely importantfor lizards that need to prevent detachment during predation attempts, though itdoes conflict with the need to attain high speeds or execute long jumps (Goodmanet al. 2007, 2008 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.80]; Collins etal. 2013 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.37]). The toe pad ofgeckos is a key innovation that allows geckos to climb on the vertical andinverted surfaces of rocks and trees through friction and van der Waalsinteractions (Russell 1975 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.165],1986 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.166]; Autumn & Peattie 2002[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.7]; Tian et al. 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.187]). Setae, themicro-structures comprising the toe pads, are hair-like structures ranging from20 to 110 micrometers in length. Setae are pushed into the substrate and loadedin tension, thereby creating the intermolecular bonds that allow them to adhere(Autumn et al. 2000 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.8]). Ifvariation in micro-rugosity is high, only a percentage of setae may be able toengage with the surface at any given time, yet no evidence of morphologicalspecialization for particular rugosities has been found. Instead, toe padsaccommodate adhesion on a wide variety of unpredictable and highly variablestructures (Russell & Johnson 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.167], 2014[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.168]). Collins et al. (2015[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.36]) found that the morphology ofthe adhesive structures varies depending on the incline of the habitat. Thosespecies that move on surfaces with relatively low inclines exhibit a reductionin the adhesive system.11.5.4 INTERMITTENT LOCOMOTION AND HABITAT STRUCTUREAs outlined above, habitat structure can profoundly impact escape behavior andperformance. During an escape, pausing can be beneficial for avoiding fatigueand enhancing endurance in lizards (Weinstein & Full 1999[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.201]), but can also bedetrimental if it allows the predator to approach closer. Inclines and branchingare two additional aspects of habitat structure that can increase intermittentlocomotion (Higham et al. 2001[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.94], 2011b[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.96]). On a vertical surface(compared to a level), Sceloporus woodi exhibits decreased running speeds,increased maximum acceleration, and increased pausing (Figure 11.9[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#FIGm-fig-82]; Higham et al. 2011b[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.96]). Thus it appears that eitherthe enhanced acceleration may offset the costs associated with pausing orpausing facilitates increased acceleration by giving the propulsive muscles achance to recover. With increasing turning angles, Anolis lizards pause morefrequently to orient themselves before jumping across a turn (Higham et al. 2001[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.94]), but these pauses may takevaluable time during escapes, increasing the likelihood of predation. Inaddition to these potential benefits of intermittent locomotion, pausing may bebeneficial for evaluating the continued need to escape, thus permitting anearlier return to activities such as foraging, courtship, and thermoregulation.Regardless, negotiating complex escape paths should be studied in greater detailbecause selection may act primarily on these demanding behaviors. We expect thatthere will be a trade-off between escaping into demanding areas of a habitat(steep inclines, narrow perches, areas with sharp turns, more compliant perches,etc.) and the ability to escape at high speeds, but we need to discover thecontext dependence of these strategies.[OEBPS_Images_image00977.jpeg]Figure 11.9The average maximum velocity (A), acceleration (B), and number of pauses (C) inSceloporus woodi moving along horizontal and vertical surfaces. Although theaverage acceleration was higher on the vertical surface compared to thehorizontal surface, the average velocity was lower because the number of pauseswas greater on the more energetically demanding vertical surface. However,greater acceleration in this condition may partially offset, and indeed may bepossible because of, the effects of frequent pausing.(Redrawn from Higham et al. 2011b[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.96])11.6 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONSThe extraordinary diversity of behavior, morphology, and ecology among lizardsmakes them an ideal system for addressing many questions in biology, includingthose related to escape behavior and performance. Nevertheless, a number offacets contributing to lizard escape performance remain poorly understood.Both temperature and motivation impact not only the decision of whether toescape, but the level of performance that is achieved during escape. To betterunderstand how motivation affects the common measures of locomotor performance,we must improve our understanding of how such factors as personality traits,conflicting priorities (e.g., foraging, mating, defending territories),physiological state, and abiotic conditions contribute to motivation inecologically relevant contexts (see also Careau & Garland 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.26]). Although a dauntingprospect, such studies have the potential to profoundly affect our understandingof organismal biology.Although performance measures may increase as motivation increases, the maximallevel of performance during escape is limited by the prey’s locomotor ability.Numerous morphological and physiological traits interact to determine locomotorperformance. Despite extensive research relating limb length and body size andshape to locomotor performance, there remains a paucity of data on the impact ofdifferences in relative limb segment lengths and muscle morphology andphysiology on locomotor capacity. Beyond this, however, it is essential that weestablish the ecological relevance of such performance measures as accelerationand maximum sprint speed in order to ensure we are correctly characterizing andpredicting the outcome of predator–prey interactions.The impacts of hormones on locomotion in non-human vertebrates have receivedsurprisingly little attention, despite their potential importance (O’Connor etal. 2011 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.150]; Careau & Garland2012 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.26]; Higham & Irschick 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.89]). Although circulating levelsof testosterone have been positively linked to increased performance in lizards(Husak et al. 2007 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.110]), fewsignificant impacts after experimentally elevating testosterone levels have beenfound. In the northern fence lizard, Sceloporus undulatus hyacinthinus, sprintspeed and burst stamina were greater in individuals with experimentally elevatedplasma testosterone (Klukowski et al. 1998[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.127]). However, testosteronesupplementation did not affect locomotor performance (burst distance andtreadmill endurance) in Aspidoscelis sexlineata (O’Connor et al. 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.150]), leading to additionalquestions rather than answers. The conflicting results in the literature arelikely a consequence of confounding factors associated with the experiments andnatural differences among species and among populations within species (Crowley1985a [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.46], b[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.47]; Garland & Adolph 1991[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.66]; Sinervo & Losos 1991[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.177]; Bulova 1994[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.25]; Snell et al. 1988[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.180]; Van Damme et al. 1998[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.192]; Iraeta et al. 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_001.xhtml#REFe-r-11.111]).Finally, lizards must interact with their habitat when escaping from predators.Thus the opportunities or challenges of aspects of substrates have the potentialto impact performance capacity, resulting in the realized level of performancethat the lizard achieves. However, the impact and relative importance of habitatcharacteristics on escape performance, rather than simply locomotor performance,is poorly understood. Biomechanical studies of ecologically relevant behaviorsand interactions in the field are becoming increasingly feasible and arenecessary to improve our understanding of escape performance in lizards.Escaping from predators involves an integrated suite of behavioral,physiological, and morphological phenotypes, all of which may experience varyinglevels of selection in the wild. In addition, escape behavior and performancecan be modulated depending on motivation. To fully understand when, how, and whylizards escape, future research should aim to integrate decision, motivation,ability, and opportunity. Only when we consider all of these categoriessimultaneously within a single lineage can we gain an appreciation for how theyinteract and interconnect to produce the observed escape performance andbehavior.REFERENCESAdams, B.

Tyrrell and Esteban Fernández-Juricic12.1 SENSORY SYSTEMS ARE AT THE CENTER OF PREDATOR–PREY INTERACTIONSDespite being on opposite sides of the arms race, predators and prey share acommon goal: detecting each other as early as possible. Early detection isimportant for prey so they can initiate their escape behavior and increase theirchances of survival. Early detection is also important for predators so they cantake advantage of the surprise factor and enhance the chances of prey capture.We can then expect selection pressures on the predator and prey sensory systemsto enhance the chances of mutual detection (Cronin 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.16]). For example, the sand cricketfiliform hairs, which detect air movements, are especially sensitive to thefrequencies and velocities that its predators produce (Magal et al. 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.51]).We review, from a mechanistic perspective, how sensory system configuration caninfluence antipredator behavior. For the sake of space, we focus on the visualsystem of vertebrate prey (see also the electronic supplementary material for adiscussion on other sensory modalities), but some of the fundamental ideas canbe extended to other sensory modalities (e.g., Phelps 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.58]). Within the visual system, severaldimensions have been implicated in the responses of prey to predators:configuration of the visual fields (the degree of visual coverage around theprey’s head), spatial visual resolution (visual acuity), temporal visualresolution (how fast the retina can process temporal changes in visual stimuli),the type and number of centers of acute vision in the retina (retinalspecialization), visual contrast (ability to resolve a stimulus against thebackground), motion detection, etc. We will discuss the role of many of thesevisual dimensions in affecting the decision-making of prey under the risk ofpredation. This approach will allow us to draw attention to some sensory aspectsthat behavioral ecologists tend to inadvertently omit when designing andinterpreting studies on antipredator behavior.12.2 STEPS INVOLVED IN PREDATOR–PREY INTERACTIONS FROM A SENSORY PERSPECTIVEBefore prey can escape from a predator, they must first use their sensorysystems to gather information about the presence of the predator as well as itsbehavior. Decisions to eventually escape are based on the trade-off betweenstaying in the patch to enhance foraging/breeding benefits and leaving to reducethe risks of mortality (Krause & Ruxton 2002[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.43]). Not all decisions are correct, asthey may lead to false alarms, where the detected stimulus is not a predator, orit is a predator that is not in a position to attack (i.e., the predator is nothunting, has not detected the prey, is attacking a different individual, or hasalready captured prey). Sensory systems are expected to be configured to work inconditions that would reduce the probability of false alarms, if false alarmsare costly (Beauchamp & Ruxton 2007 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.2]).Consequently, sensory systems can be particularly relevant in reducinguncertainty, and thus improve escape decisions, in the following key steps ofthe sequence of predator–prey interactions: scanning, detection, assessment ofrisk, alert, and finally fleeing to cover (Figure 12.1[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#FIGm-fig-83]).[OEBPS_Images_image00978.jpeg]Figure 12.1Sequence of events, from the perspective of prey, to avoid predation.12.2.1 SCANNINGFrom a theoretical perspective, scanning or vigilance behavior is a keyparameter in antipredator behavior models (reviewed in Beauchamp 2014[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.1]). An increase in scanning effort isexpected to raise the probability of predator detection (e.g., Lima 1987[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.47]), an assumption that has receivedempirical support (e.g., Cresswell et al. 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.14]). However, the sensory basis ofscanning behavior has been less studied (Fernández-Juricic et al. 2004[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.25]; Fernández-Juricic 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.23]).Old models (and some new ones) make the simplistic assumption, from a purelybehavioral perspective, that scanning is restricted to some body postures(Fernández-Juricic et al. 2004 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.25]). Morespecifically, animals can only scan when head-up, but not when head-downsearching for food or pecking (i.e., mutual exclusivity assumption). From asensory perspective, this assumption does not apply to those species withlaterally placed eyes (most vertebrates). The reason is because the large degreeof visual coverage (i.e., wide lateral visual fields) would allow vertebrateswith laterally placed eyes to engage in scanning behavior even when head down(e.g., Fernández-Juricic et al. 2008 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.26];Figure 12.2 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#FIGm-fig-84]). Even more compelling isthe fact that in some bird species, the center of acute vision in the retinaprojects laterally in head-down postures (Dolan & Fernández-Juricic 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.18]; Figure 12.2[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#FIGm-fig-84]). Actually, there is empirical evidencein at least three bird species that the probability of predator detection inhead-down body postures is not 0%, as assumed, but actually around 30% inpecking postures and 75% in food-searching postures (Lima & Bednekoff 1999[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.48]; Tisdale & Fernández-Juricic 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.65]).[OEBPS_Images_image00979.jpeg]Figure 12.2Retinal and visual field configuration. (a) Retinal topographic map showingchanges in retinal cell density (photoreceptors, ganglion cells) with isoclines.In this schematic representation, cell density increases from the retinalperiphery toward the center of the retina where the spot of highest cell densitylies (i.e., center of acute vision). The center of acute vision will providehigher visual resolution than the retinal periphery (see Figure 12.3[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#FIGm-fig-85] for an example). (b) Top-view schematicrepresentation of the visual field configuration of a bird. The binocular fieldrepresents the overlap of the lateral fields of the right and left eyes and theblind area at the rear of the head provides no visual input. The center of acutevision projects into the lateral fields but not into the binocular field. Alsoshown in grayscale are the changes in retinal cell density (photoreceptors,ganglion cells) around the visual field (darker values indicate higher celldensities).Some may argue that even though this sensory assumption is not realistic, it maybe valid enough for modeling purposes. However, model predictions can changesubstantially when this assumption is relaxed. For instance, the frequency ofdifferent group foraging strategies (producers, scroungers, opportunists)changes depending on the degree of visual coverage of a species(Fernández-Juricic et al. 2004 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.25]). Thisis relevant because there is substantial variation between species in visualcoverage (e.g., Martin 2014 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.53]). Overall,modeling with assumptions that do not reflect the sensory systems of studyspecies largely constrains our ability to develop predictions that can be testedempirically and makes our interpretations of the empirical results morechallenging.The mutual-exclusivity assumption has deeply shaped the way in which behavioralbiologists measure scanning behavior (Caro 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.10]). The most commonly recorded parametershave been (a) the rate at which an animal goes head-up from a head-down position(e.g., scanning rate), and (b) the duration of time (raw or proportional) theanimal stays in the head-up position (e.g., scan bout length). However, whilethe animal is head-up, it cannot gather information 360° around its head due tothe constraints imposed by its visual field configuration (i.e., blind area atthe rear of the head; Figure 12.2 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#FIGm-fig-84]). Forinstance, in some studies comparing two species, the one with a wider blind areaallocated more time to head-up scanning (Guillemain et al. 2002[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.31]; Tisdale & Fernández-Juricic 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.65]) likely to compensate for the lowerdetection ability at the back of its head (Kaby & Lind 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.40]; Devereux et al. 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.17]). A new scanning metric has beenproposed, head movement rate, which is more sensory based because it capturesthe process of using vision for information gathering while head-up,particularly in species with laterally-placed eyes (Jones et al. 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.39]; Fernández-Juricic et al. 2011a[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.27]; Fernández-Juricic 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.23]). To better interpret the variation inhead-movement behavior, we need to understand some basic properties of thevertebrate eye.From a visual perspective, scanning while head-up (i.e., through head movements)is similar to a visual search task that involves searching for an object ofinterest (a predator) in the visual background when that object is notdetectable (Land 1999 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.44]). Visual searchis akin to taking a sequence of snapshots (one per each head or eye position)around the head with each retina. Every snapshot, however, is not like a regularpicture with high definition throughout it (Figure 12.3[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#FIGm-fig-85]). The retina is configured in such a waythat there is usually (at least) one area of acute vision (e.g., a fovea)surrounded by areas that provide less acute vision (the retinal periphery;Figure 12.2 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#FIGm-fig-84]). The center of acute visiongenerally has a high density of cones (which work under daylight conditions) anda low density of rods (which work at night) (McIlwain 1996[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.54]). The periphery of the retina usuallyhas the reversed pattern of cone vs. rod photoreceptor density. Cones and rodstransfer the information from the retina to the visual centers of the brainthrough the retinal ganglion cells, whose nuclei are part of the retina andwhose axons form the optic nerve (McIlwain 1996[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.54]).[OEBPS_Images_image00980.jpeg]Figure 12.3Schematic representation of how changes in head position vary the spatialposition of the projection of the retinal center of acute vision for rightlateral visual field. The center of acute vision provides high-quality visualinformation, but the retinal periphery provides lower quality information due tovariations in the cell density (photoreceptors, ganglion cells) across theretina (see Figure 12.2 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#FIGm-fig-84]).In general, the relative size of the retinal center of acute vision is muchsmaller than the rest of the retina (Figure 12.2[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#FIGm-fig-84]). This means that at each snapshotobtained by the retina, a small proportion of the visual space is at highresolution, but most of it is at low resolution (Figure 12.3[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#FIGm-fig-85]). The behavioral implication is thatanimals need to move the retinas around to get a sufficient number of snapshotswith high visual resolution per unit time to cover the visual space around theirheads (Figure 12.3 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#FIGm-fig-85]). The retinas aremoved around through eye and/or head movements. In general, head-movement ratesincrease when the perceived risk of predation increases, likely to visuallysearch more actively for the position of the potential threat (Fernández-Juricicet al. 2011a [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.27]; Randolet et al. 2014[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.60]).Recent studies have suggested that variation in the density of photoreceptorsand retinal ganglion cells from the retinal periphery to the retinal center ofacute vision (Figure 12.2 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#FIGm-fig-84]) couldinfluence scanning behavior (Dolan & Fernández-Juricic 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.18]). These changes in cell density acrossthe retina are known as cell density profiles, and can take different shapes(Figure 12.4 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#FIGm-fig-86]). For instance, a steepchange in cell density (Figure 12.2a [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#FIGm-fig-84])would make individuals rely mostly on their retinal center of acute vision(rather than the periphery) to gather information, which could increase the rateof eye/head movements to gather sufficient high-quality visual information perunit time. On the other hand, a shallow change in cell density (Figure 12.2b[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#FIGm-fig-84]) would allow individuals to rely notonly on their center of acute vision, but also partly on the retinal periphery,providing a larger proportion of retina with high-quality visual information,thereby reducing the rate of eye/head movements. For instance, Californiatowhees Melozone crissalis, with relatively steeper cell density profiles, havebeen shown to have higher head movement rates than white-crowned sparrowsZonotrichia leucophrys, which have relatively shallower cell density profiles(Fernández-Juricic et al. 2011b [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.28]). Thistype of variation in retinal configuration could have implications for head-upscanning and hence predator detection. For instance, if a species with a steepretinal cell density profile reduces its eye/head movement rate, it coulddecrease the chances of predator detection because of the fewer retinalsnapshots collected per unit time and the smaller retinal area with high visualresolution within each snapshot (Fernández-Juricic 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.23]; Figure 12.3[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#FIGm-fig-85]).[OEBPS_Images_image00981.jpeg]Figure 12.4Schematic representation of cell density profiles across the retina (i.e.,photoreceptors/ganglion cells). (a) Steep cell-density profiles have high peakcell densities within the center of acute vision, but decrease rapidly towardthe retinal periphery. At a given eye size, steep cell-density profiles areexpected to provide high visual resolution in a small retinal area, but lowerresolution in the periphery. (b) Shallow cell-density profiles generally haverelatively lower peak cell densities within the center of acute vision, but celldensities decrease slowly toward the retinal periphery. At a given eye size,shallow cell-density profiles are expected to provide high visual resolutionover a relatively larger retinal area, with a comparatively lower change invisual resolution from the periphery to the center of acute vision.12.2.2 DETECTIONThe sensory capabilities of an animal are likely to influence three aspects ofpredator detection: (1) the probability of early predator detection; (2) themaximum detection distance; and (3) the average detection distance (Figure 12.5a[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#FIGm-fig-87]). Maximum detection distance refers tothe distance at which prey could detect a given predator with its acute centerof vision (high-quality information), whereas average detection distance refersto the average distance at which prey could detect a given predator with anypart of the retina (high- and low-quality information pooled together). Thereare two relevant visual resolution dimensions that may affect these threeaspects of predator detection, but not necessarily in the same way. First,detection has been proposed to depend on overall visual resolution (Tisdale &Fernández-Juricic 2009 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.65]), which refersto the average resolution across the whole visual field as determined by thesize of the eye (i.e., larger eyes have higher acuity, Pettigrew et al. 1988[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.57]) and the average density ofphotoreceptors/ganglion cells across the whole retina. Second, detection hasbeen proposed to depend on cell-density profiles, which are determined by thevariation in relative cell density between the retinal center of acute visionand the retinal periphery (Dolan & Fernández-Juricic 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.18], Fernández-Juricic et al. 2011b[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.28]; Fernández-Juricic 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.23]; Figure 12.4[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#FIGm-fig-86]).[OEBPS_Images_image00982.jpeg]Figure 12.5Probability of predator detection as a function of distance to predator. (a) Theprobability of detecting a predator (y) can be calculated for any given distance(x). The non-linear nature of the relationship is due to the non-linear decreasein visual contrast over distance. When the area under the curve is equal on bothsides of the dotted line, the dotted line represents the average detectiondistance. (b) Empirical data showing higher detection probabilities over greaterdistances in the European starling (high overall visual resolution) than thehouse sparrow (low overall visual resolution).(Figure adapted from Tisdale & Fernández-Juricic 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.65]).We propose a novel way of representing in space how the visual configuration caninfluence detection behavior with spatial detection maps, which can beparticularly useful to predict spatial variations in perceived predation riskfor different species (Figure 12.6 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#FIGm-fig-88]).Spatial detection maps provide a top-view schematic representation of the areasaround the animal where the probabilities of predator detection are higher as afunction of (a) the configuration of the visual fields; (b) the position of thecenters of acute vision; (c) the cell-density profiles; and (d) the variation invisual contrast and resolution with distance. Spatial detection maps are boundedby the maximum detection distance for any given area of the visual field (blackcontinuous line in Figure 12.6 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#FIGm-fig-88]), whichis estimated based on the limits of visual resolution by eye size and celldensity. The maximum detection distance is expected to vary in different partsof the visual field (binocular, lateral, blind areas), reflecting changes incell density across the retina (Figures 12.2[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#FIGm-fig-84], 12.4[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#FIGm-fig-86]). The highest values of the maximumdetection distance (farthest detection point from the prey) are constrained inspace and given by the projections of the centers of acute vision into visualspace (Figure 12.6 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#FIGm-fig-88]). Average detectiondistance for any given position in the visual field is represented by the dottedline inside the detection map. The probability of detection at any given pointwithin the spatial detection map is represented by grayscale shading (Figure12.6 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#FIGm-fig-88]) and represents the decrease invisual contrast and visual resolution with increasing distances (Tisdale &Fernández-Juricic 2009 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.65]). Theprobability of detection within a given distance range is represented by theproportional area of that range within the spatial detection map weighted by theaverage probability of detection within that distance range.[OEBPS_Images_image00983.jpeg]Figure 12.6Spatial detection map. The solid gray lines provide a scale for the distancefrom the prey. The maximum detection distance a prey (center) is capable of, fora given predator, is bounded by the solid black line. The grayscale within thedetection map represents the probability of detection at any given locationwithin the detection map. The dotted line corresponds to the average detectiondistance around the prey, and the dashed line represents the projection of theprey’s retinal center of acute vision.We can make predictions on the variations in the shape of spatial detection mapsbased on some of the visual properties discussed in the previous section[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#aid-OPELA] (Figure 12.7[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#FIGm-fig-89]). For the sake of clarity, we presentdifferent scenarios, but without considering changes in the probability ofdetection within the spatial detection maps (grayscale in Figure 12.6[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#FIGm-fig-88]).[OEBPS_Images_image00984.jpeg]Figure 12.7Hypothetical spatial detection maps for animals with (a) high overall visualresolution and steep cell-density profile; (b) high overall resolution andshallow cell-density profile; (c) low overall resolution and steep profile; and(d) low overall resolution and shallow profile. Blind areas were kept constantfor clarity purposes.Species with higher overall visual resolution are expected to have greaterprobability of predator detection and greater maximum and average detectiondistances because they can see predators from farther away (Kiltie 2000[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.42]; Tisdale & Fernández-Juricic 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.65]). For example, Tisdale andFernández-Juricic (2009 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.65]) found thatEuropean starlings Sturnus vulgaris (overall visual resolution = 5.9cycles/degree; Dolan & Fernández-Juricic 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.18]) have higher probabilities of detectionand greater detection distances than house sparrows Passer domesticus (overallvisual resolution = 4.5 cycles/degree; Dolan & Fernández-Juricic 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.18]; Figure 12.5b[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#FIGm-fig-87]). Differences in overall visualresolution between species can be translated into spatial detection maps. Forinstance, consider scenarios (b) and (d) in Figure 12.7[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#FIGm-fig-89]. Scenario (b) represents an individualwith higher overall visual resolution than that in scenario (d), whichtranslates into maximum detection distances around 18 m and average detectiondistances around 15 m for (b) and 12 m and 10 m, respectively, for (d).Likewise, the detection map in (b) covers 92% of the area between 10 and 15 m,suggesting a high probability of detecting a predator that appears anywherebetween 10 and 15 m. In scenario (d), on the other hand, the detection map onlycovers 8% of the area between 10 and 15 m, giving the individual a much lowerprobability of predator detection.Species with steep cell-density profiles are expected to have greater maximumdetection distances than species with shallow cell-density profiles, but similaraverage detection distances assuming that species do not vary in overall (oraverage) visual resolution. To illustrate these predictions, Figure 12.7a[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#FIGm-fig-89] shows a species with a steepcell-density profile and Figure 12.7b [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#FIGm-fig-89]one with a shallow density profile. Scenario (a) portrays a maximum detectiondistance greater than 25 m, whereas in scenario (b) maximum detection distanceis around 18 m. Both (a) and (b) have average detection distances around 15 m,but those averages come about in very different ways. In scenario (b), thedetection distance is relatively consistent throughout the visual field, whereasin scenario (a) detection distance is higher in the parts of the visual fieldsubtended by the centers of acute vision and lower in the parts of the visualfield subtended by the retinal periphery. The inconsistency in detectiondistances could lead to the species in scenario (a) actually having lowerprobability of early detection. While the species in scenario (a) couldpotentially detect a predator from greater than 25 m away, it only has a 56%probability of detecting a predator that appears 10 to 15 m away, compared to92% for the species in scenario (b). Therefore prey with steep cell-densityprofiles (Figure 12.7a [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#FIGm-fig-89]) are expected tobecome more reliant on their centers of acute vision for predator detection.This retinal configuration may be most advantageous in environments wherepredators approach from predictable locations that can be consistentlymonitored. For example, many predators attack from cover (Lima et al. 1987[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.50]; Roth & Lima 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.62]), and therefore prey in habitats withlimited cover can focus on monitoring only the most likely areas of attack. Onthe other hand, shallow cell-density profiles may be more advantageous fordetecting predators that could come from anywhere (Hughes 1977[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.38]).Prey with wider visual fields, and thus smaller blind areas, are expected tohave higher probabilities of predator detection because they can see more oftheir environment at any given time than prey with narrower visual fields(Fernández-Juricic et al. 2004 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.25]; Tisdale& Fernández-Juricic 2009 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.65]). Forinstance, blue tits, Cyanistes cyaneus, have a lower probability of detectionwhen a predator appears in their blind areas (Kaby & Lind 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.40]). Figure 12.8[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#FIGm-fig-90] shows why prey with narrower blind areaswould be able to detect a predator in more different head orientations than aprey with wider blind areas.[OEBPS_Images_image00985.jpeg]Figure 12.8Eyes in the back of the head. The circles in this figure represent the visualfield parameters, as viewed from above, of two hypothetical hares (at center ofthe circle) when being chased by a lynx (at bottom of the circle). (a) A harewith a small blind area can partially see a predator directly behind it. (b) Ahare with a large blind area cannot see a predator directly behind. (c) A harewith a small blind area can see a predator in a more lateral position. (d) Ahare with a large blind area cannot always see the predator, even when thepredator is not directly behind it.Prey that are more sensitive to motion are also expected to be better able todetect predator movements and thus have higher probabilities of early detection.There are two independent mechanisms that each could yield greater motiondetection ability: temporal visual resolution and the abundance ofphotoreceptors associated with motion vision. A higher temporal visualresolution is the result of shorter photoreceptor integration times yieldingmore frequent updating of the visual image on the retina (Legge 1978[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.46]). Therefore temporal visual resolutionplays a major role in motion detection, especially in detecting fast movingobjects (Lappin et al. 2009 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.45]) such aspredators. Avian double cone photoreceptors have been associated withmotion-detection ability in studies using physiological (von Campenhausen &Kirschfeld 1998 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.67]) and behavioralapproaches (Goldsmith & Butler 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.29]).Double cones are abundant in most vertebrate retinas (Walls 1942[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.69]; Bowmaker 1990[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.7]; Hart 2001a[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.32]). In European starlings, for example,double cones outnumber all four types of single cones combined (Hart et al. 1998[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.34]). More double cones in the retina wouldconfer more acute motion detection ability because a moving image would passacross more double cone photoreceptors per unit time. For example, bird speciesthat have unobstructed overhead vision (in open habitats) have more double conesin the ventral retina, which projects upward, where aerial predators are likelyto come from; whereas species with obstructed overhead vision (e.g., arborealspecies with branches overhead) have more double cones in the dorsal retina,which projects downward, where ground predators would initiate attacks (Hart2001b [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.33]). We expect visual systems withhigher temporal visual resolution or more double cones to be more sensitive tomotion and increase the probability of early predator detection.Ultimately, the brain prioritizes how the different components of theinformation gathered by the visual system are processed through attentionmechanisms, which involve selectively allocating cognitive resources to aspecific portion of visual field with specific stimuli. Attention is limitedbecause the amount of information received by the sensory systems is greaterthan the amount of information that can be processed by the brain (Milinski 1990[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.55]; Kastner & Ungerleider 2000[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.41]; Dukas 2002[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.19]). The probability of detection isexpected to decrease when an individual is not allocating attention to thesensory modality or region of sensory space within the modality where thepredator becomes detectable (Dukas 2002[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.19]). Interestingly, there are two mainattention mechanisms that occur in different parts of the retina (center ofacute vision vs. retinal periphery). Overt visual attention takes place with thecenter of acute vision, whereas covert visual attention occurs in the retinalperiphery (Bisley 2011 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.3]). Animals oftenuse overt visual attention; for instance, if a moving stimulus is detected withthe retinal periphery, the eye/head will move very quickly to align the centerof acute vision with that stimulus to obtain an image with higher visualresolution (hence, higher information quality; Zani & Proverbio 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.72]; Yorzinski & Platt 2014[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.71]; Figure 12.3[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#FIGm-fig-85]). For example, peafowl, Pavo cristatus,appear to inspect model predators with their centers of acute vision afterdetection with the retinal periphery (Yorzinski & Platt 2014[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.71]).The allocation of cognitive resources between overt and covert attention couldalso vary with the nature of the task, and ultimately influence predatordetection. For instance, blue jays, Cyanocitta cristata, focused on solving acomplex task (e.g., discriminating prey from a visually complex background) havemore difficulty detecting predators elsewhere in their visual fields (Dukas &Kamil 2000 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.20]). This effect could be theresult of an increase in overt attention at the expense of covert attention.Additionally, in species with laterally placed eyes, individuals appear toattend to only one eye at a time and simultaneously suppress input from theunattended eye. However, information processing still occurs in the retina ofthe unattended eye because suppression acts on specific visual centers in thebrain (tectofugal pathway), not on the retina itself (Engelage & Bischof 1988[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.22]; Voss & Bischof 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.68]). Therefore the appearance of a salientobject in the visual field of the unattended eye may be able to override thecentral suppression and redirect attention to the previously unattended eye(Voss & Bischof 2003 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.68]). If this is thecase, a predator moving across the visual field of an unattended eye is morelikely to override attentional suppression if the prey species has a greaterabundance of motion sensitive photoreceptors because the predator’s movementwill stimulate more photoreceptors.12.2.3 ASSESSING PREDATION RISKAfter a stimulus has been detected, the sensory systems are far from done. Preycontinue gathering information with their sensory systems to assess the risk ofa potential threat. Prey modify their perception of risk depending on predatoridentity, predator behavior, how long they have before the predator can strike,and if detected through conspecifics/heterospecifics, whether a predator is evenpresent (Lima & Dill 1990 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.49]). Escapebehaviors are energetically costly and, perhaps more importantly, reduceforaging and mating opportunities. Fitness-wise, it would be in an animal’s bestinterest to only flee when the probability of mortality is high. To that end,sensory systems that gather information more accurately are expected to reducethe incidence of mistakes when deciding on an escape response, and sensorysystems that gather information more quickly or from greater distances areexpected to give prey more time to respond to a predator.From a sensory perspective, it is not totally clear how assessment translatesinto behavioral changes. One of the reasons is that an individual may be engagedin both sensory assessment and other activities (e.g., foraging) simultaneouslywithout necessarily modifying its behavior. For instance, given the wide visualfield of birds and the lateral projection of the foveae in many species(Fernández-Juricic 2012 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.23]), it is likelythat birds could assess a potential threat from a head-down body posture if therisk is not too high. Consequently, we could consider different levels ofsensory assessment: low quality and high quality. Low-quality sensory assessmentis expected to occur when the animal is in a body posture not intended forgaining a large amount of information about the threat (e.g., head down) and/orusing portions of the visual field that do not provide high visual resolution(e.g., retinal periphery). High-quality assessment, on the other hand, isexpected in head-up body postures and/or using the centers of acute vision asindividuals can enhance the amount and quality of visual information obtained.For example, Sceloporus lizards that detect predators with the peripheral retinaflee a short distance to put space between themselves and the predator, thenstop and assess the predation risk with high-quality information before seekingcover (Cooper 2008 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.11]). The implication isthat establishing the duration of assessment (and consequently its costs) wouldrequire measurements that go beyond classic behavioral responses (Cresswell etal. 2009 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.15]) and consider the sensorysystems of the study species (e.g., eye-tracking for birds; Yorzinski & Platt2014 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.71]; Tyrrell et al. 2014[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.66]).A major step in assessing predation risk is the identification of a detectedstimulus as a predator or a non-predator. Identification requires a sufficientlevel of sensory acuity to distinguish certain characteristics of the stimulus.For example, mallards Anas platyrhynchos characterize a silhouette with a shortneck and long tail as a predator (e.g., a hawk) and a silhouette with a longneck and short tail as a non-predator (e.g., a goose) (Green et al. 1968[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.30]). Identification of predators is likelyto be dependent on the centers of acute vision because prey orient them towardpredators (after detection) rather than assessing the predator with the retinalperiphery (Yorzinski & Platt 2014 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.71]).Therefore, species with higher localized visual resolution are expected to havehigher identification distances. Additionally, because predators that arefarther away take more time to reach prey, higher localized visual resolutionwould allow prey to gather information for longer times before making decisionsto flee. The distance at which an animal detects a stimulus (hereafter,detection distance) will be greater than the distance at which it can identifythe stimulus (hereafter, identification distance). Prey may not react to apredator until it is close enough to identify, or prey may actually approach thepredator to identify it (Magurran & Girling 1986[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.52]).In addition to identification, prey estimate time to contact (the amount of timeit will take the predator to reach the prey’s current position), trajectory(whether the predator is approaching the prey directly or tangentially), and themotivational state of the predator to assess the actual risk of predation (Lima& Dill 1990 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.49]). Time to contact informsthe prey how long it has before it can no longer safely flee to cover (Regan &Vincent 1995 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.61]). In the visual system,time to contact and predator trajectory appear to be estimated by the rate andsymmetry of image expansion on the retina, respectively (looming; Regan &Vincent 1995 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.61]). As an object approachesthe viewer, the image of that object will expand on the retina. Faster rates ofimage expansion correspond to objects that will come in contact with the viewermore quickly. If the image expands symmetrically, the object can be interpretedas approaching the viewer directly. If the image expands asymmetrically, theobject is approaching at an angle, and it is moving slightly sideways in thedirection of greater expansion rather than directly toward the viewer. There isevidence across many taxa that animals associate looming stimuli with predation(Schaller & Emlen 1962 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.63]; Schiff 1965[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.64]; Hassenstein & Hustert 1999[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.35]; Carlile et al. 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.9]).12.2.4 ALERT AND ESCAPEMost animals display some kind of alert behavior (e.g., cease foraging, headmovement, extended neck) after detection, but before fleeing. Alert distance hasbeen associated with the detection of a threat (Fernández-Juricic & Schroeder2003 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.24]; Blumstein et al. 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.6]). The rationale is that prey areexpected to switch to an alert posture (i.e., from foraging head-down toscanning head-up) immediately after detection. This leads to the prediction thatalert distance (AD) would be similar to detection distance. However, a recentstudy considering the visual system of prey has challenged this view. Blackwellet al. (2009 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.4]) estimated detectiondistances of brown-headed cowbirds and mourning doves Zenaida macroura based oneye size and the density of retinal ganglion cells as 1012 m and 1363 m,respectively (under optimal light conditions). The authors also measured ADsbehaviorally toward a vehicle approaching them directly, and found that theywere an order of magnitude smaller (71 m and 105 m, respectively). This suggeststhat animals detect early but do not show alert behaviors until later in theapproach sequence. The two implications are that (a) sensory detection isdifficult to measure behaviorally, and (b) detection and alert distances are notnecessarily identical.Another metric that has been linked to detection and alert is starting distance(SD). Some papers have explicitly assumed that SD is higher than AD (i.e., preydo not exhibit alert before the approach begins; Dumont et al. 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.21]). Such assumptions consider that SD ishigher than detection distance. However, as mentioned before, detection distancemay be greater than SD and different sensory configurations could lead todifferent probabilities of detection after the approach begins. Violating theseassumptions may lead to erroneous interpretations of the decision-makingprocesses involved in antipredator responses.Alert behaviors themselves may function as an assessment phase (Cresswell et al.2009 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.15]), but for the most part, thesensory functions of alert have not been empirically tested. We do not know whenthe prey gathers much of the information used for assessment, but it is possiblethat such information is gathered before becoming alert, after becoming alert,or both. The timing of risk assessment in relation to alert behavior could leadto different functions and costs of alert behavior, as well as differences inthe expected slopes of the positive relationship observed between AD and FID(Blumstein et al. 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.6]; Dumont et al.2012 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.21]).If risk assessment occurs after prey display overt alert behaviors, then thefunction of alert may be stabilization of gaze to visually track the predatorand gather information to estimate risk. In this case, alert becomes a costlyactivity as it diverts attention and time from foraging. If assessment requiresa certain amount of time, then we would predict a shallower slope in thepositive relationship between AD and FID (Blumstein et al. 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.6]; Dumont et al. 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.21]), all else being equal. The reason isbecause the time invested in alert would constrain the time the individual hasto flee.The opposite scenario is that an individual assesses risk before becomingovertly alert. In this case, alert behavior might not serve a sensory functionat all, but rather it is simply a signal to the predator reflecting that theprey is aware of its presence (e.g., pursuit detterence; Hasson 2000[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.36]; Caro 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.10]) or a low-cost escape attempt (e.g.,becoming stationary to reduce movement cues about its position; Misslin 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.56]) before the individual resorts to ahigh-cost escape attempt. This scenario would lead to a steeper slope in thepositive relationship between AD and FID (Blumstein et al. 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.6]; Dumont et al. 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.21]), all else being equal. Individualswould be able to quickly flee right after alert, if the situation is riskyenough, without investing time in assessment at that point.A third scenario is that prey have acquired some limited measure of riskassessment before displaying alert behavior. For instance, before becomingalert, an individual could gather some low-quality information while in ahead-down posture or with the periphery of the retina. This initial low-qualitystage will have low attention costs, allowing the individual to continue withother important tasks (e.g., foraging). By having some limited informationavailable before devoting a large amount of sensory resources to the predator,individuals would be able to make an initial decision as to whether the predatorwas threatening enough to become alert or not. After making the decision tobecome alert, individuals would then be able to gather higher qualityinformation while head-up and with the centers of acute vision (Yorzinski &Platt 2014 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.71]). The higher qualityassessment phase would obviously have higher attention costs (Blumstein 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.5]), but would allow for a more accurateestimation of the level of risk before escaping or resuming foraging. Thisscenario would lead to an intermediate slope in the positive relationshipbetween AD and FID (Blumstein et al. 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.6]; Dumont et al. 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.21]), all else being equal, because low-and high-quality assessment may require certain amounts of time.12.3 IMPLICATIONS FOR PREDATOR–PREY INTERACTIONSFrom a sensory perspective, the prey’s ultimate goal is to detect predatorsbefore being detected and to assess their level of risk to determine if they are(1) in danger and should flee, or (2) safe from predation and should resumeother activities. However, there appears to be variability between prey speciesin detection distances due to the configuration of the sensory systems (Kiltie2000 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.42]). Prey with greater long-distancesensory detection abilities can gather information for a longer period of timebefore making a decision to flee (Figure 12.9a[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#FIGm-fig-91]). However, prey with short-distancesensory detection abilities will have less time to gather the same information(Figure 12.9b [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#FIGm-fig-91]), potentially leading to ascenario where time to contact is shorter than the time it takes to identify andflee from a predator (Figure 12.9c [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#FIGm-fig-91]).This brings up an interesting question: how do species with more constrainedsensory systems successfully avoid predators? There is a continuum of potential(non-mutually exclusive) explanations that should be investigated in the future.On one end of the continuum, prey with more constrained sensory systems and thusless time to engage in assessment may trade-off with other sensory modalities(or dimensions within a given modality) or components of the antipredatorbehavior sequence (Figure 12.1 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#FIGm-fig-83]). Forinstance, species with smaller body mass tend to have lower spatial visualresolution because of smaller eye sizes (Kiltie 2000[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.42]), reducing detection distances, andhence detection times (Figure 12.9b [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#FIGm-fig-91]).However, a recent study found that smaller species have higher temporal visualresolution (Healy et al. 2013 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.37]), whichsuggests that they may be able to get necessary information about a predator ina shorter period of time because they can gather information at a faster rate.Alternatively, species with more constrained sensory systems may have enhancedescape abilities. For example, cockroaches that detect predators at very closerange (Figure 12.9c [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#FIGm-fig-91]) have exceptionallyquick response times (Camhi et al. 1978[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.8]). Because cockroaches can escape soquickly, early detection becomes less important. On the other end of thecontinuum, species may forgo assessment completely and flee as soon as apredator is detected (Figure 12.9c [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#FIGm-fig-91];Blumstein, 2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.5]).[OEBPS_Images_image00986.jpeg]Figure 12.9Sensory systems can influence the ability to make correct decisions whenassessing predation risk. In this figure, detection time refers to the momentthe prey first detects a potential predator. The length of the black bar to theright of the bird represents the amount of time it will take for the bird toflee to cover. The black bar to the left of the bird (minimum flight initiationtime) represents the last possible moment in time that the bird can safely fleeto cover. The length of the gray bar represents the amount of time the bird hasto assess the likelihood of an attack. Species with more sensitive or acutesensory organs (a) can detect potential predators sooner, and therefore havemore time to gather additional information than prey whose sensory organs havelower detection ranges (b). For a prey whose sensory organs do not detect thepredator until close to minimum flight initiation time (e.g., surprise predatorattack), detection time must be only slightly greater than or equal to minimumflight initiation time if the prey is to escape (c).Different hypotheses have been proposed to explain the rules animals may followwhen making the decision to stay and assess or to flee. The perceptual limitshypothesis, for example, predicts that species will detect a predator andimmediately flee (Quinn & Cresswell 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.59]). From a sensory perspective, theperceptual limits hypothesis excludes the risk-assessment phase. Therefore, therelevant sensory dimensions that influence the prey response would be thosecontributing to detection of predators (see above). Other hypotheses, however,make different predictions but consider a risk-assessment phase. The economichypothesis predicts that prey will delay fleeing until the risk of predationoutweighs the benefits of continuing other tasks (Ydenberg & Dill 1986[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.70]). The optimality hypothesis is similarto the economic hypothesis, but predicts that prey will flee when the accruedfitness gains from staying are optimized, whereas the economic hypothesispredicts flight when fitness gains and losses break even (Cooper and Frederick2007 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.13]). The flush early and avoid therush (FEAR) hypothesis predicts that prey will only delay fleeing for a shorttime because the attention costs of tracking a predator can outweigh the costsof fleeing early and losing foraging time (Blumstein 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.5]). Therefore the major difference betweenthe optimality and FEAR hypotheses is the cost of attention associated with therisk-assessment phase (Cooper & Blumstein 2014[OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#REFe-r-12.12]). From a sensory perspective, we couldexpect species that can minimize the attention costs associated with riskassessment (e.g., wide visual fields that can take advantage of tracking thepredator with the periphery of the retina through lateral vision whilesimultaneously engaging in other tasks) to fall on the optimality hypothesis endof the spectrum. Conversely, species with very high attention costs (e.g.,narrow visual fields that require ceasing other tasks to track the predator withthe centers of acute vision) would fall on the FEAR hypothesis end of thespectrum.Overall, many of the sensory mechanisms underlying predator–prey interactionsremain poorly understood, presenting a largely unexplored avenue to investigatemany proximate as well as ultimate questions about the sensory basis for escapebehavior. Future studies could also benefit from a comparative approach tounderstand the important environmental factors that drive differences in thesensory ecology and antipredator behaviors across taxa.REFERENCESBeauchamp, G.

Caroline Blanchard, and Robert J. Blanchard13.1 INTRODUCTIONIn this chapter we review physiological mechanisms and correlates of flight orescape behavior. Although aspects of the physiology of flight have been studiedin many prey taxa, our knowledge of physiological mechanisms has largely beenobtained in studies of rodents. In much of this book, the focus is on decisionsto flee, especially the decision about how close to allow a predator to approachbefore beginning to flee. In a typical field study, this is measured as flightinitiation distance (FID), the distance between an approaching predator and theprey when the prey starts to flee. In part because the vast majority of studiesof the physiology of escape have been done in laboratories in small spaces, verylittle is known about physiological influences on FID. However, flight is onecomponent of a complex array of defensive behaviors to predators and otherthreat stimuli that has been intensively investigated in recent years, and asubstantial body of information has accumulated about the endocrine,pharmacological, and neuroanatomical systems involved in defense. These findingsare outlined here.13.2 DEFENSIVE BEHAVIORS AND PHYSIOLOGY13.2.1 DEFENSIVE BEHAVIORS (SEE FIGURE 13.1[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#FIGm-fig-92] FOR SUMMARY)Defensive behaviors comprise a group of immediate and direct behavioralreactions to threats to life and bodily safety (Blanchard et al. 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.13]). Many defensive behaviors are evolvedresponses to the types of stimuli and situations that were frequent dangers inthe evolutionary histories of a species, evolving as a result of thesurvival/reproductive success that they afforded to individuals displaying themappropriately. In this context “appropriately” means not only that the defensesbe well executed, but also that each individual defensive behavior is one thathas been particularly successful in response to that particular type of threat,and in that particular type of situation. Flight, avoidance, freezing, defensivethreat, defensive attack, and risk assessment to threatening stimuli have beencharacterized in a variety of species, as have some other behaviors, e.g.,burying of novel, aversive, or potentially dangerous objects, or alarm cries,that may be functional in particular threat situations (Blanchard 1997[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.5]; Litvin et al. 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.54]).[OEBPS_Images_image00987.jpeg]Figure 13.1Fear- and anxiety-like defensive behaviors are modulated by subject–threatdistance and context. Notably, the availability of escape enables flight, whileits absence promotes freezing.(Used with permission from Litvin & Pfaff 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.53])13.2.2 ENDOCRINE ROLES IN DEFENSEEvolution has shaped organisms that are adequately adapted to a dynamic, attimes hostile, environment. The brain detects a stimulus from the environment,integrates it with internal states, and in response potentiates appropriatephysiology and behavior. The process of maintaining a constant, stabile internalmilieu in a changing setting is termed “allostasis” and the ability tocontinually adapt by learning appropriate behaviors indicates “resilience”(Karatsoreos & McEwen 2013 [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.51]). Chronicstress leads to wear and tear on the body and brain and is thus termed“allostatic load” (McEwen 2007 [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.57]). Insituations when an organism is faced with a threat, correctly executed escapebehaviors are essential for survival and future propagation of the species.Further, after an escape is successful a quick return to non-defensivebehaviors, e.g., territorial defense, foraging, or copulation, promotes rankwithin a social hierarchy and reproductive success (Blanchard & Blanchard 1989[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.6]).W. B. Cannon and P. Bard were the first to systematically examine the physiologyof escape in the first half of the twentieth century (Cannon 1915[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.19], 1927[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.20]; Bard 1928[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.2]). Cannon and Bard’s findings linkedactivity in the brain stem and hypothalamus with behavioral and peripheralmanifestations of emotions. Their studies provided the first associationsbetween secretion of epinephrine from the adrenal medulla, peripheralmobilization, and emotional responses, indicating that the adrenals play a rolein activation of the muscles and promote sugar metabolism. This“fight-or-flight” response facilitates increases in heart rate, circulation rateand depth, rate of respiration to facilitate oxygenation of necessary muscles,sweating for temperature regulation, increases in glucose metabolism for energy,redirection of blood from the skin and gut to muscles, and increases in bloodclotting in preparation for bodily injury. In addition, the sympathetic branchof the autonomic nervous system facilitates the cognitive enhancement due toepinephrine release from the adrenal medulla.Autonomic activation begins at the central nucleus of the amygdala, whereincorticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is synthesized and subsequently releasedinto the locus coeruleus, stimulating the release of norepinephrine andepinephrine into the general circulation, which in turn activate the peripheralautonomic response including cardiovascular responses (heart rate and bloodpressure), body temperature regulation, perspiration, and bronchiole dilation(Cannon 1915 [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.19], 1927[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.20]).The endocrine stress response also involves activation of thehypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. This process commences whenneuroendocrine cells in the medial parvocellular division of the paraventricularnucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) release the 41 amino acid neuropeptide CRF(Spiess et al. 1981 [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.75]; Vale et al. 1981[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.80]) as well as oxytocin and argininevasopressin (Turner et al. 1951 [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.79]; Tuppy1953 [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.78]; Du Vigneaud et al. 1953[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.34]). CRF travels axonally to the medianeminence and is subsequently released into the hypophysial portal system, whichleads to the anterior pituitary. At this location it binds to corticotrophs tostimulate the release of adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH). As a result, ACTHis released into the bloodstream where it causes the secretion ofglucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex: cortisol in humans and corticosterone(CORT) in rodents. The HPA axis is tightly controlled by a number of centralnegative feedback sites; specifically, the hypothalamus, pituitary, andhippocampus have been identified as major brain targets ofglucocorticoid-mediated regulation (see Herman et al. 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.45] for a review). Glucocorticoids mobilizeenergy by promoting catabolism of proteins, glycogen, and triglycerides,stimulating gluconeogenesis in the liver and kidneys, and augmentingcardiovascular effects of catecholamines at target tissues by enhancingepinephrine release and sharpening cognition. Glucocorticoids also inhibitphysiological and biochemical processes in the body that are either unnecessaryin times of danger or can interfere with appropriate escape. These includesuppression of systems related to digestion, reproduction, and immunity.Although both CRF and glucocorticoids aid in the facilitation of an appropriateresponse to stressors that ultimately enhances chances of survival, chronicrelease of these hormones has been shown to produce deleterious effects on anumber of bodily processes, such as immunity, digestion, learning and memory,and reproduction (McEwen 2007 [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.57]).The level of HPA activation, i.e., glucocorticoid release, is used as a validmeasure of the health of an individual and of a population within an ecologicalsystem (Romero 2004 [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.70]). As such it isimportant to notice the factors that affect glucocorticoid release in responseto a stressor when examining physiology of defensive behaviors such as flight.These include genetic influences on the HPA axis as well as epigenetic factors.Genetic factors determine glucocorticoid receptor distribution, which in turnaffect rate of termination/recovery from HPA activation, while epigeneticfactors include early-life experience (trauma/enrichment), subjugation tochronic stressors during the lifetime of the animal, all of which can alterexpression of genes relevant to a stress response (McEwen 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.57]).Stress produces structural remodeling in the hippocampus, amygdala, andprefrontal cortex with these changes altering behavioral and physiologicalresponses to subsequent stressors (McEwen 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.57]). For example, stress-inducedactivation of adrenergic and glucocorticoid receptors modulates memory-enhancingeffects that facilitate resilience by regulating defensive behavior (escape,among others) toward a learned stimulus (Lupien & McEwen 1997[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.56]; McGaugh & Roozendaal 2002[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.58]; Karatsoreos & McEwen 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.51]). Glucocorticoids are also involved inneuronal excitability and long-term potentiation in the hippocampus, consistentwith a role in memory storage (Diamond et al. 1992[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.32]; Joels & de Kloet 1992[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.48]). The hippocampus is a major target ofadrenal steroids and is said to modulate memory processes via intracellularcascades that result from glucocorticoid and adrenergic receptor activation. Theputative molecular mechanisms involve glucocorticoid-mediated expression ofneural cell adhesion molecules, which in turn cause synaptic structural changes(McGaugh & Roozendaal 2002 [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.58]). In fact,post-training injections of corticosterone, the principal rat glucocorticoid, orother specific glucocorticoid agonists, into the hippocampus enhance memoryconsolidation in an inverted-U fashion, with lesions of the basolateral nucleusof the amygdala blocking this type 2-glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-mediatedeffect (Micheau et al. 1984 [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.60]; Roozendaalet al. 1997 [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.72], 2004[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.73]).A single study suggests that glucocorticoids affect flight initiation distance(FID) in the field. In the lizard Sceloporus undulatus, FID increases during aseries of successive approaches by a predator (Thaker et al. 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.77]). However, following injection ofmetapyrone, which blocks synthesis of corticosterone, FID failed to increaseduring repeated approaches (Thaker et al. 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.77]). This study suggests that some of thephysiological mechanisms influencing escape and related behaviors in laboratorytests may apply as well to FID and related behaviors in the field.13.2.3 ANATOMY/NEUROCHEMISTRY OF FLIGHT-RELEVANT DEFENSE SYSTEMSSeveral excellent reviews (e.g., Johnson et al. 1995[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.49]; Carrasco & Van de Kar 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.25]; Quintino-dos-Santos et al. 2014[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.68]) have documented the history ofattempts to describe the brain circuitry involved in defensive behaviors. Amajor difficulty in relating these unequivocally to flight is that there may bequite different brain systems underlying defensiveness to different types ofthreat stimuli, even though most or all of these stimuli can elicit flight as aconsistent and substantial component of the defense pattern. Canteras and Graeff(2014 [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.22]), provide information, and indeedschematics, of focal neuroanatomic components of the defense systems, fordefensiveness to stimuli conditioned to painful experiences; and to fear basedon predator exposure or on social defeat. In addition, Canteras and Graeff (2014[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.22]) describe neural systems underlyingfear to interoceptive challenges such as cardiac arrhythmias, visceral pain, andhypoxia, all of which represent threat to the organism. None of the latter isassociated with a substantial range of potentially effective defensive behaviors– indeed no behavior is likely to remedy an acute cardiac arrhythmia – but it isnotable that hypoxia, associated with suffocation, might be expected to involvebehavioral attempts to deal with the cause of the suffocation, potentiallyincluding fight or flight responses (Klein 1993[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.52]). These different types of threatstimuli and how they may be differentially involved in activity in specificsites in the brain are discussed extensively in Gross and Canteras (2012[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.43]).Predator stimuli, to this date more often used than any natural threats inanalyses of the neuroanatomy of defensiveness, typically involve a cat, or catfur/skin odor, or odors derived from another predator, e.g., trimethylthiazoline(TMT), a component of fox feces (Apfelbach et al. 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.1]). These predator stimuli all elicit someelements of defense, but there are striking differences among the specificbehaviors seen: cat exposure typically involves confrontation of the (usuallyrat) subject with a cat that is caged or otherwise restrained from actualcontact with the subject. In most such situations, flight is limited by thedimensions of the test cage, and freezing is by far the predominant responseseen: for example, Motta et al. (2009 [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.62])reported that about 97% of a five-minute test period involving confrontation ofa rat with a caged cat involved freezing. While it is plausible that themotivation to flee was definitely present for these rat subjects, flight itself,and the neural circuitry supporting the actual behaviors involved in flight,would be expected to be less activated in these tests. Similarly, cat odor tendsto involve freezing, but this may be mixed with some approach – investigationalactivities (risk assessment) that are typically associated with more ambiguousthreat stimuli (Blanchard et al. 2011 [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.14]).Trimethylthiazoline, while it does not robustly support fear learning (Blanchardet al. 2003b [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.12]) and produces a brainactivation pattern rather different than cat odor (Staples et al. 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.76]), is also used extensively for studiesof the physiology of defense (Rosen 2004[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.74]). Freezing rather than more activedefense is the actual behavior associated with the brain activation in most ofthese studies. However, it is clear that confrontation with a predator doesindeed elicit flight when this is possible, so these studies are nonethelessrelevant to analyses of the neural systems involved in flight/escape. In keepingwith the focus of this book, findings from the predator exposure model(s) willbe the center of attention here.Predator odors activate olfactory pathways projecting to the medial amygdala,and after predator (cat) odor exposure activation of the immediate early genec-Fos is seen specifically in the posteroventral part of the medial amygdala(MeApv; Dielenberg et al. 2001 [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.33]), withadditional high-level expression (compared to that seen with a strong butnon-predator odor) in the dorsomedial part of the ventromedial nucleus of thehypothalamus (VMHdm), the hypothalamic dorsal premammillary nucleus (PMd), andthe dorsomedial, dorsolateral (and more caudal levels), and the ventrolateralperiaqueductal gray matter of the midbrain (PAGdm, PAGdl, and PAGvl,respectively). These findings are in agreement with reports from Canteras et al.(2002 [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.21]) of the organization ofhypothalamic nuclei activated in exposure of a rat to a live cat (see Figure13.2 [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#FIGm-fig-93] for summary). Notably, thesefindings implicated the basolateral and lateral nuclei of the amygdala as wellas the MeA. The former receive inputs from a number of sensory systems, likelyreflecting additional sensory information about the cat, rather than the catodor alone that was provided in Dielenberg et al. (2001[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.33]).[OEBPS_Images_image00988.jpeg]Figure 13.2A schematic diagram showing the putative brain systems involved in processingpredatory and conspecific threats and in organizing predator and conspecificdefense. Abbreviations: AHN, anterior hypothalamic nucleus; BMAp, basomedialamygdalar nucleus, posterior part; LA, lateral amygdalar nucleus; MEAad, -pd,and -pv, medial amygdalar nucleus, anterodorsal, posterodorsal, andposteroventral parts; MPO, medial preoptic area; PAGdl, -dm, and -l,periaqueductal gray, dorsolateral, dorsomedial, and lateral parts; PMDdm and-vl, dorsal premammillary nucleus, dorsomedial, and ventrolateral parts; PMV,ventral premammillary nucleus; VMHdm and -vl, ventromedial nucleus, dorsomedialand ventrolateral parts.(Used with permission from Motta et al. 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.62])With reference to this core set of hypothalamic nuclei, the medial amygdala,projects via the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, to the VMHdm (Cezario etal. 2008 [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.26]). In addition, the MeAprojects to the ventral hippocampus and in turn information from the hippocampusprojects via the septum to the anterior hypothalamic nucleus (AHN), and thelateral hypothalamic area (LHA) (Petrovich et al. 2001[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.65]). Lesions of the ventral hippocampusreduced freezing and enhanced non-defensive behaviors to cat presentation(Pentkowski et al. 2006 [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.64]). Stronginvolvement of the hippocampus in spatial representation (O’Keefe & Nadel 1978[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.63]) suggests that these projections maycarry information relative to the context in which the predator stimuli appear(a crucial feature in the choice of defensive behaviors, especially the balancebetween freezing and flight (Blanchard & Blanchard 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.7]). The latter areas are interconnected,and connect also to the VMHdm, and all three of these project to the PMD(Cezario et al. 2008 [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.26]), that, in turn,projects to dorsal parts of the PAG.Cytotoxic lesions or muscimol (GABAA agonist-induced) blockade of the PMdproduced profound reductions in defensive responding to cat-related stimuli andalso a reduction in Fos activation of the dorsal PAG (Cesario et al. 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.26]). These relationships are schematizedin Cesario et al. (2008 [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.26]), including anadditional connection of the PMd to the ventral part of the anteromedial nucleusof the thalamus. This area provides a connection to a component of the cingulatecortex that may be involved in eye/head movements associated with attention(Risold & Swanson 1995 [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.69]). Canteras etal. (2008 [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.23]) reported that the NMDAantagonist AP5, injected into the PMd, also reduced conditioning to acoffee-odor stimulus associated with footshock, consonant with a view that thePMd, through its connections to the cingulate cortex, may be accessingattentional and associational mechanisms for defensive behavior.A number of recent studies have outlined differences in the neural circuitry ofdefensive behaviors elicited by different types of threat stimuli (Motta et al.2009 [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.62]; Gross & Canteras 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.43]; Canteras & Graeff 2014[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.22]), finding substantial differences forsystems associated with responsivity to predators, conspecifics, and conditionedthreat stimuli associated with pain. However, in contrast to its immediateresponsivity to predator stimuli, defensiveness to conspecifics in laboratoryrats tends to require contact, and the pain of biting attack (Blanchard &Blanchard 1989 [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.6]). A bitten animal quicklydisplays defensive behaviors that have been differentially evaluated, in onerecent study of associated neural activation (Motta et al. 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.62]), as active responses (flight, boxing,and an upright defense of pushing off the attacker) vs. passive responses(freezing and lying on the back – the so-called “submissive” posture). The Mottaet al. (2009 [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.62]) studies thus provide thepossibility to differentiate passive and active defenses in terms of areasactivated during these behaviors, and to determine behavior changes whenrelevant areas are inactivated. They report that while predator exposureproduces Fos upregulation in the ventrolateral portions of the PMd, conspecificthreat/attack results in enhanced Fos in the dorsomedial PMd (Motta et al. 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.62]). Lesions that affect the entire PMdstrikingly disrupt defensive behaviors to a cat, but when conspecific threat isused such lesions reduce only passive defenses, with active defenses showing anon-significant but substantial increase.While this pattern of results does indicate a differentiation of PMdinactivation effects on active vs. passive defenses, suggesting that the PMd maybe less involved with the former than with the latter, an alternativeexplanation is that it is consonant with the interpretation of a generaldecrease in the intensity of defensiveness after PMd lesions. In particular,lying on the back or “submission” is a high-intensity response to threat, withaccompanying signs of autonomic and glucocorticoid arousal (e.g., Fokkema &Koolhaas 1985 [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.36]; Huhman et al. 1990[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.47]), whereas active defenses such asupright pushing away of the opponent and flight may under some circumstancesactually reduce stress responsivity (Viken et al. 1989[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.82]). Thus a reduction of “passive” infavor of more active defensive responses may reflect a change in the intensityof the threat motivation rather than alteration of a system underlying aspecific type of defensive behavior.13.2.4 SYSTEMIC DRUG EFFECTS ON DEFENSIVE BEHAVIORS, INCLUDING FLIGHTPreclinical animal models are utilized in the study of unconditioned andconditioned behaviors potentially related to fear and anxiety, with a view tounderstanding their neural and endocrine correlates, and their underlyingetiology, and to screen novel pharmaceuticals aimed at alleviating theseconditions. Such assays include high-throughput models; for example, theelevated plus-maze (EPM), open field, elevated T-maze (ETM), light/dark box,social interaction test, and separation-induced ultrasonic vocalizations. Theyalso include more ethologically relevant models such as seminatural visibleburrow systems (VBS) and other situations where rats or mice are confronted bypredators or predator-related stimuli (Blanchard & Blanchard 1989[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.6]; Litvin et al. 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.54]; Motta et al. 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.62]).Two animal models: the elevated T-maze (ETM) and the mouse defense test battery(MDTB) are particularly relevant to flight/escape behaviors. The MDTB wascreated specifically to enable evaluation of the magnitude of a range ofdefensive behaviors of mice (Mus musculus) to a hand-held, anesthetized rat.Because rats are predators of mice (Blanchard et al. 2003a[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.11]), they elicit strong defensivebehaviors in mice, with the form or type of defense varying with the movementsof the rat and features of the threat situation (Blanchard et al. 2003a[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.11]). In the MDTB, in which features of thethreat stimulus and situation are varied in order to elicit a number ofdifferent defensive behaviors in succession, profiles of changes in variousdefensive responses to a given drug manipulation can be obtained in a singletest session.Results of pharmacological manipulations of mice assessed using the MDTB suggestthat a number of neuroactive chemicals may enhance or reduce defensive behaviorsin a relatively non-specific fashion. Intracerebroventricular administration ofCRF tends to enhance the predominant defensive behavior elicited by eachstimulus combination of threat and situation utilized in the MDTB (Yang et al.2006 [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.83]). Blanchard et al. (2001[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.10]) reported that a number ofbenzodiazepines (BZPs) alter flight in the MDTB. However, for most BZPs therewas no selective effect on flight with doses that did not impair motor function.However, two benzodiazepines, alprazolam given on a chronic, but not acute,basis (Griebel et al. 1995b [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.41]) andclonazepam (Griebel et al. 1996 [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.42])selectively impaired mouse escape responses. In addition, chronic administrationof the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) fluoxetine and paroxetineboth robustly reduced flight (Griebel et al. 1995a[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.40]; Beijamini & Andreatini 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.3]). In contrast, cocaine and yohimbinesubstantially and selectively increase flight compared to other aspects ofdefensiveness (Blanchard et al. 1993 [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.8],1999 [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.9]). As the drugs selectively reducingflight are clinically effective against panic, while cocaine and yohimbine mayprecipitate or enhance panic (Cox et al. 1990[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.28]; Bourin et al. 1998[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.16]), these findings suggest that flightmay serve as a relatively selective animal model for panic disorder (Blanchardet al. 1993 [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.8]; Griebel et al. 1996[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.42]).The elevated T-maze (ETM) has been used even more extensively in the analysis offlight/escape responses. The ETM consists of three elevated arms – one enclosedand two open, forming a “T”. To assess inhibitory avoidance, a subject is placedat the end of the enclosed arm and the latency to exit this arm is recorded inthree consecutive trials. Inhibitory avoidance learning is indicated by theincrease in withdrawal latency across trials. Thirty seconds after thecompletion of avoidance training, the second behavioral task (one-way escape) ismeasured. For this, the animal is placed at the end of one of the open arms ofthe maze and the withdrawal latency from this arm is similarly registered inthree consecutive trials.The ETM was designed specifically to separate these defensive behaviors (Deakin& Graeff 1991 [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.31]) with the underlyingpremise that inhibitory avoidance and escape responses are differentiallyregulated by serotonin (5-HT) released from fibers in the dorsal raphe nucleus(DRN), a midbrain structure that innervates neural substrates particularlyinvolved in defensive behaviors (e.g., amygdala, frontal cortex, dorsalperiaqueductal gray (dPAG), among others) (Graeff et al. 1993[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.39]; Viana et al. 1994[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.81]). This emphasis on the separation ofinhibitory avoidance of the open arms of the ETM and escape from the same openarms was associated with interpretation of the former as a model of generalizedanxiety, while the latter, escape, was viewed as an animal model for panic.Zangrossi and Graeff (2014 [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.84]) haveconducted a number of experiments to behaviorally validate the ETM. Theirresults showed that rats trained on an ETM with three enclosed arms did not showthe increase in withdrawal latency along three consecutive trials that is oftenobserved in the standard ETM procedure. Therefore, open arm experience seems tobe critical for inhibitory avoidance learning. Moreover, over repeated trials inan open arm, animals left at increasingly higher speeds. Both findings areconsonant with a view that the open arms are aversive, and that repeatedplacement in the closed arm or an open arm does elicit avoidance, or escape,respectively. Indeed, repeated open arm experience appears to enhance thesensitivity of the resulting escape response to drug effects.Zangrossi and Graeff (2014 [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.84]) alsosummarize the effects of systemic drugs on escape from the open arms of the ETM.Briefly, reduction of escape from the open arms was produced by acuteadministration of the benzodiazepine alprazolam, and the SSRI paroxetine, withno effect from acute treatment of a number of additional benzodiazepines and5-HT-acting drugs. Similarly, chronic treatment (9–14 days) with thebenzodiazepine diazepam, and the 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist buspironefailed to alter escape. However, chronic treatment with a number of SSRIs,including sertraline, paroxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, and clomipramine allreduced escape, as did chronic treatment with the tricyclic imipramine.Moreover, most of these positive effects on escape were obtained in tests inwhich there was no alteration of the inhibitory avoidance effect, indicting arelatively selective effect of these treatments. Finally, as SSRIs arefrequently the first choice drugs for treatment of panic, with effects thatusually appear after chronic administration, while alprazolam is the onlybenzodiazepine with antipanic efficacy at non-sedative doses, this pattern ofresults is very supportive of a view that escape measured in the ETM can serveas an animal model of panic (Mochcovitch & Nardi 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.61]).Additional evidence of involvement of serotonin in flight-escape is suggested byfindings that injection into the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH) of thepreferential 5-HT2a agonist, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI), or of the5-HT1a receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT, raised the threshold for escape responses(running or jumping reactions) elicited by electrical stimulation of the DMH.Both of these effects were enhanced by chronic systemic administration ofimipramine, a strong inhibitor of serotonin reuptake that also affects severalother neurotransmitters, and the DOI effect was enhanced by chronic fluoxetine,which inhibits serotonin reuptake (de Bortoli et al. 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.29]). As noted earlier, the relationshipbetween these findings and antipredator flight is complicated, in that the DMHis not part of what is currently regarded as the antipredator circuitry of thehypothalamus, although it is prominently featured in neural responsivity toconspecific threat (Canteras & Graeff 2014[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.22]). However, this difference in circuitrymay be at least partly the result of a methodological difference between the useof predators and conspecifics as threat stimuli, with the latter, alone, beingallowed to actually attack (and cause pain) to the subject in such experiments:this possibility requires additional investigation.The same caveat, that the relevant locale may not be part of the antipredatorcircuitry of the brain, applies to orexins/hypocretins, which are hypothalamicpeptides located preferentially in the perifornical area, that may also affectescape responses. Orexin is co-localized with glutamate and is involved inregulation of a number of neurovegetative activities (see Johnson et al. 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.50] for review). Afferent connections toorexin neurons originate in a host of sites such as the septohippocampal system(Hahn & Swanson 2012 [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.44]) and involveneurochemicals such as GABA and serotonin (Johnson et al. 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.50]) that are important for defensiveness.In turn, orexin neurons project to a variety of putative defense areas. One ofthese, the dorsal raphe (Lowry et al. 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.55]), is of particular interest (seebelow).Glutamate receptors, including the n-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) type, withinthe dorsal or dorsolateral PAG play a major role in the initiation of PAG-evokeddefensive behaviors, specifically escape. Microinjection of NMDA into this areaproduced flight-related behaviors (galloping, jumping) in a dose-dependentmanner, thus mimicking the response to electrical stimulation in this region(Bittencourt et al. 2004 [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.4]). In fact,NMDA-induced excitation of the dorsal PAG elicits a range of defensivebehaviors, from freezing to escape, with freezing evoked at lower doses andescape, at higher levels (Cardoso et al. 1994[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.24]).The dorsal PAG expresses high levels of GABA (Ferreira-Netto et al. 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.35]). GABAergic fibers from the substantianigra and the pars reticulata exert an inhibitory effect on aversive behaviorinduced by dorsolateral PAG stimulation (Coimbra & Brandao 1993[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.27]). These GABA receptors are modulated ina dose-dependent manner by benzodiazepines (Bovier et al. 1982[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.17]). Further evidence for GABA involvementin this region is that microinjection of GABA antagonists, such as bicuculline,into the midbrain tectum induce flight and autonomic reactions similar to thoseof the defense response (Brandao et al. 1982[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.18]; Melo et al. 1992[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.59]). As with NMDA agonists, escalatingdoses of GABA antagonists produce freezing and escape, respectively (Graeff 1990[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.37]). In addition, prior treatment withchlordiazepoxide (a benzodiazepine hypnotic and muscle relaxant) inhibits escapeinduced by bicuculline, an antagonist of GABA receptors (Borelli et al. 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.15]) and prior bicuculline injectionabolishes the inhibitory effect of benzodiazepines (Brandao et al. 1982[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.18]). Collectively, these findingsimplicate a GABA-benzodiazepine system in the midbrain tectum as an inhibitor ofescape.The dorsal raphe nuclei of the midbrain receive input from orexin neurons in thehypothalamic perifornical area and provide an inhibitory serotonergic input tothe dorsal PAG (Lowry et al. 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.55]).Drug injections into the dorsal raphe that enhance serotonin release from thePAG tend to inhibit flight in the ETM (Graeff 1997[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.38]). Roncon et al. (2013[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.71]) demonstrated an opioid effect in thisarea: morphine in the dPAG increased escape latency in the ETM. Moreover, boththe 5-HT1a agonist 8-OH-DPAT and the 5-HT2a agonist DOI produced anti-escapeeffects, but only the first of these was antagonized by naloxone. Additionalstudies in this series (Roncon et al. 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.71]) supported an interaction ofserotonergic and opioidergic mechanisms in the dPAG.The SSRIs fluoxetine and paroxetine (as well as alprazolam) reduced flight-likeescape behavior produced in rats by electrical stimulation of the dPAG (Hogg etal. 2006 [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.46]). These data are in agreementwith ETM findings for dPAG injections of the same agonists, again in rats(Zanoveli et al. 2003 [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.85]; de Paula Soares& Zangrossi 2004 [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.30]). Connecting thisescape measure to the flight seen in the MDTB and providing considerableevidence of consistency across rat and mouse subjects, injections of the 5-HT1Aagonist 8-OH-DPAT, and the preferential 5-HT2A receptor agonist DOI into thedPAG, consistently reduced flight speed and distance run during escape in theMDTB, and increased contacts of the mouse subjects with an anesthetized rat(Pobbe & Zangrossi 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.66]). However, the5-HT1a antagonist WAY-100635, which impaired escape in the ETM (Pobbe &Zangrossi 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.66]), did not affectdefensive behaviors in the MDTB (Pobbe et al. 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#REFe-r-13.67]).In summary, these findings suggest that flight is modulated by some relativelyspecific neurotransmitter mechanisms involving particular brain circuitry. Theyindicate relatively good agreement among the several measures of flight thathave been devised to differentiate flight from other defensive behaviors orspecifically to measure responsiveness of flight to drugs and other variablesthat affect the modulation of panic. These findings also support the concept ofa specific link between flight and panic.13.3 CONCLUSIONSNearly a century of research using increasingly sophisticated and multifacetedneuroscience methodologies has produced a great deal of information onendocrine, neuroanatomic, and neurochemical systems involved in defensivebehaviors, including flight/escape. The components of these systems thatspecifically control flight/panic, as distinct from other defensive behaviors,have received a great deal of recent attention and analysis due to anincreasingly well-established association of flight/escape with panic. However,research on escape decisions based on costs and benefits of fleeing such asflight initiation distance, distance fled, and hiding time in refuge, are alsoneeded to determine the physiological underpinnings of escape decisions that arethe foci of economic models of escape (see Chapter 2[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#CN-bp-2]).REFERENCESApfelbach, R., Blanchard, C.

Lancaster14.1 INTRODUCTIONDespite our understanding that escape behaviors are often optimized under strongand chronic selection, few studies have examined how these behaviors aretransmitted, and this lack of information impedes knowledge of how escapebehaviors can evolve. In this chapter, I review studies that have identifiedpotential mechanisms of escape behavior transmission, from estimates ofheritability of escape behavior and other quantitative genetic parameters, tofamily-, population-, and species-level effects on escape that are suggestive ofheritability and local adaptation, to specific maternal effect mechanisms thatorganize escape behavior. This review provides an overview of the current stateof the field, with discusion of how escape behavior may become adaptivelyintegrated phenotypically with other components of an animal’s biology,including morphology, life-history, and reproductive strategies. This chapter isintended as a foundation for further research directions and to identify thelargest gaps in what is currently known. As predator–prey regimes are altered byhuman influences on the environment, it is becoming increasingly critical todetermine whether and how prey animals will continue to optimize escapedecisions. Understanding the evolvability of escape behavior is a criticalcomponent of this endeavor.Predation imposes strong natural selection on individuals and populations ofmost animal species, resulting in evolution of antipredator traits thatfacilitate survival. Escape behavior is a particularly interesting component ofany animal’s antipredator syndrome (i.e., the animal’s suite of traits thattogether facilitate survival against predation) because escape often representsthe last line of defense. For example, most animals’ antipredator syndromescomprise multiple predator-avoidance traits, such as altered activity patterns,cryptic or warning coloration and behavior, vigilance, defensive nestconstruction, or chemical defenses. However, for many individuals, thesepredator avoidance mechanisms at some point ultimately fail to prevent the preyanimal from being targeted by a predator for attack (Pinheiro 1996[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.43]). At this point, escape behaviorbecomes a critical determinant of an animal’s survival, and the set of behaviorscomprising “escape” might therefore be predicted to be refined by selection intoa highly context specific and reliably produced sequence of actions.There are a number of ways by which adaptive and effective escape behaviors maybe organized at the individual level, including cultural transmission, learningby experience, innate expression of an entirely genetically determined behavior,and more complex, higher-order modes of transmission in which predator cuesexperienced by the parental generation are translated into developmental cuesthat influence offspring behavior (i.e., adaptive maternal effects). It iscommonly assumed that some combination of these modes of transmission isresponsible for the expression of most adaptive escape behaviors: therequirement that effective escape behaviors must be context specific suggeststhat phenotypic plasticity and incorporation of environmental cues may beimportant influences on the expression of such behaviors. On the other hand,escape behaviors have an immediate life or death outcome, affording limitedopportunity for these behaviors to be shaped by learning or experience,particularly in solitary animals that cannot learn from witnessing attacks onconspecifics. For this reason, it is predicted or assumed that most escapebehaviors are also based on a system of early-developmental or intergenerationaltransmission such as cultural (i.e., non-genetic, horizontal transmission),maternal (i.e., the components of vertical transmission between mothers andoffspring besides direct genetic transmission of traits), or direct geneticmechanisms.Despite the expectation that escape behaviors are modified under naturalselection and controlled by adaptive genetic × environmental interactions (G×E),little is known about how these behaviors are transmitted. This is on one handbecause escape behaviors are higher order traits that rely on underlyingphysiological (Chapter 13 [OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#CN-bp-13]) andmorphological (Chapter 11 [OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_000.xhtml#CN-bp-11])characteristics, which themselves each have complex environmental and geneticbases. On the other hand, lack of a comprehensive understanding of how escapebehavior is transmitted, organized, and refined by selection is likely due tothe scarcity of studies that have tackled this topic. Studies focusing on theevolution of reaction norms for escape behavior are particularly rare. In thischapter, I review studies that have investigated either quantitative genetic ormechanistic bases of escape behavior transmission to synthesize what iscurrently known and point to fruitful future directions for research. Tofacilitate evaluation and future synthesis, many of the reviewed studies aresummarized in Table 14.1 [OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#TBLm-tblw-15].Table 14.1 Summary of reviewed studies that examine the inheritance of escapebehavior.TaxonBehaviorEffectReferenceEstimated heritabilityScallops ArgopectenpurpuratusLatency to fleeh2 = 0.45 ± 0.18Brokordt (2012[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.10])Total number of claps (adductor musclecontractions)h2 = 0.51 ± 0.18Clapping timeh2 = 0.36 ± 0.17Clapping rateh2 = 0.57± 0.18Garter snakes Thamnophis ordinoidesDistance fledh2 = 0.387 ± 0.169 – 0.798± 0.164Brodie (1989 [OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.7], 1993[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.9])Number of reversalsh2 = 0.225 ± 0.110 –0.783 ± 0.184Escape speedh2 = 0.419 ± 0.196 – 1.173 ± 0.163Mamushi snakesGloydius blomhoffiiDistance fledh2 = 0.82 ± 0.47 (hunted site), 0.89 ± 0.50(non-hunted site)Sasaki et al.

In practice, remarkably few studies have directlyestimated the heritability of escape behaviors. Often, heritabilities of escapestrategies are assessed as a component of personality (Chapter 15[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#CN-bp-15]; Sinn et al. 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.61]). Conversely, other studies reportsignificant heritabilities for traits that commonly underlie escape behavior,such as aspects of locomotor performance (Chapter 11[OEBPS_Text_part0025_split_000.xhtml#CN-bp-11]), including sprint speeds andstamina (Garland 1988 [OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.20], Shaffer &Formanowicz 2000 [OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.52], Watkins & McPeek 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.71], Blumstein et al. 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.6]). However, it is often unclear howselection acting on either higher (i.e., personality) or lower order (i.e.,locomotor performance) traits will affect the evolutionary response of escapebehavior itself. Studies that directly estimate escape behavior heritability areoften performed in the laboratory, which minimizes stochastic environmentaleffects on behavior, but which may present an artificial picture of how animalsactually behave in the wild. Two examples in which thorough quantitative geneticanalyses have been carried out are included below as case studies. These arefollowed by a review of other studies providing less complete evidence ofheritable escape behaviors in section 14.3[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#aid-QMFTB].14.2.1 CASE STUDY 1: FLIGHT IN SCALLOPSJuvenile scallops (Argopecten purpuratus) exhibit significant heritabilities forescape behaviors in response to controlled episodes of contact with a sea star,a natural predator (Brokordt et al. 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.10]; Figure 14.1[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#FIGm-fig-94]). Brokordt et al. estimatedheritabilities using offspring of wild-caught (but laboratory-reared) parentsthat were produced in a full/half-sib breeding design. Escape behaviors measuredincluded latency to flee following predator contact, number of claps performedby the scallop during escape (claps = contractions of the phasic adductormuscle, producing valve closings and openings), and the rate and duration ofclapping, which determine the speed and distance of the scallop’s escape effort.Estimated heritabilities were high and significant for all behaviors (Table 14.1[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#TBLm-tblw-15]). In all cases, dam effects were nearzero and non-significant, suggesting that escape is not strongly influenced bymaternal effects in this system. Interestingly, when scallops were subjected toa repeat trial, heritabilities of escape behavior dropped considerably. Althoughbehaviors were repeatable (R = 0.36–0.42), most were no longer significantlyheritable when estimated from repeat performances. This suggests that naïvescallops exhibit innate and genetically based escape abilities that aresubsequently influenced by experience or limiting energetic considerations (onlyfive minutes rest time was allowed between trials).[OEBPS_Images_image00989.jpeg]Figure 14.1Heritable variation in scallop escape behavior (from Brokordt et al. 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.10]). (A) (left to right): Study organism,A. purpuratus. Escape trial arena. Escape trial in action (photo credits:Gabriela Núñez and Manuel Carmona). (B,C) Among-family variation in two of themeasured escape behaviors, clapping rate (rate of contraction of phasic adductormuscle, providing an estimate of escape effort) and latency to flee followingforced contact with a natural predator, a sea star.(Figures reproduced with premission from K. Brokordt unpublished)Escape behaviors in scallops were not only highly heritable, but also exhibitedsignificant genetic correlations with each other: reaction time exhibitedsignificant genetic correlations with clapping time (rG = 0.79 ± 0.21) and withnumber of claps (rG = – 0.74 ± 0.26), suggesting a genetic trade-off betweenfast reaction times and the ability to sustain the escape. Such a trade-offbetween speed and endurance has been commonly proposed (Garland 1988[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.20]), but has not always been reported(Brodie 1993 [OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.9]; Sorci et al. 1995[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.62]). However, genetic correlations betweendifferent components of escape may be common, with some genetic correlationsreflecting trade-offs and constraints, and others reflecting co-evolved suitesof traits that work well together in an integrated escape strategy (see alsosection 14.2.2 [OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#B-sec-121]).14.2.2 CASE STUDY 2: FLIGHT IN GARTER SNAKESGarter snakes have become a model system for investigating the genetics ofescape-related behavior (Arnold & Bennett 1984[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.3]; Garland 1988[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.20]) because they display a diversity ofescape and defensive tactics combined with alternative antipredator markings(Jackson et al. 1976 [OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.26]; Brodie 1989[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.7]), and these traits each appear to bestrongly genetically influenced. Brodie (1989[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.7], 1993[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.9]) calculated heritabilities and geneticcorrelations among escape and other antipredator traits for individual gartersnakes (Thamnophis ordinoides) based on laboratory behavioral trials of naïve,juvenile snakes and full-sib-based analyses of genetic parameters. Althoughfull-sib analyses often conflate genetic and maternal effects, this conflationwas partially removed by regressing behavior scores on potential indicators ofmaternal condition. Maternal effects that do not reflect maternal condition werenot accounted for, however. As in Brokordt et al. (2012[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.10]), significant and substantialheritabilities and genetic correlations were found for all escape andescape-related traits, including distance fled, number of reversals in directionof escape, and escape speed, with estimated heritabilities for escape behaviorsranging from 0.23 to 1.17. The highest and lowest estimates for each escapebehavior’s heritability are reported in Table 14.1[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#TBLm-tblw-15]. Genetic correlations were reportedbetween the number of reversals that a snake performed during flight and itsdorsal patterning in two out of four populations (rG = – 0.328 ± 0.116 – rG = –0.499 [s.e. not reported]). A significant genetic correlation between distancefled and speed was reported in one of the four populations (rG = 0.418 ± 0.111;Brodie 1993 [OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.9]). In contrast with thescallop example above, faster garter snakes also exhibited more prolongedescapes.Heritable variation in escape behavior of garter snakes is likely maintainedunder correlational selection favoring alternative escape syndromes: blotchedsnakes achieve high fitness by performing reversals to aid in crypsis whereasstriped snakes survive best when escaping in a straight line to create anoptical illusion of stasis (Brodie 1992 [OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.8];Figure 14.2A [OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#FIGm-fig-95]; see also section 14.5.1[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#aid-QMG1J]). Homogeneity of escape behavior × dorsalpattern G–matrices across diverged populations also suggests that these traitsmay be related by pleiotropy or linkage in addition to shared selectionpressures (Brodie 1993 [OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.9]) although muchmore work is needed to understand the genomic architecture of escape syndromes.[OEBPS_Images_image00990.jpeg]Figure 14.2Genetic architecture of garter snake escape behavior (from Brodie 1989[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.7], 1993[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.9]). (A) Correlational selection favorsgenetic correlations between dorsal patterning and escape behavior. Blotchedsnakes are selected to perform reversals, facilitating crypsis. Striped snakesare selected to escape in a straight line, facilitating an optical illusion ofreduced speed. Figure reproduced with permission from Brodie (1992[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.8]).

Bottom panel: a striped individual escapes in a straight line(photo by Jim Conrad).14.3 OTHER EVIDENCE FOR GENETIC BASIS OF ESCAPE BEHAVIORSAlthough formal quantitative genetic studies of escape behavior are rare, manystudies present at least partially convincing evidence for genetic bases ofescape behavior. These cover a broad array of taxa, and can be grouped by themethodologies used to infer heritability, from parent-offspring or among-sibcomparisons to artificial selection experiments to population- or species-levelcomparisons. Parent-offspring and full-sib comparisons establish family-leveleffects on escape behavior, although how this genetic component of phenotypicvariation is distributed among maternal, additive, dominance, epistatic, and G ×E effects remains to be determined. Artificial selection studies provide theadditional advantage of supplying evidence for additive effects on escapebehaviors, but these often cannot rule out maternal and grand-maternal effects,and are often conducted in systems so removed from the wild that it is difficultto apply their conclusions to natural systems. Finally, population- andspecies-level comparisons indicate larger scale trends in local adaptation andtrade-offs that can inform future studies of the genetic architectureunderpinning escape.14.3.1 FAMILY EFFECTSMost commonly, familial effects on escape behavior have been detected viafull-sib analysis or parent-offspring correlations under controlled conditions(either cross-fostering or common garden), and these effects may be attributedto either genetic or maternal/environmental effects of parents on progeny. Forinstance, adult, cross-fostered alpine swifts (Apus melba) behaved more liketheir biological parents than their foster parents in response to a simulatedpredator attack, suggesting either genetic or prenatal maternal effects onescape behavior (Bize et al. 2012 [OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.4]).Sasaki et al. (2009 [OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.50]) studied therepeatability and heritability of distance fled in response to human predatorsin the commercially valuable Japanese mamushi snakes (Gloydius blomhoffii),using full-sib comparisons that did not control for maternal effects. They foundthat flight distance exhibited significant family effects in both hunted andnon-hunted populations (Table 14.1 [OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#TBLm-tblw-15]).Alert distance/flight initiation distance (assessed as the distance at which thesnake reacted to a simulated predator by either orienting or fleeing) showed asignificant family effect in garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis), in full-sibcomparisons in lab-reared progeny of wild-caught dams (King 2002[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.27]). King also found significant family ×time and family × time × testosterone interactions, suggesting that the ontogenyof escape behavior and the response of escape behavior to circulating steroidhormones are also either genetically based or subject to strong maternaleffects. This study provides baseline evidence for a heritable set ofenvironmentally modified reaction norms for escape behavior, a mechanism ofinheritance that allows escape responses to be both reliably produced overmultiple generations (i.e., stereotyped) and also suited to current conditions(i.e., individual or maternal experiences of predator regime, habitat, orindividual variation in trade-offs between escape and other activities).In one of the more convincing examples of genetic effects on escape behavior,Evans et al. (2004 [OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.18]) tested for agenetic correlation between bright coloration and effective escape behavior inguppies (Poecilia reticulata) by artificially inseminating females with spermfrom brightly or dully colored males with which the females had not had priorcontact. Artificial insemination prevented females from using male coloration asa signal to trigger maternal effects, while testing the hypothesis thatcoloration is a reliable indicator of male genetic quality (Hill 1991[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.24]). More brightly colored males siredoffspring with better maneuvering ability during escape, and thus longer timesto capture (by a human using a net), suggesting a genetic sire effect on escapebehavior, and a genetic correlation between escape behavior and sexuallyselected coloration (Evans et al. 2004[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.18]).14.3.2 EVIDENCE OF HERITABILITY FROM ARTIFICIALLY SELECTED LINESA response to artificial selection over multiple generations in a controlledenvironment is likely sufficient to dispel all but the most persistent ofconfounding maternal effects, and this methodology has provided some solidevidence of genetic effects on escape behavior. For instance, parthenogenic peaaphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) exhibit variation in their tendency to drop from aperch in response to alarm pheromone emitted by clone-mates. Andrade andRoitberg (1995 [OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.2]) created three to fourgeneration, divergently selected lines for this escape behavior in three clonesof pea aphids, resulting in significant divergence in phenotype in the majorityof cases.In a related study, divergently selected lines of Drosophila melanogasterexhibited phenotypic divergence in distance fled upward through an I-maze awayfrom vibrations imparted to the bottom of the maze (Grant & Mettler 1969[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.21]). Escape behavior that continued todiverge over 18 generations without plateau, and also resulted in a correlatedevolutionary response in assortative mating behavior: individuals selected fornon-fleeing behavior engaged more readily in courtship behavior and were thusmore likely to pair with each other in mating trials. This result suggests thatdivergent selection on escape behavior imposed by predation may be sufficient toestablish partial reproductive isolation. Significant realized heritabilitieswere calculated from these lines (Table 14.1[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#TBLm-tblw-15]). However, due to the highly artificialconditions of the behavioral trials, it is unclear how these results reflecttrue antipredator escape behaviors in a wild context.14.3.3 EVIDENCE FOR HERITABILITY AND LOCAL ADAPTATION FROM POPULATIONCOMPARISONSTo infer local adaptation in escape behaviors, a number of investigators haveexamined the behaviors of lab-reared offspring of wild-caught mothers frompopulations subject to differing predation levels or regimes. Although thesestudies often cannot distinguish between genetic and maternal effects onoffspring escape behaviors, it is possible in controlled rearing conditions tocontrol for the effect of the offspring environment. Such controlled studiesprovide good evidence that at least some components of escape behaviors thatvary among populations are organized before birth. Population comparisonsrepresent the most abundant current evidence for heritability and localadaptation in escape behaviors.Naïve, captive-reared offspring of wild-caught female field crickets (Gryllusinteger) exhibited longer hiding times when their mothers had been captured froma population characterized by a greater diversity of predators than offspringfrom a population with fewer predator species (Hedrick & Kortet 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.23]). Subjects were obtained from twopopulations that differed in the number of predator species present and whichwere sufficiently geographically isolated to prevent high levels of gene flow,and escape behaviors were assessed in a controlled laboratory setting. A similarresult for population level variation in hiding times was reported forlab-reared, F2 desert grass spiders Agelenopsis aperta from habitatscharacterized by differing avian predation intensities (Reichert & Hedrick 1990[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.47]). Breeding to a second generationlimits the influence of single-generation maternal effects, and provides strongevidence of genetic transmission and local adaptation in escape behavior.O’Steen et al. (2002 [OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.40]), Punzo (2007[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.46]), Placyk (2012[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.44]), and Sasaki et al. (2009[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.50]) have provided similar examples ofpopulation-level variation in escape behaviors in guppies, whiptail lizards, andsnakes (Table 14.1 [OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#TBLm-tblw-15]).Population-level comparisons are more convincing when couched in a formalpopulation-genetics framework. Laboratory reared larval salamanders (Ambystomabarbouri) from populations with fish predators present required lower stimulusintensity (number of taps) to initiate flight than naïve larvae from populationsin fishless habitats (Storfer & Sih 1998[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.64]). Furthermore, the number of tapsrequired to initiate escape depended on the degree of genetic isolation of theindividual’s source population from a population not exposed to fish, indicatingthat gene flow constrains local adaptation in escape behaviors. Survival ratesin the presence of a cichlid predator were also higher among individuals frompopulations more genetically isolated from populations not exposed to predationby fish. This example clearly indicates a genetic effect on escape and suggestsa trade-off between escape and some other aspect of performance that is favoredin the absence of predators.Clinal gradients in escape behavior can also indirectly implicate localadaptation over large-scale gradients in selective regimes. Latitudinalgradients in escape behavior, corresponding to decreases in predator densitiesat high latitudes, offer suggestive evidence of adaptive genetic effects onescape behavior in frogs (Laurila et al. 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.31]) and birds (Díaz et al. 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.17]).14.3.4 SPECIES-LEVEL COMPARISONSSpecies-level comparisons offer evidence complementary to that obtained frompopulation-level comparisons, providing insight into the evolution of escapebehavior at macroevolutionary scales. Studies reviewed above suggest that themaintenance of adaptive differences in escape behavior among populations maydepend on low gene flow (Storfer & Sih 1998[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.64]), and, in turn, population-leveldifferences in escape behavior may contribute to reproductive isolation amongpopulations (Grant & Mettler 1969 [OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.21];Nakayama & Miyatake 2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.39]). When anecologically relevant trait such as escape behavior varies among populations andcontributes to reproductive isolation between populations, this trait mayfacilitate or drive ecological speciation and adaptive radiations. The evidencefor effects of divergently selected escape behavior on reproductive isolationamong conspecific populations indicates that escape behavior may drivespeciation dynamics in some systems. In other cases, escape behavior may exhibitphylogenetic and niche conservatism. Phylogenetic conservatism could indicatethat escape behavior is developmentally or ecologically constrained, andstrongly suggests a genetic basis for escape behavior and its correlations andtrade-offs with other traits.In a comparison of three congeneric species of whiptail lizards (Aspidoscelisspp.), two parthenogenic and one gonochoristic, species-level differences inflight initiation distance and other defensive behaviors were reported (Hotchkin& Riveroll 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.25]), consistent with someprevious observations (Milstead 1957 [OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.37];Schall & Pianka 1980 [OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.51]; Price 1992[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.45]). This suggests that escape behaviormight be affected by genetic changes that occur in the transition toparthenogenesis or subsequent loss of genetic variability (Schall & Pianka 1980[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.51]; Paulissen 1998[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.42]) although more evidence is needed toconfirm the cause of variation in escape behavior across these species.Flight initiation distance in four populations from three species of freshwaterfish was inversely correlated with degree of body armor (McLean & Godin 1989[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.35]). The authors argued that thiscorrelation reflects an evolved trade-off between behavioral and morphologicaldefense (see also Abrahams 1995 [OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.1]). Thesestudies rely on relatively few species comparisons and do not consider effectsof phylogeny or divergence times.In a phylogenetically informed comparison of morphological defense and escapebehavior in 15 cordylid lizard species, more heavily armored species ran shorterdistances (distance fled), entered refuges more frequently (proportion ofindividuals that enter refuge), ran more slowly, and were less likely to utilizevertical surfaces during flight (Losos et al. 2002[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.32]). Armor was concluded to be part of anevolved, genetically based antipredator syndrome that involves altered escapebehavior and habitat use. Alternatively, differences in escape behavior could benon-genetic and result from behavioral plasticity producing similar behaviors inthe habitats used by armored species. In general, Losos et al. found thatphylogenetic comparisons provided similar results to non-phylogenetic tests ofescape behavior and correlations with morphology, indicating a high degree ofevolutionary lability. More phylogenetic tests of escape behavior are requiredto complement population-genetic analyses and within-population heritabilityestimates, in order to better understand the genetic architecture andevolutionary potential of escape behavior.14.4 CONCLUSIONS BASED ON CASE STUDIES AND OTHER EVIDENCE OF ESCAPE HERITABILITYThe genetics of escape behavior is currently a neglected field. Very few formalquantitative analyses of escape behavior have been conducted. Even among those,maternal effects are not always effectively excluded (e.g., Brodie, 1993[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.9]), and dominance and epistasis have notyet been addressed. The recent advancements in computationally intensive methodsfor quantitative genetic and genomic analysis within the last decade mean thatsuch studies are now much more feasible. However, most studies to date provideonly partial or equivocal evidence for heritability of escape behavior.Collectively, these studies strongly indicate that escape behavior has a geneticbasis in a wide variety of prey taxa, often exhibits local adaptation, and maybe associated with predictable antipredator syndromes (such as degree ofmorphological defense) or sexual/genetic systems (e.g., parthenogenesis,sexually selected coloration). As predicted, many of these studies indicate thatescape behavior is likely to exhibit evolved plasticity and ontogeneticmodification, and high evolutionary potential.14.5 MATERNAL EFFECTSAdaptive maternal effects are predicted to arise when a female reliablyexperiences one of several different environments, and the environment that sheexperiences also reliably predicts conditions her offspring are likely to face(Mousseau & Fox 1998 [OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.38]). Because predatorregimes often persist at intermediate ecological scales of space and time and/orexhibit cyclical dynamics (May 1972 [OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.33]),escape behaviors are ideal candidates for adaptive maternal modification.Theoretically, maternal effects can reliably produce a range of adaptivebehaviors in offspring according to local cues, in contrast to locally adaptedbehaviors with a strictly genetic basis, which suffer from slower evolutionaryresponses to changing predator regimes, and from gene flow from areas havingdifferent predation regimes (Storfer & Sih 1998[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.64]). Furthermore, adaptive maternaleffects are predicted to appropriately adjust offspring behaviors according tophase of a predator–prey density cycle.Many of the studies on familial effects may be most plausibly interpreted aspartially or substantially due to maternal effects, but convincing evidence islacking. In contrast, studies that specifically address maternal effects onescape behavior do not commonly include a formal quantitative genetic analysisof the maternal contribution to phenotypic variation (VM). Instead,investigators of maternal effects on escape behavior have, to date, more oftenfocused on behavioral and physiological mechanisms, including provisioning,incubation regimes, or other phenotypic interactions between mothers and theirprogeny that may or may not be adaptive. In these studies a combination ofexperimental manipulations and correlative approaches have been employed toidentify specific effects of maternal traits on offspring escape behavior. BelowI review a mechanism of maternal effects on escape behavior, with emphasis on acase study in which the role of maternal effects was assessed bothmechanistically and in a quantitative genetics framework, and the maternaleffect on escape behavior was placed in a broader context of an evolvedcharacter syndrome involving adaptive mating and antipredator strategies.14.5.1 CASE STUDY: EGG SIZE AND ALTERNATIVE PATTERNS OF ADAPTIVE ESCAPE BEHAVIORIN SIDE-BLOTCHED LIZARDSEscape behaviors often exhibit adaptive variation within populations, wherevariation in escape behaviors prevents predators from matching their attackstrategy to a single escape tactic (Schall & Pianka 1980[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.51]). Furthermore, variable escapestrategies are often most effective when paired with other traits that affectthe success of each escape behavior in an integrated, multitrait antipredatorstrategy (e.g., adaptive correlations between particular escape behaviorstrategies and dorsal patterning or body size; Brodie 1989[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.7]; DeWitt et al. 1999[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.16]). Side-blotched lizards (Utastansburiana) exhibit alternative throat colors that indicate alternative matingand reproductive tactics in each sex (Sinervo & Lively 1996[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.59]). Throat color is correlated with eggsize variation, with yellow-throated females laying larger eggs thanorange-throated females (Sinervo et al. 2000[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.60]). This species also exhibits continuousvariation in dorsal patterning, with patterns ranging from longitudinal stripesto horizontal bars (Lancaster et al. 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.28]; Figure 14.3C[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#FIGm-fig-96]). Lancaster et al. (2010[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.30]) found that survival selection favoredtwo alternative trait combinations. Yellow-throated lizards, which exhibit anon-territorial, sneaker strategy in males, survived best with a barred dorsalpattern combined with evasive escape behaviors such as reversals and zigzagsduring flight. This result confirms earlier results that blotched and barredpatterns are often co-selected with cryptic and evasive escape behaviors inreptiles (Jackson et al. 1976 [OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.26]; Brodie1992 [OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.8]; Figure 14.2A[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#FIGm-fig-95]) because this combination of traitsfacilitates crypsis, particularly when escaping into camouflaging vegetation.Territorial orange-throated lizards, in contrast, survived best when exhibitinga striped dorsal pattern and vertical (e.g., jumping, climbing) behaviors. Thesefindings corroborate previous reports that stripes facilitate quick escape bycreating an optical illusion of reduced speed (Brodie, 1992[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.8]; see also section 14.2.2[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#B-sec-121]).[OEBPS_Images_image00991.jpeg]Figure 14.3Effects of egg size on escape behavior (from Lancaster et al. 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.30]). (A) Egg size affects body shape in U.stansburiana. Left panel: regression of egg mass on body shape. Body shape, butnot body size, effects persist throughout life (Figure 3C in original article,reproduced with permission). Right panel: experimental egg size manipulationsalso affect body shape. (B) Egg size effects on body shape direct alternativeescape behaviors: leaner progeny are more likely to exhibit vertical behaviors(left panel), and stockier progeny are more likely to exhibit evasive behaviors(right panel).

(C) Top: effects of eggsize manipulation on offspring body size and shape. Middle: examples of dorsalpattern variation; left = bars, right = stripes. Bottom: circular track forperforming escape behavior trials(Photo 14.3C top: by Barry Sinervo; middle and bottom: by Lesley Lancaster)Adaptive combinations of such disparate traits as mating strategy, dorsalpatterning, and escape behavior are rarely co-organized by a shared geneticpathway, and maternal effect plasticity may adaptively organize alternativecharacter suites where linkage or pleiotropy are lacking (Lancaster et al. 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.28], 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.30]). In side-blotched lizards, dorsalpatterning and mating strategy are each heritable, but not geneticallycorrelated with each other (Lancaster et al. 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.28]), and dorsal patterning is also undermaternal control via yolk estradiol (Lancaster et al. 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.28]). In the context of a half-sib crossingdesign, escape behaviors were measured ten times in succession in all parentsand progeny. Measured escape behaviors included vertical behaviors (number ofjumping + climbing attempts within each trial), evasive behaviors (zigzags +reversals + pauses), hiding behaviors (crouches + burying attempts), and totaldistance fled. Behaviors were repeatable, but heritability was low andnon-significant for all behaviors. However, escape behaviors were significantlyphenotypically correlated with both natural and experimental variation in bodyshape, with “lean” body types more likely to engage in vertical behavior, and“stocky” body types more likely to engage in evasive behavior (Lancaster et al.2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.30]; Figure 14.3B[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#FIGm-fig-96]). Body shape is controlled by egg sizein this and other lizard species (Figure 14.3A[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#FIGm-fig-96]; Sinervo & Huey 1990[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.58]), a maternal effect. Egg size itselfhas both a genetic and environmental basis (Sinervo et al. 2000[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.60]; Lancaster et al. 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.29]). Body shape was experimentallyadjusted via egg size manipulations (Sinervo & Huey 1990[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.58]; Lancaster et al. 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.30]) to confirm that egg size itself, andnot a correlated direct-genetic or maternal effect, was causally responsible forinducing the alternative escape behaviors (Figure 14.3A[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#FIGm-fig-96]). Furthermore, escape behavior wasconfirmed to be under maternal influence in a quantitative genetic analysis,which indicated that the maternal component of phenotypic variation (VM,encompassing variance due to maternal effects and dominance) in progeny escapebehavior was responsible for over a third of the total phenotypic variance(Table 14.1 [OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#TBLm-tblw-15]).This study provides evidence that escape behavior may adaptively linkalternative male and female reproductive strategies. In this study system,orange-throated males are territorial, inhabiting rock outcrops withgood-quality nest sites. Orange-throated females tend to lay small eggs(resulting in lean hatchlings who perform vertical escape behaviors; thesebehaviors are beneficial in a three-dimensional, rocky habitat). Yellow-throatedmales are non-territorial sneakers that spend much of their time in the grass,and yellow-throated females tend to lay large eggs (resulting in stockyoffspring that perform evasive behaviors that are beneficial in thebetween-territory vegetation). In the absence of an egg size effect on escapebehaviors that are alternatively favored in habitats occupied by differentmating strategy types, the genetic correlation between female egg sizestrategies and male mating strategies remains unexplained (egg size does notaffect adult body size, but it does affect adult body shape; Lancaster et al.2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.30]). Similar correlations betweenmating and egg size strategies have been reported in other lizard species(Stapley & Keogh 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.63]), suggesting thatescape behavior may commonly be responsible for observed correlations betweenalternative male mating strategies and female reproductive strategies.14.5.2 ENDOCRINE MECHANISMS OF MATERNAL EFFECTS ON ESCAPE BEHAVIOROne of the most commonly studied ways that females can putatively affect thebehavior of their progeny is by manipulating the prenatal endocrine environment,particularly by varying fetal exposure to steroid hormones. Prenatalglucocorticoid exposure (cortisol or corticosterone, depending on species) is aprime candidate for maternal organization of offspring escape behavior invertebrates. This is because glucocorticoid levels, which function in vertebrateenergy balance, are known to increase under stress and to affect behaviorsrequiring locomotion, such as activity level and dispersal (Dauphin-Villemant &Xavier 1987 [OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.14]; De Fraipont et al. 2000[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.15]). Glucocorticoids and other steroidhormones are easily transferred between mothers and developing offspring via theplacenta or yolk of amniotic eggs (Hayward & Wingfield 2004[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.22]). Therefore glucocorticoids provide aplausible, efficient mechanism by which mothers can communicate informationabout environmental stressors to offspring by using the same hormone thatprovides the cue to direct future offspring behavior (Uller & Olsson 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.69]), e.g., via known effects ofglucocorticoids on energy distribution or muscle development (Chin et al. 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.11]).Following this logic, several researchers have examined the effects ofexperimentally elevated maternal glucocorticoid levels on offspring escapebehavior, mainly using reptilian study systems. Juvenile Lacerta (Zootoca)vivipara lizards from corticosterone-treated mothers exhibited increased latencyto flee (required more stimulation to run) in comparison with offspring ofcontrol females (Meylan & Clobert 2004[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.36]). Also in Z. vivipara, hatchlings fromeggs that were directly injected with corticosterone exhibited significantlylonger hiding times than control individuals (Uller & Olsson 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.69]). In the garter snake Thamnophiselegans, the effects of maternal corticosterone on escape behavior depended onmaternal ecotype (Robert et al. 2009 [OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.48]);specifically, experimentally elevated maternal corticosterone resulted in areduced frequency of reversals in the “lakeshore” ecotype, which ischaracterized by a blotched dorsal pattern and frequent reversals. However,maternal corticosterone treatment had no effect on this behavior in the“mountain meadow” ecotype, which is characterized by stripes and few reversals.Ecotypes of T. elegans are correlated with alternative life-history strategies,and divergent naturally occurring corticosterone blood titers, suggesting thatmaternal effects on escape behavior may be closely tied to alternativelife-history strategies (in addition to alternative mating and reproductivestrategies; see sections 14.3 [OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#aid-QMFTB] and 14.5.1[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#aid-QMG1J]). In each of these studies on maternaleffects of glucocorticoids in reptiles, prenatal exposure to corticosterone wascorrelated with escape strategies involving lower energetic expenditure than inuntreated controls.Other steroid hormones have been investigated for potential maternal effects onescape behavior. Experimental prenatal exposure to androgens (testosteroneinjected into egg yolks) resulted in shorter assessment time and latency to fleein the painted dragon (Ctenophorus pictus), potentially indirectly via an effecton digit ratio (i.e., the relative lengths of individual digits on a singlelimb, which can affect locomotor performance; Tobler et al. 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.66], 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.67]). Contrary to predicted effects ofandrogens on masculinized morphology and higher risk taking, experimentallyelevated yolk testosterone in these studies resulted in a more feminized patternof higher 3D:4D digit length ratios (ratio of the third to fourth digit lengthon a single limb), and a higher 3D:4D ratio was correlated with reducedrisk-taking in escape behavior. In contrast, experimentally elevated yolkandrogens (testosterone and androstenedione) resulted in the predicted patternof increasingly risky escape behaviors in male pied flycatchers (Ficedulahypoleuca), which exhibited a decreased tendency to flee (~proportion that flee)(Ruuskanen & Laaksonen 2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.49]).The mechanism by which females increase offspring prenatal exposure to androgensin response to environmental cues is unknown, and likely involves a more complexphysiological basis than glucocorticoid-based maternal effects, which can betransmitted as a passive response to maternal stress. Once androgens have beentransferred to offspring, their effects on escape behavior are predicted toarise as downstream organizational effects on brain development, leading toincreased overall levels of risk taking and aggressiveness (Partecke & Schwabl2008 [OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.41]). However, as Tobler et al. (2012[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.67]) demonstrate, the effects of androgenson escape are often unpredictable and may have a more complex basis, includingthe aromatization of testosterone to estradiol by developing progeny (Crews etal. 1995 [OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.12]). The potential effects ofother (steroidal and non-steroidal) maternally derived hormones on escapebehavior are currently unknown, with the exception of some preliminary evidencefor no effect of maternal estradiol (Lancaster et al. 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.30]).14.5.3 OTHER MATERNAL PROVISIONING EFFECTS ON ESCAPE BEHAVIORIn addition to hormones, females provision offspring with varying quantities andqualities of many other nutrients and chemical cues that may have adaptive orincidental effects on offspring escape behavior. For instance, egg sizeinfluences escape behavior in side-blotched lizards via allometric body shapeeffects (section 14.5.1 [OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#aid-QMG1J]). Egg size islikely to commonly affect escape behavior in other species via its effect onoffspring size because escape decisions are often size dependent (Wahle 1992[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.70], Shine et al. 1997[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.56], DeWitt et al. 1999[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.16]). In addition to quantity of maternalprovisioning, quality of provisioning may affect escape behaviors. Thelong-chain fatty acid content of eggs was correlated with offspring escapebehaviors in red drum fish (Sciaenops ocellatus) although egg size itself had noeffect (Fuiman & Ojanguren 2011 [OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.19]).Long-chain fatty acids are usually associated with a high-quality diet and areimportant for nervous system function in vertebrates (Tocher 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.68]). Of 33 fatty acids tested, ten hadsignificant effects on escape behavior. Effects were complex: some behaviorswere influenced by multiple fatty acids, others by a single fatty acid type. Insome cases, different fatty acids had opposing effects on the same escapevariable. Understanding the generality and mechanisms of these effects willrequire further investigation.Maternal investment in carotenoids represents an additional route by whichfemales might increase offspring performance by increasing egg quality.Carotenoids are important in preventing damage due to oxidative stress and, likelong-chain fatty acids, are obtained from high-quality diets (Sies 1997[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.57]). Carotenoids are commonly invested ineggs (and are responsible for yellow yolk pigmentation), resulting in increasedegg quality (Blount et al. 2002 [OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.5]).However, carotenoid supplementation of laying females did not affect offspringescape behavior in the grey partridge, Perdix perdix (Cucco et al. 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.13]).The putative link between compositional quality of eggs and escape behaviorprobably reflects an effect of provisioning on the overall condition and qualityof offspring, with well-provisioned offspring better able to performenergetically costly or neurologically complex escape behaviors. Whether thequality of prenatal provisioning is in general an important contributor toeffective escape performance is unknown. Furthermore, most studies of maternalprovisioning effects have been conducted in egg-laying species, whereprovisioning is more easily quantified and characterized. In placental animals,the time interval available for prenatal provisioning is often more prolongedthan in oviparous species. Therefore variation in the quantity and quality ofresources provided by placental dams may reflect a broader range of conditionsexperienced by the mother. Although prenatal provisioning is more difficult toassess in placental species, such a study would provide a valuable comparison toexisting information on egg-laying species.14.5.4 INCUBATION REGIMES AND MATERNAL CAREIncubation conditions, with or without maternal care, can affect escape behaviorin reptiles. Nest site choice and incubation behaviors can introduce widevariation in the temperatures experienced by developing offspring, andincubation temperature has major effects on hatching time, offspring size,shape, sex, and behavior (Shine & Harlow 1996[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.55]). Maternal choice of incubationtemperature may be adaptively influenced by environmental cues, includingpredator density or predator type. Under natural selection, incubationtemperature may be incorporated as a cue for offspring to develop appropriateescape strategies in response to the environment experienced by their mothers.Alternatively, variation in incubation temperature may have neutral ormaladaptive effects on escape behavior if developmental conditions aresuboptimal for neurological and musculoskeletal development.Shine et al. (1997 [OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.56]) investigated theeffects of incubation regime on the amount of stimulation required by neonatalwater pythons (Liasis fuscus) to sustain flight from a human predator throughthe water. Females exhibited alternative incubation strategies, choosing eitherto lay in varanid lizard burrows with hot, stable temperatures not requiringfurther attendance or to lay eggs in tree root boles having lower, more variabletemperatures that require maternal attendance and shivering thermogenesis tomaintain adequate incubation temperatures. Lab-reared hatchlings from eggsincubated in thermal regimes simulating (hot, stable) varanid burrow nestsrequired more stimulation to sustain flight than hatchlings reared in conditionssimulating (cooler, variable) tree bole nests, with or without maternalattendance. In contrast, hatchlings reared under root bole nest conditions, butwithout maternal attendance, exhibited increased vertical behaviors.Incubation regimes reflecting natural variation in burrow depth affected escapebehavior in a tropical natricine snake, the keelback, Tropidonophis mairii (Webbet al. 2001 [OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.72]). Constant temperaturesfound in deep nests resulted in more pauses during flight, but a decreasedtendency to hide, in comparison to the behavior of hatchlings incubated at thevariable temperatures of shallow nests. The fitness consequences of offspringescape behaviors resulting from variation in incubation regimes, and whetherthese putative effects on offspring fitness have influenced the evolution ofmaternal incubation decisions, are unknown.Shine (1995 [OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.53]) investigated effects ofincubation temperatures that mimic external nests vs. maternal body temperaturein two oviparous scincid lizard species that are members of lineages in whichviviparity has evolved. He found that cooler, nest-equivalent incubationtemperatures resulted in hatchlings displaying more frequent reversals anddefensive behaviors during flight. However, it is unknown whether the prenataleffects of maternal body temperature on offspring escape behavior arebeneficial, or if they are involved in selection for viviparity.14.5.5 MATERNAL ENVIRONMENT AND CONDITION EFFECTS WITH UNKNOWN MECHANISMSSeveral effects of maternal environment or condition on offspring escapebehavior have been identified, but operate by unknown mechanisms. In a clear-cutexample of a maladaptive maternal effect based on maternal experience, femalethree-spine sticklebacks that were exposed to predators produced offspring thatwere less likely to orient to the same predator type, and were therefore morelikely to be eaten (McGhee et al. 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.34]). Conversely, female fall crickets(Gryllus pennsylvanicus) that were exposed to predators while gravid producedoffspring with longer hiding times, which led to higher survival rates in thepresence of predators (Storm & Lima 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.65]).Maternal condition can also affect offspring escape behavior. For example, inthe viviparous scincid lizard Pseudemoia pagenstecheri, offspring from femalesmaintained with restricted food intake were more likely to perform reversalsduring escape, a behavior that was never seen in offspring from well-fed mothers(Shine & Downes 1999 [OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#REFe-r-14.54]). The adaptivesignificance of this maternal effect is unknown.14.5.6 CONCLUSIONS ABOUT MATERNAL EFFECTSMaternal effects on escape behavior have been reported in diverse taxa, albeitprimarily in oviparous vertebrates. They operate by a wide variety ofmechanisms, from effects of maternal behavior, experience, and condition tospecific physiological effects of temperature and maternal provisioning. Morestudies are needed addressing the fitness effects of maternal effects on escapebehavior in order to better discern adaptive maternal effects from maladaptiveor neutral consequences of suboptimal prenatal and rearing conditions. More workis needed on viviparous vertebrates and invertebrates to complement existingstudies, and to understand the generality of and interactions among differentpotential maternal effect mechanisms.14.6 GENERAL CONCLUSIONSEvidence for a genetic basis or other prenatal organization of escape behaviorhas accumulated for diverse prey (Figure 14.4[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#FIGm-fig-97]; Table 14.1[OEBPS_Text_part0028.xhtml#TBLm-tblw-15]) although data on invertebrates andmammals are sparse or lacking. One of the more interesting generalizations fromfindings to date is that escape behavior is often correlated with other aspectsof an organism’s biology, including mating and reproductive strategies, lifehistory, sexually selected coloration, genetic systems, and morphology. Thesecorrelations suggest that escape behavior is often highly integrated with otheraspects of an organism’s biology, and that its heritability and mechanisms oftransmission are strongly influenced and constrained by other, oftennon-predation related, traits. That escape behavior is often highly integratedwith other traits also indicates its potential for use as an easily assessedindicator of the organism’s overall behavioral syndrome.[OEBPS_Images_image00992.jpeg]Figure 14.4Summary of the current representation in the literature of studies examining thetransmission of escape behavior, where each wedge represents the proportion oftotal papers reviewed: (A) by taxon; and (B) by mechanism. Studies wereidentified by searching Web of Science for combinations of the keywords andphrases: “maternal effect/s,” “escape behavior/our,” “antipredatorbehavior/our,” “heritable/ility,” “selection,” and “genetic/s,” and searchingwithin cited articles and articles that cite keyword search results.The literature reviewed here also testifies to the breadth of genetic, maternal,and environmental mechanisms that can affect various components of escapebehavior. Overall, it confirms that escape behavior is subject to a wide rangeof influences affecting development, reflecting the dependence of variation inneurological and musculoskeletal development on the concerted action of a widevariety of underpinning genetic and physiological mechanisms. Because escapebehavior is complex, many influences can potentially affect its effectivenessand/or adaptively direct its development. Further comparative studies are neededto determine how these trait associations evolve, and how escape isdevelopmentally or ecologically constrained.More research is needed to determine the generality of each of these mechanisms,to understand the genetic architecture of escape behavior evolution and toidentify the evolutionary potential of escape behavior given correlations andtrade-offs with other traits. Investigating the role of escape behavior inshaping macroevolutionary processes of speciation, facilitating niche evolution,and interacting with evolving sexual and genetic systems may prove fruitful.Further research is also needed to test for G × E interactions and specificgenetic mechanisms that facilitate adaptive plasticity of escape behavior.Modern molecular ecological methods for identification of quantitative-traitloci (QTL), patterns of genome-wide association (GWA), and loci for adaptivetraits in a landscape genetic framework are likely to be useful in determiningmaternal and genetic effects on escape behavior.REFERENCESAbrahams, M.

Such inter-individual variation maybe adaptive and represent different behavioral strategies (reviewed in Dall etal. 2004 [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.23]; Bell 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.2]; Réale et al. 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.54]; Smith & Blumstein 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.65]; Dingemanse & Wolf 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.25]). In behavioral and evolutionaryecology, the suites of behavioral traits with consistent individual differencesacross situations and contexts, or functional behavioral categories (e.g.,foraging, social interactions, avoiding predators, etc.), are known as“behavioral syndromes” (Sih et al. 2004a[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.62],b[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.63]; Sih & Bell 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.60]) or “animal personalities” (Dall et al.2004 [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.23]; Groothuis & Carere 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.29]; Carere & Maestipieri 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.11]). In the past they were also referredto as temperament, coping styles, or coping strategies (Boissy 1995[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.8]; Wechsler 1995[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.72]; Koolhaas et al. 1999[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.38]). Animal personalities have underlyinggenetic and physiological mechanisms (Koolhaas et al. 1999[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.38]; Van Oers et al. 2004a[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.69]), may be heritable (Van Oers et al.2004b [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.70]; Bell 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.3]) and have fitness consequences (Smith &Blumstein 2008 [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.65]).We review individual differences in escape and hiding responses, and ask how theevolution of different personalities (i.e., the coexistence of differentbehavioral types in a population) is compatible with the theoretical predictionof a single optimal escape or hiding behavior response. Most work on personalityin animals has focused on laboratory and field studies, considering variation inbehaviors such as exploration, neophobia, and risk taking (reviewed in Sih etal. 2004a [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.62],b[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.63]; Bell 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.2]; Réale et al. 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.54]). Particularly, escape responses andhiding behavior have often been used to characterize the personality of severalanimals (e.g., Sih et al. 2003 [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.61]; Lópezet al. 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.42]; Hedrick & Kortet 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.30], 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.31]; Cooper 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.17]; Carter et al. 2012a[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.14],b[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.15]). Individuals that escape earlier frompredators or spend longer times hidden in refuges can be considered as “shy”individuals. By contrast, “bold” individuals delay escape for longer or haveshorter hiding times. However, the concept of personality or a behavioralsyndrome does not imply a simple dichotomy of behavioral types (e.g., proactivevs. reactive or shy vs. bold), but very often there is a continuousdistributionof behavioral types and we should view personalities as existingalong a continuum.15.2 IS ESCAPE BEHAVIOR A PERSONALITY TRAIT?Behavioral syndromes or personalities were described as suites of correlatedbehaviors, with individual consistent differences being expressed in differentbehaviors in different situations and contexts (Sih et al. 2004a[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.62],b[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.63]). A formal statistical definition,which has recently been proposed, suggests that mixed-effect statistical modelscan be applied to estimate a suite of between- and within-individual variancecomponents of behavior (Dingemanse & Dochtermann 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.24]; see also Garamszegi & Herczeg 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.28]). Thus personalities could beidentified if there is consistent repeatability in the inter-individualdifferences between individuals. In other words, if the degree to which abehavioral trait differs between individuals (i.e., between individual variance)is greater than the degree to which a single observation differs from anindividual’s mean (i.e., within-individual variance). Repeatability representsthe phenotypic variation attributable to differences between individuals, whichis of key importance because it provides a standardized estimate ofindividuality that can be compared across studies. However, individuals can beconsistent in their responses but also be plastic and change their responsesbetween situations following behavioral reaction norms (Nusey et al. 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.51]; Biro & Stamps 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.6]; Dingemanse et al. 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.27]; see Figure 15.1[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#FIGm-fig-98]). In that case, mixed-effect modelsallow the statistical definition of personality and plasticity as behavioralreaction norm intercepts and slopes respectively. When intercepts of thesereaction norms differ between individuals in different situations, but slopesdid not differ between individuals, we still could talk of personalitiesmaintained across different situations. In addition, we can statistically definebehavioral syndromes as non-zero between-individual correlations acrossbehavioral attributes (Dingemanse & Dochtermann 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.24]).[OEBPS_Images_image00993.jpeg]Figure 15.1Consistency and plasticity in the escape response. Four hypothetical reactionnorms of flight initiation distance (FID) responses of several individuals undertwo risk level situations. (a) The average FID increases when risk is high(plasticity) but there are not consistent personality differences betweenindividuals. (b) The average FID response does not change between risk levels(no plasticity), and there is no consistency in the responses of the sameindividuals between risk levels. (c) The FID increases similarly in allindividuals (plasticity), and the rank order differences between individuals(personality) is maintained consistently in both risk levels. (d) There are nochanges in FID between risk levels (no plasticity) but there are consistentinter-individual differences in personality across risk levels.(Adapted from Nussey et al. 2007 [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.51])Consider flight initiation distance (FID). We can imagine four differentscenarios (Figure 15.1 [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#FIGm-fig-98]). On the onehand, individuals may react in a similar way to different risk levels and theaverage FID of the population may not change between risk levels (i.e., noplasticity; Figure 15.1b [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#FIGm-fig-98],d[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#FIGm-fig-98]), but we will have differentpersonalities if the variance of the FID responses of the same individual isconsistently lower than the variance in FID between individuals (i.e.,individuals differ in intercepts but not in slopes of the reaction norm; Figure15.1d [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#FIGm-fig-98]). We will not find differentpersonalities if there are not consistent inter-individual differences in FID(Figure 15.1b [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#FIGm-fig-98]). On the other hand,individuals may be sensitive and plastic and change their escape responsesaccording to risk levels (Figure 15.1a [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#FIGm-fig-98],c[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#FIGm-fig-98]), but they will still show differentpersonalities in FID if the rank order differences between individuals ismaintained consistently in both risk levels (i.e., individuals differ inintercepts but not in slopes; Figure 15.1c[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#FIGm-fig-98]). Finally, individuals may be plasticand change their FID between risk levels, but with a lack of consistentpersonality differences between individuals (i.e., individuals differ in slopes;Figure 15.1a [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#FIGm-fig-98]).Therefore if escape and hiding behavior were personality traits, we shouldexpect that individuals differed consistently in their responses. However,individuals may show plasticity in different situations (e.g., different risklevels) while maintaining their personality rank in their responses. Moreover,when escaping from predators, bolder individuals might be also expected to showa behavioral syndrome and be bolder in other contexts, such as in conspecificagonistic interactions, foraging, etc. Although these predictions, and theexistence of shy–bold escape syndromes, have been rarely tested specifically, wewill review the evidence from several personality studies that have used escapeand hiding behavior, or related antipredatory behaviors.15.2.1 CONSISTENCY IN THE ESCAPE AND HIDING RESPONSESTo demonstrate individual repeatability, one must study the same subjectrepeatedly. However, relatively few studies have tested for repeatability ofescape behavior in the same individuals in different situations. This is becausemost studies of escape behavior use independent observations (i.e., differentindividuals) in different treatments. Also, in most cases, measuring escapebehavior requires simulating predatory attacks toward the tested animal. Thusmost studies used different individuals to avoid the problem of habituation (seebelow) or sensitization, where animals decrease or increase, respectively, themagnitude of their subsequent responses to repeated risk situations. However, itwould be possible to use a reaction norm approach (Biro & Stamps 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.6]; Dingemanse & Dochtermann 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.24]), whereby, by testing individualsrepeatedly, it is possible to study both the slope and the intercept of theirescape responses and determine whether there are consistent personalitydifferences in responses across situations (see above, Figure 15.1[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#FIGm-fig-98]).One study examined whether reliable individual differences in boldness occur inseveral aspects of escape and hiding behavior in the striped plateau lizard,Sceloporus virgatus (Cooper 2009 [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.17]).Repeated measures of FID were positively correlated in several tests, indicatingthat individual differences in boldness were consistent in different situationsand over intervals of a few minutes to a day or longer. A similar result wasobserved for distance fled. Hiding times of the same individuals (two repeatedobservations in different situations) were correlated in some tests where risklevel changed (approach speed, directness, and predator proximity), but not inother tests where risk (successive approaches) or costs levels changed (presenceof food outside the refuge; Cooper 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.17], 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.18]). In this case, the latter result couldbe explained by uncontrolled differences between trials or small effect sizes.Namibian rock agamas, Agama planiceps, have FIDs that are highly consistentwithin individuals (between 9 and 15 repeated measures) over a period of almost50 days, and across situations (seasons). Also, there is more variation in FIDbetween than within individuals, independently of other covariates such as bodymass, temperature, and time of day (Carter et al. 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.13], 2012a[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.14],b[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.15]; Figure 15.2[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#FIGm-fig-99]).[OEBPS_Images_image00994.jpeg]Figure 15.2Consistency between seasons in the flight initiation distance (FID) of Namibianrock agamas, Agama planiceps. Each point represents an observation of anindividual that was observed on multiple occasions in each season. Each linerepresents each individual’s best linear unbiased predictor for the intercept.(Figure redrawn from Carter et al. 2012b[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.15]; photograph by J. Martín)Similarly, within-individual repeatability in FID is very high in burrowingowls, Athene cunicularia, after controlling for several confounding effects(sex, territory). Furthermore, most individuals do not change their escaperesponses, and there are as many birds decreasing as increasing their FIDsacross successive trials (Carrete & Tella 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.12]; Figure 15.3[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#FIGm-fig-100]). In contrast, in yellow-belliedmarmots, Marmota flaviventris, individual identity is not a significantpredictor of FID (Runyan & Blumstein 2004[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.58]). This negative result is probablyexplained by the very different situational contexts in which individuals wereobserved in different occasions.[OEBPS_Images_image00995.jpeg]Figure 15.3Consistency in the flight initiation distance (FID) of burrowing owls, Athenecunicularia. (a) Individual changes of FID across successive trials, for severalindividuals tested four or more times. (b) Percentage change in FID between thelast and the first trial.(Figure redrawn from Carrete & Tella 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.12])In the field cricket, Gryllus integer, individual differences in latency tobecome active after defensive freezing and in hiding time inside a refuge areconsistent (Hedrick & Kortet 2012 [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.31];Niemelä et al. 2012a [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.49]). However,individual differences in boldness are consistent only in a novel environment(control) but not after being exposed to a predator, which suggests theexistence of a context-specific behavioral syndrome (Niemelä et al. 2012b[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.50]). Moreover, hiding time is repeatableacross metamorphosis stages in females, but not in males, which become shyerwith maturation, probably because of the risk associated with calling for mates.Also, individuals have longer freezing times when they are nymphs than when theyare adults (Hedrick & Kortet 2012 [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.31]).In hermit crabs, Coenobita clypeatus, latency to hide and emerge from theirshells are highly consistent in several contexts (i.e., when crabs wereinverted, or in an open field, or when subjected to a predator visual stimulus,or to an electric shock). Moreover, there are correlations between the hidingtime after suffering an electric shock and both the latency to hide and hidingtime after presenting a visual predator stimulus (Watanabe et al. 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.71]). Similar individual consistency inhiding or tonic immobility responses is also found, for example, in other hermitcrab species, Pagurus bernhardus (Briffa et al. 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.10]), mealworm beetles, Tenebrio molitor(Krams et al. 2014 [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.39]), larvalsalamanders, Ambystoma barbouri (Sih et al. 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.61]), and even in sea anemones (Actiniaequina; Briffa & Greenaway 2011 [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.9];Condylactis gigantea; Hensley et al. 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.33]).Taken together, these studies suggest that escape and hiding behavior may beconsistent repeatable personality traits in many animals, at least in somecontexts or during some ontogenetic states. In fact, the reported repeatabilityvalues for FID and hiding times are in many cases among the highestrepeatabilities observed for behaviors (Réale et al. 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.54]; Bell et al. 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.5]).15.2.2 PLASTICITY AND HABITUATION OF THE ESCAPE AND HIDING RESPONSEDespite demonstrable individual consistent differences, animals may also modifytheir behavior to varying environmental conditions (Dingemanse et al. 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.27]). This behavioral plasticity could beeither similar among individuals, hence maintaining personality differencesacross an environmental gradient, or vary among individuals and situations(Nussey et al. 2007 [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.51]; Dingemanse et al.2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.27]; Figure 15.1[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#FIGm-fig-98]). Several studies have revealed thatboth behavioral plasticity and consistency between situations often coexist. Forexample, larval salamanders, Ambystoma barbouri, spend more time out of theirrefuges in the absence of a fish predator than when it is present, butindividual responses are correlated between the two situations (Sih et al. 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.61]). Similarly, hermit crabs, Pagurusbernhardus, show variation in average startle hiding behavior responses betweenseveral predator-cue treatments, indicating that there is behavioral plasticitybetween situations, but crabs also show a high individual consistency in theranks of individual hiding times between situations (Briffa et al. 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.10]).Habituation to predators is a special case of behavioral plasticity by whichanimals reduce their antipredator responses to a potential predatory stimulusthrough a process in which the stimulus ceases to be regarded as dangerous afterrepeated non-threatening exposures to it (e.g., Hemmi & Merkle 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.32]; Rodríguez-Prieto et al. 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.56], 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.57]). Habituation to low-risk predators isimportant because it may have fitness consequences. For example, individualIberian wall lizards, Podarcis hispanica, that habituate (i.e., decrease theirFID) more readily to a frequent low-risk predatory stimulus (a human, that doesnot attack, but passes by close to the lizard) are able to increase their bodycondition more than lizards that habituate less (Rodríguez-Prieto et al. 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.56]; Figure 15.4[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#FIGm-fig-101]).[OEBPS_Images_image00996.jpeg]Figure 15.4Inter-individual variation in habituation in Iberian wall lizards, Podarcishispanica. Relationship between habituation index (higher values indicate ahigher and quicker reduction of FID over the course of a six-day experiment withrepeated approaches) and (a) exploration behavior (higher values indicate fastexplorers) or (b) body condition change.(Redrawn from Rodríguez-Prieto et al. 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.56], 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.57])Several studies have used the progressive reduction in magnitude of FID inresponse to repeated predatory attacks as a measurable indicator of habituation(Lord et al. 2001 [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.43]; Runyan & Blumstein2004 [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.58]; Magle et al. 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.45]; Hemmi & Merkle 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.32]; Rodríguez-Prieto et al. 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.56], 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.57]; Carter et al. 2012b[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.15]). For example, one study investigatedthe direct and indirect effects of boldness (estimated from refuge use, timebeing exposed, etc.), exploratory behavior in a novel environment andsociability (time spent hidden in a refuge with conspecific olfactory cues) onthe inter-individual variability in habituation ability (i.e., reduction in FID)of Iberian wall lizards (Rodríguez-Prieto et al. 2011[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.57]; Figure 15.4[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#FIGm-fig-101]). Individual boldness was consistentacross contexts, but it did not affect differences in habituation. However,exploration had a strong direct effect on habituation, with more exploratoryindividuals being able to habituate faster than less exploratory ones, probablybecause they could gather more information from novel stimuli and were able toassess risk better. Individual variation in habituation was also indirectlyaffected by sociability, probably because less social individuals that avoidedrefuges with conspecific cues, increased exposure to the predator and eventuallyhabituated.In contrast, repeated observation of escape behavior of different individualmale rock agamas revealed a small, but significant, decline in FID with time,which suggests habituation to the observer’s approaches over the course of thestudy. However, individuals do not differ in the rate of habituation, whichsuggests that there are not inter-individual differences in behavioralplasticity (Carter et al. 2012a [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.14],b[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.15]).15.2.3 CORRELATIONS OF ESCAPE AND HIDING BEHAVIOR WITH OTHER BEHAVIORAL TRAITSInter-individual variability in escape responses and hiding behavior frompredators may be correlated with other personality traits such as activity leveland exploration, thus providing strong evidence for a behavioral syndrome. Forexample, juvenile convict cichlids, Amatitlania nigrofasciata, that are moreexploratory in a novel environment are slower to react to an attack by asimulated fish predator (Jones & Godin 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.36]). Similarly, great tits, Parus major,which are more willing to explore more of a novel environment, are also morelikely to return to forage quicker after being startled (Van Oers et al. 2004b[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.70]). And individual chaffinches, Fringillacoelebs, which are less active, are more likely to freeze than flee in responseto a hawk attack and take longer to resume activity after the attack (Quinn &Cresswell 2005b [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.53]). These syndromes couldbe explained by models of optimal escape behavior (Ydenberg & Dill 1986[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.77]; Cooper & Frederick 2007b[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.20]; see Chapter 2[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#CN-bp-2]), with bolder, more exploratory individualsdelaying their escape response and shortening hiding times to reduce the costsof missed foraging opportunities. Alternatively, consistent with the “perceptuallimits hypothesis” (Quinn & Cresswell 2005a[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.52]), individual prey differing inpersonality might have a different capacity to detect and react to predatorattacks. Nevertheless, the latter may be tested in species that show alertresponses before fleeing by looking at variation and consistency in alertdistances.Other studies have found a relationship between boldness toward predators andaggressive behavior toward conspecifics, although only in some populations ofthe same species but not in others (Huntingford 1976[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.34]; Riechert & Hedrick 1993[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.55]; Bell 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.1]). For example, individual breedingthree-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, with higher levels ofterritorial aggression to intruders, are bolder toward a predator outside thebreeding season (Huntingford 1976 [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.34]). Inthe spider Agelenopsis aperta, following a web disturbance that makes them hide,individuals that return more quickly to a foraging position at the funnelentrance of their webs are later more likely to win conspecific agonisticcontests than spiders with longer return latencies (Riechert & Hedrick 1993[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.55]). Male turtles, Mauremsy leprosa, thatare bold in an antipredatory situation (i.e., with shorter hiding times insidethe shell) avoid water with chemicals of unfamiliar competitor males, but notwith chemicals of familiar males, whereas shy turtles avoid chemicals of bothfamiliar and unfamiliar males (Ibañez et al. 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.35]). Bold individuals with respect tosocial interactions might also be bold under threatening situations because ofhigh testosterone levels (Huntingford 1976[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.34]; Tulley & Huntingford 1988[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.68]). This may reflect a trade-off causedby the existence of behavioral correlations across functional contexts (Sih etal. 2003 [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.61]) because different traits havethe same underlying physiological and genetic bases as pleiotropic effects ofthe same genes, which may not be necessarily adaptive in the context of predatoravoidance. However, population comparisons and experimental work have shown thatboldness and aggressiveness tend to covary in “high-predation” populations,where exposure to predation would generate this behavioral syndrome (Bell 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.1]; Dingemanse et al. 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.26]). One experimental study withsticklebacks, suggests that this relationship may be explained because whilebolder individuals more willing to forage under predation risk are less likelyto survive predation, those individuals that are more aggressive towardconspecifics are more likely to survive exposure to predators (Bell & Sih 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.4]), suggesting that this correlationbetween boldness and aggression may be adaptive in some environments.However, boldness to predators is not necessarily correlated with boldness inother contexts. For example, in juvenile pumpkinseed sunfish, Lepomis gibbosus,individual consistent differences in responses to a threatening object do notcorrelate with individual consistent differences in response to a novel foodsource (Coleman & Wilson 1998 [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.16]).Similarly, dumpling squids, Euprymna tasmanica, that are bold in threat testswere not necessarily bold in feeding tests, and this lack of across-contextcorrelations is observed across their entire life span (Sinn et al. 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.64]). These results suggest that shynessand boldness are context specific and may not exist as only a one-dimensionalbehavioral continuum, even within a single context. It is also possible that thelack of correlation tells us that responses to novel, non-threatening stimuli(neophobia) are not equivalent to responses to threatening predators orconspecifics.15.3 EVOLUTION OF PERSONALITIES AND THE OPTIMAL ESCAPE BEHAVIORThe economic or optimality models of escape and refuge use (Ydenberg & Dill 1986[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.77]; Cooper & Frederick 2007a[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.19],b[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.20]; see Chapter 2[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#CN-bp-2]) do not explicitly consider inter-individualdifferences in personality. Such individual differences in boldness and othertraits are a potentially important, but mostly neglected, source of variabilityin these antipredatory behaviors. The problem that arises is that if thesemodels predict only one optimal escape response for each situation of risks andcosts, we should initially expect that all individuals in the population willevolve to uniformly follow this optimal response. This is because individualsthat fail to escape adequately from predators will incur higher predation risk,but individuals that have an exaggerated escape response will incur high costsin the form of missed foraging opportunities. Therefore natural selection wouldquickly favor individuals that show an optimal response (i.e., the one predictedby the models for each situation), and we should not expect to findinter-individual differences but rather a uniform escape strategy in allindividuals of each population.One possibility is that the optimality models are predicting what might be theaverage optimal response in each population, with observed differences beingconsidered as the non-biologically important consequence of inaccuratemeasurements or small random non-adaptive variation around the adaptive mean(Wilson 1998 [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.73]). However, this does notexclude the fact that selection should eliminate those individuals withsuboptimal responses. This would lead to uniform behavior after some timebecause survivors would be only those showing the single optimal response.Other explanations for the existence of consistent inter-individual variabilityin personalities may be the existence of individual differences in state orlife-history strategies (Dall et al. 2004[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.23]; Wolf et al. 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.74]; Biro & Stamps 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.6]; Sih & Bell 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.60]; Luttberg & Sih 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.44]). Thus predictions of the models wouldapply separately to each individual because there is also variability in riskassessment (e.g., based on its escape abilities or life-history strategy) andcosts of escape or refuge use (e.g., individuals with a better condition willhave lower costs). These subtle differences in state or life-history strategiesbetween individuals, which are not easy to measure, would explain the observedinter-individual variability in escape responses in apparently similarsituations. We will expand and examine the empirical evidence for thesehypotheses below.15.3.1 STATE-DEPENDENT ESCAPE AND HIDING RESPONSESMathematical models suggest that among several state-dependent mechanisms, assetprotection (i.e., individuals with more “assets” tend be more cautious) andstarvation avoidance can explain short-term consistency in personality (Wolf etal. 2007 [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.74], 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.75]), although not long-term stablepersonalities (McElreath et al. 2007 [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.48]).However, state-dependent safety (i.e., individuals with higher energy reserves,condition, or health are better at avoiding predators) can explain long-termstable differences in personality (Luttberg & Sih 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.44]). Therefore each individual would beoptimizing its escape responses according to their own state and circumstances.In fact, many studies have shown that morphological and physiological factors,such as running speed, body weight, growth rates, tail loss, or health state,affect the escape responses and refuge use in many animals (Lindström et al.2003 [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.41]; López et al. 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.42]; Biro & Stamps 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.6]; Jones et al. 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.37]; Cooper & Wilson 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.21]). Moreover, many of these state factorsare permanent or of long-term duration in an individual, which will explainbehavioral consistency through time, and their effects will be expressed acrossdifferent contexts and correlated with other different behaviors, which in turnwill result in behavioral syndromes (Dall et al. 2004[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.23]). Therefore differences in thepersonality of escape behavior between otherwise apparently similar individualscan also be considered as adaptive.Some studies support that inter-individual differences in escape behavior mayreflect differences in state-dependent personalities between individuals. Forexample, when approached by skuas, Catharacta spp., unguarded old chinstrappenguin, Pygoscelis antarctica, chicks flee short distances and usuallyaggregate into a dense pack, which decreases individual predation risk. There isan apparently clear variability in the escape responses of different individualchicks under similar conditions. Some shy individuals flee sooner than othersand even some bold individuals do not flee at all but remain still and face theapproaching skua, threatening it with open bill and loud vocalizations (Martínet al. 2006 [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.47]). This variability might berelated to the perceived vulnerability to predation of each individual chick.Simulated predatory attacks showed that inter-individual variability in escapebehavior is partly explained by the social environment (i.e., the presence ofsome adults around that are able to deter a skua attack) and age (younger chicksdo not escape because their parents are usually around to defend them). But inaddition, chicks in relatively poor health, as indicated by their T-cell immuneresponse, have greater FIDs and flee farther (Figure 15.5[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#FIGm-fig-102]). Because health state affects generalantipredatory behavior performance (Lindström et al. 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.41]), the ability of “poor” conditionpenguin chicks to defend themselves may be lower, forcing them to be shyer.Moreover, skuas and other avian predators might assess that bolder individualpenguin chicks that escape relatively later or face the predator will be moredifficult to capture, diverting their attacks to shyer individuals. Thereforebolder individuals might be signaling to predators their ability to escape anddefend from a potential attack (see Chapter 10[OEBPS_Text_part0024.xhtml#CN-bp-10]).[OEBPS_Images_image00997.jpeg]Figure 15.5Inter-individual variability in state-dependent escape responses in unguardedchicks of chinstrap penguin, Pygoscelis antarctica.

(d) Skuas, Catharacta antarctica preying on apenguin chick.(Figure redrawn from Martín et al. 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.47]; photographs by J. Martín)Similarly, the escape response of incubating female eiders, Somateriamollissima, is modulated by interactions between stress responsiveness andindividual quality (Seltmann et al. 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.59]). Younger females with higher stressresponses (those with higher handling-induced corticosterone bloodconcentrations) have greater FIDs, whereas the opposite is found in the oldestfemales, which are considered of higher quality because they have more breedingexperience. Furthermore, the effect of stress on FIDs is less marked in femalesin good body condition.The sources of individual variation in antipredator behavior of a homogeneousgroup of adult male rock lizards, Iberolacerta cyreni, were examined in anotherstudy (Figure 15.6 [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#FIGm-fig-103]). In a laboratorysetting, experimenters simulated repeated predatory attacks of low or high riskand analyzed activity levels, escape decisions and refuge use of lizards in bothrisk situations (López et al. 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.42]).Results showed consistent inter-individual differences in the magnitude of theantipredator responses under similar conditions of risk and costs. Theseindividual differences in propensity to take risk could be caused by theexistence of two consistent and independent shy–bold continua. The firstshy–bold continuum describes the time spent hidden in the refuge after predatoryattacks, with shy lizards hiding for longer. The second shy–bold continuumdescribes the propensity to make false-alarm flights and hide before an actualpredator attack occurs (López et al. 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.42]). These shy–bold gradients can berelated to the morphology and health state of each individual lizard: shyindividuals that spend more time hidden in refuges have greater absolute bodysizes, but relatively smaller head sizes (an index of a lower social dominance)and a worse body condition and immune system. However, shy individuals with ahigh propensity to hide when risk is low are those with smaller absolute bodysizes, whereas their relative body size and the health state are not important(López et al. 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.42]). Interestingly,more dominant individuals were bolder. Similarly, territorial dominant males ofthe skink, Eulamprus heatwolei, were less likely than floater males to enterrefuge when approached and returned to basking sites sooner after being attacked(Stapley & Keogh 2004 [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.67]). This mayreflect the existence of a behavioral syndrome between boldness when usingrefuges and aggression toward conspecifics (see section 15.2.3[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#B-sec-134] above).[OEBPS_Images_image00998.jpeg]Figure 15.6State-dependent hiding responses in adult male rock lizards, Iberolacertacyreni. Relation between a shy–bold continuum (which describes a gradient frombold lizards that spent shorter times hidden in the refuge after predatoryapproaches to shy lizards with longer hiding times) and (a) absolute body size,(b) relative body size, and (c) immune response of lizards. (d, e) “Shy” and“bold” respectively, individual adult male rock lizards, Iberolacerta cyreni.(Figure redrawn from López et al. 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.42];photographs by J. Martín)In yellow-bellied marmots, the cost of lost foraging opportunities interactswith personalities to determine hiding times inside refuges (Blumstein &Pelletier 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.7]; Figure 15.7[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#FIGm-fig-104]). Bolder individuals that had shorterFIDs before hiding had subsequently shorter hiding times when food had beenexperimentally placed outside of their burrows before the attack than when nofood was added. In contrast, shy individuals with longer FIDs, had subsequentlonger hiding times if there were food present. These results might be explainedby state-dependent responses whereby bold individuals were hungrier, and thusdelayed escaping and hid for shorter periods of time. Alternatively, if boldindividuals were less alarmed by the attack, they could be more able to estimatemore accurately the costs of escape. However, both shy and bold marmots hadsimilar hiding times in the no-food treatment.[OEBPS_Images_image00999.jpeg]Figure 15.7(a) A vigilant yellow-bellied marmot (Marmot flaviventris) monitoring anapproaching predator.(b) The effect of FID (shy individuals have longer FIDs) onhiding time (mean ± SD) in their burrows by yellow-bellied marmots, Marmotaflaviventris, as a function of whether supplementary food was presented or not.(Photograph by B. Hulsey; figure redrawn from Blumstein & Pelletier 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.7])Results of these experiments suggest that the relative boldness of an individualwhen deciding escape or refuge use might be a function of state-dependentfactors, such as its health and associated ability to evade predators. Moreover,all these characteristics can be considered as relatively fixed andphenotypically stable characteristics of an individual that might also beheritable. Persistence of personalities may emerge from positive feedback. Forexample, bolder individuals who are able to access food sooner, evade predatorsmore easily, etc., and therefore maintain their higher states. In contrast,individuals in poor condition hide longer, lose opportunities to forage, andthus stay in a lower state.15.3.2 LIFE HISTORY TRADE-OFFS WHEN DECIDING ESCAPE RESPONSESA meta-analysis (Smith & Blumstein 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.65]) suggests that the evolutionarymechanisms maintaining inter-individual variation in boldness may illustrate atrade-off between current and future reproduction (life history trade-offshypothesis) with individual fitness varying depending on the context of thesituation (Sih et al. 2004b [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.63]; Wolf etal. 2007 [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.74]; Biro & Stamps 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.6]). Thus bolder individuals may havegreater growth and reproductive success than shyer ones, but will suffer greaterpredation risk and have shorter life spans (productivity (growth)–mortalitytrade-off: Biro & Stamps 2008 [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.6]). Incontrast, shy individuals may have reduced short-term reproductive success butwill live longer by reducing predation risk, and therefore have the same overalllife-time fitness as bold individuals (see models in Stamps 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.66]; Wolf et al. 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.74]). This trade-off may affect animalescape decisions.Empirical evidence for the “life history trade-off hypothesis” (Wolf et al. 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.74]; Biro & Stamps 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.6]) with respect to escape responses issuggested from a field study of rock agamas (Carter et al. 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.13]). Bolder male agamas (those withconsistently shorter FIDs) spend more time exposed in basking or moving and lesstime hidden than shyer males, suggesting the existence of a behavioral syndrome.These differences may have fitness consequences; bolder males benefit by havinglarger home ranges, which increase access to females and food, and higherfeeding rates than shyer males. However, given that bolder males spent more timebeing conspicuous, they should suffer a higher predation risk, as inferred froma higher rate of tail loss (Carter et al. 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.13]). These observations suggest thatbolder males may have higher reproductive success, but being bold may increasepredation risk at a younger age, making their lifetime reproductive successequal to that of shyer males.15.3.3 NEGATIVE FREQUENCY-DEPENDENT SELECTION ON ESCAPE RESPONSESAlthough differences in state or life-history strategies may provide anexplanation for personality differences (Dall et al. 2004[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.23]; Biro & Stamps 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.6]; Sih & Bell 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.60]), there are many cases whereindividuals do not seem to differ in state, and it is not clear why astate-dependent response should be correlated with other behaviors in othercontexts. Some alternative or complementary explanations to the evolution ofpersonalities have been suggested, including negative frequency-dependentselection, spatio-temporal variations in the environment, or non-equilibriumdynamics, which could promote the coexistence of phenotypic variation in thepopulation in stable frequencies (see review in Wolf et al. 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.76]). Nevertheless, these explanationsaccount only for the existence of different personalities within a populationbut they do not explain why personality is consistent within an individual.One study examined the role of negative frequency-dependent selection ininter-individual variations in antipredatory behavior of flocks of red knots,Calidris canutus, in response to a model sparrowhawk, Accipiter nisus (Mathot etal. 2011 [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.46]). Although flocks of knotsdiffered in their escape behavior in relation to risk level, there was nobetween-individual variation in escape flight duration within flocks. Incontrast, individuals differed in their degree of plasticity for the proportionof time spent vigilant across risk levels. These results support the predictionthat traits with negative frequency-dependent payoffs (vigilance) may favorindividual variation in plasticity (Wolf et al. 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.75], 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.76]), while traits with positive frequencystate-dependent payoffs (escape flights) may favor cohesiveness among groupmembers.15.4 FUTURE DIRECTIONSAlthough we have a relatively good understanding of the various trade-offsbetween avoiding predators and costs of the escape response and refuge use thatan individual prey can face, we need to fully explain the causes of theinter-individual variation in escape strategies. However, most studies are basedon single observations of each individual, while we need to track the sameindividuals in multiple occasions to test for consistency and repeatability ofpersonalities in the different components of escape behavior and refuge use, andfor the existence of plasticity and correlations between the differentbehaviors.Also, to develop a comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary andecological significance of personalities in escape responses, we need moreintegrative studies that follow a Tinbergian multidisciplinary approach (Sih etal. 2004b [OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.63]; Bell 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.2]). Thus we need to determine: (1) theproximate mechanisms (hormonal and neurological pathways, health state, etc.)underlying variation in escape responses; (2) the genetic basis ofpersonalities, which may depend on both inherited and environmentally responsivegenes, and may also suffer maternal effects (Bell 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.3]); (3) the factors that influence whetherthe escape responses and other behaviors (e.g., exploration, aggression) aredecoupled or correlated as behavioral syndromes (Sih & Bell 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0029.xhtml#REFe-r-15.60]); and (4) the fitness consequences ofdifferent escape strategies to test whether individuals with differentpersonalities have similar success in evading predators, or whether, even ifrisk of predation is higher for some personality types, this is compensated forhigher benefits in other contexts (foraging, reproduction, etc.) leading tosimilar lifetime fitness.Finally, future theoretical models of optimal escape behavior and refuge usewill have to incorporate relevant individuality into their structure/logic.Delaying escape or spending longer times hidden in a refuge than otherindividuals should not be considered as always maladaptive, but may simplyrepresent alternative adaptive personalities, which may be understood whenknowing the whole suite of behavioral responses and ecological demands of ananimal.REFERENCESBell, A.

Blumstein, Diogo S. M. Samia, Theodore Stankowich, and William E.CooperJr.Escape decisions have been studied in a remarkably Tinbergian way that hasincluded examination of both proximate and ultimate questions, includingquestions about the evolution of escape behavior. Evolutionary studies have beenmade possible by developing large comparative data sets. Methodologicaldifferences, however, may impede our ability to combine studies to createcomparative databases that can be, and have been, used to ask both evolutionaryquestions and questions of management relevance. Evolutionary comparativestudies and meta-analyses both depend on animals being studied in relativelyconsistent ways, yet astute readers of the primary literature will have noticedthat there is great variation in the ways in which studies of escape have beenconducted. We wish to discuss some of the variation in how escape has beenstudied, and to recommend best practices for moving forward. We discuss severalkey details below, focusing primarily on flight initiation distance (FID).In part because escape theory is now capable of predicting many aspects ofescape behavior and in part because hypothesis-driven research is an efficientway to advance our understanding, the use of focused hypotheses and predictionsis a fundamental feature of best practices for escape studies. Beyond this keyfeature, we make many recommendations that apply to a wide range of studies. Ourrecommendations, however, do not apply universally. In some cases, researchersshould ignore our suggestions if, for instance, they wish to study theconsequences of a recommendation. In other cases it may be essential to alterthe approach protocol to ask other focused questions. Thus researchers shouldview our recommended practices as guidelines, not scripture.16.1 BEHAVIOR OF PREY AS A TRIAL BEGINSBefore measuring the escape of an individual, many key data must be collected.What animals are doing before they are experimentally approached influences bothflight decisions (e.g., level of alertness, fighting with conspecifics, foragingin a profitable patch, sleeping or lying down: reviewed in Stankowich &Blumstein 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.42]) and hiding timedecisions (Blumstein & Pelletier 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.5]).We suggest that animals be relaxed yet not sleeping, as opposed to highlyvigilant, when initiating an experimental approach. Relaxed behavior mightinclude sitting and looking, or being perched, singing or producing othernon-alarm vocalizations or signals, self-grooming, or foraging. Some protocols(including some of ours) require humans to identify a subject from a givendistance and then wait quietly for five to ten seconds before initiating anexperimental approach. In theory this is fine, but some species (e.g., browsingungulates) move quickly through an area and the opportunity to approach might belost if there is a lengthy delay before approach. In practice, animals maycontinue monitoring us, albeit in a relaxed way, and animals that were alert tothe approacher prior to the initiation of the approach may make flight decisionsdifferently than unaware subjects with different information about theapproacher (Stankowich & Coss 2006 [OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.43]).This requires a decision about whether or not to include immediate flushes whenthe experimental approach begins. Ultimately, this decision may rest on theexact question being asked. For example, immediate flushes may be of particularinterest when testing the flush early and avoid the rush (FEAR) hypothesis(Blumstein 2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.3]; Chapter 2[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#CN-bp-2]).These recommendations apply to many birds and mammals, but cannot be followedreadily in some other taxa, including lizards, especially those that are ambushforagers in which it is often not possible to discern signs of vigilance (Cooper2008a [OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.14], b[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.15]). For such prey, an experimenterapproaches to some starting distance (SD) and position at which the prey ispresumed to have detected the experimenter, stops for a brief interval, and thenbegins an experimental approach. Thus, SD equals alert distance (AD), and onlyquestions related to zones I and II (Blumstein 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.1]) can be studied because the subject isalready aware of the threat. It would be preferable to include approachesbeginning at longer SDs when the examination of effects of spontaneous movementsand the flushing early hypothesis are of interest. Inclusion of longer SDs wouldmake lizard studies more comparable to those on birds and mammals, but the issueof degree of vigilance remains problematic. This might be addressed bymonitoring focal animals for physiological correlates of vigilance (sensuBlumstein & Bouskila 1996 [OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.4]). Anotheradvantage of including long SDs is that in FID should begin to asymptote at theboundary of zone II, where prey monitor predators, and zone III, where they donot.16.2 NUMBER OF HUMANSThe vast majority of FID experiments have used a single experimenter to flushindividuals. Unless the objective is to study the effects of multiple observers(Geist et al. 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.30]; Cooper et al. 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.20]), we suggest that future studies use asingle observer. By doing so, we ensure that future data will be maximallycomparable to previously collected data. Sometimes a second person is called into watch the animals from afar and record behavior. This practice should be fineas long as there is only a single person experimentally approaching the subject.Ideally, the second person is at a distance far enough to not influence theescape behavior of the animal (since the number of predators can affect thesubject’s flight decision), but close enough to guarantee the accuracy of theirrecords.16.3 GROUP SIZEThe prey’s group size can influence antipredator behavior and escape responses.Models of predation risk assessment predict that FID decreases as group sizeincreases for two possible reasons: (1) either risk to the individuals decreasesas group size increases because the predator has more choices (risk dilutionhypothesis; Roberts 1996 [OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.38]) or (2) anindividual’s risk decreases because at least one group member will detect thepredator before it can overtake any member of the group (many-eyes hypothesis;Roberts 1996 [OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.38]), permitting escape. Thesehypotheses are not mutually exclusive. Indeed, a variety of studies demonstratethat group size influences FID (Fernández-Juricic et al. 2004[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.27]; Stankowich & Coss 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.43]), but the strength of the effect iswidely variable, even within taxa (Stankowich & Blumstein 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.42]; Stankowich 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.41]). As species get larger, the areaaround them that they monitor increases (Blumstein et al. 2004[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.6]). Thus it is essential to collectinformation on the number of conspecifics and, if interested, heterospecifics,within a biologically relevant distance and use these values as covariates insubsequent analyses.16.4 STARTING DISTANCE AND ALERT DISTANCEStarting distance has one of the largest effects on FID for many species (Samiaet al. 2013 [OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.40]), and serves as a proxy forthe real biologically relevant measure, alert distance (Blumstein 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.1]). The main difference between thesevariables is that SD is determined by the experimenter, whereas AD is determinedby the focal animal. Despite this key difference, it is impossible to test theeffect of AD without varying the SD because of a mathematical constraint thatlinks these two variables (i.e., SD ≥ AD; see detailed discussion in section16.9 [OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#A-sec-98] below). In some studies of lizards,SDs have been systematically varied to include observations over a wide range ofvalues (Cooper 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.12], 2008; Cooper etal. 2009 [OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.21]). And while some large datasets exist on birds and mammals that have a variety of SDs, many of these havebeen collected in an ad hoc manner; systematic variation in their collection isneeded. Indeed, it is desirable to include approaches beginning at longer SDwhen studying the effects of spontaneous movements or when testing the FEARhypothesis. Inclusion of longer SDs would make lizard studies more comparable tothose on birds and mammals, but the issue of degree of vigilance (AD) remainsproblematic as does the ability to observe a relatively tiny lizard in shrubbyhabitat. This might be addressed by monitoring focal animals for physiologicalcorrelates of vigilance.We recognize that several issues arise when initiating experimental approachesat variable distances. There may be distances beyond which animals will not fleefrom an approaching person, possibly because it is simply not worth it orbecause the human is not detected (zone III: Blumstein 2003[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.1]; Chapter 3[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#CN-bp-3]). Thus initiating experimental flushes atrelatively long distances may mean that the experimenter walks toward an animaluntil s/he is detected or enters a “zone of awareness” where the animal beginsassessing risk (zone II). Given that animals are constrained in their ability toscan in all directions at all times, an approacher starting from outside thezone of awareness (Dmax) and walking directly toward the animal may be able toapproach nearer the subject before it becomes alert than an approacher millingaround at Dmax, where the subject might eventually become alert before approachbegins. This effect could lead to shorter ADs in zone II and a general quadraticeffect between SD and FID (Stankowich & Coss 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.43]; Chapter 3[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#CN-bp-3]: Figure 3.1[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#FIGm-fig-17]). In addition to this effect, a predatorapproaching in a prey’s field of view may well be detected while farther fromthe prey than one that is out of the field of view. Similarly, prey may detectpredators farther away if they approach from within a binocular vs. monocularfield of view, in taxa that have both, such as birds. In lizards, detection iseasier when the predator is in one of the lateral fields of view than when infront of or behind the lizards (Cooper 2008a[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.14], b[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.15]).Because animals may look up and move at the start of natural bouts of vigilanceand intermittent locomotion (here named as “spontaneous behaviors”), mistakenlyscoring spontaneous behaviors as AD or FID is theoretically more likely forexperiments with large SD (Cooper 2008a[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.14], b[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.15]; Cooper & Blumstein 2014[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.18]). As long as the experimenter isattuned to eventual natural threats or distractions (such as social behavior),long approaches will likely not produce spurious data. Despite their potentialto confound the study of escape, we do not believe these are often “real” issuesbecause it is usually very obvious when an animal alerts or flees from anapproaching human. We recommend that if an observer is unsure of whether theanimal is responding to their experimental approach, they should simply notrecord data for that approach. Although some models have shown that spontaneousbehaviors could potentially bias the conclusions that are drawn(Chamaillé-Jammes & Blumstein 2012 [OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.9]), ourexperience with over 15,000 experimental approaches on lizards, birds, andmammals, suggests that it is very unlikely that we have been making systematicmistakes scoring escape decisions. Moreover, the influence of spontaneousbehaviors on final results may be in itself of particular interest. Withknowledge of natural patterns of vigilance and locomotion, it is possible todevelop null models (Williams et al. 2014[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.44]) that allow one to eliminate thoseexperimental approaches that are possibly “tainted.” Even without suchknowledge, it is possible to develop null models that eliminate the suspicion ofspurious relationship caused by tainted observations (Samia et al. 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.40]).Some investigators have used a fixed or narrow range of SDs to study effects offactors that affect the cost of not fleeing and the cost of fleeing. Thesedistances are intended to be long enough to avoid creating situations in whichescape is immediate (Cooper 1998 [OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.11], 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.16]), yet short enough to ensure that theprey has detected the predator before the approach begins (e.g., Møller &Garamszegi 2012 [OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.34] and almost all lizardstudies). If SD is fixed or has a narrow range, there must be some justificationfor selecting a particular distance and the experimenters must clearly describetheir rationale for selecting this distance. When working with an unfamiliarspecies or situation, we recommend that pilot data be collected to ensure thatthe SD is appropriate. It is important to ensure the prey is monitoring thepredator during the entire approach, which is necessary for the predator–preyencounter to match the scenario of the economic escape models of Ydenberg andDill (1986 [OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.45]) and Cooper and Frederick(2007 [OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.19]).16.5 FLIGHT INITIATION DISTANCEMany of our recommendations are designed to properly measure FID. When animalsare on the ground, FID is readily measured as the straight line separating theexperimenter and the animal when the escape begins. To identify the exact pointat which FID (and other variables) occurs, many experimenters drop weightedflags or other objects along the path of approach. Typically markers are placed(1) at the starting point of the experimental approach; (2) at the approacher’sposition when the prey becomes alert and responds to the approacher; (3) at thepoint where the prey began to flee; and (4) at the point where prey was locatedat the start of the experiment. The distance between markers 1 and 4 is SD; thatbetween markers 2 and 4 is AD, and that between markers 3 and 4 is FID.Additionally, beyond the preferred method of measuring FID using ameasuring-tape or laser rangefinder, it is also a common practice forexperimenters to convert the number of paces into meters to record the escapevariables (e.g., SD, AD, FID; Blumstein 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.2]).However, when studying many birds, lizards, or arboreal mammals, the focalanimal may be perched above the ground. Two procedures have been developed tomeasure the FID for animals off the ground.The first is to test all individuals, and then determine the boundary height,which is assumed to represent the maximum height at which the animals perceivethemselves to be at risk (c. two to three meters for some lizards approached byhuman investigators; Cooper 1997 [OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.10];Cooper & Avalos 2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.17]). Flightinitiation distance is calculated as if all individuals are at ground level(i.e., no adjustment is made for differences in predator–prey distance amongperch heights). The relationship between perch height and FID is studied in therange 0 m to boundary height. At typical SDs and FIDs, this has a relativelysmall effect on estimates of distance. However, as perch height increases, theproportion of the Euclidean distance between predator and prey that isattributable to perch height increases substantially. To our knowledge, onlylizards have been tested using this boundary height approach to date.A second, more generally correct, method has been used to study many birds andarboreal mammals that flee when perched at greater heights, where perch heightmay account for a large portion of the Euclidean distance. Birds are usuallytested using the “direct” FID, which is calculated as the Euclidian distancebetween experimenter and focal animal (i.e., the square root of the sum of thesquared horizontal distance and the squared height of perch; Blumstein 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.2]). Because height in tree may (or maynot) affect risk perception (Blumstein et al. 2004[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.6]), our conservative suggestion is thatheight should be estimated and the direct FID (FIDdirect) should be calculatedusing the Pythagorean theorem. It should be noted, however, that becauseFIDdirect depends on the height an individual is in a tree, it is possible thatwhen there are immediate or near immediate flushes, FIDdirect may be greaterthan SD. This would contradict the envelope constraint (where SD > AD > FID).16.6 APPROACH SPEED AND ANGLEWe know that the speed at which an individual is approached may influence boththe decision to flee and the decision to hide. Thus it is important forresearchers to report clearly the approach speed. Many data have been collectedby approaching animals between 0.5 and 1.0 m/s (Blumstein 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.2]; Gulbransen et al. 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.31]). As humans speed up (e.g., 0.5 to 1.0m/s vs. 2 to 3 m/s in Stankowich & Coss 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.43]; Chapter 5[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#CN-bp-5]), speed has detectable effects on escape.While it is essential to vary approach speed to determine whether animals aremaintaining a spatial margin of safety or a temporal margin of safety (Cárdenaset al. 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.8]), and to study joint effectsof approach speed and other factors that may affect FID, we recommend a defaultapproach speed of 0.5 to 1.0 m/s to ensure data are maximally comparable withother studies. In comparative studies, if animals are approached at differentspeeds, approach speed could be used as a covariate (e.g., Cooper et al. 2014[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.23]). And speed can be varied duringapproach to study effects of changes during approach on FID (Cooper 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.13]), but investigators should realize thatthese will not be generally comparable with other studies.The angle and directness of approach also may affect escape decisions(Fernández-Juricic et al. 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.28]; Cooperet al. 2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.22]; Chapter 5[OEBPS_Text_part0016.xhtml#CN-bp-5]). Interestingly, while many species are moretolerant of tangential approaches compared to direct approaches, birds studiedin a high-elevation grassland in Argentina were more sensitive to tangentialapproaches (Fernández-Juricic et al. 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.28]). Unless it is of interest to study theeffect of directness of approach or the approacher is restricted to establishedtrails in sensitive wildlife areas, we recommend that researchers directlyapproach experimental subjects. In some cases it may be prudent to add thebypass distance (for tangential approaches) as a covariate in models explainingvariation in FID.16.7 WHEN TO STOP APPROACHINGOnce an animal flees, a relevant question is whether to stop approaching towardthe location where animal was, continuing to walk up to its initial location, orcontinue approaching the prey past its initial location. Pragmatically, toproperly measure SD, it is important to know precisely the location of thesubject. Additionally, if it is desirable to measure the distance fled, or thedistance to the nearest refuge, it is essential to go to the subject’s initiallocation. Our recommendation is that approaches should be terminated in one oftwo places, the predator’s location when escape begins or the prey’s locationwhen escape begins. If the predator continues to the initial position where thesubject was at the start of the experimental approach, the prey will likely fleea longer distance and/or be more likely to enter refuge than if the predatorstops moving as soon as the prey flees. The choice between these stopping pointssometimes may be dictated by the escape tendencies of the prey, the need tocontinue observations on the animal (i.e., escape into refuge or out of the areais undesirable), or the need to maintain comparability with previously collecteddata.If the approacher continues to the prey’s initial location, distance fled willdepend on the additional risk implied by the continued approach and will verylikely vary with the directness of approach during flight (i.e., on the anglebetween the approach path and the flight path). With continued approach,distance fled, probability of refuge entry, and hiding time may increase. Thecorrelation between distance to refuge and distance fled may also be greaterthan when the predator stops approaching when escape begins. We also note thatsometimes it may be essential to follow an animal until it hides, if the goal isto study hiding time. Stopping as soon as the prey flees may be realistic inportraying reactions of predators that stop approaching when they assess thatthey will not be able to capture the prey. Experimentally pursuing prey might bethe most realistic way to simulate attacks by pursuing predators, but pursuitintroduces uncontrolled variation in risk and costs that may affect distancefled and hiding time. Continuing to approach, but only to the prey’s initiallocation, may be a compromise between these extremes and has the advantage ofbeing more likely to induce prey to enter refuge if hiding time is of interest.16.8 DATA TO COLLECTAt the very minimum, data sheets should permit the collection of location, date,time, species, sex, initial behavior, starting distance, alert distance, flightinitiation distance, and the number of conspecifics (and potentiallyheterospecifics) within a biologically relevant distance. Of course, additionalquestions can be asked with additional data and some researchers (and for somequestions) have collected data on how far animals were from refugia when anexperimental approach began, details about the type of movement during escape,and the distance fled. Some researchers have examined subsequent escapedecisions that have included the dynamics of the second flush (which sometimeshappens), and the dynamics of hiding, the type of escape behavior performed, thedistance fled, or the latency to resume initial behavior. Analyses that includesuch additional information can provide a richer understanding of escape, but werecommend that investigators also collect the initial data to ensure maximumcomparability.16.9 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF FID DATA16.9.1 USE OF SD OR AD AS COVARIATE OR STUDY OF INTERACTIONS INVOLVING THE SD XFID RELATIONSHIPThere are many statistical issues associated with analyzing FID data. A keyfeature of the analysis of FID data is that variance in both AD and FIDincreases as a function of SD. This happens because these variables are subjectto a constraint envelope relationship where SD ≥ AD ≥ FID. Logically, a preycannot flee from a predator (FID) at a greater distance than where it wasdetected (AD) and, similarly, prey cannot become alert to a predator before thepredator initiates its approach (SD). We note that there are situations where AD> SD are possible, but, because true AD is not measurable when animals arealerted to the experimenter prior to the start of the approach, suchobservations do not typically exist in FID data sets or AD is set to equal SD.For example, SD = AD in experiments in which all approaches begin at relativelyshort SDs at which prey are already aware of the predator’s presence. Theconstraint envelope is an unavoidable statistical issue in FID studies and hasimplications as to how data may be analyzed.Our first statistical recommendation is: if starting distances vary and alertdistances are not available, starting distance must be added as covariate insubsequent statistical models. However, starting distance is unrelated to FID insome species, especially at slow approach speeds. For studies of single speciesfor which it is known that SD and FID are unrelated, SD should not be used as acovariate. Starting distance is a proxy for AD and it likely explains aconsiderable proportion of the variance in FID (Blumstein 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.3]; Samia et al. 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.40]; Samia & Blumstein 2014[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.39]). This creates a statistical issueabout whether the effect of other variables should be tested as main effects oras interactions between SD and the other variables. When interpreting a two-wayinteraction, the question becomes “does a variable of interest influence theexpected relationship between SD and FID?” Researchers have tested these bothways and we recommend thorough examination leading to an understanding of thenature of a data set before making a decision about whether to focus oninterpreting main effects or interactions.16.9.2 SHOULD THE FID X SD REGRESSION BE FORCED THROUGH THE ORIGIN?Another important decision one must make is whether or not to include anintercept in statistical models of data sets that include SD. Because FID cannotbe greater than the distance where an experimental approach begins, FID is zerowhen SD is zero. Some investigators prefer to force though the origin and otherdo not when using regression models. It is important to note that the slopes andestimated intercepts of fitted regression models likely differ in zones I, II,and III (Blumstein 2003 [OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.1]; Stankowich &Coss 2006 [OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.43]; Chapter 3[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#CN-bp-3]), and that it may be more appropriate toconduct separate regressions in the different zones. If you know your data areexclusively in zone I, you should force the fitted model through the origin(i.e., exclude the intercept – unless you want to test the hypothesis that theintercept differs from 0). If you suspect that your data spans zones I and II,you should consider fitting a piecewise linear regression where you can look fora breakpoint. If you suspect your data spans only zones II and III, you shouldconsider exploring both linear and non-linear models (e.g., logarithmic) withintercepts included, as the predicted relationship between SD and FID changeswith increasing SD. The remaining residual error can then be used to test forwhatever factor effects were included in the study. Please note that while theidea of three zones is conceptually useful, focused empirical studies are neededto properly define these zones in a given species.16.9.3 SPONTANEOUS MOVEMENTS AND THE DECISION TO KEEP OBSERVATIONS OF IMMEDIATEFLIGHTAnother issue is whether or not to remove values where SD = FID. In zone Iimmediate flushing is predicted, but in zone II prey are predicted to monitorthe predator’s approach prior to fleeing. Situations where SD = FID may be theresult of animals flushing immediately at the start of the experimental approachif the SD happens to be the FID for that individual, which occurs at theboundary of zones I and II or may occur if an animal is particularly wary. Atlonger SDs, flushing may also be attributable to spontaneous movements (Williamset al. 2014 [OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.44]). We generally suggest thatinvestigators only remove data if they believe that the movement is not inresponse to a predator and to otherwise keep cases where SD = FID.In cases where SD varies considerably, FID studies can profitably employquantile regression, particularly if one is concerned that long SD values mayinfluence the relationship between SD or AD and FID (Chamaillé-Jammes &Blumstein 2012 [OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.9]). Quantile regressionestimates how subsets of the data vary. Thus if one is concerned that at largeSDs, larger FIDs may reflect spontaneous movement (see below), one could focuson quantiles that did not include these data. Quantile regression cannot be usedif SD is fixed. And quantile regression requires a substantial amount of data toprofitably employ it.16.9.4 OTHER STATISTICAL ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH STUDYING FIDBecause correlational statistics are sensitive both to expectedheteroscedasticity (caused by the constraint envelope) and to outliers with highleverage, such effects can lead to potentially erroneous conclusions aboutwhether observations support the FEAR hypothesis or not. Samia and Blumstein(2014 [OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.39]) developed an index (phi, Ф)designed to test the 1:1 expectation in an SD–FID or an AD–FID relationship in away that avoids the above statistical pitfalls. Moreover, in addition toallowing the proper evaluation of the FEAR hypothesis, the index permits one todetermine if a species is flushing later or with no predetermined strategy.Recently, there have been some concerns about the use of SD as proxy for AD(Dumont et al. 2012 [OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.25]). If SD is not agood proxy for AD, conclusions drawn from studies using SD rather than AD mightbe suspect. It could be even more critical to studies of lizards for which AD isdifficult to determine. However, a further comparative study with 75 avianspecies showed that the use of SD is a conservative alternative to using AD as acovariate in FID studies (Samia & Blumstein 2014[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.39]). By conservative, we mean that while alow and/or non-significant SD–FID relationship is inconclusive, a large and/orsignificant SD–FID is robust support of the influence that AD has on FID.Computational simulations and null models have been recently used to study FID.Specifically, computational simulations have been used to model the effect ofspontaneous behaviors on FID (Chamaillé-Jammes & Blumstein 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.9]), to filter the data according with abaseline rate of spontaneous behaviors observed in natural conditions (Williamset al. 2014 [OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.44]), to eliminate thesuspicion of spurious data in the AD–FID relationship caused by the envelopeconstraint (Dumont et al. 2012 [OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.25]; Samiaet al. 2013 [OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.40]), and to simulate nulldistributions of metrics developed to test the FEAR hypothesis (Samia &Blumstein 2014 [OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.39]). The already availablealgorithms can be valuable when one tests the FEAR hypothesis, but we argue thatfurther benefits can be obtained by using computational simulations. Forexample, the conceptual zones that Blumstein (2003[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.1]) proposed influence escape behavior.Because it is difficult to identify such zones in natural conditions,mathematical and computational models can help us better understand their rolesin dynamic decision-making of prey. We expect that future advances in ourunderstanding of escape will rely on developing specific null models and usingcomputational simulations to evaluate empirical data.16.10 COMPARATIVE STUDIES AND META-ANALYSES: A COMPLEMENTARY WAY TO STUDY ESCAPEMany hypotheses about escape theory have been studied using a comparative ormeta-analytical approach (Stankowich & Blumstein 2005[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.42]; Blumstein 2006[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.2]; Møller 2008[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.33]; Samia et al. 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.40]). Because the evolutionary history oftaxa renders species not statistically independent, most of these studies usephylogenetically informed models to account for the non-independence (Garland &Ives 2000 [OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.29]; Felsenstein 2004[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.26]; Lajeunesse 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.32]; Nakagawa & Santos 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.36]). Some recent studies, however, showremarkable plasticity in escape behavior that seems rather unconstrained byphylogeny (e.g., Cooper et al. 2014 [OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.23])and different populations of the same species often vary greatly in their flightresponses based on their experience with natural predators or humans. Thus werecommend that in comparative studies, authors provide a measure of thephylogenetic signal of the FID. To date, we have little evidence to assesswhether FID is a conserved or a species-specific trait. This is because,although most interspecific studies control the phylogenetic effect, few studiesprovide a measure of phylogenetic signal such as Pagel’s lambda or Bloomberg’s K(for exceptions, see Møller & Garamszegi 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.34]; Samia et al. 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.40]). In the absence of such measures, thesuperiority of phylogenetic models, as indicated by adjusted r2 or Akaike’sinformation criterion, indicates that a phylogenetic signal occurs, but does notquantify its strength (Cooper et al. 2014[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.23]). It is also important to realize thatphylogenetic models are not indicated when there is no phylogenetic signalpresent because there is increased uncertainty about parameter estimates (Revell2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.37]).Our final suggestion is one that has brought us all together. We think thatwhile there is a lot to learn from single-species studies of escape, weencourage others to present their findings either in the context ofmeta-analysis or to present them in ways that facilitate future meta-analyses(“meta-analytic thinking”; Cumming & Finch 2001[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.24]; Nakagawa & Cuthill 2007[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.35]; Borenstein et al. 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#REFe-r-16.7]). This requires a bit of a paradigmshift and we have two recommendations to facilitate this shift. In primarystudies, we suggest that inferences should be based on the magnitude of theeffect; thus researchers should present the effect size along with itsconfidence interval. Second, we encourage researchers to present results insufficient detail so that the calculation of the effect size can be made easily(e.g., provide the sample size and the exact P-values of statistics).16.11 CONCLUSIONSWe are thrilled and excited by both the number of studies and the diversity ofstudies of escape behavior. We hope that our suggestions for standardizing someof the ways that escape is studied will lead to even more comparative studiesand meta-analyses. Indeed, we believe that it is through these sorts of studiesthat generalizations emerge. Creating such data sets is typically beyond thescope of a single researcher or a single study. As we also wrote, there arereasons to ignore some of our suggestions and researchers that do so willinvariably discover new ways that animals manage predation risk through thedynamics of their escape behavior. We look forward to reading those studies inthe future!REFERENCESBlumstein, D. T. (2003). Flight initiation distance in birds is dependent onintruder starting distance.

Cooper, Jr.17.1 INTRODUCTIONAs the chapters in this volume have shown, the field of escape behavior is bothactive and diverse. What has particularly excited us while editing this book ishow a simple economic framework, pioneered by Ydenberg and Dill (1986[OEBPS_Text_part0032.xhtml#REFe-r-17.19]) that (as they wrote in the forward)had problems getting published, has stimulated so much work about so manydifferent aspects of escape. Theoretical advances have been coupled withempirical study. Indeed, we suggest that the study of escape provides a textbookexample of the reciprocally illuminating interplay between theoretical models,observational and experimental empirical studies, and comparative studies,including meta-analyses. Many, but not all, escape decisions can be studiedwithout specialized equipment. This simplicity and elegance puts the emphasis onclear thinking and focused hypothesis testing. We have taught classes and shortcourses on quantifying escape behavior. Students learn the methods quickly andare able to produce high-quality data soon. Thus we believe that the study ofescape will continue to be a highly productive field. This is good because whilewe have learned a lot, as our authors have noted, there’s much room for futurediscovery! In this afterword, we will briefly highlight five themes or questionsthat have emerged from this book, and touch on a sixth theme that we did nothave sufficient room to properly discuss.17.2 THE IMPORTANCE OF STUDYING INDIVIDUALSThe field of behavioral ecology has fully embraced the importance ofunderstanding individual variation (Carere & Maestripieri 2013[OEBPS_Text_part0032.xhtml#REFe-r-17.6]). Indeed, the publication of papersshowing that individuals behave in consistently different ways – they havepersonalities – has exploded over the past decade. However, many of the studiesof escape behavior, especially those of FID and hiding time conducted in thefield, do not follow individually identified animals. There are some notableexceptions (Carrete & Tella 2010 [OEBPS_Text_part0032.xhtml#REFe-r-17.7]; Ibáñezet al. 2014 [OEBPS_Text_part0032.xhtml#REFe-r-17.11]; Williams et al. 2014[OEBPS_Text_part0032.xhtml#REFe-r-17.18]).The study of unmarked individuals has permitted remarkably large comparativedata sets to be produced. This is a particularly notable characteristic of theescape literature. However, by not following individually identified animals, weare prevented from asking some sorts of questions. Individually marked animalsare required to properly study the processes of habituation or sensitization torepeated exposure to predators (Runyan & Blumstein 2004[OEBPS_Text_part0032.xhtml#REFe-r-17.15]). Individually marked animals arerequired to study the maintenance of personality variation (FID is a metric ofboldness – Petelle et al. 2013 [OEBPS_Text_part0032.xhtml#REFe-r-17.13]).Without individually marked animals we cannot understand the importance ofindividual variation for escape decisions. Without studies of marked individualswe cannot study the quantitative genetics of escape behavior and understandselection and evolutionary dynamics.We encourage others to continue to study unmarked animals when such data permitanswers to salient questions, and when such studies also help expand largecomparative data sets. However, we strongly encourage future researchers tostudy escape decisions of marked animals. By doing so, we will be able toaddress unanswered, but addressable, questions, that will reveal a level ofcomplexity and nuance heretofore just hinted at.17.3 THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN INTERSPECIFIC STUDIES AND INTRASPECIFIC STUDIESThis brings us to a second emergent question – the interplay between comparativeresults and results from single species. Meta-analyses and comparative analyseshave shown that body size is an important determinant of escape decisions(Stankowich & Blumstein 2005 [OEBPS_Text_part0032.xhtml#REFe-r-17.16]; Blumstein2006 [OEBPS_Text_part0032.xhtml#REFe-r-17.2]; Chapter 3[OEBPS_Text_part0014.xhtml#CN-bp-3]). However, the range of body size acrossspecies is much greater than the range of body size within a species.Intraspecific studies often yield much smaller effect sizes than meta-analysesor do not find significant effects of body size on escape decisions (Petelle etal. 2013 [OEBPS_Text_part0032.xhtml#REFe-r-17.13]).It is therefore relevant to ask: what can we learn from interspecific studieswith respect to understanding decisions that individuals of a single speciesmake? We encourage future researchers to test specific hypotheses abouttrade-offs and constraints identified from comparative studies using data fromfocused, single-species studies to conduct comparisons of multiple species. Bydoing so, we will better understand the limits of interspecific conclusions forunderstanding individual decisions. Furthermore, comparative studies permitdetection of phylogenetic trends and important effects of ecology, life history,morphology, and physiology that may not be detectable using studies limited tosingle species.17.4 USING PHYSIOLOGY TO DEFINE DECISION-MAKING MECHANISMSThe third theme emerged from a careful reading of Chapter 13[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#CN-bp-13]. In that chapter Litvin et al. highlightedthe huge disconnect between field studies of escape and the detailed, andnuanced, insights that emerge from studies of escape behavior in laboratoryrodents. The studies they discussed have begun to identify specificneurophysiological pathways underlying specific escape behaviors. In some casesthey have shown us that what a field-oriented biologist may assume is one typeof escape behavior is actually controlled in a very proximate sense by differentmechanisms and thus is a more complex behavior than initially realized. Clearly,detailed neurophysiological studies will shed light on different decision-makingmechanisms and, by doing so, will enable us to better understand the drivers ofescape decisions. Much work remains to be done in this exciting field and futurefield investigators who draw insights from laboratory studies have the potentialto make fundamental advances in understanding decision-making in naturalsituations.Much of this book is focused on FID, but effects of physiology on FID have onlyrarely been studied in the field. One study cited in Chapter 13[OEBPS_Text_part0027.xhtml#CN-bp-13] detected a relationship betweencorticosterone level and FID in a lizard (Thaker et al. 2009[OEBPS_Text_part0032.xhtml#REFe-r-17.17]). We know of only two other studies ofthe physiology of FID, both of which confirm the importance of corticosterone inlizards (Berger et al. 2007 [OEBPS_Text_part0032.xhtml#REFe-r-17.1]; Rödl et al.2007 [OEBPS_Text_part0032.xhtml#REFe-r-17.14]). Although these studies coveronly a single aspect of the diverse neuroendocrine mechanisms that modulateescape behavior, the findings of the few field studies are as predicted from ourknowledge of the physiological underpinnings of other aspects of escape behaviorgained from laboratory studies. This suggests that other previously identifiedneuroendocrine mechanisms of escape behaviors may similarly affect FID andperhaps other aspects of escape in the field. An almost entirely unexploredavenue of research, that promises to be extremely fruitful, awaits futureinvestigation.17.5 THE IMPORTANCE OF SENSORY PHYSIOLOGYAs Chapter 12 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#CN-bp-12] so clearly demonstrated, afundamental understanding of sensory physiology is important to create realisticassumptions when modeling escape decisions. Tyrrell and Fernández-Juricicclearly showed us in Chapter 12 [OEBPS_Text_part0026.xhtml#CN-bp-12] how it isessential to understand, at a fundamental level, what animals can see, hear, andsmell, if we are to understand how they make escape decisions. For instance, itis essential to know about an animal’s visual field to properly understand ifindividuals engaged in searching for food pay a cost in terms of reducedvigilance. This reminds us that models of decision-making may be flawed ifassumptions do not properly capture sensory constraints on acquisition ofinformation. These warnings should stimulate considerable work, and it will beexciting to see its outcomes.17.6 UTILITY, RANGE, AND TESTABILITY OF THEORYThe escape theory described extensively in Chapter 2[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#CN-bp-2] provides the basis for predicting effects ofmany factors discussed in later chapters. The economic models of FID and hidingtime, including optimality models and other models in which escape and hidingdecisions are based on costs and benefits of fleeing, have been very successfulin the sense that their predictions have been broadly supported for many factorsaffecting escape by diverse prey taxa. Despite their successes, current modelsare limited in scope, and critical tests to distinguish between predictions ofalternative models have not been forthcoming.Current escape models describe decisions about escape behavior for only limitedaspects of the range of predator–prey interactions that are the most amenable toempirical study. They apply primarily to decisions to flee by an immobile preymonitoring a predator as it approaches and to emerge from refuge after someinterval spent hiding. Recently, the latency to flee from an immobile predatorby an immobile prey has been modeled successfully. In Chapter 2[OEBPS_Text_part0012.xhtml#CN-bp-2] these models are extended to anotherscenario in which the prey approaches the predator and the more complex scenarioin which both predator and prey are moving is discussed, but models of thesescenarios remain to be tested. Indeed, the latter scenario will be moredifficult to study than the others, and will likely require video and computerequipment to measure movements of predator and prey simultaneously. Currenteconomic models also do not predict escape strategies or changes in strategydiscussed in the chapter on escape strategy (Chapter 8[OEBPS_Text_part0020.xhtml#CN-bp-8]) and some of the taxonomically orientedchapters. These will be important topics for future theoretical exploration.Two types of models, some with extensions, have been used to predict decisionsinvolving distance and time. Ydenberg and Dill’s (1986[OEBPS_Text_part0032.xhtml#REFe-r-17.19]) original graphical escape modelpredicted that prey flee when the cost of not fleeing equals the cost offleeing. This model was later adapted by Martín and López (1999[OEBPS_Text_part0032.xhtml#REFe-r-17.12]) to predict hiding time in a refuge.Cooper and Frederick (2007a [OEBPS_Text_part0032.xhtml#REFe-r-17.8],b[OEBPS_Text_part0032.xhtml#REFe-r-17.9]) developed optimality models for bothFID and hiding time. In the optimality models, prey make decisions that affordthem greater fitness at the end of the encounter than do the other models.Although the quantitative predictions of the two types of models differ, we arecurrently unable to perform the critical tests needed to choose the better sortof model because we have not measured the effects of relevant variables onfitness, which is the currency of all of these models. In studies of escapebehavior, behavioral ecologists are confronted by the same inability to measurefitness, and therefore the same inability to adequately test quantitativepredictions, that has plagued fitness-based models in studies of foraging andother behaviors. A second general problem that applies to all current escapemodels is that animals may not be capable of making decisions that are exactlyoptimal or of determining the exact distance between predator and prey. It is tobe expected that they reach approximations of such decisions by using rules ofthumb to gauge predation risk (Bouskila & Blumstein 1992[OEBPS_Text_part0032.xhtml#REFe-r-17.4]), cost of fleeing, and their own initialfitness.Despite these handicaps, both types of models are useful. The mathematicalfunctions implied by their graphs, or stated explicitly by their equations, wereselected to meet some criteria for the escape and hiding scenarios. However,they are merely illustrative because the shapes of the fitness functions areunknown. Therefore empirical determinations of the distance and time functionscannot distinguish between the models. New methods are needed to measure fitnessdirectly or to equate fitness units among variables such as cost of fleeing,cost of not fleeing, and initial fitness. One of the most difficult challengesfor empiricists using escape theory will be to untangle the effects of factorssuch as body size, autotomy, and female reproductive status on multiplevariables in the models.Fortunately, the models are very useful despite these limitations. Thequalitative predictions of both models are similar with slight alterations ofthe original graphical models to incorporate the effect of the prey’s fitness atthe start of a predator–prey encounter. Tests of the qualitative predictionssupport the models equally well. They continue to provide useful frameworks forfuture advances in understanding effects of numerous factors on escape behaviorand seem well suited for extensions predicting simultaneous effects of multiplevariables and modification to make predictions for other escape variables andchanges in escape strategy.17.7 APPLICATION TO WILDLIFE CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENTThe application of escape behavior to improve wildlife conservation andmanagement, the last major theme of this chapter, is an important field that hasalready begun to yield insights and can be expected to produce more useful aidsto conservation and wildlife management. The chapters in this volume have shown,in exquisite detail, how the rules dictating when and how to escape are theoutcome of natural selection and sexual selection that have traded off costs andbenefits of escape. Such rules have evolved to be “optimal” in the environmentin which they were selected. Sadly, humans have had a remarkably huge impact onthe natural world. Animals may now find themselves in situations where olddecision rules are no longer adaptive (Candolin & Wong 2012[OEBPS_Text_part0032.xhtml#REFe-r-17.5]; Gill & Brumm 2014[OEBPS_Text_part0032.xhtml#REFe-r-17.10]). Such evolutionary mismatches haveconsequences for fitness.Thus, there is a need to properly understand the environmental drivers ofdecisions about escape. Doing so may permit us to understand and identify whichkey environmental drivers (such as habitat type, predator density or diversity,patch size, food type, etc.) have a disproportionate impact on escape behavior.Much of the field of conservation behavior is focused on managing decisionsindividuals make. Thus armed with this knowledge we may identify what toconserve or manage.However, knowledge of escape behavior can be used more directly. As has beendiscussed elsewhere (Blumstein & Fernández-Juricic 2010[OEBPS_Text_part0032.xhtml#REFe-r-17.3]), by quantifying AD and FID, we candevelop set-back zones that aim to reduce the impact of humans on sensitivewildlife. Physiological effects of being approached and of escaping on prey maybecome important considerations in the establishment of set-back distances. Byunderstanding the costs and benefits of hiding, we can begin to quantifydisturbance in ways that may be particularly useful to managers tasked withreducing human impacts on sensitive wildlife.17.8 CONCLUSIONSThe questions we ask about escape are not without controversy. As our chapter onbest practice (Chapter 16 [OEBPS_Text_part0031.xhtml#CN-bp-16]) illustrates,there are unresolved methodological questions. And there are unresolvedmechanistic hypotheses. For instance, what is the magnitude of attentionalcosts? Is the flush early and avoid the rush (FEAR) hypothesis supported? Whichtheoretical models best describe prey behavior? We hope that the rapid rate thatnew results are generated will, in another decade, allow us to look back and notonly have answers to some of these and more questions, but also have developednew and unforeseen questions.We have written much about escape behavior in the hope that it will beinteresting to you, our readers, and to provide enough information to stimulatenew research. We know that the book will have some heuristic value becausewriting and editing it has given us many new ideas, some of which we havealready begun to explore. Our overarching goal has been to present theinformation, but we have neglected to convey a major motivation that drives ourwork. The sheer joy of developing new ideas, designing experiments andobservational studies, analyzing data statistically to test predictions, writingto share our findings, are our rewards, as well as working with colleagues atall of these stages of the scientific process. New ideas flow when writing aboutthe findings. For many of us, the most exciting times are spent in the field inbeautiful natural habitats. Enough writing: it’s clearly time to get back intothe field, scare some animals, and reveal the wonderful complexity by whichanimals escape their predators!REFERENCESBerger, S., Wikelski, M., Romero, L.
