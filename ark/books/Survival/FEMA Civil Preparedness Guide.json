Therefore, it is imperative that each level of government build a Continuity of Government (COG) capability to preserve, maintain, and/or reconstitute its ability to function under the threat or occurrence of any emergency that could disrupt government operations and services. The development of a COG capability involves a series of requirements that, when met, will reasonably ensure that capability to preserve civil government institutions and effectively under emergency conditions. preparedness and planning the government has the perform essential functions This Civil Preparedness Guide (CPG) supports the Integrated Emergency Management System approach to multihazard emergency operations planning. This CPG amplifies the COG capability indicators contained in CPG l-35, Hazard Identification, Capability Assessment, and Multi-Year Development Plan for Local Governments, and CPG l-36, Capability Assessment and Multi-Year Development Plan for State Governments. The preparedness and planning considerations detailed are intended to complement and supplement the planning guidance contained in CPG l-8, Guide for Development of State and Local Emergency Operations Plans, and CPG l-8A, Guide for the Review of State and Local Emergency Operations Plans. This CPG clarifies the COG considerations that apply to State and local governments and quantifies the specific planning and preparedness measures that warrant con- sideration.

Purpose. This Civil Preparedness Guide (CPG) provides guidance and procedures for the preparedness and planning requirements (succession, predelegation of emergency authorities, emergency operating centers (EOC's), alternate EOC's, emergency action steps, protection of vital records, and the protection of government resources, personnel, and facilities) associated with Continuity of Government (COG) responsibilities. Elected and appointed government officials and emergency managers should use this guide to assess the jurisdiction's COG status, identify deficiencies, and prepare a remedial action plan to correct deficiencies. l-2. Applicability and Scope. a. Applicability. The provisions of this CPG are applicable to State and local government officials responsible for the protection of citizens, the continuation and reconstitution of government functions, and the restoration and recovery of public and private property. These officials, to the greatest extent possible, should ensure that their jurisdiction's laws, emergency operations plans (EOP's), and individual agency and organizational standard operating procedures (SOP's) that support the EOP thoroughly address COG requirements. b. Scope. The rat-ionale for COG is based on the nuclear attack threat. The dimensions of the problem related to support of the population after an attack will overwhelm a government's capability to respond unless it is pre- & pared to deal with the situation. The guidance contained in this CPG should be used to heighten the awareness of State and local officials on the importance of COG. Preparedness and planning considerations should be addressed on a daily basis as a fundamental part of the jurisdiction's emergency operations planning process. In order for a jurisdiction to attain a viable COG capability, the following actions associated with COG preparedness and planning must be satisfied: (1) Provisions to ensure continued leadership and preservation of records, thereby maintafning a viable system of government supported by law; (2) The establishment of appropriate emergency authorities legally vested in government leaders so that they have prescribed powers to act; (3) Provisions to ensure the survivability of mechanisms and systems for direction and control so that actions directed by leaders can be communicated and coordinated; and (4) The capability to sustain essential emergency services and resources so that critical response and recovery actions can achieve the widest possible implementation, thereby ensuring support to the public.

Continuity of Government is directly concerned with the provisions of essential support services to the civilian population while assuring the survivability of the American constitutional and democratic form of government. During a national emergency, the continuation of Federal Government operations is not practical or possible unless such operations are directly supported by resources and information from State and local governments. Accordingly, national viability is dependent on the stability and survivability of State and local government institutions which, with the Federal institutions, share the constitutional responsibility to preserve the lives and property of the people. Most emergencies do not threaten the institutional integrity of State or local governments. However, the consequence of some major emergencies such as nuclear attack, catastrophic earthquake, hurricane, or terrorist attack could disrupt State and local governments' ability to function. Consequently, if a government is not prepared, most if not all of its critical executive, legislative, and judicial functions could be severely degraded. This situation could create a climate that could make the jurisdiction vulnerable to anarchy, lawlessness, and chaos. CH l-3 l-2"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"July 27, 1987 CPG l-10 CHAPTER 2 Continuity of Government Planning and Preparedness Considerations 2-l. Purpose. This chapter outlines the basic COG needs for State and local governments. It details the specific preparedness and planning measures that should be addressed to ensure that the government can preserve, maintain, or reconstitute its ability to carry out executive, legislative, and judicial functions under the threat or occurrence of any emergency condition that could disrupt such functions and services. The speciffc preparedness and planning measures have been separated into seven separate categories in order to provide the user of this CPG a practical means to assess the jurisdiction's COG status and to identify specific deficiencies that require remedial attention. 2-2. Introduction. COG preparedness and planning provisions for the Federal level of Government have been thoroughly provided for under the Constitution, Federal statutes, Executive orders, plans, and Federal agency SOP's. Similar provisions and guidance for State and local governments have not been addressed at the Federal level for over 20 years. Consequently, State and local govern- ments have found it necessary to formulate their strategies for dealing with COG needs on an independent basis without the benefit of much Federal assistance. This has made it difficult for State and local governments to determine the adequacy of their COG provisions. 2-3. Relationship of the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial Functions. During the response and recovery periods generated by emergencies stemming from any of the threats associated with a national emergency or peacetime catastrophic disaster situation, the following tasking assigned to key members of the executive branch and the vital emergency functions associated with the legislative and judicial branches of State and local governments becomes critical: a. Executive. The executive system which provides for the day-to-day management and functioning of State and local governments must be sustained through recovery and reconstitution. The executive is responsible for implementing emergency response operations and is necessary to maintain the system of checks and balances with other branches of government. Elements of the State/local executive system are discussed below. (1) State Governor. The position of State Governor is critical to the continuity of Federal, State, and local levels of government. Usually, the following emergency powers and authorities are vested by law in the Office of the Governor: (a> Direction over State operational forces; (b) Declaration of a state of emergency as a basis to impose curfew, to evacuate, to restrict movement, to quarantine, to condemn, to declare powers of eminent domain, etc.; and CH 2-1 2-1"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"CPG l-10 July 27, 1987 (c) Authority to make appointments or to designate potential appointees for vacated offices in the U.S. Congress, State departments and local government (elected positions), ti agencies, State legislature (elected & positions), and State judicial system. (2) Heads of State Departments, Agencies, and Bureaus. Heads of State departments, agencies, and bureaus responsible for emergency preparedness, response, recovery, and restoration of services are essential to manage execution of gubernatorial directives. They are also essential to direct critical support services and to provide State emergency services and resources required by the public. Responsibilities of these State entities may be technical or operational in nature, but each entity has its own appropriate emergency powers and authorities. Maintaining leadership to exercise these powers during emergencies is critical. (3) Local Chief Executive. The position of local chief executive varies from State to State. In some local government structures, the chief executive is elected and singular--i.e., mayor, county executive, or county judge. Under a governing board of elected supervisors or under a council, the chief executive is one of the members of that body or is an appointed manager or chief administrator. Regardless of the form of local government, it is essential that a single authority be recognized to execute direction and control and emergency powers and that succession to office under emergency conditions be clearly prescribed. b. Legislative. Laws provide the legal authority, requirements, and proscriptions under which public officials carry out their responsibilities and democratic societies function. The legislative system is important in the W preparedness phase to legislate emergency powers and authorities and must be sustained through recovery and reconstitution to provide authority for implemen- tation of necessary government actions not otherwise authorized by the law. It is also essential to maintaining the system of checks and balances with other branches of government. The order of succession for State and local chief executives under emergency conditions must be established pursuant to law. c. Judicial. The judicial system is clearly a critical element of government because it implements due process and other basic tenets of the American form of government. The judicial system must be sustained through recovery and reconstitution and is necessary to maintain the system of checks and balances with other branches of government. 2-4. Preparedness and Planning Considerations. The preparedness and planning considerations enumerated in this CPG are based on the seven elements of COG that are contained in EO 11490. This EO details the specific requirements that apply to the Federal level of Government. These elements have been modified in this CPG to meet the needs of State and local governments. The CH 2-3a(l)(t) 2-2"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"July 27, 1987 CPG l-10 elements listed in paragraph 2-5 address the specific measures and provisions that should be satisfied in order to provide the jurisdiction with a viable U COG capability. Each element is accompanied by a definition, objective statement, preparedness and planning standard, and supporting criteria which identify the specific considerations that apply to the element. The prepared- ness and planning criteria associated with each element have been organized in a manner to facilitate assessment of the status of the jurisdiction's COG capability. a. The user of this CPG should review each criterion entry and determine if the appropriate action has been taken to satisfy the jurisdiction's require- ment(s) associated with the criterion. The columns that are adjacent to each of the evaluation criteria should be used to reflect and record the jurisdic- tion's status on each criterion. These columns have been subdivided so that the planning and preparedness status related to each criterion can be easily identified. An \"S\" placed in the YES column would indicate that the criterion has been satisfactorily handled. A \"V\" placed in the NO column would indicate a capability void. A \"D\" placed in the NO column would indicate a specific deficiency. A capability void means the criterion has not been addressed. A specific deficfency means that some measures described in this chapter have been taken to address the criterion but further action is necessary. Each time a \"D\" is placed in the NO column a short statement that explains the nature of the deficiency should be entered in the comments column. If the criterion is not applfcable to the jurisdiction, enter N/A in the comments column. b. For each criterion that is identified as void or deficient, the user of this CPG should initiate the appropriate action to correct the problem. .* Corrective action may require a simple change to the jurisdiction's EOP or agency'slorganization's SOP's. However, in some cases extensive revisions and/ or additions to the jurisdiction's laws may be necessary. In those situations which require legislative action, the user must ensure that the senior elected and appointed leadership in the jurisdiction is aware of the need for change. Accordingly, extensive coordination with the appropriate elements/staff members of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government and interested elements of the public sector is essential. 2-5. Preparedness and Planning Elements. a. The user of this CPG must remember that the planning and preparedness considerations contained in this CPG are intended to be incorporated in the emergency operations planning process. Therefore, corrective actions to fix COG deficiencies are a fundamental part of the jurisdiction's effort to build and maintain a viable emergency response mechanism. b. The following elements identify the COG considerations for which State and local jurisdictions should make provisions, as appropriate, in their laws, EOP's, organization and agency SOP's that support the EOP, exercise and training activities, and other activities. Planning considerations that relate to the EOP complement those already addressed in CPG l-8A.

Deficiency Identification. The large majority of States and local jurisdictions that objectively complete the self-assessment process provided by this CPG will find that they have significant deficiencies with respect to COG. Some may be quickly and easily remedied. Others may be resolved only with difficult, expensive, and long-term actions. Given this circumstance, it is recommended that each jurisdiction develop a remedial action plan tailored to its needs. b. Remedial Action Plan. The purpose of this plan is to facilitate and simplify the decisionmaking process that should be used to determine when and how the jurisdiction's COG deficiencies will be corrected. The plan should provide the user a means to thoroughly examine all identified deficiencies; consolidate related deficiencies into common groups (e.g., EOP/SOP, laws, etc.); - - CH 2-5(7)(d)(i)k 2-14"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"July 27, 1987 CPG l-10 and establish a priority for the correction of deficiencies. In order to ensure that a comprehensive plan is developed, it is recommended that the following corrective action steps be taken. This approach, however, is only a model, and users may develop their own corrective action steps if desired since there are a variety of other strategies for correcting COG deficiencies that will be equally effective: (1) Step 1. IJpon completion of the review of the planning and preparedness considerations listed In this CPG, the reviewer should assign each defici.ency to one of the following deficiency groups. This activity provides the reviewer a method to visually examine the scope of the jurisdiction's defici.encies: (a) EOP/SOP; (b) Laws; (c) Equipment and Facilities; (d) Exercise; (e) Training; and (f) Other. (2) Step 2. Once the deficiencies have been categorized, it will be necessary to set a priority for correcting the deficiencies in each group. At a minimum, the Eollowing factors should be considered when ranking deficiencies: (a) Impact of the deficiency on the jurisdiction's COG capability; (b) Estimate of the time required to correct the deficiency; cc> Estfmate of the cost and/or amount of resources needed to correct the deficiency; and (d) Amount of difficulty associated with correcting the deficiency (e.g., changing a local EOP may be simple but a revision/change to the State law will be time consuming and difficult). (3) Step 3. Prepare a corrective action log. This log should contain a short description of each deficiency, a synopsis of the corrective actions planned, and the estimated completion date for correcting each deficiency. Examples of corrective actions include the following: briefings and training for public officials to enhance their awareness of COG considerations; public information to increase public understanding and support for COG objectives; incorporation of COG considerations into plans on a continuing basis; designa- tion of and planning for the use of interim EOC's and AEOC's; promotion of and participation in legislative programs as appropriate; and participation in studies to determine requirements for EOC's and AEOC's adequate to support COG. (4) Step 4. Brief senior decision makers on the content distilled from steps 1-3. Normally, some or all of these officials will have been consulted when steps 2 and 3 were completed.
