Each element produces terror in its victims. The policy of the United States is summarized as follows: l All terrorist acts are criminal and intolerable, whatever their motivation, and should be condemned. l The U.S. will support all lawful measures to prevent terrorism and bring those responsible to justice. l No concessions will be made to terrorist extortion, because to do so only invites more terrorist action. l When Americans are abducted overseas, the U.S. will look to the host government to exercise its responsibility to protect all persons within its territories, to include achieving the safe release of hostages. l The U.S. will maintain close and continuous contact with the host government during the incident and will continue to develop international cooperation to combat terrorism."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 1-2 Strategy Terrorism is a criminal act that influences an audience beyond the immediate victim. The strategy of terrorists is to commit acts of violence that draw the attention of the local populace, the govern- ment, and the world to their cause. Terrorists plan their attack to obtain the greatest publicity, choosing targets that symbolize what they oppose. The effectiveness of the terrorist act lies not in the act itself, but in the public’s or government’s reaction to the act. For example, at the 1972 Munich Olympics, the Black September Organization killed 11 Israelis. The Israelis were the immediate victims. But the true target was the estimated 1bil lion people watching the televised event. The Black September Organization used the high visibility of the Olympics to publicize its views on the plight of the Palestinian refugees. Similarly, in October 1983, Middle Eastern terrorists bombed the Marine Battalion Landing Team Headquarters at Beirut Interna- tional Airport. Their immediate victims were the 241 U.S. mili- tary personnel who were killed and over 100 others who were wounded. Their true target was the American people and the U.S. Congress. Their one act of violence influenced the United States’ decision to withdraw the Marines from Beirut and was therefore considered a terrorist success. On 11 September 2001, terrorists skyjacked U.S. commercial planes and crashed two planes into the World Trade Center in New York City and one into the Pentagon in Washington D.C. The terrorist attacks inflicted serious loss of life by destroying the World Trade Center towers and part of the Pentagon building. They were designed to strike a blow at the American will and its"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 1-3 economic and military structure. Although the attacks succeeded in hitting their targets, they galvanized the will of the American public to take political, financial, and military actions to combat terrorism. Perspectives There are three perspectives of terrorism: the terrorist’s, the vic- tim’s, and the general public’s. The phrase “one man’s terrorist is another man’s freedom fighter” is a view terrorists themselves would accept. Terrorists do not see themselves as evil. They believe they are legitimate combatants, fighting for what they believe in, by whatever means possible. A victim of a terrorist act sees the terrorist as a criminal with no regard for human life. The general public’s view is the most unstable. The terrorists take great pains to foster a “Robin Hood” image in hope of swaying the general public’s point of view toward their cause. Today’s Threat Many areas of the world are experiencing great political, eco- nomic, and social unrest. The reasons for this unrest can be seen in conflicts with neighboring states, inter nal strife, dissatisfac- tion with governments in power, unconstrained population growth, declining resources, and ethnic and religious hatreds. This unrest has spawned numerous groups that lack the means to have their grievances solved by their own governments through the normal political processes. Sometimes these groups resort to terrorism to achieve their aims. Generally, these aims stem from political ideology, nationalism, religion or special interests."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 1-4 Over the past 20 years, terrorists have committed extremely vio- lent acts for alleged political or religious reasons. Political ideol- ogy ranges from the far left to the far right. For example, the far left can consist of groups such as Marxists and Leninists who pro- pose a revolution of workers led by a revolutionary elite. On the far right, are dictatorships that typically believe in a merging of state and business leadership. Nationalism is the devotion to the interests or culture of a group of people or a nation. Typically, nationalists share a common ethnic background and wish to establish or regain a homeland. Religious extremists often reject the authority of secular govern- ments and view legal systems that are not based on their religious beliefs as illegitimate. They often view modernization efforts as corrupting influences on traditional culture. Special interest groups include people on the radical fringe of many legitimate causes such as antiabortion views, animal rights, radical environmentalism. These groups believe that violence is morally justifiable to achieve their goals. Types of Terrorist Incidents The following figure provides a spectrum of terrorist incidents, from the most common to the least common."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 1-5 Bombings Bombings are the most common type of terrorist act. Typically, improvised explosive devices are inexpensive and easy to make. Modern devices are smaller and harder to detect. They contain very destructive capabilities; for example, on 07August 1998, two American embassies in Africa were bombed. The bombings claimed the lives of over 200 people, including 12 innocent American citizens, and injured over 5,000 civilians. Terrorists can also use materials readily available to the average consumer to construct a bomb. For example, on 19April 1995, the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, OK, was bombed, and 168 people were killed by an improvised explosive device. In the case of the 11 September 2001 attacks, terrorists skyjacked commercial planes, laden with full fuel tanks, to fly them into"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 1-6 buildings as guided missiles or massive flying bombs. This awak- ened the world to a new level of terrorist bombing efforts. Kidnappings and Hostage-Takings Terrorists use kidnappings and hostage-takings to establish a bar- gaining position and elicit publicity. Although kidnapping is one of the most difficult acts for a terrorist group to accomplish, if it is successful, it can gain terrorists money, release of jailed com- rades, and publicity for an extended period of time. Hostage-taking involves the seizure of a facility or location and the taking of hostages. Unlike a kidnapping, hostage-tak- ing provokes a confrontation with authorities. It forces author- ities to either make dramatic decisions or to comply with the terrorist’s demands. Hostage-taking is overt and designed to attract and hold media attention. The terrorists’ intended target is the audience affected by the hostage’s confinement, not the hostage himself. Armed Attacks and Assassinations Armed attacks include raids and ambushes. Assassinations are the killing of a selected victim, usually by bombings or small arms. Drive-by shootings are a common technique employed by loosely organized terrorist groups. Historically, terrorists have assassi- nated specific individuals for psychological effect. Arsons and Firebombings Incendiary devices are cheap and easy to hide. Arson and fire- bombings are easily conducted by terrorist groups that may not be"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 1-7 as well-organized, equipped or trained as a major terrorist organi- zation. Arsons or firebombings against utilities, hotels, govern- ment buildings or industrial centers are common tactics used by terrorists to portray an image that the ruling government is inca- pable of maintaining order. Hijackings and Skyjackings Hijacking is the seizure by force of a surface vehicle, its passen- gers, and/or its cargo. Skyjacking is the taking of an aircraft, which creates a mobile, hostage barricade situation. It provides terrorists with hostages from many nations and draws heavy media attention. Skyjacking also provides mobility for the terrorists to relocate the aircraft to a country that supports their cause and provides them with a human shield, making retaliation difficult. On 11 September 2001, commercial airplanes were skyjacked but only to gain control of the aircraft. The terrorists’ intent was not to create a hostage barricade situation, but to ensure the passengers did not interfere with their desire to crash the aircraft into their intended targets. Other Types of Terrorist Incidents In addition to the acts of violence discussed, numerous other types of violence exist under the framework of terrorism. Terror- ist groups conduct maimings against their own people as a form of punishment for security violations, defections or informing. Terrorist organizations also conduct robberies and extortion when they need to finance their acts and are without sponsorship from sympathetic nations."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 1-8 Cyberterrorism is a new, increasing form of terrorism that targets computer networks. Cyberterrorism allows terrorists to conduct their operations with little or no risk to themselves. It also pro- vides terrorists an opportunity to disrupt or destroy networks and computers. The result is interruption of key government or busi- ness-related activities. Although this type of terrorism lacks a high profile compared to other types of terrorist attacks, its impact is just as destructive. Historically, terrorist attacks using nuclear, biological, and chem- ical (NBC) weapons have been rare. Due to the extremely high number of casualties that NBC weapons produce, NBC weapons are also referred to as weapons of mass destruction (WMD). A number of nations are involved in arms races with neighboring countries because they view the development of WMD as a key deterrent of attack by hostile neighbors. The increased develop- ment of WMD also increases the potential for terrorist groups to gain access to WMD. It is believed that in the future terrorists will have greater access to WMD because unstable nations or states may fail to safeguard their stockpiles of WMD from acci- dental losses, illicit sales or outright theft or seizure. Determined terrorist groups can also gain access to WMD through covert independent research efforts or by hiring techni- cally skilled professionals to construct them. Although an explo- sive nuclear device is believed beyond the scope of most terrorist groups, chemical, biological or radiological dispersion weapons that use nuclear contaminants are not. An example of a terrorist group gaining access to WMD was trag- ically evident on 20 March 1995. A Japanese religious cult, Aum Shinrikyo or Supreme Truth, chemically attacked Japanese citi- zens in the Tokyo subway system. Use of the nerve agent Sarin resulted in 12 deaths and 5,500 hospitalizations."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 1-9 In October of 2001, several letters were mailed to selected U.S. Government and media individuals. Those letters contained the biological agent anthrax. In large amounts or even small amounts widely distributed, such biological agents can be a WMD. Fear of these biological agents can create as much terrorist value as their actual employment. Intentions of Terrorist Groups l Produce widespread fear. l Obtain worldwide, national or local recognition for their cause by attracting the attention of the media. l Harass, weaken, or embarrass government security forces so that the government overreacts and appears repressive. l Steal or extort money and equipment, especially weapons and ammunition. l Destroy facilities or disrupt lines of communication in order to create doubt that the government can provide for and protect its citizens. l Discourage foreign investments, tourism or assistance pro- grams that can affect the target country’s economy and sup- port of the government in power. l Influence government decisions, legislation or other critical decisions. l Free prisoners. l Satisfy vengeance."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 1-10 l Turn the tide in a guerrilla war by forcing government security forces to concentrate their efforts in urban areas. This allows the terrorist groups to establish themselves among the local populace in rural areas. General Characteristics of Terrorist Groups l Seek to intimidate by promoting fear. l Some have advanced weaponry (e.g., tanks) but generally they are militarily weaker than the governments they fight. l Employ unconventional warfare tactics; training can include physical and mental preparation, weapons and explosives, political and religious indoctrination, combat tactics, intelli- gence, psychological warfare, survival, and communications. l Do not equate tactical success with mission success. A specific terrorist act may not achieve its desired results, but a terrorist may still view the act as successful if it publicizes the cause. l Usually urban-based and highly mobile. If urban-based, ter- rorists have access to mass transportation (e.g., airplanes, ships, railroads, and subways). Terrorist groups with interna- tional contacts may also have access to forged passports and safehavens in other countries. l Generally organize and operate clandestinely in cells of three to five members. A cell may only have contact with another cell or the next higher command level. Therefore, the capture of one or more terrorists rarely results in the compromised identity of the entire terrorist organization."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 1-11 Crime Prevention Measures Although this publication is oriented to protecting Marines and their family members from terrorists, measures discussed in the following chapters are generally applicable to protection from crime as well. As an American, you must be careful when travel- ling at home or abroad. Crime is a more common threat to most military personnel than terrorism, however, the threat of terrorism has a far greater impact on national security. You can narrow the chances of becoming a victim by increased awareness of potential problems and careful planning. Practicing sound individual pro- tective measures makes you a “hard target.”"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Chapter 2 Protection Through Awareness Types of Targets Terrorists prefer a target that involves little risk and a high probabil- ity of success. Terrorists evaluate a target’s security profile, predict- ability, and value. The target’s value is determined by its importance and possible benefits gained. Once a target has been evaluated by terrorists, the target is labeled in the terrorist’s mind as either a soft or a hard target. Soft Targets Soft targets are accessible, predictable, and unaware. They make it easy for strangers to access their private information (e.g., phone numbers, addresses, schedules). Soft targets follow consistent rou- tines at home and at work, allowing terrorists to predict a target’s movements in advance. Soft targets are unaware of their surround- ings and do not employ individual protective measures. Hard Targets Hard targets are inaccessible, unpredictable, and aware. They make it difficult for terrorists to gain access to themselves or their fami- lies. Hard targets consciously vary their routines and avoid setting patterns in their daily life. They are security conscious, aware of their surroundings, and proactively adhere to individu al protective measures. Hard targets do not — l Put their names on mailboxes or exterior walls of their homes. l Run or walk daily at the same time of day or to the same place."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 2-2 l Wash cars, mow lawns or have family cookouts the same day every week. l Shop the same day of each week at the same store. l Travel to and from home on the same route and at the same time of day. l Attend church services at the same time of day and place each week. l Sit in the same seat in a vehicle, restaurant, church, etc. l Arrive at work, go to lunch, depart work at the same time of day every day. l Pick up the newspaper or mail at the same time of day every day. l Walk or feed the dog along the same route or at the same time of day every day. l Patronize the same restaurants or bars or patronize only Amer- ican restaurants or bars. l Park vehicles in the same area at church, social events, etc. l Earn the reputation of always lending a helping hand, e.g., aiding “victims” at “staged” roadside accidents. Identification of the Threat Learn about your destination—the culture, language, local cus- toms, and history of terrorist/criminal activity—as soon as you know that you’re going to be travelling outside the United States. Information is available from the following sources: l Command’s antiterrorism/force protection (AT/FP) officer or S-2/intelligence officer."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 2-3 l Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) briefs and reports. l U.S. Defense Representative Force Protection Officer (usually the U.S. Embassy’s Defense Attache) or U.S. Embassy Regional Security Officer. l Country handbooks from the Marine Corps Intelligence Activity (MCIA). l U.S. State Department consular information sheets, public ser- vice announcements or travel warnings via the internet. l Other Services’ or other Government agencies’ manuals and web sites. (See Marine Corps Order [MCO] 3302.1C, The Marine Corps Antiterrorism/Force Protection [AT/FP] Pro- gram, for a listing of terrorism, law enforcement, and security information websites on the internet.) l Newspapers, magazines, books, travel agents or tourist offices. l People who currently live or have lived in the area. All commands are required to provide a Level I AT/FP briefing to all Marines, civilian employees, and family members deploying or travelling outside the U.S. on official orders. Level I briefings include an area of responsibility (AOR) specific threat briefing/ update for the area of travel. This brief stresses the need for a heightened awareness of the terrorist threat and reviews individ- ual protective measures that can reduce individual vulnerability. (See MCO 3302.1C for more details.) Once in-country, additional information is available from the U.S. Embassy and the host country; specifically: l Are the terrorist groups in the area active? l Are the terrorist groups organizing or reorganizing?"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 2-4 l What are the local populace’s attitudes towards the terrorist groups? l What are the local populace’s attitudes towards Americans? l Does the respective foreign government support, condone or condemn the terrorist activity? l What is the potential for violence? l What are the terrorists’ methods of operation? Generally, when a terrorist group is successful with a certain method of operation, the group reuses it or it will be used by other terrorist groups. However, just because a terrorist group has not used a specific tactic in the past does not mean they won’t develop new tactics or adopt similar tactics used by other terrorist groups. Visibility Be alert to your surroundings, know and respect local customs and laws. Don’t call undue attention to yourself. Be unpredictable by varying the days and times of your activities and by varying routes you usually travel.

Victims can be targeted for being an American, a very important person (VIP), someone associated with VIPs or a target of opportunity. Identified as an American You can protect yourself from becoming a target if you avoid say- ing, doing, wearing, using, displaying or driving anything that readily identifies you as an American. Even if the local populace does not see Americans on a daily basis, global commerce and communications provides them access to magazines, movies, television shows, and web sites that portray American lifestyles. The following paragraphs identify common indicators that easily identify Americans overseas. Uniforms Wear civilian clothes when traveling back and forth to work; change into your uniform after you arrive at work; and change into civilian clothes before you leave work. License Plates Americans serving overseas may be issued different colored license plates or a different number or letter indicator on their license plates. If possible, use local license plates on any automo- bile driven. Avoid using vanity license plates or license plates with U.S. Marine Corps logos. Dress Blend in with what the local populace or local tourist element wears. Flashy or trendy clothing can attract unwanted attention."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 2-6 Clothes should not clearly identify you as an American; for example, cowboy boots, American logo T-shirts, clothes bearing American sports teams, and expensive athletic shoes. Speech Although American dialect is hard to avoid, even if you speak the native language, avoid using military terminology and American slang. Customs and Habits Even if you physically blend in with the local populace, your cus- toms and habits can identify you as an American. If possible, you should adopt local or tourist customs and habits. Personal Behavior Some Americans have the tendency to be loud and obnoxious in the presence of the local populace. Another common mistake that Americans can make is to unnecessarily boast about American culture, wealth, technology, and military power, etc. in the pres- ence of foreign nationals. Strive to blend in as much as possible, and not draw attention to yourself. KEEP A LOW PROFILE , especially in a public environment or with the local media. Tattoos and Jewelry Wear a shirt that covers tattoos with military or civilian slogans or logos when you go out. Leave military jewelry— such as ser- vice rings, medallions, and watches—at home."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 2-7 Controversial Materials Avoid carrying potentially controversial materials such as gun magazines, military publications, religious books, pornography or magazines that can offend the local populace. Nationality Indicators American flags, decals, patches or logos easily identify you as an American. Avoid displaying them on your vehicles, clothes, in front of your home or place of employment. U.S. Government Bus Stops Do not wait for long periods of time at U.S. Government bus stops. When the bus approaches, walk toward the bus, stop short of the bus stop, and board the bus after the other passengers have boarded. Be especially observant for suspicious looking person- nel or objects such as unattended luggage or boxes. Currency Exchange a few U.S. dollars into the local currency before arriv- ing overseas. Use local currency and avoid carrying large amounts of money. Identified as Someone of Importance Many people, including terrorists, equate certain lifestyles with prominence. They believe that a prominent lifestyle is indicative of a person’s importance to his government or company. Ameri- cans, in particular, are often treated by host governments as VIPs out of respect. Whenever possible, avoid being treated as a VIP."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 2-8 Avoid using your rank, title or position when introducing yourself or signing your name. Strive to maintain a low profile and blend in with the local populace. The issues identified in the following subparagraphs give the impression of importance and therefore should be avoided. Expensive Cars People may think anyone who drives an expensive car is impor- tant. Avoid driving expensive vehicles. Drive the type of vehicle that is common to the area in which you are located. Staff Cars People may think that anyone driving around in a staff car from the American embassy must be important. Therefore, limit use of nonarmored staff cars. Bodyguards If you do not need bodyguards, do not use them. If you must have bodyguards, keep them to a minimum and ensure that they blend in with the other personnel around you—they should not be obvious. Ensure bodyguards pass a background check and are well trained. Chauffeurs Many people may believe that anyone who has a driver is a VIP. Therefore, perform your own driving if possible. If you do have a driver, the rear right seat is typically reserved for a VIP. There- fore, sit up front with the driver and occasionally rotate your seat position within the vehicle. You should also— l Ensure your driver has the required training so that he will not panic or freeze in a high pressure situation."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 2-9 l Develop an all-clear or distress signal (e.g., a hat or cigarette pack on the dash) between you and your chauffeur. A signal allows the driver to warn you of a problem prior to your approaching the vehicle. l Have the driver open the door for you. l Avoid giving your itinerary to your driver. All a driver needs to know is when and where to be. For example, you have the driver show up at 0700, but you do not leave until 0800. If possible, tell your driver your destination only after the car has started. Briefcases In some countries, people think anyone carrying a briefcase is considered important. If possible, avoid carrying a briefcase unless it is the norm for the area. If the local populace uses back- packs, then you should also use a backpack. License Plates and Decals If using diplomatic license plates, license plates with low num- bers, or decals is unavoidable, employ proactive individual pro- tective measures to reduce both vulnerability and visibility. Passports and Official Papers Diplomatic (black) and official (red) passports indicate someone of importance. Use a tourist (blue or green) passport whenever possible. If you use a tourist passport, consider placing your offi- cial passport, military ID, travel orders, and related documents in your checked luggage. If you must carry official documents on your person, select a hiding place onboard your aircraft, bus, boat or train to hide them in case of a highjacking. Try to memorize"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 2-10 your passport number and other essential information to avoid flashing this information in front of other passengers. While pass- ing through customs, keep your passport out of sight by placing it in your airline ticket pouch. Do not carry classified or official papers unless it is mission essential. Parking VIPs warrant their own parking spots usually very close to their offices, thus drawing attention to themselves and their impor- tance. Therefore, avoid using a designated parking space; instead, park in an unmarked parking space and rotate where you park your vehicle. Domestic Employees In many foreign countries domestic employees—such as maids, cooks, private guards, gardeners, and drivers—are very afford- able. However, domestic help can provide terrorists with critical access to you and your family. If you are considering employing domestic help, ask for letters of reference and obtain a back- ground check through the Embassy, if possible. l Avoid live-in domestic help. If they must have access to keys, never let them remove keys from the house. l Domestic employees should not allow anyone (including per- sons in police uniforms) to enter the house without permission from the family. l Avoid providing transportation to and from work for any domestic employees. Pay for a taxi or bus fare. l If a domestic employee calls in sick, do not accept the tempo- rary services of a relative (“cousin” or “sister”)."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 2-11 l Have domestic employees report potential terrorist surveil- lance of your residence and watch for anyone loitering in the area or repeatedly driving or walking by. l Pay domestic help well and give cash rewards for following your security rules. l Take special care to never discuss sensitive topics or detailed travel plans in their presence. Terrorists have successfully drawn this information from domestic employees in the past. Identified as a Target of Opportunity These are the headlines that millions of Americans were view- ing in June 1985 when four Marine U.S. Embassy guards became targets of opportunity for the Faribundo Marti Para la Libercion Nacional (FMLN) terrorist organization. These Marines were sitting outside of a very popular cafe in San Sal- vador when they were gunned down for being symbols of the"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 2-12 United States. When overseas, remember that you are a visual symbol of an American presence, values, prestige, and power. The longer you remain overseas, the more comfortable you may become. The more comfortable you become, the less you may think of yourself as a potential target. While overseas, never allow yourself to become complacent. Safeguard information concerning yourself, your home, job, and family. The more intelligence a terrorist can collect on you, the greater his chance of success. Terrorists gather their information from a variety of sources, which can include the following: l Various internet sources, including command web pages. l Aircraft loading manifests identify sending units, receiving units, departing facilities, and landing facilities. l Bills of lading provide names of people moving into and out of an area. l Immigration records provide names of people, dates of birth, and nationalities. l Unit rosters provide names, addresses and phone numbers of individuals, spouses, and dependents. Unit rosters should be controlled and not posted in plain view. l Manning boards provide an individual’s name, duty position, squad, platoon, etc.; some even have photographs. If possible, offices should avoid using manning boards. If these are a necessity, they should be covered when not in use and kept in a locked office during nonduty hours. Do not post them in front of the unit. l Billeting offices often maintain a listing of all housing assign- ments. Security managers must ensure that billeting offices establish procedures to prevent unauthorized disclosure of personal information."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 2-13 l Telephone directories provide an individual’s name, address, and phone number. If you must list your phone number in the telephone directory, request that only your name and number be included, not your address, rank or duty position. l Some units or schools publish a “Who’s Who” book. If possi- ble, avoid having your name listed in this type of publication. l Duty rosters for the staff duty, drivers, military details, etc., should not be posted in plain view. When they become obso- lete, they should be destroyed (not just thrown away). l Discarded mail or official correspondence can be used to identify an individual, the sender, and the place from which the correspondence was sent. Destroy any mail or official correspondence no longer needed and remove address labels from magazines. l The carbon from a credit card provides an individual’s name and account number. Use the currency of the country you are visiting or working in. If you must use a credit card, also request the carbon copy. l Checks can provide an individual’s name, address, phone number, and social security number. Have only minimal infor- mation printed on the front of your checks. l Nameplates make it easy to find an individual in an office environment; avoid their use, if possible. l Receipts from hotels, laundries, etc., identify an individual by name and often by room number. Consider using a nickname or an assumed name. l Luggage should be generic and civilian in nature. Avoid dis- playing your rank, unit patches, decals, or any American iden- tifiers on your luggage. l Remove all destination and baggage claim tags from luggage as well as stickers, decals, and other markings that reveal that"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 2-14 the luggage has been through U.S. Customs (e.g., custom’s stickers). l Be aware of all the documentation that contains information about your unit, yourself, and your family. Destroy all docu- mentation, especially trash, that could be used by terrorists as a source of information. Family Members Family members must be aware of the potential terrorist and criminal threat at home and abroad. They should also receive a Level I AT/FP brief that emphasizes the importance of individual protective measures and physical security. Ensure that your fam- ily members know and perform the following safeguards when traveling/living at home and abroad: l The threat risk for the area. l Where they are at all times. A simple orientation to the area could prevent them from straying into dangerous areas. l Keep the house locked and secured whenever leaving the house. Exercise caution upon return. Set up simple signals to alert family members or associates if there is danger. l Develop and practice emergency procedures for use in the home such as: n Evacuation due to fire. n Intruders in the residence upon arriving home. n Intruders breaking into the house."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 2-15 l Location and phone numbers of the U.S. Embassy, military base, neighbors, and all emergency services such as police, fire department, and medical services, and other safe locations for refuge or assistance. l Carry small cards with emergency phrases in the respective foreign language, and post these phrases by the telephone. l In preparation for emergencies, maintain survival items (e.g., supply of fresh water, nonperishable food, candles, lanterns, flashlights, extra batteries, blankets, portable radio, camping stove with spare fuel, axe, first aid kit, and other appropriate items). Consider maintaining a similar kit for your car for emergency situations in isolated areas. For more information see MCRP 3-02F/FM 21-76, Survival . l Take an ample supply of medications that family members use. Also keep a copy of the prescription, statement from a physician, and know the generic name of the medication so you can reorder it abroad. Also, keep eyeglass prescriptions on hand. l Always carry identification documents. Carry a card stating blood type and allergies to particular medications. The card should be bilingual/multilingual—English and the host nation language(s). Special Precautions for Children Kidnapping is a potential tool used to extort ransom money that finances terrorist organizations or may be used as an attempt to"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 2-16 force you to assist in a terrorist operation. Special precautions include the following: l Never leave children alone or unattended. Leave children only with responsible and trustworthy individuals capable of han- dling emergency situations. l Instruct children to keep doors and windows locked, and never to allow strangers into the house. Discourage children from answering the door, especially during hours of darkness. l If possible, locate children’s rooms in areas not easily accessi- ble from the outside. l Instruct children to never leave home without telling the par- ents. They should only travel in groups and avoid isolated areas especially when travelling to and from school. Accom- pany young children to and from bus stops, where necessary. l Children should only use locally approved play areas where recreational activities are supervised by responsible adults and where police protection is readily available. l Children should refuse automobile rides from strangers and refuse to accompany strangers anywhere on foot, even if a stranger says, “Your Mom/Dad sent me and said it was ok”. l Inform school authorities to never release children to any per- son who is not a family member. Instruct children to call home if a stranger is there to pick them up. l Children should be told to refuse gifts from strangers and to avoid providing information to strangers such as their name and where they live. l Children should immediately report anyone who attempts to approach them to the nearest person or authority (teacher, police)."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 2-17 l Instruct children not to discuss what you do and tell them to inform you if they are questioned about you by anyone. Home Physical Security Criminals remain the most likely threat in your home. However, terrorists have conducted operations at the homes of servicemen overseas. The following section provides some basic information to make your home a hard target. Develop a security plan that includes the following: l Operations Security. Don’t provide information to potential terrorists or criminals via the mail, phone, computer or trashcan. l Outer Security . Use available assets (local shop owners, neighbors, domestic employees, guards, family etc.) to detect potential surveillance. l Inner Security . Establish a warning system with pets, alarms, and motion sensors. l Barriers . Fences, walls, locked doors and windows, secure rooms to go to in an emergency. l Communications. Phone, cell phones, megaphones, inter- coms, radios, audible alarms, linked security systems. l Deterrent/Response Systems. Guards, pets, weapons (if authorized), and fire extinguishers. General l Change or re-key locks when you move in or when a key is lost by a family member. Maintain strict control of all keys. Change the security code in the garage door opener. Never"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 2-18 leave house or trunk key with your ignition key while your car is being serviced or parked by an attendant. l Don’t open doors to strangers. Observe them through a peep- hole viewer. Establish procedures for accepting deliveries such as: verifying identities of delivery person, checking the identity of the deliverer with the appropriate dispatcher, refus- ing all unexpected packages. l Allow maintenance work only on a scheduled basis. Unless a clear emergency exists. Be alert to people disguised as public utility crews, road workers, vendors etc., who might station themselves near the house to observe activities and gather information. l Note parked or abandoned vehicles near the entrance or walls of the residence. l Make residence appear occupied while you are away by using timers to control lights, TVs, and radios. n Ask neighbors to adjust blinds and draperies and pick up newspapers and mail. n Schedule regular lawn work. n Notify local law enforcement or military police if you will be away for an extended period. Residential Physical Security l Routinely keep all doors, skylights, roof doors, and windows locked. Keep all window curtains and blinds tightly closed after sundown. l Install lighting all around the house and yard; link to timers and sensors."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 2-19 l Ensure door frames, doors, locks, and bolts are of solid con- struction. Ensure door hinges exposed to outside of house are pinned or spot-welded to prevent removal of the hinge bolt. l Ensure fuse boxes are secure from tampering. l Remove all trees, poles, ladders, etc., that might help an intruder scale fences, walls or gain access to second floor win- dows. Remove dense foliage or shrubbery near gates, garages, windows or doors that might conceal an intruder. l Install intrusion detection, smoke, and fire alarms. Ensure intrusion detection alarms covers both the perimeter (doors and windows) and interior (motion and/or glass break sen- sors). Have the alarms monitored through a reputable security service or police. Train family members to use and test alarms regularly. l If possible, select and prepare an interior safe room for use in case of emergencies. The safe room should have a sturdy door with a lock and an emergency exit, if possible. Bathrooms on upper floors are generally good, safe rooms. l Store emergency and first aid supplies in the saferoom. Bars or grillwork on saferoom windows should be locked from the inside to expedite escape. l Keep keys to locks, a rope or chain ladder to ease escape, and a means of communication (e.g., cellular phone and radio transmitter. Telephones l Don’t place your name in a public local phone directory. l If you receive obscene, threatening or annoying phone calls or an unusual number of wrong or silent callers, report this to the police. Use caller-ID or call block, if available."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 2-20 l Answer the phone without providing any personal informa- tion. Be especially cautious when sending personal informa- tion over computer on-line services. l Report any interruption or unusual interference with phone, electrical or computer service. This could be the first indica- tion of “bugging” your phone line. l Keep a cellular phone charged and available, particularly at night. Letter Bombs and Biological Mailings Heightened personal security involves treating any suspicious- looking mail (letter or package) as a bomb or a potential biologi- cal threat. If you think any mail is suspicious, contact the military police or appropriate security officials and let them investigate. Do not attempt to handle the mail yourself. You should examine your mail for the following suspicious features: l It is from a stranger or an unknown place? l Is the return address missing? l Is there an excessive amount of postage? l Is the size excessive or unusual? l Does it have external wires or strings that protrude? l Is the spelling correct? l Does the return address and place of postmark match? l Does the handwriting appear to be foreign? l Does it smell peculiar? l Is it unusually heavy or light? l Is it unbalanced (lopsided)?"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 2-21 l Are there any oily, sticky or powdery substances on the outside of the letter or package? l Does it have springiness on the top, bottom or sides? You should use the following guidelines if you suspect that a piece of mail contains a bomb or biological agent: l Don’t panic. l Do not shake the empty contents of any suspicious envelope or package. If any powder or substance leaks out, do not attempt to clean it up. l Place the envelope or package in a plastic bag or some other type of container to prevent leakage of the contents. (If you do not have a container, cover the mail and do not remove the cover. If powder or any other substance has already leaked out, cover that also. You can cover the mail with clothing, paper, trash cans, etc.) l Leave the room and close the door. Secure the area to prevent others from entering. l Wash your hands with soap and water to prevent spreading any biological agent to your skin or respiratory system. l Report the incident to authorities. If at home, dial 911 and report the incident to your local law enforcement agency. If at work, report the incident to the governing law enforcement agency and notify your building security official or an avail- able supervisor. l List all of the people who were in the room or area when the suspicious mail was recognized. Give this list to both the local health authorities and law enforcement officials."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 2-22 All mail that is sent overseas should be delivered via Army/Fleet Post Offices or through the U.S. Embassy to allow for proper bomb detection and inspection by trained mail handlers. Vehicle Bomb Search A large number of terrorist attacks take place in or around a vehi- cle, typically by some sort of explosive device. This occurs because bombs are relatively easy to make and plant on exposed and unattended vehicles. You need to learn how to search a vehi- cle for tampering and to recognize danger signs. Appendix A contains procedures and tips for conducting a vehicle bomb search. By routinely inspecting your vehicle, you give the impres- sion of being a hard target. Travel Traveling is one of the most opportune times for a terrorist attack. You are the most vulnerable and predictable in the morning as you enter or leave your quarters, your place of work, or your vehicle. Your understanding and application of the following information can reduce your chances of becoming a victim of a terrorist attack while traveling:"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 2-23 General Precautions Remain alert; travel in groups or pairs in well-lighted, busy areas. Watch your luggage at all times. Use concealed bag tags. Establish alternate routes from each starting place to each destination. Make sure at least one person you work with and someone in your family are aware of these routes and the approximate time it takes you to travel these routes. Keep travel arrangements confidential as much as possible. Avoid using rank or military addresses on tickets, travel documents, and hotel reservations. Make a copy of the following and place in different pieces of luggage: passport, ID card, and official papers. If lost or stolen, these items can be replaced at a U.S. Embassy, Consulate or military facility. Register with the U.S. Embassy upon arrival in country either in person or via phone. Carry a card that has the location and phone number of U.S. military facilities and the U.S. Embassy and Consulates in the area. These are vital safehavens during emergencies. Maintain a low profile. Do not discuss your U.S. government affiliation with any other passengers. Get a detailed briefing from the Force Protection/S-2/intelligence officer on the cities you plan to visit. The briefing should include the threat, the safest routes to use, safehavens, areas to avoid, and anything else pertaining to your mission and safety. Avoid using public transportation. Buses and trains are preferred to a taxi. If you must travel in a taxi, specify the route you want the taxi driver to take and look for the photo identification or license to ensure that the photo matches the driver."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 2-24 Learn common phrases and greetings and how to ask for assistance or help in the local language. Know how to use public phones and carry enough change (in the local currency) to make a phone call. Calling cards can be used in many countries also. Learn the names and phone numbers of persons to contact at your destination, including emergency numbers. Safeguards while Driving Park your car for easy escape (pointed outwards). Lock your car and garage when you park overnight. Alternate use of parking garages if possible. Park in well lighted areas if you must park on the street. Walk to your car with keys in hand, ready to use. Perform a quick internal and external check of car. See appendix A for vehicle bomb check. Start your car immediately after conducting your vehicle bomb search. Do this before you adjust your seat or mirrors. You should be prepared for rapid escape if necessary. Lock your doors and keep your windows up. Wear your seatbelt. Avoid traveling alone and during late hours. Know where the dangerous areas in the city are and avoid them. Travel only on busy, well-traveled thoroughfares, especially routes that allow speeds over 25 mph. Most attacks occur in stop and go traffic. Avoid one-way streets and other choke points such as bridges, traffic circles, and narrow alleyways. Avoid isolated secondary roads."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 2-25 Enter and exit your vehicle at busy locations. Know en route safehavens such as police and fire stations, military posts, and checkpoints you can drive to. If you feel you are being followed, don’t go directly home. Avoid carrying classified material. If driving, lock classified materials in the trunk. Varying times and routes driving to and from work. If possible, use different building entrances and exits. Keep your vehicle in good mechanical condition and your gas tank at least half full. Ensure you have a locking gas cap. Keep safety equipment (e.g., cellular phone, fire extinguisher) inside your vehicle in good working order. Consider carrying a survival kit. (See MCRP 3-02F/FM 21-76, Survival. ) Avoid driving close behind other vehicles or in any situation where you can get boxed in or forced to a curb. Have an evasive plan ready. Sometimes making a simple U-turn is enough to get you out of danger. Keep at least one-half car length of empty space in front of your vehicle when stopped at traffic signals and stop signs. This gives you room to escape in a kidnapping or armed attack/assassination attempt. Never pick up hitchhikers. In an emergency, drive on flat tires until reaching a well-lighted, well-traveled area or safehaven."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 2-26 In the event of mechanical failure, set out warning triangles/ flares, raise the hood, activate emergency flashers, and stay inside. If someone stops to offer assistance, ask them to notify the police or road service. If you feel unsure of the situation, don’t get out of the car until the police or road service arrives. If you feel threatened by strangers, stay in the car with the doors locked. Use vehicle’s horn to attract attention. Safeguards while Walking Be alert to the possibility of surveillance. Before leaving a building or mode of transportation, check up and down the street for suspicious looking cars or individuals. Walk facing traffic at all times. Walk on the center of the sidewalk, this allows you to see around corners. Walking next to the street affords someone the opportunity to push you out into the street. Remain alert when walking across alley entrances or other places where a terrorist could be hiding. Walk only in lighted areas. Avoid bad sections of town. Avoid walking in noisy areas; e.g., a construction site. Stay near people. Don’t walk in isolated areas; e.g., alleys. Avoid hostile crowds by turning back or crossing the street. If you suspect you are being followed, move as quickly as possible to a safe- haven (e.g., police station or government office). Safeguards while Flying If possible, buy your ticket at the last possible moment to prevent unautho- rized personnel from finding out about your travel plans."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 2-27 Choose flights that will route you through an airport with a history of good security measures. Avoid countries, airports or airlines that are currently targets of terrorist orga- nizations. Direct flights are best. If possible use military air, military charter or U.S. flag carriers. Arrive early. Don’t loiter near the ticket counter, luggage check-in or security area. Go through security as quickly as possible to the boarding area. Only use shops, restaurants, and lounges in the security area, not the main terminal. Buy your ticket at a travel agency that offers you seat selection and gives you a boarding pass when you buy your ticket. Ask for a window seat near the center of the aircraft. Terrorists generally select passengers for abuse that are sitting in more easily accessible aisle seats. Don’t let your carry-on luggage out of your sight and don’t agree to “watch” someone else’s luggage. Keep your eyes open for any suspicious activity such as an individual who gets up and leaves behind bags, packages, etc. If you see something suspi- cious, get out of the area quickly and report it to airport security officials! Stay within the restricted or boarding areas of the airport, or leave the airport if possible or practical when you have a long layover for several hours. No matter where you are in the terminal, identify objects suitable for cover in the event of an attack. Pillars, trash cans, luggage, large planters, counters and furniture can provide some protection. Sit with your back against a wall, facing the crowd to give you greater aware- ness to your surroundings. Avoid seats in first class."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 2-28 Count the number of seats to the closest emergency exit so that you will be able to find your way out in case the lights go out, or if the compartment fills with smoke. Avoid telling other passengers that you are in the military or otherwise confid- ing in them. On a foreign carrier, avoid speaking English as much as possible. Inform someone of your destination and get in the habit of checking in with them before you depart and after you reach your destination. This could pro- vide authorities with a starting point if you should become missing. At the first indication of a hijacking, hide all documents, identification cards, and official passports that could identify you as military. Safeguards while Staying in Hotels Stay at DOD facilities whenever possible for security. Request another room if one has been reserved for you. Do not give your room number to strangers. Avoid street-level rooms. Ask for a room between the second and eighth floors. This puts you high enough to avoid easy access from the outside and still be low enough for local fire equipment to reach. Check before exiting from an elevator or your room for objects that seem out of place or for strangers who seem to be loitering. Answer the hotel phone with hello, not your name. Never answer hotel paging. If you are expecting someone, go to the lobby, but don’t go to the desk and identify yourself, check to see if the caller is whom you are waiting for. Keep your room key on you at all times. Don’t leave a copy of your room key on your key chain for the parking attendants."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 2-29 Be careful answering the door. First, check to see who it is through the peep hole or side window and arrange knock signals with your traveling companions. Watch for anyone loitering in halls, lobbies, or public areas or for anyone carrying objects that could be used as a weapon. Vary your arrival and departure times. Vary how you enter and exit the building; e.g., use a hotel’s entrance as well as its elevators and stairwells. Know where emergency exits and fire extinguishers are located. Avoid frequent exposure on windows and balconies. Keep your room draperies closed. Conduct business in your room, not in the lobby or hallways. Inspect your room thoroughly upon entering. Keep your room and personal effects neat and orderly. This practice helps you recognize tampering or strange, out-of-place objects. Place a piece of tape on the door crack or a string in the door jam. If it has moved while you were out, you will know that someone has entered your room during your absence. Lock the door and use the chain. Place the DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door. Avoid maid service and never admit a stranger to your room. Consider purchasing a portable door alarm, this will awaken you if someone attempts to enter while you are sleeping. Place a large screw into the space between the door and the door frame, this will delay anyone’s entry into the room."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 2-30 Detecting Surveillance Terrorist operations are normally meticulously planned, allowing for the greatest chance of success and safe escape for the terror- ists. Reducing vulnerability with security enhancements is vital to your efforts to deter terrorist attacks. Equally important is surveil- lance detection. In most cases, the target that terrorists select to attack is based on lengthy surveillance. Through surveillance, they hope to learn about your habits and assess where you are vulnerable. By practicing good individual protective measures, you not only disrupt their intelligence gathering efforts, but you also make yourself a “hard target.” Terrorists want to hit “soft” targets, which minimizes their risk of failure. In cases of targets of opportunity, however, the surveillance may last only for a few minutes to hours to confirm the ease of the target. However, ter- rorists will usually abandon “hard targets” and move on to another “soft target.” Leave the lights, television or radio on when you are out of the room to give the appearance that someone is still there. Find out if the hotel has security guards; if so, determine how many, their hours of duty, equipment they use, their expertise, and how to locate them by phone and in person. Do not discuss travel plans over hotel phones. The lines could be “bugged.” Do not take the first taxi in line when leaving your hotel and don’t allow strangers to direct you to a specific cab."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 2-31 Upon arrival in a new area, begin determining what is normal and routine. Once you’ve determined what is normal and routine, it is easier to determine what is unusual. This makes the problem of identifying surveillance simpler. Often initial surveillance efforts are conducted by less experienced personnel who may often make mistakes. For example, terrorists will often show up at a surveillance location immediately prior to their target’s arrival and depart immediately after the target leaves. A surveillance program involving family members, neighbors, and domestic employees can often detect this surveillance. Look for people who are in the wrong place or dressed inappro- priately. Eliminate stereotypes about terrorist surveillance person- nel; they are often women and children. Be particularly observant when traveling to and from your home or office. Look up and down the streets for suspicious vehicles, motorcycles, mopeds, etc. Note people near your home or place of work who appear to be repair personnel, utility crews, or even peddlers. Ask yourself if they appear genuine or is something unusual? Types of Surveillance l Stationary - At home, along route or at work. l Following - On foot or by vehicle. l Monitoring - Telephone, mail, computers. l Searching - Luggage, personal effects, trash. l Eavesdropping - Electronic and personnel. Terrorists sometimes employ an elaborate system involving several people and vehicles. Typical surveillance vehicles are motorcycles and cars with multiple personnel.

Determine if a surveillance pattern is developing. Surveillance Indicators l Illegally parked or occupied parked vehicles. l Cars with large mirrors. l Cars that suddenly pull out of parking places or side streets when you pass, cars that move with you when you move, or cars that pass you and immediately park. l Cars slowly maneuvering through turns and intersections or vehicles signalling for turns but do not turn. l Flashing lights for signaling between cars. l Unusual speeding up, slowing down or running red lights to stay up with you. Conduct a route analysis of your principal routes that you make on routine trips. Identify chokepoints where your vehicle must slow down. Typically these chokepoints are: traffic circles, one- way streets, bridges, and major intersections. Search out safe- havens that you can pull into along the route in the event of emer- gency. If you think you’re being followed, go directly to a safehaven, not your home. Safehavens are generally well lit, pub- lic facilities where persons will respond to your request for help. (Examples of a safehaven might be a police station, fire station, large shopping mall, busy restaurant.) If you are aware of surveillance, never let those watching you know you have figured out what they are doing. Never confront them. Terrorists and criminal elements are typically armed, don’t want to be identified, and may react violently in a confrontation."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 2-33 Reaction (if in a Vehicle) l Circle the block for confirmation of surveillance. l Do not stop or take other actions that could lead to confrontation l If possible, get a description of the car and its occupants. l Go to the nearest safehaven. Report incident to the nearest security or law enforcement organization. Reaction (if on Foot) l Move rapidly towards a safehaven avoiding any route you routinely use. l If a safehaven is not immediately available, move into a crowded area. l Immediately report suspicions to nearest security element or local law enforcement. Attack Recognition If terrorists succeed in surveilling you and plan an attack, the next place to foil their efforts is to recognize their intentions and pre- pare to escape. Recognizing an attack scenario is difficult. Often what may appear to be an attack is more likely to be innocent cir- cumstances. However, alertness and willingness to act are the keys to surviving a genuine attack scenario. Abnormal Situations l Individuals who appear to be excessively nervous and seem out of place by dress or mannerisms. l Individuals wearing unusually long or heavy clothing for the environment."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 2-34 l Individuals who appear to be acting as lookouts along your route of travel. l Vehicles that hit your car from the front or rear. l Unusual detours, vehicle roadblocks, cones, or other barri- ers. Be prepared to escape by going around the obstacle or ramming it. l Vehicles traveling with items protruding from side doors or vans traveling with side doors open. l Disabled vehicles, hitchhikers or distressed “accident victims” seeking your assistance are commonly employed traps. l A flagman, workman or fake police or government checkpoint stopping your car at a suspicious place. l Sudden unusual activity or the unexplained absence of local civilians. l Gunfire. Escape, Evade or Confront Once you recognize an attack is occurring, decisions must be made immediately. If the scenario is an armed attack or assassina- tion attempt, get out of the kill zone. Typically terrorists have a relatively narrow window of time and may have restricted fields of fire due to obstacles in their path. Once you exit the kill zone, terrorists will rarely pursue you since they must begin their own escape and evasion plan. In emergency situations, it may be a matter of survival to employ evasive driving techniques in order to arrive at the nearest safehaven. Use of evasive driving tech- niques may also be to you advantage by attracting the attention of local law enforcement. If on foot, take advantage of the density of crowds and layouts of buildings to evade pursuers. When you feel"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 2-35 you have evaded the terrorists and are out of immediate danger, contact security forces or law enforcement for assistance. In some cases, you may become captive as were the passengers on board the ill-fated flights of 11 September 2001. Escape and evasion were not possible. The only chance for those passengers to survive was to confront the terrorists in order to regain control of the aircraft. On one aircraft, although the plane crashed killing all on board, the passengers’ confrontation with the terrorists saved countless lives because the aircraft never reached its intended target. Incident Reaction Bombs Should a bomb explode outside the building, do not rush to the window to see what happened. Immediately seek cover in a pro- tected area due to the possibility of a secondary, probably larger explosion (referred to as a double bombing). Terrorists may use an initial bomb to breach outer security, then a second bomb on the target, and may follow-up the bombing with an armed attack. In a variation, terrorists can place an initial bomb, followed by a second bomb shortly thereafter to kill or injure security forces and emergency services responding to the initial bomb. In the city, if you are on the street when a terrorist bomb explo- sion occurs, quickly get inside the nearest building and remain"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 2-36 there. Shattered glass and other debris from high-rise buildings can fall for blocks around the point of explosion. As soon as prac- tical, following a bombing: l Notify the proper authorities. l Evacuate the wounded based on the situation. Do not impede the efforts of emergency services. Witnesses to the bombing will naturally approach the explosion area to aid in searching for casualties. Authorities will also be trying to coordinate the search and will want to limit the number of searchers due to the threat of additional explosions and secondary effects such as falling masonry or fires. l Move to a clear area, away from objects such as automobiles, buildings, and garbage containers. Armed Attack or Assassination If in an office or hotel, quickly lock the door, turn out the lights, grab the telephone, and get down on the floor. Call building secu- rity immediately. Telephone connections outside the building or hotel might be difficult to obtain. If no security office is available, call the local authorities. Tell the authorities exactly what you heard and provide them with the address, building, floor, room number, and telephone number. Stay in a protected area, and if possible, take the phone with you. If you believe you are involved in a terrorist takeover, hide your wallet and identification. Arsons and Firebombings Exercise normal fire safety precautions.

It will remain an effective terrorist tool as long as mankind values human life. Hope- fully, you will never become a hostage, but if you do, knowing how to react will improve your chances of survival. Your role as a hos- tage is to survive with honor —not to kill the terrorists or get you or your fellow hostages killed. Remember, most hostages survive a hostage-taking. Terrorists select hostages for a variety of reasons. The hostage may have a prominent job or social status or may be— l Well known, so that terrorists receive widespread media attention. l An American. l Hated by the terrorists, or the terrorists may blame the hostage for any setbacks they have suffered from their own govern- ment’s forces. For example, U.S. military advisors in El Salva- dor were despised by terrorists of the FMLN because of the assistance the advisors provided the El Salvadorian government. l Valuable to employers and families; for example, families and civilian firms have paid ransoms to secure a hostage’s release. l Seen as a threat to the terrorists. For example, in Colombia, the terrorist groups M-19 and Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), who make more than $100 million each year from cocaine sales, target special agents of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 3-2 These reasons identify why a particular person may be targeted for a hostage-taking. But, in most cases, a hostage is an innocent vic- tim of circumstances—someone who was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Therefore, you must prepare yourself to respond (both mentally and physically) to a hostage-taking incident. The Hostage-Takers The following paragraphs address broad categories of hostage- takers—the ones that are the norm. The lines between the catego- ries may blur or overlap, and the hostage-taker may move from one category to another based on a goal. Multiple subsets may also exist within each category. Terrorist Suicide Missions If under the control of terrorists, you must rapidly determine the terrorists’ intent: to establish a bargaining position and elicit publicity or to carry out a suicide mission. The passen- gers on board the planes used in the 11 September 2001 attacks were not hostages in the traditional sense because the terrorists never intended to use them to achieve a bar- gaining position. Those passengers were simply on board a skyjacked aircraft that was being used for a suicide mission. In such terrorist suicide mission situations, the techniques described in the “Escape or Surrender” section on page 3-8 may be the most useful."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 3-3 Political Extremist Most hostage-takers are political extremists. They typically oper- ate within a military-type structure. Their operations are usually well planned. They typically resist appeals based on morals, decency or fear for their own safety. They are often prepared to die for their cause. Statistically, leaders of political extremist groups are single, urban, bright, and dedicated to their cause. They are often col- lege graduates with professional backgrounds. They often come from upper or upper middle class families whose parents are politically active but not violent. They tend to be abnormally idealistic and inflexible. Fleeing Criminal Fleeing criminals take hostages on impulse, typically to avoid immediate apprehension and to have a bargaining chip for escape. Authorities must handle a fleeing criminal with caution. If he feels a sudden loss of power, it can create agitation, despair, or panic. With these emotions at the forefront, he also may impul- sively kill a hostage. Therefore, time and patience in dealing with the hostage-taker is critical. The fleeing criminal will often settle for much less than originally demanded if he perceives that he is slowly losing power, control of the situation, or facing death. Many times, he will surrender if allowed to give up with dignity. Wronged Person A hostage-taker who feels he is a wronged person is motivated by personal revenge. He seeks to notify society of the defects in the system or the establishment. He attempts to effect justice in order"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 3-4 to right a wrong or to publicize what he feels is an injustice. The hostage may represent the “system” to the hostage-taker; if so, the hostage could be in increased danger. This type of hostage- taker is convinced that he is absolutely right in his behavior. Often, gentle persuasion is required to convince him that he needs to end the situation and release the hostage. Religious Extremist Dealing with hostage-takers who are religious extremists requires time, patience, and sensitivity. Religious extremists share a com- mon, unshakable belief in the righteousness of their cause. They may perceive that their source of power comes from their god or the leaders of their cult or group. They may see themselves as supe- rior to others simply because of their beliefs. Individuals who join cults or radical religious groups often lack personal confidence and join these types of organizations to bolster their self-esteem. Religious extremists may feel that they must succeed or die for their faith. Some religious cults and groups believe that to die at the hand of the nonbeliever is the holiest achievement possible. This way of thinking greatly increases the threat to the hostage. The hostage may also be seen as a “sacrificial lamb,” one who must die for the sins of others. Mentally Disturbed A hostage-taker who is mentally disturbed is not normally associ- ated with an organized terrorist group. However, this type of hos- tage-taker conducts over half of the hostage-taking incidents. Usually, the mentally disturbed hostage-taker acts alone. Authori- ties may have difficulty establishing and maintaining a rapport with the mentally disturbed hostage-taker. If challenged or threatened by"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 3-5 authorities, the mentally disturbed hostage-taker may easily accept the murder of a hostage, his own personal suicide or both. Personal Contingency Planning As a Marine and a representative of the U.S. Armed Forces, you are a potential hostage even in low and negligible threat areas. You must prepare for your own personal safety, prepare your family, and prepare for the potential of becoming a hostage and the ensuing captivity. Although nothing can fully prepare you for the experience of becoming a hostage, knowing that the following issues have been addressed will lessen the trauma on you and your family: l Your will is current and your family knows its location. l Appropriate powers of attorney are given to a spouse, relation, or trusted friend. l Your family knows who to contact for assistance. l Family finances are settled so they do not suffer financially dur- ing your captivity. Family members should have access to money, airline tickets, credit cards, insurance policies, etc. All family members should assemble a personal history/informa- tion sheet, preferably in their own handwriting, which can be used as an aid to law enforcement and intelligence officials in the event of an incident. This sheet should contain the following information items: l Name and nicknames. l Place and date of birth."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 3-6 l Home address and telephone number. l Secondary address and telephone number l Precise physical description (e.g., height, weight, scars, tat- toos, dentures, etc.). l Other identifying characteristics (e.g., birthmarks, physical handicaps). l Prescription for eyeglasses used. l Special medications and instructions for their use. l Vehicles (types and license). l School (type, class, address, teachers). l Recent information on educational qualifications and hobbies. l Information about friends residing in diverse locations and their phone numbers. l Preparing a brief family member oral history on a cassette recording may be helpful. This can be used to help identify voices on recordings mailed to authorities in the event of a kidnapping. Samples of handwriting taken under various conditions (e.g., writing on the hood of a car, writing on bare ground), may also be helpful. Your family also needs to know how to react if you are taken hos- tage. Typically, terrorists carry radios so they can listen to the news and monitor the world’s reaction to the hostage-taking and to receive further instructions from their superiors. Your family should not grant interviews to the media. If confronted by the media for a statement, your family should say that they hope the terrorists will release the hostages, and that the ordeal will be over soon. You should advise your family not to express fear for your safety, identify you as a Marine, or provide the terrorists"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 3-7 with any information that will help the terrorists select you as a victim or endanger the lives of the other hostages. Department of Defense Directive 1300.7 Closely related to personal contingency planning is developing a good understanding of the policy and guidance contained in DOD Directive (DOD Dir) 1300.7, Training and Education Measures Necessary to Support the Code of Conduct . The six articles of the Code of Conduct outline basic responsibilities and moral obliga- tions of members of the U.S Armed Forces. The code is designed to assist military personnel, both in combat and those being held as prisoners of war, conduct themselves in a manner that brings credit upon themselves and their country. When military personnel participate in military operations other than war or are assigned overseas, they are potentially subject to detention by hostile governments or captivity by terrorist groups. DOD Directive 1300.7 builds upon the spirit and intent of the Code of Conduct to provide guidance to servicemembers that specifically applies to peacetime detention or captivity. Key ele- ments of the directive include the following: l Maintaining faith with fellow hostages by communication and rejecting privileges and special favors. l Resisting exploitation for information or propaganda purposes. l Maintaining proper bearing and displaying courtesy. l Resisting disclosure of classified information or materials. l Organizing in a military manner to the fullest extent possible. l Avoiding embarrassment to the U.S. and host governments."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 3-8 l Authorizing acceptance of release unless doing so requires you to compromise your honor or causes damage to the U.S. gov- ernment or allies. l Authorizing escape attempts, if you view such as attempt as your only hope. l Providing specific guidance and legal considerations involv- ing detention by hostile governments. Escape or Surrender During the initial moment of capture, you must make an instant decision—escape or surrender. Even though it is the most danger- ous time of a hostage ordeal, you must remain calm. Do not make any sudden movement that may rattle an already anxious gun- man. Abductors are tense; adrenaline is flowing. Terrorists them- selves feel vulnerable until they are convinced they have established firm control over their hostages. Unintentional vio- lence can be committed with the slightest provocation. For exam- ple, do not make eye contact with the captors initially. Be polite and cooperate. You may need to reassure your abductors that you are not trying to escape by controlling your emotions, following instructions, and avoiding physical resistance. Terrorists meticulously plan to capture hostages. Initiative, time, location, and circumstances of the capture usually favor the cap- tors, not hostages. However, the best opportunity to escape is nor- mally during the confusion of the takeover while you are still in a relatively public place. During this period the hostage takers are focused on establishing control and may leave openings for escape. If you decide in advance to try to escape, try to plan and practice doing so. Mental alertness improves the chances of"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 3-9 escape. While waiting for an opportunity to escape, continue pas- sive information collection on— l Appearance, accents, rank structure, equipment, and routines of the terrorists. l Strengths and weaknesses of the facility and its personnel. l Conditions and surrounding area that could impact an escape attempt. l Items within the detention area that can be used to support an escape effort. Escape from detention by terrorists is risky but may become necessary if conditions deteriorate to the point that the risks associated with escape are less than the risks of remaining cap- tive. These risks would include the credible threat of torture and death at the hands of the terrorists. Escape attempts should be made only after careful consideration of the risk of violence, chance of success, and possible detrimental effects on hostages remaining behind. If you eliminate escape as an option, avoid physical resistance. Assure your captors of your intention to cooperate fully. Intimidation and Control Remember, hostage-takers usually want you alive! They may use drugs, blindfolds, or gags when they abduct you, but try not to be alarmed or resist unduly. If you struggle, hostage-takers may resort to more severe measures of restraint. Hostage-takers use blindfolds or hoods to keep you from knowing where you are being taken, as well as to prevent you from identifying them later. You should not"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 3-10 attempt to remove a blindfold or hood, if you see your abductors they may kill you. Likewise, you should not attempt to remove an abductor’s mask or hood if they are wearing one. Hostage-takers may also drug their victims, usually at the begin- ning of an operation, to make the victim sleep and keep him paci- fied. This experience should not be alarming. At this stage, your life is almost as important to the hostage-taker as it is to you. Drugs used to put you to sleep do not have lasting side effects. If hostage-takers should use drugs such as heroin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), or sleeping pills, you can typically recover from this quicker than you can from physical abuse. Hostage-tak- ers may use “truth-serum” drugs, but these drugs are typically inefficient, and their results are similar to the consumption of too much alcohol. Stabilization If you are abducted, your goal is to survive. To survive, you must adjust. You must try to maintain emotional control as quickly as possible after the capture. Maintaining emotional control helps you keep control of your mental abilities such as situational awareness, judgment, and descisionmaking skills. Remember, most hostages survive an abduction. After the initial shock of capture wears off, both hostage takers and victims stabilize their emotions and begin to plan for the future. The terrorists may divulge information about themselves, their organization, their goals, and objectives. They may share their demands and may even discuss roles and responsibilities that the hostages have. The hostages begin making an emotional transition from being a vic- tim to being a survivor. But to survive, you must be alert and cau- tious. Remember that hostage-takers have used “sleepers” in their"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 3-11 hostage operations. A sleeper is really a terrorist posing as a hos- tage to inform on the real hostages or draw out security person- nel. Be careful who you trust. Situational Awareness If you are blindfolded and gagged during transportation, concen- trate on sounds, smells, direction of movement, passage of time, conversations of the hostage-takers, and any information t hat might be useful. For example, you might hear train sounds that might indicate you are near a train station or going by rail road tracks. Hearing a ship’s horn would indicate you are crossing a river or near a body of water. Try and draw a mental map of where you are. If you can hear the hostage-takers, try to determine the language they are speaking, key phrases, goals of the abduction, names, weapons carried, and directions taken, such as “make a left at [famous landmark].” Information collected over time might allow you to guess the possible route and the area where they have taken you. All this information will be very useful if you are released or if you escape while the hostage-takers are still holding other hos tages. Confrontations To avoid confrontations with any hostage-taker, you should not carry documents or other sensitive or potentially embarrassing items in your briefcase or on your person. If taken hostage, you must be prepared to explain telephone numbers, addresses, names, and any other items carried at the time of capture. If asked for iden- tification, show your tourist passport. Dispose of items such as your military ID and official passport as soon as possible. If you are identified as member of the military, you could be perceived as a"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 3-12 threat to the hostage-taker’s activities. If interrogated, adopt a sim- ple, tenable position and stick with it. Delay identifying yourself as military, but do not lie when asked if you are in the military. Rather, you should attempt to skirt the question; i.e., if you are a formal school instructor, reply “I am a teacher.” You should try to con- vince your captors that they have kidnapped the wrong person. The terrorists may not be convinced, but don't give up. This delaying effort serves only to maximize survival during the initial stages of captivity and reduce the terrorist’s apprehension that you might be a threat to their activities. Most casualties among hostages occur during the process of capture and initial internment. Defense Mechanisms As a Marine, it is important to understand what is going on in the minds of hostages. You might observe what you would consider unusual behavior. This behavior is usually a combination of psy- chological effects that terrorists seek to achieve by their control- ling actions and unconscious, personality-based responses hostages display while in captivity. Survival is instinctively the most important issue to the human mind. When placed in a hostage situation, the mind commonly employs defense mechanisms. These unconscious psychological adjustments are made by hostages to deal with the stress and trauma of the situation. To survive this ordeal, the mind can typi- cally deny that the incident is occurring; regress into a dependent state; and/or identify with the hostage-taker’s demands and val- ues to avoid punishment. A combination of these defense mecha- nisms can result in the “Stockholm Syndrome,” whereby the hostage identifies with the hostage-taker and may actively sup- port the hostage-taker’s activities."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 3-13 Denial Denial is a primitive and very common defense mechanism. To survive an incident that the mind cannot handle, it reacts as if the incident is not happening. Hostages commonly respond, “This can’t be happening to me!” or “This must be a bad dream!” Denial is one stage of coping with an impossible turn of events. These thoughts are actually stress-relieving techniques. Some hostages deny their situation by sleeping. As time passes, most hostages gradually accept their situation. They find hope in the thought that their fate is not fixed, begin to view the situation as temporary, and believe they will be res- cued soon. Regression Regression is the return to a more elementary thought pattern commonly found in children. Like a child, a hostage is in a state of extreme dependence and subject to fright. Unconsciously, the hos- tage selects a behavior that was successfully used in childhood. The hostage becomes reliant on the hostage-taker just as if the hostage-taker was a parent, providing food, shelter, and protection from the outside world. If this thought pattern is firmly in place, hostages may view authorities as a threat to the “safety” being pro- vided by the hostage-takers. Identification Like regression, identifying with the hostage-taker occurs at the unconscious level. The mind seeks to avoid wrath or punishment by mirroring the behaviors and complying with the demands of the hostage-taker."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 3-14 The Stockholm Syndrome Because you are a potential hostage, you must know and understand the Stockholm Syndrome (see page 3-15). If taken hostage, you will be able to recognize if it is happening to other hostages. The Stockholm Syndrome is an automatic, unconscious emotional response to the trauma of becoming a victim. Observed around the world, the Stockholm Syndrome occurs when people are exposed to a high level of stress and cast together with others, not of their choosing, into a new level of adaptation. The result is a positive bond that affects both the hostage and the hostage-taker. The positive emo- tional bond may develop because of the stress of being in a closed room under siege. This bond unites its victims against the outside world. An attitude of “it’s us against them” seems to develop. The Stockholm Syndrome produces a variety of responses. Minimal responses consist of victims seeing the event through the eyes of their captor. Those deeply influenced respond by recognizing the terrorist for his “gallant act.” Responses have also ranged from hostage apathy to actual participation by the hostages in impeding the efforts of rescue forces and negotia- tion teams. Another response is losing touch with reality and suffering long-term emotional instability."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 3-15 No one knows how long the syndrome lasts, but the bond seems to be beyond the control of some hostages. They all share com- mon experiences, including positive contact, sympathy for the human qualities of the hostage-takers, and tolerance. On 23 August 1973, the quiet, early morning routine of the Credit Bank in Stockholm, Sweden, was destroyed by the sound of a submachine gun. Four hostages were held for 131 hours: three women ranging in ages from 21 to 31 and a 25-year old man. They were held by Jan-Erik Olsson, a thief, burglar, and prison escapee. Olsson kept the hostages in an 11-foot by 4-foot crated bank vault, which they came to share with another criminal and former cell mate of Olsson’s, Clark Olofsson. Olofsson joined the group after Olsson demanded his release from prison, and the authorities granted his request. Over time, the hostages began to fear the police more than they feared the robbers. In a phone call to Premier Olof Palme, one of the hostages told the Premier that the robbers were protecting them from the police. After the hos- tages were released, they began to question why they didn’t hate the robbers, why they felt as if Olsson and Olofsson had been the ones to give them their lives back, and that they were emotionally indebted to them for this generosity. For weeks after the incident and while under the care of psychia- trists, some of the hostages experienced severe conflicting emotions of fear that Olsson and Olofsson might escape from jail, yet they also felt no hatred for them. This hostage- taking and its resulting conflicting psychological emotions became knows as the Stockholm Syndrome."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 3-16 Positive Contact Hostages may develop positive contact with their abductors if they do not have negative experiences (for example, beatings and rapes). Positive contact also develops if there has been a negative experience followed by a positive contact. For example, if a hos- tage was beaten by a “cruel guard” every time the hostage asked for a drink of water, then a “kind guard” replaced the “cruel guard” who gives water freely, typically, the hostage will estab- lish a positive contact with the “kind guard.” Human Qualities of the Hostage-Takers Hostage-takers may talk about their own mental abuse and physi- cal suffering. They want their hostages to see them as victims of circumstance rather than aggressors. Unfortunately, hostages may sympathize with the hostage-taker and forget that he is the one depriving them of their freedom. Once hostages begin to sympa- thize with the hostage-taker, they may actually support the hos- tage-takers’ cause. Tolerance Humans have an unconscious limit as to how much we will allow ourselves to be abused or how much we can tolerate. When we are placed in a survival situation, our acceptable tolerance for abuse usually increases in order for us to survive. Coping with Captivity Coping is a rational mental process used by hostages to deal with and adjust to the problems of a difficult environment. Unlike"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 3-17 defense mechanisms that are mostly unconscious reactions based on personality, coping involves conscious and deliberate thoughts and actions. Coping includes such innovative behaviors as adjust- ing to living conditions, maintaining dignity and respect, dealing with fear, maintaining mental and physical fitness, and building rapport with captors. Living Conditions The living conditions hostages have endured vary from incident to incident. Hostages have been held for days in a bus, airliner or train where heat or lack of heat and lack of adequate water, food, and toi- let facilities were almost unbearable. During the seizure of an office or residence, hostages may be in familiar, comfortable sur- rounding where they have worked or lived. But kidnap victims are frequently forced to live in makeshift prisons located in attics, basements or remote hideouts. These prisons may be quite small and in some cases prevent the hostage from easily standing or mov- ing around. Sleeping and toilet facilities may be poor, consisting of a cot or mattress and a bucket or tin can for body waste, or a hos- tage may be forced to soil his living space as well as himself. The hostage-takers may move you to different holding areas to keep you hidden from authorities. To assist authorities in locating you, you should leave your fingerprints wherever possible in your living area. Dignity and Self-Respect Maintaining one’s dignity and self-respect can be very difficult, but it is vital to your survival. Your dignity and self-respect may be the keys to retaining your status as a human being in the eyes of the hostage-takers. If you can build empathy while maintaining your"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 3-18 dignity, you can potentially lessen the aggression of a captor. Most people cannot inflict pain on another person unless that person becomes dehumanized or turned into a symbol of their hatred. Fear Fear of death is a hostage-taker’s most important tool. They use it to control, intimidate, and wear down the hostage and the negoti- ators. The fear of death is usually greatest during the first few hours of capture. Hostage-takers may induce fear by loading and unloading weapons in the hostage’s presence, displaying excesses of temper, resorting to physical abuse, and staging mock execu- tions which are “mercifully” stopped at the last minute. As this fear subsides, a hostage may begin to hear he “owes” his life to the captors who have “allowed” him to live. Anticipate isolation and terrorist efforts to confuse you. Fear of dying is real, and it can become overwhelming, especially during the early phase of captivity. However, you must try to maintain emotional control in order to stay mentally alert. Fight despair and depression by keeping a positive mental outlook. Remember, although death is a real possibility, most hostages walk out of the ordeal. Physical and Mental Fitness If abducted, you should develop and maintain a daily physical fit- ness program. It will help you ward off boredom and can reduce stress. Staying physically fit might be the deciding factor if an escape opportunity presents itself, and you have to run or walk a considerable distance to reach safety. It may be hard to exercise because of cramped space or physical restraints, but you can run in place or perform isometric exercises. However, you should avoid excessive exercise that could result in injury."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 3-19 It is important to make some mental link to the outside world. To stimulate your mind, you can read, write, daydream, or use your imagination to build something step-by-step (a house, a car, a piece of furniture, etc.). Ask the hostage-takers for reading mate- rials or a radio. If possible, communicate with and try to reassure fellow hostages. If it is your day of worship, mentally walk through the various parts of the worship service. Establish a slow, methodical routine for every task. Typically, hostage-takers want to keep their hostages alive and well. Eat whatever food is available to maintain your strength. If you need medicine, ask for exactly what you need. If your abduc- tors want you alive, they are not likely to take chances by provid- ing you with the wrong medicine. A side effect of capt ivity for some hostages is weight loss. Although this may be considerable, it generally does not cause health problems. Hostages may also suffer gastrointestinal upset including nau sea, vomiting, diar- rhea, and/or constipation. Although these symptoms can be debilitating, they are usually not life-threat ening. Establishing Rapport Rapport-building techniques help you make a transition from a faceless symbol who has been dehumanized to one who is human again. However, don’t exaggerate your human emotions by beg- ging or crying. An emotional outburst could spread panic and fear among the other hostages and could be viewed as a disgusting dis- play of cowardice by the hostage-takers. You must portray your- self as a person rather than an object by maintaining your dignity, self-respect, and apparent sincerity. You must attempt to establish"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 3-20 rapport with your hostage-taker, but you must do it with dignity and self-respect. This rapport may save your life. You should— l Make eye contact with the hostage-takers. l Greet the hostage-takers and use personal names. l Smile. l Talk to the hostage-takers. Especially talk about your family and show photos if you have them. l Determine if you have common interests; e.g., sports, hygiene, food, etc. l Listen to the hostage-taker. If he wants to talk about his cause, act interested. You may explain that you might not agree with him, but you’re interested in his point view. l Avoid appearing overly attentive or interested, the hostage- takers may view this as patronizing or insincere. l Avoid arguing with the hostage-takers. Avoid escalating ten- sions with words such as gun, kill, or punish that could cause the hostage-takers to single you out as being argumentative or combative and therefore a threat to the their authority. Bring up neutral topics at critical times to defuse arguments and reduce tensions. l Avoid emotionally charged topics of religion, economics, and politics. l Do not refuse favors offered by your captors if doing so will aggravate them or cause further harm to the health and safety of all hostages. However, do not accept favorable treatment at the expense of other hostages. Terrorists commonly employ this controlling tactic to cause division and distrust among the hostage group."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 3-21 Exploitation of Hostages Hostages should make reasonable efforts to avoid providing oral or signed confessions, answering questionnaires, making propa- ganda broadcasts, and conducting news interviews. These actions help terrorist groups further their goals and exploit the media. Interviews broadcast around the world could embarrass the U.S. or host governments. However, if you don’t comply with the hos- tage-takers requests, you could be tortured or threatened with death. You should never mistake pride for inappropriate resis- tance. Keep your temper under control and maintain a polite bear- ing. When being interrogated, take a simple, tenable position and stick with it. Give short answers to the terrorist questions that dis- cuss unimportant topics. The Department of Defense policy is survive with honor . If you are forced to sign or make a statement for the hostage-takers, try to degrade the propaganda, provide minimum information, and avoid making a plea on your behalf. Identify your statement as being made in response to the demands of your captors. Do not hide your face if the hostage-takers take photographs of the hostages; photos provide authorities with pos- itive identification and information. Releases and Rescue Attempts Historically, the more time that passes, the better chance a hos- tage has of being released or rescued. The majority of hostage- taking incidents are resolved by negotiated releases not rescue attempts. While the passage of time without rescue or release can be depressing, it is actually to your advantage. Time can produce a positive or negative bond between you and your abductors. If the hostage-taker does not abuse you, hours spent together will"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 3-22 most likely build rapport, produce positive results, and increase your chances of survival. However, you must also look ahead and plan for your release or rescue. You must also remember that if the hostage-takers’ demands are not met, they may kill hostages. You must prepare yourself for the potential response from author- ities if a hostage is killed. Typically, negotiations cease, and res- cue forces move in to rescue hostages. Releases The moment of imminent release, like the moment of capture, is very dangerous. The hostage-takers, as well as the hostages, are likely to feel threatened and even panic. The hostage-takers will be extremely nervous during any release phase, especially if negotiations are drawn out. The terrorists will be anxious to evade capture and punishment, and they will fear being double- crossed by the authorities. You need to pay close attention to the instructions the hostage-takers give you when the release takes place: do not panic and do not run because the hostage-takers may shoot you. Rescue Attempts During the rescue attempt, both the hostage and the rescue force are in extreme danger. Most hostages who die are killed during rescue attempts. You must be especially alert, cautious, and obe- dient to instructions if an attempt is imminent or is occurring. If possible, position yourself in the safest area, such as under desks, behind chairs, or behind any large object that provides protection. You should avoid being near doors, windows, or open areas. If the doors fly open followed by rescue forces, drop to the floor immediately, lie as flat as possible, do not move, do not say any- thing, do not attempt to pick up a weapon or help the rescuers."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 3-23 Rescue forces have no idea whether you are friend or foe. Any movement you make could result in injury or death to you or your fellow hostages. It could also distract members of the rescue force, which, in turn, could lead to injuries or deaths among the rescuers. During a rescue operation at Entebbe, Uganda, a woman hostage threw her hands up in a natural gesture of joy as the res- cue forces came bursting in. Unfortunately, the rescue forces shot her. Once the rescue forces are in control, you might be handled roughly and ordered up against the wall. You will probably be handcuffed, searched, and possibly gagged and/or blindfolded until everyone is positively identified. After the Release Once you are safely in the hands of the authorities, remember to cooperate fully with them, especially if others are still being held. As soon as you can, write down everything you can remember: guard location, weapons and explosives description and place- ment, and any other information that might help rescue forces. After your release, you must prepare yourself for the aftermath. The news media will want an interview immediately, and you will be in no condition to provide intelligent, accurate responses. Do not make comments to the news media until you have been debriefed by proper U.S. authorities and have been cleared to do so by the appropriate military commanders. You should only say that you are grateful to be alive and thankful for being released. You should not say anything that could harm fellow hostages who may still be in captivity. You must not say anything that is sympathetic to the ter- rorist cause or that might gain support for them. Upon release, many hostages feel guilty for not having conducted themselves in a heroic manner. Emotional turmoil is common."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E 3-24 Some may feel angry because they feel that their government did not do enough to protect them. Remember that a government’s unwillingness to make concessions to terrorists discourages future acts of terrorism and sends a message to all terrorists worldwide. When ransoms for captives of terrorists have been paid by govern- ments, these payments have usually been used by terrorists to increase their status and capability to continue terrorist acts. It did not mean that your life had no value. It is the policy of the United States that when Americans are abducted overseas, the United States will continue to cultivate international cooperation to combat terrorism and secure the safe release of the hostages."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Appendix A Vehicle Bomb Search Prevention You must learn to recognize danger signs and how to search a vehi- cle for tampering or explosive devices.

If you notice that you are being observed while conducting the search, gently close the hood, trunk, or door if it is open and walk away from the vehicle. If you find a bomb, or something that looks like a bomb, DO NOT TOUCH IT: immediately contact an explosive ordnance disposal unit. An exterior search is conducted as follows: l Search the area around the vehicle.

Even better news is that survival rates are high. But should it hap- pen, remember, your personal conduct can influence treatment in captivity. The Department of State has responsibility for all U.S. government personnel and their dependents in overseas areas. Should a hostage situation develop, the Department of State will immediately begin to take action according to pre- conceived plans to attempt to release the hostages. If kid- napped and taken hostage, the hostage has three very important rules to follow: 1. Analyze the problem so as not to aggravate the situation. 2. Make decisions to keep the situation from worsening. 3. Maintain discipline to remain on the best terms with the captors. Preparing the Family l Have your family affairs in order, including an up-to-date will, appropriate powers of attorney, and measures taken to ensure family financial security. l Issues such as continuing the children's education, family relo- cation, and disposition of property should be discussed with family members. l Your family should know that talking about your military affiliation to non-DOD people may place you, or them, in great danger."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E B-21 l They must be convinced the U.S. government will work to obtain your safe release. l Don’t be depressed if negotiation efforts appear to be taking a long time.

There are many different potential chemical agents that a terrorist could use as a weapon. Nonetheless, the follow- ing broad generalizations can be made: l Although food or water contamination is possible, inhalation is the most likely method of delivery. Protection of the breathing airway is the single most import factor of defense. l Many likely agents are heavier than air and will tend to stay close to the ground. This dictates an upward safety area strategy. l Generally, chemical agents tend to present an immediate noticeable effect. Medical attention should be sought immedi- ately, even if exposure is thought to be limited. l Most chemical agents that present an inhalation hazard will break down fairly rapidly when exposed to sun, diluted with water, or dissipated in high winds. l No matter what the agent or particular concentration, evacu- ation—preferable upwind from the area of attack—is always advisable unless you are properly equipped with appropriate breathing device and protective clothing."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E B-24 Detection A chemical attack or incident will not always be immediately apparent because many agents are orderless and colorless.

In most cases, absent a gas mask, the only sure way to protect an airway is to put distance between you and the source of the agent. While evacuating the area, cover your mouth and nose with a handkerchief, coast sleeve, or any piece of cloth to provide some moderate means of protection. Other steps are: l Stay alert. Early detection enhances survival. l Move upwind from the source of attack. l If evacuation from the immediate area is impossible, move out- doors or to an interior room on a higher floor. Remember, many agents are heavier than air and will tend to stay close to the ground. l If indoors and no escape outside is possible, close all windows and exterior doors while also shutting down the air condition- ing or heating systems to prevent circulation of air. l Cover your mouth and nose. If gas masks are not available, use a surgical mask or handkerchief. An improvised mask can be made by soaking a clean cloth in a solution of one table- spoon of baking soda in a cup of water. Not highly effective, it may provide some protection. l Cover bare arms and legs and make sure any cuts or abrasions are covered and bandaged. l If splashed with an agent, immediately wipe it off using copious amounts of warm soapy water or a diluted 10:1 bleach solution."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E B-26 l If water is not available, talcum powder or flour are also excellent means of decontamination of liquid agents.

DOD Policy Guidance on the Code of Conduct for Personnel Subject to Terrorist Activity Department of Defense DERIVED FROM DOD DIRECTIVE 1300.7 AND DOD INSTRUCTION 1300.21 A. Policy: This policy concerning the conduct of U.S. military personnel isolated from U.S. control applies at all times. U.S. military personnel finding themselves isolated from U.S. con- trol are required to do everything in their power to follow DOD policy. The DOD policy in this situation is to survive with honor. B. Scope: The Code of Conduct is a moral guide designed to assist military personnel in combat or being held prisoners of war to live up to the ideals contained in the DOD policy. This guidance shall assist U.S. military personnel who find them- selves isolated from U.S. control in peacetime, or in a situation not related specifically in the Code of Conduct. C. Rationale: U.S. military personnel, because of their wide range of activities, are subject to peacetime detention by unfriendly governments or captivity by terrorist groups. This guidance seeks to help U.S. military personnel survive these sit- uations with honor and does not constitute a means for judg- ment or replace the UCMJ as a vehicle for enforcement of proper conduct. This guidance, although not exactly the same as"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E B-28 the Code of Conduct, in some areas, applies only during peace- time. The term peacetime means that armed conflict does not exist or armed conflict does exist, but the United States is not involved directly. D. General: U.S. military personnel captured or detained by hos- tile foreign governments or terrorists are often held for purposes of exploitation of the detainees or captives, or the U.S. Government, or all of them. This exploitation can take many forms, but each form of exploitation is designed to assist the foreign government or the terrorist captors. In the past, detainees have been exploited for information and propaganda efforts, confessions to crimes never committed, all of which assisted or lent credibility to the detainers. Governments also have been exploited in such situation to make damaging statements about themselves or to force them to appear weak in relation to other governments. Ransoms for captives of ter- rorists have been paid by government and such payments have improved terrorist finances, supplies, status and operations, often prolonging the terror carried on by such groups. E. Responsibility: U.S. military personnel, whether detainees or captives, can be assured that the U.S. Government will make every good faith effort to obtain their earliest release. Faith in one's country and its way of life, faith in fellow detainees or captives, and faith in one's self are critical to surviving with honor and resisting exploitation. Resisting exploitation and hav- ing faith in these areas are the responsibility of all Americans. On the other hand, the destruction of such faith must be the assumed goal of all captors determined to maximize their gains from a detention or captive situation."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E B-29 F. Goal: Every reasonable stop must be taken by U.S. military personnel to prevent exploitation of themselves and the U.S. Government. If exploitation cannot be prevented completely, every step must be taken to limit exploitation as much as possi- ble. In a sense, detained U.S. military personnel often are cata- lysts for their own release, based upon their ability to become unattractive sources or exploitation. That is, one that resists suc- cessfully may expect detainers to lose interest in further exploi- tation attempts. Detainees or captives very often must make their own judgments as to which actions will increase their chances of returning home with honor and dignity. Without exception, the military member who can say honestly that he/ she has done his/her utmost in a detention or captive situation to resist exploitation upholds DOD policy, the founding principles of the U.S., and the highest traditions of military service. G. Military Bearing and Courtesy: Regardless of the type of detention or captivity, or harshness of treatment, U.S. military personnel will maintain their military bearing. They should make every effort to remain calm and courteous, and project personal dignity. This is particularly important during the pro- cess of capture and the early stages of internment when the cap- tor may be uncertain of his control of the captives. H. Classified Information: There are no circumstances in which a detainee or captive should voluntarily give classified information or materials to those unauthorized to receive them. To the utmost of their ability, U.S. military personnel held as detainees, captives, or hostages will protect all classified infor- mation. An unauthorized disclosure of classified information, for whatever reason, does not justify further disclosures. Detainees, captives and hostages must resist, to the utmost of"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E B-30 their ability, each and every attempt by their captor to obtain such information. I. Chain of Command: In group detention, captivity, or hostage situations military detainees, captives or hostages will organize, to the fullest extent possible, in a military manner under the senior military member present and eligible to command. The importance of such organization cannot be over emphasized. His- torically, in both peacetime and wartime, establishment of a mili- tary chain of command has been a tremendous source of strength for all captives. Every effort will be made to establish and sustain communications with other detainees, captives, or hostages. Mili- tary detainees, captives, or hostages will encourage civilians being held with them to participate in the military organization and accept the authority of the senior military member. In some circumstances, such as embassy duty, military members may be under the direction of a senior U.S. civilian official. Notwith- standing such circumstances, the senior military member still is obligated to establish, as an entity, a military organization and to ensure that the guidelines in support of the DOD policy to survive with honor are not compromised. J. Guidance for Detention by Governments: Once in the cus- tody of a hostile government, regardless of the circumstances that preceded the detention situation, detainees are subject to the laws of that government. In light of this, detainees will maintain military bearing and should avoid any aggressive, combative, or illegal behavior. The latter could complicate their situation, their legal status, and any efforts to negotiate a rapid release."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E B-31 1. As American citizens, detainees should be allowed to be placed in contact with U.S. or friendly embassy personnel. Thus, detain- ees should ask immediately and continually to see U.S. Embassy personnel or a representative of an allied or neutral government. 2. U.S. military personnel who become lost or isolated in a hostile foreign country during peacetime will not act as combatants dur- ing evasion attempts. Since a state of armed conflict does not exist, there is no protection afforded under the Geneva Conven- tion. The civil laws of that country apply. However, delays in contacting local authorities can be caused by injuries affecting the military member's mobility, disorientation, fear of captivity, or desire to see if a rescue attempt could be made. 3. Since the detainer's goals may be maximum political exploita- tion, U.S. military personnel who are detained must be extremely cautious of their captors in everything they say and do. In addi- tion to asking for a U.S. representative, detainees should provide name, rank, social security number, date of birth, and the inno- cent circumstances leading to their detention. Further discussions should be limited to and revolve around health and welfare mat- ters, conditions of their fellow detainees, and going home. 4. Historically, the detainers have attempted to engage military captives in what may be called a “battle of wits” about seemingly innocent and useless topics as well as provocative issues. To engage any detainer in such useless, if not dangerous, dialog only enables a captor to spend more time with the detainee. The detainee should consider dealings with his/her captors as a “battle of wits” [sic: wills]—the detainee’s will to restrict discussion to those items that relate to the detainee's treatment and return"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E B-32 home—against the detainer's will to discuss irrelevant, if not dan- gerous, topics. 5. As there is no reason to sign any form of document in peace- time detention, detainees will avoid signing any document or making any statement, oral or otherwise. If a detainee is forced to make a statement or sign documents, he/she must provide as little information as possible and then continue to resist to the utmost of his/her ability. If a detainee writes or signs anything, such action should be measured against how it reflects upon the U.S. and the individual as a member of the military or how it could be misused by the detainer to further the detainer's ends. 6. Detainees cannot earn their release by cooperation. Release will be gained by the military member doing his/her best to resist exploitation, thereby reducing his/her value to a detainer, and thus prompting a hostile government to negotiate seriously with the U.S. Government. 7. U.S. military detainees should not refuse to accept release unless doing so requires them to compromise their honor or cause damage to the U.S. Government or its allies. Persons in charge of detained U.S. military personnel will authorize release of any per- sonnel under almost all circumstances. 8. Escape attempts will be made only after careful consideration of the risk of violence, chance of success, and detrimental effects on detainees remaining behind. Jailbreak in most countries is a crime; thus, escape attempts would provide the detainer with fur- ther justification to prolong detention by charging additional vio- lations of its criminal or civil law and result in bodily harm or even death to the detainee."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E B-33 K. Guidance for Captivity by Terrorists: Capture by terrorists is generally the least predictable and structured form of peace- time captivity. The captor qualifies as an international criminal. The possible forms of captivity vary from spontaneous hijack- ing to a carefully planned kidnapping. In such captivities, hos- tages play a greater role in determining their own fate since the terrorists in may instances expect or receive no rewards for pro- viding good treatment or releasing victims unharmed. If U.S. military personnel are uncertain whether captors are genuine terrorists or surrogates of government, they should assume that they are terrorists. 1. If assigned in or traveling through areas of known terrorist activity, U.S. military personnel should exercise prudent antiter- rorist measures to reduce their vulnerability to capture. During the process of capture and initial internment, they should remain calm and courteous, since most casualties among hostages occur during this phase. 2. Surviving in some terrorist detentions may depend on hos- tages conveying a personal dignity and apparent sincerity to the captors. Hostages therefore may discuss nonsubstantive topics such as sports, family, and clothing to convey to the terrorist the captive's personal dignity and human qualities. They will make every effort to avoid embarrassing the United States and the host government. The purpose of this dialogue is for the hostage to become a “person” in the captor's eyes, rather than a mere symbol of their ideological hatred. Such a dialogue should strengthen the hostage's determination to survive and resist. A hostage also may listen actively to the terrorist's beliefs about his/her cause; however, they should never pander, praise, partic- ipate, or debate the terrorist's cause with him/her."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E B-34 3. U.S. military personnel held hostage by terrorists should accept release using guidance in subsection J7 above. U.S. mili- tary personnel must keep faith with their fellow hostages and conduct themselves accordingly. Hostages and kidnap victims who consider escape to be their only hope are authorized to make such attempts. Each situation will be different and the hostage must carefully weigh every aspect of a decision to attempt to escape."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"MCRP 3-02E B-35 Personal Data Law enforcement agencies need timely and accurate informa- tion to effectively work for the release of hostages.
