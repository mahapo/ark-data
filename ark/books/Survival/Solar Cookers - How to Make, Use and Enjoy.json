It is a device that allows you to cook food using the sun’s energy as fuel. Is it really possible to cook with the sun? Yes, and this booklet will show you how. It will walk you through the process of building a simple solar cooker, using the cooker, and teaching simple solar cooking concepts to others. From the beginning of time — and still for many today — daily cooking has required fire, fuel gathering and frequent attention to be sure foods cook evenly, don’t burn and don’t stick to the pot. Depending on where you live and how you cook, solar cooking can save you time, work and fuel. And it’s environmentally benign. All foods can be cooked in some type of solar cooker. This booklet covers low- to medium-temperature solar box cookers and solar panel cookers (“CooKits”) that slowly and gently cook all the foods you boil, roast or bake. Other types of solar cookers reach high temperatures capable of frying. Slow cooking is different, but the differences are nice. Slow cooking retains flavor, moisture and nutrients, and makes meats tender. Recent studies indicate that foods cooked at moderate temperatures may be healthier. When solar cooking, add approximately one hour to normal cook times. No need to watch, stir or worry about food. The cook spends just two minutes: one to put food in and one to take food out. For many of us, solar cooking has become our favorite way to cook. Solar cookers complement traditional cooking methods, which are still used at night and during inclement weather. This booklet includes solar cooking concepts, solar cooker construction plans and directions for use, recipes, student activities and examples of non-cooking uses of solar cookers including solar water pasteurization — a basic survival skill. Solar cooking can make a world of difference if we each use it on sunny days and share this information with others. SCI depends on the support of its members and donors to continue to bring this life-saving knowledge to millions of families in fuel- scarce, sun-rich parts of the world. We invite you to join us in this effort. Bon appétit!"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"SOLAR COOKERS INTERNATIONAL \u0018 WHY SOLAR COOK? Solar cookers save money and time  Sunshine is free. Solar cooking saves precious fuel for evenings, cloudy days and cold weather.  Foods cook unattended while you do other things.  Pots are easy to clean. Food doesn’t stick on the inside and there’s no soot on the outside.  A solar cooker is easy to make from a variety of materials. Solar cookers are safe, healthy and convenient  There is no fire to cause burns or blow out of control.  There is no smoke to injure eyes and cause lung problems. People allergic to smoke can now enjoy “solarcues” — barbecues without the smoke.  Most solar cookers cook at 82-121ºC (180-250ºF), ideal for retaining nutrients, moisture and flavor and not burning foods. Wood and gas fire temperatures, by contrast, exceed 260ºC (500ºF).  You can bake, boil and lightly fry foods in their own juices. Meats get very tender.  Solar water pasteurization is a skill everyone should know for emergencies.  When solar cooking, your kitchen stays cool on hot, sunny days.  A CooKit folds for easy storage or carrying for meals away from home. Solar cookers are versatile and adaptable  The simple technology is easily adapted to a wide variety of construction materials, cooking customs and climates. Solar cookers are life-saving devices for those in sunny, fuel-scarce regions  Solar cookers help two of the world’s pressing problems — growing shortages of cooking fuels and the scourge of waterborne diseases. Half the world’s population cooks over wood fires. According to the United Nations, about one-third of us — two billion people — now suffer fuel wood shortages. Women, and sometimes children, must carry fuel further distances, and spend more time doing so, than in the past. Some urban families spend 30-50% of their income on"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"\u0018 SOLAR COOKERS How to make, use and enjoy cooking fuel or must barter away food for fuel to cook the remainder. Families drop the nutritious foods that require lengthy cooking — such as legumes — from their diet, contributing to malnutrition. Many governments import and subsidize fossil fuels. With solar cookers families often reduce fuel wood needs by half.  Pasteurizing water and milk in solar cookers can help reduce Cholera and other waterborne diseases, which kill 50,000 people every day. The World Health Organization estimates 80% of all illnesses are spread through contaminated water. Solar cookers save trees and soil In deforested areas, efforts to protect scarce trees fail when people have no alternatives to wood-fueled cooking. As a government administrator in Zimbabwe said, “When trees are gone, then follows erosion of the soil. ... The farmer is unable to use the land. ... The soil is washed into the river. Water needed for irrigation is no longer there. Then cotton and wheat are more expensive. ... This is a circle without end.”  Each solar cooker in sunny, arid climates can save one ton of wood per year. Solar cookers help air quality  Burning traditional fuels such as wood and gas pollutes the air and contributes to global warming. Solar cookers provide a pollution-free alternative. A checklist  Do you have mostly-sunny days several months of the year? (Essential)  Do you have a space outside that is sunny for several hours, sheltered from high wind and safe from theft or tampering?  Are your cooking fuels expensive or scarce?  Does your kitchen sometimes get too hot or your barbecue too smoky?  Do you worry about safety of small children near your kitchen stove or open cooking fire?  Do you want to prepare for emergencies or camping when you may not have safe drinking water?  Would you like carefree, absentee cooking? If you checked several boxes, you’ll probably like solar cooking! IS SOLAR COOKING FOR YOU?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"SECTION 2 SOLAR COOKER CONCEPTS"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"\u0018 SOLAR COOKERS How to make, use and enjoy There are many types of solar cookers — heat-trap boxes, curved concentrators and combinations of both. Box cookers Box cookers are the most widely used in households. There are several hundred thousand in India alone. TYPES OF SOLAR COOKERS Curved concentrator cookers Curved concentrators (often called parabolic cookers) cook fast at very high temperatures like fire, but require more frequent adjustment and supervision for safe operation. They are not covered in this booklet, but several hundred thousand households in western China use them. They are especially useful for large-scale institutional cooking. Combination cookers Combination cookers (often called panel cookers) incorporate elements of box and curved concentrator cookers. SCI’s simple “CooKit” is the most widely used combination cooker. Compared to curved concentrator cookers: • it doesn’t need to be moved to track the sun during several hours of unattended cooking • temperatures are more even • the flat shiny surfaces are safer for your eyes Compared to a box cooker: • it requires no window or insulation • it cooks just one pot at a time, but several units cost less than one box cooker Compared to both: • it is easier and cheaper to produce • it folds compactly to carry and store • it requires 10-20 clear, heat-resistant plastic cooking bags per year"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"SOLAR COOKERS INTERNATIONAL \u0018 Fuel: sunlight Sunlight is the fuel. A solar cooker needs an outdoor spot that is sunny for several hours and protected from strong wind, and where food will be safe. Solar cookers don’t work at night or on cloudy days. Convert sunlight to heat energy Dark surfaces get very hot in sunlight, whereas light surfaces don’t. Food cooks best in dark, shallow, thin metal pots with dark, tight-fitting lids to hold in heat and moisture. Retain heat A transparent heat trap around the dark pot lets in sunlight, but keeps in the heat. This is a clear, heat-resistant plastic bag or large inverted glass bowl (panel cookers) or an insulated box with a glass or plastic window (box cookers). Capture extra sunlight One or more shiny surfaces reflect extra sunlight onto the pot, increasing its heat potential. HOW SOLAR COOKERS WORK"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"\u0018 SOLAR COOKERS How to make, use and enjoy FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS What can I cook? Use your solar cooker to cook vegetables, fruits, meats, grains, legumes and most other foods. You can even bake breads and desserts! Simple solar cookers cannot stir-fry or cook flat breads that require high temperatures. Do I need to add water to foods that will be solar cooked? Vegetables, fruits and meats cook great without water, which tends to slow cooking and wash away nutrients. For grains and legumes, use the amount of water you use with other cooking methods. If the food comes out too moist or dry, adjust the amount of water next time. What time of year can I cook? In general, you can use your cooker when the length of your shadow on the ground is shorter than your height. This is an indicator that the sun is high enough in the sky to cook. In many countries there are a few months each year when simple solar cookers cannot be used. People living in the darker areas on the following map tend to have longer cooking seasons. What time of day can I cook? You can typically cook two meals per day — a noontime meal and an evening meal. You cannot cook early in the morning or after sunset. The sun is most intense between 10:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m., which is when breads, cakes and pastries should be baked if possible. Faster cooking Slower cooking No cooking"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"SOLAR COOKERS INTERNATIONAL \u0018 How long do foods take to cook? There are many factors that affect the speed with which your food cooks in a solar cooker, including time of year, amount of sun, type of pot and amount of food. The following table summarizes some important factors. Faster cooking Slower cooking Time of year and day: Amount of sun: Amount of wind: Thickness of pot: Amount and size of food: Amount of water:"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"10 SOLAR COOKERS How to make, use and enjoy Simple solar cookers, under normal conditions, will cook at temperatures from 82-121°C (180-250°F) or more. Since food cooks at 82-91ºC (180-195ºF) these temperatures are hot enough to fully cook food, but not so hot as to burn or dry out food or damage healthful nutrients. Also, many foods can cook for several hours without overcooking, which allows food to be placed in the cooker early in the day and left until mealtime without needing to be stirred or monitored. (“Absentee cooking.”) As with any cooking method, cooked food that is allowed to cool to temperatures between 52-10ºC (125-50ºF) for a period of time may contain bacteria that can spoil food and lead to food poisoning. Food that stays in this temperature range for more than four hours should be discarded. Here are some typical cooking times for 4 pounds (2 kilograms) of food on a sunny day: 71 ° C Food pasteurization 65 ° C Water pasteurization 49 ° C Most germs can't grow 22 ° C Room temperature 100 ° C Water boils 135 ° C 82 ° C Food Cooks 275 ° F 212 ° F 160 ° F 150 ° F 180 ° F 120 ° F 72 ° F Simple Solar Cookers 1-2 hours 5 - 8 h o u r s 3 - 4 h o u r s"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"SECTION 3 HOW TO MAKE AND USE SOLAR COOKERS"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"1 \u0018 SOLAR COOKERS How to make, use and enjoy MODEL 1: PANEL COOKER (COOKIT) The CooKit is a simple, portable solar cooker. It can be made in one to two hours and can cook one large pot of food for about six people. For larger families, make a larger CooKit or several this size. Construction materials • Corrugated cardboard (carton board) — 0.9x1.2 meters (3x4 feet) • Aluminum foil — 0.3x3 meters (1x10 feet), cut into strips as needed • Glue (nontoxic, water-based, diluted 1:1 with water) • Paintbrush (the foam type work well) • Utility knife or similar cutting device • Pencil, pen or other marking device • Large ruler or other straight edge • See page 26 for substitute materials Construction steps 1. Draw cut and fold lines on cardboard as indicated below. 73° 90° 98° 99° 61° 12\"/30cm 12\"/30cm 12\"/30cm 12\"/30cm 12\"/30cm 10\"/25cm 11\"/28cm 13\"/33cm 13\"/33cm 8\"/20cm 11\"/28cm 8\"/20cm 5\"/13cm 24\"/61cm 36\"/91cm 48\"/122cm 8\"/20cm 36\"/91cm narrow slot, width of cardboard thickness (about ⅛\"/0.3cm) CUT LINES  FOLD LINES  (optional fold lines for compact storage) 8\"/20cm 11\"/28cm"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"SOLAR COOKERS INTERNATIONAL 1 \u0018 2. Cut out the CooKit shape and slots. Cut out the CooKit shape and the two 60º angled slots in the front panel. Be sure to make the slots narrow so the 7 3 º angled corners from the back panel fit snugly to hold up the front panel. (Refer to step 3, page 14.) 3. Score the fold lines. With a blunt edge, such as a spoon handle, score the fold lines. Make straight folds by folding against a firm straight edge. Only score the optional fold lines if you intend to fold the CooKit for compact storage. (See page 17.) 4. Glue foil on CooKit. Using a paintbrush, spread the glue/water mixture on the dull side of aluminum foil and press the glued sheets of aluminum foil tightly and smoothly like wallpaper onto one entire side of the CooKit. A few wrinkles won’t hurt. 5. Leave flat until dry. Trim any excess foil. Cooking directions 1. Put food in a dark pot with a dark, tight-fitting lid. 2. Enclose pot in a transparent heat trap. Put the pot in a clear, heat-resistant plastic bag and bind the open end of the bag or simply fold it under the pot in such a way as to prevent air from escaping. The bag should be loose enough that a small, insulating layer of air exists around the pot."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"1 \u0018 SOLAR COOKERS How to make, use and enjoy Optional: Cooking efficiency may be marginally improved by placing the pot on a pot “stand” — three or four stones, a couple of twigs, a small wire rack, etc. — located inside the bag. This helps create a thin layer of air under the pot, reducing heat loss to the cooker itself. For optimal performance, Dr. Steven Jones of Brigham Young University recommends raising the pot 6 centimeters with an open-mesh wire stand located inside the bag (see image below). This allows sunlight to be reflected underneath the pot as well as on the sides and top. For best pot stability make the wire stand slightly wider than the pot, and slightly taller than 6 centimeters, so that the pot can rest inside the stand on two crossed wires at the 6 centimeters height. Again, these steps are optional. 3. Assemble the CooKit. In a shaded area, lay the CooKit shiny side up so that the wide (back) panel is away from you. Tilt the back panel towards you and carefully slide the ends of its flaps into the slots on the shorter front panel that is nearest to you. (As you do this you will need to also tilt the front panel up.) Clamp the inserted flaps, on the underside of the front panel, using clothespins or similar device."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"SOLAR COOKERS INTERNATIONAL 15 4. Choose a cooking location. Set the cooker on a dry, level surface in direct sunshine away from potential shadows. For best results, solar cooking requires continuous, direct sunshine throughout the cooking period. 5. Orient the CooKit. Orient the CooKit according to the details below. Once oriented, the CooKit doesn’t need to be moved again during three to four hours of cooking. For longer cooking, or for large quantities of food, reorienting the cooker every couple of hours speeds cooking a little. Food cooks fastest when the shadow created by the cooker is directly behind it. • TO COOK A NOONTIME MEAL orient the cooker so that the shorter, front panel faces easterly, or approximately where the sun will be mid-morning. In general, it is good to get the food out early and not to worry about it until mealtime. For most dishes you should start cooking by 9:00 or 10:00 a.m. • TO COOK AN EVENING MEAL orient the cooker so that the shorter, front panel faces westerly, or approximately where the sun will be mid-afternoon. For most dishes, it is best to start cooking by 1:00 or 2:00 p.m. • FOR ALL-DAY COOKING orient cooker where sun will be at noon or early afternoon and food will be ready and waiting for the evening meal. 6. Adjust front flap. Raise or lower the front flap so there is a small shadow, no more than half its width, under it. The flap should be angled higher when the sun is high and lower when the sun is low. You want the front flap to reflect the sun, not block it. Shadow Shadow"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"1 \u0018 SOLAR COOKERS How to make, use and enjoy 7. Set the bag-enclosed pot on the flat part of the CooKit. Optional: on windy days, large stones or bricks can be placed on each side of the flat part of the CooKit that extends beyond the side reflective panels, as well as under the front panel. 8. Leave food to cook for several hours or until done. There is no need to stir food while it is cooking. 9. Remove the pot. Using pot holders, remove the pot from the CooKit. (Pots get VERY hot.) To prevent steam burns, open the bag away from you when removing the pot, and slide pot lid toward you when opening pot. Enjoy a delicious meal! For less glare from the reflector when putting in or taking out food, stand or squat in front of the CooKit with your back to the sun to make a shadow. Many solar cooks also wear sunglasses."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"SOLAR COOKERS INTERNATIONAL 1 \u0018 Care and storage Store the CooKit in a safe place away from moisture and animals, preferably indoors. Periodically wipe reflective surfaces gently with a dry cloth. If the cardboard (carton board) accidentally gets wet, lay it flat — shiny side down — until dry. Allow plastic bags to air-dry or gently wipe dry with a towel. Heat-resistant bags, handled properly, should last 10 or more uses. Bags gradually become brittle from exposure to sunlight and heat, and will eventually develop small tears. Tape can be applied to the outside of small tears to temporarily extend bag usefulness. The CooKit is designed to be compact and portable. When not in use it can be simply folded lengthwise into thirds or, if needed, folded flat to about 33 centimeters (13 inches) square.

It cooks two to three pots of food. If rocks or bricks are heated alongside the pots, the box cooker will maintain heat for a couple of hours after sunset with the lid closed. Construction materials • Two large, shallow corrugated cardboard (carton board) boxes, nestable as follows: An INNER BOX at least 45x55 centimeters (18x22 inches), preferably just a little bit taller than your pots. An OUTER BOX a little larger in all dimensions so there is at least 3-5 centimeters (1-2 inches) space between the two boxes on all sides when nested. Ideal proportions: one unit tall by two units long (front to back) by three units wide (side to side). Cookers that are too tall create shadows across the pot and increase heat loss through walls. • Corrugated cardboard (carton board) at least 15 centimeters (6 inches) longer and wider than the outer box to make the lid • Window glass at least 50x60 centimeters (20x24 inches) and longer and wider than the inner box • Thin, black metal sheet, sized equal to or slightly smaller than the inner box • Aluminum foil — 0.3x20 meters (1x60 feet), cut into strips as needed • Dry plant fibers or about 50 sheets of newspaper, quartered and loosely crumpled • Glue (nontoxic, water-based) • Silicone caulk • Rigid wire (hanger wire, etc.), or a stick and string — 0.7 meters (2 feet) each • Paintbrush (the foam type work well) • Utility knife or similar cutting device • Pencil, pen or other marking device • Large ruler or other straight edge • See page 26 for substitute materials Glass Lid piece Metal sheet Inner box Outer box"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"SOLAR COOKERS INTERNATIONAL 1 \u0018 Construction steps 1. Cut window opening in outer box. Turn outer box upside-down. On its bottom, center the inner box and draw a line around it. Cut out this piece to make a window opening the same size as the inner box. There should be a small rim on all four sides 5-7 centimeters (2-3 inches) wide. 2. On lid piece, make fold lines and cut window opening/reflector flap. Center the outer box on the lid piece and trace around it (these are fold lines). Extend these lines out to the edges of the lid piece. Center the inner box between the fold lines on the lid (that you just drew) and trace around this box as well. Cut only three sides of the inner line — two short sides and one long one. Fold up the resulting flap for the reflector, creating a window frame opening the same size as the inner box."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"\u0018 0 SOLAR COOKERS How to make, use and enjoy 3. Adjust height of boxes, if needed. Set a cooking pot next to both boxes. The inner box needs to be just a little taller than your pots. The outer box needs to be just a little taller than the inner box. If the boxes are too tall: ON THE INNER BOX make a mark about 3 centimeters (1 inch) above the top of the pot and draw a fold line straight around the four box walls. Score the fold lines with a blunt edge such as a spoon handle. ON THE OUTER BOX make a mark about 5 centimeters (2 inches) above the top of the pot and draw a fold line straight around the four box walls. Score the fold lines with a blunt edge such as a spoon handle. Cut the corners of both boxes down to the fold lines. Fold sides outwards along the creases. 4. Trim inner box flaps. When the walls of the inner box are folded down to the right height — or if you didn’t have to adjust your box height — trim off at about 5-7 centimeters (2-3 inches) above the folded crease to make flaps as narrow as the small rim around the window opening on the outer box.

Spread glue on the inside of the rim. Turn the inner box upside down and lower it into the outer box, onto the glue. Press the small flaps against the inside of the rim around the window opening to join the two boxes into one double-walled box, now open at the bottom (which should be facing up at this point). 6. Insulate and seal. Without disturbing the drying glue, carefully spot-glue aluminum foil on both walls and the underside of the inner box, covering all surfaces between the two boxes. This layer of foil helps to insulate the cooker. Lightly fill the gaps between the two boxes with crumpled newspaper, plant fiber or other insulation. Add a few strips of cardboard and more crumpled newspaper or other insulation on the underside of the inner box (which should be facing up at this point). Close and glue the flaps of the outer box to seal the bottom of the cooker."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"\u0018\u0018 SOLAR COOKERS How to make, use and enjoy 7. Glue foil inside the box and lid. Turn box right-side up. Dilute glue 1:1 with water and, using a paintbrush, spread it thinly on the dull side of sheets of aluminum foil. Press the glued sheets of aluminum foil tightly and smoothly like wallpaper to the inside and rim of the box. A few wrinkles won’t hurt. Set aside to dry. Repeating the procedure, glue foil to the underside of the lid flap (the folded up center part only). 8. Cut, fold and glue the corners of the new lid. With the lid upside down (foil facing up), make one cut at each of the four lid corners, just to the first fold lines. (Cuts should be parallel to the long side of the lid.) Score all fold lines with a blunt edge such as a spoon handle and fold along creases with a straight edge. Overlap and glue the corners, and hold with clothes pins or clamps until the glue is dry. To make quick clamps, cut cardboard-width slits in a small stack of cardboard pieces. 9. Insert the window. Spread silicone caulk along the underside edge of the window opening rim (outside the cut edge of the foiled reflector piece), then press the glass in firmly but carefully to make a good seal with the caulk.

Don’t use tape for inner cooker surfaces. Dark cooking pots Food is solar cooked in lidded, dark-colored pots or similar vessels. Thin metal pots work best. Tinted glass baking dishes also work, as do heavy metal, ceramic or clay pots, but the mass of these materials absorbs heat resulting in a slower cooking process."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"SOLAR COOKERS INTERNATIONAL \u0018\u0018 If you don’t have dark-colored pots and lids, you can paint them black (outer surfaces only). Dull, nontoxic latex or blackboard paints are preferred. If oil-based paint is used, “bake” the pot in the sun for several days to get rid of any odor. Water-based glue mixed with soot or poster paint works also, but is less durable. Glass jars with lids can be used if painted black. You can place a vertical strip of tape on the jar before painting and then remove the tape, leaving a space to view food while cooking. Canning jars and lids are recommended because they are designed to release excessive steam pressure if needed. Transparent heat traps Transparent heat traps let in sunlight and hold in heat. In panel cookers this is typically a heat-resistant plastic bag — able to withstanding temperatures up to 150ºC (300ºF) — surrounding the cooking pot. In box cookers this is a glass or plastic window. TRANSPARENT HEAT TRAPS FOR PANEL COOKERS: • Polypropylene bags • Nylon (polyamide) bags, a common type of “oven bag” • Polyester bags, a common type of “oven bag” • High-density polyethylene (HDPE) bags — the crinkly-sounding bags with handles used to carry goods from stores in many countries, often bearing the #2 recycle symbol — are acceptable if mostly clear • Inverted glass or Pyrex® bowls over the cooking pot, if big enough to rest directly on the cooker to seal the air space around the pot. (Note: over time, moisture released during cooking can damage cardboard solar cookers. If you use an inverted bowl, consider placing the pot and the bowl on a clear glass tray or dish with a slightly raised edge to prevent accumulated moisture from running onto and damaging the cooker.) TRANSPARENT HEAT TRAPS FOR BOX COOKERS: • Ordinary window glass or old car windows if un-tinted • A double layer of heat-resistant plastics, either polypropylene, polyester or polycarbonate, 4-mil thick with 1 centimeter (1/4 inch) air space between. Some thicker plastics work fine with one layer. Don’t use most plastics or fiberglass, which may give off fumes when heated. • Large “oven bags” may be glued to the window frame with a little air space between two layers"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"\u0018\u0018 SOLAR COOKERS How to make, use and enjoy Reflective surfaces Most solar cookers use one or more reflective surfaces to deliver extra sunlight to the cooking pot. Reflectors should be shiny, fairly rigid, and not easily damaged. We recommend aluminum foil mounted on cardboard, which makes for a simple, effective reflector. Other reflective surfaces: • Aluminized polyester film (Mylar®), if reflective, can be used for panel cookers and the reflector(s) on top of a box cooker. Don’t use inside a box cooker, however, because it might melt or give off fumes. (This material can be tricky to adhere to rigid backing. It can be sewn on if necessary.) • Mirrors, though they are heavy and fragile NOT recommended: • Sheet metals, including aluminum and steel, aren’t extremely reflective and tend to absorb some radiation, making them less effective. (The exception is certain anodized aluminums.) • Metallic paints are not reflective enough Insulation (box cooker only) Insulation materials must be poor conductors of heat and tolerate high temperatures without melting or giving off fumes. Newspapers — quartered and loosely crumpled — are cheap, readily available and easy to work with. Other insulation materials: • An extra layer of foil-covered cardboard (carton board) and empty air spaces in each wall • Dry plant fibers — rice hulls, straw, walnut or peanut (groundnut) shells, coconut fibers, dried banana leaves • Feathers • Wool • DON’T USE Styrofoam, polyvinyl or other plastics that melt or give off fumes at cooking temperatures"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"SECTION 4 SOLAR RECIPES AND TIPS"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"\u0018 0 SOLAR COOKERS How to make, use and enjoy You can cook almost anything in your solar cooker, including vegetables, meats, grains and legumes. You can even bake breads and desserts! However, simple solar cookers cannot stir-fry or cook flat breads that require high temperatures. Tips: • Solar cooking is not an exact science. Many factors influence cooking temperatures and times, including time of year, time of day and intensity of sun. Expect cooking times at least double what you are used to. In general, put the food out early and don’t worry about it. Solar cooking is easy! • Foods cook fastest between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., when the sun’s energy is most intense. • Thin, black, metal pots with lids work best. Shallow, wide pots are better than tall, narrow ones. See page 26 for pot options. • The amount, volume and height of food in the pot influence cooking speed. Small quantities of food, and food cut into small pieces, cook fastest. Food should be no deeper than a hand width. • When recipes instruct to “add this, cook 10 minutes, then add that,” you can usually just put all the ingredients in at once. • Many, if not most, of your favorite recipes will work in a solar cooker — often without any adjustments. Slow-cooker recipes work particularly well.

Water that has been heated to 65ºC (149ºF) for a short period of time is free from microbes including Escherichia coli, Rotaviruses, Giardia and the Hepatitis A virus. At around 71ºC (160ºF), milk and food are pasteurized. Boiling is not required. Microbe Killed rapidly at Worms, Protozoa cysts ( Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Entamoeba ) 55°C (131°F) Bacteria ( V. cholerae, E. coli, Shigella, Salmonella typhi ), Rotavirus 60°C (140°F) Hepatitis A virus 65°C (149°F) Why pasteurize? Worldwide, unsafe water is a major health problem. Over one billion people do not have access to safe water. Preventable waterborne diseases are responsible for approximately 80% of all illnesses and deaths in the developing world. Children are especially susceptible, with nearly two million deaths each year. Diseases spread through contaminated water include Amoebiasis (Amoebic Dysentery) , Campylobacteriosis, Cholera, Cryptosporidiosis, Dracunculiasis (Guinea Worm disease), Giardiasis, Hepatitis A , Shigellosis (Bacillary Dysentery) and Typhoid Fever. How is pasteurization accomplished? Traditional fuels can be used to pasteurize water, but on sunny days solar energy can be used as well. Simple solar cookers can pasteurize water for a family at a rate of about one liter (one quart) per hour. Solar Cookers International’s reusable Water Pasteurization Indicator (WAPI) can be used to determine when water heated by solar or conventional means has reached appropriate temperatures to make it safe. Solar pasteurization directions 1. Pour water into a black pot or jar of the type used for cooking. 2. Position WAPI along string. Slide the WAPI to the end of the string so that the wax end is furthest from the adjacent washer."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"SOLAR COOKERS INTERNATIONAL \u0018 1 3. Place WAPI in water. Place the WAPI, wax end up, in the water with the opposite end of the string draped outside the pot or jar. The WAPI should rest on the bottom of the pot or jar (near the middle) and the wax end should be highest. Replace the lid. If using a glass jar, the lid should have a small hole in it or be loosely screwed on to release steam pressure. 4. Orient the solar cooker as you would for cooking. In general, face the cooker easterly in the morning and westerly in the afternoon. 5. Set the pot or jar in the cooker. If using a panel-type solar cooker, such as the CooKit, you can speed pasteurization by placing the pot or jar inside a clear, heat-resistant plastic bag. Though a plastic bag is required for cooking in this type of cooker, it is often not necessary for pasteurizing. 6. Allow water to heat. Leave the cooker in a sunny place for a number of hours, reorienting if necessary. Allow at least one hour per liter (quart) of water. 7. Determine if pasteurization has occurred. When the WAPI wax melts and falls to the bottom of the WAPI, the water has been pasteurized. Even if the water has cooled by the time you check it, as long as the wax is at the bottom of the WAPI then pasteurization has occurred. If you do not have a WAPI, you will need to either measure the water temperature using an alternate device or observe the water boiling. 8. Allow the water to cool before drinking. Keep pasteurized water covered until use to prevent recontamination. Don’t let fingers or unclean objects touch clean water. If you aren’t sure, re-pasteurize water. Safety Notice: Pasteurization does not remove dangerous chemicals, like arsenic. Pasteurization is not the same as sterilization , a process whereby everything, including heat- resistant spores, is killed. The heat-resistant spores that survive pasteurization are harmless to drink. Where sterilized liquids are needed — in hospitals and in certain food canning processes, for example — high temperatures are achieved using special pressure cookers.

When these medical supplies — such as instruments, bandages and other cloth materials — are heated to 149ºC (300ºF) for a short period of time they are free from nearly all organisms. Larger solar cookers reach this temperature and, in difficult field conditions, can help save lives. Disinfection of liquids requires special equipment and cannot be accomplished with ordinary solar cookers. Preserve (“can”) foods Acidic foods — tomatoes and many fruits — can be preserved or “canned” in airtight containers because their acid prevents food-spoiling organisms from growing. (Vegetables cannot be canned in a solar cooker.) Canning in a solar cooker is similar to “open-kettle” canning on a stove, except the jars don’t need to stand in water. Follow regular canning instructions: fill jars almost to the top with fruit and juice and put lids on loosely. Heat two to four jars at a time until juices start to bubble over. (In a panel cooker, the jars can all go in one bag.) Tighten lids, then cool. Check the lids to confirm a good seal, indicated by a concave dip in the middle of the lid. Reheat if necessary. Heat water for multiple purposes Dry foods (small quantities only) Solar cookers are designed to hold in moisture whereas food dryers need airflow to carry away moisture. However, a panel cooker or box cooker lid can dry small quantities of food: put food (uncovered and open to the air) in the middle of the reflector or on top of the box window.

British astronomer John Herschel used a box cooker in South Africa in 1830. The first recorded use in the United States was by Samuel P. Langley while climbing Mt. Whitney in 1881. In the 1860s Mouchot in Algeria first cooked with a curved concentrator. Charles Abbot made a box with curved mirrored frames to focus onto a container of motor oil. This heated to 177ºC (351ºF) and allowed cooking in the evening with stored heat. In the United States, Maria Telkes researched several combination types in the early 1900s. Early solar cookers were expensive and inconvenient. In the 1970s disappearing trees and growing fuel shortages rekindled worldwide interest. Governments of India and China developed and promoted solar box and curved concentrator cookers. In the USA Barbara Kerr and Sherry Cole developed simple-to-make box cookers, as well as solar food dryers and sterilizers. Bob Metcalf has and continues to research solar water pasteurization and shares the knowledge in many countries. Kerr, Cole, Metcalf and others founded Solar Cookers International (SCI) in 1987 to spread solar cooking benefits to people and environments worldwide. Today many hundreds of engineers, educators, Peace Corps volunteers, community development workers, retirees, government workers, Rotary clubs, universities, religious groups and refugee programs are sharing solar skills. As just a few examples, SERVE has brought solar cooking to thousands in Pakistan. The University of Chile, with Teresa Guzman , Pedro Serrano et al., brought solar cooking to Villa Seca, a village where most families solar cook and a solar restaurant is a tourist attraction. Severe droughts in the 1990s prompted SCI to refine the ultra-simple CooKit by Roger Bernard (France) and share it worldwide and with more than 30,000 refugee families in sun-rich eastern Africa.
