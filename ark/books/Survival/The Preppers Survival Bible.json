Everyone will face an emerge ncy at some point in their lives. It could be an earthquake, another natural disaster , pandemic, or even war . If life teaches us anything, it is that we should always be prepared for the worse. If you are unsure where to start preparing for any kind of disaster or emergency , this book will help you ensure that you're well prepared. You will be taken through everything, from mentally and emotionally preparing yourself to stockpiling, canning, off-grid living, and much more. However , unlike other resources, you will be given the best advice from people who actually know what they're doing and teach you how to do it for yourself. It doesn't matter if you're preparing for a natural disaster , a car accident, being unemployed, a pandemic, or even the long-term decline of the economy or society . If you wait until you're ready, it's far too late. It's time to get started now . But don't think you are on your own in this. All around the world, sane and rational citizens are preparing for the worst to happen. This number continues to grow daily as they realize they can't rely on the government or other people. In a crisis, the only person you and your family can rely on is yourself. However , as you prep, it is easy to feel overwhelmed and confused. What makes things even worse is that many people out there take this to new levels, go to the extreme, crazy with conspirac y theories, or just spout dangerous information that has no benefits for you. Prepping for the worst is simply to help you in the event of something terrible going wrong in your life and aid your recovery from these events when they occur. That's it. Do not believe that prepping has anything to do with stockpiling weapons in some underground bunker in the middle of nowhere. You mustn't just read the checklist and ignore the rest of the book. Within these pages is valuable information that will save you a lot of"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"wasted time, energy , and funds. Also, you can help friends and family avoid making mistakes. The best part of prepping for the worst is ensuring you're doing it right, having the right information, and ensuring those around you are doing the same. Fundamental steps to prepping include: Ensuring you have a solid financial and health foundation to build upon. Have your home prepared for two weeks without being forced to leave it. Being able to leave the house in seconds, fully prepared Being prepared for any kind of emergency that occurs away from the home Practicing the essential skills, you will need Share your knowledge and help others as you continue to learn and grow from your current skill level. Everything that you read within these pages is tailored toward those who want reliable, rational, and helpful advice in simple-to-read terms. The information you find will apply to everyone, regardless of location, budget, or scenario. It doesn't matter if you're concerned with the state of politics, a natural disaste r, the failing economy , or running away from an abusive ex. It doesn't matter if you've already been through one or even more disasters or emergencies. You are not alone. You are one of the intelligent people who understand the concept of being ready and prepared. Most people don't broadcast what they're doing to others. It's not strange, it's not weird, and certainly , nothing to be ashamed of. Some people don't tell their partners, children, or parents; they simply learn what they need to know and implement these skills without them knowing."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"No one can predict the future. It's a fact of life that terrible things happen along with the good. Enjoying the good while it happens and preparing for the worst is important. As you start prepping, you must be diligent and discover anything that could set you back. Be realistic in your approach to prepping. If you only have a little space in your home, don't plan to stock up with crates and crates of canned food and toilet paper. Stay focused on simple things, and certainly don't think you're preparing for a zombie apocalypse. Whatever steps you follow, do not allow it to overwhelm you and make you throw in the towel. Don't walk down a path full of Rambo or doomsday fantasies. Don't waste your money on purchasing ten years' worth of supplies. Prepping can be done in fun and enjoyable ways. Definitely ignore the doomsday-sayers that you see on the internet. These are extremists who shout and yell from the sidelines. Unfortunately , many are now spreading through YouTube, TikTok, Facebook, and many forums. If you see them, ignore them, or try another place where the madness isn't trying to take over . Prepping is much more enjoyable and successful when you're doing it with people with the same mindset. Several online groups, websites, and in-person clubs are full of great and practical information. Another good thing to watch out for is doubling up on the items and gear you have. Keep your gear in the correct place to ensure it doesn't get lost, and you buy another item. For those on a budget, purchase high-quality goods that you know aren't going to break after using them a few times. Prepping is not buying a few pieces of gear, throwing them into a bag and dumping it in a cupboard under your stairs, and thinking you're ready for anything. Preparing means having the right items, a solid plan, and practicing with those things. A bug-out bag is not just for taking on a location you already have set out on a map or in your head. A bug-out bag is the one bag you"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"automatically get as soon as you need to depart your home. A bug- out bag is what you need when your plans go to hell. Organization Based on Y our Threats It is normal for people to ask, \"What are you preparing for?\" when you ask for help. Don't discard this question, as it can help you obtain the right information for your specific plans and events. It also helps you remain practical and keeps your feet on the ground before all the doomsday conspiracists start luring you to their sides. However , one downside to this question is that you will get the information for that one specific event. Why is this a downside? Because you will get informat ion that leaves you less prepared for all disasters rather than just one specific event. Or you may get the impression that you must prepare for all events in certain ways. The great thing about the information in this book is that it will apply to about ninety-eight percent of everyone and the various scenarios you could prepare for . Once you have sorted out the key things that can be trickier to start with, such as growing plants inside a building instead of an outside garden, the rest tends to fall into place. You will need to add and modify things on top of these essentials, depending on your location and risks. For example, do you live in a location prone to flooding or cyclones? However , the key information will be the same for everyone."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Chapter One: Why You Should Be Organized As the old saying goes, be prepared, and prevent. Everyone, regardless of how old they are, where they live, their background, religious or political beliefs, or how much money they have, should be prepared for whatever emergency life throws their way. Your family needs to be prepared. This includes your spouse, children, siblings, parents, friends, colleagues, and neighbors; you need to be prepared. It doesn't matter if you're eighteen and going off to university for the first time or if you're a forty-year-old mother with three kids. Y ou need to be prepared. Preparing for what life hands out to you is not bad. It's not a crazy thing to do. It is not what only insane doomsday conspiracy theorists do in their underground bunkers. Most prep people are sane, rational, and practical and come from all ethnic, religious, and socio- political backgrounds. In recent years, a high proportion of those prepping for the worst move operate in the high circles that influence how things operate in our world. They know the outcomes based on the evidence they've seen and are preparing for the day when the worst will hit them. For most people, the world is a great place. Most of us have good access to healthcare, healthy foods, and clean drinking water. But as we have seen in recent years, the comforts that we take for granted can be taken from us in the blink of an eye, and history shows us that after a period of good times, the bad times inevitably follow . However , the world is nowhe re near as stable as we imagine it is. And unfortunately , the instability and unpredictability are steadily declining. Our honeymoon period is over. Earth is changing, and more and more disasters are occurring due to these changes. The key factors in the world's economies affect how we live and work, which then changes our experiences."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Let's face it, governments worldwide are not addressing the problem. Likely, those who do won't actually do anything about it. As humans, we are well-known for our ability to adapt to the circumstances thrown our way, but there is no way that it will be a painles s process. Prepping for the worst is therefore essential. However , many people do enjoy doing it. For some, they take great pride in ensuring the well-being of their families; others feel selfless in helping their communities that require aid, while for others, it gives them the sense of being free. It can also be enjoyable and satisfying. It allows you to be out in the fresh air, surrounded by nature. It gives you the chance to learn new things about your environment, learn new skillsets, and even challenge your mind to come up with new scenarios to prepare yourself and your family for . Whatever the case, you will find deep peace in the knowledge that you are prepared and won't be a mindless victim of circumstance. If anything should go wrong, having a few essential supplies could mean the dif ference between survival and death."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"You Need to Be Prepared Your mind could come up with hundreds of scenarios – the loss of a job, an abusiv e ex after you and the kids, an earthquak e, a global pandemic. Out of them all, you are most likely to go through at least once in your lifetime. Most likely several. A high number of the world's most intelligent and sensible experts have come to the same outcome – over the next century , things will only worsen. The evidence is strong and fearful. You must start imagining what the worst could be and how to prepare for it."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Preppers Are Not Crazy It's an outdated and harmful stereotype. The majority of those who prep are not hermits living out in the wilderness with stockpiles of canned goods, guns, and ammo, shooting at anyone who gets near them because the governmen t is inserting microchips in the backs of their necks to maintain their Big Brother grip on the population. When preppers were first introduced in the media, they were shown as extremists on the alt-right side of politics and lived in the most isolated parts of the country . Most were extremists in many ways, especially in how they prepared. When you first step into the prepping world, you must remember that social media tends to use extremists (no matter the subject or what side of the spectrum they fall upon) to get views. This isn't to say that what the media puts out is fake, just that the more extreme, the more views (and more money in many cases). However , these days, preppin g is much more common than you may think, and the stereotypes of preppers are not applicable."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"You Can't Predict What Is Going to Happen It is normal to think about the future and plan for it. It could be buying your first home, saving for a rainy day fund, or even saving up to send your child to university . And, as much as we don't like to admit it, we are not quite as good at it as we wish. For example, we know it is a good idea to write a will to ensure what we leave behind goes to the right people. However , many of us still haven't written one out yet. We know that most of us will retire at some point, but how many of us have started a retirement fund? We know that we should look after our bodies, but how many of us will order takeaway or put of f going to the doctor or dentist? There are a variety of reasons why we don't do this. Sometimes we procrastinate. Sometimes it seems such a far-off time until it happens, so we don't need to do it today. Sometimes it takes too long for what we want. Sometimes the payout doesn't seem worth it right now . Sometimes we bury our heads in the sand. The reasons why we put things off or don't do them at all even though we know we shouldn’t really matter in the end. As humans, we are imperfe ct, and the systems that we find ourselves in are just as imperfect. Still, disasters can and do occur, and we must prepare for them. Modern history might be a freak period of luck. Humans have been on this earth for around 250,000 years. During that time, life has been nothing but hard. Access to reasonably good healthcare and shelter has only been around for the last two centuries, and good quality of life has only been around for the last 75 years or so. How the richest one percent lived a hundred years ago is how the average middle-class person enjoys life today . The last twenty to thirty years of history have been a freak period of good luck. When we look at history, it's easy to see a pattern of improved living which is quickly followed by a period of decline. For example, Roman Britain saw a period of high culture and standard of healthcare only"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"to be followed by the Dark Ages, where culture and healthcare were substantially worse. We must look to the past to determine what the future may hold for us. Just because we are alive in a period of good luck, where the healthcare and hygiene are good, doesn't mean bad times are not coming. Because they are, do not be one of the ignorant masses that believes that nothing can get worse. No one believed that a virus from overseas could bring the world to a standstill, but in 2019, Covid-19 did just that. Humans are good at surviving . Throughout history, we have survived floods, earthquakes, tsunam is, global diseases, wars, famines, droughts, and the falls of entire civilizations. However , we have survived it. But just because things are fine right now doesn't mean they always will. After all, the Romans believed that their civilization could never fall. Rome fell hard, impacting three continents when it did. All the experts – scientists, politicians, historians, economists, and many others – all state the same thing. How we are living right now is not sustainable. You can compare it to having a mortgage on a property you cannot af ford the payments on. The bank will eventually foreclose on your property and take it away . We are the ones living in that house right now, and the banks are knocking on the door . Some debt is a good thing. We take out debt to get an education, get a good job, pay back the money we borrowed, and then use the rest to set us up in a home we love and pay for the things we need. This is good in an economy that is growing, but when you realize that the economy isn't growing and there is too much debt, it is important to understand its implications. We are running on borrowed time. We've outsourced much of our goods production and labor services to much cheaper countries. However , these countries are realizing the consequences and are"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"now focusing on long-term sustainability rather than short-term objectives. Do you really believe – right down in your gut – that the world will be better for your children's generation the way things are going? Statistics show that thirty-seven percent of Americans believe they will. Only twenty percent of millennials believe they will have a better quality of life than the Baby Boomers, who are at sixty-seven percent. If the world and our quality of life improved, those percentages would be higher . There is something terribly wrong with the way things are going."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Steady Declines and Sudden Disasters Freak storms, a sudden flood, war – all these disasters have one thing in common – they can occur and destroy your current life as you know it in a very short time. These are the events that are easier to prep for. You need to get your emergency bag out, grab your plan and supplies, and then you're ready to go. Slower decline s are harder to prepare for. However , you must think and plan ahead for these scenarios because if history has shown us anything, they can, and do, occur more frequently than we would like to admit. One example. China and your country attacks. To increase your chances of survival, you decide to get off the grid. However , if inflation and energy costs rise thirty percent each year, or there are numerous blackouts, the same prep for China attacking will benefit you all the same. Research has shown that the average individual's chances of slow declines in their systems (such as electricity , water, and food) are around the same as the chances of a sudden disaster or a long period of unemployment. There are times when things such as floods are both slow and abrupt. The coastline is gradually eroding steadily each year, increasing the risks of sudden floods. At the same time, it also reduces the home prices of properties on the coastline and therefore impacts the economy and displacement of those who live there. Over the last few decades, politicians have been sweeping the effects and costs of such things under the rug, so to speak, which leaves the majority of the population to think that life has never been so good or that things will get better and better. However , experts know the truth all too well. And it doesn't look good for any of us. Let us take a look at a few examples. Weather . We are currently going through a period of climate change. Worldwide, we see more storms, floods, rising temperatures, and"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"less rain. These impact our food production, clean water distribution, and the destruction of homes and the environment. Water. Droughts around the world are impacting millions of lives. Even in America, in places such as Austin, Texas, and in Flint, Michigan, hundreds of thousa nds do not have access to clean water, and the government refuses to step in and do its jobs to protect these people."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Food. The entire world can be fed for five years with what we produce right now. However , millions of people of all ages in every country worldw ide are dying of starvation because of a lack of distribution. We have seen an upwards trend in producing food inside buildings, along with organic food production and other innovative technologies. However , food can run out when emergencies appear , and people panic buy, or entire batches can be tainted due to various issues. Governmental Control. All around the world, we see governments implementing control over the population through rigged elections, forced camps, forced sterilization, curfews, etc. How far will your country's government go to ensure they have control over your life for their benefit? Employment. It's a fact of life that just because you work doesn't mean you can provide for your family. 75 years ago, one person could go to work and pay the mortgage and rest of the bills while the other parent stayed at home to raise the children. Nowadays,"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"parents can work three jobs and still can't afford to buy healthy foods for their kids. With jobs refusing to pay living wages, we are likely at the start of a period that will see a rapid incline in unemplo yment and even lower wages."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Regional Emergencies Compared to National Disasters Some disaster s can happen in your immediate location, while others can be on a national or global scale. A collapse of society will affect every single person in the country, but some disasters will only affect your home, your neighborhood, town, or state/province/county . It is therefore important to prep for big and smaller disasters that will only affect you and your family. This could be a car crash, your house burning down, or a long period of unemployment. A century ago, we knew how to survive with no money and no permanent shelter . We had the skills to build a shelter without going to the store or to fish and hunt to feed our families. We had the skills to survive after a natural disaster , to live off the grid. We could create a feast with next to nothing, mend, and make our own clothing to keep warm. Can any of us say that in this day and age? Recent surveys conducted in America have shown that eighty percent of people wouldn't know how to feed themselves or find clean water in the wild, and fifty-three percent of people wouldn't have three days’ worth of non-perishable food and drinking water . Here is a list of emergencies that you could possibly face at some point: Getting lost while hiking. Getting stuck in a lift. Having no power for more than 12 hours. Frozen water pipes. Dangerous animals in your garden. Your house is burning down A carjacking. Your house is robbed. You are mugged on your way home."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"You experience rape or domestic abuse/violence. You experience a serious medical problem such as a heart attack, a stroke, or paralysis. You get stuck in the snow . You experience a car crash. The average driver is likely to be involved in a car crash every seventeen years. In 2005, over 38,000 people died in a car crash, while 4.4 million were injured or were disabled. It is important to be ready for any kind of emergency . Therefore, you must have a bag containing the things you need to get you home. Keep it stocked at all times and keep it in your car, at work, or somewhere accessible outside the home. This way, if something should happen to you while you're away from home, you have all the essentials you need to survive. These aren't bags that will get you home in case a hoard of angry brain-eating zombies attack you on your way home from the office, but what you may need if you are involved in a car crash or perhaps witness one. You can jump in, call for help, and help the injured instead of sitting on the sidelines, wringing your hands, or TikToking it for everyone else's enjoyment."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Climate Change and Natural Disasters Mother Nature is one mean mama at times. She doesn't care when, how, who, or where. Every year, millions are affected by natural disasters that tend to overwhelm local and even national systems such as ambulances, hospitals, police, coastguards, the army, and many others. Natural disasters disrupt everyone's day-to-day lives, forcing people into situations where they are generally helpless. They tend to lack food, clean water , shelter , clothing, and medical care. Statistics show that around 85,000 people die annually from natural disasters, with another 189 million displaced or otherwise af fected. Flooding is the number one most likely natural disaster , making up forty-three percent of natural disasters and fifty-five percent of those affected. In the last decade, two and a half billion people have been affected by floods. Natural disasters don't only occur in developing countrie s. In June 2008, eleven million people were killed by one flood. Millions have died in China. The United States is one of the top countrie s affected by natural disasters. Around forty-four percent of natural disasters occur in developing countries, with sixty-eight percent of the total deaths. Developing countries make up thirty-four percent of deaths from natural disasters and fifty-six percent of worldwide disasters. Over ninety percent of deaths that occur from heatwaves happen in wealthy countries. In the United States, 30 million people live within the fallout zones of volcanos; 9 million live in high flood areas; 17 million live in zones with tornados. Fires destroy forests, land, and homes annually , killing around 3,500 Americans and injuring 16,000 more. The number of deaths and injuries is steadily rising each year. Climate change is real. Natural disasters occur. The population is growing at alarming rates."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Disasters related to heatwaves and climate are doubled compared to what they were twenty years ago, including wildfires. Sea levels are rising. The Great Barrier Reef was declared dead, the world's oldest and largest living organism. It was 25 million years old and was an important ecosystem supplying us with food. NASA estimates the ocean will be two to six inches higher in the next twenty years. About 170 million Americans live close to the coastline. Within the next generation, it is estimated that around 670 communities along the coastline will be wiped out, according to experts. These include cities such as New Y ork, Oakland, and Miami. Around a million homes within five hundred feet of the coast will be destroyed by flooding. Saltwater will pour into the land, making it unusable for farming. But flooding and rising water levels are not the only things to watch out for. Droughts and famines are much more common, as well as hurricanes, thunderstorms, dust storms, heatwaves, wildfires, and many others. Since 1980, there have been significant increases in the number of wildfires across America. Although new technology has been produced to help combat it, the number of acres destroyed by fire has increased by 400%. As the weather becomes drier and the temperature rises, it is more common than ever to have more frequent, stronger , and longer fires. These fires and other natural disasters are also changing the lives of animals. Much of our diet comprises animal products – meat and dairy in particular . Some scientists have suggested that seventy-five percent of animal species right now could die out by the end of the next generation, making it the sixth mass extinction the world has known.

The government is fairly good at treating the symptoms – sending out the army or medical care, for example – but let's face it; they are absolutely useless at dealing with the issues. They could raise the minimum wage, but what's the point of that when the cost of food has gone up 250%? This has actually happened in several countries in recent years, including V enezuela. When there is a shortage of clean water and safe food, other issues, such as preventable diseases, tend to rise. If you can't afford healthy food, how would you be able to af ford medicine? You cannot rely on the government for anything. The American government must provide care for returning soldiers but fails them every time. They can't even track the whereabouts of several billion dollars of weapons shipped to Iraq during the war . Throughout history, people have learned that you cannot rely on the government, especially during and after a crisis. Even national and local agencies and organizations are severely limited in what support they can provide. Even FEMA can't provide support until after seventy-two hours to put any plans into action due to the government. When an earthquake destroyed 250,000 homes and killed 130,000 people in Haiti in 2010, the Red Cross (a non-governmental organization) received around $500 million from donations to aid Haiti.

Challenges are great, not just for the body but the mind as well. You get more sense of purpose when you challenge yourself or do something meaningful.

It is such a normal part of everyday life for most that it's something you don't really become aware of. The idea is to create a stockpile of the everyday items that you and your family use but will last several months without being touched. These are usually shelf-stabl e items and foods, along with toiletries, batteries, and other items. It is these extra items that become your first layer of emergency goods. Think of it as a mini supermarket in your home, piled with the goods you know your family will want and need. The first step in becoming a good prepper is to have enough items at home to survive without having to leave for at least two weeks. This means no outside help (such as from family and friends) or making a sneaky trip to a shop. Using the First In, First Out method, you can save for this without any extra money , time, or energy . Generations ago, our families used to do this daily. Parents would pick up an extra bag of flour or several cans of food in case something went wrong. It wasn't strange. It was normal. These days, all we have to do is go on the internet, fill up a cart online, pay for it, and the items will arrive at our doors within a day or two. We live"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"quite a lazy lifestyle these days, and we sometimes forget that just because we have things easy now, they may not always be so easy tomorrow . You may have to use those items due to a variety of situations – another outbreak of a COVID-19 strain, being fired or made redundant, an interruption to the food supply (such as Brexit), or even a natural disaster . Sometimes people just practice this model simply because they know their lives are just naturally busy , and they don't have to make more trips to the store than necessary . Let's take a look at what you may do before you start prepping. We will use cans of baked beans since they are non-perishable items, are a great source of protein, and are good items for prepping. You love baked beans and use three cans each week. You go to the supermarket once a fortnight and buy six cans until the next time you go shopping. If an emergency hits, you might have anywhere between zero and six cans of baked beans at home. Now, when you are a prepper , you still use three cans of baked beans every week and still make a trip to the supermarket once every fortnight . Instead of buying six cans of baked beans, you buy nine. You leave and put those nine cans of baked beans in the pantry. You use the six cans of baked beans as you normally would in those two weeks, and by the time you normally go to the supermarket again, you still have three cans of baked beans. However , instead of only buying three cans to add to the three you have at home, you continue to buy nine cans of baked beans. Put the new cans of baked beans behind the extra cans you have at home and use those ones up first. The next time you go shopping, you put those cans behind the ones you already have. When you need to cook the baked beans, you use the cans at the front. You carry on with this cycle by purchasing a few extra items each time you go shopping. That way, when something happens, and you can't get to the supermarket, you are safe knowing that you have a good supply of the items you like."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"What makes this work is having a supply of non-perishable items you normally would buy and use. It's even better when there is a long gap between the time of purchase and the time when it expires because it makes things extremely easy for you. It works best with items with a long shelf life, such as toilet rolls, deodorant, sanitary items, rice, pasta, and canned goods. Some cans of baked beans can last for two years in your pantry. If you use three cans a week, you can use 576 cans over two years. Having 50 cans of baked beans will get you through nearly 17 weeks of self-reliance. If you follow this model, you should be ready for whatever comes your way. 95% of people are not prepared for when disaster strikes. You can be prepared and not spend anything extra on prepping items since you just spend on things that you normally would purchase or make any big changes to your habits. You don't even have to waste time learning how to can or freeze-dry goods. Life can get busy, especially with work and family. If things get in the way, such as tight purse strings or your workload keeps you incredibly busy, you can pause or buy fewer items until the time is right to start rebuilding your stockpile again. For example, it’s been a cold winter, and you've had to use the heating a lot over the months. The bill comes in, and it's much higher than what you were prepared for. You decide to pay it off, but because there's less money in your account now, you use the surplus items in your stockpil e instead of going to the grocery store. You restart building your stockpile when you have more money . It doesn't really matter if you don't use all the items before they expire. You can donate them to a food bank or give them to friends or family. Some items can be used even after a best before date (there are differences betwee n a best before date and expiry date), and some are cheap enough to be replaced."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"St o r i n g Y o u r I t e m s Keep a marker beside your pantry to ensure that nothing goes to waste. Once you purchase an item, write the purchase and expiry dates in big letters on the front. This way, you can easily see when that item needs to be used up, making the First In, First Out model easy to practice. For example, something that needs to be used before December 2023 should be used before something labeled December 2024. You don't have to invest in any kind of fancy storage items, but it can make things a lot easier for you if you organize your goods so that you don't have to keep thinking about what needs to be used first. If you have a large plastic tray, all you need to do is put the items that need to be used first at the front. When you buy new items, simply pull them out and place them in the back. Some fantastic floor-standing organizers allow you to place newly purchased items on the top for canned items. When you grab a can from the bottom, the oldest of the items, the next one rolls down."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"C h a p t e r T h r e e : M o n e y M a n a g e m e n t I s t h e K e y t o G o o d Pr e p p i n g Managing your money and getting your finances in order is one of the core aspects of being a good prepper . It doesn't matter if you have a lot of money or barely anything. Even an average person can improve their financial habits to create a solid foundation for their everyday lives and an emergency . You don't want to be someone who has a large stockpile of items but barely has any money to their name, along with high debt and nothing put aside for retirement or emergencies. If you want to be a good prepper, you need to start thinking about lowering your chances of a terrible event occurring and being prepared for it. Being a reasonable and sensible prepper requires you to be prepared for the situations you are most at risk of experiencing. It can be kind of fun to imagine what would happen should there be a zombie outbreak, and the only way to survive is by staying inside the home, but let's face it, it's not likely to happen. You're much more likely to experience another global pandemic, a disruption to the food supply , or hardships to your own finances. It is this last factor that most preppers start prepping. In America, 51 million households struggle to keep a roof over their heads and put food on the table. 20% of American children go hungry every year. 14% of Americans live below the poverty line. 57% of Americans do not have $1,000 in savings. Every year, 25% of American experience extremely financial hardships. Around 46% of Americans cannot afford to pay $400 in car repairs without relying on a credit card. 26% of Americans have nothing in their emergency savings account. Average Americans have a debt of $125,000, and those with debts of $16,000 pay 17% in interest payments. The average student loan debt for graduates in 2016 was $37,000. More than 25 million Americans cannot afford medical help or purchase medicine such as"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"insulin. Soaring medical costs have left 620,000 Americans declaring bankruptcy . More than 50% of Americans have no savings for retirement, and less than 20% say they have saved enough for that time. Millennials have savings 30% smaller than any other generation. More than 80% of the gains are received by the top one percent of the wealthiest population. Most average people haven't had any improvements to the economy in years. Data and statistics don’t show things improving in the future. In fact, it shows that things will only get worse for those who are not in the top five percent. Changes to the demographics and the job losses combined with automated and machine dependency will only worsen the situation. Problems with finances can have a severe and devastat ing impact on your life. Your children face more disadvantages, your performance at work decreases, divorces, depression, stress, mental health issues, bankruptcy , living paycheck to paycheck, getting further and further into debt – the list goes on and on, and it's not a good experience for anyone. For those looking to prep, you are less likely to be successful if you suffer from financial problem s due to fewer resources and options. For example, you've got to go to the doctor to treat your back pain, but your car breaks down and needs significant repairs. You pay for the car repairs so you can continue to get to work, but now your back is so painful without treatme nt that you are forced to stay off work. You get fired, and then all the bills start piling up, and you are in considerable debt. It's perfectly acceptable to start prepping even if your finances are not as strong as others. You may start working on the fundamentals of your prepping checklist while trying to lower your debt and create savings for emergencies. Remember to be practical and, if need be, seek advice from a professional."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"C r e a t i n g a n Em e r g e n c y F u n d There are several reasons why it is important to have an emergency fund set aside to last you for three to six months. These include such situations: To bail out a family member Stockpiling necessary items before a storm Dealing with an unexpected funeral A serious medical issue Parking tickets A car accident An outbreak of disease A series of riots Loss of employment Fleeing domestic violence"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Having a fund that could tide you over for three to six months can be incredibly reassuring. It gives you peace of mind knowing that, should one of these situations happen or something even worse, you are secure in the knowledge that you can get through it. Experts said you should always have enough funds for three months a few years ago. However , these days it has gone up to have funds to cover you for six months. This is because decent-payin g jobs are harder to find even with degrees, there are fewer social security nets to fall back onto, and food and housing prices are rising. You should keep your emergency fund accounts separate from your savings and retirement funds. Great preppers are ready at all times. If something should happen, you should always have your bag ready, and you are good to go. This is exactly the same for your emergency funds account. You need to look at it as your bug-out bag. You don't go into it; you don't even look at it until there is an emergency . You don't dip into it to buy those designer shoes that are on sale right now or use it for any other reason, even if you intend to put the funds back in next week. Most people won't be able to replace the funds, and an emergency will suddenly occur . After a while, you can diversify your emergency funds to include online saving s, cash, precious metals, and even bitcoin. Cryptocurrency can be overwhelming or even confusing to some, but it can be a good backup plan in an emergency . You should look into it and do thorough research."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"I t ' s T i m e t o St a r t It's something that you will read a lot, but it's true. You must start now. If you don't start planning now, you are losing out. Compound interest and rewards that come with investing accumulate each month. The more time you waste in failing to start saving, the more funds you are wasting. It's the difference between saving for retirement age 21 instead of 31. Your future, and the future of your family , are incredibly important. Each time you get paid from your job, you pay yourself first. You place 10% of your paycheck in your emergency funds, another 10% in your retirement fund, and another 10% into your savings account. It's highly recommended. If your funds are tight, try paying yourself 5% for the first year and then increase it to 10% the following year. It is highly recommended that you start establishing and cementing the habit rather than focusing on the actual numbers. Setting up an automated transfer on the day you get paid is a good idea. If you know you get paid on the first of each month, create a standing order or a direct debit so that 10% of your paycheck automatically goes into your retirement, savings, and emergency fund. This way, you know exactly what you have left to play with each month. Regarding debt, you must prioritize getting it down as low as possible before you start saving up for anything else."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"L o o k i n g a t Y o u r Ex p e n s e s It is believed that if you look at your weight each day, you will make better choices regarding what you eat for the rest of the day. You don't have to deal with fad diets, counting calories, or trying to stick to a program that will make you miserable – all you do is step on the scales and make sensible decisions. It is exactly the same regarding your finances. Budgeting is equivalent to counting calories. Look at your finances regularly and allow yourself to make responsible choices. Do you only have $100 in your account but need to pay off your credit card bill? Don't go to Starbucks and spend $15 on some ridiculously sugar-crammed concoction that doesn't taste like coffee. Make a flask of your favorite coffee and drink that on the way to work instead. Maybe you'll see that you're paying for a gym subscription or an app that you don't bother using. Maybe you're eating fast food far too much. Some apps or bank features that monitor your spending habits could come in handy ."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Es t a b l i s h a Se n s i b l e B u d g e t Budgets are just like diets. We hate them, and we rarely stick to them. However , when we stick to them, they are incredibly ef fective. A good method is the 50 – 30 – 20 budget. In this, you pay 50% of your income for your essentials, such as housing and healthcare costs, 30% for things you desire (such as clothing, shoes, and going out to eat), and 20% for debts, retirement, and emergency funds. For example, let's say you earn $6000 a month. You pay $3000 for your rent/mortgage, utilities, travel gas, car payment, groceries, etc. You then pay $1800 for fun things (such as eating out, buying new clothes, etc., Netflix, games), and the final $1200 you put in your retirement fund or towards paying off debt. You do not go over your set budget for anything else. This allows you to save money, stops you from overspending on things you don't need, and helps you plan for the future by putting aside some extra money for prepping. This could be through learning new skills or buying extra items to be used in your stockpile."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Chapter Four: Getting Your Home Prepared Should the worst happen, and you are warned to, you should evacuate your home ASAP. Having a home prepared should never stop you from evacuating, especially if there is a danger of death. Staying at home is what preppers refer to as hunkering down. However , there are several occasions where evacuation is not an option. These include: Unable to leave due to small children, sick or elderly relatives Power outages Can't get safely out of the danger area in a short time When it comes to situations like these, and hunkering down is the only option you have, you must have a good supply of items that you will need, such as toilet roll, matches, candles, batteries, and drinking water , and food."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"How Much Do You Need? According to the Red Cross and FEMA, it is highly recommended that you have emergency supplies to last you at least 14 days. However , many preppers are much more comfortable having at least a month's worth of supplies at hand. For example, when Hurrican e Katrina hit Louisiana on the 29th of August 2005, large-scale supplies did not arrive until the 2nd of September – several days after the hurricane hit land. Hurricane Katrina was a devastating natural disaster , but it only affected a relatively small area compared to the rest of the country . As a result of blundering politicians, it took several days for supplies to reach New Orleans, even though millions of people worldwide sent aid to be distributed by convoys and helicopters. The world discovered that the government did not act fast enough. Hurricane Katrina was a localized disaster , and the people of New Orleans realized that the government could not be depended on to help immediately . What would have happened if the Katrina devastated area was much larger , or worse, the entire country? In those scenarios, it is possible that help in the way of medical aid, food, and clean drinking water, may not reach you for several weeks, possibly even months. After the 2010 earthquake that destroyed much of Haiti's infrastructure , the country still hasn't recovered, and the people went several months before any help reached them. Humans can only last three days before they die of thirst. Before that time, you may experience hallucinations, sickness, and many other symptoms. Having clean and safe drinking water should always be on the top of your prep list. You should aim for one gallon of water for each individu al per day. However , if you're used to using a lot of water, you'd ideally want to stockpile at least three gallons instead of one gallon per person. The best way of storing water is in barrels or jugs. You can store them in large plastic containers, but because they tend to leak after a while, you need to rotate them."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Also, you'll have to find a way to purify the water, such as with purification tablets or using filters. Another important factor to consider is that both these methods will not treat all issues. Although boiling water kills bacteria, it won't treat chemicals. You'll need to know how to treat various kinds of water threats. Although humans can go up to thirty days without food, having a source of nourishment is extremely important, although it is not the most important aspect you'll have to consider (having a heat source, particularly in winter, is much more important). However , having a good stockpile of food is a great cause of comfort in an emergency and something easy to deal with. Just cooking a hot meal can calm even the most frayed of nerves. However , establishing a good stockpile of food can be difficult if you don't know what you're doing. You'll need to think about such things as how many calories you need to consume each day, whether they meet your nutritional needs, how to cook them, how long they will last, when they will expire, and what will survive better in a disaster , and where you will store them. Gathering a good stockpile of food can be easy enough, depending on your needs and goals. If you want to make things easy on yourself, you must go to the supermarket and buy a certain number of days' worth of non-perish able food and goods. If you have the funds, there are pre-made emergency survival kits with 30 days' worth of food in them; some of these kits have been designed for those on a special diet or who have allergies. One of the biggest mistakes some people make is not thinking about how they will cook meals after a disaster hits. You may stockpile thirty bags of dried beans. They can last for years, but if you have no access to a cooker, how will you cook them when they take hours to prepare? How do you cook these beans or anything else for that matter? Many people find that as they start out on their prepping journey , they create their own bags of emergency food. Most of the time that means placing non-perishable food within sealed bags, some with"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"oxygen absorbers. It takes some time to learn how to do this successfully , but this type of method gives you the chance to decide what food you should stockpile and gives you more choices.

However , there are some essentials you will need. Water is absolutely necessary . Should a blizzard, severe storm, or tornado hit, it isn't uncommon for the water to be turned off in your home. You should ideally have one to three gallons of water per person daily. This will get you through cooking, cleaning, drinking, and maintaining your hygiene levels. When it comes to foods, you should keep a stockpile of dried fruits, lentils, cous cous, instant mashed potatoes, jellies/jams/ peanut butter, cracker s, cereals, oatmeal/porridge, baked beans, canned vegetables, canned fruits, canned fish, dried fish, etc."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Some foods you'll notice are not featured on the list, such as rice, pasta, and dried beans. This is because it takes a lot of time to cook these foods, especially the dried beans, despite soaking them for several hours before cooking . The pasta takes the least amount of time to cook, but it's still too long. If an emergency hits, you shouldn't count on having a power source to cook foods. You could use several methods to cook without an electric or gas-powered cooker , but they take a lot of energy to cook rice, beans, and pasta, and you will go through it fast. Also, you should remember that just because you can make a fire doesn't mean that it's safe to do so after an emergency . Gas leaks can occur after certain natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, flooding, and earthquakes. If you think you may have a gas leak, stay away from lighting any fires, despite how tempting it is."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Instead, stick to the types of foods that you do not have to cook. Canned items such as baked beans, tuna, and fruits are preferred because they tend to survive many disasters.

Instant mashed potatoes are a food source of carbs and can be made using dried milk or even water if nothing else is available. Cous cous is also good as it can be cooked within a few minutes. If you pre-soak red lentils, they also have a short cooking time."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Survival Foods for Long Term Disasters Hopefully , you will never have to experience a long-term disaster , but if you do, then you will want to be ready for them. In the case of a severe pandemic, a nuclear disaster , or an electromagnetic pulse disaster , you may find yourself hunkering down in your home for at least a month. When these events happen , you will need to adjust your dietary requirements. Y ou will require foods that: Can easily be stored within your home Won't get smashed or broken (such as glass jars) Can be cooked easily with minimum water and fuels Give you the nutrition you need and still be varied enough so that you and your family don't get bored with what you're eating Leaves a small amount of waste, so rubbish/junk doesn't pile up around your home. In the case of long-term foods, you will want to be able to freeze-dry as much of it as possible since they retain much of their taste and their nutrition. Canned goods are also ideal, as most can last for two years before expiring. Some organizations sell various specialty goods and kits, although they can be on the pricy side. Other items you should store water, as you will need it to clean, cook, prepare food, drink, and maintain a healthy environment.

Like freeze-dried fruits, you can eat them as is or use a little water to rehydrate them. They contain vitamins, fiber, and many other nutrients a healthy body needs. Seaweed has long been known for its nutritious values, although its name tends to put people off. However , you can freeze, dry, and cook it in various ways.

When it comes to situations like these, you need to prioritize calorie intake over anything else. Think carefully about the amount and types of food you bring.

They do not care about where you are, what you're doing, or how you feel. Most people are not prepared at all. But you don't have to be caught unprepared. You can take the necessary steps to ensure that you and your loved ones can and will survive whatever life throws. One of these things is stockpiling food for you to survive on. However , you are bound to make some mistakes along the way. Don't despair; you're not the first to make a mistake. Read on and discover some of the top mistakes first-time preppers make. You Don't Stockpile Enough Most people do not have enough food in the house to last them more than a few days, and most grocery stores are the same. When the COVID-19 pandemic happened, British supermarkets were sold out of their stocks within three days. Hundreds of thousands of British households couldn't purchase the goods they would normally buy for their families. Three days of food may be enough to see you through a minor snow blizzard, but if something else happens and the stores do not have enough food in, you will struggle to survive. Ideally, you should have enough food in your house to see you and your family through a minimum of thirty days without going to a store. This may seem hard to do if your property doesn't have a lot of room for you to stockpile. However , you can easily countera ct this by storing a few large sacks of rice and canned goods. Keeping It All in the Same Place If your home is destroyed, taken over by intruders, or there is a disaster when you're not at home, you may find yourself hunkering down somewhere else for a month or two. Because of this, you should keep a supply of food and other items somewhere other than your home. This could be in the trunk or back"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"of your car or at your place of work. It's doubtful that you would be able to get 30 days of food in these places, but every little helps. Another ideal place would be a family member's home where you could get to in cases of emergency . You Don't Rotate Y our Stockpile Dry and canned foods can last for many years, but this doesn't mean you should allow them to get old in the pantry. Adopt the First In, First Out method. You should use the items you first purchased and place the newer items at the back. Don't leave them to gather dust – use them and replace them. You Don't Store Them Properly You should store your stockpile in a safe, clean, dry, and cool place in your home. Mold can ruin foods if they contaminate them, especially rice, cereals, and pasta. Always ensure that your food is sealed so that they don't get ruined by insects and bacteria. Storing Drinking W ater in Dirty Bottles You will need between 30 and 90 gallons of clean water for thirty days. That is a lot of water! You need it not only to drink but to cook and prepare food and clean yourself and your surroundings. Therefore, you must store your water properly . You can use the gallon milk jugs, but first, you will need to clean and sanitize them before putting water in them. This way, they will not allow bacteria and mold to grow within them. Also, because plastic bottles are biodegradable, you will need to get rid of them every six to 12 months as they start leaking. Don't Forget about Any Medical or Nutritional Issues Just because there is a serious disaster doesn't mean that you should neglect your health or any nutritional needs you may have. It doesn't matter if you're not picking out scraps from a dumpster or trying to wrestle with a raccoon for a piece of fruit you found; you still have to look after your body if you want it to keep going.

If a disaster strikes and everyone knows you have a massive stockpile of food and fuel, they will immediately go to your house. Desperate people do desperate things in desperate times. Be careful who you tell. You Don't Keep Insects A way Imagine it. You're stuck in your house for over a month, no grocery stores are open, or they have very few supplies to purchas e. So, you open your flour bag, scoop out some of it to make a pie, and suddenly you see little bugs in it! Disgusting! This is what could happen if you do not store your food correctly . Bugs and other pests are notorious for finding sneaky ways into bags and sacks and gorging on the food we need. Therefore, as you create your stockpile of food, you must ensure that it is safely stored so that flies, mothers, cockroaches, mice, rats, and other annoying pests can't get inside. You Rely Only on Y our Stockpile Your stockpile was created to get you through the worse of a disaster . Fingers crossed that when you do run into a disaster , it won't be longer than the thirty days you have stockpiled for, and you can return to normal life and head back to the supermarket. But what happens if the situation lasts longer than what your supplies are? You must consider all the worst-case scenarios. Don't think of it as paranoia – after all, some grocery stores had nothing to sell for several weeks after the breakout of COVID-19, while others were looted.

This can be quite daunting for some, especially for parents with young children who depend on them. However , you don't have to worry . There are dozens of ways you can cook food without any electricity . Some of these are quite primitive, while others are much more technologically advanced. You must have an emergency stove prepared before the power goes out. That way, you are prepared and more confident when looking at your unopened supply of beans, rice, and pasta. Some of the following cooking methods with no electricity are only practiced outside. It is also a good idea to have at least two ways of cooking withou t electricity if something happens, and you can't use that other method. Another good idea is to have one method for inside the home, such as a camping stove, and one for outside, such as a wood stove, when you have no more propane for the camping stove."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"C o o k i n g I n d o o r w i t h o u t A n y E l e c t r i c i t y Another factor you need to consider is that all these methods use fuel. When fuel burns, it releases carbon monoxide into the air. Unless you have good ventilation, especially in the winter, you risk carbon monoxide poisoning. You should always keep a fire extinguisher and a carbon monoxide alarm in the home. A . Gas Camping Stoves uses canisters of fuel such as isobutene, propane, and butane. Some can even use unleaded gasoline or multiple varieties of fuel. In long-term situations, you will need a camping stove connected to larger propane tanks since the small canisters are depleted quite quickly , especially if you're boiling water for drinking or cooking rice on them. B . Alcohol stoves use alcohol as fuel. There are pros and cons to using alcohol; it burns cleanly , but it can be harder to control the temperature of the flames, especially if you haven't had a lot of experience using it. However , many prefer them to gas stoves. You can use alcohol, pure methanol alcohol, and denatured alcohol. Some fuel-lined antifreeze is created with methanol alcohol, making them safe to use. Isopropanol, or rubbing"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"alcohol, works, but it must only be used outside since it doesn't burn quite as cleanly as the others. C . Canned heat is when you transform alcohol into a jelly-like substance that you can then burn as fuel. It's also called gelled fuel and can be difficult to maintain and control the heat level and flames. Canned heat is generally cheap to maintain and doesn't evapor ate like alcohol, making it easy to keep storing in the long run. D . The tuna can method surpris es many people, but it is a great heat and light source in an emergency . Open your can of tuna in oil and place three pieces of tissue over it. The oil will get absorbed into the paper, creating an air-tight seal. Light the paper – it should burn for around 25 minutes which you can then cook food on, although you will need a pot stand to place the food in since it will otherwise smother the flames. The flames will also cook the tuna within the can. E . The buddy burner is compara ble to the tuna can method. With this, you take an empty tuna can and place strips of cardboard just thinner than the tuna can's height. Roll them up and place them inside. Melt wax using a double boiler, such as candles or crayons (some people have used butter), and once melted, pour it within the tuna can. Leave a little of the cardboard sticking out at the top to act as a wick. When the wax is completely hard, then you can light it. Place a pot stand over it, cook your food over the flames, or simply use it as a light source. F . The hay box oven is a method of trapping heat. First, cook your pot of food on fire (either inside or outside), then place it within an insulated box, close it, and then insulate it with hay. It will take eight to twelve hours for your food to cook, which is great for items such as beans, rice, and stews and leaves you free to do other things. G . A tea light oven, better known as the HERC, or Home Emergency Radiant Cooking oven, is a great way of cooking"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"inside the home. One tea light by itself won't cook anything or boil water, but you place an enclosed pot on several tea lights, which allows the pot to trap heat inside and gradually cook the food within. It does take a long time to cook this way (you're looking at a minimum of eight hours), but it can be done if you don't have anything else to hand. Make sure you have something placed around the tea lights to direct the heat towards the pot's base. H . Wood fireplaces have been used for thousands of years and are a great way of cooking food. All you will need is a fireplace, something metal to put the food on like a spit or trivet, and a dripping pan if you're roasting foods directly over the fire. If you do, you'll notice a rancid smell due to the burning fat. Do not cook over gas fireplaces due to the increased risk of carbon monoxide poisoning. I . A combination gas and electric stove is the perfect choice if you are planning on gas or electricity shortages. These run on gas and electricity, so if the electricity is shut off, you can still use the gas part of the cooker . They are more popular in certain Eastern European countries but still can be found worldwide. J . A wood stove allows you to not only cook food but will heat your home as well if the power goes out. However , you will need to have a working flue attached to it, ensure it is cleaned regularly , and keep your wood pile fully stocked. The great thing about wood stoves is that when you use them, you get a lovely scent from the burning of the wood – certain woods give off different scents. A plus to them is that you will get in shape from chopping wood for it! Ensure that your flue is working and is cleaned and that you have a working carbon monoxide alarm in your home. K .

Do not use a BBQ grill inside the house since charcoal, in particular , emits large quantities of carbon monoxide. Only use them outside. B . Open fires are fun for all ages, especially when you're cooking food on one. However , if you're not used to this cooking method, it can be hard to do. The wind can blow the flames in all directions, either catching foliage on fire, blowing the flames on you, or even blowing the flames out. Flames are notoriously hard to control, and it's not unusual for the bottom of the rice pot to be blackened and burnt. The easiest way of cooking on an open flame is by placing a BBQ grill rack over the flames or by creating a stand where you can hang a pot over the flames."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"C . An easy way of cooking outside is through ember roasting. All you have to do is create a fire and allow it to burn down to embers. Place the food you want to cook in some aluminum or tin foil, and then bury it within the embers. The best types of food to cook this way are potatoes and corn. It takes a while for the food to cook this way , but it's well worth the wait. D . Solar cooking is where you trap heat from the sun. You can purchase a solar cooker or make one yourself, but it's similar to that of frying an egg in your car in hot places such as Arizona or Texas. E . Portable wood stoves are popular with campers and those who like to live off the grid. They trap heat within and create lots of flames without using much wood. Most have pot stands within them for people to cook on. F . Hobo stoves are primitive and easy stoves fashioned with tin cans and use twigs and small sticks for fuel. They were designed by homeless people who desperately needed a way to cook and keep themselves warm. They aren't the best way to cook food, but if you're in a pinch, then these basic designs could mean the dif ference between surviving and not. G . A Dutch Oven is a thick-walled cooking pot with a tight-fitting lid and is extremely heavy. All you have to do is place one on top of a fire or cover them with burning coals.

Earth ovens are essentially a pit with a burning fire within, although there are various methods for constructing them. For example, Native Americans would create a large hole, place hot stones in the center, and then use branches as a covering. Meat and vegetables would be placed on these branches, followed by a moist covering to produce steam. Lastly, a thick layer of dirt would be placed on top to keep the heat in. I .

The food"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"is cooked inside the box that is placed on a campfire through radiant energy . Reflector ovens require a lot of heat and energy , so you'll require large fires with consistent flames. J . Wick stoves are made up of a tank where you can hold some kind of fuel such as lamp oil, diesel, or kerosene, which is then drawn up by a wick to a platform that holds a food container such as a pot or saucepan. Many people commonly use them in developing or rural areas and can also be found in antique shops. Unfortunately , the only problem with wick stoves is that they require dirt fuels. It is highly recommended that wick stoves aren't used inside the home due to the severe risk of CO poisoning. K . Hexamine tablets, also called Esbit, are small tablets of solid fuel that emit a lot of energy without leaving any smoke or ash behind. They were invented in 1936 in Germany , and each tablet can be burned for 15 minutes at a time.

Many non-canners believe only gardeners do canning, but almost anything you find at the supermarket may be canned, including jams/jellies, meats, vegetables, fruits, sauces, soups, etc. If you really want to be prepared for any kind of disaster , then you definitely want to ensure you know how to can. Dehydrating foods can be easier if you don't know what you're doing or if you don't have a lot of free time outside of work or family commitments. However , should the worst happen, your family will appreciate having a wide variety of foods to consume if you can't get to the supermarket – or if there isn't a supermarket.

Different foods require different preservation methods, so you must learn how to do both, so you will always know what to do, especially when you don't want to waste food or can't af ford food. The water canning method tends to be easier and better for those who have never done it before since it doesn't require you to go out and buy special equipment. However , you should have a fully stocked water canning kit before getting started since the equipment that comes with them makes the entire process much quicker and smoother than without. Pressure canning, however , tends to be more daunting for first-time users since it requires more specialized equipment. In fact, pressure canning equipment looks similar to that of a pressure cooker , although the two shouldn't be confused. Do not feel scared if you feel overwhelmed by these methods or the required equipment. Both are pretty simple methods but are also effective ways of ensuring the health and survival of your family . You will need to can foods with low levels of acids within a pressure canning, while water cannin g is ideal for most fruits and pickled items. Pressure canning permits you to get to high temperatures, which gives you a much larger range of items you can preserve in cans. On the other hand, in water canning, you will need to ensure you are using high acidic foods to preserve them at low temperatures. For example, suppose you're preserving corn with vinega r brine. In that case, the acidic pH levels of the vinegar allow you to preserve the corn at a lower temperature instead of using the pressure canning method. However , if you wish to use water instead of vinegar , you require a pressure canner ."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Pressure canners are ideal for sauces, stocks, stews, soups, and most other items."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"How to Can Step by Step Both water and pressure canning have remarkably similar steps for preparing and preserving. They tend to come with a wide range of recipes that can be used. Continue reading to learn the similar steps that both methods use. Step One. Choose the recipe that you want to use. It could be preserving vegetables, jams/jellies, or pickling eggs – it doesn't really matter as long as you and your family will enjoy it. There is a wide range of cookbooks and websites with hundreds of thousands of recipes you can use. Step Two. Now is the time to start preparing your jars and the canning pot. Even if you have just brought your jars, you must ensure they're thoroughly cleaned and dried before using them. After this, position your rack at the bottom of your canning pot. Your jars will need to be set on top of this rack. Add water to your jars and the pot – you will need to use a lot of water for this step because the water will need to boil and sterilize the jars, keeping them at the optimal temperatures to can. Complete the other steps as you wait for the water to boil. Step Three. The lids of your jars – but not the rings – should be warm enough to create the best seals. Place the lids in a saucepan, fill them with water, and then set them on the stove at a low temperature. Keep them in here until it is time to use them. Step Four. Start preparing the foods you want to use. Once completed, take the jars out of the boiling water within the pot and then slowly pour the water back inside the pot. Pour the food into the jar, making sure you leave enough room between the food and the top – the exact amount will vary depending on the recipes you use, but most of the time, it's about a quarter of an inch to an inch. This is vital because the jar needs to have enough space to get a secure seal. Twist the lid on, wipe it clean, and then place the lid's ring on it. After this, put the jar back into the pot, where the water continues to boil."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Step Five. Now you need to cook the food jar in the pot for however long the recipe requires. After the specified amount of time has finished, carefully remove the jars from the boiling water. Place the jars on a protected surface. If the process has been successful, you will hear a pinging sound from the jar's lids as soon as you take them away from the heat source. This indicates that the vacuuming seal has been successful. Step Six. Even if you did hear the pinging sound, you should always check. After all, there is nothing worse than being stuck in a house you can't leave, and when you open a jar of food, the process hasn't been successf ul, and now you have moldy food. Once the jars are cool enough to touch, you can untwist the lid rings to ensure that the seals are locked. Step Seven. After your jars are cooled and inspected, you should wash them to ensure no residue is left on them. You can then store the jars anywhere in a cool, clean space where they will be safe to eat for up to a year , sometimes even longer . If any cans did not seal properly, don't waste them.

Place them in a large saucepan with the juice of one lemon and two cups of apple juice. Bring to a boil and then simmer until the apples soften. After this, take the saucepan off the stove and add three tablespoons of pectin, one teaspoon of ground cinnamon, one teaspoon of nutmeg, and half a cup of raisins. Stir the mixture well, then place the saucepan on the stove. Bring to a boil for five minutes before moving from the heat. Stir in one to one and a half cups of sugar. Pour the apple jam into a jar. You will need to leave a quarter of an inch space between the food and the lid of the jar. Position the jar within a boiling water canner for ten minutes. After this, take the jar out and leave it to cool. Pickled Green Beans Place three pounds of yellow or green wax beans in six jars. Crush six garlic cloves, chop up six dill sprigs, and evenly distribute them between the jars. Mix three and three-quarters cups of vinegar , three and three-quarters cups of water, and one-third of a cup of pickling salt together and pour it into the jars, ensuring you cover all the beans but leave the same amount of space between the liquid and the jar lid. Ensure there are no air bubbles on the beans. After the lid has been sealed, place it within a water bath canner for ten minutes. Afterward, remove the jars and allow them to cool to room temperature. Beef Stock Pour eight cups of water into a saucepan with four pounds of beef bones and a little meat.

The stock should be allowed to cool. When a layer of fat covers the surface, scoop the fat out. Before placing the stock into your canning jars, you should heat it up again first. Pour the stock into your jars, ensuring there is a one-inch gap between it and the lid of the jar. After sealing the lid, put the jar into your pressure canner. If you're using quart jars, you will need to use ten pounds of pressure for twenty-five minutes or ten minutes for pint jars. Afterward, take the jars out and allow them to cool."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Unsafe Canning Methods You may hear a variety of things other people or their grandmothers used that are not safe. Some claim that a fifty-year-old steam canner their grandpare nts used is more effective than a modern-day water or pressure canner . Many people do not understand what issues arise when using a water canner to preserve corn and beans, using an oven or dishwasher to seal jars, or even trying to cook meat and other foods in the microwave before sealing in jars. Understanding and stressing this one thing is important – these are all UNSAFE methods. It doesn't matter if no one has died in your family from eating foods sealed in a dishwasher; it is still unsafe. After all, we know that cigarettes cause lung cancer , but some smokers live well into their eighties and nineties, dying from other causes. Just because your child hasn't been killed by a car while playing in the middle of the road doesn't mean it's safe to play there. When it comes to food, you need to ensure what you're consuming is safe. Not only for you but your family. There are universities and governments all around the world who claim the same thing – food poisoning kills. Also known as inversion canning, open kettle canning is the process of putting hot foods directly in a jar and then not using any heat to seal them. In your grandpa rent's days, this was how so many grannies would keep pickles and hot fruits, usually in jars that hadn't been sterilized first either. After placing it in the jars, they twist the ring on and place it upside down. As the jar cooled, it would seal the ring. However , because the food had been exposed to oxygen, it was exposed to bacteria before it was sealed. There was not enough heat to destroy any bacteria in the food or when airborne bacteria hit the exposed jar. Then the game of 'Who Will Get Sick First?' began. Some would get sick; some wouldn't. This is not a game you want to play with your health or your family's health, especially if you have young children or members with low immune levels. You need high levels of heat to ensure that any bacteria in your food is destroyed."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"The open kettle canning method is an outdated and unsafe method that uses no processing techniques. Steam canners, also known as atmosphere steam canners, are not recommended for low acid or acid-type foods. This method uses steam to process food without using pressure. It was said that this method saved you energy and time and used less water than water bath methods. It was designed to preserve jellies/jams, pickled items, and most foods. Steam canner s are often said to resemble a water canner turned upside down. A rack is placed on a base resembling a shallow pan and is then covered with a lid with a huge dome. Jars are positioned on the rack, and then a certain amount of water is poured into the base. The water is boiled, filling the dome with steam which heats the food and seals the lids. However , it should be noted that the process of cooking food in steam canners is very different from that of water bath canners. Clostridium botulinum bacteria can survive in low acid food products even when placed in steam canners and then poison the food, thus creating botulism outbreaks . Acidic foods are left unprocessed, resulting in the possibility of spoilage. Recent studies have shown that steam canners do not produce high temperatures at the beginning and end of the procedure compared to other methods such as pressure and water canning, thus resulting in the growth of potentially dangerous bacteria and poisoning. Micro-Dome Food Preservers were once a popular food preservation method in North America. However , in 1987, there was a massive recall of the products due to significant health and safety concerns. It is highly recommended that you do not consume food that has been processed using a micro-dome food preserver . Solar canning is where heat is trapped in a metal-lin ed box to process acid food such as a fruit. While many people swear that this is safe (after all, their grannies used to do it this way back in the olden days), it is highly recommended that you do not use solar"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"canning for any foods, including fruit. This is because the method isn't reliable enough to process any foods. Using ovens to canned food items is definitely not recommended due to the extreme dangers of doing so. It consists of sealing jars within the oven and heating them. However , there are several dangers you need to be aware of. First, you can't heat any food to the point of boiling temperat ure, so it does not kill all the bacteria within the food, including clostridium botulinum. As a result, the food spoils when stored and can be poisonous if consumed. Also, the cans or jars aren't suitable for the oven since the heat is dry and strong and can even cause the containers to explode inside. The temperature isn't enough to seal modern-day canning lids, thus allowing airborne bacteria to get inside and spoil the food. If an oven isn't enough to be a safe method of canning, then a microwave certainly isn't. You should never use a microwave to can food items. Although food can reach a temperature of 212 degrees Fahrenheit, the temperature isn't the same throughout the food itself. Just like the oven method, you run the likely danger of having your can or jar exploding either as you're heating it or as soon as you take it out of the microwave. Not exactly something you want to deal with. The Dishwasher method is an extremely dangerous method of canning food. People assume that the dishwasher's heat when it is on a cycle is sufficient to heat the food and seal the lids. However , this couldn't be further from the truth. The temperatures never rise high enough to kill off any of the bacteria inside the food, leaving you with potentially dangerous and under-processed food to consume later. It is perfectly fine to sanitize and clean your empty jars in the dishwasher , just not to process the contents of the jars. Salicylic acid or aspirin powders should never be used to preserve food. Some people use them as preservation powders and fail to heat the food sufficiently . About fifty years ago, it was common for people to place corn or other items into a jar full of boiling water , then add Salicylic acid or aspirin powers purchased from the chemist, and finally seal the lids with no additional process. Studies at universities such as the University of Illinois do not recommend these for any"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"canning method since they cannot raise the acidity in foods high enough to be safely canned . In water bath canning methods, you must add vinegar , lemon juice, or something with high acid levels to safely process.

Around fifty years ago, it was a common technique to use wax or paraffin to seal jars containing jellies, preserves, and jams. However , studies have shown that wax and paraffin are unsafe since they are havens for mold.

They are perfectly fine for storing dry foods such as dried lentils, pasta, rice, cereals, and others. Years ago, porcelain-lined caps with zinc were popular but are now not recommen ded for canning use. Zinc and rubber rings are not reliable methods of sealing. Any item that you use in microwave canning should not be used since the heat does not destroy all the bacteria on the items themselves or within the food since the heat isn't consistent. Do not use a pressure saucepan since they do not heat the food thoroughly as they aren't consistent in maintaining an even temperature throughout."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Chapter Seven: Home Defense Insurance is a necessity of life.

Not everyone will be out to steal from you. However , in desperate times comes desperate measures. Hunger will make even the sanest person go crazy and do things they wouldn't normally do, especially if they have a family to feed. You need to be aware of the people who come near your home.

No, you wouldn't. Just think about it. Disaster has struck. The supermarket shelves lay empty. You've got a family at home, surviving on the stockpile and the skills you have amassed over the years. You suddenly hear a noise from outside. You go to the door and find an armed man ready to do whatever he needs to obtain your supplies. Are you going to let him? No, you're not.

You should always have a good defense strategy , not just for the good times but the bad ones. You first need to make a good defense strategy for each period – the good and bad times. When it is a good period (a time without any major disasters going on around you), then an intruder will search for weak areas of your home, usually when the time is at its quietest, and it is easy to gain access. They could pretend to be cleaners, repairmen, lawyers, electricians, or even dog walkers. They could be male or female. However , when things are going crazy, and law and order are just a distant memory , you can expect to see intruders working in small groups. They will have weapo ns, have tempers, be arrogant, and are also determined to do anything and everything to get what they want. None of these make for a good combination. So, what can you do when the going gets tough? Well, if you can't afford an underground bunker, there are several ways you can defend your home and your items and keep your family safe. You don't need to rely on guns and ammo – you need to use your brain and learn how to use the three P's - prevent, pause, and protect. There are some fantastic resources on YouTube with veteran Marines, cops, and former military personnel teaching you how to protect your home, family, and contents from various scenarios.

This is because many of us go on holiday or vacation during this time. After all, it's usually when kids are not at school, and the weather is good. Criminals are well aware of this and will use it to their advantage . The least likely time to experience a burglary is in February – most of us are still recovering from winter bills and paying for Christmas, the children are attending school, and we have used up all our holiday time at work. Criminals know the signs that you've gone away. They include not answering when they ring the doorbell, no lights are coming on in the home, the curtains are not drawn at night (or are drawn during the day and night), vehicles missing from the driveway , the mailbox filled with mail, and newspapers piling up on the doorstep. So, what can you do? First, don't tell everyone that you're going to be away on holiday or a business trip. Tell a neighbor that you'll be out of town for that time, but only if you trust them or need them to feed your cat/fish or water the plants. You should also keep your car in your drivewa y or the front of your home. If you can't, ask a friend or neighbor to park there to make it seem you are home. Have a friend or neighbor collect your mail and pick up any newspapers from your doorstep. If you have a pet, arrange for a pet sitter to come in and stay to look after them. If you have trustworthy neighbors, tell them that you're going away and could they keep an eye out for any trouble. The home's weakest point tends to be the garage, even if it's locked. When you start to feel comfortable, you start becomi ng lazy. It happens to the best of us – you drive home after a long day of being at work, you park in the garage, and you forget to put the door down, or you put it down, but you forget to lock it behind you.

Even if they are locked, they can still use a weapon, a bat, or brick to smash them open. The best defensive thing you can do in this situation is to use clear safety film for your windows. Another easy entry point for criminals is your front door. It doesn't matter if it's locked or not; it only takes a small thin piece of plastic like a credit card to get the average door open. If your criminal has a set of lockpicks, it can take them only seconds to gain access. Failing that, a short, sharp, hard kick can also do the job. Most criminals will access your home using the back door since most police will come to your front door. Sliding doors, also known as French doors, are great for criminals since most people forget to lock them at night or when they go out. In addition, they are usually incredibly quiet things. You can stop criminals by putting wooden rods at the sliders. French doors tend to be weak, and criminals will break the glass if they believe the risks are worth the rewards. When disaster strikes and criminals are taking risks, they will most likely gain entry to your home via the kitchen – after all, this is where the food and weapons (kitchen knives) are to be found.

First, if someone comes through all your defenses and only finds a few tins of peaches or soup, they'll take those and leave. Have only a few tins or jars in a likely space. The intruder will think you've fought to save them all this time. When they take them, they most likely won't return since they believe you have nothing else. Make sure your main stockpile is kept well out of sight for this to work. Another good tactic is hiding. If a group of armed intruders makes their way into your home, have a safe place where you can hide. Most people who prep for such events ensure they have safe hiding places such as a panic room or a bunker underground. Underground bunkers can cost a lot of money to build, but safe rooms are less expensive. It doesn't cost much money to help build a secret passage to a room where you know you'll be safe, like a closet, an attic, or even a space betwee n the walls. If you hide, you don't have to confront an armed group of intruders from which you may be unable to protect yourself or your family. Just make sure you conceal the entrance using furniture, mirrors, or artwork. Secret tunnels are just as good as passageways.

Do Not Boast about Y our Stockpile Keep your tongue-tied when it comes to your stockpile. It is the first rule you must remember regarding prepping for any scenario. You need to keep what you are doing limited to yourself and trust members of your family. Only they should have access and knowledge of what items are within your stockpile, what weapons and defenses you have, the location of your stockpile, and the information on how it is accessible.

Just a simple total of how much you earn and then sort out your expenses into different categories such as transportation, food, bills, housing, medical, etc. Once you have done this, you can see whether you're spending too much money each month, whether it stays the same, or varies at different times of the year. This is great for when you're going onto the next step – budgeting. Developing a budget is a way of committing to your goals and hopes. You begin by writing down your income and set aside a certain amount as a salary for yourse lf. This money goes towards paying off"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"debts, buying things you need, or investing in equipment and skills to achieve your goal – living of f the grid. You take the remaining money and divide it to put towards other things. If you don't have enough to cover everything, then you need to start making some hard decisions. Could you get a cheaper place? Could you cut down on the number of times you eat out? Are you buying more food than you need? Do you really need to put the thermostat up instead of putting on a sweater or wrappin g yourself up in a blanket? What you should be taking from this step is how to live within your means and ensure that you save rather than spend money on things you don't need. You need to pay yourself first because that is your investment for the future. Cutting Out the Amount of Money Y ou Spend by Downsizing The most important thing about changing your life is having to accept a little humility and discovering ways to cut down on the amount of money you spend to save to live off the grid. Rent or mortgages tend to be what you spend the most money on each month. Why not move to a smaller property that costs less and put that extra money aside? Cut down on your forms of entertainment. Share a car instead of owning two. Learn to love the simple things at home. If you have too expensive, cut it out of your life. It can really be as simple as that. Saving Funds Keep an eye on what is going in and out of your bank accounts. Set yourself a goal – you can go off the grid when you have a certain amount (which you determine). That is your bottom line. When you save, you're not just talking about money . It also includes the material and equipment you will be using and the skills to use them. Find a list of things you'll need and search for them through garage sales, eBay, Craigslist, etc. You could even try your hand at making them. The more creative you are in sourcing the low-cost items you need, the quicker you'll be able to live the life you want. Taking the Second Step – Amassing Handy Skills"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"As you prepare the land and/or work out your budget, you can take the next step – learning new skills. You're going to need a variety of skills to help you through the good times and the bad times. Some of the skills recommended include hunting, foraging, woodcutting, mechanical and electrical skills, farming, gardening, cooking, and canning. There is a wealth of information dedicated to each of these and more. Classes are taught in colleges, universities, schools , and other places that anyone can turn up and enjoy. Also, YouTube and the internet are full of handy videos and online tutorials that not only help you learn these new skills but can actually be motivating and intriguing. It's surprising how many resources there are out there. Even if you haven't made that transition to off-grid living, you need to start practicing these new skills as much as possible. The best place to start is learning to can, which can benefit your family immediately . If you buy in bulk, particularly from local food producers, it is incredibly cheap compared to getting them at the supermarket. Why not hire a local field guide for a few hours and have them guide you through your local woods? They can show you how to identify foods that are safe for eating and which ones could possibly make you sick. There are books you can buy for cheap or rented from your local library if you want to try them yourself. Take what you find back home and share it with your family and friends. Taking the Third Step – Finding the Right Land One of the biggest hurdles you will face is finding the right land for off-grid living. First, you need to determine how much land you can afford or how much of a deposit you can put down. You need to consider the budget you have made previously and see how long it will take for you to save up. What funds you have available will determine what is available. Another thing to consider is whether you will continue to work your normal job as you transition off the grid. There are various programs and loans to purchase land for the express purpose of living off the grid. You should look into those before signing on any dotted line."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Lastly, where do you want to live? Think about your current location – is that the town you still want to stay in? Would you consider moving hundre ds or even thousands of miles away? Moving to another state or province is a big step, but if the land is cheaper , will it be worth it?"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Problems You May Run into Living off the Grid As with anything you do in life, you're bound to make some mistakes. After all, you're only human. However , before you purchase anything, you should try to learn about the various mistakes others have made so that you don't do the same. Road Access in the Colder Months During the winter, the weather can drastically affect your life. Flash floods, mudslides, snow blizzards, and many others can block your road access, which means you won't be able to get in and out. You should thoroug hly research the weather conditions in the area in the winter to see what kind of problems you could face. Accessing W ater You should also find out if there are any rights to water on the property you are considering buying or if you can get any water rights. Many times, owners have purchased a piece of land with water on it only to discover they legally cannot use it. (This is quite common in Mississippi, USA). If you are planning to construct one or more wells, then you should take the time to do the necessary research with local builders. How long will it take, and how much will it cost? How deep does it have to go? Since this can be expensive, you will need to ensure it doesn't exceed your budget. Zoning Restrictions Just because you have land doesn't necessarily mean you have the right to do what you intended to buy it for. It's actually more common than you think. Ensure that you are legally allowed to build a home or farm on the property , or you may find your dreams over before they've even begun. The Land Slopes to the South Land tends to be cheaper to purchase if the property sits on a south- facing slope. This is because it makes it harder to install solar panels and create productive gardens. West and east-facing slopes also"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"cause severe limitations. Do your research and make sure you won't run into these issues. Vulnerable to Natural Disasters So, you have found the perfect plot of land and desperately want to sign on the dotted line. However, before you do, you should ask whether the property is susceptible to natural disasters. Is there a history of flash floods, forest fires, landslides, hurricanes, tornados, or even tsunamis in that area? You cannot stop Mother Nature, but you can ensure that you are prepared for whatever she may throw your way . Is It Vulnerable to Urban Development? It is a fact of life that cities are expanding more and more into the countryside. Greedy developers purchase cheap land to build new properties and other building s to fuel their need for more money . Many people who have purchased land to live of f the grid have found that new housing estates surround them. This forces restrictions on your land. Before you purchase, search county records, and look up the development plans of what the city is planning. This gives you an idea of what you could expect in the future. You Don't Look for Cheaper Land Much of the cheapest land won't actually be found on the market or advertised with your local real estate agency . There are websites dedicated to land purchase only; if you've located a place where you want to be, there are locals who will know the right connections."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Closing on the Deal Once you have located the land you want, the next step is to make your offer. Most of the time, this can easily be done with an estate agent who will handle all the paperwork for you. However , make sure you have an experienced and qualified lawyer to ensure that the contract for the property is sound. Taking the Fourth Step – Developing Y our Source of W ater After you have purchased your land and it's legally yours, the next step is to ensure you have a reliable and safe water source. Without water, you won't be very successful living off the grid, especially considering importing water can be extremely expensive. You can choose from various options for the long term, but have a reliable semi-p ermanent water source ready as soon as you move in to make the transition simpler and enjoyable. Think about how much water you plan to use. This doesn't just mean how much water you drink, but what you need for cooking, bathing, and for toilets, cleaning, and irrigation water . Place each of these in separate columns and see if you can recycle water from one column to another or even use a dif ferent source. For example, you could supplement rainwater collected in barrels to irrigate your garden and fields but use water from a well for drinking and cooking. Another thing to consider is how you will purify your water and how much of it you will need. You may need to increase how much you use if your family increases, your livestock increases, etc. Identify the types of water sources found on your land. This could be wells, springs , ponds, etc., and find out with local officials to determine what you're permitted to use and how much. This can help you determine what additional water sources you may need to implement. Your next step is to start developing your water transpo rt system. Think about where your water is located. Where do you want it to be diverted to? Your water needs could be influential in how you design"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"your home. In addition, you will need to figure out the changes to elevation on the land. For example, if the location of where you need the water to get to is lower than your actual water source, you could decide to use a gravity feed system where you don't need a pump. These are popular for agricultural needs when living off the grid. However , if you need to transport your water up a slope, then you will need to install pumps. Additional choices you could make include carrying it by hand or creating irrigation ditches. Another thing to consider is how the seasons affect your water transportation. Every part of the world has a rainy season, where the rivers, streams , and creeks can swell and burst. Make certain that your water source is available throughout all seasons. You will need to find alternatives if your water source is only accessible at certain times of the year. You could use cisterns or water tanks that can be purchased cheaply online or create your own water storage systems. When you're deciding on how much water you will need, you should ask yourself one question - how much water do you think you really need? The answer is to estimate how much water you would need to get you through the dry months when your normal water source is not accessible. Now add an extra twenty percent to be on the safe side. Taking the Fifth Step – Constructing the Home You Want to Live in Once you have everything else sorted, it is time to turn your attention to where you want to live. To survive off the grid, your home must be safe, well-designed, and efficient, as it will need to last you for the rest of your life. Therefore, it is essential to take the time to get the design and layout perfect so you don't make any mistakes that could set you back. First, work out what your budget is for your home. Unfortunately , money is going to be a big influence on your home. Work out how much you want to pay but also add a little extra for something that is affordable if it is your dream property , but you can't go over it for any"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"reason. Many things could take you over your budget – construction can be very expensive, even if you're doing it yourself; therefore, always add an extra twenty percent to your budget if something unanticipated crops up. You can use your own skills and labor to cut labor costs. Identify your skills – such as carpentry , electrical works, etc. – and work on your home with professionals. Y ou'll keep your costs down considerably . However , if you don't have much experience in construction and can't afford to hire a builder , then there are various easier choices. These include constructing a tiny home (which can be sold in DIY kits) or cob homes. Yurts are also popular as they are quite simple to put up. However , suppose you lack the time or have any kind of physical limitations to oversee or participate in the construction process. In that case, you will need to think realistically about what you need. Finding someo ne to build a natural home is quite tricky, whereas brick home constructions are much easier to find. Once you've decided what kind of home you want to build, your next step is to think about where you will stay as it's being constructed. Building a home not only takes money and materials but time. You should establish a nice, comfortable, and safe temporary residence to stay in as your home is being built. Your options include a camper van, a caravan , an RV, a quick-build wooden structure, a yurt, a tent, and many others. The best home is placed in the best spot. For example, if you're installing solar panels, you should position the front of the property to the south or southeast. Have some shady plants or trees that can cool your home in the summer but allow enough sunlight during autumn and winter. You don't want to put your new home in a place that will be af fected by runof fs during seasonal changes. Last but not least, you should position your home close to the places where you will need to spend a lot of time, such as garden s or where your animals will be living. If you intend to be working on your land a"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"lot of time, then you don't want your home to be set somewhere far away. If you're looking to keep construction costs down, then definitely take the time to see what materia ls you can buy cheaply or get for free. There are places where you can find them; all you need to do is a little bit of research. Request help from family and friends, especially if they have any experience or skills that could benefit you. Also, local professionals are a great source of information and could offer help and advice before you start. Consult them as quickly as possible if you're hiring a team since you can draw on their skills and experience. The last step in this section is to apply for the correct authorization. When constru cting any kind of structure on your land, you must ensure you have permission to do so. You may need official permits before you get started. When hiring builders, check to see if they can do this for you. Taking the Sixth Step – Sorting Out Y our Waste Management When you are living off the grid, you must plan on how you are going to manage your waste. Water waste and sewage could be incorporated within your home's design, and most renewable systems will need some incorporation into the property and the rest of the land. If you are constructing your own home, you should decide on the method of getting rid of waste before building work starts. Think about the following questions: will there just be you in the house? Will you be living with a partner, kids, or a group of strangers? How many people will need to go to the toilet? Do you want an indoor toilet or an outdoor one? These question s and many more will help you decide on what your plumping needs truly are. You may need to file permits for septic tanks before anything being installed. How many people you will have living on your property will affect how much capacity you require, and what type of people (partner , children, workers, strangers) will affect how much it could potentially"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"handle. You may decide to have a compost toilet for your needs and a flush toilet for those who come to visit. Outside toilets tend to be cheaper but are quite inconvenient. Some people have opted to go hybrid – indoor toilets for urine and outdoor toilets for excrement. These factors will all determine your choice. When you are ready to start building your waste management, you can choose from simple designs to something bigger and more intricate. It all comes down to your needs, what they could be in the future, and what your budget is. Maintenance is another factor to consider . As you use your waste management system, it wears. Over time, it will need maintenance to ensure it doesn't suddenly give up. Septic systems need to be plumbed every three to five years and checked yearly to avoid any issues. Compost toilets may need to be cleaned each week, subject to how much they are used. It is important, then, that you make a note of the date when your waste system should next be inspected. Unexpected problems tend to be messy and expensive otherwise. Taking the Seventh Step – Planning How to Heat and Cool Your Home One of the biggest energy uses in your home is how you heat and cool it. Because of this, you must pay attention and look into free or cheap ways to get this. Popular choice s of energy sources when you live off the grid include geothermal, micro-hydroelec tricity, wood (masonry ovens, wood stoves, etc.), propane fridges, solar power heaters, air conditioners, ice houses, swamp coolers, earth or root cellars, compos t, manure, etc. With a variety of heating, cooling, and cooking energy options, you will need to work out what is going to be the best option for you and your family . The best options are, of course, natural. These include solar panels, but there are simple options you can do to your home, known as"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"passive solar designs. You could allow for windows and eaves to flood the property with light in the winter but block it during the summer and use thermal mass to keep the temperature consistent during the day . Root or earth cellars are a fantastic way of using the earth as an energy source. A root cellar is an underground space where you store food. The earth preserves the food because the soil maintains the space above the freezing temperature, yet the moisture in the air stops fruits and vegetables from decaying as quickly as they would above ground. Other method s such as cob and earth bags are also extremely popular. In fact, many modern homes are now being designed underground, or at least partially underground, to assist in keeping the home's temperature cool. Greenhouses are also good for heating a home during the colder months. Insulation is an inexpensive but practical way of cooling and passively heating your home. Insulation is placed in the walls and roof of most homes, but if you double the amount that goes in, it saves you a lot of money and energy to heat and cool it. It can be difficult to determine precisely how much wood and other materials you will require to keep your off-the-grid home running comfortably without making some mistakes. You should double the amount of fuel, wood, or other energy sources you think you may need for the first winter and see how much you use. Keep a record of what you do use for the following year . After you've decided on how much fuel it could take to get you through winter, now is the time to build a storage place to keep it in. For most people, this consists of a wooden structure or a shed where you can keep your wood or fuel. Remember to keep your wood dry as it lasts longer and is more efficient. Any wooden shed you have should have two sides open for the wind to dry the wood out even further . Taking the Eighth Step – Utilizing Natural Sources of Power You don't need electricity to survive off the grid, although it definitely helps raise its quality. After all, it is good to be able to switch on a"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"lamp at night or power a fridge to keep your milk cold. You can install solar panels, wind turbines, or even micro- hydroelectricity to help power all your essentials. To calculate how much you require, you need to figure out your usage. There are various calculators online that can help you work this out. To determine what resource s you should use, look at the property location. If you're in a place with strong winds, go with a wind turbine. If you have sunshine-filled winters, then choose solar panels. Hydrop ower could be the best option if you have slopes with water. Or, if you are lucky enough, you could combine two or more options. After this comes designing a reliable energy system that your property can use all year round. Various resources online can take you through the process, step by step. After you've design ed it, start building it! Once the energy system has been completed, you will then need to figure out a plan to check and maintain it. Solar panels can last between ten and twenty years before they have to be replaced. Other methods require an annual check and balance. Will you be responsible for unclogging your hydro water system, or will you have someone else do it? Y ou will need to plan this all. Taking the Ninth Step – Establishing Y our Food Source Once you have all your utilities sorted, now is the time to think about growing food. This includes deciding what you want to grow, establishing good infrastructure, and where you want to put everything. How much food do you need to grow? How much food do you eat each week? It's normal for your tastes to change weekly, as does how much you consume. If you don't eat a lot of produce already , try eating more of it for a few weeks to calculate how much you get through. You can then calculate how much food in pounds you eat and then times it by fifty-two. Planning a garden farm is a fantastic way of sustaining yourself and your family throughout the year. What you can grow is down to you,"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"but you must factor in climate and soil types. If your soil hasn't been cultivated before starting your garden, you must make it productive. You can add cut grass, leaves, biochar , compost, and other items. After deciding where everythi ng will go, you need to start composting the earth and make it as healthy as possible. Healthy soil is productive soil! Establish beds and fences around your garden to keep pests out. After all, you don't want to put in hours of hard work only to create a feast for birds, rodents, and other creatures. The majority of gardens require irrigation. This could be from water gardens, where water flows through the garden naturally , or by watering it directly . There are several ways you can create a garden that doesn't require irrigation. The last part is to decide where to plant certain crops and what time of the year they need to be planted. This varies dependin g on what types of foods you want to eat. Taking the T enth Step – Bringing Home the Animals Having livestock can make all the difference in the success of living off the grid. Animals are good food sources, providing you with protein, dairy, and fats, along with useful materials, methods of food production, manure for composting, and getting rid of pests. What animals do you want to keep? Most people recommend only bringing in only one type of animal each year. This allows you to adapt to the new changes and modify your time, energy , and another system without finding it overwhelming. All animals have their pros. Chickens, for example, not only provide eggs and meat but eat bugs and scraps from the kitchen but also scratch the earth, thus raising its fertility (feathers can be used for stuffing pillows ). Cows increase the health of pastureland, eat grass, and provide milk and meat (cow skin can be turned into leather). Goats can eat brush and large clear patches of land and give you"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"milk and meat (goat fur can be spun into wool). Pigs root to clear land, eat scraps from the kitchen, and give you meat. Once you've decided on your animals, you will need to figure out where their home will be. You can create traditional fencing, barns, and coops for them. Also, how will they get from where they sleep to where they eat? You will probably need a variety of other items to look after your animals, such as portable fencing and portable coops and cages. You'll need a place to store these and all the feed. You should have enough feed to last your animals over winter . Animals, like crops, will need to be harvested. You will need to decide when you will do this and how. Will you do it yourself, or have a butcher come in and do it for you, or use a slaughterhouse? The final step is to bring your animals home. Taking the Eleventh Step – Stockpiling Food for W inter You've planted your crops; your animals are settled into their new home. Now it's time to start stockpiling for the colder months when the earth is resting. You will then need to conside r how much you need to eat, what you are growing, and when it needs to be harvested. You will use your winter reserves if you are not harvesting anything over the winter months. You may need to bring in extra food from outside to keep you and your family going over the winter . When you know how much food you're going to need, then you can decide on how and where you are going to store it. This could be an outside shed, a basement, pantries, or even a root or earth cellar . Root cellars are extremely popular . The temperature remains around 50 degrees Fahrenheit throughout the year due to the soil, and moisture in the air keeps vegetables from drying out. As a result, they are great for keeping your fruits and veggies for much longer. You can also keep all your canned and dried foods in there. You'll need a variety of equipment to help you can and preserve your produce. Have everything organized and good to go before you"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"harvest, making things a lot easier. You'll need things such as crocks, knives, cans, jars, lids and seals, water bath canners, pressure canners, tables, cooking pots, grinders, apple cores, and wooden crates for storage, and all the foods you want to preserve. You may want to stockpile the items that you can't produce. These could be things like salt, sugar, seasonings, rice, etc., but they can make life a lot easier and tastier off the grid. You can buy these things in bulk, including ten and fifty-pound bags, which makes them a lot cheaper in the long run. Having a decent stockpile of these items can be great for emergencies. Taking the T welfth Step – Becoming Part of a Community To ensure that you transiti on successfully into life off the grid, consider what would happen when a disaster , natural or man-made, befalls you. This could include forest fires, flooding, landslides, a hurricane, tornado, or maybe even a break-in. When this happens, who will you turn to? You should always have a plan for emergencies. Bug-out bags or emergency equipment can be true life savers if something terrible should happen and you are forced to flee your home. You will also have to consid er friends, family, and neighbors. You could knock on your nearest neighbor's door, introduce yourself, and ask what people do in the community in case of a fire or flood. You could even establish safety procedures or plans in case something does happen and establish yourself as part of the community . Also, a big part of living off the grid is not only about being free but having fun doing it. Make sure that it's not all work, work, work. Go out into your community and interact with others. Send out invitations to neighbors and the community to get to know each other. You could teach others about your lifestyle and perhaps get them involved, or maybe help your community by donating any extra food you've grown to those who may be experiencing hard times. It is important to be proud of what you've achieved – after all, it takes hard work, patience, and dedication to live off the grid. Giving back to the community is a great part of doing this. This could be in the"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"way of hosting lessons on growing, mentoring kids and adults, providing cuttings of plants or seeds for them to grow their own food, stopping greedy developers from grabbing the land, providing safe habitats for wildlife, and even helping restore natural habitat."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Conclusion Living off the grid isn't for everyone, but prepping surely is. Being prepared is essential in this day and age. After all, we live in a time where things have been good for so long that we are now experiencing the wheel's turn. Disasters affect everyone. We all live in areas where there are natural disasters. These could be tsunamis, flooding, forest fires, mudslides, avalanches, tornadoes, cyclones, hurricanes, blizzards, thunderstorms, droughts, earthquakes, volcano eruption s ... and many more. This doesn't include man-made disasters: relationship breakdowns, car breakdowns, wars, famine, pandemics, and waves of crime. These are just a few of the many things that can and do happen. Everyone experiences disasters. Some are big and affect millions, even billions, of people worldwide. Some are smaller , affecting only a city, a neighborhood, or just a single household. You will likely experience at least one of these during your life, just like everyone will. The only difference between you and others is that you can be prepared. Being prepared is not just a state of mind. It is being ready to survive anything that comes your way.
