employment in the outback will lessen the chance of jeopardising human life. There have been many cases where loss of life has resulted from a lack of foresight in to the problems involved. The WA Police Service in it’s mission to create a safer and more secure Western Australia provides a service which is responsive to community needs and is willing to act as a first point of call for safe outback travel. Members of the public are encouraged to discuss their trip plans and post notifications with local police. PRIOR PREPARATION & PLANNING There are a number of things to be considered before starting to pack for your trip, these are known colloquially as the ‘Rule of P’ and are linked to the premise that - Prior Preparation and Planning Prevents Poor Performance. Equipment Required The equipment you are taking must be serviceable and sufficient for the trip. Allow additional equipment if in doubt. Maps should cover the entire area of the trip. Radio Communications For close range communication between vehicles a citizen band UHF or VHF radio may be used, however for long-range radio communication a HF radio is essential, these can be hired from communications suppliers at reasonable ra tes. Whilst travelling in the outback it is good practice to set up a communication schedule w ith the Royal Flying Doctor Service and contact them daily advising them who you are and where you are. Satellite/Digital Telephone Communications It is now possible to ensure telephone communica tions in the outback with the introduction of a system of digital telephones that allow the user to call on his/her digital phone and be connected automatically to a satellite system with no time delay if in an area not covered by a digital network. This system has a saturati on system of satellites that download to ground stations and ensure instantaneous voice co mmunication with no time delay between sending and receiving. Terrain to be covered A map study should be done to ascertain – • Whether it is accessible by vehicle • Where the fuel and water sources are located • What is the best route • What alternate route could you use if necessary • What aids to navigation will you have • What positions of evacuation are available • Where are the local inhabitants"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 8 Use of Maps The Western Australian bush is very monotonous with very few landmarks and a lack of signposts on outback roads. Be wary of spoken directions as they can be misinterpreted and the wrong track easily taken. In the absence of an official map, try to obtain a rough map drawn on paper with as many landmarks as possible indicated showing the necessary distances. Mark your position on the map as you proceed so you can pinpoint your location at any given time. Do confirm your position at every opportunity. Weather Conditions The weather must be considered as many road conditions vary according to the local rainfall. You should be aware of the changes of season in the area of your trip, this will ensure that you are going at the best time of year. Check w ith police or local authorities after rain as many outback roads can be closed. Time allowance You should consider carefully the time and space you are allowing for your trip. Considerations should include - • When are you leaving? • How long will it take? • Where do you propose stopping to camp? • When will you arrive? • Have you allowed a safety margin in case of minor mishaps? Learn about the country You should learn as much about the country you ar e to travel, as possible. This will assist you if you have to survive in it. Things to study would be – • Dangerous animals and reptiles • Insects, flies and mosquitoes • Prickle bushes and any poisonous or discomfiting plants • Any edible wild foods and bush tucker • Available water sources • Caves, mine-workings, holes and local problems • Diseases to guard against Notifications Before leaving on a journey through remote ar eas always notify friends, relatives, station owners or police of the following information – 1. Estimated time of departure [ETD] 2. Proposed and alternate routes 3. Estimated time of arrival [ETA] Note: Don't forget to notify those concerned once you have safely completed the journey."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 9 VEHICLE SELECTION Selection of a suitable vehicle for safe outback travel will rely on the load that you are going to carry. As well as major items of fuel, food and water you may also be carrying camping equipment, cooking gear, vehicle spares, tools, recovery equipment, an extra spare tyre and passengers. If you choose to travel 'off road' you will need to be sure your vehicle can withstand the harsh and rugged conditions you will encounter. VEHICLE PREPARATION Your vehicle will not only be your means of tran sport but if you are travelling 'off road' it will be your home and of course your biggest aid to survival should something unforeseen happen to you. As such it must be in first class mechanical condition. If you are not a mechanic it is best to take the vehicle to one who specialises in this type of vehicle. Explain the nature of your trip and have them go over the vehicle from top to bottom. Short courses in vehicle maintenance are offered by most community, TAFE Colleges, etc. Roof Racks To carry the intended load you will probably need to install a roof rack. Buy only from a reputable manufacturer who specialises in your type of vehicle. Under Body Protection Plates These are considered necessary by some people fo r rocky creek crossings, etc. They can be a problem in spinifex country as after only a fe w kilometres' spinifex packs tightly under the plate and creates a definite fire hazard. Roo and Scrub Bars These are not essential items for off-road tr avel but they can be good value should you be unlucky enough to hit a kangaroo or other large animal. Spinifex Protection Some spinifex grows to a height of nearly 2m and the seeds can be drawn into the radiator. At least 3 layers of fibreglass wire netting shoul d be placed over the front of the vehicle. Fire Extinguishers It is good planning to carry at least 5 litres of wa ter in a plastic garden spray for spinifex and grass fires as well as an extinguisher suitable for electrical or fuel fires. Tyres It is important to discuss your tyres with your local tyre dealer before your trip. Ensure you have the right tyres for the task. Eight ply ra dials are recommended as a minimum for off-road use. Two spares plus an additional 2 tubes should be carried. Wheel Rims It is easier to change a tyre on a split rim than on a pressed safety rim or alloy rim so stick with the standard steel split rim if possible ot herwise a specially designed bead-breaker should be carried for removing tyres from rims and replacing them."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 10 Recovery Equipment A valuable accessory for getting out of bogs is th e exhaust jack. This is a blow-up heavy duty rubber/canvas bag which is placed under the ve hicle and inflated by connecting it to the exhaust pipe with the engine running. Its purpose is to jack up the vehicle on any surface. Winches Types of winches range from hand, electric or pow er take off. If you have a winch fitted to your vehicle make sure you know how to use it. Some simple safety rules include - • Always use a sling around an anchor point rather than forming a loop. • Never place your hands within 1m of the drum if the winch is operating. • Always leave six turns of cable on the drum. • Run the engine when using an electric winch. • Do not pull if the cable is more than 15º to either side. Dual Battery Systems When operating in the outback each battery s hould be used individually on a daily basis. When making camp for the night the appropriate drill should be used to ensure that the alternate battery is fully charged and will start the vehicle in the morning. The battery used for overnight use [refrigerator, etc.] may go flat. Fuel Long-range fuel tanks are an excellent idea but make sure yours is fitted in the approximate centre of the vehicle between the chassis rails. Use the rear tank first to equalise load. If you do not have a long-range tank then 20 litre jerry cans are an excellent method of carrying fuel. If you carry jerry cans make sure they are metal or designed to carry fuel and use tie wire on all caps to prevent spillage. Water Allow 4 to 5 litres of drinking water for each person per day while travelling. If you have a built in water tank fitted with an external tap it should be fitted with a tap guard and the tap itself lock-wired when moving. Emergency Pack Enough spare food, water and blankets should be included to allow for any unforeseen delays. Emergency rations should last at least three days on top of your planned trip. A three-day emergency pack for each person should consist of – • 6 ready to eat meals • 4 litres of water • Emergency blanket Vehicle Loading The loading of the vehicle is critical and the vehi cle's centre of gravity kept as low as possible always. Get in the habit of checking whenever you stop."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 11 VEHICLE AWARENESS The development of electronic [computer] engine management systems for modern diesel engines has forced a change in the way dies el 4WD owners operate their vehicles. The reservations a lot of people had with the de velopment of computer engine management systems in petrol-powered 4WD vehicles in the early 90’s were in most cases largely unfounded. What was required then and now with the modern diesel is driver education. Gone are the days when all a diesel 4WD owne r had to worry about with a water crossing was keeping the air intake out of the water. In e ffect these new generation 4WD diesels, because of the electronics, have to be treated like petrol-powered vehicl es. Contact your local dealer or 4WD service centre and have them point out the location of the vulnerable points [electronic] under the bonnet of the vehicle. Remember a clean engine is less likely to shor t out. To prevent condensation [a problem for any electrics] clean the engine bay when the engine is cold with low-pressure cold water. Once these vulnerable or sensitive components are located suitable precautions can be taken. The location of the main computer is usually unde r the seats or behind the front left or right inside kick panels, near your feet. A word of caution with these computer manage d 4WD’s for those who traditionally fit their own radios and other electrical accessories. Finding the nearest live wire or earth and connecting to it is fraught with danger. If the pick-up wire is part of the computer management hardware that carries signals and mixed voltages you could unknowingly cause expensive irreparable damage. Note: To prevent damage have any electrical accessories fitted by a professional. Jump-starting is no longer a matter of connecti ng any set of jumper leads between vehicles. Your leads should have a surge protector fitted to prevent a possible voltage spike which will damage most computers. Most 4WD vehicles with computer manageme nt systems will have an emergency limp home mode that comes into play when the engine management system has been adversely affected. Although the extent of operation will vary from vehicle to vehicle road speed will be limited and cruise control, traction control and other non-vital functions will be disabled. Visually, a dashboard-warning icon will be displayed telling you which system has been disabled. The benefits gained from computer engine ma nagement systems for diesels such as more power, better fuel economy and lower fuel emissi ons should not be jeopardised by a driver’s level of ability or lack of knowledge and understanding of the vehicles systems and components. As a new owner you should take the time to study the owners manual and consult with your dealer or 4WD service centre before you venture off road."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 12 VEHICLE CHECK LIST The following items should be checked at the end of each day. This procedure should be conducted as part of your everyday routine and should never be neglected. 1. Check engine drive belts 2. Check engine oil levels 3. Check coolant levels 4.

Your trip can be safer and free from costly damage to your vehicle by following these driving tips - • First of all find out the overhang distance of your vehicle. This is the distance from the front of your vehicle to the first point you s ee on the road in front of the vehicle. The point in front of the vehicle is calculated with you seated normally in the drivers seat. You will be surprised at how far this overhang distance extends to the front. • As the road is constantly changing you must learn to search ground quickly and make decisions on wheel placement early. • Lower your radio aerial to prevent damage or fit one with a spring base. • Search the ground in a rectangular pattern l ooking from the front as far out as possible on the drivers-side wheel track and then back in towards the vehicle along the passenger-side wheel track. • Identify and avoid any object that can da mage the tyres or under-body components of the vehicle such as stumps, sharp rocks, or deep potholes. At times it may be better to drive a wheel over a large rock rather than have the vehicle straddle it. By doing this you raise the vehicle’s differential gr ound clearance and you prevent possible under body damage by hitting rocks. Assist with this by learning the location of the front and rear differentials in relation to where you as the driver sit. • Remember where applicable to lock your free wheeling hubs or central differential. • It is a good idea to lower your tyre pre ssure to around 80% of your highway running pressure. This will give the tyres a little mo re flex and grip to mould over rocks and loose gravel rather than causing the wheel s to spin and lose traction, which would occur if the tyres were left at the hard highway running pressure. • When driving in soft or sandy conditions th e lowering of tyre pressures can prevent bogging. Tyres can be lowered to a minimum pr essure of 16psi in both split and safety rims. Tyres must be re-inflated immediately after traversing the obstacle, failure to do so will lead to tyre damage. • Where you are going up or down a steep hill al ways engage low range on the transfer case. For those vehicles that don’t have a low range capability be very careful to assess the terrain so that you may safely negotiate it. • For those auto transmission 4WD vehicles sel ect low range and lock the gear lever in low gear whenever descending a steep off-road track. • Drivers of manual 4WD vehicles should rememb er that depressing or riding the clutch off-road is fraught with danger. • If you stall or stop the vehicle on a descen t you can restart in low range with the vehicle in gear. Simply turn the key on and do not depress the clutch. Cover the brake pedal and be ready to apply brake pressure if the vehicle surges forward [common with fuel-injected vehicles]. This ensure s you are under control at all times with the engine running and gears engaged. Don’t ride the brakes but feather them as required to slow the rate of descent."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 15 OUTBACK TRAVEL CODE OF ETHICS Outback travellers should consider themselves caretakers of the land and ensure that their actions do not add to the degradation of the landscape. • Do make sure your vehicle is in sound m echanical condition and equipped with all necessary fuel, food, water and spares needed to complete the journey. • Do have the ability to communicate with th e outside world either by radio, satellite phone or global positioning system e-mail. • Do tell someone of your intentions. Notifi cation of your time of departure, intended route, campsites and estimated time of arri val at your destination may be posted at local police stations. • Do camp in designated campsites or in natural clearings if none are available. • Do observe fire restrictions, clear ar ound fire areas and extinguish all fires. • Don’t break or cut live branches from trees and shrubs for fires or campsites. • Don’t leave garbage in the bush. Carry garbage bags with you and remove your waste. • Do stay on existing tracks and endeavour not to create new tracks or short cuts. • Do clear fallen trees or logs if possible rather than driving around them. • Don’t camp near stock troughs or in water catchments. • Do carry maps, information on terrain, track and weather conditions, navigation equipment and set escape routes. • Don’t travel off-road at night. If you must travel at night use only 50% of the speed you would use during the day and do not attempt rocky ground, mud patches or deep water crossings. • Do know your vehicle controls so you know where they are in an emergency. • Do know the length and width of your vehicle for negotiating difficult terrain. • Don’t infringe on the privacy of aboriginal people or any settlement and be aware that permission must be obtained to cross aboriginal reserves and communities. • Don’t carry firearms on pastoral leases without permission from the lessees. • Travellers from outside Western Australia must obtain a temporary firearms permit from the nearest Police Station on entering the state."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 16 CHAPTER 2 Outback Survival Survival is best defined as simply staying aliv e. Generally speaking survival in the outback is a day-to-day proposition. Each day can be broken into two parts, ensuring that once the sun rises your efforts are directed to staying alive to see it set and vice versa once the sun sets to see it rise. The first rule of survival The first rule of survival is ‘don’t panic’. You must take stock of your situation. The survival mnemonic The survival mnemonic will assist you to avoid immediate panic. S Size up the situation. U Undue haste makes waste. R Remember where you are. V Vanquish fear and panic. I Improvise. V Value living. A Act like the locals. L Lean on your basic skills. BASIC REQUIREMENTS FOR SURVIVAL You will need four basic requirements to survive, they are - 1. Water 2. Shelter 3. Warmth 4. Food In general the priorities will be as listed, howev er, in some situations you may alter them to suit, for instance in the arid zone shelter may become number one priority if sufficient water is available. If you have taken the precauti on of notifying someone of where you are going and how long you intend to stay a search will no doubt be conducted to look for you if you are overdue. Your task will be to use the knowledge and skills you have to provide the four basic requirements to stay alive until found. Note: Prior planning and preparation prevents poor performance. "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 17 ACTIONS BY SURVIVORS While a survival situation will be a traumatic experience for most people the effect it will have will depend on circumstances. For instan ce a person suffering a vehicle breakdown in spring in the southwest region of Western Austra lia will have a different reaction to a person who suffers a similar breakdown in mid-summer in the Great Sandy Desert. Stress and Survivors Stress is defined simply as reaction to pressure. Stressors Events that cause stress are known as stressors, th e most important stressors affecting survival include heat, cold, thirst, hunger, fatigue , boredom, loneliness, fear and pain. Reactions To Stress There are natural reactions to stress that n eed to be recognised, expected and for which strategic interventions need to be implemented. These include fear, anxiety, anger, frustration and depression. Do not over-react and remember that too much stress leads to ‘distress’ resulting in anti-social behaviour, angry out bursts, difficulty making decisions, unwillingness to accept responsibility, an inability to get on with others and eventual withdrawal from the group. Initial Critical Reactions Recognise that you are in a survival situation a nd don’t be afraid to make an honest appraisal of the situation. Get your thoughts on track by employing the survival mnemonic and recognise any survival stressors that are pr esent. Overcome any attitude assumptions [S he’ll be right. It will never happen to me. If any thing does happen my instinct, faith and inner strength will get me through ] and adopt a positive attitude. Your life and the lives of others who are relying on you to do your share are at stake. Remember that your physical strength and emotional resources are at their strongest in the first three days of survival. Questions You Should Ask Yourself In A Survival Situation You should stay focussed on the basic requirements for survival and ask yourself – • How much water do I have and how will I procure more? • What shelter from the elements will I need? • What is the temperature range and will I need a fire for warmth? • How much food do I have and what food is available? Survival Situation Appreciations An appreciation is a logical process of reasoni ng, the object of which is to determine from factors both known or assumed, the best course of action to take in any given situation. The six elements to a survival situation appreciation are - 1. Review the situation. 2. Determine your aim. 3. List the factors affecting your survival. 4. Identify all courses open to you. 5. Select the best course of action. 6. Make a plan."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 18 SURVIVAL PLANS The Survival Plan is the final process by which you or the group have chosen to stay alive.

Du ring the period from 1983 to 1999 forty-three people have perished due to excessive heat, thirst and exposure. Many of these deaths occurred because the individuals did not carry out good survival techniques. The average person can expect to survive without water for three to five days [depending on the climate and what they try to do]. Some inst ances show individuals have perished within hours of becoming lost. You must conserve any water you have, includi ng that already in your body. Water is required to replace fluid that is lost, so by conserving body fluid you require less water intake. Time frame for survival There have been cases where, in an ambient te mperature of 38ºC survivors have stayed in the shade and followed good survival principles and survived for the following periods when in possession of the nominated amount of water. Th e table below is included to highlight the importance your actions may have on your time frame for survival. No water 1 litre 2 litres 5 litres 11 litres 3-5 days 5½ days 6 days 7 days 9 days How fluid is lost from the body Fluid is lost from the body by perspiring, br eathing, urinating, vomiting, crying and talking. Perspiring Perspiration is a mixture of salt and water with the amount of salt varying from person to person. It is a normal bodily process that has a cooling effect as moisture evaporates from the skin surface. A person resting in the shade when the temperature is 35ºC would lose about 2 litres of fluid in a 24-hour period. It is impor tant to keep activity down to a minimum and conserve existing body fluids as any rise in body temperature can see losses in excess of 1 litre of fluid per hour resulting in dehydration. Urinating Is also a normal bodily process and cannot be prevented. However, it should be held as long as possible to slow down this fluid loss from the body. On no account drink urine unless it has been distilled. You could apply it to the skin surface with a sponge, in the hope that it will reduce your body temperature. Vomiting Can generally be avoided by leaving bad or harmful food well alone. Crying Should also be avoided, but it may be difficult to convince a child of this. When to consume water in a survival situation You should always drink to replace fluids lo st from your body however if you are unable to locate or procure water and are limited to the water in your survival kit it should be consumed in small sips to replace some of the fluid lost to your system. This water will increase your time frame for survival by up to half a day."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 22 METHODS OF WATER PROCUREMENT Your first efforts in a survival situation should be directed towards establishing a good water supply. Initially you should look for ground water using the following methods. Creek beds Are easily discernible in dry areas because of the relatively green vegetation and taller trees following the course of the creek. Unless there ha s been recent rain in the area the creek bed will probably be quite dry. You may be luc ky enough to locate damp sand or mud at the bends of the creek or by digging in the creek bed at a likely spot. Water can be extracted from the damp sand or mud by soaking a rag in soil and wringing out the water into a container. Where to dig in creek beds for water Rock Formations If there is any water seepage from the ground, it is usually to be found near rock formations, where the country is rugged and undulating. It may also be found in some apparently dry areas. Rocky areas are ideal for rain catchment s. Rain soaks very quickly into the soil, whereas it can lie in pools on a rocky surface for some time. Salt Lakes After rain has fallen, the top 3mm of a salt lake is fresh water. It can be siphoned off by using a grass straw or tubing from your survival kit. Windmills These have been erected on most farms and sta tions throughout the state at such locations as wells, dams and soaks. These can be seen from a long distance and usually have animal tracks leading to them. Check the water at these mills has not gone salty. Animal Trails Animals need water the same as humans and th ey will travel great distances regularly each day, leaving trails to the water source. Where a large number of trails converge together, it would indicate that the water was not far distant. Water seepage Sometimes water can be found close to the surface in natural springs and soaks or at the base of cliffs and rock-piles where vegetation appears to be thriving."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 23 Tree Roots In the early morning before the heat of the day, the roots from trees such as the boab, kurrajong, wattle and some gums can be cut into short lengths, stood end-on with their thickest ends down in a container allowing the flui d to drain. It is best to use roots that are easily obtained with a minimum of effort. The id eal location for this is in creek beds and washouts where parts of the roots are already exposed or near the surface. Draining water from tree roots Certain Trees Some trees such as the boab, desert-oak, she-oa k and paperbark store water. Water will collect in the crevices of some of these trees after rain, in blisters under the bark in others such as the paperbark and in the sapwood under the bark of the boab. It is preferable to use a length of rubber tubi ng to siphon water from crevices and to extract the water from blisters and under bark by cu tting a ‘V’ through the bark and collecting the escaping water in a container. Note: Chewing the sapwood of trees is not recommended as it may aggravate thirst. Coastal Water Sources You can obtain drinking water by digging high up on the beach above the tidemark or behind the first sand hills. It tastes brackish and should only be used in small quantities. Dew The collection is tedious, but of some value in heavy grassland. Tie clumps of grass or cloth around ankles and walk around in dew-drenched gr ass at dusk or dawn. Squeeze moisture into a container and repeat. If you have a vehicle, wipe down the vehicle with a cloth and collect the dew in a container. You can also dig ‘dew holes’ and line them with plastic to collect the dew. Foliage Bags If there are no large trees in the area you can break up clumps of grass or small bushes and place them inside the bag, the same effect will take place as in transpiration. Make sure you follow the guidelines and provide a sump and remember to replace the foliage at regular intervals when water production is reduced."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 24 Transpiration Method Water can be obtained by placing a clear plastic bag over the leafy branch of a non-poisonous tree [taste-test the foliage] and securing the bag w ith tape at the end of the branch. Seal any holes with tape, band-aids, etc. The action of the sun on the plastic will cause water to be drawn from the leaves and run to the lowest part of the bag. Do not disturb the bag to collect the water, simply cut a small hole in the bag then reseal it. The leaves will continue to produce water as the roots draw it from the ground. The transpiration method The water should be drained off every two hours a nd stored. Tests indicate that if this is not done the leaves stop producing water. Probably th e heavy concentration of moisture-laden air reduces the effectiveness of the sun. Ensure these bags receive maximum sunshine at all times. Exposed roots can be tested for water c ontent prior to bagging the tree. Soft pulpy roots will yield the greatest amount of liquid for less effort. Note: A piece of cord can be tied around the bottom of the bag to form a sump and will stop sticks, leaves and insects from contaminati ng the water or blocking the tapping hole. It will also stop alkalines leaching from the foliage into the sump. The Desert Still Dig a hole approximately 1m x 1m x 60cm d eep, line the hole with non-poisonous vegetation and place a container in the centre with a piece of rubber tubing leading from the container out of the hole for use as a drinking straw. Cove r the hole with a clear plastic sheet and seal around the edges with soil from the hole. The plastic sheet should be weighted with a stone placed in the centre so it forms an inverted c one to allow condensed water to run into the centre on the underside of the plastic and drip into the container. The Desert Still Sump"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 25 The desert still method will work without the drinking straw, however to collect the water the edges of the plastic must be lifted allowing mois ture-laden air to escape. The foliage will need to be replaced when water production falls off. Care should be taken that the plastic sheet does not touch the foliage as this will preven t the condensed water from running into the container. Additional fluid such as salt water from salt lakes, urine, etc. can be added to the hole. Note: This method while efficient has the disadvantage of requiring a lot of effort and subsequent loss of fluid from the body th rough perspiration and therefore is not recommended in areas where the transpiration bag can be used. Distilling Sea Water If only salt water is available a distilling plant can be made. You will have to improvise and use containers that can be found or that you may have. First you require a container of seawater and material to seal the container to prevent steam from escaping. Push one end of the tubing or rubber hose through this seal materi al and check to see that the seal remains intact while blowing into the loose end of th e tubing. Place the container onto a fire and bring to the boil. Steam will be forced through the t ube where it condenses and fresh water will drip from the end, into another container. The condensation method of distilling water Another method is to simply bring water to th e boil and catch as much steam as possible on a piece of cloth and then ring it out. Although this method works, it is not the most efficient. You must remember that the steam is the fresh water and therefore you must trap the steam to get fresh water. Any improvised method will do even if you place an open container on the fire and bring it to the boil, and then arrange a small plastic ‘tent’ on top of it. The steam will strike the tent, condense and run down to your container or containers. Note: Alfoil or similar would make a seal around the container by folding it into a cone shape with the tubing attached to the small end of the cone and placing the large end around the container, secure ends of cone with wire to make the seal. Run the tubing through a cooling agent [water]."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 26 WATER PURIFICATION You must always ensure that the water you drink will not cause internal infection as this will lead to further loss of fluid. You must purify any natural water that you drink by using a water filtration device, adding sterilization tablets or by boiling it. Note: Salt water should never be drunk unless distilled. Clarification of water The water you drink should be as clear as possible. It can be left for twelve hours to settle or strained to remove the suspended matter. A good method of doing this is to make an improvised filter from the leg of a pair of trouser s or a shirtsleeve. Into this place fine sand up to one third the length of the filter, charcoal fo r the next third and fill to the top with gravel, small stones, etc. Hang the filter in a tree or si milar and pour in the muddy water. It will take a little time but clarified water will begin to seep through the filter and drip into a container placed underneath. Sterilisation of water Because the water is clear does not mean that it ha s no bacteria in it. To make sure of this you must sterilise any natural water that you drink. To sterilise water you can use several methods; the recommended method is to put in sterilisa tion tablets from your survival kit. The alternatives would be to boil the water or to use other chemicals that will neutralise any bacteria such as condies crystals or iodine from your first-aid kit. Portable Water Filters These are designed for the world’s diverse water conditions and usually combine a ceramic filter with activated carbon granules. Worldw ide studies have shown, that bacteria accumulates in every activated carbon filter, wh ich is why manufactures now put the ceramic filter after the carbon filter thus eliminating not only micro-organisms such as Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Salmonella, E-Coli and Cholera, but also chemicals such as chlorine and pesticides. Most units do not de-salinate salt water, you should check this with your supplier when purchasing. To operate the unit, the intake hose is suspended in the untreated water. The filter is held vertically and pumped until purified water begins to flow from the outlet. As bacteria and particles of dirt become trapped on the su rface of the ceramic filter pumping will require greater effort. The filter should then be cleaned and not forced."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 27 Shelter Extremes of heat and cold are the enemies of human survival and both these qualities are found in inland arid regions where very hot da ys can be followed by cold nights. During the period from 1983 to 1999 fifteen people died due to excessive heat and thirteen due to excessive cold in Western Australia. A shelter will provide you with protection from the elements, insects and animals. It is also a big psychological boost that will help you feel th at you are managing. Determine what type of shelter you require and plan accordingly. While building your shelter remember that k eeping in the shade and moving as little as possible in the heat of the day can avoid heat stroke and loss of body fluid. Using Vehicles as Shelter Vehicles are a source of shelter as they provi de protection from the sun, rain and prevailing weather during the day and the cold air at night. Tarpaulins, blankets or branches can be used to keep direct sun from the vehicle and inte rior linings, doors, boot lids and bonnets can also be removed. Foil Rescue Blanket Space and/or rescue blankets are cheap, lightwei ght and an ideal item to assist in providing shelter. The reflective surface reflects the sun's rays from the person sheltering underneath. Natural Shelter If nothing else is to hand you will have to use bush materials, when constructing a shelter you should consider the following points – • Type of protection required. • Availability of materials. • Proximity of water. • Close to your emergency signals. When you begin construction, use larger branches for your basic frame as you will find a roof fairly heavy when it is wet and they will have to support it. Branches can be tied together using vines, strips of bark or sword grass. If you are near your vehicle, strip out wires to use for this. Remember that your ability to improvise and s ee alternate uses for items that you may have available to you could mean the difference between life and death. TYPES OF SHELTERS Any survival situation will involve the constr uction of some form of shelter from the elements. The need for shelter and the type of shelter should be identified in your survival situation appreciation. It is important that you base a ny decision to build a shelter on your survival plan. Note: Be careful not to use items from your survival kit, which might have a higher priority of use."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 28 Building shelters Your shelter will depend largely on what is av ailable to use and what the conditions are. Common sense will guide you but be warned, a sh elter takes a good deal longer to build than one imagines. If you can find something that will provide a part of a shelter such as a hollow log, then use it as the basis of your shelter, this will save time and energy. Some fairly simple types of shelter, which you can build, with a minimum of effort include the following - The A-frame shelter The lean-to shelter The aboriginal shelter"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 29 Using a tarpaulin for shelter A tarpaulin can be a valuable aid to providing shelter from the elements as there is no limit to the uses it can be put to. Remember that tarp aulins today are fairly lightweight and may be dropped to you by rescue aircraft. In hot conditions it can be used solely as a ba se to protect from radiated ground heat when used in conjunction with any shelter designed to provide shade. Tarpaulins can also be used in hot conditions to provide deep-shade as the roof of a large A-frame shelter. In wet, windy conditions they can be used to pr ovide shelter using one end as a base and then using the remainder of the tarpaulin to provide an outer skin for waterproofing or simply using as a large A-frame with the edges pegged down or held in place using rocks or logs. Note: Tarpaulins need not be used on their own as shelter but can be utilised to supply additions and improvisations to other forms of shelter that you may decide to build. Roofing If your vehicle is handy, you can pull out the head lining to use to make a waterproof roof. If not, then blankets, sleeping bags or even spare clothes can be used. Thatching Waterproofing and shade can be provided usi ng a technique called thatching. This can be done by using materials such as palm fronds, leaf y branches, tufts of long grass, reeds, sedges and/or long stalked ferns. A good method to em ploy is called “tuft thatching” using long, pliable tufts of grass, reeds or sedges. These ar e better used when dry or partly dry as they will not shrink and fall apart in windy conditions. To make a “tuft thatch” – 1. Gather the material into small sheaves or handfuls. 2. Bend the end of each sheaf over a batten or long stick. 3. Twist a few strands of the material ar ound the sheaf a few times and push it through the bunched up material to hold the sheaf together. 4. Completed “tufts” are then slid along the batten to make a neat thatch. 5. Each completed batten is then lashed to th e frame to provide a wall or roof as required when used to overlap completed battens. Use Of Debris Once you have constructed the skeletal structur e for your shelter in cold or wet weather you should consider the use of debris for protec tion and insulation. Over the framework heap a pile of light, soft debris. Leaves, grasses, brush, or any type of leaf litter will do. The debris should eventually form a large dome shaped mound some 60cm thick over the structure. Remember the thicker the pile the be tter the insulation and the steeper the pitch the better the rain protection. On top of the debr is add some bark slabs or moss to form a protective waterproof layer and to assist in keeping it together. Low debris shelters built using this method are sometimes called “oven shelters”."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 30 Warmth In Western Australia in the period from 1983 to 1999, thirteen people died due to excessive cold. Many of these deaths could have been prevented had the individuals possessed the resources and skills to light a fire. FIRELIGHTING WITHOUT MATCHES Fire cooks, warms, sterilises and acts as a signal if necessary. To start a fire requires an understanding of combustion. For combustion to o ccur requires the presence of fuel, heat and oxygen. Fuel consists of dry vegetable matter, dry animal manure, reactive chemicals, kindling and timber. Heat can be provide d by friction, chemical reaction, spark or magnification. Remember that oxygen is the essen tial ingredient to produce flame from heat and fuel. Always carry some form of fire starter with you on trips such as waterproof matches or lighter. If you do not have these then your skills should include at least one of the following methods. Remember that traditional methods of fire lighting require a high degree of patience and skill and should be learned and practised in a training environment. Vehicle Method Your vehicle has probably been fitted with a ci garette lighter. Use this to ignite a petrol soaked rag [outside the car]. If you do not have a lighter then remove the battery from the vehicle, pull out two wires from the vehicle and attach these to the terminals of your battery and run them away to the ground. When the ends are touched together they will spark and ignite tinder. The battery method of fire lighting Note: The gas produced by a battery is highly volatile and if exposed to a spark could cause an explosion. Make sure the fire is started away from the battery. Torch Battery Method A fire can be started by holding very fine steel wool from your tool kit over the negative terminals of a 6-volt torch battery and brushing it against the positive terminal. The sparks produced should ignite the steel wool [make sure you have tinder ready]. Chemical Method Condies Crystals [carried in some survival and/or first aid kits] can be used to start a fire by mixing in equal amounts with sugar [barley sugar can be used] and grinding them with the flat of a knife blade. The result is a brief intense flame. Note: Make sure that you have tinder prepared and ready when lighting fires."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 31 The Fire - Bow Method This method is used by many indigenous people around the world. To use the fire-bow take a turn around the drill with the nyl on cord attached to the bow [if you have used green timber for a bow the tension will be applied automatically, otherwise use your fingers to hold it tight]. Place the tip of the drill into the base starting groove and hold the headstock onto the top of the drill. Push and pull the bow to rota te the drill. The over-heat ed shavings [punk] will fall through the groove in the base onto the tinder. The small ember, which will form, should be held in the tinder and blown until it ignites. The fire-bow method of fire lighting The Bow - can be any branch of a tree and should be approximately 45cm to 60cm. The Head Stock - is a piece of hardwood to hold the top of the drill and allow it to rotate. The Base - is a softer piece of dry wood flattene d top and bottom so it will sit on the ground to allow the drill to start. A small groove is cut in to the side of the base directly beside where the drill is to be used to allow the shavings or punk to fall onto the tinder. The Drill - consists of a piece of dr y wood of soft texture 30 - 40cm long and as straight as possible. The diameter should be 1.5cm to 2cm, the drill sharpened to a point at both ends to fit into the starting groove of both the base and head stock. Note: One of the better types of wood to use for both the drill and base is the lower wooden portion of the flower stalk from the balga plant. The Lens Method Strong sunlight focused through a lens can produ ce enough heat to ignite tinder. The lens can come from a magnifying glass [i ncluding the base of some compasses], binoculars, camera or telescopic sights from firearms. Flint, Steel and Magnesium Blocks Flint is a stone which if struck with a piece of steel [knife] produces sparks, which will ignite tinder. Magnesium blocks [flint attached] are av ailable commercially for inclusion in survival kits as emergency firelighters."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 32 Food LIVING OFF THE LAND Although food is not as important as the other th ree requirements for survival it is necessary for a prolonged survival situation. Any availabl e foods should be eaten sparingly, keeping in mind that it is better to have one meal a day than to nibble small amounts. The average healthy adult can live for several w eeks without food so this will give ample time to locate nourishment from natural sources if necessary. Food sources Sources of food available to survivors include; an imals, bird life, marine life, insects, grubs and plant life. In considering natural sources of food, there are some important points to remember • Most animals, bird and plant life are pr otected and should only be used for food sources in emergencies. Should it be nece ssary only kill what is needed for your survival. • The body needs fluid to digest food, so f oods with a high water content should be considered before others. If no water at a ll is available, then food should be avoided, particularly meat, which requires more fluid to digest than vegetation. • You do not need to be a skilled hunter to obtain food in the bush. Even without weapons of any description enough lizards, in sects and grubs can be found to keep a person alive for several days simply by looking under rocks and dead branches, tree stumps and anthills. • If possible all foods should be cleaned carefully by washing, then cooked, thus lessening the chances of any infection or stomach upsets. • Generally bush food is tough, fibrous, unpalata ble, and to some, even nauseating; nevertheless it is food. THE FOOD PREFERENTIAL Most people when forced to live off the land w ill find it easier to try to eat food that reminds them of their normal diet at home. For th is reason it is handy to know that our food preferences can be divided into three classes. These are – 1st Class marsupials - birds – fish – fowl 2nd Class reptiles 3rd Class vegetation - grubs – insects "},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 33 Animals and Reptiles The presence of any animal or bird life in an area is evident by tracks, droppings and traces of fur or feathers. If you have been lucky enough to find a waterhole used by animals it is a simple matter to sit under cover, down-wind from the water source and either shoot or snare the animals as they come to water. Even by walking through the bush quietly during the day it is possible to surprise sleeping animals in creek beds, under shady trees and amongst rocky outcrops. Some of the most likely animals seen in the bush include kangaroos, small marsupials, wild goats, donkeys, pigs, rabbits, snakes, lizards, frogs, sheep and cattle. Some imagination and bushcraft skills are need ed in knowing where to look, how to recognise tracks and how to snare the faster moving animals. SNARING ANIMALS Without a firearm or manufactured animal trap most animals can be snared with a wire noose placed in a convenient position such as the en trance to a hole or above an animal path between two trees. The noose should slide freely and the other end of the wire should be anchored securely to a tree or post. As the animal passes through, th e noose tightens around the neck quickly killing it as it tries to pull free. This type of trap is generally successful at night when the animal cannot see the snare. Care should be taken not to leave any human smell on the wire. Owing to the cruel nature of the snare, it should only be used when other methods fail. If setting a snare look for signs of fur around a tree's base or signs along a fence line to indicate where an animal has passed through. Anim als will return to the same place to sleep and will continue to negotiate fences at the same spot.

Bird Life Ground feeding birds can be trapped by placing gr ass or other bait under a cage made from wire netting or green sticks woven together. Th e cage is propped up with a stick that is pulled out by a hidden observer tugging a string as the bird walks under the cage. The cage falls, trapping the bird. The bird trap A fishing line can also be used successfully. Bait the hook with an insect, bread, or other edible matter; tie the line to a tree or stick where the birds frequent. Birds are rather difficult to shoot or trap becau se of their flighty nature but you may be lucky enough to locate a nest, either on the ground or in the trees, containing eggs or young. Most birds try to confuse intruders by flying aw ay from their nest at the approach of any danger. This has the effect of leading the in truder in the wrong direction, thus protecting the eggs or young. Emus are very common in outback areas and can be enticed towards bright objects waved by a person hiding behind a bush. As the bird's inqui sitive nature leads it w ithin metres of the object, the person can then step out and kill the bird with a suitable weapon. When shooting or trapping, frequent a water sour ce if possible. Stealth, not speed, is of great importance when shooting and patience at a water hole at dawn or dusk is usually rewarded."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 37 Reptiles All reptiles are edible including venomous snakes [remove the head and portion of the neck to remove the venom glands]. Goannas being reptiles are fatty and oily so if you have to eat these, overcook them. Remember, care must be taken when catching venomous snakes and other reptiles, as their bite can be fatal or lead to infection. Note: In the period from 1980 to 2001 nine deaths have been attributed to snakebite in Western Australia. Marine Life Fish are a valuable food source containing protein, vitamins and fats. All freshwater fish are edible. It takes skill to catch fish but by cons idering their feeding habits and following some simple methods you can be successful. Where to fish Fish frequent those places in the water where they are most comfortable and where they can feed. The ambient temperature of the area will affect these places. You should remember – • If it is hot and the water is low they will seek shaded water and deep pools. In lakes they will retreat to deep water. • In cold weather they will c hoose a shallow place where the sun warms the water and in lakes they will keep to the edges where the water is warmer. • If the river is in flood they will seek slack water generally on the inside of bends or in small tributaries feeding into the main stream where the water may not be so turbulent. • Fish and marine life like to shelter under banks or below rocks and submerged logs. The Forked Fishing Spear Fish can also be speared using a forked fishing spear. These are more effective than a single pointed spear at holding a speared fish and are made from a green sapling, split at one end and carved into two sharp prongs complete with in ward pointing barbs. Before carving separate the prongs with a wooden wedge then lash th e two prongs together using cord from your survival kit. After carving the spear can be hardened over a fire. The Forked Fishing Spear Tidal Fish Traps Fish can also be trapped near the water's edge by using a fence of upr ight sticks or rocks pushed into the sand close together and left in place. This type of fish trap is used by fishermen in tropical areas with extreme tides wh ere netting is used in place of the sticks. The fish are trapped by the mesh of sticks or rocks and easily removed when the tide goes out. Gathering Shellfish A method of gathering seafood on the coast is by digging in the sand or turning over rocks for shellfish at low tide. This is how some fishermen collect bait for line fishing."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 38 The Basket Trap Freshwater crustaceans [marron, et c] can be caught in simple basket traps baited with animal entrails or decayed meat and left in position. They should be fitted with a funnel at one end and tied together at the other. It is important they be weighted down, staked in position or tied to the bank to ensure they are still there when you check them. To make a basket trap – 1. Cut a bundle of green sticks 1m in length a nd 1cm in diameter and mark out a circle on the ground the size of the end of the trap. 2. Make holes in the ground around the circle with a stick every 4cm and stand a stick from your bundle in each hole. 3. Weave around the bottom of the trap three tim es with a long piece of thin green stick and tie off with cord to keep it together. 4. Tie the top of the trap together with a piece of cord to form a cone shape. 5. Weave a length of thin green stick around the trap basket fashion. 6. Make a smaller similar cone with the narrow end open and place it inverted inside the large cone to form a lid and entry. The Marron Snare A traditional method of catching marron is to tie a small piece of meat to a length of cord or fishing line and throw it a metre or two into th e water. In clear water you will see the marron coming to the meat. Once they take the meat they will hang on stubbornly and can be drawn to the edge of the water and lifted out onto th e bank. They can also be caught by using a pole with a running loop of snare wire tied to the end and placing it over the marron from behind and dragging them out of the water. Insects Insects and their larvae are often overlooked as a source of food even though they are widespread, a good source of nourishment, have a high food value, high fluid content and are easy to obtain. Fried termites and ant larvae for instance are a rich source of food. In some overseas countries, maggots, grasshoppers and termites form part of the natural diet. Termites can be obtained by picking them up on the end of a wet fingertip after breaking open anthills or dead wood. The taste of termites and ant eggs is not offensive. The insect larvae known as the bardy or witc hetty grub is obtained by breaking open dead trees and balga stumps after examining for the characteristic borer holes in the south-west and by digging up the surface roots of the Witchetty Bu sh [acacia kempeana] in the central desert area. They live on the dissolved sugars from th e sap of trees, are highly nutritious and are high in calcium. The entrails should be removed by holding the head in one hand and the tail in the other then pulling. Other insect larvae may also be present and can be eaten if there is no offensive smell or taste. Honey ants can be collected near the base and on the branches of trees in tropical areas. The fluid from their abdomens is good nourishment as is honey from wild bees if you are lucky enough to locate any. Note: Do not eat furry grubs or grubs with black showing through the skin and remember that while snails and slugs can be eaten they are an unlikely source of food as they favour wetter areas and there would probably be better alternate food available."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 39 ANIMAL BUTCHERY Most animals can be eaten although most of us have a preference for herbivorous animals such as cattle sheep, pigs, horses, rabbits and poultry. There is no reason however, that you cannot eat vermin in a survival situation. Signs Of Disease Check all animals for disease, the body should look well fed and be clean smelling. If in doubt a small piece of meat can be boiled in a covered pot, when the water is boiling if the vapours have a bad smell you should not eat the meat. Do not eat birds when the flesh is flabby, purpl e, a green discoloration around the neck, stiff feet, collapsed eyes or a sour smell present. If you can pull out a rabbit’s fur, if its eyes are enlarged and dull or its body cavity slimy it should not be eaten. PREPARATION & COOKING OF GAME The size and type of animal will determine your method of preparation for cooking. Large Animals Should have the throat cut to 'bleed' the car cass, hung up by the hind legs, the gut contents, head, and skin removed then cut into joints. In a survival situation meat can be c ooked by boiling, frying, grilli ng, baking or steaming depending on what resources are available. Kangaroo Kangaroo meat is very low in fat and very hi gh in protein and iron. B ecause of it’s low fat content it tends to dry out quickly and must be cooked carefully. Cook it quickly by grilling over an open fire as steaks or kebabs. Emu Emu meat is very low in fat and high in protei n, iron and vitamin C. It is red in colour and similar in texture to lean beef. The tenderness a nd texture of the meat en ables it to be prepared in many ways. It is best cut into thin steaks and lightly grilled over an open fire. Rabbits Should be skinned, gutted and have the head and feet removed. They are best cooked by inserting a green stick in the body cavity and turning them over hot coals. Snakes Should have the head, skin and stomach remove d and be cut into pieces. The meat is best grilled over hot coals. Lizards Are prepared simply by removing the head and gut contents. They are best grilled over hot coals with the skin left on. Birds Should be bled as soon as possible after death a nd have the head, feathers and the intestines removed. Birds can be cooked by wrapping them in foil from your survival kit, clay, large leaves or paperbark and placing them in the coals. Fish Fish should have the intestines removed and be cooked with the scales and skin on. They can be wrapped in foil from your survival kit, ba rk, leaves, mud or clay and cooked in coals. When cooked the flesh can be accessed by peeling away the wrapping and skin. Note: Remember to wash all meat of blood before cooking, make sure that you wash all blood and meat from your hands after handling dead animals."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 40 PRESERVING MEAT The most popular methods used to preserve m eat in a survival situation are by drying or smoking. It must be remembered that only fres h meat should be used to ensure protection against infection. Drying meat Drying meat is a good method for preserving it if you have more than you can eat immediately. It is also advantageous if it has to be eaten over a period while travelling on foot as the weight of the meat is reduced by approxi mately 70%. This is because the water content of the meat is removed in the drying process leaving behind the tissue containing protein and nutrients. Dried meat cut with the grain is known as ‘biltong’ and across the grain as ‘jerky’. The process for drying meat is – • Construct a simple tripod frame to hold the meat strips. • Cut the meat into thin strips and remove a ll fat and gristle as the fat will not dry and will encourage the growth of bacteria. The th inner the strips the faster water will be extracted. It is best to cut a small hole in one end of each strip of meat and pass a stick through the hole rather than folding the strips over the stick as this provides an area on the underside of the meat that will not dry and will harbour bacteria. • Hang the strips in a sunny, breezy spot for 2-3 days to sun-dry it or place it alongside a slow burning fire to smoke it until the meat goe s hard to the touch and dark in colour. When meat is smoked the smoke will solidify the protein content of the meat and stop decomposition and seal in any flavour. • When smoking meat do not let the fire produce flames and remember that the best way to produce smoke is to use sawdust, wood chips or crushed bark as fuel for your fire. • During the day you will need to keep flies, insects and scavengers such as birds, goannas, dogs, cats and rodents away from th e meat. It is a good point to remember that any scavengers attracted to the dryi ng or smoking meat may also be a source of food to be trapped or killed. • At night all the meat strips should be taken off the drying-frame and wrapped in material to protect them from dew and moisture.

However, many of them are hard to identify without expert help and many more have sharp or tangy juices that discourag e people who cautiously taste them. It is recommended that when travelling around the st ate you should source information on edible and poisonous plants from locals, resident experts and local authorities relevant to their area. PLANTS TO AVOID The seeds of many of the native pea and bean fa mily are highly poisonous. It is best to avoid these native plants even though garden varietie s are good to eat. After a ll, if you are already working hard at surviving, you do not want to add illness to your misfortunes. You should also avoid the palm-like plants. Zami a palm fruits contain poisons and so do the young shoots. Unless you are absolutely certain of the identity of the palms that you are about to eat they are best left alone. Fungi are another group of plants best avoide d. Although many of the fungi that are found in Western Australia can be eaten they provide little nourishment and there is no rule to eliminate the deadly species. THE TASTE TEST FOR PLANT EDIBILITY Should you find vegetation that you think is edible you must carry out the taste test to reduce the chance of eating something that will harm you. Look Does it look like something you can eat. Look for poi son indicators such as prickles or milky sap. Another indicator is any fru it that is divided into five divisions. Discussion with experts will indicate peculiarities specific to particular regions. Smell Break open, crush it and smell it. Be wary of things that smell like almonds or peaches. Touch Rub on to a tender part of your body such as the inside of the wrists and wait approximately 20 minutes to see if a rash develops. Taste Rub on the inside of the lip a nd top of the tongue, testing for flavour and reaction. The plant should be discarded as a food source if a shar p, stinging or burning sensation is present. Eat Eat a very small portion if all the above tests prove negative and wait for a few hours to see if there are any reactions. If there is no reaction then you may eat a larger portion, continue to do this until you are sure that even large quantities will not harm you. Note: Always carry out the taste test on anythi ng that you cannot positively identify and remember should the part you have tested prove to be inedible then do not discard it as cooking may make it edible. If one part of a plant proves to be inedible then you should be prepared to test the other parts [roots, leaves, etc]."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 42 SOME COMMON TYPES OF EDIBLE VEGETATION Banksias [banksia sp] Flowers contain large amounts of sw eet nectar that can be sucked from the flower or stirred in water to make a refreshing sweet drink.

Berry Saltbush [rhagodia baccata] A spreading shrub that less than two metres high w ith short, grey-green leaves that grows near the coast with small edible red berries that are very sweet when ripe. Bloodroot Yams [haemodorum sp] The roots are eaten raw or mildly roaste d. They are sweet, juicy and hot, somewhat resembling a very mild onion in flavour but with considerable bite. Boab [adansonia gregorii] The nuts should be collected when mature but before they harden, the seeds and pith can be eaten raw or soaked in water, they have a taste like dried condensed milk. Bracken Fern [pteridium sp] This and some other large ferns are edible while the green shoot is in the \"fiddle head\" stage. Although they can be eaten raw, they are mo re palatable when cooked, the underground stems although stringy are rich in starch and roast up well in the campfire. Bush Tomato [solanum diversiflorum] These grey coloured shrubs grow to about 50cm and have prickles on the stem and leaves, the flowers are purple. The fruit when ripe are pale yellow with black seeds surrounded by pulp. The fruit is cooked in ashes, the seeds removed and the flesh eaten. Bulrush [typha sp] These plants generally grow along the edges of lakes, swamps and large dams. The horizontal stems are rich in starch but need pounding to separate this from the strong fibres running through the plant. Christmas Tree [nuytsia floribunda] The young roots are edible and are peeled and eaten they have a moist brittle centre that tastes like sugar. The flowers can be soaked in wate r to make a sweet refreshing drink and the gum can be eaten. Desert Raisin [solanum centrale] The fruit is initially purple-green and is eaten raw when green-white to yellow-brown. When dried it has the taste and appearance of a dried sultana and can be stored. Emu Plums [podocarpus drouynianus] A low shrub found in the southern forests yields a dark purple, edible fruit of good flavour. The attached green \"seed\" should be discarded. Figs [ficus sp] Fig trees of one kind or another are found acro ss much of Australia's inland, their glossy, green leaves are very distinctive and the red, pulpy fruits are excellent eating. Geebungs [persoonia sp] These shrubs or small trees are found mainly in th e south of the state, the pith from the small fruits are edible and tastiest when collected from beneath the tree, the skin and seeds should be spat out.

When you have become isolated from a walking party however and find yourself lost without a compass you will have to know how to navigate without map or compass to proceed on your pre-set escape route to safety. Sun Movement The sun’s position north or south of the equator is called declination. It is furthest north on June 21, crosses the equator on September 21, is farthest south on December 21 and re- crosses the equator on it’s way north on March 21. Any east–west line indicated when the sun crosses the equator on the 21 March and the 21 September will be accurate. WATCH METHOD To find north using your watch simply - 1. Stand holding your wristwatch horizontal with the figure 12 pointing at the sun 2. Bisect the angle between the hour hand and the 12 O'clock position 3. The line will indicate north [approximately] Direction-finding using a wrist watch Note: This method will not apply to areas north of the Tropic of Capricorn during the period of the midsummer equinox for your area. BUSHMAN’S METHOD Early settlers often gained a rough estimate of s outh by remembering that kangaroos rested in areas of shade during the heat of the day. They were aware of signs of disturbed earth where the kangaroos scooped out a hollow in the shade of low bushes. As we are in the southern hemisphere the shade areas were always on the southern side of the bushes. Note: This method is still applicable and may provide an easy method of direction finding in some areas."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 45 HAND SPAN METHOD The sun crosses the imaginary north/south line [meridian] every day at noon and there are 24 hours between crossings of the meridian.

To find north simply note the time and plot the sun from its present position backward or forward as the case may be to its noon position. The diagram below will give you a general indication of measuring degrees using your hand span.

You now have your earth compass. Once you decide in which direction to travel, you can stand on your makeshift compass and face the direction you intend moving. Look for a bright star or better still, a group of stars that are in the required direction and move towards them. Try to select stars that are not right on the horizon as you will lose sight of these when moving around trees. Remember that stars move from east to west in the same manner as the sun and you will have to allow for this at 15 o per hour.

A personal first aid kit and a personal survival kit should always be carried, notifications should always be posted and safe practices must be a priority. PROCEDURE IF LOST If you do become lost, try to remain cal m as panic will put you at a psychological disadvantage, the situation is not as hopeless as you may think. If by any chance you have taken the wrong track and do not know where it is going to lead you, it is pointless going on any further. It w ould be safer to return the way you came by retracing your tracks back to a point where you can establish your location. Case histories reveal that most people, when lost push on blindly in a state of panic, hoping that they might end up ‘somewhere’ . In these cases their efforts either take them further away from civilisation or around in circles. Do not under estimate the huge vastness and great distances of our Western Australian outback. In a vehicle If in a vehicle stay with or near your vehicle as it is a source of shelter and water [provided there are no chemical additives in the radiator]. Also it is easier for search parties to locate a vehicle than to locate a solitary human wandering around somewhere in the bush. If you have to leave your vehicle temporarily to search for food or water mark your trail on the ground with sticks or stones so you can find your way back. Otherwise you may find it hard to locate your vehicle once it is out of sight . Only walk in the cool part of the day to minimise fluid loss and exposure to the sun. On foot If on foot once you decide you are lost consu lt your map and use it in conjunction with your recollection of the country you have traversed to try to identify a feature. You can retrace your route to your last known position, or you can make for higher ground in an attempt to fix your position. If you are operating with a pre-set escape rout e and all attempts to fix your position have failed then you should proceed on the bearing to safety. If none of the above options apply then you s hould stay where you are, set up camp and wait for rescue.

Radio Communications For close range communication between vehicles a citizen band UHF or VHF radio may be used, however for long-range radio communication a HF radio is essential, these can be hired from communications suppliers at reasonable ra tes. Whilst travelling in the outback it is good practice to set up a communication schedule w ith the Royal Flying Doctor Service and contact them daily advising them who you are a nd where you are. Some HF radios also have an emergency beacon to contact the RFDS fitted. Satellite/Digital Telephone Communications It is now possible to ensure telephone communica tions in the outback with the introduction of a system of digital telephones that allow the user to call on his/her digital phone and be connected to a satellite system with no time de lay if in an area not covered by a digital network. This system has a saturation system of satellites that download to ground stations and ensure instantaneous voice communication with no time delay between sending and receiving. The Royal Flying Doctor Service has a toll-free emergency Satellite Telephone number that should be known and recorded as part of your trip plan. Position Indicator Beacons [EPIRB] There are several rescue instruments availabl e for the purpose of signalling for assistance, these include different types of rescue beacons. Travellers in isolated or outback areas should seriously consider their use. They can be hired from commercial outlets. Satellite Navigation Systems [GPS] Global positioning systems are available in Wester n Australia for purchase or hire. These are a hand held system that allow you to find your exact position. They also allow you to plan routes and navigate by giving you a read out of your exact heading and speed over the ground. Even though the cost may be a factor these units are of obvious value to off road travellers, particularly when travelling through unfamiliar territory. Note: Due to the technical nature of global posit ioning systems, users are advised to ensure they understand their operation fully. Map suppliers should be consulted to ensure that maps used are compatible. Not all maps [particularly older ones] use the grid system of reference used by GPS. EMERGENCY SIGNALS The following methods can be used to indicate your position. Fires A smoking fire will aid searchers, both in daylight hours and at night. Extreme care should be taken when lighting signal fires as some have got out of hand to the extent of causing major bush fires further endangering survivors and searchers. Whistle Signals Distress signal by lost party three blasts together, regularly spaced Searchers looking for lost party one blast at regular intervals Acknowledgement of distress signal two blasts repeated regularly Recall signal for search parties four blasts "},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 49 Gun Shots and Torch Flashes When using gunshots or torch flashes the signals are the same as whistle signals. Remember that guns should be discharged into soft ground, never into the air. Signalling Mirrors Signalling mirrors can be improvised by rem oving wing and rear vision mirrors from vehicles, using the mirror on orienteering compa sses [if fitted], make-up kits or using foil from survival kits if you do not have a survival mirror or heliograph. Signalling using an improvised hand-held mirror Survival Signalling Mirrors These are available commercially and are quite sm all at 7·5cm x 5cm, they are made of 5mm laminated glass with a sighting hole containing a special reflectorised screen that directs a beam of sunlight onto a target. They are operated by – 1. Holding the mirror in one hand and directing sunlight onto your other hand. 2. Slowly bring the mirror up to eye level and look through the sighting hole.

Even though no aircraft is in sight conti nue sweeping the horizon as mirror flashes can be seen for many kilometres, even in hazy weather. Ground to Air Code This is a universal code used to communicate with rescue aircraft. The figures should be approximately eight to nine metres in length and contrasting material such as rocks; logs or brush should be used. Trenches in sand can also be used to throw a shadow. Ground to air visual code for use by survivors The ground to air code that should be used by survivors is as follows; If in doubt use international symbol - 'SOS ’ V – Require assistance X – Require medical assistance ↑ - Proceeding in this direction Y - Yes or affirmative N - No or negative Actions by Aircraft • If your signals have been seen and understood the aircraft will rock from side to side in daylight hours and flash landing or navigation lights twice at night. • Lack of the above signals indicates that the message has not been understood Rescue Helicopter Never approach a helicopter on the ground.

Both should be conversant with the area. Medical limitations Prior to setting off it is essential that the leader of any group be made aware of any medical condition or any limiting personal factors affecting any member of the group. Actions-on In the interests of safety ‘actions-on’ should be set for all foreseeable emergency situations and all members of the group must know the ag reed emergency procedures. It is a good idea for an individual emergency procedure card to be printed and issued to each person. Escape Routes Escape routes should be set prior to depart ure and must be known and written down by all members of the group. Notifications Notifications need to be posted prior to depart ure and cancelled on return. Police in the area of the walk should be notified [it is good practice to discuss your plans with them]. Walking Formation In the interest of group safety a system of walking in single file through the bush is recommended rather than having the group walk scattered over a large area where should a walker be separated from the group he will most likely not be missed until the group stops at the end of the day. If the group walks in an orderly line then th ere is less chance of an individual becoming isolated.

In some cases these deaths could have been prevented if the people involved had not panicked and had a basic knowledge of bushfire survival. Here are some basic rules. Avoid Take immediate action to leave an area as soon as you become aware of the fire. Every minute may be critical especially if on foot. Panic Causes energy loss and poor judgement, act calmly and do not run. Breathing When the smoke is dense the air closest the ground will be cool and fresh. Heat Radiated heat is the real danger; use anything to avoid it such as culverts, running streams, ponds, rocks or depressions. Flame Fronts Do not attempt to run through flame fronts. Alwa ys move downhill from a fire as fires travel faster uphill. Avoid dense areas with heavy fuel such as swamps or creeks. Critical Periods When you have no possible escape you should lie on the ground [bare ground, in a rut or behind a log or rocks] or bury yourself and stay put. Clothing When you realise that you are in danger from a bush fire cover as much exposed skin as you can with any clothing available. Do not use nylon clothing. If your clothes catch fire do not run as this f eeds air to the fire, roll on the ground or use items such as blankets to smother the fire. In a vehicle Many tragedies have occurred because people left th e safety of their vehicles and tried to flee from a fire. Your vehicle will provide much protection from radiated heat. Park the vehicle in a clear area away from hea vy fuels; protect yourself from radiated heat with blankets, towels, coats, etc. Close all windows, doors and vents. Leave the hazard lights on, leave the engine running. Turn the air-conditioning on, set to re-cycle. Note: Remain in the vehicle as long as possible.

CB radios provide a cheap and reliable means of communications. The service operates in two distinct freque ncy bands - the High Frequency [HF] band [26.965 – 27.405 MHz] and the Ultra High Frequency [UHF] band [476.425 – 477.400 MHz] The service is for public access and is availa ble to everyone and as a private operator no licence or fees are required. There are specific calling channels for CB operators in both frequencies. Channel 11 [27.085MHz] & channel 16 [27.155MHz] in HF band and channel 11 [476.675MHz] in the UHF band. These are call channels and once cont act has been made conversations should be continued on another separate channel, allowi ng the call channels to remain free for other users. If you are travelling in a convoy it ma kes good sense to settle on a usual ‘working’ channel. OPERATING PROCEDURES When operating your CB radio following the guide lines set out below will assist in your transmission being received and maintenance of the mandatory standards specified for radio users by the Australian Communications Authority being maintained. • Listen before transmitting to ensure that the channel is not already in use. • Use call signs, of those stations you want and your own. • Keep conversations brief and to the point. Know what you are going to say before you start your transmission • Use the word “OVER” at the end of each transmission. This indicates you are waiting for a response. • Use the word “OUT” at the end of communica tions to indicate to other stations that you have finished and the channel is free. • Do not respond to a call not intended for your station, thus keeping the channel free of unnecessary congestion. • Use appropriate language. Your transmissi ons will be heard by anyone with a radio tuned onto your channel. • Speak clearly and slowly, holding the micr ophone 5-8cm away from the mouth. Use a normal speaking voice, there is no need to shout. • Use the phonetic alphabet when communications are difficult and accuracy is important. "},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 53 Phonetic Alphabet Using the phonetic alphabet when communications are difficult and accuracy is important will assist you; the phonetic alphabet consists of – A Alpha F Foxtrot K Kilo P Papa U Uniform B Bravo G Golf L Lima Q Quebec V Victor C Charlie H Hotel M Mike R Romeo W Whiskey D Delta I India N November S Sierra X X-ray E Echo J Juliet O Oscar T Tango Y Yankee Z Zulu Parts of a transmission • CALLSIGN - Of station called • THIS IS - Proword • CALLSIGN - Of station calling • TEXT - Message • ENDING - Proword e.g. “OUT” Prowords Prowords are words that are commonly used and accepted when making transmissions. They are designed to assist in keeping transmissions brief and conveying mean ing in a single word or short phrase. Common prowords are listed below – Proword Meaning Correct You are correct Correction An error has been made and the correct message will be sent I say again Used when repeating all or part of a message I spell Used to indicate that you are about to spell the next word phonetically Mayday A distress signal not normally used in land communications and only used in an emergency Out Transmission has ended and a reply is not required Over Transmission has ended and a reply is expected Read back Receiving callsign is to repeat th e message back to sender.

Therefore allowing timely deployment of help."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 55 EMERGENCY RADIO PROCEDURES In an emergency situation where you require assistance, specific channels are set aside for broadcast. These channels are - Channel Frequency Band   9  27.065MHz  HF      5  476.525MHz  UHF      35  477.275MHz  UHF    If your radio has the ability these emergency ch annels should be programmed into your set for easy access. These channels are monitored on a 24-hour basis by voluntary groups to assist in contacting the appropriate emergency service on your behalf. If you have had no formal radio training the following broadcast transmission guidelines will assist in obtaining assistance - Send - AB123 [or any station] This is [your call sign if you know it or your name] Urgent message, calling any station, Urgent message - Over.

"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 56 CHAPTER 6 Creek & River Crossings The question of crossing creeks and rivers is a vexed one and one that usually results in people avoiding them because of the inherent da nger. It is possible in a survival situation however that you may have no option but to cro ss a creek or waterway to make your way to safety. Note: Under no circumstances should you cross an expanse of water that is deeper than the groin level of the shortest member of your party unless your survival depends on it. If however you are required to cross a water hazard then there are accepted methods and safety procedures that can be applied. APPRECIATIONS Before proceeding, conduct a mental apprecia tion including reviewing the situation and making sure there are no alternatives and the crossing is unavoidable. Have a clear understanding of what is required by listing the f actors that will help or hinder you. Consider the courses open to you and select the best course. Considerations If you decide you have to cross then there are several points you should consider, these include - 1. The shape of the water hazard to be crossed. 2. The composition of the ground underfoot. 3. Speed of flow of the water 4. Turbulence of the water. 5. Depth of water. 6. Temperature of the water. 7. Proposed entry and exit points. 8. Capabilities of members of your group. Acceptable places to cross There are two places where you should be safe during a crossing including shallow water [approximately thigh deep] over a gravel bed w ith accessible banks or a deep, slow flowing river that is not too wide. Unacceptable places to cross High and discoloured water with exce ssive flow, volume and river width. Note: Remember you will need to consider whether to cross or not, where to cross and which method to employ."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 57 METHODS OF CROSSING CREEKS & RIVERS Without aid Used when the water is below knee deep, th e crossing should be in a diagonal downstream direction with the body parallel to the water flow . It is easier to maintain stability by ensuring one leg is upstream and one downstream. There is a danger that the rushing flow of water may cause your legs to buckle if you are facing downstream. Single pole crossing Used when the water is between the knee and gr oin in depth and the bottom is smooth with no obvious obstacles. The line of crossing should ag ain be diagonal and downstream. The pole [2 m long x 5cm diameter] must be positioned on the upstream side. You should use the pole as a prop and you should lean in to it and walk in an arc until you have to stop and re-position the pole. Note: When using this method the body should remain parallel with the water flow. Group pole crossing: Used when the water is above groin height . This method provides mutual support and is suited to groups of 3 to 6 people. The crossi ng should again be diagonal and downstream in direction. The group should be parallel to the fl ow of water with the strongest person on the upstream end and the next strongest on the dow nstream end. The pole should be grasped with the upstream arm over and the downstream arm under. Note: If conditions are too difficult then retreat by walking backwards, do not try to turn around. Swimming method Used where the crossing is deep, the river is cl ear of debris and the current is not a problem. Waterproof your pack and use it as a flotati on aid by holding it in front of you with one hand and using your other hand and legs to propel yourself forward. Points to remember The following points are listed to assist you in any water crossing – 1. Move side on to the current, take small steps and keep your eyes on the far bank. 2. Move diagonally across the river to lessen the effect of the current. 3. Never fight against the current or hold onto submerged logs or rocks. 4. Keep your boots on and avoid loose baggy clothing. 5. Wear thermal clothing next to the skin in cold conditions. 6. Waterproof your pack, loosen the shoulder straps and unfasten the waistband."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 58 CHAPTER 7 Bush First Aid First Aid is what you can do to assist an in jured person at the scene using only what is available under the prevailing circumstances. You may only have your two hands, remember that first aid does not rely on equipment. In so me circumstances if there is nothing, or nothing more to be done then first aid may mean going for assistance. Remember the patient is relying on you to go carefully to avoid accident or injury to yourself. Possibly the most important aspect of practical first aid, particular ly in the bush, is clear logical thinking and the ability to improvise. Factors First aid is based on three factors - 1. Common sense 2. Knowledge 3. Technique Order of urgency • Protection of the patient from further injury. • Ensuring first-aiders have regard for their own safety. • Restoration of breathing and heart beat. Further responsibilities Stop bleeding, minimise pain, reassure the patient, seek further aid and if necessary transport the patient to hospital. Making a diagnosis Before you can commence rational treatment, a diagnosis must be made consisting of- • History - the story of how the injury occurred • Symptoms - what the patient feels • Signs - what you can observe or find out by examination of the patient CONDITIONS Unconsciousness, shock, bleeding, pain and hysteria Unconsciousness There are many causes and these include, heart attack, drowning, electrocution, head injury, fainting and smoke inhalation. General treatment is the same - 1. Remove the patient from the cause or the cause from the patient 2. Examine the patient quickly 3. Commence cardio pulmonary resuscitation where necessary 4. Stop bleeding if necessary 5. Turn the patient on side in the recovery position"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 59 Shock Shock is a fall in blood pressure that, if uncheck ed results in irreversible changes in the body functions at cellular level resulting in death. ‘There is a point of no return’. The onset of shock is often delayed, such as when a person first st arts bleeding. They may not be shocked, but if they go on bleeding [externally or interna lly] they will eventually become shocked. Prevention is extremely important because of the ease and subtlety with which a state of irreversibility can develop. Causes of Shock Shock is caused by the actual or relative reduc tion of intravascular volume where not enough blood is available for the heart to pump to vital organs, or the pressure is too low to be of use. Specific causes of shock include bleeding, burns through loss of fluid to damaged tissues, heart attack, painful injuries, fractures, fainti ng and blood loss at fracture site. Shock is also caused by disease and infection, heat stroke, fluid loss, salt loss, fatigue and vomiting. Recognition of Shock Cold and clammy, rapid feeble pulse, rapid shallow breathing, thirst, weakness, anxiety, restlessness, inability to speak and nausea Treatment of Shock Minimise fluid loss, raise the legs, protect fr om elements, maintain temperature, reassure, moisten lips and do not give alcohol. BASIC LIFE SUPPORT In the management of collapse it is important th at no time is wasted. Stay with the collapsed person and follow the steps as outlined below - COLLAPSE Check response to shake & shout  CONSCIOUS Make comfortable Observe - Airway Breathing Circulation UNCONSCIOUS Turn on side Clear Airway Head tilt, jaw support, turn face slightly downward, check breathing  BREATHING Leave on side Observe - Airway Breathing Circulation NOT BREATHING Place on back EAR - 5 breaths in 10 seconds then - Check pulse  PULSE PRESENT Continue EAR Check pulse and breathing after 1 min. Then every 2 mins PULSE ABSENT CPR [EAR & ECC] Check breathing and pulse after 1 min. Then every 2 mins "},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 60 FRACTURES The key to the treatment of fractures is immob ilisation. A mobile fracture is painful, can cause internal bleeding, may become compound [break through the skin] and is a major cause of shock. Treatment of Fractures Assess the situation and see if you can immobilis e the site, reduce or re-position [only reduce a fracture if you must] and then support [axial traction if necessary.] Method of Immobilisation • Fingers - strap the broken one to the adjacent finger • Legs - strap legs together or splint • Pelvis - strap legs together • Upper arm - collar and cuff sling and bandage upper arm to chest • Ribs - leave alone Note: If the patient faints with pain do not stop, reduce and splint the fracture FRACTURES OF THE SPINE Fractures of the spine are associ ated with large forces and may be complicated by damage to the spinal cord. Therefore to avoid permanen t damage, careful protective handling aimed at minimising spinal cord damage is essential. Signs and Symptoms These may range from severe pain to loss of sensations and lack of control over limbs. Treatment The aim of treatment is to prevent farther da mage by immobilising the spine. If the patient should be immobilised do so by strapping the legs together, maintaining body position with improvised padding and keeping the head straight and in extension to ensure an open airway. SPRAINS Sprains involve the abnormal stretching or the partial tearing of the supporting ligaments of any joint, ankles are the most common in outdoor activities. Diagnosis Pain, swelling, tenderness and bruising but still able to use the joint or limb. Treatment In bush walking situations it may be better not to remove the boot if it comes above the ankle. Otherwise contrast bathing if available [alternat e bathing in warm and cold water, 5 minutes at a time] or immerse in cold water for 15 minutes then bandage."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 61 HEAD INJURY If a patient is unconscious and has not obvious ly been electrocuted or drowned then you should think of head injury, remember there may be no signs. Bleeding from the nose, mouth or ears may indicate a fracture of the skull. If a patient who has been unconscious recovers and then loses consciousness again you may assume head injury. Treatment Treatment is very simple and general first aid principles apply. Turn into the recovery position and transport to hospital. BURNS AND SCALDS • 1st degree - superficial burns such as sunburn • 2nd degree - partial thickness burns where blisters are present • 3rd degree - full thickness with charred skin or white skin with a red edge Rule of 9's The area of burn is important once the burn has been diagnosed as 2nd degree or worse. The burnt area can be assessed as a percentage of the body surface using the following table - Arms 9% x 2 18% Lower leg 9% x 2 18% Upper leg 9% x 2 18% Stomach 9% x 1 9% Buttocks 9% x 1 9% Chest 9% x 1 9% Back 9% x 1 9% Head 9% x 1 9% Groin 1% x 1 1%   100% Note: Tremendous fluid loss to the damaged tissues occurs with burns and in the event of a person sustaining partial thickness burns then 5% will require hospitalisation and 9% will require intra venous fluid, with full thickness burns 2.5% requires hospitalisation and 5% will require intra venous fluid. Treatment Cold water should be used for any burn of any thickness. Do not use butter as this will introduce bacteria and leave any blisters intact. The use of an antibiotic cream or Betadine oint ment is useful to prevent infection because infection will convert a partial thickness burn into a full thickness burn."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 62 BLEEDING Blood flows through the circulatory system using ar teries and veins, if there is a break or a hole in an artery or vein then bleeding will occur. Treatment Simply plug the hole, do not worry about whethe r it is arterial or venous bleeding. Remember, ‘bleeding is bleeding’. First wipe away a ny blood or remove the clothing so you can see where the bleeding is coming from. Next hold, press or apply pressure with a pad and bandage the source of the bleeding. Then elevate the bleeding site if practical. If there is much bleeding the patient will develop shock quickly. Note: Tourniquets are generally a big ‘no - no’ and are only to be used if you cannot stop the bleeding in any other way. Tourniquets do cause more damage and the limb may be lost altogether but use common sense, if t he limb is severed use a tourniquet first as you cannot do any further damage to a limb that is not there. PAIN There are many causes of pain. They may be uncomfortable, incapacitating or minor injuries. [stings, bites, splinters, blisters] remove the cause and/or treat the injury. HYSTERIA Defined as irrational behaviour caused by fear or anxiety such as claustrophobia when caving, freezing when climbing a rock face or crossing a stream by way of a log bridge. Treatment Reassure and secure the patient from danger. This may mean immobilising him/her or roping them to a rock face or whatever. Retrieve th e patient by leading or removing him/her off the offending environment to a secure position. ASPHYXIA Asphyxia is a state of unconsciousness induced by lack of air due to drowning, smoke inhalation, choking [foreign body in throat], foul ai r or gas, suffocation by sand or paralysis of respiratory muscles as in blue ringed octopus bites or cone shell stings. Treatment Begin cardio pulmonary resuscitation [CPR] and keep going until help arrives, remember this may be 1 or 2 hours or more. Note: Marine stings, cone shell and blue ringed octopus victims may start breathing by themselves some considerable time after lapsing into unconsciousness."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 63 INSECT BITES The only fatal bites are from ticks [spiders ar e not insects]. Red back spiders and scorpions cause pain, not death. The other major problem is allergy. An anaphylactic [severe allergic] reaction may occur in some cases such as bee s tings, wasp stings, ant bites or ingestion of certain foods such as shellfish for some people. Treatment Insects inject their venom below the skin and the sk in is there to keep in what's in and what's out, out and it mainly does that, but things lik e alcohol, ammonia and methylated spirits may be useful as counter irritants. In bee-stings th e poison sac is attached to the sting and the sting being barbed will often remain in the skin. It should be removed with the blade of a knife or the edge of a piece of paper, not between the fingers as this will squeeze the venom sac and inject more venom. Ticks should be removed usi ng alcohol to irritate and then prying it off using tweezers on either side of the mouth part. Do not hold by the body and pull it off as this may leave mouth parts embedded in the skin. Prevention Simple self protection measures can be used to minimise contact including avoiding outdoor activity at dawn and dusk, wearing long sleeved, light coloured loose clothing and not using perfume, cologne or after shave. Use insect repellents with a DEET content of between 15 – 20% on exposed skin. SNAKE BITE Ninety per cent of snake bites in Australia are at the ankle or below, eight per cent occur on the hands and two per cent elsewhere on the body. Assume all snakes are venomous. Always believe someone when they say they have been bitten, even though you may not see any puncture marks. Nine deaths have been attribut ed to snakebite in Western Australia in the period from 1980 - 2001. Signs and Symptoms Puncture marks, slight bruising, redness and sw elling, nausea, sweating, diarrhoea, pains in the chest and double vision. Treatment 1. Apply broad firm elastic pressure bandage over bite and as much of the limb as possible. After covering bite continue ba ndaging up the limb and if sufficient bandage back down again. 2. Immobilise limb with splint. On leg, splint in straight position. On forearm, splint to elbow and support arm in sling. 3. Keep victim still. Bring transport to victim and convey to nearest hospital. 4. For bites on trunk of body or face, apply local pressure only with flat of hand. Note: Do not wash venom from bite site. Bandages and splints should be left on and removed only by a doctor. Prevention The best guard against snakebite is protection. If you wear above ankle boots and/or thick socks and long trousers you are less likely to be bitten by anything. Use gloves when collecting firewood, never put your hand under a nything without first rolling it over with your boot and watch where you put your feet when walk ing and never step over logs, always step up on them and then step down."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 64 CUTS AND ABRASIONS Treatment Clean with water and apply antiseptic cream or solution as this may prevent infection later. Cover with band-aid, dressing or bandage to avoid further contamination of the wound. BLISTERS Treatment Leave them intact, if you make a hole for the fluid or blood to get out you have made a hole for germs to get in. Pad away from the area cau sing pressure using band-aids, felt strips, a felt pad with a hole cut in it or a specially designed blister dressing Note: Do not put the dressing directly on the bliste r unless it is specifically designed for this purpose as this increases pressure. SPLINTERS Treatment The skin is very elastic therefore a splinter stre tches the skin as it goes in and the skin then closes over it or at least grips the splinter. A sm all [painless] superficial cut with a scalpel at the site of entry is helpful in removing the splinter. CARE OF FEET Your feet get you wherever you are going, especia lly on bush walks, it is therefore important to take care of them. Wear suitable footwear, preferably hiking boots or shoes with a heavy sole, hygiene is important so wash feet daily and apply foot powder CASUALTY ACTION If you are on foot in a group and a member su stains an injury preventing him/her being carried out then a team consisting of at least two people should remain with the casualty. A second team of no less than two people should con tinue to the next organised check point or aid station with a written casualty report containing – • Designation of the group • The names of all group members. • Name of casualty • The nature of the problem or injury. • Assistance required. • Map details and the location of the casualty. • The food and water state of the group.

Mild Hypothermia Skin feels cold, looks blue or livid [mottled], the patient shivers and feels cold. Severe Hypothermia Skin is cold and mottled, no shivering [shive ring response has failed], irrational behaviour and speech, may be uncooperative, may be unconscious. If so is near death. Treatment Shelter in a warm dry environment and replace wet clothing with dry clothing, leave arms and legs cold but insulate limbs with blankets to minimise further heat loss. Re-warm critical areas [chest, neck and h ead] by body-to-body contact with two or more persons or by placing heated objects such as hot rocks [wrapped in towels to prevent burning the skin] about the areas mentioned, particularly the sides of the chest. Breathe warm air near the patient's mouth [s everal people if possible] to warm the air breathed into the lungs. If conscious, re-hydrate with warm drinks [non-alcoholic].

Signs of Death • Fixed dilated pupils, not responding to resuscitation. • Absence of spontaneous heart beat in spite of prolonged resuscitation. • Rigor mortis [stiffening of the body] is a late but reliable sign of death. Note: Resuscitation should never be stopped when medical aid is imminent. Dealing with a Dead Body Whilst this may be an unpleasant topic it is a po ssibility that should be dealt with properly to avoid further stress among witnesses and address the problem in a manner to satisfy the law and to facilitate the later recovery of the body. If on foot the group should not attempt to carry the body out with them and for purposes of morale should not split themselves up and have some of the group remain while others go for help. They should leave the body and walk out in a group. Before doing this you should carry out the following procedure - 1. Get everybody in the group to take careful notes of the circumstances surrounding the death, as statements will be required for the coroner. 2.

Maps enable user s to find their way about the country; allow recognition of features and gives the user an understanding of the information given on the map allowing it to be related to the surrounding countryside. Maps also assist in the transmission of information. MAP READING Map reading is the extraction of information shown on the map; the relationship of the ground to the map and the map to the ground. To make full use of a map, it is necessary to give and read grid references, to take bearings and to measure distances. The ability to use or read a map is called ‘map craft’. Reliability of maps A map is a plan of the ground. Remember however, it is a plan of the ground at a certain date. If it is a long time since the map was produced or revised much may have changed. Towns grow, roads and railways are built and forests gr ow and are cut down. No map can be taken as being reliable except concerning the main physi cal features of the land. Even these may change slowly, as coastlines erode and in some places rivers may even change their courses. Note: It is very important to note the date the map was produced or revised and to judge its reliability accordingly. Care of maps Maps are valuable documents and the supply is never unlimited and they should be treated with care to prevent damage. Most damage to maps occurs when the users open them outdoors or in moving vehicles. There is always the chance of a slight breeze that might catch them and start small tears that can quickly spread. To prevent tears, maps should be folded in such a way that any part can be referred to without having to be fully opened. Once a map is folded, leave it folded, the detail at creases is sure to deteriorate but less than if the map was constantly unfolded and folded. Pr otect the folded map by placing it in a plastic map case when not in use. Marginal information Printed around the margin of the map is the info rmation needed when the map is being used. This is referred to as Marginal Information. Th e type of information and the layout may differ from map to map."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 71 Marginal Information Contents On Australian maps a standard layout is adopted which gives the following information - • Sheet Name This is usually shown on the top centre of the map • Map Edition Usually located at the top right of the map • Sheet Number Maps are commonly referred to by sheet number, name and edition • Grid Reference Block Located at the bottom of the map and expl ains how to calculate a six figure grid reference • Legend Panel Located at the bottom of the map and gives a legend of the conventional signs used • Sheet History Located at the bottom of the map and gives production details • Index to Adjoining Sheets Located at the bottom the map • Magnetic Variation Information Located at the bottom of the map and gives the annual magnetic variation • Reliability Diagram This diagram does not appear on all maps, i ndicates the reliability of the information shown on a map • Representative Fraction A method of indicating the scale of the map. Usually located at the top left of the map. • Linear Scale Usually located at the bottom centre of the map Conventional signs or legend The mapmaker tries to show objects on the gr ound in the clearest possible way. These objects are not shown as they appear because they w ould be too small to recognise. Instead, simple symbols, referred to as conventional signs are us ed to indicate the objects. It is important to note that the centre base of the particular sign indicates the position of the object on the map. Scale The scale of a map is the relationship of th e distance between two points on the map and the distance between the same two points on the ground. Other types of maps The information contained in this manual refers mainly to topographical maps. These maps present a complete and accurate picture of the ground by showing as much detail as their scale allows. It may be that accurate topographical maps are not available for a particular area and in this case an alternate map such as a ro ad map, orthophotomap or air photograph will have to be used."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 72 TERMS USED IN MAP READING Some terms used in map reading to describe physical features include – Basin An area of reasonably level ground surrounded, or nearly surrounded by hills. It can also be the description used to depict the area drained by a river and it’s tributaries. Breakaway A small gully or low cliff line formed by erosion. Crest The highest part of a hill or mountain range. Speci fically it is that line on a range of hills or mountains from which the ground slopes down in opposite directions. Escarpment The steep hillside formed by a sudden drop in th e general ground level. This feature usually comes off a plateau. Gorge A deep ravine usually with very steep sides. Knoll A small knob-like hill. Plateau A tableland or generally level elevated region of considerable extent. Ravine A long, deep valley worn by a stream. Re-entrant A valley or ravine usually located between two spurs running inwards towards the hill or mountain-top. Ridge The line along a hill or range of hills or mount ains from which the water flows in opposite directions. Sometimes it is described as the crest of a line of hills as it appears along the horizon. Saddle A depression between adjacent hill or mountain-tops; also called a col. Spur A minor feature generally in the form of a ridge running out from the hill or mountain. Undulating ground Ground that rises and falls gently.

It can be in the form of a pre- prepared card or alternatively data written in a notebook. The route plan expresses the intentions of th e individual or group as to where they are going, how long it should take and what to do in the event of an emergenc y. If in a group it is important that everybody in a group has the same information. The process of preparing a navigation route pl an whereby members of the group are required to sit down and express their ideas and reach conc lusions by consensus is an integral part of the teambuilding process. Such information should include - Group details Name of the group, the full names of all gr oup members and whether any members of the group have any limiting medical conditions or are taking any medication. Map details The map title, edition number and scale should be recorded along with the magnetic variation applicable to the map. A sketch map should be drawn. Route details This should include Route numbers and the numbers of legs, which make up each route. Waypoints Details of each waypoint or landmark should in clude not only its position expressed as a six- figure grid reference but also a detailed description of that location. Distance The distance to be covered should be expresse d in metres over the ground and an estimate of the number of paces required to cover the distance. Heading The grid bearing should be determined and th e magnetic bearing to be walked should be calculated by applying the magnetic variation for the map to the grid bearing. Both bearings should be recorded. Description of going A ‘section’ of each leg must be drawn and ente red in the route plan as a cross-sectional diagram supported by a description of the terrain, density of vegetation and any features that will be encountered. Estimating journey time Estimates of journey times should be calculated using Naismith’s Rule. This rule is a guide only and can be modified with experience.

Next lay the paper along the linear scale and w ith the right hand mark against one of the primary divisions and the left hand mark against the secondary divisions to the left of the zero point on the scale. The total distance is the distance to the right of zero, plus the distance to the left of zero. Measuring distance [3.7 km or 3700 m] PACING When it is important that you locate a particular feature and you need to know accurately how far you have travelled it will be necessary to pace the distance. This is done by counting the number of double paces, left foot to left foot, or right foot to right foot . You will need to work out exactly how many paces you walk over one hundred metres. Note: Most people on flat ground average 130 paces per 100 metres. THE POINTS OF A COMPASS North, East, South and West are the four cardinal points of the compass. There are, in all, 32 points of the compass, but only sixteen are norma lly used in map reading. These are the four cardinal points and twelve intermediate points. The degree system The points of the compass give an approxima te indication of direction only, for greater accuracy the circle is divided into 360 degrees [O or 360 being the north point]. The four quadrants of the circle are each 90 de grees and therefore the East, South and West points are at 90, 180 and 270 degrees respectively. Each degree is subdivided into 60 minutes and each minute into 60 seconds. Degrees are marked o minutes ' and seconds \". When the compass is being used, the subdivisions of a degree are too small for practical use and readings to one degree are generally sufficient."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 77 Points of a compass Note: Some organizations [Australian Army] measure angles in mils; 6,400 mils = 360 ° . Bearings The purpose of a bearing is to give an accurate indication of the direc tion of one point from another. A bearing is the angle, measured clockw ise, that a line makes with a fixed zero line. The zero line is always taken to be north. Measuring bearings in degrees [A - B = 045 degrees] NORTH POINTS In map reading, reference is made to three north points and each is detailed below: True North The earth spins on an axis that passes through the north and south poles. The North Pole is geographical north, or true north. Lines drawn from the North Pole to the South Pole are true north - south lines. True north is therefore th e direction from any point on the earth's surface to the North Pole. Magnetic North To say a compass points north is only relatively true because a compass needle does not point to the North Pole. It points to a place in the far north of Canada known as the magnetic pole. The direction a compass needlepoints is known as magnetic north. 180 000 090 270 045 135 225 315"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 78 Grid North The grid lines on a map do not lie true north and south, except along one standard meridian; elsewhere on the map they make an angle with th e true north south line. Since the grid lines are parallel and are drawn on the map it is very convenient to use them for drawing or measuring bearings. The direction of the north -south grid lines [eastings] is therefore known as grid north. The Orienteering Compass The orienteering compass was developed in the 1930's and are now used widely throughout the world by armed forces and many other orga nizations as a general-purpose compass. The most useful and durable of these have a base plate which makes the carrying of a protractor unnecessary. They also come complete with a cover which provides protection and a mirror which makes sighting objects easier as well as doubling as a signal mirror in emergencies. The Silva 15T orienteering compass with cover and sighting mirror Use of the compass Because of its unique design, the orienteering compass is very simple to use. To take a grid bearing from a map The procedure for calculating a grid bearing from a map is as follows – 1. Place the long edge of the compass plate along the desired bearing making sure that the direction of travel line on the compass plate points in the direction you wish to travel [if your compass has a sighting mirror at the front remember this coincides with the direction of travel line]. 2. Turn the compass housing so that the meridi an lines are parallel with the grid lines [eastings] on the map. 3. Read the grid bearing on the housing where the index line intersects it.

The position of the magnetic pole is not fixed, it moves slightly from year to year . As a consequence, the direction of magnetic north, and therefore the magnetic variation al so changes by a small amount each year. Though this change is not constant it can be forecas t with sufficient accuracy over a number of years and details of the annual change are given in the marginal information as illustrated in the diagram.  Example of magnetic variation diagram Lines joining places with equal magnetic va riation are known as isogonals. They do not themselves point in the direction of magnetic nor th. It might be expected that isogonals would follow a regular pattern but the earth's magnetic field at any point is affected by the land and mountain masses and the presence of metallic ores . Therefore, the isogonals are pulled out of shape and follow no regular pattern. Adjusting grid bearings for variation When the compass is used with a map or in conjunction with map bearings, an adjustment should be made to allow for the variation. This is especially important if there is considerable variation in your area or if accuracy is important . With one turn of the dial you can make the proper allowance of any variation. You must do this every time you wish to apply a variation to a bearing. Find out the amount of variation in your area and then simply turn the dial as per the following rule- • From grid to magnetic If the variation works out to be west, th en you will need to leave the compass on the map and turn the dial west the required number of degrees. If the variation is east then turn the dial east. • From magnetic to grid Simply reverse the step.

Contour lines make no attempt to give any visu al illusion of relief and it is the failure to recognise this that causes difficulty to some people, in understanding them. The idea of a contour is very simple. It is an imaginary line drawn on a map, joining all places of equal height above sea level. Height of Contours On the map each contour is drawn at a specific height above sea level and the vertical distance between each is the same. The difference in he ight between contours is called the Vertical Interval and is shown in the marginal information on the map. It is from the height and spacing of the contour s that the shape of the ground is deduced and if necessary it can be calculated accurately. Some c ontour lines have the height above sea level printed at intervals along their length. Another simple starting point in determining th e general topography of an area is to use the flow of streams in conjunction with contours. Contour Patterns Each topographical feature such as a spur or a knoll is represented by its own particular contour pattern. Important Points The most important points to remember about contour patterns are – • Contour lines close together indicate steep slopes • Contour lines far apart indicate gentle slopes • Evenly spaced contour lines indicate uniform slopes • When the spacing of contour lines, reading fr om high to low, decreases, the slope is convex • When the spacing of contour lines, reading fr om high to low, increases, the slope is concave Contour patterns"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 81 DRAWING A SECTION To draw a section between two points on a map lay the edge of a piece of paper between the two points, mark it at these two points and agai n where the contours on the map cut this edge.

From each mark you have made on the edge of the paper drop a line to the corresponding height line and join these points to complete a section.

Set the magnetic bearing on the compass by rotating the compass housing until the required bearing is in line with the index line on the compass plate. 2. Holding the compass flat in the palm of the hand turn around until the red end of the compass needle points to the north mark on the compass housing and is parallel to the meridian lines. 3. The direction arrow now points along the required magnetic bearing."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 82 TO TAKE A MAGNETIC BEARING The procedure for taking magnetic bearings to an object is detailed below – 1. Hold the compass with the direction arrow pointing to the object. 2. Rotate the compass housing until the red a rrow of the meridian lines is directly beneath the red [north] end of the compass needle. 3. Read the magnetic bearing on the housing where the index line intersects it. BACK BEARINGS Unlike most other types of compasses there is no requirement to calculate back bearings with the orienteering compass. Simply turn around to face approximately the direction travelled along and reverse the compass so that the dir ection arrow is towards the user. Orient the compass by turning the whole body until the red end of the compass needle points to the north point on the housing and travel in the direction in which the rear of the compass plate faces. ALTERING DIRECTION TO AVOID AN OBSTACLE There may be occasions when it will be necessary to alter the direction of travel to avoid a major obstacle. This is best done by travelli ng around the obstacle using a series of right angles. With the orienteering compass this can be done without any alterations to the original compass setting simply by taking advantage of the right angles of the compass plate. Altering direction using the base plate of a compass COMPASS ERRORS When using a magnetic compass, the user should be aware of the two ma in causes of variation in compass readings: Individual Compass Error Each compass has its individual variation that is it does not point exactly to magnetic north, the compass needle itself may not be quite tr ue with the markings on the card and slight divergences may be caused in other ways. The error may be negligible or comparatively large and therefore it is important to have compasses checked regularly. Any known error should be noted on the compass and when readings are taken allowance must be made for the individual variation."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 83 Local Magnetic Attraction Local magnetic attraction is due to the pres ence of any iron ore nearby. The compass is a delicate instrument and quite small quantities of iron have a surprisingly large effect on its behaviour. A wristwatch or steel framed spectacles will affect the compass reading. Take the precaution of seeing that all iron or st eel objects are at a safe distance before using the compass. Small articles will be safe in a trouser pocket but larger articles should be placed two or three metres away. Note: Remember to keep away from power lines, wire fences, vehicles and railway lines when using a magnetic compass. COMPASS RESECTIONS The following procedure can be used to fix your position when you can recognise features on the ground and on the map but are unable to fix your exact map position. 1. Select 2 or 3 prominent, widely spaced f eatures that you can recognise on the map and on the ground. 2. Using the compass, take a magnetic bearing to the first feature. 3. Convert the magnetic bearing to a grid bearing. 4. Convert the grid bearing to a back bearing and plot this bearing with a thin line from the feature on the map. Carry out the above procedure until you have plo tted the back bearings on the map from each of the features you have selected, your position is th at point where the back bearings intersect. Should they form a small triangle then your pos ition is the centre of the triangle, however, there should be sufficient detail on the ground and the map to confirm this. Global Positioning Systems GPS stands for Global Positioning System. It is a military satellite-based navigation system, free for civil use. The system was developed by the US Department of Defence and owned by the Department of Transportation. The process of Selective Availability [S/A] wa s turned off in May 2000. Selective availability caused the GPS position to drift randomly & unpredictably giving an inaccurate reading position up to several hundred metres from the true location. Selective availability was at best accurate up to 100 metres for 95% of the time a nd up to 300 metres the other 5% of the time. GPS accuracy is now to within 10 metres of the true position at all times. The system uses 24 satellites that circle the earth twice a day in 6 pre set orbits at an altitude of 22,200 kilometres to calculate position, altitude and velocity. This is achieved by GPS receivers on the ground using these satellites as precise reference points to fix their position by measuring the travel time of a signal tr ansmitted from each satellite. The GPS then computes it’s distance from the satellite and with this distance and distances from at least 4 satellites can deliver reliable predictions.

It is important to remember that as well as recrea tional bushwalking in small groups there is much interest in the more institutional ‘expedition sk ills training’. This aspect of bushwalking is generally oriented toward youth groups and edu cational institutions. An expedition is defined as a journey with a purpose. Groups and organisations are encouraged in the in terest of safety to prepare a written plan and leave a copy with police in the area of the e xpedition as part of their ‘notification’. THE ROLE OF EXPEDITIONS Expedition training presents an exciting challenge to groups, it requires them to train for and carry out expeditions or explorations with a specific purpose in unfamiliar country. Prior planning & preparation Organising, planning, training for and completi ng any expedition requires a high level of teamwork, self-reliance and co-operation betw een group members. Emphasis should be on a preliminary training program designed to develop specific skills related to the particular type of expedition. Ideally the expedition should aim at encouraging group members to gain confidence in meeting new challenges and to develop a spirit of adventure through personal accomplishment. Expedition purpose All expeditions should have a clearly defined pre-conceived purpose and all members of the group should have been involved in the planning process and be aware of the purpose of the expedition. EXPEDITION LEADERSHIP Organisers of expeditions must be aware of their responsibility under duty-of-care legislation and any appointed leaders should be prepared to accept responsibility for the safety of the group on expedition. Duty of expedition leaders The duty owed by an expedition leader to a group can best be described as the duty of a reasonably prudent leader or supervisor who has a duty to take reasonable care to avoid exposing the group to unnecessary risk of injury and while there may be no consideration of remuneration there is nevertheless a relationship whereby the group may be expected to submit to a course of instruction which at tim es will require them to undertake training and perform tasks in what may prove to be dangerous situations. The expedition leader is required to provide a safe system for the group and give adequate instruction. There is seen to be an element of dependence upon the leader by the group. Note: The expedition organiser is required to guard against a risk of harmful event and injury that is reasonably foreseeable."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 85 Qualifying expeditions Organisers should be satisfied that the gr oup has completed an appropriate course of instruction for the proposed expedition. Wher e the requirements for a qualifying expedition state the group must act independently and not be accompanied they should ensure the group are capable of conducting the planned expedition. Under normal circumstances and if the age of the group requires it the group should be accompanied on the expedition. If they are acco mpanied on any qualifying venture the leader must ensure that all decisions affecting the outcome of the expedition are made by the group members. Leaders acting in a supervisory capacity and not accompanying the group must remain in close proximity. The supervisor should be in contact with the group throughout the day and for reasons of safety be available at night. Note: The supervisor should have good oversight of the group throughout and accept responsibility for their plans and safety. PRE-WALK CONSIDERATIONS To walk with the least impact on the environment the right equipment is needed and all expeditions should be well planned with environmental impact a major consideration. Expedition members All group members should have completed a preliminary expedition skills training programme applicable to the level of the expedition. Notifications Before you leave let someone know where you will be walking, where you will camp, when you are due back and what equipment the group is carrying. A copy of your plan should be lodged with police in the area of the expedition. Group size Go in a small party [6-10] rather than a larg e one. Large parties usually have more impact on the environment and are socially more unw ieldy. Should your group be larger, split up and meet at meal times and at campsites suitable for large groups. Land owners As a courtesy ensure that landowners have b een contacted before entering their property. If traversing aboriginal land make sure you have the necessary permits, etc. Environmental impact In some national parks walking tracks have been upgraded to offset the impact of increasing foot traffic. You can help limit damage by st aying on the track and walking through rough and muddy sections rather than widening the dama ge by walking on track edges. Also avoid cutting corners on steep 'zigzag' tracks. Both these practices increase erosion and visu al scarring as well as causing confusion for future walkers. Sensitive vegetation is easily destroyed by trampling, so stay on rocks and hard ground wherever possible. Choose your f ootwear for the terrain. Solid lightweight walking boots can be used on most tracks. W ear joggers around the campsite rather than thongs or bare feet."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 86 THE EXPEDITION PLANNING PROCESS Expeditions require plans to be produced and briefings and de-briefings to be conducted. Briefings are the provision of general informa tion whilst plans contain directives. The de- briefing is used to obtain on-going information and eventual assessment. BRIEFINGS The two distinct parts to a briefing are the pr eparation of the briefing and the conduct of the briefing. Preparation for a briefing session Experience has proven that the selection of th e best possible venue, and the use of suitable aids will enhance the value of the briefing. Things to be considered include presentation, venue, location, lighting and weather protec tion. Briefing aids include maps, models, photographs and display boards. Conduct of a briefing session Having prepared the venue and aids, the briefi ng should be conducted in such a manner that the briefing officer controls the activity. Th e sequence is to conduct an introduction, make sure everyone can see, encourage the taking of notes and set up a format for asking questions. EXPEDITION PLANS Expedition plans are the vehicle by which the expedition plan is conveyed to those involved in the expedition. Such orders need to be corr ectly prepared, presented in a systematic way and re-examined as a result of information gained through de-briefings. They must be accurate, brief but clear, contain all necessary in formation and most importantly be capable of being actioned. Layout of expedition plans Plans need to follow a logical sequence to ensu re all aspects are covered. The five headings covered by the plan should include - S Situation M Mission E Execution A Administration & Logistics C Command & Communications SITUATION [introduction] Gives background information in sequence and gi ves general details of the expedition, people involved, topography, others in the area and any resources available. MISSION [expedition purpose] A clear, concise single purpose statement of the overall outcome to be achieved."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 87 EXECUTION [how the expedition will be conducted] Details how the mission will be accomplished a nd includes a general outline including details of roles, tasks, method, boundaries and special equi pment. This section of the plan should also contain the co-ordinating instructions for the expedition. Actions On [contingency plans] Actions to be taken in the event of an emergency or an unexpected happening. These include when the expedition is terminated before the planned finishing time, injuries, lost persons, vehicle break-down, medical emergencies and casualty evacuations. Co-ordinating Instructions These are the details common to all members by which the expedition organiser or leader maintains control. Includes details of timings, movement, navigation and transport. ADMINISTRATION & LOGISTICS [what is needed and what will be provided] Details of food and water, re-supply arrangements and dress and equipment requirements. COMMAND & COMMUNICATIONS [leader details and any communications] Who will be in control and details of communi cations system including the type of radio, primary and secondary frequencies, call signs, situation reports, radio schedule times, code words and details of telephones and any other methods of communicating. DE-BRIEFINGS No expedition should be concluded until a de-bri efing has been conducted. This is the primary method employed to assess performance. De pending on the size of the activity and the number of participants there may be different types of de-briefings including phase de- briefings to update information and revise pl ans and de-briefing of all involved prior to conclusion to determine effectiveness. De-briefing Methodology It is a good idea to have a structured appro ach to de-briefings which requires course participants to analyse the experience by concentrating on performance and outcomes. Activities should be examined to determine what went well and what did not, rather than who went well and who did not. This separation of ego from performance is vital. Activities should be addressed by sequentially examining the following specific aspects – Facts This aspect deals with what has occurred and should concentrate on data and facts. Emotions Participants should be encouraged to disc uss how they feel about the experience and concentrate on intuition, gut feelings, emotions and hunches. Negatives Everybody should be given the opportunity to discu ss what did not fit and to be judgemental. This aspect deals with negatives, caution, risk and why things went wrong. Positives This aspect should always be dealt with after the negatives and should address what went well. It encourages optimistic thinking and deals with positives, benefits and merit. Creativity Deals with growth, ideas, alternative uses for what has been learned and future possibilities. Focus Finally the group should focus on whether the ac tivity delivered and if all objectives were achieved and the purpose accomplished. Focus s hould be maintained by managing thinking, setting agendas and setting change for future activities."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 88 PRACTICAL BUSHWALKING For members of a group to walk a long way w ith packs on their backs is as much about mental attitude, self-discipline and teamwork as about physical effort. Setting off The first step is to agree on a time of departure and for all to be ready to depart on time with all packs properly packed, being suitably dresse d for the weather and taking a last look over the campsite to make sure nothing has been left behind. The first leg of the route should be appraised and maps should be ready. Walking rhythm After making a note of the time on your route pl an card set off, walking at a slow, steady, deliberate pace. Establish a walking rhythm be aware of it and try to maintain it. Observations Keep checking the landmarks and terrain with the map as you reach them. After you have been walking for fifteen or twenty minutes it ma y be necessary to remove or adjust clothing. It is vital to avoid clothing being soaked in perspiration. Coping with steep terrain When the trail becomes steep, shorten your stride but try to maintain the same steady rhythm. If the route should become steeper it will be necessary to zigzag to reduce the steepness of the climb. This enables the heel of the foot to be placed on the ground as it places a great strain on the leg muscles if you only walk on the front of the foot. Walking down steep terrain may not be exhausti ng but it can be uncomfortable and more slips and falls occur while descending than wh ile climbing. When you walk on flat ground you automatically lean forward to maintain bala nce, when walking downhill there is often a tendency to lean back, away from the slope, wh ich can have upsetting results. Make sure that you bend the knees to avoid jarring the joints and zigzag downhill in the same fashion as walking up hill. By doing this, rhythm can be ma intained and the whole of the foot can be placed firmly on the ground to improve grip and reduce the chance of slipping. Note: Never run downhill and always be careful never to dislodge stones that may injure anyone below. Wet weather routine If it should start to rain the whole group shoul d decide to stop together and don wet weather clothing. It is as important to pr event clothing being soaked with rain as it is with perspiration. Schedules If the group is falling behind time it may be necessary to reduce some of the breaks or meal stops to catch up with the schedule. This should be discussed within the group to ensure that any changes are not going to place unreal expect ations on individuals. It may be that your schedule is beyond the physical capabilities of the group or individuals within the group. It is a good idea to be realistic when setting sc hedules and build in an amount of recovery time into a route plan to cope with unforeseen circumstances or slow pace over the ground."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 89 Action at waypoints Once you have completed each leg note the time a nd attend to all needs during the break such as adjusting clothing and packs, checking the route plan, studying the map and visualising the next leg before noting the time and resuming your journey. Personal fitness Much of the slow progress and unduly prolonged journey times associated with expeditions lasting a few days are due to a lack of physical fitness. This is especially apparent when faced with carrying a loaded pack. Any physical exercise or training that will increase stamina will be beneficial before undertaking an extended bushwalking expediti on. The personal fitness levels of group members should be accounted for in the planning stage. JOURNAL WRITING Journals can help to measure the process and task orientation of an expedition by providing expedition members with a vehicle to focus in a rational way and then reflect on the processes involved in the expedition. They can also be a source of enjoyment and interest for recreational bushwalkers. Interest can be heightened by the inclusion of sketches, maps and photographs. Journal writing guidelines The following are general guidelines to what might be written in a journal - • Feelings on commencing the expedition. • Understanding of the processes involved and what it is like to be involved. • Performance as a group member. • Feelings as a leader when [and if] required to lead. • Ability and willingness to achieve the set objectives. • Identifiable behaviour both of self and others. • Any obvious areas of concern. • Comments on planning, clothing, equipment and food. • Any plan for future change not only for physical resources but also behaviours. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS Before any trip the leader and the group should discuss and set their trip objectives. It is important that these should be within the capabilities of the entire group. Responsibilities of organisers Organisers should realise the scope of their re sponsibilities and the duty-of-care questions that may be asked by authorities should any form of accident or disaster overtake an expedition they have organised or sanctioned. Planning A brainstorming session with leaders and group members is a good idea in the planning stages of an expedition."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 90 Route plans All members of the group should have a copy of the route plan and should be aware of any hazardous sections and ensure all maps are current and accurate Leaders If there is a leader appointed they should be competent in all skills required for the trip. Assistant leaders must be experienced enough to safely care for the party should something unforeseen happen to the leader. Leaders and a ssistant leaders should be conversant with the area in which the expedition is conducted. Medical limitations Any medical condition suffered by any member of the group or any limiting personal factors or disabilities must be known to the leader prior to commencing the expedition. Actions-on and safety In the interests of safety ‘actions-on’ should be set for all foreseeable emergency situations and all members of the group should know the ag reed emergency procedures. An individual emergency procedure card can be printed and issued. Escape routes and actions should be set prior to departure and must be known to all members of the group. Notifications Notifications need to be posted prior to depa rture and cancelled on return and Police in the area of the walk notified. Police in Western Australia receive training in bushcraft and survival skills and it is a good practice to discuss your plans with them. Note: If a walker or group is lost the nearest police should be notified immediately as it is the role of police to organise land search operations in Western Australia. PRINCIPLES OF MINIMUM IMPACT CAMPING With the rise in popularity of outdoor recreation ha s come an increasing risk of damage to the natural environment. Fortunately along with the increasing number of walkers a new bushwalking ethic has also developed. The minimum impact philosophy is now being widely adopted for bushwalking and expeditioning in Western Australia. Campsites Look for low impact campsites, sandy or hard surfaces are better than boggy or vegetated areas. Where possible camp at an existing camps ite rather than creating a new one. If a campsite does not exist camp at least 50 metres away from watercourses and the track. Spend only one or two nights at such a campsite. W ith modern camping equipment you should leave a campsite looking as if you have never been there. Fireplaces Use only existing and safe fireplaces and rememb er that compared to campfires fuel stoves are faster, cleaner and a lot easier to use in we t weather. If you need to use a fire for cooking or warmth use an existing fireplace. Collect only deadwood and keep the fire small and manageable. Note: Be aware of fire bans and how they relate to the use of stoves."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 91 Washing-up Remember that detergents, toothpaste and soap [even biodegradable types] harm fish and water life. Wash 50 metres away from lakes and streams and scatter the wash water so that it will filter through the soil before returning to the stream. Avoid putting food scraps into streams or lakes. Do not wash-up directly under the tap of a rainwater tank. Under no circumstances wash in stock troughs on pastoral properties. Rubbish disposal Pack to minimise rubbish and avoid carryi ng potential rubbish such as bottles, cans and excess wrappings. Do not burn, bash or bury rubbish as this disturbs the soil and the rubbish is likely to be dug up and scattered by animals. Carry out all your rubbish. Note: If you come across other people's rubbish pick that up too. Toilets Where there is a toilet please use it, in areas without toilets bury your faecal waste. Choose a spot at least 100 metres away from camp-s ites and watercourses and dig a hole 15cm deep within the soil’s organic layer [a hand trowel is useful for this] and bury all faecal waste. FOOD AND COOKING The need for a balanced diet becomes increasi ngly important as the length of an expedition increases. For journeys lasting up to four or five days following normal eating habits will ensure that the diet is adequately balanced. Probably too much thought is given to achieving variety in the menu instead of paying more attention to the need to maintain an adequate intake of liquids, especially in hot weather. Considerably more energy than usual will be expended during a camping expedition, and so more food will need to be eaten to maintain a balance. Planning menus for bushwalking expeditions When planning a menu a balance needs to be ach ieved where you will need to remember that since the food will have to be carried too much will add unnecessary weight to the load. If too little food is taken then the group will go hungry and the efficiency of the group may be impaired. The prime need is to pack as much energy into the smallest possible weight and volume. Increasing the amount of carbohydrates and fats and by using dehydrated, freeze dried and canned food usually achieves this. Supermarkets carry an endless variety of dehydrated foods and freeze dried meals so if there is a plentiful supply of water there is no need to carry the extra weight of canned food. The packaging of such products is good, they are qui ck to prepare and usually only require the addition of water. Check how long the food take s to cook and wherever possible choose those that cook in the shortest possible time. Only carry the foods you like and enjoy and k eep all meals uncomplicated and simple to prepare, meals such as soups, stews, casseroles and pasta dishes are ideal. To ensure that you drink sufficiently especially in hot weather always carry more tea, coffee, milk and sugar than you think you will need. Fruit flavoured drink powders and cordials are also useful."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 92 Breakfast Bushwalking diet is very much a matter of individual preference and the most important consideration is to make it right for you. Most bushwalkers begin the day with a substa ntial breakfast and no day would be complete without it. Others prefer to do without washing up greasy pans and prefer cereals or muesli that only requires the addition of hot or cold milk followed by biscuits or bread and jam. Lunch Lunches do not usually play an important part in most bushwalkers dietary routine and a little and often is the rule. Cheese and biscuits or bisc uits with some spread such as jam or peanut butter are popular as are nuts and dried fruit s upplemented with chocolate or sweets. These are a concentrated form of energy and can be eaten on the move. Others prefer sandwiches and fresh fruit. Dinner The evening meal is usually the main meal of the day and even when limited to one stove and two or three pans it is possible with a little prac tice to prepare a hot, filling three course meal in a very short time. A typical meal might consist of a soup, stew, ca sserole or pasta dish followed by dessert [hot or cold] or cheese with biscuits and coffee. A visit to the local supermarket will reveal a great variety of dehydrated meats, textured vegetable protein, soybean, potato, peas and ot her vegetables, pre-cooked rice, noodles and various pastas and instant soups. There is also a wide selection of whips, mousses and instant desserts that require the addition of cold water or milk and preparations that only require hot milk to turn them into nourishing desserts. Note: Plan your menu ahead and experiment with different foods by cooking and eating them at home. Preparing a meal When the tent has been pitched and you are ready to prepare your meal, lay out all the ingredients and allocate the pans in which they are to be cooked. Some prefer to cook a course, eat it while it is hot and then prepare the next course. Others prepare the whole meal and then eat it. Whichever you choose it is essential to economise on the use of fuel and this can be done by planning the order in which the food is cooked and eaten. After the preparation of the main course wate r can be boiled for washing up and for coffee or tea. After the meal the experienced camper w ill wash up, tidy up, and pack away gear that will not be needed during the night."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 93 WAPA RATION PACK – 8 HOUR FOR 1 PERSON These ration packs are produced and issued by the Command and Land Operations Unit at the Western Australia Police Academy and are av ailable in two menus and both have been designed to ensure food and vitamin needs are sufficient to meet daily requirements when involved in practical activities in the outdoors.

This does not mean buying the most expensive, but seeking the advice of those e xperienced in the outdoors and then making the right choices. Many authorities have pools of camping equipment that may be borrowed or hired. It is a good idea to do this as it gives you an opportunity to test and gain experience of a variety of equipment before buying your own. All walkers should have their own clothing, we t weather gear, personal items and emergency equipment. It is desirable that all should eventually have their own pack and sleeping bag. Use of check lists Walkers should make a checklist of equipment when they prepare for their first journey. This list should be kept in a notebook and used to check equipment before departure on any future walks. With all the items that need to be carried it is easy to forget one item that may turn out to be vital. The list should be made under the headings of personal clothing, personal and emergency equipment, personal camping equipment and group camping equipment. Personal clothing Clothing must be capable of protecting you under the worst conditions that may be encountered. The rapidly changing conditions a nd the unpredictability of these changes makes the problem of choosing suitable clothing all th e more difficult. The solution lies in carrying extra clothing and then adding or removing laye rs according to the weather and the amount of physical exertion being undertaken. Insulation is provided by the air trapped between th e fibres of the cloth and between the layers of garments. Therefore two light jumpers we ighing 500 grams each provide more insulation than a heavier jumper weighing a kilogram. Th ere is also the added advantage that you can wear one only and regulate your temperature. Clothing loses most of its insulating qualities when wet. Whether the soaking comes from rain or from perspiration it is essential to keep cl othing as dry as possible. This means reducing sweating when working hard by opening or removing clothing and wearing waterproof clothing when it is raining hard. There are se veral materials that retain much of their insulating properties when wet, one is wool and another is synthetic fibre-pile. A mixture of wool and synthetic fibre is usually more suited to bushwalking. Whatever fabrics are used it is customary to have an inner layer of clothing to absorb perspiration, a middle layer to provide insulation and an outer layer to keep the wind and wet weather out. Garments should be loose fitting either to trap ai r or allow it to circulate as the need arises. Outer layer garments should be controllable so it is possible to open them up or close air circulation down by fastenings at the cuffs, waist and neck."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 97 Footwear Boots should be light with flexible, cleated rubber, environmentally friendly soles thick enough to prevent sharp stones being felt a nd to absorb the pounding associated with bushwalking. The uppers should be made of leather, preferably in one piece with the smooth side out so that they can be polished. A sewn in tongue [bellows type] will prevent water getting in and a combination of D-rings and hooks will make it easier to put them on and take them off. When you buy boots always take the socks that you are going to use with the boots to wear when you try them on. Even light summer boots n eed breaking-in so wear them whenever possible and remember that liberal applications of a suitable wax preparation will help the process. Once boots are broken in regular applications of a suitable leather dressing after use is all that is required to keep them supple and waterproof. Many bushwalkers wear joggers and while thes e are adequate they do not offer protection from water and sharp stones or give ankle support. Joggers are often carried as spare footwear and are useful around camp. Thongs are not recommended. Note: Never borrow boots and always seek advice before buying new ones. Socks Socks have to cushion the feet, absorb perspi ration and provide insulation. Socks specifically designed for bushwalking are recommended. Frequent washing is necessary. Underwear This is largely personal preference although pur e cotton is often the better choice. Thermal underwear is popular in cold conditions. Shirts Tee-shirts are popular but they do not have a colla r to shield the neck from the sun. A ‘polo’ type shirt with a collar is better. Tank tops and singlets are not suitable for bushwalking as they expose the shoulders to the sun. They also encourage chafing and rubbing from the pack. In colder conditions long sleeved flannelette or wool mixture shirts are effective and are usually good value for money. In hot conditions a cotton shirt with a collar and long sleeves is recommended. Trousers Trousers should be loose fitting and suited to bushwalking and for this reason cotton army- type pants are popular. Denim jean s are generally unsuitable as they are usually cut too tight, give little protection in wind and rain, become heavy when wet and take a long time to dry. Headgear In the warmer months some form of sun hat is e ssential. It must have a wide brim and as well as giving protection to the head and face it should also give some protection to the neck. In the cold much body heat is lost through the head a nd it is essential to protect the head to stay warm. A wool or synthetic ‘beanie’ or balaclava is recommended. Gaiters Specially designed bushwalking gaiters help k eep the feet dry in bad weather and when conditions are soggy underfoot. They also save the lower legs from being scratched, keep grass seeds out of socks and boots and give protection from snakebite."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 98 Wet weather clothing A waterproof jacket provides an outer she ll that protects against the elements. Being waterproof, condensation is inevitable and the clothing underneath is bound to become wet through perspiration so these garments should not be worn continually but carried in the pack and only worn when required. Rain jackets made out of fabrics that ‘breathe ’ can overcome this problem. A jacket with full zip is preferable and a storm flap should prot ect the zip. The jacket must be large enough to accommodate all the clothing you are likely to wear underneath and long enough to come well down over the hips almost to the knees. A hood, unde rarm vents, adjustable cuffs and a waist draw-cord will provide maximum control of air circulation. Waterproof trousers should be able to be put on over boots and it is essential to ensure that they are wide enough in the leg or have zips at the ankles. Gore-Tex fabric Essentially a water repellent, protective outer nylon shell glued to a highly breathable membrane of expanded Teflon. With three layer Gore -Tex fabric there is another layer of fine mesh bonded to the inside of the garment that protects the Teflon laminate from the inside and increases the rigidity and durability of the fa bric. Because of its expansion process the laminate has more than a billion microscopic pores per square centimetre. Each of them is big enough to let water vapour [perspiration] out but too small to let water droplets [rain] in. The result is an extremely durable fabric that is waterproof, windproof and breathable. Helly-Tech fabric A waterproof, breathable fabric that works usi ng a combination of very durable micro-porous and hydrophilic coatings. The coating next to the wearer’s body is the hydrophilic layer which serves two functions: it draws water away from the insulating layers closest to the body towards the external environment and also pr otects the micro-porous layer between it and the outside shell from body oils and other contam inants. The micro-porous layer forms a highly moisture permeable matrix that binds the she ll fabric and the hydrophilic coating. The type of face fabric used is also important to the overall performance of Helly-Tech fabric. Mont Hydronaute fabric A water repellent nylon face fabric coated with a hydrophilic polyurethane compound that maintains a waterproof, windproof and breatha ble barrier between the wearer and the elements. The latest generation Hydronaute fabric also has a fine mesh bonded to the inside of the garment to improve durability. PERSONAL & EMERGENCY EQUIPMENT Along with the clothing that will be worn or ca rried in the pack there are a small number of items of emergency equipment that should alwa ys be carried by every member of the party. The amount of equipment should be kept to the barest minimum or the exercise becomes self- defeating as the increased weight leads to fatigue. Essential items Spare clothing may range from a spare jumper and socks for a day journey to complete changes of clothing for a campi ng expedition. All group members should carry a small torch, spare bulb, batteries and waterproof matches. A plastic whistle should be carried as well as a pencil and notebook. Emergency Rations, Personal Survival and First-aid Kits Chocolate, nuts and dried fruit are a good source of energy and a quantity should be carried as emergency rations. A personal survival kit and personal first aid kit should also be carried."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 99 INDIVIDUAL CAMPING EQUIPMENT Expedition packs Your pack should be large enough to hold a ll your equipment and suit your needs. A tough cordura or canvas is suitable and you should try the pack on fully loaded paying particular attention to the waist belt, shoulder straps a nd harness adjustability. Shoulder straps should be wide and well padded. To take some of th e weight off your shoulders a well-padded adjustable hip belt is essential. Modern p acks have adjustable back lengths and are ergonomically designed with an internal frame that allows natural body movement. Single Compartment Expedition Pack This type of expedition pack is a rugged, simple expedition pack designed for schools, outdoors clubs, youth organisations, equipment pools and hire agencies. It is generally is made from canvas and cordura in 55lt, 60lt and 65lt capacity. They are fitted with an adjustable harness system and weigh approximately 2kg. The bag features have generally been chosen primarily for minimum maintenance, and lifetime economy. A throat is avoided by cutti ng the main bag high. They have a simple, laddered and lined lid and highly effective back pocket that completely eliminates zips. The natural wet weather performance of these ca nvas packs is good insurance against novice users having to suffer the consequences of wet gear. Twin Compartment Expedition Pack A twin compartment pack whose capacity and comfort simplifies the load carrying problems of ambitious bushwalkers when factors like th e need to carry fresh water, additional food, cold weather clothing or specialised equipment arise. These are usually made from canvas and cordura in 80lt, 90lt and 95lt capacity. They are fitted with an adjustable harness system and weigh approximately 2.5kg The zippered access into the lower part of the pack is useful when early starts and long days limit the opportunities to dry damp sleeping bags and other gear normally stowed low in the pack. The zip is usually curved to facilitate access and located low enough on the pack so as to not restrict back-pocket capacity. A si mple, yet strong shelf separates the two compartments. Spaces each side of this shelf allo w long items such as tent arch sets to be stored inside the bag. In some the compartment divider can be dropped down converting the pack to a single compartment configuration. Sleeping bags It is impossible for one sleeping bag to cope w ith all extremes and most bushwalkers settle for an all-season bag. Outer material is usually downproof rip-stop nylon with the inner made from nylon. In between there is a synthetic fibre filling that provides very high thermal insulation for its weight. This fibre has an exceptional rebound factor allowing it to be compacted into a small space and is warmer than down filling when wet. An inner cotton or polyester bag must be used with hired or borrowed sleeping bags and they should be used in down bags to keep the bag clean. An inner bag also gives you more versatility in very hot weather as you can sleep in it on top of your sleeping bag. Sleeping mats A closed cell foam sleeping mat or self-inflating mattress is essential and as the foam does not absorb water they can be carried on the outside of the pack. Water Each member of the party should carry their own water and between one and four litres will be needed per day depending on local conditions."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 100 In-camp gear Each individual needs a plastic mug, a steel or plastic plate and cutlery. Toilet gear should include soap and towel, toothbrush and toilet paper. All members must carry rubbish bags. GROUP CAMPING EQUIPMENT Tents A tent is the typical symbol of camping, but it is much more than that. In the most extreme environments the correct selection of shelte r is often the most important decision you can make. Of course, even if it's not life or death and for most of us happily it is not, the right choice does make all the difference if you want to have an enjoyable time away from the comforts of home. There are dozens of lightweight tents availabl e for the bushwalker to choose from and they come in all shapes and sizes. Many authorities ha ve tents that they lend or hire out. Before you buy a tent borrow one of the same kind so you can examine the quality of construction and try it out for size and convenience. The tents used on expeditions usually hold two or three persons with the load being shared between the occupants. It is usual to have a breathable nylon or cotton inner with a waterproof nylon fly and a slightly heavier, waterproof nylon floor. If a borrowed tent is to be used, pitch it before the start of your venture to ensure it is complete and that you know how to erect it. Always return it complete and dry. The Dome Tent These are compact, easy to carry and usually have two diagonal tent poles with a vestibule. They are easy and fast to assemble and are be st fitted with pole clips. They are usually constructed with a waterproof polyester fly a nd waterproof nylon floor. Both the fly and floor should be tape seam sealed for immediate use. They are suitable for most camping and bushwalking expeditions in Western Australia. The Tunnel Tent This type of tent is recommended as a co mpact 2-person, ultra-lightweight, double-skinned, expedition tent with good ventilation. This tent is suitable for use in warm weather conditions as well as for travel in snow, across exposed c ountry and in severe weather. The design is a classic two arch tapered tunnel and careful atten tion has usually been paid to equalising skin stress over the outer tent surface and to a voiding unnecessarily large areas of unsupported fabric. While access into the tent is usually provided at each side of the main arch it is impractical to provide it at the small end. Both ends of the outer and inner can still be fully unzipped however for ventilation. Gear stowed under the vestibule should not hinder movement in and out of the tent. Cooking Stoves Cooking should be approached as an enjoyable part of expeditions and stoves need to be light and compact to carry in a pack and not too e xpensive. They should be simple to assemble, operate and clean. They should also require no sp ecial maintenance and be easy to light. Even in the harshest of weather conditions you need to be able to easily light the stove and successfully cook food or heat water in a short period of time. Stainless steel cooking pots, pans and kettles are recommended."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 101 Methylated Spirit Stove These stoves are very popular and serve a dual function of stove and cooking set. They are easy to light and there are no complicated ign ition devices. By turning the ventilation holes into the wind you optimise the oxygen supply to the burner, which increases the efficiency of the unit. These stoves are very stable with pots set deeply in the upper windshield. Handles, pots, kettles and a frypan, which doubles as a lid are included in the unit. Note: Remember that methylated spirit burns with an invisible flame in sunlight and care must be taken to ensure that the flame is completely extinguished and the burner cooled before refuelling.  The Trangia No.25-8 complete camping stove Multi Fuel Stove The multi fuel stove is ideally suited to extremes of weather and they usually have an extra flame control valve that allows immediate cont rol over a very broad range of temperatures. They are fully field maintainable, extremely compact, burn shellite, unleaded petrol, aviation fuel, diesel, and kerosene along with a few othe rs. The best are fitted with a ‘shaker’ jet for self-cleaning. Carrying liquid fuel Liquid fuel should only be carried in an Australian Standard approved bottle with a secure screw top. Portable Gas Stove These are extremely simple to operate and ar e favoured for day walks and situations where cooking needs are minimal. Features on the best of them include an automated match-less lighting system and specially designed burner grat es. They generally boil water in 3-5 minutes and usually burn for one hour on high or two hour s on low using a standard gas cartridge"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 102 EXPEDITION EQUIPMENT CHECK LIST Clothing Boots, joggers, socks, underwear, trousers, sh irts, jumpers, jacket, headgear, gloves, waterproof jacket and waterproof over-pants.

PACKING AND LOAD CARRYING Packs are rarely waterproof and experienced walkers solve this problem by using a heavy gauge plastic bag inside the pack as a waterp roof liner. In addition every item of clothing carried in the pack along with the sleeping ba g and the food should be protected individually by placing them inside plastic bags and sealing them. Pack weight Pack weights should not exceed a quarter of your body weight and the nearer this load is to your centre of gravity the less strain and fatigue it will impose on your body. Modern packs are designed to do this and you can assist by pl acing heavy items high up in your pack and as near to the body as possible. Considerable experience is needed to keep p ack weight to a minimum and to avoid anything but the essentials being carried. Inexperienced wa lkers are often inconsistent in their attitude to weight. Packs must always be weighed be fore departure and it is a good idea to keep placing them on the bathroom scales while you are gathering your equipment. In this way if items have to be eliminated it will not have to be done in a hurry before setting out. Packing is largely common sense but it is nece ssary to balance conflicting needs. Since the ‘last in - first out’ rule applies, items that w ill be needed en-route should be placed in the side pockets or at the top of the pack. Wet weather gear, spare clothes such as jumper, gloves or headgear and food that is to be eaten during the journey should be ready to hand. The sleeping bag and clothing that will not be needed duri ng the walk and which ar e bulky but lightweight should go to the bottom of the pack. Heavy items or shared group equipment such as the tent and stove should be divided equally between the occupants of the tent and can go into the pack next with the rest of the gear on top. Many problems arise from packing at the last moment and then throwing in whatever comes to hand. Forethought is required and your kit should be assembled well in advance for the expedition. Planning to do the job well always takes longer. Note: All gear other than sleeping mats should be carried inside the pack."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 103 CAMPCRAFT Camping improves with practice and the ability to provide food and shelter under all conditions is a skill worth acquiring. It will gi ve you confidence, satisfaction and enjoyment as well as allowing you to participate in other outdoor activities. Choosing a campsite Choosing the right campsite is not only importa nt for your comfort and enjoyment but can affect your wellbeing. Finding shelter from the wind and prevailing weather should always be uppermost in your mind when using a lightweight tent. This usually means seeking lower ground using hollows or the leeside of a ridge, hill or trees as a windbreak between your tent and where the wind or weather is coming from. Other factors to be considered when choosing a campsite include making sure it is free from hazards such as flooding, falling rocks or tree branches. Where possible make sure it is reasonably near to water and offers the prospect of a reasonable night's comfortable sleep. Note: Remember; 1600 hours [4 pm] is a good time to make camp, 1700 hours [5 pm] is running it a bit tight and 1800 hours [6pm] is leaving it too late. Pitching tents The ground under the tent needs to be as clear and level as possible. If there is a slope then it is best to sleep with your f eet down hill. The ground needs to be reasonably dry and soft enough to sleep on and to take tent pegs. Rem ove any object that might puncture the tent floor. Pegs need to be driven into the ground at an angle of 45º. Guy lines and pegs should be run out in line with the seams a nd heavier or larger pegs used for the main guys. If the ground is too soft then stones will need to be placed on top of the pegs. The tent should be pitched so the entrance faces away from the wind. Note: Tents should never be pitched under trees. Living in a tent When two or three people are living in a sma ll tent personal organisation and tidiness is essential. Campers should be prepared for th e worst with equipment no longer needed being restored to the pack. Everything should be in its place and torches handy before turning in. Sleep with your head to the door of the tent to allow easy exit in an emergency. Establishing a routine A routine should be established between the inha bitants of a tent and the question of who does what should be sorted out on reaching the cam psite. No matter how footsore and weary the group may be it is good practice to pitch the tent when reaching an overnight campsite. Daily Routine Morning   Afternoon   1. Wake party. 2. Light fires/set up stoves. 3. Take down and pack tents and shelters. 4. Attend to personal hygiene. 5. Breakfast. 6. Fill and check water containers/bottles. 7. Attend to first-aid and inspect feet. 8. Check and pack gear. 9. Conduct a group briefing and set off. 1. Lunch. 2. Check and pack gear. 3. Conduct a group briefing and set off. 4.

Write up track logs and journals."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 104 Cooking In dry weather cooking can take place in a sh eltered place away from the tent making access to the tent easier. In wet weather cooking shoul d be done outside the tent under the shelter of the flysheet or vestibule. There should never be any need to cook inside the tent. While one person, having removed boots and water-proof cl othing cooks in the shelter of the doorway the others in the group can ensure that ever ything needed for the meal and the washing up afterwards is within easy reach of the person doing the cooking. Note: Boots or outside footwear and wet clothing should not be worn inside the tent. The lightweight floor of the tent must be treated with great care. HYGIENE Hygiene is an important aspect of expeditions and camp discipline and personal cleanliness needs to remain at a high level. Face, hands a nd feet should be washed and teeth cleaned at the end of each day. Socks need to be washed fr equently and can be dried if the weather is fine by attaching them to the outside of the pack while walking. Water supplies must be kept clean and dirty washing up water should be poured into a hole made with a trowel in soft ground well away from the water source. Dirty or greasy water must never be thrown back into creeks or waterholes and personal washing should be done away from the source of drinking water. Do not wash-up or use soap in stock troughs. All litter must be removed from the campsite and carried out by the group. It is no longer acceptable to bash, burn and bury rubbish. Be prepared to remove your rubbish by carrying a few plastic garbage bags with you. WEATHER CONSIDERATIONS No matter how much information there may be on a weather map it must always be read with an eye to local geographic conditions. With a little experience it is possible to predict when it will be wise to stay and when it will be possible to venture out. Sky Signs For all the scientific tricks there may be up our modern sleeves, we still rely for local forecasting on some of the weather lore of our fore fathers. It is still true to say that a red or clear sky at sunset usually predicts a fine da y to follow, while a grey or dark cloudy evening or a diffuse watery sky suggests a wet or windy tomorrow. When clouds break up at sunrise, or the sun co mes up through haze into a clear sky, it usually heralds a fine day, but the early red sky or a col ourless sun, especially if there is a rainbow or halo around it, warns of rain and unsettled conditi ons. The larger the halo, the sooner the rain will arrive. The behaviour of the barometer should not be neglected when making such judgements. Behaviour Of The Barometer Rapid falls in pressure always precede rain a nd storms, and maybe a change in wind direction, squalls or the imminent arrival of a cold front . If at the same time the temperature is above normal and the humidity high or rising, unsettled weather and rain are usually on the way. Once the change is past, cooler and clearer weather will follow. When the barometer steadies and begins to rise, clearing weather comes quite rapidly. Remember however that any really rapid rise in barometric pressure after bad weather can bring wind and unstable conditions instead of the expected fine weather."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"AIDS TO SURVIVAL 105 When the barometer begins to fall slowly after a spell during which it was steady, the area is likely to be visited by unsettled and wet weat her, and a halo round the sun or moon will usually confirm that forecast. No matter how l ong it stays fine as the barometer goes lower, it is certain wind and rain will eventually come. Usually a high barometric reading brings settled conditions. WEATHER PATTERNS IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA It is possible by examining weather patterns over a period of time to predict the kind of weather that may be experienced at any particul ar time of the year. But even when it is based on an average of the statistics remember that such forecasting is never infallible. January – February - March Western Australia is so extensive it samples a ll possible climates except perhaps alpine. In January, low-pressure troughs bring hot continenta l winds. February brings great contrasts in rainfall, with occasional tropical cyclones and hea vy rain. Apart from these, the month is quite dry, but the humidity can be high. The rainfall is heavier in March, but mainly in the north where there is a risk of rivers flooding. April - May The high-pressure belt begins to drift northward in April, and westerly winds become more general in the southwest. The rainfall also increases. The increase continues through May, when the westerlies become more general, with a few fogs developing. June The high pressure belt continues to drift nor thward through June and it brings the low pressure systems closer to the coast in the s outh, increasing the rainfall still more until it is the heaviest of any month in the year, especially near the south coast. July - August July is the coldest month of the year in the state. There are occasional gales and flooding in the southwest, but elsewhere there is genera lly a noticeable decrease in rainfall. The high- pressure systems begin to move southward in A ugust, but the weather remains similar to that of July. In the north it is the driest month of th e year, but it is still fairly wet in the southwest, with occasional flooding. September – October - November In September, the low-pressure systems are mo re southerly, and the winds move westerly in both the north and south, but easterly in central coastal areas. There are likely to be some gales in the southwest, but little rain. The belt of high pressure systems moves farther south in October, and by November is in southern wa ters, but occasionally it moves north enough to bring westerly winds and showers. December There can be cyclones during this month and th ese are even more likely in the north-west when there are low-pressure systems in th e Bight, and easterly winds farther north. The tropical areas have more westerly winds and much more cloud at this time, but it remains hot. Summary On the whole, Western Australian weather is under the influence of a belt of high-pressure systems that crosses the north of the State in winter and brings fine weather so long as it remains. This belt drifts southwards for summe r and takes it’s fine weather with it. Cyclones form from the low-pressure systems that move in to fill the area left."}]
