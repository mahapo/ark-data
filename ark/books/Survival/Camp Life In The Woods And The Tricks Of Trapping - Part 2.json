It is of a tawny red color and nearly as large as the grey species, possessing the same savage nature. In April or May the female wolf re tires to her burrow or den, and her young, from six to ten in number, are brought forth. The wolf is almost as sly and cunning as the fox, and the same caution is required in trapping the animal. They ar e extremely keen scented, and the mere touch of a human hand on the trap is ofte n enough to preclude the possibility of capture. A mere footprint, or the scen t of tobacco juice, they look upon with great suspicion, and the presence of either will often prevent success. The same directions given in regard to trapping the fox are equally adapted for the wolf. The trap (size No, 4, page 141 ) should be smoked or smeared with beeswax or blood, and set in a bed of ashes or othe r material as therein described, covering with moss , chaff, leaves or some other light substance. The clog should be fully twice as heavy as th at used for the fox. Some trappers rub the traps with \"brake leaves,\" sweet fern, or even skunk's cabbage. Gloves should always be worn in handling the traps, and all tracks should be obliterated as much as if a fox were th e object sought to be secured. A common way of securing the wolf consists in setting the trap in a spring or puddle of water, throwing the dead body of some large animal in the water beyond the trap in such a position that th e wolf will be obli ged to tread upon the trap, in order to reach the bait. This method is descri bed both under the head of the Fox and the Bear. Another plan is to fasten the bait between two trees which are very close together, setting a trap on each side and carefully c oncealing them as already directed, and securing each to a clog of about twenty pounds in weight. The enclosure described on page 144 is also successful. There are various scent or trail baits used in tr apping the wolf. Oil of Assaf≈ìtida is by many trappers consid ered the best, but Oil of Rhodium, powdered fennel, fenugreek and Cummin Oil are also much used. It is well to smear a little of the first me ntioned oil near the traps, using any one of the other substances, or indeed a mixt ure of them all, for the tr ail. This may be made by smearing the preparation on the sole of th e boots and walking in the direction of the traps, or by dragging from one trap to another a piece of meat scented with the substance, as described under the head of Mink. The wolf is an adept at feigning deat h, playing \"'possum\" with a skill which would do credit to that veritable animal itself. A large dead-fall, constructed of logs, page 17 , when skilfully scented and baited, will often allu re a wolf into its clutches, and a very strong twitch-up, with a noose formed of heavy wire , or a strip of stout calf hide, will successfully capture the crafty creature. In skinning the wolf the hide may be removed either by, first ripping up the belly, or in a circular pi ece, as described connection with the fox, both methods being much used. The board and hoop stretchers used in preparing the skin are described on p a g es 273 and 275 .

The puma, commonly known also as the panther or cougar, is the largest American representative of the Cat tribe, and for this reason is often dignified by the name of the \"American Lion.\" It is found more or less abundantly throughout the United States; and although not gene rally considered a dangerous foe to mankind, it has often been know n in the wild districts to steal upon the traveller unawares, and in many instances human beings have fallen a prey to the powerful claws and teeth of this powerful animal. The life of the puma is mostly in the trees. Crouching upon the branches it watches for, or steals, cat-like, upon its prey. Should a so litary animal pass within reach, the puma will not he sitate in pouncing upon the unfortunate creature; but if a herd of animals, or pa rty of men, should be travelling together, the caution of the brute asserts itself, a nd he will often dog th eir footsteps for a great distance, in hopes of securing a straggler. Birds ar e struck down by a single blow of the puma's ready paw, and so quick are his movements that even though a bird has risen on the wing, he can of ten make one of hi s wonderful bounds, and with a light, quick stroke, arrest the winged prey before it has time to soar beyond reach. The puma is a good angler. Sitting by the wa ter's edge he watches for his victims, and no soone r does an unfortunate fish swim within reach, than the nimble paw is outstretched, and it is swept out of the water on dry land, and eagerly devoured. A puma has been known to follow the track of travellers for days together, only daring to show itself at rare intervals, and neve r endeavoring to make an attack except through stealth. The animal will often approa ch cautiously upon a traveller until sufficiently near to make its fatal spring; but if the pursued party suddenly turn round and face the cr awling creature, the beast becomes discomfited at once, and wi ll retreat from the gaze which seems to it a positive terror. So long as a puma can be kept in sight, no danger need be feared from the animal but it will improve every oppor tunity of springi ng unobservedly upon a heedless passer by. The total length of the puma is six feet and a half, of which the tail occupies a little over two feet. Its color is of a uniform light tawny tint, fading into light grey on the under parts, and the tip of the tail is black. The puma is one of the few members of the Cat tribe, which are without the usual spots or stripes so observable in the tiger and leopard. Th e lion has the same uniformity of color, a nd it is perhaps partly on that account that the panther is so often known as the Americ an lion. In infancy the young pumas possess decided tiger-like markings, and leopa rd-like spots, but these di sappear altogether as the animal increases in size. The cougar ha s learned by experience a wholesome fear of man, and as civilization has exte nded throughout our country, the animals have been forced to retir e from the neighborhood of hum an habitations and hide themselves in thick, uncul tivated forest lands. Sometimes, however, the animal, urge d by fierce hunger, will venture on a marauding expedition for seve ral miles, and although not an object of personal dread to the inhabitants, he often beco mes a pestilent nei ghbor to the farmer, committing great ravages am ong his flocks and herds, and making sad havoc in his poultry yard. It is not the fortune of every puma, however, to reside in the nei g hborhood of such eas y p re y as p i g s, shee p and p oultr y , and the g reater Pa g e 162 Pa g e 122 of 240 Cam p Life in the Woods and the Tricks of Tra pp in g and Tra p Makin g 11/01/2006 file://C:\\Documents and Settin g s\\Stuart Gorin g \\M y Documents\\Cam p Life in the Woo..."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"number of these animals are forced to depend for their subsistence on their own success in chasing or surprising th e various animals on which they feed. When a puma is treed by hunter s, it is said to show great skill in selecting a spot wherein it shall be best concealed from the gazers below, and will even draw the neighboring branch es about its body to hide it self from the aim of the hunter's rifle. While thus lying upon the br anches the beast is almost invisible from below, as its fur, when seen, ha rmonizes so well with the the bark which covers the boughs, that the one can scarcel y be distinguished from the other. The puma loves to hide in the branches of trees, and from this eminence to launch itself upon the doomed animal that may pass within it s reach. It may, therefore, be easily imagined how trea cherous a foe the creature may be when ranging at will among the countless trees a nd jungles of our American forests. Although so stealthy and sl y a creature the cougar po ssesses very little cunning and is easily trapped. The Gun trap, page 20 , is commonly and successfully employed in South America in the capture of the jaguar, as our title illustration, page 15 , represents, and it may also be used with the same success in trapping the puma. The Bow trap, page 23 , and the dead-fall describe d in the early part of the book, will all be found to work admi rably in the destruction of this treacherous beast. The animal may be entrapped alive, s hould any of our young trappers dare to try the experiment. There are two ways of accomplishing this . The first is by the aid of a huge coop of logs, as described on page 30 or 33 , and the other by the Pit-fall, as exemplified on page 31 .

The lynx represents another of the Cat tribe, and as its name implies is a native of the regions north of the United States, although some times found in upper Maine and on the lower borders of th e great lakes. It is commonly known throughout Canada as the Peshoo, or \"Le Chat.\" Our illustration is a truthful represen tation of the animal. Its total length exceeds three feet, and its tail is a mere stub. The fur is thick, and the hairs are long, the general color being grey, sprinkled with blac k. The legs are generally darker than the body, and the ears are of ten edged with white. The limbs and muscles are very powerful, the paws are very large fo r the size of the animal, and are furnished with strong white claws, which are imbedded in the fur of the feet when not in use, th ey are shown in our illust ration. The ears of the lynx form a distinct feature, by which the anim al could be easily identified; they are long and tipped with stif f projecting hairs, givi ng the creature a very odd appearance. The peshoo can not be said to be a very dangerous animal, unl ess it is attacked, when it becomes a most ferocious anta gonist. The writer knew of a gentleman who was pounced upon and very nearly k illed by one of these infuriated creatures, and there are many like instances on record. The principal food of the lynx consis ts of the smaller quadrupeds, the American hare being its favorite article of diet. It is a good swimmer, and a most agile climber, chasing its prey among the branches with great stealth and dexterity. Like the wolf, fox, and many other flesh eating-animals, the lynx does not content itself with the creatures which fall by the stroke of its own talons, or the grip of its own teeth, but will follow the trail of the puma, in its nocturnal quest after prey, and thankfully partak e of the feast which remains after its predecessor has satisfied its appetite. While running at full speed, the lynx pr esents a most ludicrous appearance, owing to its peculiar manner of leaping. It progresses in su ccessive bounds, with its back slightly arched, a nd all the feet striking the ground nearly at the same instant. Powerful as the animal is, it is easily killed by a bl ow on the back, a slight stick being a sufficie nt weapon wherewith to dest roy the creature.

The dead-fall should of course be constructed on a large scale, and it is a good plan to have the enclosure deep, and the ba it as far back as will necessitate the animal being well under the suspended log in order to reach it. The bait may consist of a dead quadrupe d or of fresh meat of any kind. The Gun trap, page 20 , and the Bow trap, page 23 , will also be found efficient, and a very powerful twitch-up, construc ted from a stout pol e and extra strong wire will also serve to good purpose. The lynx is not so prolif ic as many of the feline tribe, the number of its young se ldom exceeding two, and this only once a year. The fur of the animal is valuable for the purposes to which the feline skin is generally adapted, and commands a fa ir price in the ma rket. Those who hunt or trap the lynx will do well to choose the winter months for the time of their operations, as during the cold season the animal possesses a thicker and warmer fur than it offers in the summer months. When the steel trap is use d, it should be of size No. 4, page 141 , set at the opening of a pen of stakes, the bait being placed at the back of the enclosure in such a position, as that the animal will be obliged to step upon the pan of the trap in order to reach it. Any of the devices described under \"Hints on Baiting\" will be found successful. The skin of the animal may be removed as directed in the case of the fox, being drawn off the body whol e, or it may be remove d after the manner of the beaver, and simila rly stretched. THE WILD CAT. This animal is one of the most wide-s pread species of the Cat tribe, being found not only in America, but throughout near ly the whole of Europe as well as in Northern Asia.

Many naturalists are of the opinion that the wild cat is the original progenitor of our domestic cat, but there is much di fference of opinion in regard to the subject. Although they bear great resembla nce to each other, there are several points of distinction between the two; one of the most decided differences being in the comparative length of the tails. The ta il of the wild cat is little more than half the length of that of the dom estic cat, and much more bushy. The color of the wild animal is much more uniform th an in the great raft of \"domestic\" mongrel specimens which make night hideous with their discordant yowls, although we sometimes see a high br ed individual which, if his tail was cut off at half its length, might easily pa ss as an example of the wild variety. The ground tint of the fur in the wild ca t is yellowish grey, diversified with dark streaks over the body and limbs, much afte r the appearance of the so-called \"tiger cat.\" A row of dark streaks and sp ots extends along the spine, and the tail is thick, short and bushy, ti pped with black and encircled with a number of rings of a dark hue. In some individuals the markings are less dis tinct, and they are sometimes altogether wanting, but in the typical wild ca t they are quite prominent. The fur is rather long and th ick, particularly so during the winter season, and always in the colder northern regions. The amount of havoc which these creatu res often occasion is surprising, and their nocturnal inroads, in poultry yards and sheep folds, render them most hated pests to farmers in the countries where these animals abound. They seem to have a special appetite for the heads of fowls, and will of ten decapitate a half dozen in a single night, leaving the bodies in otherwise good condition to tell the story of their midnight murder s. The home of the wild ca t is made in some cleft of rock, or in the hollow of some aged tr ee, from which the creature issues in the dark hours and starts upo n its marauding excursions. Its family numbers from three to six, and the female parent is sma ller than the male, the total length of the latter being three feet.

At night, like its domestic relative, he prowls far and wide, walking with the same stealthy step and hunting his game in the same tiger-like manner. He is by no means a difficu lt animal to trap, being easily deceived a nd taking a bait without an y hesitation. The wild cat haunts the shores of lakes a nd rivers, and it is here th at the traps may be set for them. Having caught and killed one of the colony, the rest of them can be easily taken if the body of the dead victim be left near their hunting ground and surrounded with the traps carefully set a nd concealed beneath leaves moss or the like. Every wild cat that is in the neighborhood will be certain to visit the body, and if the traps are rightly arranged many will be caught. The trap No. 3, page 141 is generally used. We w ould caution the young trapper in his approach to an entrapped wild cat, as the strength and ferocity of this animal under such circumstances, or when otherwise \"hard pressed,\" is perfectly amazing. When caught in a trap they spring with terrible fury at any one who approaches them, not waiting to be assailed, and when cornered or he mmed in by a hunter they will often turn upon their pursuer, and springing at his face will atta ck him with most consummate fury, often inflicti ng serious and sometimes fatal wounds. When hunted and attacked by dogs, the wild cat is a mo st desperate and untiring fighter, and extremely diffic ult to kill, for which reas on it has been truthfully said that \"if a tame cat has nine lives, a wild cat must have a dozen.\" The twitch-up, erected on a large scale, is utilized to a considerable extent in England in the capture of these animals; and these, together with steel traps and dead-falls, are about the only machines us ed for their capture. We would suggest the garrote, bow and gun trap also as bei ng very effective. Th e bait may consist of the head of a fowl or a piece of rabbit or fowl flesh: or, indeed, flesh of almost any kind will answer, partic ularly of the bird kind. In skinning the wild cat th e same directions given under the head of the Fox may be followed, or the pelt may be ri pped up the belly and spread on a hoop stretcher, page 275 . THE BEAR. There are several species of the Bear tribe which inhabit our continent, the most prominent of which are the Griz zly, and the Musquaw or common Black Bear. There is no other animal of this country which is more widely and deservedly dreaded than the grizzly b ear. There are other creatures, the puma and wild cat, for instance, which are da ngerous when corner ed or wounded, but they are not given to open and delibera te attack upon human beings. The grizzly, however, or \"Ephraim,\" as he is commonl y termed by trappers , often displays a most unpleasant readiness to attack and pur sue a man, even in the face of fire arms. In many localities, however, where hunting has been pursued to considerable extent, thes e animals have learned fr om experience a wholesome fear of man, and are not so ready to assume the offensive, but a \" wounded \" grizzly is one of the mo st horrible antagonists of which it is possible to conceive, rushing upon its victim with terrible fury, and dealing most tearing and heavy blows with its huge claws. In length this formidable animal often exceeds eight feet, an d its color varies from yellowish to brownish black, and some specimens are found of a dirty grey color.

The fore limbs of the animal are immensely powerful; and the foot of a full-grown individual is full y eighteen inches long, and armed with claws five inches in length. The grizzl y inhabits the Rocky Mountain regions and northward, being found in considerab le numbers in the western part of British America. Its hair is thick a nd coarse, except in the young animal, which possesses a beautiful fur. All other creatures seem to stand in fear of this formidable beast. Even the huge bison, or buffalo, of the Western Prai ries sometimes falls a victim to the grizzly bear, and the very imprint of a bear's foot upon the soil is a warning which not even a hungry wolf will disregard. Its food consists of whatev er animal it can seize, wh ether human or otherwise. He also devours green corn, nuts, and fruits of all kinds. In his earlier years he is a good climber, and will as cend a tree with an agilit y which is surprisingly inconsistent with the unwieldy proportions of his body. The average weight of a full-grown grizzly is over eight hundred pounds, and the girth around the body is about eight feet. The Black bear, or Musquaw, which we illustrate is common throughout nearly all the half settled- districts of North America. But as the fur and fat are articles of great commercial value, the hunters and trap pers have exercised their craft with such skill and determination that the animals are gradually decreasing in numbers. The total length of the black bear is seldom more than six feet, and its fur is smooth and glossy in appearance. The color of the animal is rightly conveyed by its name, the cheeks only pa rtaking of a reddish fawn color. It possesses little of th at fierceness which charac terizes the grizzly, being naturally a very quiet and retiring crea ture, keeping itself aloof from mankind, and never venturing near his habitations except when excited by the pangs of fierce hunger. When pursued or cornered it becomes a dangerous antagonist; and its furious rage often resu lts in fearful catastrophe s to both man and beast. Nothing but a rifle ball in the right spot will check the cr eature, when wrought up to this pitch of fury, and an addi tional wound only serves to increase its terrible ferocity. Bear-chasi ng is an extremely dangerous sport; and there are few bear-hunters in the land, how ever skilful, but what can show scars from the claws or teeth of some exasperated bruin. The food of the black bear is mostly of a vegetable character , animal diet not being indulged in unless pressed by hunger. At such times it seems to especially prefer a young pig as the most desirable de licacy; and even full-grown hogs, it is said, are sometimes lifted from their pens and carried off in his deadly embrace. Honey is his especial delight ; and he will climb trees wi th great agility in order to reach a nest of bees, there being few obstacles which his ready claws and teeth will not remove where that dainty is in view. He is also very fond of acorns, berries, and fruits of all kinds. The young of the bear are produced in Ja nuary or February, and are from one to four in number.

The flesh of the bear is held in high esteem among hunters, and when properl y prepared is greatly esteemed by epicures. The fat of the animal is much used unde r the title of \"Bear grease,\" and is believed to be an infallible hair rejuvenator, and th erefore becomes a valuable article of commerce. The bear generally hibernates during the winter, choosing some comfortable residence which it has prepared in the c ourse of the summer, or perhaps betaking itself to the hollow of some tree. Sometime s, in case of early snow, the track of the bears may be distinguished, and if foll owed will probably lead to their dens, in which they can be secured with logs until it is desired to kill them. The black bear has a habit of treading in a beaten track, which is easily detected by the eye of an experienced hunter or trapper, and turned to good account in trapping the animal. There are various modes of accomplishing this resu lt. The bear Dead-fall, described on page 17 , is, perhaps, the most commonly used, and the Pit-fall, page 31 , and \"Giant Coop\" trap are also ex cellent. The Gun trap and stone dead- fall, page 20 , we also confidently recommend. When a steel trap is used it requires the largest size, especially made for the purpose. It should be supplied with a short and very strong chain firm ly secured to a very heavy clog or grappling-iron page 147 . If secured to a tree or other stat ionary object, the captured animal is likely to gnaw or tear his foot away, if, indeed, he does not break the trap altogether by the quick ti ghtening of the chain. The clog should be only heavy enough to be an impediment , and may consist of a log or heavy stone. The grappling-iron, however, is more often used in connection with the bear trap. It is a common method in trapping the bear to construct a pen of upright branches, laying the trap at its opening, and covering it with leaves. The bait is then placed at the back in such a position that the animal, on reaching for it, will be sure to put his foot in the trap.

Any arrangemen t whereby the bear will be obliged to tread upon the trap in order to secure the bait, is, of course, all that is required. The bait may be hung on the edge of a ro ck five feet from the ground, and the trap set on a smaller rock be neath it. He will thus be almost sure to rest his forefoot on the latter rock in order to re ach the bait, and will thus be captured. Another way is to set the trap in a spri ng of water or swampy spot. Lay a lump of moss over the pan, susp ending the bait beyond the tr ap. The moss will offer a natural foot-rest, and the offe nding paw will be secured. Bears possess but little cunning, and will enter any nook or corner without the slightest compunction when in quest of f ood. They are especially fond of sweets, and, as we have said, are strongly attracted by honey, bei ng able to scent it from a great distance. On this account it is al ways used, when possible, by trappers in connection with other baits. These may consist of a fowl, fruit, or flesh of any kind, and the honey should be smeared over it. Skunk cabbage is said to be an excellent bait for the bear; and in al l cases a free use of the Oil of Anise page 152 , sprinkling it about the traps, is also advisable. Should the device fail, it is well to make a trail (see page 153 ) in several directions from the trap, and extending for several rods. A piece of wood, wet with Oil of Anise, will answer for the purpose. The general method of skinning the bear c onsists in first cutt ing from the front of the lower jaw down the belly to the ve nt, after which the hide may be easily removed. The hoop-stretcher page 275 , will then come into good use in the drying and preparing of the skin for market. THE RACCOON. Although allied to the Bear family, this animal possesses much in common with the fox, as regards its general disposition and ch aracter. It has the same slyness and cunning, the same stealt hy tread, besides an additional mischievousness and greed. It is too comm on to need any desc ription here, being found plentifully throughout ne arly the whole United St ates. The bushy tail, with its dark rings, will be sufficient to identify the animal in any community. Raccoon hunts form the subject of many ve ry exciting and laughable stories, and a \"coon chase,\" to this day is a favorit e sport all over the country. The raccoon, or \"coon,\" as he is popularly styled, is generally hunted by moonlight. An experienced dog is usually se t on the trail and the fugitive soon seeks refuge in a tree, when its destruction is almost ce rtain. Hence the term \"treed coon,\" as applied to an individual when in a da ngerous predicament. Besides possessing many of the peculiarities of the fox, the \"coon\" has the additional accomplishment of being a most agile and expert climber, hol ding so firmly to the limb by its sharp claws as to defy all attempts to shake it off. The home of the raccoon is generall y in a hollow tree; the young are brought forth in May, and are from four to six in number. In captivity this animal makes a very cu nning and interesting pet, being easily tamed to follow its master, and when dain ties are in view becomes a most adroit p ick p ocket.

Nuts and fruits of all kinds it eagerly devours, as well as bread, cake and potatoe s. It manifests no he sitation at a meal of rabbit, rat, squirrel, or bird, and rather li kes it for a change, and when he can partake of a dessert of honey or molasses his enjoyment knows no bounds. Frogs, fresh water clams, green corn, and a host of other delicacies come within the range of his diet, and he may some times be seen digging from the sand the eggs of the soft-shelled turtle, which he greed ily sucks. We cordially recommend the coon as a pet. He becomes very docile, and is full of cunning ways, and if the yo ung ones can be traced to their hiding-place in some hollow tree, and secured, if not too young, we could warrant our readers a great deal of real sport and pleasure in rearing the little animals and watching their ways. In cold climates the raccoon lies dorm ant in the winter, only venturing out on occasional mild days; but in the Southern States he is active throughout the year, prowling about by day and by night in sear ch of his food, in serting his little sharp nose into every corner, and feeli ng with his slender paws between stones for spiders and bugs of all kinds. He spies the innocent frog with his head just out of the water, and pouncing upon him, he despatches him without a moment's warning. There seems to be no limits to his rapacity, for he is always eating and always hungry. The print of the raccoon's paw in the mud or snow is easily recognized, much resembling the impre ssion made by the foot of a babe. The best season for trapping the coon is late in the fall, winter, and early spring, or from and between the months of October and April. During this time the pelts are in excellent condition. Ea rly in the spring when the snow is disappearing, the coons come out of their hiding places to star t on their foraging tours; and at this time are particularly susceptible to a tempting bait, and they may be successfully trapped in the following manner:‚Äî Take a steel trap and set it on the edge of some pool, or stream where the coons are known to frequent: let it be an inch or so under the water, and carefully chained to a clog. The bait may consist of a fish, frog, or head of a fowl, scented with Oil of Anise, and suspended over the traps about two feet higher, by the aid of a sapl ing secured in the ground. (See title page at the head of this section.) The object of this is to induce the animal to jump for it, when he will land with his foot in the trap. Another method is to construct a V shaped pen set the trap near the entrance, and, fasteni ng the bait in the angle, cover the trap loosely with leaves, and scen t the bait as before with the anise. The trap should be at such a distance from the bait that the animal, in order to reach it, will be obliged to tread upon the pan, which he w ill be sure to do, his greed overcoming his discretion. Any arrangeme nt whereby the animal wi ll be obliged to tread upon the trap in order to reach th e bait will be successful. The beaten track of the coons may of ten be discovered in soft ground, and a trap carefully concealed therein will soon secure its victim. Another method is to set the trap near the coon tracks, spreading a few drops of anise on the pan and covering the whole with le aves. The coon, attracted by the scent, will feel around in the leaves for the bait, and thus \"put his foot in it.\" In the South they construct a coon tr ap from a hollow log, either having the ends supplied with lids, which fall just like the Rat trap page 100 as the animal passes through, or else constructed wi th nooses, similar to the Box-snare, page 56 .

THE BADGER. The American Badger is mostly confined to the Northwestern parts of the United States, and it is a curious little animal. In size its body is slightly smaller than the fox. Its general color is grey, a pproaching to black on the head and legs. There is a white streak extending from the tip of the animal's long nose over the top of the head and fading off near the shoulders. The cheeks are also white, and a broad and definitely marked black line extends from the snout back around the eyes ending at the neck. The grey of this animal is produced from the mixture of the varied tints of its fur, each hair presenting a succe ssion of shades. At the root it is of a deep grey; this fades into a tawny yellow, and is followed by a black, the hair being finally tipped with white. The fur is much used in the manufacture of fine paint brushes, a good \"Badger blender\" being a most useful accessory in the painter's art. The badger is slow and clumsy in its actions, except when engaged in digging, his capacities in this direction being so great as to enable him to sink himself into th e ground with marvellous ra pidity. The nest of the animal is made in the burrow, and th e young are three or four in number. His diet is as variable and extensive as that of the coon, and consists of anything in any way eatable. Snails, worm s, rats, mice and moles, se em to have a particular attraction for him; and he seems to take especial delight in unearthing the stores of the wil d bees, devourin g hone y , wax and g rubs to g ether, and carin g as little Pa g e 176 Pa g e 132 of 240 Cam p Life in the Woods and the Tricks of Tra pp in g and Tra p Makin g 11/01/2006 file://C:\\Documents and Settin g s\\Stuart Gorin g \\M y Documents\\Cam p Life in the Woo..."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"for the stings of the angry bees as he would of the bi lls of so many mosquitoes, the thick coating of fur forming a perfect protection against his winged antagonists. The badger is very suscepti ble to human influence, and can be effectually tamed with bu t little trouble. Although hi s general appearance would not indicate it, he is a sl y and cunning animal, and not ea sily captured in a trap of any kind. He has been know n to set at defiance all th e traps that were set for him, and to devour the baits without suffering for his audacity. He will sometimes overturn a trap and spring it fr om the under side, before attempting to remove the bait. Although not quite as craf ty as the fox, it is necessary to use much of the same caution in trapping th e badger, as a bare trap seldom wins more than a look of contem pt from the wary animal. The usual mode of catching the creature is to set the trap size No. 3 at the mouth of its burrow, carefully covering it with loose earth and securing it by a chain to a stake. Any of th e methods used in trapping the fox will also be found to work admirably. The dead-fall or garr ote will also do good service. Bait with a rat, mouse, or with what ever else the animal is es pecially fond, and scent with Oil of Anise or Musk. In early spring, wh ile the ground is stil l hard, badgers are easily captured by flooding th eir burrows. After being sati sfied that the animal is in its hole, proceed to pour in pailful af ter pailful of water at the entrance. He will not long be able to st and this sort of thing, and he may be secured as he makes his exit at the ope ning of the burrow. The skin should be removed whole, as in the case of the f ox, or as described for the beaver, and stretched as therein indicated. THE BEAVER. The Beaver of North America has now a world-wide reputation for its wonderful instinct and sagacity. The general appearance of this animal is that of a very large muskrat with a broad flattened tail, and the habits of both these animals are in many respects alike. The beaver is an amphibious creature and social in its habits of living, large num bers congregating together and forming little villages, and erecting their dome- like huts like li ttle Esquimaux. The muskrat has this same p ro p ensit y , but the habitation of the beaver is on a much Page 177 Pa g e 133 of 240 Cam p Life in the Woods and the Tricks of Tra pp in g and Tra p Makin g 11/01/2006 file://C:\\Documents and Settin g s\\Stuart Gorin g \\M y Documents\\Cam p Life in the Woo..."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"more extensive scale. These huts or \"B eaver lodges,\" are ge nerally made in rivers and brooks; although sometimes in lakes or large ponds. They are chiefly composed of branches, moss, gra ss and mud, and are large enough to accommodate a family of fi ve or six. The form of th e \"lodges\" is dome-like, and it varies considerably in size. The founda tion is made on the bottom of the river, and the hut is built up like a mound, often tw enty feet in diameter and projecting several feet above the surface of the water. The walls of this structure are often five or six feet thick, and the roofs are all finished of f with a thick layer of mud laid on with marvellous sm oothness. These huts form th e winter habitations of the beavers, and as this compost of m ud, grass and branches becomes congealed into a solid mass by the seve re frosts of our northern wint er, it can easily be seen that they afford a safe shelter against a ny intruder and particularly the wolverine, which is a most deadly enemy to the beaver. So hard does this frozen mass become as to defy even the edges of iron tools, and the breaking open of the \"Beaver houses\" is at no time an easy task . Beavers work almost entirely in the dark; and a pond which is calm and placid in the day time will be found in the night to be full of life and motion, and the squealing and splashing in the water will bear evidence of their industry. Lest the beavers should not have a sufficient depth of water at all seasons , they are in the habit of constructing veritable dams to ensure that result. Th ese dams display a wonderful amount of reason and skill, and, together with the huts, have won for the beaver a reputation for engineering skill which the creature truly deserves. In constructing these ingenious dams the beavers, by the aid of their powerful t eeth, gnaw down trees so metimes of large size, and after cutting them into smalle r pieces float them on the water to the spot selected for the emba nkment. In swift streams th is embankment is built so as to arch against the current, thus securing additional stre ngth, and evincing an instinct on the part of the animal wh ich amounts almost to reason. In cutting down the trees the beaver gnaws a circ ular cut around the trunk, cutting deepest on the side toward the water, thus causing the trunk to fall into the stream. The first ste p in constructin g the embankment is to la y the lo g s down cautiousl y in Pa g e 178 Pa g e 134 of 240 Cam p Life in the Woods and the Tricks of Tra pp in g and Tra p Makin g 11/01/2006 file://C:\\Documents and Settin g s\\Stuart Gorin g \\M y Documents\\Cam p Life in the Woo..."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"the required line of the da m, afterwards weighting them with heavy stones, which the beavers by their united effo rts roll upon them. The foundation of the embankment is often ten feet in width, and is built up by c ontinued heaping of branches, stones and mud, until it fo rms a barrier of immense strength and resisting power. In many cases, through a lapse of year s, and through a consequent accumulation of floating leav es, twigs, and seeds of plants, these embankments become thickl y covered with vegetation, and, in many cases in the Hudson Bay country, have even been know n to nurture trees of considerable dimensions. The broad flat tail of the animal serves a most excellent purpose, in carrying the mud to the dams or huts, and in matting and smoothing it into a solidity. The entrances to the various huts are al l beneath the water, and they all open into one common ditch, which is purposely dug in the bed of the river, and is too deep to be entirely frozen. In the su mmer time the huts are vacated, and the beavers make their abode in burrows on the banks of th e stream, which serve as a secure retreat at all time s, and particularly in wi nter when their houses are molested. The Indians of the Northwest are aware of this fact, and turn it to good account in the capture of the animals. When the beaver's village is in a small creek, or brook, it is first necessary to stake the water across both above and be low the huts. The next thing is to ascertain the exact spots of the burrows in the banks, and when we consider the river is covered with ice, this seems a ra ther difficult problem. But this is where the Indian shows his skill. He starts upon the ice, provided with an ice chisel secured to a long, stout handle. With this he strikes upon the ice, following the edge of the stream. The s ound of the blow determines to his practiced ear the direct spot opposite the opening of the burro ws, and at this point a hole a foot in diameter is made through th e ice. Following the edge of the bank he continues his search, and in like ma nner cuts the holes through th e ice until all the retreats are discovered. While the expert Indian s are thus engaged, the \"squaws\" are occupied in the more laborious work of breaking open the houses, and the beavers, alarmed at the i nvasion of their sanctums, ma ke for the banks, and the ready huntsmen stationed at the various holes, watch for their victims beneath the openings, until a violent motion or discoloration of the water betrays their passage beneath. The entrance to the holes in the bank are then instantly closed with stakes and the beaver is made pris oner in his burrow. Wh en the depth of the burrow will admit, the arm of the hunter is introduced, and the animal pulled out, but otherwise a long hook lashed to a pole is employed for this purpose. Scores of beavers are some times taken in this way in a few hours. Spearing is also often successfully reso rted to, and when the ice is thin and transparent the beavers may be clearly observed as they come to the surface, beneath the ice, for air. The general color of the an imal is reddish brown, th is tint being imparted principally by the long hairs of the fur. There is an inner a nd softer down of a grey color, which lies next the skin, and which is the valuable growth of the fur. The total length of the animal is about three feet and a half, the flat, paddle- shaped, scale-covered tail being about a foot in length. The young are brought forth in April or Ma y, from three to seven at a litter, and take to the water when a month old. The first four y ears in the beaver's life is spent under the \"maternal roof,\" afte r which period they shift for themselves.

The traps should be washed clean and soaked in ley, before using, a nd thereafter handled with gloves, as a mere touch of the finger will leave a scen t which the acute sense of the beaver will easily perceive. All footprints should be carefully obliterated by throwing water upon them, and some trappers say that the me re act of spitting on the ground in the neighborhood of the traps ha s been known to thwart success. Almost the only bait used in trapping the beaver is the preparation called \"barkstone\" by the trappers, or \"castoreum\" in commerce . This substance is fully described on page 150 under the head of \"Scent Baits.\" To the barkstone the trapper is mostly in debted for his success, and the effect of its odor on the beaver is something su rprising. Our best trappers inform us that these animals will scent this odor for a great distance, and will fairly \"squeal with delight,\" not being ea sy until the savory bait is discovered, which almost invariably results in capture. Taking advantage of this curious prope nsity, the trapper always carries a supply of castoreum in a closed vessel. There are various ways of trapping the beaver, of wh ich we shall present the best. An examination of the river bank will easily disc lose the feed ing place of the beavers, as evinced by the absence of the bark on the bran ches and trunks of trees. At this spot, in about four inches of water, se t your trap, which should be a Newhouse No. 4. Weight the end of the chain with a stone as large as your head, and, if possible, rest it on the edge of some rock pr ojecting into deep water, having a smaller rope or chain leading from the stone to the shore. A small twig, the size of your little fi nger, should then be strippe d of its bark, and after chewing or mashing one end, it should be dipped in th e castoreum. Insert this stick in the mud, between the jaws of the trap, letting it proj ect about six inches above the water. The beaver is soon attracted by the o dor of the bait, and in reaching for it, his foot is caught in the trap. In his fright he will immediately jump for deep water, thus dislodging the stone, which will sink him to the bottom, and thus drown him. The smaller chain or rope will serve as a guide to the trap, and the victim may be drawn to the surface. Another plan is to set the trap in about a foot of wate r, chaining it fast to a stout pole securely driven in the mud further out in the str eam, and near deep water. Bait as before. The trap being thus fastened will prev ent the efforts of the animal to drag it ashore, where he would be certain to am putate his leg and walk off. There is another method, which is said to work excellently. The chain is secured to a very heavy stone, and sunk in deep water, and the trap set a nd baited near shore, in about a foot of water. This accomplishes the same purpos e as the pole first described, and is even surer, as the animal will someti mes use his teeth in severing the wood, and thereby make his escape. In the case of the stone a duplicate rope or chain will be required to lift it in case of capture. The trap may be set at th e entrance to the holes in the banks, two or three inches under water, implanti ng the stick with the castor eum bait directly over the pan, a few inches above the wa ter. If the water should be de ep near this spot, it is an excellent plan to weight the end of the chain with a large stone with a \"leader\" from it also, as al ready described. Insert two or three sticks in the bank b eneath the water, and rest the stone u p on them.

No sooner is a break ascertained in the dam than all the beaver s unite in fixing it, and this peculiarity of habit may be turned to account in trapping them. Ma ke a slight break in the dam, five inches across, beneath the wa ter. On the under side of the break, and of course, on the inside of the dam, the trap should be set. The beavers will soon discover the leak and the capture of at least one is certain. The tr ap may be also set where the beavers are wont to craw l on shore, being pl aced several inches below the water in such a position that th ey will step on it when in the act of ascending the banks. Where the weighted stone is not used , the sliding pole page 145 should always be employed, as it is necessary to drown the animal, to prevent amputation and escape. The food of the beaver consis ts chiefly of the bark of various trees, together with aquatic plants. The fur is valuable only in the late fall , winter, and early spring. In skinning the beaver, a slit is made from the under jaw to the vent, after which it is easily removed. It should be tacked to a flat boa rd, fur side in, or stretched by means of a hoop, as described on page 275 . THE MUSKRAT. The muskrat, or musquash, is very much like a beaver on a small scale, and is so well-known throughout the United States that a detailed description or illustration will hardly be necessary. Reduce the size of the beav er to one foot in length, and add a long flattened tail, inst ead of the spatula-shaped appendage of this animal, and we will have a pretty good specimen of a muskrat. The body has that same thick-set appearance, and the gnawing teeth are very large and powerful. Like the beaver, the muskra t builds its dome-like huts in ponds or swamps, which it frequents; and although not as large as those of the beaver they are constructed in the same manner and of the same materials. Muskrats are mostly nocturnal in their habits; they are tireless swimmers, and in the winter travel great distances ben eath the ice; all of which peculiarities are like the beaver. Their food is quite va riable, consisting of grass and roots, oats, corn and other grain, apples and nuts , and even tomatoes, turn ips, carrots, mussels and clams, whenever these can be found. The muskrat is a native of all of th e Eastern, Western, and Middle States and also the Southern States, with the exce ption of Georgia, Alabama and Florida. They are also found in Cana da and the Arctic regions , and in the North-west. They are hunted and captured as a means of support to the na tive tribes of Indians who sell or trade the furs to Eastern dealers. The fur somewhat resembles that of the mink in texture, although not as fine, and the color varies from dark brown above to grey beneath. It is in its best condition during the winter, especially in March. The animal po ssesses a musky smell, from which it takes its name. It is said by many that the flesh of the anim al, when carefully prepared, becomes quite palatable food. Their houses are so nearly li ke those of the beaver that a second description is scarcely necessary. They are often five or six feet in height, and the entrances are all under water. Dozens of these huts may often be seen in ponds and marshes, and sometimes they exist in such numbers as to give the appearance of a veritable Es q uimaux villa g e. These houses are used onl y in the winter season.

They are very prolific, producing three litters a year. Like the beaver, otter and mink, th e muskrat can travel long distances under the ice with only one suppl y of fresh air, and its method is certainly very interesting. Before plungi ng beneath the ice th e animal fills its lungs with air, and when under the wate r it swims until it can no longer hold its breath. It then rises up bene ath the ice, empties its lungs, the air remaining in bubbles beneath the ice. In a short time this air abso rbs sufficient oxygen from the water and ice as to be life-sustaini ng, when the animal again inhales it and proceeds on its journey. It is by this means that the beaver, muskrat and mink are enabled to travel such great distances be neath unbroken ice, and it is certainly a very novel and interesting method. Where th e ice is thin and transparent these animals are sometimes captur ed through the means of this habit. A heavy stroke on the frozen hut will driv e its occupants to the wate r, and their course may easily be followed through the ice. If one of them is tracked, he will presently be seen to stop at the surface of the wate r for fresh oxygen, as already described. The bubbles will soon appear, and if the hunter immediately st rikes with an axe or heavy stick directly on the spot, the s ubmerged animal will be literally driven away from its breat h, and will of course drown in a very few minutes. A short search will soon reveal th e dead creature, after which he may be taken out through a hole cut in the ice. Otter and mink are sometimes taken in the same way. In many localities great numbers of muskrats are also captured by spearing, either through the ice or thr ough the walls of their houses . In the latter case, two are often taken at once. Th is method is quite uncertain and unreliable, as the walls of the hut are often so firmly froze n as to defy the th rust of the hardest steel, and a fruitles s attempt will drive the inmate s from their house at once. The spear generally used consists of a single shaft of steel about eighteen inches in length and half an inch in di ameter, barbed at the point, and is feruled to a solid handle five feet long. In spearing through the hut the south side is generally selected, as being more exposed to th e heat of the sun. Great caution is necessary, as the slightest noise will drive out the inmates. The spear should be thrust in a slanting direction, a few in ches above the surface of the ice. Where many houses exist it is well to destroy al l but one. Into this the whole tribe will centre, and by successive spearing they ma y all be captured. When the spear has been thrust into the house, it must be thus left until a hole is cut with a hatchet, through which to remove the game. Spearing through th e ice is a better method, but for general service th ere is no means of captur e more desirable than by trapping. The steel trap No. 1 or 2 is the size particularly adapted for the muskrat, and may be set in various ways. The most co mmon method is to set the trap under two inches of water on the pr ojecting logs or stones on the border of the streams where the \"signs\" of the animal indicate its recent presence. The trap should of course be secured by a chain, ringed to a sliding pole, page 145 , which will lead the animal into deep water when captured, and thus effect its speedy death by drowning. In this case bait is not necessary. If their feeding grounds can be discovered, or if their tracks indicate any particular spot where they crawl ashore at the water's edge, at this point a trap may be set with good success. In this instance it is well al so to set it under water, baiti ng with a piece of turnip, parsnip, apple, or the like, suspended a few inches above the pan of the trap. Late in the fall, when collecting their building material, they often form large beds of dried grasses and st icks, and a trap set in th ese beds and covered with some loose substance, such as grass, ch aff, or the like, will often secure the animal. The trap, in this case shoul d be attached to a spring-pole, page 145 as the muskrat is a wonderful adept at self-a mputation, when its escape depends upon it.

When this is done, the chain should be secured to a stick on the outside, and the hole repaired. No spring or sliding-pole is necessary in th is method, as the animal when caught will immediately run for th e water, and the weight of the trap will sink and drown its prisoner. Scent baits are sometimes us ed in trapping the muskrat, the musk taken from the female animal being pa rticularly valued. The Oils of Rhodium and Amber, page 151 are also successfully employed by many trappers; a few drops of either in the neighborhood of the trap, or di rectly upon it, being sufficient. Although steel traps are most generally used, there are several other devices which are equally if not even more desirable. Chief among these is the barrel trap, commonly and successfully employ ed in many parts of New England, where these animals often exist in such numbers as to render their destruction a matter of necessity. The above trap consists merely of an ol d barrel, sunk to it s upper edge in the river bank, and about half fi lled with water. On the surface of the water a few light pieces of wood are floated, over whic h the bait, consisting of carrot, sweet apple, or turnip, is placed. A trail is then made by dragging a piece of scented meat from the barrel in va rious directions, and a few pi eces of the bait are also strewn along these trails. The muskrats will thus be led to the barrel, and will be certain to jump in after the tempting mors els, and their escape is impossible. No less than a dozen muskrats ha ve been thus caught in a single barrer in one night, and a few of these traps have been known almost to exterminate the musquashes in localities where they had previously existed in such numbers as to become a pestilence to the neighborhood. A barrel trap constructed on the principle described on page 131 is also equally effective, although rather more compli cated in constructi on. The Twitch-up is often used, and possesses the advantage of a trap and spring-pole combined. Box traps, page 103 , are also to be recommended. The skin of the muskrat may be remove d in the same manner as hereinafter described for the otter, with the exception of the tail. This is considered the best method. It may also be ta ken off flat by ripping from the under jaw to the vent, and peeling around the eyes and mouth, le tting the skin of the legs come off whole, without cutting. Another common method consists in cuttin g off the feet, and then ripping with a knife from the front of the lower jaw dow n the neck and belly to a point a little beyond the forelegs. The lips, eyes, and ears are then careful ly skinned, and the hide is stripped ba ckwards from the body. In the latter method the bow-stretcher, page 274 , is used. THE OTTER.

It is an amphibious animal, and can remain for a long time ben eath the water. In size it is larger than a cat, and it possesses a tapering tail some eighteen inches in length. It s fur is of a rich brown color, and the hair is of two kinds, the one a close, fine, a nd exquisitely soft down, which lies next the sk in, and which serves to pr otect the animal from the extremes of heat and cold, and the other composed of long shining coarser hairs, which permit the animal to glide easily through th e water. In producing the beautiful otter furs of fashion these l ong hairs are plucked out, leaving only the softer down next the hide. Th e food of the otter mostly consists of fish, for the pursuit of which he has b een admirably endowed by na ture. His body is lithe and supple, and his feet are fu rnished with a broad web, which connects the toes, and is of infinite service in propelling th e animal through the water when in search of his finny prey. His long, broa d and flat tail serves as a most effectual rudder, and the joints of his powerf ul legs are so flexible as to permit of their being turned in almost any direction. The habitation of the otter is made in th e banks of the river which it frequents, or sometimes in a hollow log or crevi ce beneath rocks. The animal generally prefers to adopt and occupy a natural hollo w or deserted excav ation, rather than to dig a burrow for itself. The nest is co mposed of dry rushes, grasses and sticks, and the young, three or four in numb er, are produced in early spring. The track which the otter makes in the mud or snow is easily distinguished from that of any other anim al, on account of the \"seal\" or impression which is made by a certain ball on the sole of the foot. Otter hunting is a favorite sport in England, and indeed in the northern part s of our own countr y. Hounds are used to pursue the animal, and on account of the powerfully scente d secretion with which the creature is furnished by nature , its track is readily followed.

Ascending to the top of such an incline they throw themselves on the slippery surface and thus slide swiftly into the water. This pastime is often cont inued for hours, and is take n advantage of in trapping the playful creatures. A shor t search will reveal the pl ace where they crawl from the water on to the bank, and at this spot, wh ich will generall y be shallow, a steel trap should be set on th e bed of the river, about four inches under water. The trap should be secured by a stout chai n, the latter being ringed to a sliding pole, page 145 , which will lead the animal when ca ught into deep water. If deep water is not near at hand, the spring pole, page 144 , may be used, the object of either being to prevent the animal fro m gnawing off its leg and thus making its escape. The trap may also be placed at the top or the slide, two or thre e feet back of the slope, a place being hollowed out to receive it and the whole covered with snow. To make success more certain a log may be laid on each side of the trap, thus forming an avenue in which the animal will be sure to run before throwing itself on the slope. Care should be taken to handl e nothing with the bare hands, as the otter is very keen scented and shy. Anoint the trap with a few dr ops of fish oil or otter musk, see page 151 . If none of these are handy, ordinary musk will answer very well. The trap may also be set and weight ed with a heavy st one and chain, as described for trapping the b eaver. Another method still is to find some log in the stream having one end proj ecting above water. Spri nkle some musk on this projecting end and set the trap on the l og in three or four inches of water, securing it firmly by a chai n, also beneath the water. A rock which projects over th e stream may also be utili zed in the same way as seen in the page title at the opening of this section. Smear the musk on the edge which juts into the water, and secure th e trap by the chain as before. When the animal is caught he will fa ll or jump into the water, and the weight of the trap and chain will sink him. In every case it is necessary to oblit erate every sign of human presence by throwing water over ev ery foot print, and over everything with which the naked hands have come in contact. Where the traps are thus set in the water it should be done while wading or in a boat. In the winter when the ponds and rivers are frozen over the otte rs make holes through the ice at which they come up to devour their prey. Where th e water is a foot de ep beneath any of these holes the trap may be set in the bot tom, the chain being secured to a heavy stone. When the otter endeavors to emerge from the hole he w ill press his foot on the trap and will thus be caught. If the water is deep beneath the hole the trap may be baited with a small fish attached to the pan, and then carefully lowered with its chain and stone to the bottom. For this purpose the Newhouse, No. 3, is b est ada p ted, as the otter is in this case cau g ht b y the head.

A trap set at the mouth of the otter's bur row and carefully covered is also often successful , using the sliding pole, page 145 , to lead him into deep water. Every trapper has his pet theories and methods of trapping all the different animals, and the otter has its full share. We have given several of the best methods; and anyone of them will secure the desired resu lt of capture, and all of them have stood the test of time and experience. The skin of the otter should be rem oved whole, and the operation may be performed in the foll owing manner: Slit down the hi nd legs to the vent; cut the skin loose around the vent, and slit up the en tire length of the ta il, freeing it from the bone. With the aid of the knife the skin should now be peeled off, drawing it backward and carefully cu tting around the mouth and eyes before taking it from the head. With the fur thus inside, the skin is ready for the stretcher as described on page 273 , and the tail should be spread out and tacked around the edges. THE MINK. This animal, as will be seen by our illustration, has a long, slender body, something like the weasel, to which scient ific family it belo ngs. It inhabits the greater part of North America, and is also found abundantly in Northern Europe. The color of its fur varies considerably in different i ndividuals, the general tint being a rich, dark brown. The chin and th roat are light colore d, sometimes white, and this spot varies considerably in size in different i ndividuals, sometimes extending down on the throat to a consider able distance. The total length of the animal is from thirteen to sixtee n inches, its size being variable. The fur of the mink is excellent in quali ty, and has for many years been one of the \"fancy furs\" of fashi on, a good prime skin often br inging from ten to twelve dollars. The introduction of the fur seal , however, and the universal demand for this as well as otter fur, has somewhat thrown the mink into comparative shade, although extra fine skins will still command high prices. The mink is an aquatic animal, inhabiti ng small rivers and streams, and living somewhat after the manner of the otter. It has a most wi de range of diet, and will eat almost anything which is at all eata ble. Fishes, frogs, a nd muskrats are his especial delight, and he will occasionally succeed in pouncing upon a snipe or wild duck, which he will greedily devour. Cr aw fish, snails, and water insects of all kinds also come within the range of his diet, and he sometimes makes a stray visit to some neighboring poultry yard to satisfy th e craving of his abnormal hunger. A meal off from hi s own offspring often answers the same purpose; and a young chicken in the egg he considers th e ne plus ultra of delicacies. The voracity of this animal is it s leading characteristic, and is so largely in excess of its cunning or sagacity that it will often run headlong into a naked trap. Its sense of smell is exceedingly well developed, and through this faculty it is often enabled to track its p re y with ease and certaint y .

The chief occupation of the mink consists in perpet ual search for something to eat, and, when so engaged, he may be seen running along the bank of the stream, peering into every nook and corner, and literally \"leavi ng no stone unturned\" in its eager search. Taking a dvantage of this habit, it becomes an easy matter to trap the greedy animal. Set your trap, a Newhouse No. 2, in an inch of water near the edge of the str eam, and directly in front of a steep bank or rock, on which you can place your bait. The bait may be a frog, fish, or head of a bird, suspended about eighteen inches above the water, and should be so situated that in order to reach it, the mink will be obl iged to tread upon the trap. The trap may also be set in the water and the bait su spended eighteen inches above it, by the aid of a switch planted in the mud near th e trap. It is a good plan to scent the bait with an equal mixture of sweet oil and peppermint, wi th a little honey added. If there is deep water n ear, the sliding pole, page 145 , should be used, and if not, the \"spring pole\" in every case, in or der to prevent the captured mink from becoming a prey to larger animals, and also to guard against his escape by amputation, which he would otherw ise most certainly accomplish. The trap may be set on the land, near the water's edge, baiting as just described, and lightly covered with leaves or dirt. Any arrange ment of the trap whereby the animal is obliged to tread upon it in order to secure the bait, will be found effectual. The trap may be set at the foot of a tree, and the bait fa stened to the trunk, eighteen inches above it. A pen, such as is described on page 144 , may be constructed, and the trap a nd bait arranged as there di rected. Minks have their regular beaten paths, and often visit certain hollow l ogs in their runways. In these logs they leave unmista kable signs of thei r presence, and a trap set in such a place is sure of success.

Any mink which cro sses this trail will follow it to the first trap, when he will, in all probability, be captured. A dead muskrat, crow, fish, or a piece of fresh meat dragged along the line answers the same pur pose. The beaten tracks of the mink may often be di scovered, and a trap set in such a track and covered with leaves, dirt or the like , will often be successful. Minks may also be easily caught in the d ead-fall. Garrote trap or a twitch-up, baiting with fish, muskrat, flesh, or the he ad of a bird, of wh ich the animal is especially fond. A liberal use of the \"medicine\" is also desirable. The fur of the mink is in it s best condition in the late autumn, winter, and early spring, and the animal should be sk inned as described for the fox. THE PINE MARTEN. This animal belongs to th e tribe of \"weasels,\" and is closely allied to the celebrated sable, which it greatly resemb les. The pine marten is so called because it inhabits the northern climate s where pine forest s abound, and spends much of its life in the tree s in search of its prey. Its general appearance is truly represented in our illustration, its fur bei ng of a rich brown color, with a lighter or white patch on the throat. Its total le ngth, including the tail, is about twenty- eight or thirty inches, of which the tail represents ten inches. It is mostly confined to the forests in the far north, and is comparatively rare further south than the latitude of Maine and the lake s. The fur of the pine marten is of considerable value, particul arly if the animal be kille d in the winter. A really fine skin is but little inferi or to the celebrated sable, and is hardly distinguishable from it. The hair is long and glossy, and the under fur is beautifully soft and very thick. The dark colored skins are the most valuable. Although so nearly like the sable, the same comparison does not exist in regard to their proportionate market values, the marten fur bringing a much lower price.

It is a night prowler, and in the dark hours it traverses the trunks and branches of the trees in search of its prey. It moves with wond erful stealth and activity, and is enabled by its rapi d and silent approach to steal unnoticed on many an unfortunate bird or squirrel , seizing it in its deadly grip before the startled creature can think to escape. Coming acr oss a bird's nest, it makes sad havoc with the eggs or young, often adding the pa rent bird to his list of victims. Rabbits, partridges, and mice also fall into the marten's \"bill of fare,\" and the list is often further increased by a visit to a poultry yard, when the animal murders and eats all it can and ki lls the rest for sport. In pouncing upon its prey, the marten invariably seizes its victim by the throat, of ten dispatching the luckless creature with a single bite. The martens generally are said to be ve ry susceptible to hum an influence when taken young, and are very lively in a stat e of domestication. They are among the most graceful of animals, and in place of the disagreeable scent which renders many of their tribe offensiv e, this creature possesses an odor which is quite agreeable, and for this reason is often called the sweet marten in contradistinction to the foul marten or pole cat of Brit ain, which is like unto our skunk in the disgusting stench which it exhales. The dead-fall and Ga rrote traps are very successf ul in trapping the martin. They should be set several r ods apart, in the forest or on the banks of streams, and a trail established by dra gging a dead or roasted crow , entrails of a bird, or fresh meat from one trap to another, as described in relation to the mink, page 190 . The twitch-up may al so be used, and possesses the additional advantage of acting as a spring pole, thus holding the ca ptured victim out of reach of larger animals, to which it might otherwise become a prey. Any of the varieties described under the title of \"twitch-up\" will answer the purpose, and a little experimenting will soon prove which one will be the most successful for this particular animal. The bait may consist of a bird's or fowl's he ad, fish, liver, or any fresh meat or entrails. The common box trap, page 103 , or the box snare, page 56 , may also be used to good purpose, but the former will need to be carefully watched lest the enclosed prisoner gnaw his way out and thus escape. When the steel trap is employed, it shou ld be of the size of Newhouse, No. 2- 1/2, set on the ground beneath some rock, and covered wi th leaves, ro tten wood, or earth, and the bait fast ened or suspended about ei ghteen inches above it, in such a position that the anim al will be obliged to step upon the trap in order to reach it. An enclosure may be constructed of stones pile d together, the trap being set and covered in the opening and the ba it secured at the back. A staked pen, such as is described on page 143 , with the trap and bait arranged as there directed, also works well. Wh erever or however the trap is set, the ba it should be so placed that the animal cannot pos sibly climb on any ne ighboring object to reach it. The hollow of a tr ee trunk forms an excellent situation for the trap, and the same hollow may also be baited at the back and a dead-fall constructed across its opening. The box or barrel pit-fall, described on page 127 , is said to be very successful in trapping th e marten, always ba iting it with the platform secure for a few days before setting for captur e.

THE FISHER. This animal is classed among the marten s, and is principally to be found in Canada and the Northern Un ited States, where it is known as the black cat, or woodshock. In our natural histories it is described under the name of the pekan. In general habits, this species rese mbles the other martens, but its body inclines more to the weasel shape. The fur is quite valuable, and much resembles the sable. Its color is generally of a greyish brown, the grey tint being found chiefly on the back, neck, head and shoulders, the legs, ta il, and back of the neck being marked with dark brown. Like th e marten, the fisher prowls by night, frequenting swampy places in quest of food. It builds its habitation in hollow trees, and in burrows, which it excavates in the banks of rivers or streams, and it s young (generally twins) are produced in early spring. The trapping season for the fisher commences at about the middle of October, and extends to the middle of May, after wh ich time the fur decreases in value. In trapping the fisher, the same plans ma y be used as for the marten and mink, as these animals much rese mble each other in genera l habits. The steel trap arranged in an artificial or natural encl osure, or otherwise so set as that the animal will be obliged to step on it in order to reach the ba it, will be successful and the use of compositi on \"scent bait,\" described on page 153 will be found to enhance success. In every case where the steel trap is used the spring pole, page 144 , should always be employed, for the reasons already described. Dead-falls, garrotes, box-tra ps, twitch-ups, or pit-falls, may all be employed to good advantage. Bait with a fish or bir d, or fresh meat of any kind, and connect the various traps by a trail, as de scribed for the mink and marten.

This disgusting animal has won the unenviable but deserv ing reputation of being the most foul-smellin g creature on the face of th e globe. He belongs to the weasel tribe, and all these animals are noted for certain odors which they possess, but the skunk is pre-eminent in the utter noisomeness of the horrid effluvium which it exhales. This scent proceeds from a liquid secret ion which collects in a gland beneath the insertion of the tail, and the animal has the power to eject or retain it at will. It must have been given to the creature as a means of defence, for there seems to be no animal that can withstand the in fluence of its fetid stench. Dogs are trained to hunt the animal, but until they have learne d from experience the right method of attacking the fe tid game, and have discovered the whereabouts of the animal's magazine of amm unition, they are of little use to the hunter, and are onl y too g lad to p lun g e into some nei g hborin g brook, or roll in some near earth, Pa g e 195 Pa g e 146 of 240 Cam p Life in the Woods and the Tricks of Tra pp in g and Tra p Makin g 11/01/2006 file://C:\\Documents and Settin g s\\Stuart Gorin g \\M y Documents\\Cam p Life in the Woo..."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"in hopes of ridding themselves of the st ench which almost distracts them. The offensive propensities of the skunk are only exercised when the animal is alarmed or frightened. There are genera lly certain \"premonitory symptoms\" of attack which the creature usually exhibits , and it is well to retire from his \"shooting range\" as soon as they are observed. When the animal is ready to discharge his battery, he suddenly elevates his large bushy tail, over his body, and turns his back on his enemy. The result of the discharge fills the air for a great distance around, a nd man and beast fly from the neighborhood of the indescribable a nd fetid effluvium, which fairly makes one's nostrils ache . A single drop of this disgusting secreti on on the clothes is enough to scent the whole garment, and it is almost impossi ble to rid the tainted fabric from the odor. It is extremely acrid in quality, and if a very sma ll quantity fall upon the eyes, it is very apt to produce permanent blindness. Dogs, in their first experi ences with the skunk, are fr equently thus blinded, and there are well authenticated instances of human beings who have been deprived of their sight through their close pr oximity to an infuriated skunk. The writer, in his extreme youth, learne d, through dear experience, the putrid qualities of this noisome quadruped. It was on one bright Sunday, in New England, and he was out in his Sunday clothing, gatheri ng wild strawberries. He suddenly discovered a pretty little playfu l animal with bushy tail, romping in the grass near him. The creatur e was seemingly gentle, and showed no inclination to run away, and the pet-loving na ture of the writer prompted an irresistible desire to capture so pretty a creat ure. Encouraged by its gent le manner, he eagerly ran towards the tempting prize, and grasping it by the bushy tail, which the animal had raised p er p endicularl y , as if for a handle, the p rett y creature was locked in Pa g e 196 Pa g e 197 Pa g e 147 of 240 Cam p Life in the Woods and the Tricks of Tra pp in g and Tra p Makin g 11/01/2006 file://C:\\Documents and Settin g s\\Stuart Gorin g \\M y Documents\\Cam p Life in the Woo..."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"the affectionate embrace of its youthful admirer. But alas! he soon repented his rashness, and the treacherous \"pet\" was quickly flung away leaving its victim in such a foul state of overwhelming astoni shment as can be more easily imagined than described. Every article of clothing wo rn on that eventful Sunday had to be buried, and it took weeks of Sundays before the odor c ould be thoroughly erad icated from the hair and skin of the individual who wo re those Sunday garments. After this adventure, the youth became more cautious with respect to pret ty little playful animals, with black and white fur and bushy tails. There is hardly a farmer in the coun try but what has ha d some amusing or serious experience with the skunk, and almost every tra pper has, at one time or another, served as a target for his s hooting propensities. Na tural histories are replete with anecdotes of which this an imal is the mephitic hero, and volumes might be filled to the glory of his strong-smell ing qualities. Perhaps it is through the prejudice of the writer that he cannot enthusiastically recommend the skunk as a dom estic pet; but it is ne vertheless asserted, on good authority, that these animals, when reared from the young, become very interesting and playful in the househol d, and completely shut down on their objectionable faculties. Our illustration gives a very good idea of the animal, and it is so unlike any other creature that a furthe r description will not be necessary. The prevailing colors are white and black; but thes e vary much in proportion, the animal sometimes being almost totally white, or altogether black. The fur is long, and comparatively coarse, being intermixed with long, glossy hairs, and is most valuable in the black animal. The body of the creature is about a foot and a half in length, exclusive of th e tail, which adds about fourteen inches more. The skunk is generally nocturnal in its ha bits, secreting itself during the day in hollow trees, or crevices in rocks, or w ood-piles. At night it ventures forth in quest of its food, which consists chie fly of grasshoppers, worms and other insects, wild fruit and such small animals in the shape of frogs, mice and birds as it can capture. The poultry yard often offers an irre sistible temptation, and both fowls and eggs often serve to appease his appetite. The skunk is common throughout the greater part of North America, and in many localities the numbers increase ve ry rapidly unless checked. The young are brought forth in burrows or holes in rocks during April or May, and are from six to nine in number. \"Skunk fur\" does not sound well when t hought of in connecti on with a set of fashionable furs; and for this reason the pe lt of this animal is dignified by the name of Alaska sable by all dealers in the article. When known by this fancy title it suddenly becomes a very popular addition to fashion's winter wardrobe, and is one of the leading furs which ar e exported to meet the demand of foreign countries. Foul as the animal is, it seldom soils its own fur with its offensive fluid; and when carefully skinned the fur is as saleable as that of any other animal.

It should be covered with loose earth or chaff, or some other li ght substance, and baited with small bits of meat, dead mice, or eggs placed ar ound it. The enclosure illustrated on page 143 also answers well, and in all cases the spring pole, page 144 , should be used. The dead-fall, page 107 , is often employed, and the twitch- up, page 43 , is a particularly effective c ontrivance for their capture, often preventing the evil consequences of th e odor by causing instant dislocation of the neck, and this without injuring the fur. A stroke upon the backbone near the tail, by producing paralysis of the parts, al so prevents the animal from using his offensive powers, and a dead-fall so constr ucted as to fall upon the animal at this part will accomplish the same effect. To manage this it is only necessary to place the bait far back in the enclosure, so that the skunk on reaching it will bring the rear portion of his body beneath the suspe nded log. The scent of the skunk is as we have said, almost iner adicable, but we would reco mmend chloride of lime as the most effectual antidote. It is also said by some tr appers that the odor may be dissipated by packing the garment in fresh hemlock boughs, letting it thus remain for a couple of days. This is certainly a valuable hint if true, and is well worth remembering. For skinning the skunk, see Beaver, Otter and Fox. THE WOLVERINE. This, one of the most ferocious as well as detestable of Am erican animals, is principally found in British America and the upper portion of the United States. It has won a world wide reputation for its fierceness and vo racity, and on this account is popularly known as the Glutton. It is not confined to America, but is also found in Siberia and Northern Euro p e.

The muzzle, as far back as the eye-brows, is black, and the immens e paws partake of the same hue. The claws of the animal are l ong and almost white, forming a singular contrast to the jetty fur of the feet. So la rge are the feet of this animal, and so powerful the claws, that a mere look at th em will tell the story of their death deal ing qualities, a single stroke from one of them ofte n being sufficient for a mortal wound. Although the wolverine is not as large as th e bear, its foot prints in the snow are often mistaken for those of that creatur e, being nearly of the same size. The glutton feeds largely on the smaller quadrupeds, and is a most determined foe to the beaver during the summer m onths; the ice-hardened walls of their houses serving as a perfect protection agai nst his attacks in the winter time. To the trapper of the north the wolverin e is a most detest ed enemy, following the rounds of the traps and either detaching the baits or tearing away the dead animals which have fallen a pr ey to them. The trapper's en tire circuit w ill be thus followed in a single night, and where the veritable \"g lutton\" does not care to devour its victim it will sati sfy its ferocious instinct by scratching it in pieces, leaving the mutilated remains to tell the story of its nocturnal visit.

Dead-falls of larg e size will be found to work successfully, baiting with the body of some small animal, such as a rat or squirrel. A piece of cat, beaver or muskrat flesh is also excellent, and by slightly scenting with castoreum success will be made sure. Several of these traps may be set at intervals, and a tr ail made by draggi ng a piece of smoked beaver meat between them. The gun trap, as described on page 20 , will also do good service in exterminating this useless and troublesome animal. Steel traps of size No. 3 or 4 are co mmonly used to good purpose. They may be arranged in any of the various methods already described, the plan of the enclosure, page 143 , being particularly desirable. In all cases the trap should be covered with leaves , moss or the like, and the bait slightly scented with castoreum. Like all voraci ous animals, the perpetua l greed of the wolverine completely overbalances its caution, and thus renders its capt ure an easy task. The home of the animal is generally in a crevice or cave between rocks, and its young, two or three in number, are brought forth in May. In removing the skin, it may be ripped up the belly, or taken off whole, as described for the fox. THE OPOSSUM. The opossum is found more or less thr oughout nearly all the United States. In size it equals a large cat, the tail being about fifteen inches long, very flexible and covered with scales. The general color of the fur is grayish-white, slightly tinged with yellow, and the legs are of a browni sh hue, which color also surrounds the eyes to some extent. The fur is comparatively so ft and wooly, and thickly sp rinkled with long hairs, white at the base and brown at the tips. The nature and habits of th e animal are very interesting. Its nest is made in some sheltered hollow in an old fallen or live tree, or beneath overhanging roots or rocks, and composed of moss and dead leaves. The young are produced in several litters during the year, and when born are transferred by the mother to a pouch situated in the lower front portion of her body. Here th ey remain and are nourished by the parent until they are five weeks old, at which time they emerge and travel with their mother, and their li ttle ring tails do th em good service in holding fast to their guardian. It is an amusing sight to see a family of young 'possums thus linked together, and so \"attached to each other.\" The opossum is a voracious and destruct ive animal, prowling about during the hours of darkness and pryi ng into every nook and corner in hope of finding something that may satisfy the cravings of imperious hunger. Rats, mice, nuts, berries, birds, insects and eggs are al l devoured by this animal; and when not content with these he does not hesitate to insinuate hi mself into the poultry yard, and make a meal on the fowls and young chickens.

The rabbit or \"cotton tail,\" as he is familiarly te rmed, is too well-known to need any description here . From Maine to Texas our woods abound with these fleet-footed little creatures , of which there are severa l American species. They are the swiftest of all American quadr upeds, and have been known to clear over twenty feet in a single leap. They are all natural burrowers, although they often forego the trouble of excav ating a home when one ca n be found already made, and which can be easily modified or adapted to their purposes. The common rabbit of New England often makes its hom e or \"form,\" beneat h a pile of brush or logs, or in crevices in rocks. Here it brings forth its young, of which there are often three or four litters a year. The creature beco mes a parent at a very early age, and by the time that a rabbit is a year old it may have attained the dignity of a grand parent. The food of the rabbit consists of gr asses, bark, leaves, bulbs, young twigs, buds, berries and the like, and of cultivated vegetabl es of all kinds, when opportunity favors. When surprised in the woods it mani fests its alarm by violently striking the ground with its feet, causing the peculiar sound so often noticed at their first jump. The animal is fond of pursu ing a beaten path in the woods, and is often snared at such places . Its enemies, beside man, are the lynx, and other carnivorous animals, hawks, owls, and even the domestic cat. The rabbit is a favorite game with all am ateur sportsmen, and the devices used in its capture are multitudinous. It is by no means a difficult anim al to trap, and a glance through the second and fourth se ctions of our book, will reveal many ingenious snares and other contrivances, commonly and successfully used. The Box trap, page 103 , is perhaps the most univers al example of rabbit trap, but the Self-setting trap, page 110 , and Double-ender, page 109 , are also equally effective where the animal is desired to be taken alive. If this is not an object, the snare is to be recommended as simple in construction and sure in its result. The above constitute the only devices commonly used for the capture of the rabbit, the steel trap be ing dispensed with. On page 109 will be found additional remarks concerning the rabbit, and many hints no baiting, etc., are also given under the heads of the various traps above alluded to. The skin of the rabbit is very thin and tender, and should be carefully removed, either as described for the fox, or in the ordinary method, by incision up the belly. Full directions for curing and ta nning the skins will be found under its proper head in a later portion of this work. THE WOOD-CHUCK. This animal also called the marmot, is so well-known to most of our readers, that a detailed description will not be n ecessary, suffice it to say that the general color is brownish grey above, changing to reddish brown on the under parts. The head, tail and feet partaking of a darker color. The length of the animal is about a foot and a -half, exclusive of the tail, which is fou r inches lon g .

It is very unintelligent, and is always too ready to use its powerful teeth on the hand of any one who may attempt to handle it . It is naturally a timid animal, but when cornered or brought to bay, it fights most desperately. The woodchuck is an expert excavator, and where the animals exist in large numbers great damage is done by their united burrowing. They generally remain in their burrows during the day, only ventur ing out casually to see what is going on, and keeping near their entrance. Towa rds evening they start out to feed, devouring certain grasses and weeds, a nd also pumpkins and green corn with avidity, ever and anon sitting upright on th eir haunches, to see if the coast is clear. In case they are surprised in their meal, they hurry home in a pell-mell sort of a way, giving as much the appearance of rolling as running, but, nevertheless, getting over the ground with fa ir speed for such an unwie ldy animal. The skin is loose and very tough, and possesses no comme rcial value, being principally used for whiplashes. Their burrows are generall y on the slope of a hill, and often at the foot of a rock or tree. These tunnels vary from ten to th irty feet in length, sloping downward from the opening, afterward taking an upward turn and terminating in a roomy chamber, in wh ich the animal sleeps in winter and where the young from three to eight in number are brought forth. The woodchuck is found throughout nearly the whole of the United States, and is especially abundant in New England, where it is a decided nuisa nce. It is found as far south as Tennessee, and westward to the Rocky Mountains. The flesh of the woodchuck is by many much esteemed as food, particularly in the Fall. When used for this purpose, the animal should be ski nned and carefully cleaned immediately after death, taking especial care to remove the masses of fat which lie inside of the legs, as th ese, if allowed to remain, ar e sure to taint the flesh in cooking. The animals are easily caught by setting the traps at the entrance of their burrows, and carefully cove ring them with loose eart h, no bait being required. They may also be captured by the aid of a spring-pole, with noose attached, the pole being bent down and caught under a notched stick, and the noose being arranged at the opening of the burrow, see page 43 , the Woodchuck in passing in or out will become entangled in the noo se, and in his efforts to escape the pole will be loosened from the peg, thus li fting the animal in mid-air. Woodchucks are also sometimes drowned out of their hol es, and the turtle is often put to good use for the purpose of smoking the animals from their subterranean dwellings. A ball of wicking saturated with kerosene is attached by a wire to the tail of the reptile. When the ball is ignited the cr eature is introduced into the entrance of the hole, and of course in fleeing from its fiery pursuer it traverses the full length of the burrow, and as another matter of course drives out its other occupants, which are shot or captu red as they emerge. The woodchunk's skin is generally taken of f as described for the muskrat, and stretched accordingly. THE GOPHER. This remarkable little an imal somewhat resembles the Mole in its general appearance and habits. It is also comm only known as the Canada Pouched Rat, and is principally found we st of the Mississippi and nor thward. It is a burrowing animal, and like the Mole drives its subterranean t unnels in all directions, throwin g u p little hillocks at re g ular intervals of from five to twent y feet.

Its food consists of roots and vegetables, and its long and projecting inci sors are powerful agents in cutting the roots which cross its path in making its burrow. Th e most striking characteristic of the animal, and that from which it takes its name, consists in the large cheek pouches which hang from each side of the mouth and extend back to to shoulders. They are used as receptacles of food wh ich the animal hurriedly gathers when above ground, afte rward returning to its burr ow to enjoy its feast at its leisure. It was formerly very comm only and erroneously believed that the Gopher used its pouches in conveying the earth from its burrow, and this is generally supposed at the present day, but it is now known that the animal uses these pockets only for the conveyance of its food. The color of the fur is reddish-brown on the upper parts, fading to ashy-brown on the abdomen, and the feet are white. In making its tunnels, the di rt is brought to the surf ace, thus making the little mounds after the manner of the mole. After having dug its tunnel for several feet the distance becomes so gr eat as to render this process impossible, and the old hole is carefully stopped up and a new one made at the newly excavated end of the tunnel, the animal continuing on in its labors and dum ping from the fresh orifice. These mounds of earth occur at intervals on the surface of the ground, and although no hole can be discovered ben eath them, they nevertheless serve to indicate the track of the burrow, wh ich lies several inches beneath. The Gopher is a great pest to western cu ltivators, and by it s root feeding and undermining propensities does extensive inju ry to crops generally. They may be successfully trapped in the following manne r: Strike a line between the two most recent earth mounds, and mi dway between them remove a piece of the sod. By the aid of a trowel or a sharp stick th e burrow may now be reached. Insert your hand in the tunnel and enlarg e the interior sufficiently to allow the introduction of No. (0) steel trap. Set the trap flatly in the bottom of the burrow, and then laying a piece of shingle or a few sticks across the excavation replace the sod. Several traps may be thus set in the burrows at considerable distances apart, and a number of the animals th us taken. The traps are sometimes inserted in the burrows from the hillocks, by first fi nding the hole and then enlarging it by inserting the arm and di gging with the hand bene ath. The former method, however, is preferable. The skin of the Gopher may be pulled off the body either by cutting up the hind less, as described in reference to the Fox, or by making the incision from the lower jaw down the neck, as decide d for the muskrat, a simple board stretcher being used. THE MOLE. Of all the mammalia the Mole is entitled to take the first place in the list of burrowers. This extraordinar y creature does not merely dig tunnels in the ground and sit at the end of them, as is the case with many animals, but it forms a complicated subterranean dwelling plac e with chambers, passages and other arrangements of wonderful completeness. It has regular roads leading to its feeding grounds; establishes a system of communication as elaborate as that of a modern railway, or, to be mo re correct, as that of th e subterranean network of the sewers of a cit y . It is an animal of varie d accom p lishments.

Take the mole out of its proper sphere, and it is awkward and clumsy as the sloth wh en placed on level ground, or the seal when brought ashore. Replace it in the familiar earth a nd it becomes a differ ent being, full of life and energy, and actuate d by a fiery activity which seems quite inconsistent with its dull aspect and seemingly inert form. We all know that the mole burrows under the ground, raising at intervals the little hillocks or \"mole hills\" with which we are so familiar; but most of us little know the extent or variety of its tunnels, or that the animal works on a regular system and does not burrow here and th ere at random. How it manages to form its burrows in such admirably straight lin es, is not an easy problem, because it is always done in black darkness, and we know of nothing which can act as a guide to the animal. As for ourse lves and other eye-possessing creatures, the feat of walking in a straight line with closed eyelids is almost an impossibility, and every swimmer knows the diff iculty of keeping a stra ight course under water, even with the use of his eyes. The ordinary mole hills, so plentiful in our fields, present nothing particularly worthy of notice. They are merely the shafts through which the quadruped miner ejects the material which it has scooped out, as it drives it s many tunnels through the soil, and if they be carefully opened after the rain has consolidated the heap of loose material, nothing mo re will be discovered th an a simple hole leading into the tunnel. But let us strike into one of the large tunnels, as any mole catcher will teach us, and follow it up to the real abode of the animal. The hill under which this domicile is hidden, is of considerable size, but is not very conspicuous, being always pl aced under the shelter of a tr ee, shrub, or a suitable bank, and would scarcely be discovered but by a practiced eye. The subterranean abode within the hillock is so remarkable that it involuntarily reminds the observer of the well-known \"maze,\" which has puzzled the earliest years of youth throughout many generations. The centra l apartment, or \"keep,\" if we so term it, is a nearly spherical chamber, th e roof of which is almost on a level with the earth around the hill, and therefore situated at a c onsiderable depth from the apex of the heap. Around this keep are driv en two circular pass ages or galleries, one just level with the cei ling and the other at some height above. Five short descending passages connect the galleries with each ot her, but the only entrance into the keep is from the upper gallery, out of which thr ee passages lead into the ceiling of the keep. It will be seen therefore that wh en the mole enters the house from one of its tunnels, it has first to get into the lower gallery to ascend thence into the upper gallery, and so descend into the central chamber. There is, however, another entrance into the keep from below. A passage dips downward from the centre of the ch amber, and then, taking a cu rve upwards, opens into one of the larger burrows or high roads, as they may be fitly termed. It is a noteworthy fact that the high roads, of which there are several radiating in different directions, never open into th e gallery opposite one of the entrances into the upper gallery. The mole therefore is obliged to go to the right or left as soon as it enters the domi cile before it can find a passage to the upper gallery. By the continual pressure of the moles upon the walls of the passages and roof of the central chamber, they become quite smooth, hard, and polished, so that the earth will not fall in, even after the severest storm. The use of so complicated a series of cells and passages is extremely doubtful, and our total i g norance of the sub j ect affords anothe r reason wh y the habits of Pa g e 208 Pa g e 156 of 240 Cam p Life in the Woods and the Tricks of Tra pp in g and Tra p Makin g 11/01/2006 file://C:\\Documents and Settin g s\\Stuart Gorin g \\M y Documents\\Cam p Life in the Woo..."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"this wonderful animal should be better studied. About the middle of June the moles begin to fall in love, and are as furious in their attachments as in all other phases of their nature. At th at time two male moles cannot meet without mutual jealous y, and they straight way begin to fight, scratching, tearing, and biting with such insane fury that they seem unconscious of anything except the heat of battle. Indeed the whole lif e of the mole is one of fury, and he eats like a st arving tiger, tearing and re nding his prey with claws and teeth, and crunching audi bly the body of the worm be tween the sharp points. Magnify the mole to the size of the li on and you will have a beast more terrible than the world has yet seen. Though near ly blind, and therefore incapable of following its prey by sight, it would be active beyond conception, springing this way and that way as it goes along, le aping with lightness and quickness upon any animal which it meets, rending it in pieces in a moment, thrusting its blood- thirsty snout into the body of its victim, eating the still warm and bleeding flesh, and instantly searching for fresh prey. Such a creature would, without the least hesitation, devour a serpent twenty feet in length, and so terr ible would be its voracity that it would eat twenty or thirty of such snakes in a day as easily as it devours the same number of wo rms. With one grasp of its teeth and one stroke of its claws, it coul d tear an ox asunder; and if it s hould happen to enter a fold of sheep or enclosure of cattle, it would kill them all for the mere lust of slaughter. Let, then, two of such an imals meet in combat, and how terrific would be the battle! Fear is a feeling of which the mole seems to be utterly unconscious, and, when fighting with one of its own species, he gives hi s whole energies to the destruction of his opponent without seeming to heed the injuries inflicted upon himself. From the foregoing sketch the r eader will be able to estimate the extraordinary energies of this animal, as well as the wonde rful instincts with which it is endowed. The fur of the mole is not ed for its clean, ve lvety aspect; and that an animal should be able to pass unsoiled through earth of al l textures is a really remarkable phenomenon. It is partly to be explained by the character of the hair, and partly by that of the skin. The hair of the mole is peculiar on account of its want of \"set.\" The tops of the hairs do not point in any particular direction, but may be pressed equally forw ard or backward or to ei ther side. The microscope reveals the cause of this peculiarity. The hair is extremely fine at its exit from the skin, and gradually increases in thickne ss until it reaches its full width when it again diminishes. This alternation occu rs several times in each hair, and gives the peculiar velvet-like texture with wh ich we are all so familiar. There is scarcely any coloring matter in the slende r portion of the hair , and the beautiful changeable coppery hues of the fur is ow ing to this structur e. Another reason for the cleanliness of the fur is the strong, though membranous muscle beneath the skin. While the mole is engaged in tr avelling, particularly in loose earth, the soil for a time clings to th e fur; but at tolerably re gular intervals the creature gives the skin a sharp and pow erful shake, which throws off at once the whole of the mould that has collected upon the fur. So me amount of dust still remains, for, however clean the fur of a mole may seem to be, if the creature be placed for an hour in water, a consider able quantity of ear th will be dissolv ed away and fall to the bottom of the vessel. The improveme nt in the fur after being well washed with soft tepid water and soap, is almo st incredible. Many persons have been struck with such admiration for the fur of the mole, that they have been desirous of having a number of the skins collected and made into a waist-coat. This certainly can be done, but the garment thus made is so very hot that it can only be worn in winter. Such ga rments are very expensive, and owing to the tender q ualit y of the skin, p ossess but little lastin g p owers.

This odor adheres obstinately to the skin, and ev en in furs which have been dried for more than ten years, this peculiar sa vor has been noticed. We have given much space to the mole , not particularly on account of its particular usefulness to the trapper, but because of its many claims to our notice. If the creature were a rare and costly i nhabitant of some di stant land, how deep would be the interest which it would inc ite. But because it is a creature of our country, and to be found in every field, there are but few who care to examine a creature so common, or who experience any feelings save those of disgust when they see a mole maki ng its way over the ground in search of a soft spot in which to burrow. In many localities this interesting animal exists in such numbers as to become a positive nuisance, and the invention of a trap which would effectually curtail their depredations has been a problem to many a vexed and puzzled farmer. Mole traps of various kinds have found th eir way into our agricultural papers, but none has proved more effectua l than the one we describe on page 119 . An arrangement of the figure four , page 107 , is also sometimes employed with good success. In this case the bait stick cro sses the upright stick close to the ground, and rests over the burrow of the mole, th e earth being previously pressed down to the surrounding level. The stone shoul d be narrow and very heavy, and of course no bait is required. The pieces should be set caref ully, and so adjusted that the lifting of the soil beneath the stick as the mo le forces its way through th e compressed earth will dislodge the bait stick and let down th e stone with its crushing weight. Another method consists in embedding a de ep flower pot in one of the main tunnels of the animal, a nd carefully replacing the soil above. The mole in traversing his burrow thus falls into the pi t and is effectually captured. This is a very ingenious mode of ta king the animal, and rewarded its inventor with seven moles on the first night of trial. There are a number of other devices said to work excellently, but the above we believe to be the most effectual of all. There are several species of American moles, the star-nosed variety being familiar to most of us. The most co mmon moles are the shrew moles, with pointed noses. The silver mole is a large species, of a changeable silvery color, found on the Western prairies. The Oregon mo le is nearly black, with purplish or brownish reflections. The most beautiful of all the moles is f ound at the Cape of Good Hope. It is of about the size of the ordina ry American species, and it s soft fur glistens with brilliant green and golden reflections. Th e fur of this species is probably the most wonderful and beautiful in the whole animal kingdom. SQUIRRELS.

Squirrels, as a class, possess much the same peculiarities and habits. Their claws are particularly adapted for life among the trees; their tails are long and bushy, covering over the backs of the animals when in a sitting posture. They are all lithe and quick of movement, and their senses of sight and hearing are especially keen. They are constantly on the alert, and are full of artifice when pursued. Their food consists chiefly of nuts, fruits, a nd grain, but when pushed by hunge r, there is no telling what they will not eat. They generally provide for the winter months by laying up a store of the foregoing pr ovisions, either in holes in trees or interstices in the bark, or in cavities under ground. The shag -bark hickory offers an especial inducement to these provide nt creatures in the numer ous crevices and cracks throughout the bark. It is not an uncomm on thing to find w hole handfuls of nuts carefully packed away in one of these cr acks, and a sharp stroke with an ax in the trunk of one of these trees will of ten dislodge numbers of the nuts. The writer has many a time gone \"nutting\" in this way in the middle of winter with good success. The nests of squirr els are generally built in tr ees, either in a crotch between the branches or in some deserted woodpecker's hole. Some species live in burrows in the ground, and those indi viduals who are lucky enough to be in the neighborhood of a barn often make th eir abode therein, taking their regular three meals a day from the granary.

In the Southern States there is a variety known as the fox squirrel, about the size of the red squirrel, and quite variable in color. The Middle States furnishes a species called the cat squirrel, rather smal ler than the preceding. Its tail is very broad, and its color varies from ve ry light to very dark grey. The ground squirrel, or chipmuck, with its prettily striped si des, is common to most of our readers, its general color being red and the stripes being black and white. Another burrowing species, known as th e Oregon or downy squirrel, is found in the Territory from whic h it takes its name, and al so northward in British America. In size it resembles the chipmu ck, and its color is light red above, pure white beneath, and silver grey at the sides. The beautiful silky variety, known as the flying squirrel, with its grey chinchilla-like fur and loose skin, is found throughout the United States east of the Mississippi. Louisiana and Texas furnish the golden-be llied squirrel, which is about twenty inches in length, with tail golden yell ow beneath, and golden grey above. The sooty squirrel is also found in this localit y, being about the same size as the last mentioned, and black above a nd brownish red beneath. There are other varieties in California known as the woolly, soft-haired, and weasel squirrels; and in the Western States we find the large red-tailed squirrels, which are about the size of the large gr ey variety of the Eastern and Middle States. Squirrels, as a tribe, are much sought fo r as pets, and most of the species are easily tamed. Box traps of various kind s are used in taking them alive. The varieties on pages 103 , 106 and 110 are especially adapted for this purpose, and should be set either in the trees or on the ground, and baited with an apple, a portion of an ear of corn, or of whatever the animal is particularly fond. When the animals exist in such numbers as to become a de structive nuisance to the farm, the small-si zed steel trap, N o. 0, arranged with bait hung above it, will work to good advantag e. Twitch-ups are also su ccessful, and we might also recommend the traps on pages 107 , 116 and 128 as worthy of trial when the animal is not desired to be captured alive. Squirrels may be skinned either by ripping up the belly, or in a whole piece, as described in regard to the fox. We pause before going further into th e mysteries of tra pping in connection with the animals which we are about to consider, as they are generally exempt from the wiles of the trapper's art, co ming more properly in the field of the hunter or sportsman.

As far as ba rbarity goes, there is to us but little choice between the two methods; and, generally speak ing, we decry them both, and most especially do not wish to be understood as encouraging th e trapping of these animals, except where all other means have failed, and in cases where their capture becomes in a measure a matter of necessity. This is often the case in the experience of professional trappers. The life of the trapper during the trapping season is spent almost entirely in th e wilderness, often many miles from any human habitation; and at ti mes he is solely depende nt upon his gun or trap for his necessary food. Sometimes in a dry season, when the l eaves and twigs crack le under foot, the rifle is as good as useless, for it become s impossible to appro ach a deer within shooting range. And there are other time s when ammunition is exhausted, and the trapper is thus forced to rely only on his traps for his supply of food. In such circumstances, the necessities of the trapper are para mount, and the trapping of deer, in such straits, as th e most desirable food is rath er to be recommended than condemned. The same remarks also in a measure apply to the moose and prong- horn antelope, as well as to several other animals here inafter mentioned, as they are generally considered more in the light of the hunter's than the trapper's game. THE DEER. There are upwards of eight varieties of this animal which inhabit North America. The common red or Virginia n deer is found th roughout the United States. The stag or Wapiti deer is now chie fly confined to the country west of the Mississippi and northward to British America. The m oose we shall speak of hereafter. The Rocky Mountai n mule deer, and the long-t ailed deer of the same locality, are two more species, and ther e are also the black-t ailed deer and the reindeer, the latter of whic h is a native of British America. The scope of our volume will not of course admit of deta iled directions for trapping each variety, but, as the habits of all the species ar e in a measure similar, our remarks will apply to them in general, and particularly to the red or Virginian deer, which is the most important to American trappers. The trap for taking deer should be larg e, strong, and covered with spikes. The Newhouse (No. 4) is particularly adapte d, and is especially arranged for this purpose. When the path of the deer is discovered on the border of a stream or lake, the trap should be set beneath th e surface of the water, near the tracks of the animal, and covered by a handful of dried grass thrown upon it. When thus set, it may either be left to run its chances, or success, further insured by the following precaution: In winter the pr incipal food of the deer c onsists of the twigs, buds, and bark of various forest trees, a nd particularly thos e of the basswood and maple. In the season when the traps ar e set as above described, a most tempting bait is furnished by a large branch of eith er of those trees, freshly cut, and laid near the trap. The deer in feeding are thus almost sure to be captured. There are certain glands which are located on the i nner side of the hind legs of the deer, and which emit a very str ong and peculiar odor. The scen t of these glands seems to attract the animal, and for this reas on are cut out and used by trappers as a scent-bait. In the case alread y described, it is well to rub the glands on the twigs of the trees, thus serving as an additi onal attraction to the bait. There is still another metho d of tra pp in g deer, which is commonl y em p lo y ed in the winter Pa g e 215 Pa g e 161 of 240 Cam p Life in the Woods and the Tricks of Tra pp in g and Tra p Makin g 11/01/2006 file://C:\\Documents and Settin g s\\Stuart Gorin g \\M y Documents\\Cam p Life in the Woo..."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"time. The trap is sunk in th e snow at the foot of a tr ee, and the bait, consisting of an ear of corn or a few beards of other grain, is fastened to the tree, above the trap, three or more feet from the gr ound. The animal, in reaching for the bait, places its foot in the trap and is secured. When first caught, the deer be comes very wild and violen t; so much so that if the trap were chained or retarded by a heavy clog, the chain, or even the trap itself, would most likely be broken. The weight of a trap of this size is generally a sufficient impediment, no clog, or at best a very light one, being required. The first frantic plunge being ove r, the entrapped creature immediately yields and lies down upon the ground, and is always to be found within a few rods of where the trap was first sprung upon him. During th e winter the traps may also be set in the snow, using the same bait already de scribed. It is a comm on method to fell a small tree for the purpose, setting the traps beneat h the snow, around the top branches. The deer, in browsi ng in the tender tw igs or buds, are al most certain to be captured. Dead -falls of different kinds are sometimes used in trapping the deer, with good success; using the scent ba it already described, together with the other bait. The food of the deer during the summer c onsists of nuts, fruits, acorns, grass, berries, a nd water plants, and when in convenient neighborhood of cultivated lands, they do not hesitate to make a meal fr om the farmer's turnips, cabbages, and grain. As we have said, the winter food consists chiefly of the twigs of trees. When the snow is deep the deer form what are called \"yards,\" about such trees as they particularly select for th eir browsing. These yards are made simply by tramping down the snow, and large numbers of the deer are often thus found together. As the supply of food is consumed, the yard is enlarged, so as to enclose other trees for browsing, and where deep snow s abound throughout the winter, these enclosures often become quite extensive in area. Panthers, wolves, and wolverines take especial advantage of th ese, and easily secure their victims. By wolves especially entire herds of deer are thus destroye d, and whole yards depopulated in a single night. Panthers secr ete themselves in the trees above the boughs overhanging the \"yards,\" and, with stealthy movement s, approach and pounce upon their unsuspecting prey. The blood-thirsty wolverine secretes himself in the nooks and by-ways to spring upon its tawny victim unawares. These, together with man, form the pr incipal foes of th e deer, and we can truthfully assert that the hunter is much more its enemy than the trapper . As we do not wish to encourage the want on trapping of this noble creature, it would perhaps be well for us to devote also few words in describing the various modes of hunting the animal, adopted by the \"professional sportsmen\" throughout the land. The most common met hod is that called \"still hunting,\" most generally pursued in winter. The hunter is shod with deer-s kin or other soft sandals, and starts out with his rifle and ammunition. Finding the fresh track of the deer, he cautiously and noiselessly follows up the trail, keeping a sharp lookout ahead. A practised de er-hunter becomes very sk illful and accurate, and the animal is nearly always tracked to discovery, when he is shot. The deer's sense of smell is extremely acute, and, when in shooting range, it is very necessary to approach them in the face of the wind, the direction of which may be easily determined by holding the finger in the mouth for a moment, afterward pointing it upward toward th e sky. The cool side of th e finger will indicate the direction from which the wi nd blows, and toward that direction the deer should always be approached, or as far toward that direc tion as possible. It will sometimes ha pp en that the hunter will sur p rise the buck, doe , and fawn to g ether.

The buck and fawn will remain near the spot. The buck shoul d next be shot, and then the fawn, the charge being aimed at the breast. Never approach a wounded deer without reloading the gun, as he is often more frightened than hur t, and is likely to start and run away, unless prevented by another shot. Duri ng the snow season, deer are always watchful of their back track. They are generally at rest dur ing the day, starting out late in the afternoon on their usual ramblings, wh ich they continue through the night. During the dark hours they love to resort to the water side in quest of aquatic plants, and are he re often taken by hunters, many of whic h consider \"night hunting\" the favorite and most ex citing sport. It is pursued in the following manner: The hunter requires a boat or canoe, page 261 , a good rifle, and a lamp. The lamp, with a screen or reflector behind it, is placed at the bow of the boat. One hunter takes the oar, and, with noiseless paddle, propels or sculls the boat from the stem. The arme d hunter crouches behind the light, with the muzzle of his rifle proj ecting beyond the screen suff iciently to easily show the forward sight on the tip of the barrel. A dark lantern is sometimes used as a light. The eyes of the deer shine very perceptibly at night , and his presence on the banks is thus easily detected. If he is noiselessly approached, he will remain transfixed by the effect of the light from the boat, and he may be neared even to a very close range, when he is easily despatched. Hundr eds of deer are thus taken during the summer and autumn. D eer are also chased by dogs until they are forced to take refuge in the nearest rivers or la kes, when the hunter in his canoe overtakes and shoots them. Another method is frequently employed in the hunting of the deer. These animals are very fond of salt, and with it they are often decoyed to a spot wh ere the hunter lies in wait for them. These places are called \"deer licks,\" or sa lting places, and can be ma de as follows: Select a locality where deer are known to frequent, and place a ha ndful of salt either on a smooth spot of ground or in the hollow of a log. A sect ion of a log is sometimes slightly dug out at one end and the othe r inserted in the earth, the salt being placed in the hollow. The hunter secr etes himself in a neighboring tree, sometimes erecting a bench or scaffolding for comfor t, and, provided with gun and ammunition, he awaits the coming of the deer. H unters say that a deer seldom looks higher than his head, a nd that a sportsman on one of these scaffoldings, even though he is clumsy in his movements, is seldom noticed by the animal. The salt lick is al so utilized for night hunting. A head-lantern is generally required. This can be made in the following manner: Construct a cylinder of birch bark or paste-board or any like substance, ten inches in height, and of sufficient size to fit closely on the hea d. A circular partit ion should next be firmly inserted at about the middle of th e cylinder, and the centre of the partition should be provided with a socket for the reception of a candle. On this end of the cylinder a piece should now be cut to ad mit of the passage of light from the candle on that side. Having this fire-hat at hand wait patiently for the game. When a significant noise is heard light the candle an d place the cylinder on the head, with the open cut in front, thus directing the light toward the ground. As the deer approaches, his fiery eyes will easily be seen, and the light from the candle will shine sufficiently on the rifle to clearly re veal the sights and admit of a sure aim. There is still another met hod of night hunting by the salt lick. The rifle is aimed directly at the salted spot, and thus firm ly fixed‚Äîthis preparation being made in the daytime. When night approaches, the hunter finds a piece of phosphorescent wood or \"fox fire,\" and pl aces it on the ground, at a point which he has previously determin ed to be on a direct line of the aim of his gun. The \"fox fire\" is plainly seen from the tree, and as soon as it is darkened he knows that it is obscured b y the deer, and he p ulls the tri gg er and kills his g ame.

The sport legitimately begins in September, when the buck begins to harden his horns, and when his flesh is in its best condition for food. In October the deer is more shy, and during th is month and after, the sport is at its height. The deer should be skinned from an incision down the belly, and the hide spread on a hoop stretcher, page 275 . THE MOOSE. We have already given so much space to the hunting of the de er that we shall be obliged to cut short our remarks on the Moose, particularly as it is a representative of the same family. This an imal is the largest of the Deer tribe, being seven or eight feet in height and often weighing over fifteen hundred pounds. It is supplied with immense flat spreading horns, sometimes expanding to the distance of six feet between th e tips. It is found in Maine, Oregon and Washington Territories, and in the neighborhood of the gr eat lakes, and inhabits the regions as far north as the Arctic Sea. Its color is ye llowish brown. The fur is thicker in winter than summer, and on the neck of th e animal the hair is very coarse and hangs in an imme nse tuft of over a foot in length. The flesh is most excellent food and is much esteemed by trappers. The ha bits of the moose are in most respects identical with the deer, already described, and like them they form \"yards\" during the winter season. In the North the moose is hunted on snow -shoes by the natives, and in summer they are shot like the deer. They are of ten very dangerous and terrible creatures to hunt, and the utmost care and skill, as described in regard to the deer, is required on the part of th e hunter in order to avoi d detection through the ex q uisite sense of smell which the animal p ossesses.

They are much larger and more powerful than the domestic sheep, and the ram is provided with enormous curved horns. Th e wool of the anim al is intermixed with coarse grey hairs, and the general a ppearance of the fur is russet grey, with the exception of the rump and under parts, which are of a dirty white color. The animal is generally very wary and reti ring, and inhabits the most secluded and inaccessible mountain regions and rocky cliffs. They are easily captured by the steel trap (No. 5) set in thei r haunts. The dead- fall is also used in some instances. Rem ove the skin as described for the deer. THE BUFFALO. The Buffaloes or Bison of the Western plains is too well known to need description. They travel in migrating herds of thousands, and are found from Texas to British America. Their food c onsists chiefly of gr ass, of which the \"Buffalo grass\" is their great delight. They graze and travel through the day and rest by night. They are more the game of the hunter than the trapper, although the largest side Newhouse would effectua lly secure one of the animals. The Buffalo is generally hunted on horseback, the usua l method being that of stealing into the drove while grazing, al ways moving against the wind in order to avoid being scented. The flesh is pala table and by many much relished. The Buffalo skins of commerce are furnished by the cows. The bull skins are almost devoid of fur on the hinder parts, the hair being confined to the huge heavy mass on the hump and mane. Skin the animal as described for the Moose. THE PRONG HORN ANTELOPE. This sole American representative of th e Antelope tribe we believe is seldom trapped; but as it is a well-known animal on the Wester n plains, a short mention of it is required here. In general sh ape this creature bears considerable resemblance to the deer, th e form of the horn being its chief peculiarity, each one of which is provided with a singl e prong, from which the animal takes its name, of Prong Horn. The color of th e body is brownish-yellow, with the exception of the rump and belly whic h are almost white. The Antelopes generally travel in herds, and are much hunted by the Indians who surround them and destroy them with heavy clubs. Like the deer, their sense of smell is especially keen and the same caution is required in hunting them. In size they are about the same as the Virginian Deer . They are wonderfully graceful in all their movements, and are even more fleet of foot than the deer.

On this false covering, the bait, c onsisting of green corn or other vegetables, is strewn and a high wall of logs or stones is erected around it, in order that the animal will be obliged to jump slightly in order to reach the bait. Remove the hide as recommended for the deer. SHOOTING AND POISONING. Until the introduction of the steel-trap, shooting was a common method of taking fur bearing animals, and even to th e present day it is quite prevalent in some localities. Anyone who has had a ny experience with the fur trade must have learned that furs wh ich are \"shot,\" are much af fected in value. Some furriers will not purchase such skins at any price; and they never meet with any but a very low offer. \"Trapped furs\" and \"shot furs\" are terms of considerable significance in the fur trade, and anyone who wishes to realiz e from a profitable sale of his furs, should us e his gun as little as poss ible. A shot grazing through the fur of an animal cuts the hairs as if with a knife, and a single such furrow is often enough to spoil a skin. It is these oblique grazing shots which particularly damage the fur, and an animal killed with a shot gun is seldom worth skinning for the value of its pelt. If fi rearms are used, the rifle is preferable. If the animal chances to be hit broadside or by a direct penetrating bullet, the two small holes thus made may not particul arly effect the value of its skin, although even then the chances are rather slight. Trapped furs are of the greatest value. The use of poison is objecti onable as a means of capture in animals especially desired for their fur. Strychnine is th e substance generall y employed, and unless its victim is skinned immediately after death the pelt becomes considerably injured by the absorption of the poison. It has the effect of loosening the fur and the hair sheds easily. The poison is principally used in the capture of Wolves and animals considered in the light of vermin. For a wolf or fox, the poi son is mixed with lard or tallow and spread on pieces of meat, or a smal l amount of the powder is inclosed in an incision in the bait. Th e amount sufficient for a single dose may be easily held on the point of a knife bl ade, and death ensues in a a very few moments after the bait is taken. For a Bear the dose s hould be a half thimbleful, and it should be deposited in the centre of a piece of honey co mb, the cells being emptied of their honey for that purpose. Other animals may be take n by proportionate quantitie s of the poison, but for g eneral p ur p oses we discoura g e its use.

PLAN OF CAMPAIGN. The first thing to be consid ered in reference to a camp aign is the selection of a trapping ground, and it is al ways desirable to choose a locality where travel by water can be resorted to as much as possible. Otter, mink, beaver and muskrat are among the most desirable game for the trapper, and as these are all amphibious animals, a watere d district is therefore th e best on all accounts. Lakes, ponds, and streams, bordered by wild woods, form the best possible grounds for general trapping, and the m ountain lakes of th e Adirondacks and Alleghenies, and all simila r regions are especially desirable on this account. Almost any wild country, intersected with streams, lakes, and rivers, is apt to abound with game, and some trappers confine their la bors to the borders of a single lake, and adjoining forest. This pl an is especially to be recommended to the amateur, as much of the travelling to and fro can be done by boat, the labor being thus much lightened. Having de cided upon the seat of operations, the young trappers should immediately set to work at building their shanties and boats. The home shanty is of the greatest importance, and sh ould be constructed first. Select some flat bit of land near the water and clear it of brush wood, or other rubbish and proceed to work as described on page 242 . A good axe is the only tool required by an experienced trappe r in the construction of such a shanty. Should the trapping lines be ve ry extensive, additional bark shanties, page 245 , will require to be made at intervals along the line, for sleeping stations and shelters in case of storm. The profe ssional trapper generally attends to the building of his shanties and boats befo re the trapping season commences, and thus has everything in readiness for hi s campaign. If in a birch bark country the Indian canoe, page 260 , is the most desirable craf t, on account of its lightness and portability. The dug-out , or bateau, described on page 259 , will also do good service. The trapping season begins in October, and everything should be in readiness at this time, so that the trappers may devo te all their time stri ctly to business. The route of the professional trapper often extends over fi fty miles, and the number and weight of traps and pr ovisions which these rough-and-ready individuals often carry as personal luggage is most as tounding. Fifty or sixty pounds apiece is considered a fair burden, and they deem no one a fit physical subject for a campaign w ho cannot at least manage thirty pounds with comparative ease. The number of the tra pping party generally consists of from two to four. A few days prior to the ope ning of the trapping season, the party start out, laden with their burden of tr aps and provisions, and deposit them at intervals along the line, the provisions bei ng mainly kept in the \"home shanty.\" Several trips may be necessary to co mplete these preparations, unless the trapping ground is readil y accessible by wagon or boa t, in which case the transportation is much easier. The \"home shant y \" is g enerall y built onl y when the tra pp in g g rounds are far in Pa g e 226 Pa g e 168 of 240 Cam p Life in the Woods and the Tricks of Tra pp in g and Tra p Makin g 11/01/2006 file://C:\\Documents and Settin g s\\Stuart Gorin g \\M y Documents\\Cam p Life in the Woo..."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"the wilderness, miles away from civili zation. If the line extends from the outskirts of some town or village, such a hut may be dispense d with. It is used principally as a storehouse for furs, provisions, ammunition, tools, and other valuables, and also serves as a point of rendezvous, or a home, for the trappers, one of the number being ge nerally left in charge to \"keep shanty\" while his companions are on their tram ps in search of game. If desired, a boy may be taken along for this especi al purpose. In every case, so me such guardian is very necessary, and particularly in wild districts, abounding in wolves and bears, as these animals have an odd trick of breaking into ungua rded shanties, and often make sad havoc with its stores. Steel tr aps are almost exclusively used by the professional trapper, and the supply for a single campaign will often exceed one hundred and fifty. Many of the traps described in the earl y part of this work are also used, and for the amateur who has not the ready cash to layout in steel traps, are decidedly to be recommended and will be found very efficient. From thirty to fifty traps would be a fair number for an ordinary amateur trapping season, and the probable cost of such a lot w ould be from $15 to $25. The sizes of the traps will depend upon the game sought, No. 2-1/2 being a good average. With this supply, relying somewhat on dead-fall s, twitch-ups, and the various other devices described in our early pages, we can guarantee lively sport, of course, presuming that good judgment has been used in the selection of a trapping ground. In later articles, under the prope r headings, we give full details concerning food and cooking utensils, sh elter and bedding, as well as many other requisites for the trapper's comfort. To complete the list he should provide himself with a good sharp axe, and hatchet, and if the log canoe is in anticipation he will also require th e other tools mentioned on page 259 an oilstone being carried in order to keep the various tools in good repair; an auger, saw, and some large nails are also to be desired, and a small parcel containing needles, thread, pins, scissors, etc., will be found indispensable. \"Cleanliness is next to Godliness,\" and there are no mo re luxurious necessities in camp life than a piece of soap and a clean towel. For light it is advisable to carry a supply of candles, or a lantern with a can of oil. The la tter is, of course, more bulky, and for a campaign wholly on foot is hardly to be recommended on this account. Each trapper should be provided with a stout jack-knife, pocket-compass, and a supply of matches, a number of these being always carried on the person to provide for the emergenc ies to which the hunter is always subject. One of the party should carry a double-ba rrelled shot-gun and another a rifle, or both may be combined in a single weapon. A revolver is also a desirable acquisition. Purified neats-foot oil should be used on the fire-arms, and in lieu of this, some trappers use the melted fat of the grouse for the same purpose. A good supply of fishing tackle is almost indispensable, and with these valuable equipments the young trapper may defy the wilderness with all its hazards. With his traps, gun and rod, together with his store of provis ions, he may look forward to a larder well stocked and may calculate on an appetite which will do it justice. The list of portable provisions and c ooking utensils best adapted for a campaign are given under their proper titl e, and will be f ound to cover all the wants of the most fastidious. The stove is the most cumbersome article, but trappers generally dispense with its use al together, looking at it rather in the light of a luxury as well as a nuisance. The open camp fire will answer every purpose, both for cooking and for comfort in cold weather. For clothin g it is desirable to carr y at least two suits, in order to have a Pa g e 227 Pa g e 228 Pa g e 169 of 240 Cam p Life in the Woods and the Tricks of Tra pp in g and Tra p Makin g 11/01/2006 file://C:\\Documents and Settin g s\\Stuart Gorin g \\M y Documents\\Cam p Life in the Woo..."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"\"change.\" They should be of woolen, and from the hunter's point of view, should be of a sombre shade, so as to be as inconspicuous as possible. The use of high-top boots is to be de precated, as they are tiresome and unwieldy. Short boots, with thick, iron-pegged soles, are generally preferred by trappers, and in order to render them soft, pliable, a nd waterproof they may be soaked or smeared with a hot mixture, composed of one part ro sin, two part s beeswax, and three parts tallow. Simple ta llow, or even the fat of th e deer, is sometimes used for the same purpose. Calculating on a successful campai gn, a supply of board-stretchers, page 273 , will be needed for the curing of the sk ins, and if our adventurous enthusiasts should extend their expe rience along into the winter, the toboggan and snow- shoes will come into good use fo r convenient winter travel. The trapping season properly commences in October and ends in April. The pelts of fur bearing animals are in their best condi tion during this time, and in the winter are in their prime. The various modes of setting a nd baiting traps for all our leading animals are cl early set forth in another part of this volume. And in the accompanying engravings will be f ound life like representations of each species. In a trapping campaign it is an excellent plan to select a central point for the home shanty, extending the trapping lines in several directions therefrom, following the borders of the lakes or streams for the otter, beaver, mink and muskrat; and setting a few lines inland for the capture of martens, racoons, foxes, etc. For an amateur campaign this a most excellent and convenient arrangement, the lines may extend all the way from one to five miles each, and connect at their edges, the whole ground plan resemb ling the form of a wheel, the shanty corresponding to the hub, and the trapping line s the spokes, the tire representing the circuit connecting the various lines. Where the latter extend over many miles it is well to construct bark shanties at the limits. Let each tr apper take a certain \"spoke,\" and follow it to its terminus , returning on the adjacent line. On his arrival at the shanty he should immediately set to work skinning the animals taken, and stretching their furs. Full dire ctions for skinning the various game are given under their respective titl es, and the curing of skins is treated in detail in another chapter of this work. We also pr esent a table of the comparative values of the various American furs at the pres ent date of publicati on. Of course these values are constantly varying, but the table will serve at least to gauge the relative values of common and scarce furs . Great care should al ways be used in removing the skins from the various animals, as the final value of the fur much depends upon this. They should not be removed from the stretchers until perfectly dry, and should then be laid in a cool, airy place. When near a village or settlement it is advisable to send \"i nto town\" every few days with a batch of furs for safe keeping, and particularly so when the skins are valuable, and in cases where the home shanty is left unguarded. The valu e of prime otter or mink pelt is a matte r of no small importance, and a good trapping ground furnishes a rare field for light fingered prowlers w ho are well posted on the market price of raw furs, and who are constantly on the lookout for such prizes, either in the shape of the prepared skin, or on the back of the live animal. These \"trap robbers,\" or poachers, are the pests of trappers, and many have learned from dear experience the advisabi lity of placing their choi ce furs beyond the reach of the marauders.

If the campaign proves successful and pr omises well for a nother season, it is customary to hide the traps beneath ro cks, thus saving the labor of a second transportation. In order to keep the traps from rusting, it is well to cover them with oat or buckwheat chaff. The rock should be firs t rolled from its resting place, and a bed of the chaff made bene ath it, in which the traps should be covered, the rock being afterwards repla ced. In a few such places all the traps may be effectually stored away, and they will be f ound in prime order and ready for business on the following season. In the months of Septem ber and October trappers are much annoyed by gnats and mosquitoes, and, as a preventive agains t the attacks of thes e pests, we give on page 255 some valuable receipts, which ha ve stood the test of time, and are still the most effective remedies. The \"s mudge,\" consisting of a smouldering pile of birch bark is also used where the inse cts infest the tents or shanties by night. The bark should be dry, and should not be allowed to blaze. The smudge is generally placed at the en trance of the tent, and the trapper may then take his choice between smoke or mosquitoes, both cannot exist together, and a tent infested with the blood-thirs ty pests may be effectuall y cleared in a few minutes by the introduction of smoki ng brand for a few seconds . If the tent is now closely buttoned and the smudge kept burni ng directly outside, there will be no further trouble with the mosquitoes, and th e odor of the smoke is, after all, but a slight annoyance and to some is even en joyable after being on ce accustomed to it. When the home shanty is infested, it may be cleared in the same way, and by the aid of two or more sm udges on the windward side ma y be kept free from the insects. FOOD AND COOKING UTENSILS. The professional trapper on a campaign depends much upon his traps for his food, and often entirely contents himself with the subsistence thus gained. We encourage and believe in \"roughing it\" to a certain ex tent, but not to that limit to which it is often ca rried by many professional \"fol lowers of the trap\" throughout our country. The course of diet to whic h these individuals subject themselves, would often do better credit to a half ci vilized barbarian than to an enlightened white man, and when it comes to starting on a campaign with no provision for food excepting a few traps, a gun, and a box of matches, and relying on a chance chip for a frying-pan, he would rather be \"counted out.\" In ordinary cases we see no necessity for such deprivation, and, on the other hand, we d ecry the idea of transporting a whole kitchen and lard er into the woods. There is a happy medium between the two extremes, where by a light amount of luggage in the shape of cooking utensils and closely packed portabl e food, may render the wild life of the trapper very cozy and co mfortable, and his meals a source of enjoyment, instead of a fulf ilment of physical duty. What with the stock of traps, necessary tools, blankets, etc., the trapper's burden is bound to be pretty heavy, and it becomes necessary to select such food for transportati on as shall combine the greatest amount of nutriment and the least possible weight, and to confine the utensils to those absolutely necessary for decent cooking. The trapper's culinary outfit may then be reduced to the foll owing items, and in them he will find a sufficienc y for ver y p assable livin g .

By some it is mixed with twice its quant ity of wheat flour, and is thus used in the preparation of quite a variety of pa latable dishes. One or two pounds of salt pork will also be found a valuable addition; boxes of pepper and salt and soda should also be carried. With these si mple provisions alone, relying on his gun, traps and fishing tackle for animal food, the young trapper may rely on three enjoyable meals a day, if he is anything of a cook. Pork fritte rs are not to be despised, even at a hotel ta ble; and with the above they can be made to suit the palate of the most fastidious. Indian meal is a valuable accessory with cooks generally, and to the trapper it often becomes his grea t \"staff of life.\" If our young en thusiast desires to try his hand at roughing it to the fullest extent, compatible with common sense and the strength of an ordinary physical cons titution, he may endeavor to content himself with the above portable rations; but with anything le ss it becomes too much like starvation to arouse our ent husiasm. For cooking utensils, a small frying-pan and a deep tin ba sin are indispensable; and a drinking cup is also to be desired. The kind known as the telescope cup, constructed in three parts, which close within each other, when not in use, possesses great advantages on account of its portability. With thes e one can get along pretty decently. The pork fritters already mentioned form a favorit e dish with trappers generally, and can be made in the following way; have at hand a thick batter of the Indian meal and flour; cut a few sl ices of the pork, and fry them in the frying-pan until the fat is tr ied out; cut a few more slices of the pork; dip them in the batter and drop them in the bubbli ng fat, seasoning with salt and pepper; cook until light brown a nd eat while hot. The questi on now arises, \"What shall we eat them with?\" If you are \"roughing it ,\" such luxuries as plates and knifes and forks are surely out of the questi on; and you must content yourself with a pair of chop sticks \"a la Chinee,\" or make your jackknife do double purpose, using a flat chip or stone as a plate. A small tin plate ma y be added to the list of utensils if desired, but we are now confining ourselves to the \"lowest limit\" of absolute necessities. That wholesome di sh known as \"boiled mush,\" may come under the above bill of fare ; and fried mush is an old stand-by to the rough and ready trapper. In the first case the Indian meal is slowly boi led for one hour, and then seasoned as eaten. It is then allowed to cool, and is cut in slices and fried in fat. Indian meal cakes ar e easily made by dropping a qua ntity of the hot mush in the fr y in g - p an, havin g p reviousl y stirred in a small q uantit y of soda, and turnin g Pa g e 232 Pa g e 172 of 240 Cam p Life in the Woods and the Tricks of Tra pp in g and Tra p Makin g 11/01/2006 file://C:\\Documents and Settin g s\\Stuart Gorin g \\M y Documents\\Cam p Life in the Woo..."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"it as soon as the lower side is brow ned. A Johnny cake thus made is always appetizing, and with the addi tion of a little sugar, it becomes a positive luxury. Hoe cakes, so much relish ed by many, can be made by mixing up a quantity into a thick mass, adding a little soda. Bake in the fire on a chip or flat stone. The trapper's ground is generally in the nei ghborhood of lakes or streams, and fresh fish are always to be ha d. They may be cooked in a manner which would tempt a city epicure; and when it comes to th e cooking of a fresh brook trout, neither a Prof. Blot nor a Delmonico can compete wi th the trapper's recipe. The trout is first emptied and cleaned thr ough a hole at the neck, if th e fish is large enough to admit of it; if not, it shou ld be done by a slit up the belly. The interior should be carefully washed and seasoned with salt and pepper; and in th e case of a large fish, it should be stuffed with Indian meal. Build a good fire and allow the wood to burn down to embers; lay the fish in the hot ashes and cover it with the burning coals and embers; leave it thus for about half an hour, more or less, in proportion to the size of the fish (this may be easily determined by experiment); when done, remove it carefully from the ashes, and peel off the skin. The clean pink flesh and delicious savor which now manifest themselves will create an appetite where none before ex isted. All the delicate fl avor and sweet juices of the fish are thus retained, and the trout as food is then known in its perfection. By the ordinary method of cooking, the trout loses much of its original flavor by the evaporation of its juic es; and although a delicious morsel in any event, it is never fully appreciated excepting after being roasted in the ashes, as above described. The other method consists in rolling the fish in the Indian meal and frying it in the frying-pan with a piece of th e salt pork. Seasoning as desired. Partridges, ducks, quail, a nd other wild fowl are mo st delicious when cooked in the ashes as described for the trout. The bird should be drawn in the ordinary manner, and the inside washed perfectly clean. It should then be embedded in the hot coals and ashes, the feathers having been previous ly saturated with water. When done, the skin and feathers will easily peel off, and the flesh will be found to be wonderfully sw eet, tender, and ju icy. A stuffing of pounded crackers and minced meat of any kind, with plenty of seas oning, greatly improves the result, or the Indian meal may be used if desired. A fowl thus roasted is a rare delicacy. A partridge, squirrel, pigeon, woodcock, or any other game can be broiled as well in the woods as at home, using a couple of green-branched twigs for a spider or \"toaster,\" and turni ng occasionally. For this purpose the bird should be plucked of its feathers, cleanly drawn and washed, and spread out by cutting down the back. Venison, moose, or bear meat, can be deliciously roasted in joints of several pounds before a good fire, using a green birch branch as a spit, and resting it on two logs, situated on opposite sides of the fire. The meat can thus be occasionally turned and pro pped in place by a sm all stick, sprinkling occasionally with salt and pepper. The above manner of making the fire is that adopted by most woodsmen. Two large green logs, of several feet in length, being first laid down at about three feet distant, betwee n these the fire is built, and when a kettle is used a heavy pole is so arranged as to project and hold it over the fire. A cutlet of venison fried in the pan is delicious, and a \"Johnny cake\" cooked in the fat of this meat is a decided dainty. With the above hints fo r a \"rough and ready\" camp aign, we think the young tra pp er ou g ht to be able to g et alon g q uite comfortabl y .

If accessible by wagon or boat, or both, they may be carried in unlimited qua ntities, but when they are to be borne on the back of the trapper through a path less wilderness of miles, th e supply will, of course, have to be cut short. When two or th ree start out together it becomes much easier, one carrying the trap s and tools; another the gun s, cooking utensils, etc.; the third confining his lugga ge to the food. One of the most necessary requisites for a journey on foot consists in a knapsack or large square ba sket, which can be easily strapped to the back of the shoulders, thus leav ing the hands free. Matches are absolutely indispensable, and a good supply should be car ried. They should always be enclosed in a la rge-mouthed bottle with a cl ose fitting cork, to prevent their being damaged by moisture. For furthe r safety in this regard the matches may be rendered perfectly water-proof by dipping their ends in thin mastic or shellac varnish. If not at hand, this varnish can be easily made by dissolving a small quantity of either sort of gum in three or four time s its bulk of alcohol. It is well to dip the whole stick in the so lution, thereby rendering the entire match impervious to moisture. Lucifer matches are the best, and, wh en thus prepared, they may lay in water for hours without a ny injury. It is a fe arful thing to find oneself in the wilderness, cold and hu ngry, and without the means of lighting a fire, and to prepare for such an emergenc y it is always advisa ble to be provided with a pocket sun glass. So long as the sun shines a fire is thus always to be had, either by igniting a small quantity of powder (which the trapper is always supposed to carry) or using powdered \"touc h wood\" or \"punk tinder\" in its place. Fine scrapings from dry w ood will easily ignite by th e sun glass, and by fanning the fire and adding additional fuel it will soon burst into flame. In cloudy weather, and in the absence of matc hes, a fire may easily be kindled by sprinkling a small quantity of powder on a large flat stone, setting a percussion cap in its midst, and cove ring the whole with dry leav es. A smart strike on the cap with a hammer will ha ve the desired result, and by heaping additional fuel on the blazing leaves the fire soon reaches large proportions. If the young trapper should ever be so unfortunate as to find himself in the wild woods, chilled and hungry, minus matche s, powder, caps, and sun gl ass, he may as a last resort try the following: Scrape some lint or cotton from some portion of the garment, or some tinder from a dry stick, and lay it on the surface of some rough rock, white quartz rock if it can be fou nd. Next procure a fragment of the same stone, or a piece of st eel from some one of the tr aps, and strike its edge sharply, and with a skipping stroke into the further side of the tinder, the direction being such as wi ll send the sparks thus pr oduced into the inflammable material. Continue this ope ration until the tinder ignite s. By now gently fanning the smoking mass it may easily be coaxed into flame. At least so our Adirondack guide told us last summer. The author ha s never had occasion to test the merits of the plan for himself, and has no special desire of be ing so placed, as that his life will hang upon its success. He presen ts it therefore as a mere suggestion without endorsing its practicab ility, and would rather pr efer matches in the long run. The open fire generally serves bo th for purposes of warmth and cooking, but by many, a camp stove is considered a great improvement. Stoves of this character, and for this especial purpose, are in the market. They are small and portable, with pipe and furniture, all of which pack away closely into the interior. A fire is easily started in one of these stoves, and, by closing the damper, a slow fire may be kept up through the night. Th e stove is generally set up at the entrance of the tent, the pipe passing through the top, in a hole near the ridge pole. The furniture cons ists of three pots or kettles, which pack easily into each other, and when in the stove sti ll leave ample room for a considerable amount of p rovisions.

The lid may be used as a plate, and for this purpose the handle consists of an iron ring, whic h will fold flat against the surface when inverted. Knives , forks, and spoons are easily stowed away in the stove or knaps ack, and a coffee-pot should always be carried. There is a knife known as the combination camp -knife, which is much used by hunters and trappers, and contai ns a spoon, fork, knife, a nd various other useful appendages, in a most compact form. It costs from one to two dollars. For provisions, potatoes will be found excellent, both on account of their portability and the variety of ways in which they may be served. They are healthy and nutritions, and always palatabl e. Beans are also very desirable for the same reasons. Wheat flour will form a valuable addition to the trapper's larder, and particularly so, if the \"sel f-raising\" kind can be had. This flour contains all the required ingredients for light bread and biscuit, and is sold by grocers generally, in packag es of various sizes, w ith accompanying recipes. We strongly recommend it where a stove is employed; and to anyone who is fond of biscuit, bread, or pancakes, it will be a ppreciated. Butter, lard, sugar, salt, pepper and mustard are valuable accessories, an d curry-powder, olive oil, and vinegar will often be found useful. Olive oil is often used by camping parties with the curry powder, and also as a substitute for lard in the frying-pan. Pork, Indian meal and crackers, wheaten grits, rice, and oat-meal are desirable, and coffee and tea are great luxuries. For soups, Liebig 's extract of beef is a most valuable article, and with the additi on of other ingredients, vege tables or meat, the result is a most delicious and nutritious dish. Th is extract is obtainable at almost any grocer's, and full directi ons and recipe s accompany each jar. Canned vegetables are much to be desired on account of thei r portability, and are never so delicious as when cooked over a camp fire. Lemonade is always a luscious beverage, but never so much so as to a thirsty trapper. A few lemons are easily carried and will repay the trouble. All provisions, such as meal , flour, sugar, salt, cracke rs, and the like, should be enclosed in water-proof canvas bags, a nd labelled. The bags may be rendered water-proof either by painting, (in which case no lead or arsenic paints should be used) or by dipping in the preparation described on page 247 . If these are not used, a rubber blanket, page 250 , may be substituted, the eatables being carefully wrapped therein, when not in use. The butter and lard should be put up in air- tight jars, and should be kept in a cool place, either on the ground in a shady spot, or in some cool spring. For a campaign on foot, the knapsack, or shoulder-basket, already alluded to on page 234 , is an indispensable article. It should be quite large and roomy, say fifteen inches in depth and ten by twelve inches in its other dimensions. The material should be canvas, rubber cloth, or wicker, and, in any case, the opening at the top should have a water-proof covering extendi ng well over the sides. The straps may consist of old suspender bands , fastened crosswise on the broad side of the bag. The capacity of such a knaps ack is surprising, and the actual weight of luggage seems half reduced when t hus carried on the shoulders. When three or four trappers start together, which is the usual custom, and each is provided with such a shoulder basket, the luggage can be thus divided, and the load for each individual much lightened. Venison is the trapper's favorite food, and in mild weather it sometimes ha pp ens that the over p lus of meat becomes tainted before it can be eaten.

The flesh is first cut in to small, thin strips, all the meat being picked o ff from the bones. The piece s are then placed on the inside of the hide of the animal and thoroughly mixed with salt, a pint and a half being generally sufficient. The salt bei ng well worked in, the fragments should be carefully wrapped in the hide, and suffered to remain in this condition for two or three hours. The meat is then ready to be dried,‚Äî\"jerked.\" Four forked poles should be first driven into the ground, about six feet apart, in the form of a square, the forks being f our feet above ground. Lay two poles of green wood across the forks on the two oppos ite sides of the square, and cover the space between them by other poles laid across them, an inch or two inches apart. On to this mammoth gridiron the strips of fles h should now be spread, and a steady fire of birch or other clean, fresh wood shoul d be kept steadily burning beneath for about twenty-four hours. At the end of this time th e meat will have reduced much in size and weight. The salt will have been thoroughly dried in , and the flesh so prepared maybe kept for almost any length of time. In its present condition it is excellent eat ing, and it is always at hand for frying, and may be cooked in a variety of ways. Moose and bear meat may be dried in a similar manner, using a proportionate amount of salt . Fish may also be prepared in the same way, for which purpose they shoul d be scaled as usual and afterward spread open by cutting down the back, th e bone being remo ved. We cordially recommend this method of preparing both flesh and fish, and no trapper's \"recipe book\" is complete without it. In localities where wolves abound, the noc turnal invasions of these creatures often render the keeping of fresh meat a very diffi cult task, and in this connection it may be well to give directions for the pr eservation of game desired to be used either as fresh m eat or for purposes of drying. The spring-pole is most common ly and successfully used. Select some stout sapling, bend it down, and cut off a limb several feet from the ground. Hang the meat in the crotch thus formed, an d allow the tree to swing back. By dividing the meat in to several parts it may thus all be protected. When a moose or deer is killed at such a time or place, or under such circumstances as render its immediate dressing impossible, its carcass may be defended against mutilation by another means. Wolves are naturally sly and sagacious, and have a wholesome fear of a trap. Any unnatu ral arrangement of logs and stones immediately excites their su spicion, and the trapper take s advantage of this wary peculiarity to good purpose. Laying his dead game near some fallen tree or old log he strews a few branch es over the carcass, or pe rhaps rests a log over it. Sometimes he hangs the entr ails of the animal over the body, on a forked stick, anyone of which devices is said to have the desired result. The wolverine is another pest to the trapper, and not bei ng so sly as the wolf, never hesitates to pounce upon any flesh within its reach. The former method, ther efore, is always the safest plan for absolute protection against all animals. The moose and deer are th e favorite food of trappers in the country where these animals abound, and the trappers of the Far West find in the flesh of the Moufflon, or Rocky Mountain sheep, a deli cacy which they consider superior to the finest venison. The prong -horn antelope of the Wes tern plains is another favorite foo d -animal with hunters, and the various \"small g ame,\" such as Pa g e 238 Pa g e 176 of 240 Cam p Life in the Woods and the Tricks of Tra pp in g and Tra p Makin g 11/01/2006 file://C:\\Documents and Settin g s\\Stuart Gorin g \\M y Documents\\Cam p Life in the Woo..."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"squirrels, rabbits, woodchucks, etc., ar e by no means to be despised. The author once knew a trapper who was loud in his praises of \"skunk meat\" for food, and many hunters can test ify to its agreeable fla vor when properly dressed and cooked. It is hard, to be sure, to getup much enthusiasm over a skunk, dead or alive, but where other food is not to be had we would discour age the young trapper from being too fastidious. The buffalo, or bison, is th e great resource of the tr appers of the West. The tongue, tenderloin and brisket are generally preferred, but all the meat is eatable. The flesh of the cow is best. It much resembles beef, but has a more gamey flavor. In winged game there is no food s uperior to the flesh of the grouse, and the great number of the speci es and wide range of terri tory which they inhabit render them the universal food game of trappers throughout the world. The ruffed grouse or partridge, pinnated grous e or prairie hen, spruce or Canada grouse, and the cock-of-the-plains or sage cock, are familiar American examples of the family, and their near relatives, the ptarmigans, af ford a valuable source of food to the trappers and hunters, as well as general inhabitants of our northern cold countries. Here they are known as \"snow grouse,\" and there are several species. The willow ptarmigan is th e most common, and in Rome localities exists in almost incredible numbers. Flocks numbering several thousand have been frequently seen by travellers in the Hudson's Bay territory; and the surface of the snow in a desirable feeding gr ound, is often completely covered by the birds, in quest of the willow tops, whic h form their chief f ood during the winter season. The Indians and nati ves secure the birds in large numbers, by the trap described on page 75 , and Hearne, the traveller a nd explorer of the Hudson's Bay region, asserts that he has known over three hundred to be thus caught in a single morning, by three persons. Of water fowl, ducks and geese are esp ecially to be recommended. The former are hunted with decoys and boats, and are sometimes trappe d, as described on pages 94 . The species are distinguished as sea ducks and river or inland ducks. The latter are considered the most desi rable for food, being more delicate and less gamey in flavor than the salt-water, or fish-eating variet ies. The mallard, teal, muscovy, widgeon, and wood-chuck ar e familiar species of the inland birds, and the merganser and canvass-back are the two most esteemed salt-water varieties. Wild geese are common throu ghout North America, and may be seen either in the early spring or late fall mi grating in immense numbers. They form a staple article of food in many parts of British Americ a, and great numbers are salted down for winter supply. They are trapped in large numbers, as described on page 75 , and are hunted with tame geese as decoys, the hunter being secreted behind a screen or covert, and attracti ng the game by imitating their cries. Fish form an agreeable change to the trapper's diet, and may be caught by the hook and line, or by spearing. The latter method requires considerable practice and skill, but is very suc cessful. The Indians of the No rth are great experts in the use of the spear, and the number of salm on taken by them annually is enormous. The spear generally consists of five or six steel prongs an inch apart and barbed at the ends. It is mounted on a heavy ha ndle, and when it stri kes its victim its grip is sure death. The spearing is gene rally performed either at the spawning beds or at the falls. Salmon trout are generally speared in the night time by boat, the spawning ground, generally a gravel bank near the s hore, being the seat of operations.

As his companion in the stern of the boat paddles, he keenly watches for his victim, and, se eing his opportunity, ma kes his lunge and lands his prize. To become a successful spearman requires much practice and no small degree of skill. To retain one's balance, acquire quickness of stroke, and withal to regulate the aim so as to allo w for the refraction of the light in the water, all tend to invest th e sport with a degree of skill which only experience can master. Fishing through the ice in winter is a rare sport, and large numbers of brook and lake trout are often taken at this season by cutting holes through the ice and fishing with hook and line. The baits commonly used consist of cow's udder or hog's liver, these being esp ecially preferred on account of their toughness. Angle worms are also excellent, an d any kind of raw meat may be used if other bait is not to be had. It is asserted by some sportsmen that bait scented with assaf≈ìtida is much more attractive to the fis h, and will insure a capture which would ot herwise be impossible. Sweet cicily a nd anise are also used for the same purpose. When the trout bite lively, fishing thr ough the ice is a most exciti ng sport, and by the aid of \"tip-ups\" a single person ma y command a great number of lines. The winter resort of the brook trout is in water two or three feet deep, over sandy beds. The lake trout frequent deeper water. The holes are made in the i ce at intervals of one or tw o rods, and a line set in each hole. The \"tip-up\" consists of a narrow strip of lath or shingle, with a hole bored through it near the large end. At this end the line is attached, and the hook thrown in the water. A branch is now in serted through the aper ture, and its ends are rested across the opening in the ice. No sooner does the fish bite than the long end tips straight in th e air, and thus betrays its captive. Ten or fifteen of these contrivances will of ten keep one pretty bus y, and do good service. By some an ordinary cut fish pole, arranged on a crotch, is used instead of the tip- ups just described. Pickerel fishing thr ough the ice is a favorite winter sport in many localities. The line should be about thirty feet in length, and the bait should consist of a small, live fish, hooked through the back. A small cork float should be attached to the li ne at such a distance as wi ll keep the bait above the bottom, and the superfluous li ne should be laid in a l oose coil near the hole, the end being attached to a sm all switch or bush, stuck up in the ice near by. The pickerel, on taking the bait, should be allowed to play out the whole line before being pulled in, as the fish requires this time to fully swallow his prey, after which the hook is sure to hold him firml y. Twenty or thirty lines may thus be attended at once, the bush or twig acti ng the part of a tip-up, or sentinel. Pickerel spearing is another successful mode of capture during the winter months. A large hole is made in the ice, in about two feet of water, and covered by a spacious box or board hut, six or seven feet s quare, and provided with a door. The spearman, concealed within, lowers his bait, consisting of an artificial fish with silver fins, made especially for the purpose. This he continually twirls in the water, and as the pick erel approaches the bait, he gradually raises it, until the fish is deco y ed nearl y to the surface of the water, when a q uick stroke of the Pa g e 240 Pa g e 241 Pa g e 178 of 240 Cam p Life in the Woods and the Tricks of Tra pp in g and Tra p Makin g 11/01/2006 file://C:\\Documents and Settin g s\\Stuart Gorin g \\M y Documents\\Cam p Life in the Woo..."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"spear secures his victim, and the line is again lowered. This is capital sport, and is very successful. There is a very curious device for fishing by night commonly employed by some anglers, and sometimes known as the \"lantern, or fish tr ap.\" Many kinds of fish are attracted by a light , but to use a light as a bait, submerged beneath the water, certainly seems odd. It may be done, however, in the following way: The \"fish lantern\" used for this purpose consis ts of a bottle containing a solution of phosphorus in sweet oil. Procure a piece of the stick phosphorus the size of a small cherry, and submerging in a saucer of water, proceed to cut it into small pieces. Have in readiness a three-ounce wh ite glass bottle half filled with sweet oil. Drop the pieces of phosphorus into the oil and co rk the bottle tightly. In the space of a few hours the phosphorus will ha ve been completely dissolved, and the contents of the bottle will present a thick, luminous fluid, which in a dark room, will afford considerable light. This is the fish lant ern. To use it, the cork is firmly inserted and the bottle, with fish line attached, is lowered through the hole in the ice. The water becomes luminous for several feet around, and the unusual brightness attracts the fish in large num bers. They are plainly, discernible, and are readily dispatched with the spear, or captured by a circular net, sunk on the bottom, beneath the luminous bait. This is certainly an odd wa y of catching fish, but it is often a very efficacious method. It has not been our intention to enter very extensively into the subject of fishing, but only to give such hints as will be found esp ecially useful and practical to the trapper in relation to hi s food. The above method s, together with those of trolling and fly-fishing, are thos e most commonly employed by trappers and hunters generally, and we commend them to the amateur. We give, on page 120 , a unique device for the captu re of fish, which might also be found useful. With the above general remarks on the campaign, together wi th what follows in the detailed articles on the subject, we think that the ground will have been completely covered. Every possible requi rement has been anticipated, and every ordinary emergency foreseen and provided against. THE TRAPPER'S SHELTER. The life of the professional trapper is a life of hard ship and severe exposure, and a man not only requires considerable courage, but also great bodily vigor, in order to combat successfully the dangers of such a wild, adventuresome existence. The cold and the storm not only imperil his life , but he is often exposed to the attacks of wild beasts. A shelter, theref ore, in one form or another, becomes a necessity while it is alwa ys a decided comfort, in comparison to a campaign without it. The reader will find below descriptions of the various shelters alluded to in other parts of this work, and used by trappers throughout the land. The most substantial of these is the log shanty, commonly known among tra pp ers as the \"home shant y ,\" on account of its bein g constructed as the onl y Pa g e 242 Pa g e 179 of 240 Cam p Life in the Woods and the Tricks of Tra pp in g and Tra p Makin g 11/01/2006 file://C:\\Documents and Settin g s\\Stuart Gorin g \\M y Documents\\Cam p Life in the Woo..."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"permanent shelter on the trapping line.

Although, to the amateur trapper, the log shanty is not likely to become a necessity, we will ne vertheless describe its mode of construction, in order to satisfy our more earnest and adventurous readers, who aspire to a full taste of wild life. Our illustration gives a very cl ear idea of such a shanty. THE HOME SHANTY. It may be constructed of any size, but one of about twelve by ten feet will be found large enough for ordinary purposes. Select straight logs, about eight inches in diameter. The whole number requi red will be thirty -six. Of these one- half should be twelve feet in length and the other ten. These s hould now be built up in the square form, on a level piece of ground, laying the en ds of the logs over each other, and securing th em by notches at the corners, so deep as to allow the edges of the logs to meet. Lay two short logs first, a nd continue building until all the thirty-six logs are used, and we will now have four symmetrical sides about six feet in height. The place for the door should now be selected. The u pp ermost lo g should form its u pp er outline, and the two sides should be cleanl y Pa g e 243 Pa g e 244 Pa g e 180 of 240 Cam p Life in the Woods and the Tricks of Tra pp in g and Tra p Makin g 11/01/2006 file://C:\\Documents and Settin g s\\Stuart Gorin g \\M y Documents\\Cam p Life in the Woo..."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"and straightly cut with a crosscut saw. The window openings, one or more, may next be cut, commenci ng beneath the second log fr om the top, and taking in three beneath it. Replace the logs above, and on the ends of those thus cut, both in windows and doors, proceed to spike a heavy plank, driving two nails into each log, about five inches apart, one above the other. This will hold them firmly in place, and offer a close-fitting jam for the door, and neat receptacle for the window sashes, which latter may now be put in after the ordinary manner. The gable ends should next be built upon the smaller sides of the hut. Commence by laying a long log (notched as before) acro ss the top of the frame work, and about two feet inside the edge . This should of cour se be done on both sides of the hut, after which they should be overlapped at the corners with logs eight feet in length. Next lay two more long logs, parallel with the first two, and about a foot inside them, notching as before. The ends of these should be spanned with beams eight feet in lengt h. Two more long logs are next in order‚Äî let them be one foot inside the last two. Overlap these with beams five feet and a half in length, and in the ex act centre of these last pieces chop notches for a heavy log for a ridge pole. The gable outli ne, direct from the ridge pole to the eaves, should now be cut off by the aid of a sharp axe. This may be done either while the pieces are in position, or the lin e may be marked with a piece of chalk, and the logs taken down in order to accomplish it. The r oof is now required. This should consist either of strips of bark or the r ounded sides of logs split off and hollowed into troughs. The latter me thod is preferable, on account of its greater strength and durabili ty, but the bark will answer the purpose very well, and is much more easily obtained. The ma nner of adjusting the roof pieces is clearly shown in our illu stration. The first row is la id on with the hollow side up, securing them at top an d bottom by nails driven th rough each into the ridge pole and eaves-log, care being taken that one of these pieces projects well over the gable, on both ends of the hut. These pieces are now overlapped by the second row, and with the addition of the la rge piece which covers them all at the ridge pole, the roof is complete, and will stand a heavy ram with little or no leaking. The crevices should now be st opped with moss, dried grass or clay, after which the log cabin is complete. Wh en the bark roof is made, additional poles may be inserted beneath as props. Th ey should be three or four inches in diameter, and run parallel with the ridge pole, at intervals on the slope, notches being cut to secure them. Our engraving represents a chimney, whic h may be constructe d if desired, but the necessity of this may be done away with by using a small camp stove, and making a small opening in the gable end of the hut for the passage of the pipe. If it stove should not be at hand, and our amateur should de cide to \"rough it\" to the full extent, he may build his fire-place and chimney as follows: It will be necessary to cut away an opening in the logs at the gable end, as was done for the door and windows. This should be about three feet square, and the fire place should be built of stone and clay, or cement, to fill the opening, and project inside the hut. The chimney may then be built up outsid e in the same manner, sufficiently high to overtop the gables. Inside the hut overhead will be found abundant room for the hanging of the skins, and any number of cross-poles may be rested across the beams. There are facilities for the swinging of a hammoc k, if desired, and, in fact, a hut constructed like the fore g oin g is a p erfect one in its wa y .

This is made by first driving into th e ground two forked poles seven or eight feet in height and stout e nough to sustain a ridge pole of moderate size. Against this ridge pole other poles should be rested at interv als of two feet, and sloping to the angle of forty-five degrees. The frame-work thus formed should now be covered with bark, commencing at the gr ound and allowing the edge of each piece to overlap the one ben eath after the manner of sh ingles, in order to shed the rain in case of storm. Spruce or birc h bark are excellent for this purpose, and the pieces may be secured with nails, a nd kept flat by the weight of another series of poles rested ag ainst them. The sides of th e shelter should be treated similarly, the front being us ually left open to face the fire, which the trapper generally builds a few feet di stant. In constructing a bark shanty, it is well to select some spot protected from the wind, close to the foot of a mountain or in the midst of trees, always letting the open si de face the direction most sheltered. If desired, the front can be enclosed af ter the manner of the sides and top, but this is not required wher e the fire is used. This style of shelter is repr esented in our page title to this section, and certainly looks very comfortable. TENTS. Shanties like the foregoing are in genera l use among the old veteran trappers of all countries, and even to the amateur th ere is a charm in a shelter constructed from the rude materials of the woods wh ich the portable tents do not possess. Tents, however, are much used both by professionals and amateurs, and are indeed valuable acquisitions to the tra pper's outfit, and wher e time is valuable, do away with the labor which the constr uction of a hut or shanty involves. Tents are of several kinds. Those most commonly used by the trapper are the house-tent, fly-tent, and half-tent, or shelter-tent. The first of these is made for prop-pol es and a ridge pole, closed on one end and buttoning up at the other. The sides ar e perpendicular for two or three feet, before the slope commences, and the st ay-ropes are fastened to the eaves. The fly-tent is generally a large, squa re piece of canvas, with ropes extending from opposite sides. This is thrown over a ridge pole, or over a rope extending between two trees, and the si des are held to the prope r slope by tightening and pegging the side ropes to the ground. Fly-te nts are also made with ends, which can be lowered, and the whole tent may be pegged close to the ground. The shelter-tent, when erected, resembles, in general shape, the bark shanty already described. It consists of a strip of canvas, having each end cut off to a point. The tent is pitched over three slanting poles, and the ends are brought down and securel y p e gg ed. This is clearl y shown in our illustration.

The shelter- tent, however, is so useful an affair, a nd withal so very simple made, that we will give a few directions in regard to its manufactur e. It should be made from stout cotton drilling , or very heavy sheet ing. Let the piece be about thirteen feet in length by six in widt h. Each end of the piece should now be cut to a rectangular point, commencing to cut at a distance of three feet from each corner. In order to render the cloth waterp roof, it should now be dipped in a pail containing a solution of e qual parts of alum and s ugar of lead, a couple of handfuls of each, in tepid water. It shoul d be allowed to rema in several minutes in soak, being dipped and turned occasi onally, after which it should be spread out to dry. This treatment not only renders the cloth impervious to rain, but the alum tends to make it fire-proof also. A spark from the fire falling upon a tent thus prepared, will often rest upon the cloth until it goes out, without doing the slightest damage. The manner of pitching the tent has already been all uded to, and is clear from our illustration. The poles s hould be three or four in number, and seven feet in length, inserted in the ground at the angl e denoted. The two outside poles should be seven feet apart, and the intermedia te ones equally dispos ed. The tent piece should now be laid over the poles, and the ends brought down and pegged to the ground at the apex, and rear corners of each side through loops, which should have been previously attached to these pa rts. A tent, thus arranged, affords a safe shelter from the wind or a moderate storm, and with a bright fire in front, is warm and comfortable. BEDS AND BEDDING.

A bed of this kind we illustrate, and it can be made in the fo llowing manner: Procure a large piece of canvas, sacking or other str ong, coarse material six and a half feet square. If a single piece of this size can not be found, several parts may he sewed together to the required dimensions. After which two opposite sides sh ould be firmly stitched together, thus forming a bottom less bag, if we may be allowed to use the expression. Two stout poles seven or eight f eet in length and as large as the wrist should now be cut. Insert them through the bag, allowing the ends to project equally on each side. These ends should now be rested on two logs, one placed across each end of the canvas. In or der to hold the poles in place notches should be cut in the logs at such distance s as will draw the ba g to its full width. The interior of the canvas should now be fi lled with dried gra ss, leaves, moss or spruce boughs, after which the beds tead and bed is complete. The yielding elasticity of the poles and the softness of the warm filling in the bag, give the effect of a spring and straw mattress co mbined, lifting the sleeper above the cold, damp ground, and by the a ddition of a blanket above, insuring warmth on all sides. If the logs are not at hand four forked stakes may be used, driving them firmly into the ground at such distances as will draw the bag to its full width, when the poles ar e rested upon them. If by the weight of the body the forked props should tend to incline toward s each other this trouble may be easily remedied by inserting short poles as br aces between them. If desired a bed of this kind may be used as a hammock a nd hung in a tree without much trouble. It is only necessary to secure the long poles firmly at their full width by a stout brace pole at the ends, letting the latter be deeply notched at the tips in order to receive the bed supports. The joints s hould then be tightly bound with stout twine in order to prevent slipping, afte r which the bed may be hung in mid-air by ropes at each end, and the tired trapper ma y swing himself to sleep with perfect comfort and safety. For this purpose the ropes should be attached at the joints, using a loop of six feet for each end. In the centre of this loop a small one should be made by doubling the rope and winding twine about it, leaving only a small aperture. Through these small loops, by the aid of other ropes, the bed is attached to the tree. By using this pr ecaution the unpleasant experience of being turned o r dum p ed out of bed will be im p ossible.

Bags of this sort are in common use among amateur tr appers, hunters and camping parties, and are very warm a nd comfortable. They should be nearly seven feet in length and of a \"loose, easy fit.\" With on e of these contrivances it is impossible to \"kick the clothes off\" and the warmth is c ontinual instead of \"intermittent,\" and even on the bare ground it is said to be sufficient protection. Hammocks are also in very general use, but we can confidently recommend the suspended bed above described as decidedly preferable. There are various kinds of hammocks in the market, from the light fibered silk, weighing only a few ounces, to the larg e corded variety of several pounds weight and capable of holding many persons . They are an esta blished article of trade, and as the details of their manufact ure would be of littl e practical use to the reader, we will leave th em without further consider ation. They can be had at almost any sporting emporium, at comparatively small cost. TENT CARPETING. We have described a most excellent contrivance for a bedstead and recommend its use whenever possible; but when the bed is desired to be made on the ground the following method is us ually employed, by which the whole interior of the tent, hut or shanty is carp eted with a soft, even covering of green. Spruce or hemlock boughs are generally us ed, and should be from the tips of the branches where the wood is not too large. Commence at the back part of the shelter, and lay down a row of the boughs with the butt of th e branch towards the front. Overlap these with another nearer row and continue the operation, laying the evergreen as even ly as possible until the w hole interior is smoothly covered. The projecting ends at the front, should now be secured by the weight of a medium sized log, or by a pole pegge d down firmly at in tervals. A similar log should now be laid at the back port ion of the shelter over the tips of the boughs after which the bed is complete, a nd will be found easy and comfortable in proportion to the care a nd skill shown in its constr uction. A blanket should be thrown over the boughs before reclining to rest, as the fresh green gives forth considerable dampness. If possible a rubber blanket should be used for this purpose. These consist of thick Canton flannel, coated on one side with Indian rubber, and are used with the rubber side down. They are warm and comfortable, and a valuable acquisition to the trapper's outfit. There is a thinner and cheaper variety, having equal water-proof qualities but which does not possess th e warmth of the former. Either will be found useful. So much for beds and bedding. If the reader will now turn hi s attention to the following section, \"The Tra pper's Miscellany,\" he will find much in detail of what has only been alluded to in the pres ent chapter, besides other hints of great value in reference to a tra pp in g cam p ai g n.

These often become a source of great annoyance to the woodsman, and more often a source of positive bodily suffering. Although trapping is not gene rally carried on during this season, the preparations for the coming campaign, including the bu ilding of shanties, transporting of traps, etc., are generally made at this time, and unless some preventive is used, the persecutions of the mosquitoes a nd other winged vermin, become almost unbearable. INSECT OINTMENTS. These insects seem to have a special aversion for the scent of pennyroyal‚Äîan herb growing commonly in sandy localities‚Äîand a si ngle plant rubbed upon the face and hands will often gr eatly check their attacks. The oil of pennyroyal is be tter, however, and an oint ment made by straining one ounce of the oil into two or three ounces of pur e melted lard, or mutton tallow, forms an excellent antidote. This may be carried in a little box or bottle, in the pocket, and applied as occasion re quires. Plain mutton tallow is also a most excellent ointment fo r general use, and in the case of bruise s or slight wounds, will give great relief. Another preparation in very co mmon use amongst hunters and woodsmen, although not quite as agreeable in odor, consists of a mixture of co mmon tar and sweet oil, in equal parts. By some this liniment is considered superior to the other, inasmuch as it also prevents ta nning, and is beneficial to the complexion. During the night time, the tent or sh anty often becomes swarmed with the winged pests, and their nocturnal assaults are proverbial for th eir pertinacity and severity. Their thirst for blood overcom es every other instinct, and pennyroyal often ceases to have an y effect. Our Adirondack guide, in narrating his experience with these ins ect vampires, even says that on a certain night, becoming exasperated at their indomitable perseverance, and, getting tired of the monotonous occupation of spre ading ointment, he aros e, lit his candle, and drove the creatures out of the tent. He then buttoned up the opening, and retired to rest. A storm came up in the night, and so comple tely had his canvas been riddled by the bills of the mosquitoes, th at the rain poured through his tent as through a sieve. We have heard of the man who, wh en pursued by hungry mosquitoes, took refuge beneath a large chal dron, and, by the aid of a stone, clinched the blood- thirsty bills as they protruded in que st of his life-bl ood, until, by the united efforts of the win g ed ca p tives, the chaldron was lifted and wafted out of si g ht, as Pa g e 256 Pa g e 188 of 240 Cam p Life in the Woods and the Tricks of Tra pp in g and Tra p Makin g 11/01/2006 file://C:\\Documents and Settin g s\\Stuart Gorin g \\M y Documents\\Cam p Life in the Woo..."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"if it were a feather. One story is just as true as the othe r, and a summer in the Adirondack woods will tend to strengthen, rather than diminish, the beli ef in either. The smoke of smouldering birch bark will effectually drive away the mosquitoes from the tents at night. Th is method is commonly known as \"the smudge,\" and is more full y described in another part of this work. The smell of the smoke is of ten unpleasant at first, but it is always preferable to the insect bites. Mosquitoes are not the only vampires which infest our wooded lands. The \"punkeys\" and \"midgets\" can outstrip them for voracity and the painful character of the wound which they inflict. The \"punke y,\" or \"black-fly,\" as it is called, is a small, black gnat, about the size of a garden ant, and the bite of the insect often results very seriously. The midget is a mi nute little creature, and is the most everlastingly sticky and exasperating pest in the catalogue of human torments. They fly in swarms of thousands, and go for their victim \"en masse\" and the face, hands and neck are so on covered as if with \"hay seed.\" They stick where they first light, and commence operations immediately. All endeavors to shake them off are fruitless, and their comb ined attacks are soon most painfully realized. Their bite s produce great redness and swelli ng, and the itching is most intolerable. Happily for the woodsman, the \"smudge\" and pe nnyroyal ointment are effectual preventives against the atta cks of both midgets a nd black flies, as well as mosquitoes; and no one who values his life or good looks sh ould venture on a woodland excursion in the summer m onths without a supply of this latter commodity. In conclusion, we would remark that, to the mos quito the blood of the intemperate seems to ha ve a special attraction, a nd anyone who wishes to enjoy comparative freedom fr om the attacks of these pe sts, should abstain from the use of alcoholic stimulants. It is a too prevalent idea among trappers that whiskey and rum are necessary adjuncts to a trapping campaign, and many a trapper would about as s oon think of leaving his tr aps at home as his whisky bottle. This is all a mistake. Anyone who has not suffic ient strength of constitution to withstand th e hardships and exposures of a trapping life, without the especial aid of stimulants, shoul d stay at home. We are now alluding to the habitual use of such stimulants. It is always well to be provided with a flask of whisky or brandy, in case of illness, but it should only be resorted to in such an event. For a mere chill, we recomme nd the use of red pepper tea. A simple swallow of this drink, (made simply by soaking a red pepper in a cup of hot water) will restore warmth much quic ker than three time s the amount of any alcoholic stimulant. It is not our purpose to extend into a lengthened temperance lecture, but only to discourag e the wide-spread idea that stimulants are necessities in the life of the trapper. Mi dgets, musquitoes and punkeys delight over a victim with alcohol in his veins, and while to a healthy subject the bites are of only brief annoyance, to the intemperate they of ten result in painful, obstinate sores. In addition to the various ointments use d, it is well to be provided with a head- net, such as we illustrate. Nets of this kind are specially ma de for sportsmen, and consist of a spiral wire framework, covere d with mosquito netting, and of such a size to slip easily on the head.

The following examples represent those in most general use. Perhaps the most common form of the \"rough and ready\" order of boats, is that called the‚Äî \"DUG-OUT,\" OR LOG CANOE. It's general appearance is well i ndicated by the accomp anying illustration. With the proper tools, one of these canoes is easily ma de. A sharp axe, an adze, a shaving knife, a round edged adze, a nd a small auger, are principally necessary; and a cross-cut saw, broad-axe, sledge, and large sized chisel, will also be found useful. In any case the log should not be much less than two fe et in diameter, perfectly sound, and free from knots. If this precaution is observed, the result will be all the more satisfactory, and the canoe can be cut so thin, as to render it a light burden; being easily carri ed on the shoulders. A pine log is generally chosen for a dug-out, on account of the lightness of the wood, and the ease with which it can be worked. Butternut, cottonwood and whitewood, are also excelle nt, and indeed almost a ny sound log of large size will answer the purpose. For a dug-out of good size, th e log should be ten or more feet in length. The first thing to be done is to cut a flat su rface on one side of the log, from end to end. This indicates the bo ttom of the canoe. On th e upper side the wood should be hewn away, in the curve shown on the upper outline of our illustration. It is well to divide the log by notches into three e qual lengths. In the centre division, the wood may be cut down to a st raight line to a de pth of about eight inches from the upper surfa ce. The gradual curve to the bow and stern of the canoe should start from each end of this flat cut, and extend to the upper edge of the log, the guiding line be ing made on the sides of th e log by a piec e of chalk. The adze will come into good use in trimming off the wood on these curves. When this upper outline is accomplishe d, the log may be turned bottom side up, and the sides of the extremities rounded off. This may be done with an axe and adze, and when performed, the bottom curves should be made by chopping away the wood in the curves shown in the lowe r outline of our illustration. This curve should also be marked out with chalk, and should co mmence a little nearer the end of the log than the curve on the uppe r side. Shave off the wood to a blunt edge on this curve, at both bow and stern. The rough fo rm of the canoe is now obtained, and by the aid of the draw-knife, or shaving-kni fe, it can be neatly and smoothly finished. It is then ready to be \" dug-out.\" The tools most usef ul for this purpose are the adze and axe, and sometimes the sledge an d chisel. The digging out is of course the most tedious part; but with sharp tools it is a comparatively easy matter. When the great bulk of the wood is take n out, the interior should be finished with a howel or round adze; and the sides may be worked to one inch and a half in thickness if desired. The writer once saw one of these canoes of most exquisite workmanship, being only one inch in thickness, and so light as to be easil y lifted with one hand. Of course such p erfection as this is not necessar y for Page 260 Pa g e 192 of 240 Cam p Life in the Woods and the Tricks of Tra pp in g and Tra p Makin g 11/01/2006 file://C:\\Documents and Settin g s\\Stuart Gorin g \\M y Documents\\Cam p Life in the Woo..."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"ordinary purposes; although where the canoe is expected to be carried any great distance, it is well to thin it as much as possible. A gimlet or small auger may be used to gauge the thickness of the canoe, using it in the following manner: Supposing the required thickness of the wood is two inches, proceed to bore the hole from the inside of the canoe , and continue until the point of the gimlet or auger barely ma kes its appearance on the outside. Draw out the tool, and if the thickness measures more than is required, insert into the hole a slender piece of wood exactly two in ches in length; push it in as far as it will go, and you may safely work until you reach the e nd of it. By this method the thickness may be gauged in different parts of the boat sufficiently to acquire a fair average thickness, and there is no danger of cutting through. The gimlet should be allowed to extend outside of the canoe only sufficiently to be detected, and the holes thus made will sel dom give any trouble as leak s. If, however, this should be the case, a little putty or pi tch will remedy the difficulty. The \"dug-out\" may be constr ucted of any size, and of any desired shape, but the above is the usual type. When leaks or cracks occur, they ma y be caulked with hemp, and smeared with pitch, which will render them thoroughly waterproof. For lightness and portability there is no boat more desirable or more unique than‚Äî THE INDIAN OR BIRCH-BARK CANOE. Where the white birch grows in perfection, and the trees attain a large size, the chief material of the birc h bark canoe is at hand; and although we ordinary mortals could not be expect ed to attain to that perfection of skill which the Indians exhibit in the manuf acture of these canoes, we nevertheless can succeed sufficiently well to answer all practical purposes. The Indian canoes are often perfect marvels of skill and combined strength and lightness. These half- civilized beings seem to ta ke as naturally to the maki ng of these commodities, as if it were almost an hereditary habit wi th them; and few men, even with the most exhaustive practice, can co mpete with the Indian in the combined result of strength, lightness, durability, external beauty, and nicety of work, which are the united characteristics of the typical bark canoe. The average length of the \"Bark,\" as used by trappers, is about twelve feet, but they may be constructed of any desired dimensions, to the length of forty feet. A canoe of this size will carry fifteen or twenty persons, and may be transported with ease upon the shoulders of two strong men. The sma ller size, above mentioned, is capable of carrying two pers ons, and is a light load for a single man. In constructing the bark canoe the fi rst requisite is the gunwale, or upper framework. This should consist of four strips of cedar, ash, or other light, strong wood; two for each side of the boat. Fo r an ordinary sized canoe, their length should be about twelve fe et, width one inch, and thickness one-quarter of an inch. They should be tied together in pa irs at the ends, and the two pairs then joined at the same place. Th e object of these pieces is to give strength and form to the canoe, and to offer a firm securi ty for the edges of the bark, which are secured between them.

The bottom of a well made canoe should be in one large piece, as our illustration indicates, if possible. Select some larg e tree with th e trunk free from knots or excrescences. Mark off as great a length as possible, and chop a straight cut in the bark through the w hole length of the pi ece, after which it should be carefully peeled from the wood. It will so metimes happen, where large birches exist in perf ection, that a single pi ece may be found of sufficient size for a whole canoe, but this is rather excepti onal, and the bottom is generally pieced out, as seen in our drawin g. This piecing may be accomp lished with an awl and Indian twine, or by the aid of a large need le threaded with the same, sewing with an over-and-over stitch around the edge of each piece. Use as large pieces as are attainable, and continue to sew them on until the arca of ba rk measures about four and a half feet in wi dth by twelve feet in length, the dark colored sides of the bark all facing the same way. Next select a fiat piece of ground, and mark off a distance of ten feet, or two feet less than the le ngth of the gunwales. At each end of the space two tall st akes should be driven in to the ground about three inches apart. Now turn the bark on the ground with its white side uppermost, and fold it loosely and evenly through the l ong centre. In this folded condition it should now be lifted by the upper edge and set between the stakes. There will then be about a foot of projecting bark beyond each pair of stakes. These ends should now be covered by folding another piece of bark over them, sewing the edges firmly to the sides of the rude form of the canoe, which now presents itself. When this is done, each end should be supported on a log or stone; this will cause the bottom line to sink downwar ds at about the proper curve. We are now ready for the gunwale. Lay it in the proper position, fitting the edges of the bark between the two strips on each si de, and sewing around the whole with a winding stitch, exactly after th e manner of the edge of an ordinary palm-leaf fan. The inside of the canoe should now be lined with long stri ps of cedar running through the entire length of the boat if poss ible, but if not, should be so cut as to neatly overlap at the ends. These pieces should be an inch or two in width, and from a quarter to half an inch-in thickness. The ribs are then to be put in. These are generally made from ash, one or two inches in width, and a quarter of an inch in thickness. Any light flexible w ood will answer th e purpose, and even barrel hoops when attainable will do very well. These ribs should be bent to fit the interior of the canoe crosswise, either close together, or with equal distances between them and the ends should then be firmly secured beneath the gunwales by a continuous loop-stitch through the bark. For a ca noe of twelve feet in length, the width should be about two feet , and in order to keep the gunwales firm, two or more cross-piece s should be inserted, and lash ed firmly at their ends as our illustration shows. The centre third of the length of the canoe should be parallel at the sides, and if two braces, two feet in length are placed at each end of this third, the shape will be about perfect. We now have a bark canoe of considerable strength and dur ability, and it only awaits to be made water-proof for final use. In or der to accomplish this all th e seams outside, and the entire interior of the canoe should, be smeare d with pitch, after which its floating qualities may be tested wi th confidence. Should any leaks occur their where- abouts are easily detected, and an additional applicati on of pitch will remedy the difficulty. The Indians in sewing their ba rk canoes use tamarack roots, fibrous plants, and grasses, in lieu of thread, and even with th ese inferior materials often attain to such perfection in compact sewing, as to render the use of pitch unnecessary for water-proof pur poses. Such skill is rarely attained by the white man, and the art of making a water-proof canoe, even out of a single piece of bark, is by no means an easy task without the aid of tar or pitch. For the trapper we strongly recomme nd the birch \"bark.\" With the above directions we are sure no one could g o astra y , and we are e q uall y sure that a Pa g e 263 Pa g e 264 Pa g e 194 of 240 Cam p Life in the Woods and the Tricks of Tra pp in g and Tra p Makin g 11/01/2006 file://C:\\Documents and Settin g s\\Stuart Gorin g \\M y Documents\\Cam p Life in the Woo..."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"canoe made as we describe, would present advantages of lightness and portability which no othe r style of boat would posse ss.

The boa rd thus shaped should now be laid evenly on the other, and the outline of the cut portions carefully scratched upon it, after which the second board should be cut in a similar manner as the first, so as to form an exact duplicate. This being accomplished, the two should be laid evenly, one over the other, and the exact center of their long edges ascertaine d.

This is shown at ( a ), and consists of a solid piece of oak, or other hard wood, well seasoned, and hewn out in the arrow shape, indicated in our illustration. It should first be cut three-co rnered, the inside face being about eight inches, and the other two ten inches. It s length should be about eleven inches, and its under side should be sloped off on a line with the under curve of the bows. At about five inches from the i nner face, and on each side, a piece should be sawn out, one inch in thickness, thus leaving on each side a notch which will exactly receive the side-boards of the boat, as seen at ( a ). The piece being thus ready, the bow e nds of the boards should be drawn together, fitted in the notches and secure ly spiked with large nails. A bow piece of this kind adds greatly to the stre ngth of a boat, and will stand much rough usage. The board for the stem should next be prepared. This should be ten inches in width and two feet in length, and shoul d be securely nailed between the ends of the boards at the stem, as shown at ( g ), being afterwards overlapped on the top by a board of similar size, as our illustration shows, at ( c ). The bottom of the boat is now easily made by nailing board s crosswise, sawing off the projecting ends close to the curve of th e side-boards. After the pieces are all nailed in place, the seams and crevices should be caulked with hemp, using a blunt chisel, or hard wooden wedge, and a ma llet. The seats should now be put in, as these are not only a matter of comfort, but of nece ssity, acting as braces to the sides of the boat. They should be two in number, one being placed three feet from the stern and the other one foot beyond the brace board originally nailed across the top of the boat.

Small cleats should now be tacked to the bottom of the boat, beneath the seat and underneath the seat itself, in order to keep the props in place; after which th e original brace board across the top of the boat may be knocked off and the bateau is complete and ready for service. A boat thus made is quite comely in shape, and may be painted to suit the fancy. Should a rudder be required, the broad boa rd at the stern offers a good place of attachment, and oar-locks may be adjust ed at the proper places. These may consist of a pair of cleats attached to the inside of the boat, as seen in the illustration. In case it may be found difficult to obtain the larg e single boards for the sides of the boat, two or more narr ow ones will answer the purpose, although not as perfectly. In this ca se they should first be firmly attached together by cleats, securely screwed to the inside. When first put on the water the boat will probably leak in places, but if left to soak for a few hours the wood will generally swell sufficiently to complete ly close the crevices. If, however, the leak should continue, that particular pa rt of the boat should be re-caulked and smeared with pitch. This latt er substance is of great value to the trapper, not only in boat building but in the construction of his shanties and in other various ways. It will most effectually st op almost any leak in a canoe or boat, and of course should always be applied hot. THE SCOW. The bateau we have above described is built so as to allow for considerable speed in the water, either in rowing or sculling; but where this speed is not especially desired the pointed bows may be dispensed with, a nd the sides of the boat made perfectly straight . In this case the bottom ta kes equal slopes at the ends, and both bow and ster n are of the same width, and an ordinary flat- bottomed boat with parallel si des is the result. In many cases a scow of this kind answers every purpose, and is cert ainly much more easily made. We have thus desc ribed a few of the most comm on instances of boats used by trappers, and with our full description and illustrations no one can go astray. A boat of some kind is almost an indispensable requisite to the trapper, and anyone of the foregoing will be found suffic ient for all ordinary purposes. A paddle may be used, and in shallow or muddy water a pus her or mud-stick will be found useful. This s hould consist of a pole seve n or eight feet in length, supplied at the ends with an attachment of the shape of the letter U. This may be constructed in two pieces, firmly screwe d to opposite sides of the end of the pole, and so formed as to present a curved crotch. Such a stick will be found very useful for pushi ng through weeds and muddy places. A simple pole trimmed so as to leave a crotch at th e end will also answ er the purpose very well. SNOW-SHOES. These commodities are almost indispensa ble to the trapper where he pursues his vocation in the winter time, during the prevalence of deep snows. When properly made they permit the wearer to walk over the surface of the snow with perfect ease; where, without them, travel would be ex tremely difficult if not im p ossible.

In the latter localities the \"snow-shoe race\" forms one of the favor ite sports of the season, and young and old alike join in its mysteries. Like riding on the velocipede, walking on snow-shoes looks \"easy enough,\" but we notice that a fe w somersaults are usually a convincing argument that the art is not as simple as it appears. The first experience on snow- shoes is apt to be at l east undignifying, if not discour aging, and in order to get used to the strange capers and eccentricitie s of an ordinarily well-behaved snow shoe, it requires considerable patience and practice. Ther e is no telling where, in an unguarded moment, they will land you, and they seem to take especial delight in stepping on each other and turning th eir wearer upside do wn. The principal secret of success (and one ma y as well know it at the start, as to learn it at the expense of a pint of snow down his back) consists in taking steps sufficiently long to bring the widest po rtion of the stepping shoe beyond that of the other, keeping the feet rather fa r apart and stepping pre tty high. By observing these precautions, and trusting in Providence, much embarrassment may be saved, and an hour's effort will thor oughly tame the unruly appe ndages, which at best do not permit of much grace or elegance of gait. To the moose hunter snow-shoes are ofte n an absolute necessity, and trapping in many cases would be impossible without them. They are thus brought fully within the scope of our volume, and we give a few simple directions for their manufacture. Our illustration gives the co rrect shape of the shoe. The framework should consist of a strip of ash, hickory or some other elastic wood, bent into the form indicated and wound around the ends with twine or stri ps of hide. The length of the piece should be about six fe et, more or less, in proportion to the size of the individual who proposes to wear the shoe. If the bending should prove difficult it may be rendered an easy matter by the a pplication of boiling water. Across the front part two strips of stout leather, or other tough hide, are then fastened, and these further secured t ogether by three or four bands on each side of the middle, as our drawing shows. In the original Indian snow-shoe, from which our drawing was made, the net work was constructe d from strips of moose hide , which were interlaced much after the manner of an ordinary cane-seated chair. Strips of leather, deer skin, or even split cane, above allude d to, may also be used, an d the lacing may be either as our illustration represents, or in the si mpler rectangular woof seen in ordinary cloth. In order to attach the interlacing to the bow the latter should be wound with wide strips of cane, if it can be procur ed, or otherwise with strips of tough skin. The loops thus formed offer a continuous security, and the w hole interior, with the exception of the space at the front be tween the cross pieces , should be neatly filled with the next work. It is well to run the first lines across the shoe, from side to side, passing through the windings of the bow. Across them, in the form of the letter X, the two other cords should be interl aced, after the manner shown Pa g e 268 Pa g e 269 Pa g e 199 of 240 Cam p Life in the Woods and the Tricks of Tra pp in g and Tra p Makin g 11/01/2006 file://C:\\Documents and Settin g s\\Stuart Gorin g \\M y Documents\\Cam p Life in the Woo..."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"in the cut. This forms a secure and no t very complicated network, and is the style usually adopted by the Indian makers. There is another mode of attaching th e lace-work to the bow which is also commonly employed, and consists in a seri es of holes bored at regular intervals through the wood. The winding is thus disp ensed with, but the bow is sometimes weakened by the operation, and we are inclined to recommend the former method in preference. In at taching the shoe, the ball of the foot should be set on the second cross piece, and th ere secured by a strip of hide, which should be first adjusted as seen in the engraving, bei ng afterward tied over the foot and then behind the ankle. Snow-shoes are made in other ways, but we believe that the typical Indian snow-shoe above described is the best. THE TOBOGGAN OR INDIAN SLEDGE. For winter traffic over deep snows there is no better sled in the world than the Indian toboggan. To the trapper during a winter campaign it is often an indispensable convenience, and without it the Indian hunters of the North would find great difficulty in getting their furs to market. All through the winter season the various trading posts of Canada are constantly visi ted by numbers of Indian trappers, many of whom ha ve travelled hundreds of mi les on thei r snow-shoes with their heavily laden toboggans. Arrived at their ma rket they sell or trade their stock of furs, and li kewise dispose of their t oboggans, reserving only their snow-shoes to aid them in their long tram p homewards. In Canada and northward the toboggan is in very extensive use, both for purposes of traffic and amusement. It is quite commonly met with in the streets of various Canadian cities, and is especially appreciated by the youthful population, who are fond of co asting over the crust of snow. For this purpose there is no other sled like it , and a toboggan of the size we shall describe will easily accommodate two or three boys, and will glide ove r a crust of snow with great ease and rapidity. To the trapper it is especially valuable for all purposes of transportation. The flat bottom rests upon the surface of the snow, and the weight being thus distributed a load of two or three hundr ed pounds will often make but little impression and can be drawn with marvellous ease. Our illustration gives a very clear idea of the sled, and it can be made in the following way: the fi rst requisite is a board about ei ght feet in length and sixteen or more inches in width. Su ch a board may be procured at any saw mill. Oak is the best wood for the purpose, although hickory, basswood or ash will do excellently. It should be planed or sawe d to a thickness of about a third of an inch, and should be free from knots. If a single board of the requi red width is not easil y found, two boards ma y be used, and secured side b y side b y three cleats, Pa g e 270 Pa g e 200 of 240 Cam p Life in the Woods and the Tricks of Tra pp in g and Tra p Makin g 11/01/2006 file://C:\\Documents and Settin g s\\Stuart Gorin g \\M y Documents\\Cam p Life in the Woo..."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"one at each end and the ot her in the middle, using wrought nails and clinching them deeply into the board on the under side. The single board is much to be preferred, if it can be had. The next re quisites are seven or eight wooden cross- pieces of a length equivalent to the width of the boa rd. Four old broom-sticks, cut in the required lengths, will answer this purpose perfectly, and if these are not at hand other sticks of similar dime nsions should be used. Two side pieces are next needed. These should be about five feet in length, and in thickness exactly similar to the cross pieces. Next procure a few pair s of leather shoe- strings or some strips of tough calf ski n. With these in readiness we may now commence the work of putting the part s together. Begin by laying the cross pieces at equal distances al ong the board; across these and near their ends lay the two side pieces, as seen in the illustrati on. By the aid of a gimlet or awl, four holes should now be made through the bo ard, beneath the end of each cross piece, and also directly under the side piece. It is well to mark with a pencil, the various points for the holes, after which the sticks can be removed and the work much more easily performed. The four holes should be about an inch apart, or so disposed as to mark the f our corners of a square inc h. It is also necessary to make other holes along the length of the cr oss pieces, as seen in the illustration. The line on these can also be marked with the pencil across the board, and the holes made afterwards. Thes e should also be an inch apart, and only two in number at each point, one on each side of the stick. Wh en all the holes are made the board should be turned over, in orde r to complete preparations on the other side. The object of these various holes is for the passage of the leather shoe- strings for the purpose of securing the cros s pieces firmly to the board. In order to prevent these loops from wearing of f on the under side, small grooves should next be made connecting th e holes beneath, thus allo wing the leather string to sink into the wood, where it is securely protected from in jury. A narrow chisel is the best tool for this purpose, the maki ng of the grooves being much more easily and perfectly accomplished wi th this than with the jack-knife. When the under side is thus finished the board may be turned over and the cross pieces and sides again arranged in place as already descri bed. Secure the pieces to the board by the leather strings through the vari ous holes, always knotting on the upper surface, and taking care that the knots are firmly tie d. The ends of all the cross pieces will require a double cross stitch through the four holes beneath, in order to secure the side pieces as well. This is plainly shown in the small diagram ( a ). The front end of each side piece underneath should now be shar pened to a point, to allow for the bend at th e front of the toboggan. The cross piece at this end should be secured to the unde r side of the board, so that as it bends over it will appear on the upper edge, as our illustration shows. The board should next be bent with a graceful curve, and thus held in position by a rope or strip of leather at each extremity of the end cross piece and attached to the ends of the third cross piece, as seen in th e engraving. If the bending is difficult and there is danger of breaking the board , the application of boil ing water will render it pliable. The draw st rings should then be attached to the ends of the second cross piece, and our toboggan is now complete. It may now be laden with two or three hundred pounds of merchandize and will be found to draw over the surface of the snow with perfect ease. For coasting over the crust there is nothing like it. Such a toboggan as we have described will easily accommodate thr ee boys, the one at the stern being provided with a sharp stick for steering, and the front oc cupant holding firmly to the draw strings. The toboggan is easily made, and will do good service either for traffic or s p ort.

This department of the tra pper's art is one of the mo st important and necessary, as affecting pecuniary prof its. The value of a skin in the fur market depends entirely upon the care with wh ich it is taken from th e animal and afterward prepared, and without a knowle dge on this subject the young trapper will in vain seek for high prices for his furs. Large quantities of valu able skins are sent to our markets annually by inexperienced amateu r trappers, and in many cases rare and beautiful furs have been almost spoiled by want of care in skinning and curing. The rules are simple and easily followed, a little care being all that is necessary to insure most perfect success. In every case the skin should be removed shortly after death, or at least before it has become tainted with decay. Great pains should be taken in skinning. Avoid the adhe rence of flesh or fat to the skin, and guard against cutting through the hide, as a pierced sk in is much injured in value. The parts about the eyes, legs and ears should be car efully removed. The various methods of skinning are described in our sect ion on trapping, and in all cases the furs should be allowed to dry in a cool, airy place, fre e from the rays of the sun or the heat of a fire , and protected from rain. Astringent preparations of various kinds are used by many trappers, but they are by no means necessary. The most common dressing consists of equal parts of rock salt and alum dissolved in water. Into this a sufficient amount of coarse flour or wheat bran is stir red to give the mixture the consistency of batter, after which it is spread thickly over the skin and allowed to dry. It is afterwards scraped off, and in some cases a second a pplication is made. This preparation is much used in dressi ng beaver, otter, mink and muskrat skins, but as many of our most successful and experienced trappers do without it, we fail to see the advantage of using it, as it is only an extra tr ouble. The simplest and surest way is to stretch the skin a nd to submit it to a gradual process of natural drying without any artif icial heat or application of astringents to hasten the result. A very common mode of stretching skins consists in tacking them to a board, with the fur inwards, and allowing th em to dry as already described. This method does very well for small skins, but for general purposes the \"stretchers\" are the only means by whic h a pelt may be properly cured and prepared. STRETCHERS. The board stretcher is the simplest form and is in most common use among trappers for the smaller animals. These st retchers are of two kinds, the plain and the wedged. The plain stretcher consists of a piece of board a quarter of an inch in thickness, about eighteen inches long an d six inches in widt h. One end of this board is rounded off, as seen in our ill ustration, and the sides should also be whittled and smoothed to a blunt edge. The board stretchers are used onl y for those skins which are taken off whole, Pa g e 273 Pa g e 202 of 240 Cam p Life in the Woods and the Tricks of Tra pp in g and Tra p Makin g 11/01/2006 file://C:\\Documents and Settin g s\\Stuart Gorin g \\M y Documents\\Cam p Life in the Woo..."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"that is, as described in the chapter on the otter. The skin should be drawn tightly over the blunt end of the board, and its edges ei ther caught in notches cut in the edges of the square end or secu red by a few tacks. This stretcher is particularly adapted to the skins of musk rats, minks and animals of a like size. They are known in New Engl and as \"shingle stretchers ,\" and are much to be recommended on account of their lightness and the ease with wh ich they can be made and carried. The wedge stretcher is rather more elaborate than the foregoing, and is said to be an improvement. The first requisite is a board of about three-eighths of an inch in thickness, two feet or more in length, a nd three and a half inches at one end tapering to the width of two inches at th e other. This end should no w be rounded, and the edges of the board whittled off to a blunt edge, as already described in the foregoing, commencing near the centre of the board, and thinning to the edge, and finishing with the notches at the square end. Now, by the aid of a rip-saw, sever the board through the middle lengthwise. The wedge is the next thing to be cons tructed, and should cons ist of a piece of wood the thickness of the centre of the board and of the same length, tapering from an inch in width at one end to half an inch at the other. To use the stretcher the two boards are inse rted into the skin, (the latter with the fur side inward). The wedge is then inserted between the large ends of the boards and driven in sufficiently to stretch the pelt to its full capacity, securing it in the notches by slight cuts in the hide, or by a tack or two at the edge. It should then he hung in a cool, airy place, and the pelt left to \"season.\" The bow stretcher is another contrivanc e very commonly used for small skins like the foregoing. When this is used th e pelt should be skinned as described on page 185 , the initial cut commencing at the lower jaw and extending down between the fore legs, all the feet being previously cut off. The bow may consist of a switch of any elastic wood such as hickory iron wood, elm or birch. It should be about three or mo re feet in length, and as la rge as a man's thumb at the butt end. By bending it in the shape of the letter U it may easil y be inserted in the skin, the latter being fa stened by catching the lip on each side into a sliver notch cut on each end of the bow , as our illustration indicates.

THE HOOP STRETCHER. This consists of a hoop made from one or more flexible switches tied together so as to form a circle. In order to be adapted to this mode of stretching, the skin should be flat, i. e. taken off as described on page 172 , the initial cut extending from the lower jaw to the vent. The size of the hoop required depends upon the dimensions of the skin. La y the latter upon some flat surface and so gauge the hoop as that it shall surround the pelt on all sides; af ter which the latter should be secured or l aced to the hoop with twine at the edges. All loose parts should be drawn up, and the skin shoul d everywhere be stretched like a drum head. When this is accomplished it is the custom wi th many trappers to apply the preparation described on page 273 , particularly where the skin is thick and fatty. But we are rather disposed to discourage the use of any preparation whatever, in any case, as they are by no means necessary. In using the board stretchers the fur s hould always be on the inside, and when the hoop or bow is used it should be placed in such a position, that the air may circulate freely on both sides of the sk in, which should not be removed until thoroughly dry. TANNING SKINS. In case some of our readers might desire to tan fur skins fo r their own domestic purposes, the subjoined directions will be found to be reliable, and for all ordinary requirements, sufficiently adequate. For tanning with the hair on, the skin shoul d first be cleaned, every particle of loose fat or flesh, being removed, and the useless parts cut away. When this is done, it should be soaked for an hour or two in warm water. The following mixture should then be prepared: Take equal parts of borax, saltpetre, and sulphate of soda, and with them mix wa ter sufficient to produce the consistency of thin batter. This p re p aration should be p ainted thickl y on the flesh side of the skin, after Pa g e 276 Pa g e 204 of 240 Cam p Life in the Woods and the Tricks of Tra pp in g and Tra p Makin g 11/01/2006 file://C:\\Documents and Settin g s\\Stuart Gorin g \\M y Documents\\Cam p Life in the Woo..."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"which these sides should be doubled together and the pelt left in an airy place. A second mixture should next be prepare d. This should consis t of two parts sal soda; three parts borax; four parts castile or other hard soap: all to be melted together over a slow fire. At the end of twenty-four hours, af ter the application of the first mixture, the second should be applied in a similar manner, and the fur again folded and left for the same length of time. Ne xt, make a mixture equal parts of salt and alum, diss olved in warm water and th ickened with coarse flour to the consistency of thin paste. Spread this thickly over the skin and allow it to dry, after which it should be scraped off with the bowl of a spoon. The skin should be tightly stretche d during the operation, in or der to prevent too great shrinkage. A single applicatio n of the last-named dressi ng, is generally sufficient for small skins; but a second or third treat ment may be resorted to if required, to make the skin soft and pliable, after wh ich it should be finished off with sand- paper and pumice stone. A skin may be thus dressed as soft as velvet, and the alum and salt will se t the hair securely. The above directions are excellent, for all general purposes, but we subjoin, in addition, a few other valuab le hints and specific reci pes in common use. Every trapper has his own peculiar hobby in rega rd to his tanning process, and the recipes are various and extensive. The a bove is one of the most reliable for general use. A common mode of tanning mi nk and muskrat skins is given in the following:‚Äî TO TAN MINK AND MUSKRAT SKINS. Before tanning, the skin should always be thoroughly cleansed in warm water, and all fat and superfluous flesh removed. It should then be immersed in a solution made of the followin g ingredients: Five gallons of cold soft water; five quarts wheat bran; one gill of salt; and one ounce of sulphuric acid. Allow the skins to soak in the liquid for four or five hours. If the hides have been previously salted, the salt should be excluded from the mixed solution. The skins are now ready for the tanning liquor, which is made in the following way: into five gallons of warm, soft water, stir one peck of wheat bran and allow the mixture to stand in a warm room until fermentation ta kes place. Then add three pints of salt, and stir unt il it is thoroughly dissolve d. A pint of sulphuric acid should then be poured in gradually, after which the liquor is ready. Immerse the skins and allow them to soak for three or four hours. The process of \"fleshing\" is then to be resorted to. This consists in laying the skin, fu r side down, over some smooth beam, and working over the flesh si de with a blunt fl eshing tool. An old chopping knife, or tin candlestick, forms an excellent substitute for the ordinary fleshing knife, and the process of rubbi ng should be continued until the skin becomes dry, after which it will be found to be soft and pliable. The skin of the muskrat is quite tender, and the fles hing should be carefu lly perfor med. HOW TO TAN THE SKINS OF BE AVER, OTTER, RACCOON, AND MARTEN. These should be stretched on a board and smeared with a mixture composed of three ounces each, of salt and alum; three gills of water, and one drachm of sulphuric acid. This should be thickened w ith wheat bran or flour, and should be allowed to dry on the ski n, after which it should be scraped off with a spoon. Next, take the skin from the board, roll it with the fur inside, an d draw it q uickl y Pa g e 277 Pa g e 205 of 240 Cam p Life in the Woods and the Tricks of Tra pp in g and Tra p Makin g 11/01/2006 file://C:\\Documents and Settin g s\\Stuart Gorin g \\M y Documents\\Cam p Life in the Woo..."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"backward and forward, over a smooth peg, or through an iron ring. The skin should then be unfolded and rolled again the oppos ite way, and the operation repeated until the pelt is quite soft and flexible. This is a good way of softening all kinds of skins, and the above prep aration will be f ound excellent for all ordinary purposes. The muskra t skin may be treated in the same manner as the above, if desired, and the process direct ed on the muskrat skin may also be applied to the pelts of the other animals. To remove the fur for a simple tanned sk in, the hide should be immersed in a liquid composed of‚Äîsoft water, five gall ons; slaked lime, four quarts; and wood ashes, four quarts. Allow the skin to soak for a couple of days, after which the fur will readily slip off. Another method‚Äîtake equal parts wood as hes and slaked lime, and add water to the consistency of batter. Spread this over the inside of th e skin, roll it up, and place it in a pail, covering it with water. Here let it re main from one to five days, or until the hair will shed easily, after which it s hould be finished with the fleshing knife and velvet ed with sand paper. OBSERVATIONS ON THE HISTORY OF FURS AND THE FUR TRADE. In all cold climates, man has availed himself liberally of the warm covering with which nature has clothed the anim als around him; but th e wealth of the most favored nations has draw n to them the most beautifu l furs, in whatever part of the world they are procured. Skins of animals were among the first materials used for clothing. Before Adam and Eve we re driven from the Garden of Eden, they were furnished with coats of skin s. The ancient Assyrians used the soft skins of animals to cover the couches or the ground in thei r tents, and the Israelites employed badger's skins and ra m's skins, as orna mental hangings for the Tabernacle. The ancient heroes of the Greeks and Romans, are represented as being clothed in skins. √Üneas, weari ng for an outer garmen t, that of the lion, and Alcestes being formidably clad in th at of the Libyan Bear . Herodotus speaks of those living near the Caspian Sea weari ng seal skins, and C√¶s ar mentions that the skin of the reindeer formed in part the clothing of the Ge rmans. In the early period, furs appear to have constitute d the entire riches of the Northern countries, and they were almost the only exports. Taxes were paid on them, and they were the medium of exchange. So it was also in our ow n Western territories in the latter part of the last century, and is to the present day, to a great extent, among the Indians. In the eleventh cen tury, furs had become fashionable throughout Europe, and the art of dyeing th em, was practiced in the twelfth. In the history of the Crusad es, frequent mention is made of the magnificent displays by the European Prin ces, of their dresses of cost ly furs, before the Court at Constantinople. But Richard I. of Engla nd, and Philip II. of France, in order to check the growing extravagance in their use, resolved that the choicer furs, ermine and sable amongst the number, should be omitted from their kingly wardrobes. Louis IX. followed their exampl e in the next century, but not until his extravagance had grow n to such a pitch, that seven hundred and forty-six ermines were required for the lining of one of his surcoats . In the times, the use of the choicer furs, as thos e of the sable, ermine, gr is, and Hungarian squirrel, was restricted to the roya l families and the nobility, to whom they served as distinctive marks and badges of rank. Th ese privileged persons applied them lavishly to their own use, and the fash ion extended to the pr inces of other less civilized nations. Their ro y al use soon extended to Tartar y , and the tents of the Pa g e 278 Pa g e 279 Pa g e 206 of 240 Cam p Life in the Woods and the Tricks of Tra pp in g and Tra p Makin g 11/01/2006 file://C:\\Documents and Settin g s\\Stuart Gorin g \\M y Documents\\Cam p Life in the Woo..."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Khan were bedecked with the most ri ch and costly furs. In the following century, furs were commonl y worn in England until their use was prohibited by Edward III., to all persons whose purse would not warrant a yearly expenditure of ¬£100. The early fur trade of Western Europe , was conducted th rough the merchants on the south coast of the Baltic, who re ceived goods from th e ports of Livonia. In the sixteenth century, a direct tr ade was opened between the English and Russians; and a company of the former , protected by the Czar, established trading posts on the White Sea, and a wa rehouse at Moscow, whence they sent trading parties to Persia and the countries on the Caspian Sea. The Czar sent rich presents of beautiful furs , to Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth; but the latter prohibited the wearing of any but native furs, and the trade soon declined and was abandoned. In the 17th century, Sibe ria was conquered by the Russians, and its tribute was paid in furs. Large quantitie s were also furnished to China, but the choicest kinds‚Äîthe precious ermine, the brilliant, fiery f oxes, and the best sables, were taken to Mosc ow, for the use of the princes and nobles of Russia, Turkey, and Persia. In our own country, the early settlers of the Northe rn provinces, soon learned the value of the furs of the numerous animals which peopled the extensive rivers, lakes, and forests of these vast territories. They collected the skins in abundance, and found an incr easing demand for them, with every new arrival of immigrants from the mother country. Tri nkets, liquors, and ot her articles sought for by the native tribes, were shipped to Quebec, and from thence up the St. Lawrence to Montreal, which soon became th e great trading post of the country. The various tribes of Indians were stim ulated by trifling compensation, to pursue their only congenial and peaceful occupati on; and the French settlers, readily assimilating to the Indian habits, became themselves e xpert hunters, trappers, and explorers. The business prospered, and the English soon became interested and secured a share of the valuable trade. Many weal thy and influential parties, connected with the government of Gr eat Britain,‚ÄîPrince Rupert and Lord Ashley, among the number‚Äîbecame deeply interested in this source of revenue; and after a successful enterprise, they obtained from Charles II., a charter of incorporation, giving to them full possession of the te rritory within the entrance of Hudson's Straits, not already granted to other subj ects, or possessed by those of any other Christian prince or State. In this char ter was included the m onopoly, of all trade in these regions, and thus we see the origin of the Great Hudson's Bay Company, which is to-day, one of the largest or ganizations of its kind on the globe. The territory they claimed, extended from H udson's Bay, west to the Pacific, and north to the Arctic Ocean, excepting that occupied by the French and Russians. They soon formed settlements upon the various rivers which empty into Hudson's Bay, and carried on their opera tions with immense vigor and success. They met with much opposition and open hostility from the French, and were subjected to vast expenses and losses, but in spite of all, they continued to prosper. Their forts or factories were exte nded further into the interior of British America, and their power was supreme throughout the country, and in a great measure over the Indians, whom they em ployed to collect their skins. In the course of time, the French Canadians organized them selves into a united band, under the name of the Nort h West Company, and estab lished their headquarters at Montreal. Their operations were carried on with great energy and profit, and man y factories were built in the western p ortion of the Province.

This condition of affairs finally terminat ed in a consolidation of the two organizations, under the name of the H udson's Bay Company, the privileges of which extended over all the territ ory formerly occupied by both. Thus, we have the history of the fa mous Hudson's Bay Company, from its origin to its perfect orga nization. It is a most stupe ndous concern, and its annual shipment of furs, is something amazi ng. Their great sales take place in the month of March, in order to be co mpleted before Easter; and again in September, every year at London, and ar e attended by purchaser s from nearly all parts of the world. Leipsic, the famous fur mart of Germany, is also the scene of a great annual fair, for the sale of skins. The importance of the fur trade in this c ountry, led to the ea rly settlement of the Western territories of the United St ates; and many a front ier city, like St. Paul, has been built up by th e enterprise of the trappe r. Mackinaw and Montreal owe much of their growth to the traf fic of the fur trade; and many a kingly fortune‚ÄîJohn Jacob Astor's, for inst ance‚Äîhas been founded on peltry. Besides the above fur sales in London a moderate portion of those annually collected in the United States are re tained for use, amounting to about 150,000 mink and 750,000 muskrat skins, besides a number of other furs which are manufactured and worn. The annual yield of raw fu rs throughout the whole world is estimated at over twenty millions of dollars in value; and when we include the manufactured articles therefrom, the amo unt will swell to a hundred mi llions or over. This will serve to give some idea of the immensity and value of the business. American dealers divide our native furs into two classes, viz., home and shipping furs; the former being chiefly util ized in our own country, while the latter are exported to all pa rts of the world. New York C ity is the great fur mart and depot for the shipping trade in this country, and the a nnual value of its exports, in this one branch of trade is enormous. The principal shipping furs are the silver, red a nd cross Fox, Wild Cat, Raccoon, Fisher, Muskrat and Skunk. Among the home furs are th e Marten, Mink, Opossum, Wolf and Muskrat, the latter being extensively us ed both here and abroad. In the following chapter will be f ound more detailed not es on the leading American furs, including their various uses and the different countries for which they are the especial staples. In order to give the reader some idea of the variety and magnitude of the yield of furs from our own countr y, we annex a table (p. 282) showing the sales of the Hudson's Bay Company, at London, in the year 1873.

The quotations are those of one of our larges t fur dealers, as publishe d in \"THE HAT, CAP AND FUR TRADE REVIEW,\" the lead ing journal of the trade in America. Of course these values are constantly varying‚Äîke eping pace with the eccentricities of fashion and the demands of the fur trade; but the table will serve at least to gauge the relative values, as between the two extremes of common and scarce furs. The fur market is a great deal li ke the stock market. It is constantly fluctuating, and a fur which is to-day among the novelties, may next year find itself on the low priced list. The demand for furs of any kind is nearly always governed by fashion, and of course the value is estimated on the demand. If the convention of fur dealers s hould decide to usher in Muskrat fur as the leading and most fashionable article in that line, the fash ion would creat e the demand, the demand would be in turn supplied by the trappers throughout the country, and in proportion as the Muskrat skins became scarce, so their value would increase. In this way a skin which may be worth fifty cents at one time may soon acquire a value of twenty times that am ount. The comparative value of skins is, therefore, constantly varying more or less; but the annexed table ( page 283 ) will be found useful for general reference, a nd for approximate figures, will probably answer every purpose for some time to come.

Like every other business, the fur trade runs in its regul ar grooves, and the av erage furrier will often pay an experienced pr ofessional five dollars for a skin for which he would not offer a dollar to an amateur. Th is certainly seems discouraging, but the knowledge of the fact is calculated to prevent greater discouragement. We often see fancy prices advertised by fur dealers for firs t-class skins; but when the furs are sent, onl y a few are selected as \" prime ,\" the rest being rejected as worthless, or perhaps meeting with a meagre offer far below the regular rates. In this way the dealers have the oppor tunity of choice selection without incurring any risk. Many a young trapper has been thus disappointed, and has seen his small anticipated fortune dw indle down to very small proportions. The fur trade is supplied through regular professional channels; and in giving our advice to the novice, we would reco mmend as the most satisfactory and profitable plan that he should make his sales to some local hunter or trapper, who has had experience with the fur trad e, and who is satisf ied to pay a fair price for the various skins wi th the probability of selling at an advance, and thus realizing a profit. In nearly every trapping locality such men are to be found, and although the prices earned may be below the market rates, the amateur takes none of the speculative risks of the busin ess, and should be willing to take lower prices on this account. AMERICAN FUR SKINS‚ÄîTHEIR US ES AT HOME AND ABROAD. In the early history of fur appa rel, its use was determined by climate ; to-day, and especially in this country, it is regulated by the caprice of fashion . The mink for many years took the lead in the list of fashionable furs, but has of late been superseded by the introduction of the fur s eal.

The fur of the Beaver was fo rmerly highly prized in th e manufacture of hats. and yielded a large porti on of the profits of the Fur Companies, constituting the largest item in value among furs. Cheaper materials have since been substituted in making hats, and the demand for this purpose has been gr eatly reduced. By a new process the skin is now prepared as a handsome fur for collars and gauntlets, and its fine silky wool has b een successfully woven. The soft, white fur from the belly of th e animal, is largely used in France for bonnets. Raccoon skins are the great staple for Russia and Germany, where, on account of their durability and cheapness, they ar e in demand for linings for coats, etc. Among the Bear skins, those of the black and grizzly are extensively used for military caps, housings, holst ers, sleigh robes, etc, The fur of the Lynx is soft, warm a nd light, and is commonly dyed of a beautiful shining black. It is used for the facings and linings of cloaks, chiefly in America. The Fisher yields a dark and full fur which is larg ely used in fashionable winter apparel. The skin of the Marten, is richly dy ed and utilized in choice furs and trimmings. The Mink, like the two foregoing, belongs to the same genus as the Russian Sable, and its fur so much resembles the latter as to be sometimes mistaken for it.

The Muskrat produces the fur most wo rn by the masses, and is largely exported into Germany, Fran ce and England. It is estimated that over six millions of muskrat skins are annually taken in Amer ica, and of that number one-half are used in Germany alone. The skin of the Otter is at present cl assed among the leadi ng fashionable furs in this country. They are dyed of a deep purplish bl ack color, and are made into sacques, muffs, etc. It is also used by the Russians, Greeks and Chinese. It is mostly an American product, but is also procured to so me extent in the British Isles from a smaller vari ety of the species. The skins of the Wolf are chiefly used for sleigh robes and such purposes. The fur of the Rabbit is mainly employed in the manufacture of felt, and is also utilized for lining and trim ming.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS. The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit http://pglaf.org While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support. Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition. Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility: http://www.gutenberg.net This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
