This book contains proven strategies on how to start a fire from the materials around you, even in forests that are soaked from weeks of rain. You’ll learn about the three things any fire needs, and how to provide them as ef ficiently as possible. Then you’ll delve into what makes a good fuel, and how to find it in the forest, as well as a few fire lays and how to pick which one will work the best for the fuel and wind. Finally, we’ll cover starting the fire, first with modern methods, and later by banging rocks and rubbing sticks. Each fire lay, type of tinder, and fire-starting method is explained, in detail, with pointers on how to be the most efficient with your actions, and tips on how to ensure success. Thanks again for downloading this book, I hope you enjoy it!"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"THE FIRE STOOL Fire requires three things to burn, this is often referred to as the “fire triangle”, but makes more sense in my mechanical brain as a three-legged fire stoo l. Pull any of the three legs, and the results will be less than incendiary . The first leg, which is most often overlooked, is oxygen. Fire is the chemical reaction of oxy gen with fuel, using up the oxygen in the process. Providing oxygen is easy enough, as it makes up about 21% of the atmosphere, but the fire will quickly burn through the supply if not allowed a constant inflow of fresh air. When laying out a fire, it is important to plan how oxy gen will get to what must be burned in the initial stages of the fire. A dense ly pack ed pile of perfe ctly dry twigs will not burn well, whereas spreading them a bit and stacki ng them so as to allow air flow will have much better results. The next leg is fuel, or something to burn. This can be paper , wood, plastic, or even metals if the fire gets hot enough. The mos t important qualities of the fuel are dryness and size. Wood, leaves, and litter that are soaked with water are very difficult to light, as a tremendous amount of ener gy that could ordinarily be used to ignite the fuel must be wasted boiling the water and forcing out the steam before the fuel can take light. Smaller pieces of fuel can be lit more easily , so starting with things that are light and fluf fy, like dry pine needles and leaves, can give a larger flame to light twigs, bran ches, and finally logs. Dry is emphasized because barring"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"extremely arid climates, leaf litter on the forest floor is nearly always wet, or at least damp enough to make it steam instead of catch fire. The final leg is heat energy, usually from an existing flame or spark. Wood or other fuels are a lot like a battery with a bouncer. For years, sunlight hits trees, and most of the energy is used to maintain the life of the tree, while a little is stored away in the form of wood growth. Once the tree is cut down, that heat and light is still accessible, but there’s an access fee. The cover charge for this show is that some amount of energy must be provided to the fuel upfront to get the party going. Once this energy has been invested, enough that the fuel continues to burn without external input, the excess heat can be used to dry and light other pieces of fuel. Larger pieces need more energy upfront, while smaller pieces like twigs and grasses hardly need any coaxing to start up. Start with very small pieces of fuel and a match or lighter for an easy start and transition up the fire food- chain to twigs, small sticks, and progressively larger pieces up to logs and larger as necessary."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Finding Fuel As fire is a reaction of oxygen to release energy in the form of heat and light, the list of potential fuels is almost endless. However , just because something can be burned does not mean it is wise to do so. Plastics (among other things) often emit noxious fumes when burned. The best fuel for a campfire consists of dry, seasoned wood, with perhaps some twigs and paper to get it started. Wood was described by Aldo Leopold as a sort of natural battery: the tree stores away little bits of the energy it takes in from the sun over its lifetime, and burning it releases the heat and light again. It turns out that, given an excess of nutrients and water, trees of most species store away about the same weight of wood each year. This explains why the wood of fast-growing trees like poplar or birch tends to be much lighter, or less dense, than wood of a slower grower , like a red oak. Recently alive wood, or gr een wood , has a very high moisture content. Combustion of a piece of wood requires that the majority of the water stored within that piece first be boiled off before it will sustain a flame on its own, so reducing the moisture content before trying to light firewood is essential. This is not to say that it’s not possible to burn green wood, just that it’s much more difficult to do so. Denser woods take longer to dry out than lighter woods, as there is less air space for the water to migrate out through the pores of the wood. The moisture can either be allowed to migrate out on its own, or the wood can be dried in a large kiln. Either way, exposing more surface area to the air will help the wood to come to equilibrium with the moisture content of the surrounding air. Splitting firewood is the normal means of increasing surface area, and stacking it"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"well to allow air to circulate through the stack speeds drying. Even split and stacked, air-drying dense oaks can take more than a year in northern climates. Not every fire can be planned years in advance, which brings about the importance of finding wood already dry enough to burn. The forest floor is wet. Even when it seems dry, the dense mat of litter that accumulates in most forests is a teeming mass of decay, churned by earthworms, and it holds moisture very well. Anything in contact with it will be much wetter than a few feet off the ground. Looking up is the best way to find dry wood when it is needed for a fire in the near-term. Often branches break off of trees and fall, only to get hung up on lower branches and never make it to the ground. Another option is dead branches still attached to the tree. Dense stands of pines and other trees will block out much of the light from the forest floor, rendering the lower branches worthless. In white pines and spruces especially , the lower branches die off, but continu e to hang on the tree, dry and ready to serve as kindling. When larger fuel is needed, look for whole dead trees still standing with bark intact. Even if the upper portions are rotted, the lower are probably still solid enough to be used as some of the major logs for a fire, at least for long enough to dry out some greener logs. As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter , wood is like a battery, but this battery cannot simply be plugged in. Accessing the energy in wood requires an energy investment, known to chemists as activation ener gy . Think of it as pushing a wagon up the last few feet to a mountai ntop to let it coast all the way down the other side. The amount of energy needed to activate the stored energy depends on how much water must be driven out, and how large and dense the piece of wood is. Anyone who has ever tried"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"holding a match to a log has quickly learned the futility of such an exercise. Put in the more familiar terms of food, you wouldn’ t feed steak to a baby. The tiny flame living on the match tip is a baby, and the log a steak. Before it can devour the steak, it’ll need some transitional food. Start with baby food, or tinder . Tinder is light, fluffy, and dry. This ensures maximum airflow to the sensitive young flame and gets it ready for the kindling. Kindling is made up of anything smaller than a pinky finger in diameter , and can be wood shavings, tiny splits of dry firewood, or twigs and sticks gathered from the forest. Finally, after burning through enough kindling, the fire has built up enough heat for sticks about thumb size, and then for wrist-thick and larger pieces. Another way to picture the fire is like a chain of dominoes, where the tiny starting one cannot hope to knock over a three-story tall monster domino, but with enough intermediates of increasing size, it can. The wetter the fuel, the more tinder, kindling, and small fuel will be required to provide the activation ener gy for it to catch. In the event that plentiful larger fuel is available, but tinder and kindling are scarce, the larger fuel can be reduced down to tinder and kindling by shaving or splitting , or a more advanced strategy known as a feather stick may be employed. Splitting down large pieces of wood is a great way to find dry fuel in an area that has seen a lot of rain for a few weeks, as the larger pieces take much longer to saturate, and the core will stay dry much longer than other small fuel sources."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"A hatchet is ideally suited for splitting down logs, but a heavy, fixed- blade knife with a full tang (metal extending all the way through the handle) can be beaten through a short log, using a smaller log as a mallet. This method is called batoning. Hatchets and batoning both work best on logs about forearm length, stood on a stump or other sturdy base."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Absent a stump, another techniq ue can be used on logs up to about four inches in diameter and about as long as your hatchet. Holding the log to be split near one end with the left hand and gripping the hatchet with the right (reverse if left-handed), set the blade of the hatchet against the side of the far end of the log, and hold the hatchet handle parallel to the log. Moving both log and hatchet together , firmly strike the side of the far end of the log against a tree trunk or other solid object, letting the inertia of the hatchet head carry it into the log, and taking care to avoid pinching fingers of the hatchet hand between the handle and log. Repeat until a good split is started, and the head is firmly buried in the log, then twist the log and hatchet ninety degrees, which should split the log the rest of the way down."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"A feather stick is a sort of self-contained tinder and kindling all in one, consisting of a main stick with many curlicue shavings cut from it, but still attached at one end, taking on the appearance of a feather. The production of a feather stick requires some skill and a very sharp knife. It is made much easier by using a favorable piece of wood with a medium density and straight grain (not oak, too brittle!), which can be difficult to judge at the outset, so grab a piece and give it a try, but don’t be afraid to switch to a different stick if the first one proves dif ficult. Start of f by prepping a smooth (not flat) surface to work from, either by stripping bark, or smoothing out the rough surface of a split piece of wood. Take care to maintain that smooth surface by always running any cut you make all the way down to the bottom, even if the curl falls off, as stopping short several times will leave ridges and divots that make maintaining shaving thicknes s impossible. Pick a point or ridge running along the stick,"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"grip the knife with a firm hammer grip, and set one end of the stick on the ground to brace, holding the top end with your other hand. Lay the flat of your knife against the workpiece a few inches down from the top, and slice across and downwards, slowly increasing pressure and rolling the knife edge into the workpiece until it starts to cut a very fine shaving. The goal is to keep these shavings as thin as you can, without accidentally cutting them free of the stick. Put your weight to work by holding your arm straight and leaning down on knife, freeing up the muscles of your arm and hand for fine motor control, and enabling you to keep at it longer. Always run any curl all the way down, no matter how early it breaks of f. The most common mistake in trying to produce a good curl is to push the knife through the wood, rather than slicing. Pushing straight through the wood requires far too much power for the finesse required to maintain a thin shaving and stop the cut without knocking the curl off the stick. Slicing across the working face of the stick allows much more control. It is best to jump around on the working surface of the stick, constan tly working off a sharp corner of the area, and curling off very narrow shavings. Experiment a little, and you’ll find that by pointing the knife tip down more, you cut shavings that curl one way, and by raising it, they’ll curl the other. Switching back and forth can help fill in one side or the other of the feather. Once the stick is completed, it can be lit off of a match (or sparks, if extremely fine shavings are cut), and will continue to burn the small curls until the main stick catches fire. They are best burned with the curlicues hanging down off the stick, rather than protruding up off the top, and"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"several feathersticks can be used together to generate more heat than just one. The eagle’s nest fire lay can be of great help in drying wood for the fire without smother ing a small flame too much. While heat generally rises, or more correctly , hot air rises, fire also radiates heat outward in all directions, which is why it feels warm to sit next to a fire, even when not above it. This radiant “waste” heat can be put to work drying wet wood by simply piling it around the fire, making sure it is far enough away from the blaze to not actually catch fire. Even then, watch it carefully or a much larger fire than intended may be the result. This lay is most effective in drying thumb- sized sticks, though it can certainly be used in a modified fashion to set heavier logs just outside the actual fire, much closer than in a normal eagle’s nest, to drive moisture from large logs without overtax ing a small fire."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"FIRE LA YS Fire Safety Even more important than getting a fire lit and keeping it going is keeping it under control. Never start a fire you don’t have the means to control, and always keep enough water, dirt, or snow ready to put out a blaze twice the size you intend to build. Even in the direst survival situation, starting a forest fire will not improve your odds of survival. Choosing a location for a fire is very similar to choosing a campsite, in that you must look up as well as down. In general, take advantage of shallow depress ions in the earth to help contain the fire. Avoid steep slopes, unless you want to accidentally slide into the pit, or have burning logs roll down on you. Always clear leaves and other forest litter away from the fire for at least five feet in every direction. They may start off damp and hard to ignite, but as the fire burns, the leaves on the ground will dry enough to let the fire spread uncontrollably . Look up as well. Firewood found in the woods is wet, even the dead standing wood, and pops much more than the drier stuff found at campsites. The popping can toss sparks and embers high into the air, or several feet away from the pit, where they can light low-hangi ng branches or leaf litter . "},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Do what you can to create solid barriers around the fire. A ring of rocks, or a hole dug down into the ground are best, but very large wet logs can be used to make walls for a pit as well. The more contained, the easier it is to keep the fire controlled, and if it’s set down into the ground (or snow), putting the fire out with a pile of snow or dirt is much easy, so long as you have that pile ready to go when needed. Putting a fire out is best accomp lished by attacking all three legs of the fire stool: remove the air from the fuel, and the fuel from the heat. Spread out the embers and hot fuel and cover them with dirt or douse them in water. Better yet, do both. Always put out any fire you have to leave unattended, as the wind can easily shift or pick up and whip a small fire into a massive forest-devouring inferno. Better to be safe whenever dealing with forces that can easily escape our control, and fire is one of the most dangerous. Do yourself and all outdoor enthusiasts a favor, protect the forest from fires. General Fire Preparation The key to laying out a fire is understanding which direction it will burn. In the absence of wind, fire burns upwards most readily, because heat rises, and that convection strips the moisture out of the fuel above, carrying it out and away from the fire, and enabling a rapid upward spread. In a strong wind, young flames need to be sheltered, while more robust infernos can draw power from the rapid influx of air. Planning for all of these things, as well as the need for oxygen to get to the heart of the fire, can"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"make the choice of fire lay easy, even if no formally named layout is used. The last thing to plan for is size and wetness of wood. Try to take advantage of early heat to dry out large and wet pieces without over-taxing the fledgling fire. Laying a few large pieces in at the start can help ensure the ener gy of the early flame is transferred to a longer -lived fire. Also, to keep the youngest, most sensitive flames from getting steamed out, it’s best to construct a “stage”, a platform of sorts to keep the tinder and kindling up of f the potentially wet ground. Teepee"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Teepee style is perhaps the most classic campfire architecture, consisting of some bundled small tinder at the center, surrounded by ever- increasing sizes of sticks leaned in on one-another . A classic mistake in laying out one of these fires is forgetting to leave an access hole to the innards, where the fire must be lit. Starting with a tripod of large, roughly equal-size logs and filling in can ensure the inclusion of the large logs isn’t forgotten, and results in an airier interior structure, which burns better. The teepee is the best way to cope with very different log sizes, or oddly-shaped logs, but take care to ensure the pile remains balanced, or it will topple over . Log Cabin"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"The Log Cabin fire lay looks just like a set of Linkin-Logs, without all the notches. Start with a stage, or flat platform of sticks and logs, laid good and level atop the ground or ashes of an old fire. Use small twigs and stones to help stabilize any troublesome sticks in the stage. The tinder is placed in the middle, and two pieces of larger kindling are placed parallel to each other, one on either side of the tinder pile. Moving up a level, two more pieces are set crosswise perpendicular to the first two rails, also parallel to each other and on opposites sides of the tinder pile. Proceed upward s in this fashion , the taller the better for getting the fire going quickly, but keep stability in mind. Add logs to the outside, forming another square ring about the inner chimney . Slot some small kindling into the internal structure a few inches above the tinder pile, light the tinder, and take a step back. This is one of the most sure-fire “one match” fires out there, so long as enough tinder and kindling are used to dry and heat the"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"main fuel. A variation on the Log Cabin, sometimes called the Combination Fire, can be created by starting with a small teepee fire lay, and ringing it with a log cabin of main fuel. The teepee is more ef ficient for starting a small fire, and the cabin takes over in the mid to mature stages of the burn. Wind Wedge A Wind Wedge is designed to shelter a fire in the early stages and take advantage of the wind later on. Starting with a stage as usual, find the direction of the prevailing wind, and lay two of the largest pieces of fuel at ninety degrees to each other, forming an arrow pointing towards where the wind is blowing from. This should create a small hollow in which a large bundle of tinder can be nestled. If necessary , add a few more large logs to create a good solid shield for the tinder, then lean kindling up over the tinder onto the main wedge logs, with smaller pieces directly atop the"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"tinder, and larger above. Once established, the fire can be maintained in wedge-formation for a very hot burn, or slowly morphed into a cabin or teepee form for more traditional enjoyment. Dakota Fire Hole Another way to take advantage of the wind, or to hide from view, is the Dakota Fire Hole. The Dakota Fire Hole burns hot and with very little smoke. Featured in survival manuals and prepper discussions, this fire lay consists of a main pit and a ventilation tunnel. In a stable soil, dig a hole of appropriate size for the fire, about one-and-a-half times deeper than it is wide. Then dig a smaller , secondary tunnel down at a forty-five-degree angle to intersect the bottom of the main pit, about half the diameter of the main pit, located upwind. The fire is lit in the bottom of the main hole, and may require some blowing of air down the vent tube to get started, but once heat starts rising off the fire, the resulting vacuum will suck fresh air in through the vent all on its own. These fires burn very hot and clean, and are easy to cook over, as a simple grate can be constructed by laying green sticks (green to prevent burning) over the top of the main pit in a lattice pattern. The flames should stay down in the hole, and the minimal smoke keeps food tasting clean. The limited smoke and hidden flames help this fire go unnotice d, making it very popular in military and prepper circles. Eagle’s Nest"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"An Eagle’s Nest is not so much a fire lay as a preparatory measure. An eagle’s nest looks much like a smaller bird’s twig nest, but on a truly massive scale. The goal here is to shoot for something in between: stack a ring of wet sticks and branches around the fire, far enough off to not steam the fire to death, but close enough to dry out. This way, when a new stick is needed to feed the fire, a preheated and pre-dried piece can be pulled from the throng and tossed straight in. It can be used to ring any of the first three fire lays, but would not be very effective when used around the Dakota Fire Hole, as the heat doesn’ t radiate out laterally from that lay ."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"MODERN FIRE-ST ARTING METHODS Whether you’re an experienced woodsman trying out a new fire lay, or a beginner just getting the hang of things for your first camping trip, it’s easiest to start off using the most modern methods available: lighters, matches, and ferrocerium rods. Coincidentally , that listing is both the ease of use and the order of development. Many people mistakenly believe matches to be less technologica lly advanced than lighters. At its core, a lighter is a gas tank shooting out a regulated flow of flammable gas, with a sparking device affixed to it for convenience, whereas a match depends on the chemical reaction of white and red phosphorous, as facilitated by friction, to ignite. Not only did scientists have to discover this reaction, but also figure out how to safely manufacture the matches. Lighters Lighters are superior to matches in many respects: they require less skill to start a flame, burn longer and in a more consistent manner , and are often equipped with child-safety mechanisms which help prevent accidents. The gas station butane cigarette lighter is easy to use: just grip the plastic tank in one hand, metal end up, place a thumb on the flint striker wheel, with the button towards your body. Next, press down fast and hard on that wheel, letting the thumb roll back off the top onto the gas button, so that in"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"the same motion you toss sparks into the air, and open the gas valve. Keep the button held down as long as you wish to keep the flame going, and let go when you want it to go out. If it didn’t light the first time, try a few more times. You can shake a lighter and listen for sloshing liquid to check if it’s out of fuel. Even when a lighter runs out of fuel, it’s still useful. The flint wheel and spring still throw sparks that can be used to start a fire using the more primitive fire-starting methods outlined in the next chapter . Important things to note are that most cheap lighters aren’t built to sustain a flame for more than about thirty seconds. Parts of the plastic could start to melt, eventually triggering an explosion, so don’t hold that button down all day. Also, butane lighters are sensitive to temperatu re, altitude, and wind, so they’re not an ideal choice for mountaineering. As long as those limitations are kept in mind, those thirty seconds of consistent flame, especially on a stick lighter, are great for those more uncertain about getting their fire going. Matches Matches are a little trickier to use, but in some conditions, they may be more suitable. Usually they come with wood or cardboard bodies and are either “strike anywhere” or “strike on box” / “safety” matches. The strike anywhere variety have both red and white phosphorous on their tips and can be struck on most rough surfaces. Safety matches only have half the chemical reaction on the match head, with the other component in a dedicated strike strip mounted on the box or match book. When packing matches for a trip, if you’re taking less than a full book / box, absolutely do not forget to bring at least part of the strike strip along, or those matches are"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"next to worthle ss. Unlike lighters, matches need to be kept dry (unless specifically waterproofed, more on this later), they burn for a shorter time, and don’ t offer a consistent/steady flame. A match has an initial flare of aggressive burn brought on by the chemical reaction, but this quickly dies off, so the match should be held head-down (careful to avoid burning fingers!) for the initial burst to ensure that the flame can transfer properly to the stick of the match. Then the stick burns with a smaller , more subdued flame until it is either blown out by the user, blown out by the wind, or reaches the end of the stick and goes out. The subdued flame is extreme ly easy for the wind to put out, but it is usually what gets the tinder burning and starts the fire. With quick fingers, you can strike a match and get it in position beneath a bundle of tinder in one smooth motion, but take care to avoid holding the match too close to the tinder and smothering it before the flame can take hold on the stick. To waterproof a match, just melt some wax and dip the match quickly in it. The crucial thing is to keep the phosphorus dry, so even a quick dunk in the puddle of a candle could suffice for protecting the head. Matches are preferable in situations with high altitude, extreme temperatures, and when the fire-lighting device needs to be kept for a long time in harsh conditions. A lighter left in a car could easily explode or leak, whereas matches, so long as they’re kept dry , tend to stay good nearly indefinitely . Ferrocerium Rods Ferrocerium rods are a modern spin on flint and steel and serve as a good introducti on to coaxing sparks into fire. Ferrocerium rods are"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"composed of a mixture of metals specifically formulated to throw aggressive sparks when stroked with a hard-angled piece of metal, such as a bit of hack-saw blade, or the spine of some knives. They’re much easier to use than traditional flint and steel, and not as hard on a knife. Lighters and matches both produce flames directly , while the rod only throws sparks, and will need to be used somewhat dif ferently . Instead of holding an open flame under some sort of tinder, the user must shower an especially light and fluffy tinder with sparks until one catches and either bursts directly into an open flame or starts a slow burning ember or coal. This will depend on the sort of tinder being used. If a coal is struck, it will need to be wrapped in tinder and blown into flame. Make a bird’s nest shape out fluffy tinder, like dry grasses or thin wood shavings, and set the coal in the middle. Gently collapse the nest around the coal, cradling it, not smothering it. Now to provide oxygen, blow gently on into the nest, heating up the coal. Listen to the sounds and watch the coal glow as you increase the air flow. When it starts to smoke, you can transition to waving the tinder bundle through the air to get your lungs a break, and watch for the first flames to appear. Once the tinder bundle lights up, quickly put it into the already-prepared fire lay. The bundle will be engulfed in flames very quickly from this point, so take care not to get burned. As soon as the flames are well-established, the fire can be built up as normal. Ferrocerium rods do not go bad, they work when wet, and are not subject to deteriorating in harsh climatic conditions like the other two methods. It’s easy to find small rods and toss them in a tackle box, on a keychain, or in a backpack, and have them around as a backup should all"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"else fail. They are also a fantastic challenge, showpiece, and a great way to practice using sparks to make fire, without all the trouble of using flint and steel."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"PRIMITIVE FIRE-ST ARTING METHODS Tinder is much more important in primitive methods than in modern methods. Many primitive methods require more steps to transition from the initial ignition to a self-sustaini ng fire, forcing more reliance on the initial fuel. While some ignition source / tinder combinations will deliver flames like a butane lighter, many will only produce small, glowing coals which need to be supported and sustained until they can be worked into flames. Types of T inder In North American boreal forests, small bits of bark off paper birch trees can be stripped away without damaging them, and fatwood can be collected from rotting downed evergreen trees. Fatwood is evergreen wood super-impregnated with resinous sap. It is often found at the shoulder of a tree where limbs meet the trunk, or in the center of rotting stumps. Both birch bark and fat wood are very flammable, and if powdered thin by peeling or rubbing with a knife blade, can ignite directly from repeated showers of sparks. Other tinder sources generate small glowing coals, which must be transferred to a “bird’s nest” of dry grass, bark, or wood shavings, and blown into flame. Some natural examples in a boreal forest are dry cattail"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"fluff and amadou, the fluffy inner skin of the horseshoe fungus or “tinder fungus” ( fomes fomentarius ). The coal generated by friction fire methods will behave the same way. These coals are very fragile and must be handled with extreme care to avoid putting them out, especially when hard- won through friction methods. With a little forethought, char cloth and other similar materials can be prepared. Char cloth is created by heating cotton or other types of natural fiber in the absence of oxygen, burning off some of the Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), which leaves behind mostly purified carbon. Char cloth, like charcoal, lights easier than the original material, and burns hot. An easy way to make char cloth is by loading a metal tin with cloth, poking a hole in the lid, and setting the tin on the edge of a fire. When the VOCs start to leave the cloth, a small candle-like fire will ignite above the hole, and burn until the VOCs are gone, at which point the tin can be retrieved and allowed to cool. It smolders as a coal when first lit but can be easily blown into flame without need of a nest. Other materials, such as amadou or cattail fluf f, can be treated similarly to create other charred tinders. Fire by Friction Friction fires demand the most planning of any fire-starting method, absolutely dry materials, and the right combination of hardness and resin content of the plough/drill and hearth board. The coals generated are very fragile and need to be transferr ed cautiously to a bird’s nest, blown into flame, and transferred into a ready-built fire lay. Creating easily combustible sawdust that can be ignited by the low-grade heat of manual friction relies heavily on the dryness of the base materials. Some wetness"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"can be overcom e with exceptional vigor in using the techniqu es listed in this chapter , but not much. The goal is to rub sticks together , generating heat and sawdust, until the sawdust starts to smolder and condenses down on itself to form a tight coal. The hardness of the wood pieces and resin content influence the quality of sawdust for coal formation, and the right combination of wood species can take some experimentatio n to find. Various sources making conflicting claims on which should be the harder piece of wood. Two pieces of wood are required for a fire plough: the plough and the hearth board. The plough is a hard, dry stick, about thumb-th ick and the length of a forearm, held with one or both hands. The hearth board sits on the ground and can be held in place by a foot, or the hands of a partner . The plough is rubbed back and forth, carving a trench in the hearth board, creating sawdust and heat from the friction. The trench can be started by carving out a channel, using a blade or rock, but this isn’t strictly necessary . Ideally, the bottom of the hearth board is flat, to prevent wobbling around, but a rounded log can be chocked in place with rocks, other sticks, or a channel dug into the ground. Another forearm length log, this one about twice wrist thickness, with the top and bottom third split off is a great candidate for this board. Again, dryness of the materials is essential. Given enough time, the correct amount of pressure, and a bit of skill, it’s possible to coax a coal out of the sawdust, transfer it to a bird’s nest, and blow it into flames. The other major class of fire by friction is the drills group, which are all variations on the hand drill, the simplest form. A hand drill set consists of a spindle and hearth board, this hearth board can be much smaller than"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"the one used in a fire plough. The most important dimension for a hearth board is thickness, as a notch needs to be cut or carved into the edge of the board to funnel the dust into a coal. Instead of rubbing a stick back and forth, the drill uses friction from the spindle rotating in a hole, much like a power drill, to produce the coal. The hand drill spindle should be a hard, dry, very straight stick, about the length of an arm. The bottom of the spindle should be about the diameter of a penny, slightly thinner at the top. The spindle needs a rounded point on it. The hearth board, should be half an inch thick and needs a hole started with the tip of a knife, centered about the thickness of the spindle away from the edge. The tip of the spindle is then set into the beginning of the hole, with both hands on either side of the spindle, in a prayer pose at the top end. With a firm, downward pressure, rotate the spindle back and forth between your hands, allowing them to progress down its length to a few inches above the hearth board. Reset your hands at the top, and repeat the action, over and over, until a good hole is formed. At this point, darkened sawdust should be visible rimming the hole on all sides. To collect and concentrate the rest of the dust, a notch needs to be cut into the hearth board. Starting at the edge of the board, make two cuts towards just shy of the center of the hole, spaced about half an inch apart on the board edge side. Set the resulting v-shaped notch over something to catch the coal, like a dry chip of bark or thin split of wood, and ensure the bird’s nest and fire lay are ready. The spindle must then be set back in the hole, and spun vigorously , but with endurance in mind, as even with good materials and the right shapes, this process will take several minutes. Eventually good dark sawdust should start to collect into a coal, and a thin wisp of smoke will trail out after several more minutes of work. The first wisps will not indicate a robust"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"coal; the drilling must be continued for several more minutes to consolidate the coal and ensure success. A bow drill uses the same idea of a spinning stick, but the higher technology allows for inferior quality woods to be used with success. A bow drill set consists of four pieces: a hearth board; a shorter, thicker spindle; a top block; and a small bow. The hearth board is the same as that used in the hand drill, and the spindle is similar, but only about forearm length and thicker, at about the diameter of a nickel. The top block can be anything low friction, from a smooth piece of wood or rock, to a knife handle with a hole in it. This is held in the non-dominant hand, braced against the knee of the foot holding down the hearth board, and is used to provide and control the downwa rd pressure on the spindle. The “bow” is a springy stick about arm length or shorter, with some sort of robust cordage to serve as a string. The spindle is twisted into the string of the bow, taking care to ensure it does not end up between the string and the bow stick, but rather on the outside of the string to avoid pinching and throwing the spindle . Once the spindle is looped in and seated into both the spindle and top block, the bow is moved forward and back in a sawing motion, taking care to balance the spinning and downward pressure. The usual technique to manage all the pieces of a bow drill is to (from a crouch with the knee of your dominant hand side on the ground behind you) hold the hearth board down with your foot on your non-dominant-han d side, with the top block gripped in your non-dominant-hand, pressing down and braced against the knee. The dominant-hand side knee is set on the ground behind, and the dominant hand holds the bow ."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" Once the hearth board hole and notch are primed and ready, the user saws away vigorously on the bow, taking care to balance the downward pressure with the non-dominant hand. With proper materials and technique, a good coal can be generated in under a minute, but lower quality material or imperfect technique may require several minutes of work before a coal is generated. Fire by Spark With the right tinder and some source of sparks, a fire can be made with much less energy expenditure than by friction. Spark sources in the modern day can be a battery and steel wool or a foil gun wrapper , a ferrocerium rod, or striking various metals against each other, but in the back country , sparks have to come from less obvious sources. Flint and steel were the tools of choice for European explorers, but flint is not always readily available. Fortunately , any object harder than steel can be used to create sparks by striking it against steel. The sparks are just tiny flakes of steel, shaved off by the impact, and superheated by friction and rapid oxidation as they fly. Chert, obsidian, quartz, flint, and even glass are some of the most common, but for the non-geologist, trial and error works fantastically to find a hard, spark-producing rock. On the topic of spark-producing steels, many modern stainles s steels are far more difficult, if not impossible, to create sparks from, and many knives and other outdoor supplies are now made from stainless steel. When stuck without good carbon steel to spark, trial and error of smashing rocks against each other can still sometimes produce serendipitous sparks,"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"perhaps from iron-bearing ores. The best spark-catching tinders for starting fire in this way are char cloth, and dryer lint from a good load of new cotton towels. In the absence of those tinders, finely shaven or powdered birch bark or tinder fungus will do. When using a purpose-built steel striker from a flint and steel kit, the tinder is set on top of the flint fragment, which is held with a very sharp, chipped edge pointed outward toward the other hand. The second hand, holding the steel, strikes downward along the edge of the stone, tossing shaved-of f sparks onto the tinder, hopefully starting a smolder . The spine of a knife can be carefully used in place of the steel striker, but when using more improvised spark sources, tinder placement will need to be carefully considered to avoid injury while maximizing likelihood of catching the spark. Fire by Refraction The sun provides plenty of energy to start a fire as well, you need only focus it. Any clear object that’s convex (bowed out) on both surfaces can be used to focus the sun’s light and heat from a large area into a smaller area, raising the temperature. Some children use magnifying glasses to focus the sun and burn ants, but a better use of this power is starting fires. Fire by refractio n was my favorite show-of f method as a kid at camp, especially because the counselors usually doubted it would work. With a large enough lens, even low-quality tinder can take light, but with most small magnifying glasses or other lenses, very dry paper works best. To practice, use dry paper and a very lar ge magnifying glass."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" Pick a sunny day (it can work with clouds, but is much easier without), a large glass, and some balled-up newspaper . Head to an area with open sky and put the sun behind your back. Set the newspaper on the ground and hold it down so it doesn’t blow away and bring the magnifying glass up as if looking through it at the paper . The glass needs to be lined up with the sun shining straight on it to work most effectively , imagine the surface of the glass is the mouth of a long tube you’re trying to shoot the sun’s light straight down onto the paper, and you’ll be pretty close. Then start moving the glass towards and away from the paper, watching the circle of light expand and contract on the paper. Be careful, it can burn you when focused correctly , and the very bright light can hurt your eyes if you stare at it too long. The trick is to blow gently on the newspaper . Try to keep the circle of light as small as possible on the paper. If the paper doesn’t immediately burst into flames, try tilting the glass a bit in each direction, and moving refocusing it on the page. Sometimes it’s easiest to see that the lens isn’t tilted properly by purposely un-focusing the circle of light until it’s about dime-sized and looking to see if it’s perfectly round. Any tilt to the alignment will cause the circle to get squished into an oval, and that small misalignment will make lighting the paper much harder . When the paper chars away in one spot, chase an edge of the hole with the light, and keep gently blowing on it. The heat is there, you just need enough oxygen. It can take some effort to get it the first few times, but the satisfaction is quite worth it."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" The very large magnifying glass just makes it easier, in the right conditions, I’ve used lenses about the size of a dime. Other objects can be used as well, including water bottles, ice chunks, or glasses of far-sighted people (most people with glasses are near-sighted). Anything clear and convex will work.
