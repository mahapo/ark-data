PURPOSE Today’s Marines operate within a continuum of force where conflict may change from low intensity to high intensity over a matter of hours. Marines are also engaged in many military operations other than war, such as peacekeeping missions or noncom- batant evacuation operations, where deadly force may not be authorized. During non- combative engagements, Marines must determine if a situation warrants applying deadly force. Sometimes Marines must decide in a matter of seconds because their lives or the lives of others depend on their actions. To make the right decision, Marines must understand both the lethal and nonlethal close combat techniques need- ed to handle the situation responsibly without escalating the violence unnecessarily. Marine Corps Reference Publication (MCRP) 3-02B, Close Combat , provides the tac- tics, techniques, and procedures of Marine Corps close combat. It also provides the doctrinal basis for the Marine Corps Close Combat Training Program (MCCCTP). 2. SCOPE This publication guides individual Marines, unit leaders, and close combat instructors in the proper tactics, techniques, and procedures for close combat. MCRP 3-02B is not intended to replace supervision by appropriate unit leaders and close combat in- struction by qualified instructors. Its role is to ensure standardization and execution of tactics, techniques, and procedures throughout the Marine Corps. 3. SUPERSESSION MCRP 3-02B supersedes Fleet Marine Force Manual (FMFM) 0-7, Close Combat , dated 9 July 1993. There are significant differences between the two publications. MCRP 3-02B should be reviewed in its entirety."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"4. WARNING Techniques described in this publication can cause serious injury or death.

Purpose of Close Combat Close combat is the physical confrontation be- tween two or more opponents. It involves armed and unarmed and lethal and nonlethal fighting techniques that range from enforced compliance to deadly force. The purpose of close combat is to execute armed and unarmed techniques to pro- duce both lethal and nonlethal results. Unarmed techniques include hand-to-hand combat and de- fense against hand-held weapons. Armed tech- niques include techniques applied with a rifle, bayonet, knife, baton, or any weapon of opportu- nity. 2. Continuum of Force Marines will find themselves in both combative and noncombative situations. The threat level in these situations can rise and fall several times based on the actions of both Marines and the peo- ple involved. The escalation of force stops when one person complies with the demands imposed by another person. This range of actions is known as a continuum of force. Continuum of force is the concept that there is a wide range of possible ac- tions, ranging from voice commands to applica- tion of deadly force, that may be used to gain and maintain control of a potentially dangerous situa- tion (MCO 5500.6_, Arming of Security and Law Enforcement [LE] Personnel and the Use of Force ). Continuum of force consists of five levels that correspond to the behavior of the people in- volved and the actions Marines use to handle the situation (see the table below). Close combat techniques are executed in levels three, four, and five. Level One: Compliant (Cooperative) The subject complies with verbal commands. Close combat techniques do not apply. Level Two: Resistant (Passive) The subject resists verbal commands but complies immediately to any contact controls. Close com- bat techniques do not apply. . Continuum of Force Level Description Actions 1 Compliant (Cooperative) Verbal commands 2 Resistant (Passive) Contact controls 3 Resistant (Active) Compliance techniques 4 Assaultive (Bodily Harm) Defensive tactics 5 Assaultive (Serious Bodily Harm/ Death) Deadly force Note: Shading indicates levels in which Marines use close combat techniques."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"vi _________________________________________________________________________________________________ MCRP 3-02B Level Three: Resistant (Active) The subject initially demonstrates physical resis- tance. Marines use compliance techniques to con- trol the situation. Level three incorporates close combat techniques to physically force a subject to comply. Techniques include— l Come-along holds. l Soft-handed stunning blows. l Pain compliance through joint manipulation and the use of pressure points. Level Four: Assaultive (Bodily Harm) The subject may physically attack Marines, but he does not use a weapon. Marines use defensive tac- tics to neutralize the threat. Defensive tactics in- clude the following close combat techniques: l Blocks. l Strikes. l Kicks. l Enhanced pain compliance procedures. l Nightstick blocks and blows. Level Five: Assaultive (Serious Bodily Harm/Death) The subject usually has a weapon and will either kill or seriously injure someone if he is not stopped immediately and brought under control. Typically, to control the subject, Marines apply deadly force through the use of a firearm, but they may also use armed and unarmed close combat techniques. 3. Marine Corps Tactical Concepts Close combat techniques support the following key Marine Corps tactical concepts. The concepts are not standalone ideas but are to be combined to achieve an effect that is greater than their separate sum. Achieving a Decision Achieving a decision is important in close combat. An indecisive fight wastes energy and possibly Marines’ lives. Whether the intent is to control an opponent through restraint or defend themselves in war, Marines must have a clear pur- pose before engaging in close combat and act de- cisively once engaged. Gaining an Advantage A basic principle of martial arts is to use the op- ponent’s strength and momentum against him to gain more leverage than one’s own muscles alone can generate, thereby gaining an advantage. In close combat, Marines must exploit every advan- tage over an opponent to ensure a successful out- come. This can include employing various weapons and close combat techniques that will present a dilemma to an opponent. Achieving sur- prise can also greatly increase leverage. Marines try to achieve surprise through deception, stealth, and ambiguity. Speed Marines use speed to gain the initiative and ad- vantage over the enemy. In close combat, the speed and violence of the attack against an oppo- nent provides Marines with a distinct advantage. Marines must know and understand the basics of close combat so they can act instinctively with speed to execute close combat techniques. Adapting Close combat can be characterized by friction, un- certainty, disorder, and rapid change. Each situa- tion is a unique combination of shifting factors that cannot be controlled with precision or cer- tainty. For example, a crowd control mission may call for Marines to employ various techniques ranging from nonlethal restraint to more forceful applications. Marines who adapt quickly will have a significant advantage."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Close Combat ______________________________________________________________________________________________ vii Exploiting Success Typically, an enemy will not normally surrender simply because he was placed at a disadvantage. Marines cannot be satisfied with gaining an ad- vantage in a close combat situation. They must exploit any advantage aggressively and ruthlessly until an opportunity arises to completely domi- nate the opponent. Marines must exploit success by using every advantage that can be gained. (reverse blank)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Close Combat Table of Contents Page Overview of Close Combat Chapter 1.

However, all techniques can be executed from either side. The Marine is depicted in camouflage utilities. The opponent is depicted without camouflage. The fundamentals of close combat include ranges, weapons of the body, target areas of the body, and pressure points of the body. These fundamentals form the basis for all close combat techniques. They provide Marines with a common framework regardless of the type of confrontation or the tech- niques used. If Marines apply these fundamentals properly in a close combat situation, they may save their lives or the lives of fellow Marines. 1. Ranges of Close Combat Close combat engagements occur within three ranges: long range, midrange, and close range. During any engagement, these ranges may blur together or may rapidly transition from one to an- other until either the opponent is defeated or the conflict is resolved. Long Range During long range engagements, combatants en- gage each other with rifles, bayonets, sticks, or entrenching tools. See figure below."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"1-2 _______________________________________________________________________________________________ MCRP 3-02B Midrange During midrange engagements, combatants en- gage each other with knives, punches, or kicks. Close Range During close range engagements, combatants grab each other. Close range engagements also in- volve elbow strikes, knee strikes, and grappling. 2. Weapons of the Body Hands and Arms The hands, forearms, and elbows are the arm’s in- dividual weapons. The hands consist of several areas that can be used as weapons: fists, edges of hands, palms, and fingers. Fists. To minimize injury to the fists, Marines use their fists as weapons to target soft tissue areas such as the throat. The fists’ striking surfaces are the first two knuckles of the hands or the meaty portions of the hands be- low the little fingers. Edge of Hand. Marines use the edge of the hand (knife edge) as a weapon. Marines use the edge of the hand to strike soft tis- sue areas. Palms. Because of the palm’s padding, Marines use the heels of the palms to strike, parry, and/or block. Fingers. Marines use the fingers to gouge, rip, and tear soft tissue areas (e.g., eyes, throat, groin). Forearms. Marines use the forearms as a defen- sive tool to deflect or block attacks. Forearms can also be used as striking weapons to damage or break an opponent’s joints and limbs. Marines sustain less self-injury when strikes are conducted"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Close Combat _____________________________________________________________________________________________ 1-3 with the forearms than when strikes are conducted with fists and fingers. Elbows. Marines use the elbows as striking weapons. Because of the short distance needed to generate power, elbows are excellent weapons for striking during the close range of close combat. Legs The legs are more powerful than any other weap- on of the body, and they are less prone to injury when striking. The feet are protected by boots and are the preferred choice for striking. Feet. Marines use the balls of the feet, the insteps, and the toes to kick an opponent. Marines use the cutting edge of the heels and the heels to stomp on an opponent. Marines must be wearing boots when striking with the toes. Knees. Like elbows, knees are excellent weapons in the close range of close combat. Knee strikes are most effective while fighting close to an oppo- nent where kicks are impractical. The opponent’s groin area is an ideal target for the knee strike if he is standing upright. Knee strikes can deliver a devastating secondary attack to an opponent’s face following an initial attack that caused him to bend at the waist. 3. Target Areas of the Body During close combat, Marines strive to attack the accessible target areas of an opponent’s body. The readily accessible areas will vary with each situa- tion and throughout the engagement. The target areas are divided into five major groups: head, neck, torso, groin, and extremities. The figure be- low illustrates target areas of the body. Head The vulnerable regions of the head are the eyes, temple, nose, ears, and jaw. Massive damage to the head kills an opponent. Eyes. The eyes are excellent targets because they are soft tissue areas that are not protected by bone or muscle. Attacks to this area may cause the op- ponent to protect the area with his hands, allowing Marines to execute a secondary attack to other Extremities Extremities Jaw Temple Ears Carotid Sinus Groin Ribs Solar Plexus Eyes Nose Clavicle Cervical Vertebrae Kidneys"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"1-4 _______________________________________________________________________________________________ MCRP 3-02B target areas while the opponent uses his hands to protect his eyes. Temple. The temple is one of the most fragile ar- eas of the head. Powerful strikes to the opponent’s temple cause permanent damage and death. Nose. The nose is very sensitive and easily bro- ken. An attack to this area causes involuntary wa- tering and closing of the opponent’s eyes, rendering him vulnerable to secondary attacks. However, through training, individuals can condi- tion themselves to withstand attacks to the nose. Therefore, any attack to the nose must be power- fully delivered. Ears. Attacks to the ears may cause the eardrum to rupture. But this may not stop or even distract an opponent unless Marines powerfully deliver the strike. Jaw. The jaw region, when struck forcefully, ren- ders the opponent unconscious. Strikes to the jaw cause painful injuries to the teeth and surrounding tissues (e.g., lips, tongue), but the risk of self-inju- ry is great unless Marines deliver strikes with a hard object such as a helmet, rifle butt, or boot heel. Neck The front of the neck, or throat area, is a soft tis- sue area that is not covered by natural protection. Damage to this region causes the opponent’s tra- chea to swell, closing his airway, which can lead to death. Carotid Sinus. The carotid sinus is located on both sides of the neck just below the jaw. Strikes to the carotid sinus restrict blood flow to the brain, causing loss of consciousness or death. Cervical Vertebrae. The cervical vertebrae on the back of the neck, from the base of the skull to the top of the shoulders, contains the spinal cord, which is the nervous system’s link to the brain. The weight of the head and the lack of large mus- cle mass allow damage to the cervical vertebrae and spinal cord. Excessive damage to this area causes pain, paralysis, or death. Torso Clavicle. The opponent’s clavicle (or collar bone) can be easily fractured, causing immobilization of the arm. Solar Plexus. Attacks to the opponent’s solar plexus or center of the chest can knock the breath out of him and immobilize him. Ribs. Damage to the opponent’s ribs immobilizes him. It may also cause internal trauma. Kidneys. Powerful attacks to the opponent’s kid- neys cause immobilization, permanent damage, or death. Groin The groin area is another soft tissue area not cov- ered by natural protection. Any damage to this ar- ea causes the opponent to involuntarily protect his injured area, usually with his hands or legs. In male opponents, the scrotum is the main target since even a near miss causes severe pain, con- traction of the lower abdominal muscles, deterio- ration of his stance, and possible internal trauma. Extremities Rarely will an attack to the opponent’s extremi- ties (arms and legs) cause death, but they are im- portant target areas in close combat. Damage to an opponent’s joints causes immobilization. 4. Pressure Points of the Body There are nerves in the human body that, when pressure is applied or when they are struck, allow Marines to control a subject through pain compli- ance. Marines use pressure points to control an opponent when deadly force is not authorized. They also use pressure points to soften or distract an opponent so a lethal or nonlethal technique can be employed. The figure on page 1-5 illustrates"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Close Combat _____________________________________________________________________________________________ 1-5 the body’s pressure points. Marines execute at- tacks to pressure points by— l Rapidly kicking or striking pressure points. l Slowly applying steady pressure to pressure points. Infraorbital Nerve The infraorbital nerve is just below the nose. Marines apply pressure to this nerve with an in- dex finger to control the opponent. Mastoid Process The mastoid process is behind the base of the ear and beneath the edge of the jaw. Marines apply inward and upward pressure to this pressure point with the fingers to distract and control the oppo- nent. Jugular Notch The jugular notch is at the base of the neck in the notch formed at the center of the clavicle. Marines apply pressure in a quick, stabbing motion with the index finger. Strikes to the jugular notch cause serious damage. Brachial Plexus (Tie In) The brachial plexus (tie in) is on the front of the shoulder at the joint. Strikes and pressure applied with the hand are effective on this nerve. Radial Nerves Radial nerves are on the inside of the forearms along the radius bones. Strikes and pressure ap- plied with the hand to the radial nerve serve as a softening technique."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"1-6 _______________________________________________________________________________________________ MCRP 3-02B Ulnar Nerve Ulnar nerves are on the outside of the forearms along the ulnar bones. Strikes and pressure ap- plied with the hand to the ulnar nerve serve as a softening technique. Pressure Point on the Hand The hands contain a pressure point on the web- bing between the thumbs and index fingers where the two bones of the fingers meet. To force an opponent to soften or release his grip, Marines apply pressure with their index fingers to this pressure point or strike this pressure point with their fists. Femoral Nerves Femoral nerves are on the inside of the thighs along the femur bones. Strikes to the femoral nerve serve as a softening technique. Peroneal Nerves Peroneal nerves are on the outside of the thighs along the femur bones. Strikes to the peroneal nerve serve as a softening technique. Pressure Points on the Feet There are pressure points on the feet that, when pressure is applied or when they are struck, serve to soften or distract the opponent. Marines apply pressure with the toe, edge, or heel of their boots to the following points: l The notch below the ball of the ankle. l The top center of the foot, above the toes. l The top of the foot where the leg and foot meet. 5. Basic Warrior Stance Achieving a solid stance is critical to stability and movement throughout any close combat confron- tation. The basic warrior stance provides the foun- dation for stability and movement that is needed to execute close combat techniques. To execute the basic warrior stance, Marines put their feet apart, hands up, elbows in, and chin down. Feet Apart Place feet shoulder-width apart. Keep the head forward and eyes on the opponent, take a half step forward with the left foot, and pivot on the heels so the hips and shoulders are at approximately a 45-degree an- gle to the right. Distribute body weight evenly on both legs. Bend the knees slightly. Hands Up Curl the fingers naturally into the palm of the hand. Position the thumb across the index and middle fingers. Do not clench the fists. Clenching the fists increases muscular tension in the fore- arms and decreases speed and reaction time. Bring the hands up to the face at chin level, with the palms facing each other. Hold the fists up high enough to protect the head, but not so high that they block the field of vision. Ensure continuous eye contact with the opponent. Elbows In Tuck the elbows in close to protect the body. Chin Down Tuck the chin down to take advantage of the natu- ral protection provided by the shoulders."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Close Combat _____________________________________________________________________________________________ 1-7 6. Angles of Approach and Movement Marines use movement to control a confrontation and to retain a tactical advantage. Movement in- creases power and maximizes momentum. By moving around the opponent, Marines gain access to different target areas of the opponent’s body. Movement allows Marines to use different weap- ons of the body and different close combat tech- niques to attack specific target areas. Angles of Approach Marines move anywhere within a 360-degree cir- cle around the opponent to gain a tactical advan- tage. This circle provides access to different target areas of the opponent’s body. When facing an opponent, Marines move in a 45- degree angle to either side of the opponent. Mov- ing at a 45-degree angle avoids an opponent’s strike and puts Marines in the best position to at- tack the opponent. Marines should avoid being directly in front of an opponent during a confron- tation. If a Marine is directly in front of an oppo- nent, the opponent can rely on his forward momentum and linear power to seize the tactical advantage. Movement Marines must know how to move in all directions while maintaining the basic warrior stance. Dur- ing any movement, the legs or feet should not be crossed. Once a movement is completed, the basic warrior stance should be resumed. Maintaining the basic warrior stance protects Marines and puts them in the proper position to launch an attack against an opponent. Note: Before body movement begins, Marines turn their heads quickly to the new direction. The faster the head turns, the faster the body moves, and the quicker Marines attain visual contact with the opponent. Forward to the Left. To move forward to the left from the basic warrior stance, Marines— l Move the left foot forward at a 45-degree angle from the body (approximately 12 to 15 inches), keeping the toe pointed toward the opponent. l Bring the right foot behind the left foot as soon as the left foot is in place. This returns Marines to the basic warrior stance. Forward to the Right. To move forward to the right from the basic warrior stance, Marines— l Move the right foot forward at a 45-degree angle from the body (approximately 12 to 15 inches). l Bring the left foot, toe pointing toward the opponent, in front of the right foot as soon as the right foot is in place. This returns Marines to the basic warrior stance. Backward to the Left. To move backward to the left from the basic warrior stance, Marines exe- cute the forward movement in reverse. Marines— l Move the left foot backward at a 45-degree angle from the body (approximately 12 to 15 inches), keeping the toe pointed toward the opponent. l Bring the right foot behind the left foot as soon as the left foot is in place. This returns Marines to the basic warrior stance. Backward to the Right. To move backward to the right from the basic warrior stance, Marines execute the forward movement in reverse. Marines— l Move the right foot backward at a 45-degree angle from the body (approximately 12 to 15 inches). l Bring the left foot, toe pointing toward the opponent, in front of the right foot as soon as the right foot is in place. This returns Marines to the basic warrior stance."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"1-8 _______________________________________________________________________________________________ MCRP 3-02B 7. Balance and Off-Balancing Balance In any close combat situation, Marines must strive to maintain balance. The last place to be in a close combat situation is on the ground. Marines must maintain a strong base and a low center of bal- ance, their feet must be a shoulder-width apart, and they must stay on their toes to enable quick movement. Off-balancing Marines use off-balancing techniques to control an opponent. These techniques are used to throw an opponent to the ground while Marines remain standing, or they are used to put Marines in a po- sition for an offensive attack. Off-balancing techniques use the opponent’s mo- mentum to move or throw him. For example, if the opponent is charging a Marine, the Marine pulls the opponent to drive him to the ground. Likewise, if the opponent is pulling a Marine, the Marine pushes the opponent to drive him to the ground. Off-balancing techniques also rely on the power generated by the opponent. For example, during combat a Marine may be tired or outnumbered. Depending on the generated energy and momen- tum of the opponent, the Marine employs off-bal- ancing techniques with very little effort and still provides effective results. Because off-balancing techniques rely on the mo- mentum and power generated by the opponent, these techniques are particularly effective for Marines who may be outsized by their opponent or lack their opponent’s strength. Angles of Off-balancing There are eight angles or directions in which an opponent can be off-balanced: forward, rear, right, left, forward right, forward left, rear right, and rear left. Note: The angles correspond to the Marine’s perspective, not the opponent’s. Forward, rear, right, and left are straight angles. Forward right, forward left, rear right, and rear left are consid- ered quadrants that are at a 45-degree angle in either direction to the front or rear. Off-balancing Techniques Marines off-balance an opponent by pushing, pulling, or bumping the opponent with their hands, arms, or bodies. To pull, Marines grab an opponent with their hands and drive him forcefully to one of the rear quadrants or to the right or left."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Close Combat _____________________________________________________________________________________________ 1-9 To push, Marines grab the opponent with their hands and drive him forcefully into one of the front quadrants or to the right or left. Marines execute bumping in the same manner as pushing, but use their shoulders, hips, and legs in- stead of their hands to off-balance the opponent. 8. Falls Marines may lose their balance or be thrown to the ground during encounters with an opponent. Marines use falling techniques to absorb the im- pact of a fall and to quickly return to their feet fol- lowing an opponent’s attack. Whether falling or being thrown by an opponent, Marines strive to reduce the force of the impact, to prevent serious personal injury, and to increase the chances of survival. Falling techniques use the body’s large muscles (back, thighs, buttocks) to protect vital organs and bones from injury and im- mobilization. Front Fall Marines execute a front fall to break a fall on the front. To execute the front fall, Marines— Bend the elbows and place the palms facing out in a position to spread and absorb the impact of the fall. Fall forward, breaking the fall with the forearms and palms. The forearms and hands, down to the fingertips, should strike the ground simultaneous- ly. Offer resistance with the forearms and hands to keep the head raised off the ground. Side Fall Marines execute a side fall to break a fall on the side. To execute the side fall, Marines— Bring the right arm across the body so the hand is next to the left shoulder with the palm facing in- board. Fall to the side, breaking the fall with the right arm by slapping the ground and making contact from the shoulder or forearm down to the hand. At the same time, tuck the chin and keep the head"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"1-10 ______________________________________________________________________________________________ MCRP 3-02B raised off the ground. The chin should be tucked to the chest at all times to prevent whiplash. Stretch the right leg out to make contact with the ground and to distribute and absorb the impact. Bend the left leg, allowing the foot to make con- tact with the ground. Back Fall Marines execute a back fall to break the fall when being thrown or falling backward. To execute the back fall, Marines— Cross the hands in front of the chest and tuck the chin. Fall backward and slap the ground with the fore- arms and hands to absorb the impact of the fall and keep the head off the ground. Forward Shoulder Roll Marines use the forward shoulder roll to break a fall from an opponent’s attack and to use the mo- mentum of the fall to get back on their feet quick- ly. Ideally, Marines execute the forward shoulder roll to a standing position so they can continue fighting. To execute the forward shoulder roll, Marines— Contact the ground with the back of the right fore- arm and upper arm. Tuck the chin into the chest. Roll onto the right shoulder, rolling diagonally across the back to land on the left hip. Slap the ground with the left arm, absorbing the impact from the shoulder to the hand, palm down."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Close Combat ___________________________________________________________________________________________ 1-11 Keep the left leg straight to absorb as much of the impact as possible. The right leg is bent and the foot hits flat on the ground. Bend the left leg upon impact to push off with the left knee and leg to a squatting and then a stand- ing position. Forward momentum should carry the Marine to a standing position.

In photographs, the Marine is depicted in woodland camouflage utilities; the oppo- nent is depicted in desert camouflage utilities. 1. Bayonet Techniques WARNING During training, Marines must have bayonets sheathed. Marines use bayonet dummies to practice bayonet techniques. When practic- ing offensive and defensive bayonet tech- niques student-on-student, Marines use pugil sticks. All Marines armed with a rifle carry a bayonet. The bayonet is an effective weapon if Marines are properly trained in offensive and defensive bayo- net techniques. An offensive attack, such as a thrust, is a devastating attack that can quickly end a fight. Defensive techniques, such as the block and parry, can deter the opponent’s attack and al- low Marines to regain the initiative. Through proper training, Marines develop the courage and confidence required to effectively use a bayonet to protect themselves and destroy the enemy. In situations where friendly and enemy troops are closely mingled and rifle fire and grenades are impractical, the bayonet becomes the weapon of choice. Holding the Rifle To execute bayonet techniques, Marines hold the rifle in a modified basic warrior stance. All move- ment begins and ends with the basic warrior stance. To hold the rifle, Marines— Use an overhanded grasp to grab the small of the rifle’s stock. Use an underhanded grasp to grab the hand- guards of the rifle. Lock the buttstock of the rifle against the hip with the right forearm. Orient the blade end of the rifle toward the opponent. Offensive Bayonet Techniques Straight Thrust. Marines use the straight thrust to disable or kill an opponent. It is the most dead- ly offensive technique because it causes the most trauma to an opponent. Target areas are the oppo- nent’s throat, groin, or face. The opponent’s chest and stomach are also excellent target areas if not"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"2-2 _______________________________________________________________________________________________ MCRP 3-02B protected by body armor or combat equipment. To execute the straight thrust, Marines— Lift the left leg and lunge forward off the ball of the right foot while thrusting the blade end of the weapon forward, directly toward the opponent. Retract the weapon and return to the basic warrior stance. Slash. Marines use the slash to kill an opponent or to create an opening in his defense. The target area is the opponent’s neck. To execute the slash, Marines— Extend the left hand back toward the left shoul- der. Thrust the left hand forward and swing it to the right, bring the right hand back toward the hip, and turn the cutting edge of the blade toward the opponent’s neck. The movement is a slashing mo- tion so the blade cuts across the opponent’s neck. Horizontal Buttstroke. Marines use the horizon- tal buttstroke to weaken an opponent’s defenses, to cause serious injury, or to set him up for a kill- ing blow. Target areas are the opponent’s head, neck, and legs. To execute the horizontal buttstroke, Marines— Step forward with the right foot and drive the right hand forward. Rotate the hips and shoulders into the strike. Move the left hand back toward the left shoulder. Strike the opponent with the butt of the weapon. Vertical Buttstroke. Marines use the vertical buttstroke to weaken an opponent’s defenses, to cause serious injury, or to set him up for a killing"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Close Combat _____________________________________________________________________________________________ 2-3 blow. Target areas are the opponent’s groin and face. To execute the vertical buttstroke, Marines— Step forward with the right foot and drive the right hand straight up. Pull the left hand back over the left shoulder. Strike the opponent with the butt of the weapon. Smash. Marines use the smash as a follow-up technique to the horizontal or vertical buttstroke, particularly if they missed the target. The target area is the opponent’s head. To execute the smash following a buttstroke, Marines— Step forward with the right foot and place the blade end of the weapon over the left shoulder and elevate the right elbow above the shoulders. Drive the arms straight forward, striking the op- ponent with the butt of the weapon. Defensive Bayonet Techniques Parry. Marines use a parry as a defensive tech- nique to redirect or deflect an attack. A parry is a slight redirection of a linear attack by an oppo- nent; e.g., a straight thrust or a smash. To execute the parry, Marines— Use the bayonet end of the rifle to redirect the barrel or bayonet of the opponent’s weapon. Lock the weapon against the hip with the right forearm. Rotate to the right or left, moving the bayonet end of the rifle to parry the opponent’s attack. Rota- tion is generated from the hips."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"2-4 _______________________________________________________________________________________________ MCRP 3-02B Redirect or guide the opponent’s weapon away from the body by exerting pressure against the op- ponent’s weapon. High Block. Marines execute a high block against a vertical attack coming from high to low. To exe- cute the high block, Marines— Thrust the arms up forcefully at approximately a 45-degree angle from the body. The weapon should be over the top of the head and parallel to the ground. The elbows are bent, but there is enough muscular tension in the arms to absorb the impact and deter the attack. Low Block. Marines execute the low block against a vertical attack coming from low to high. To execute the low block, Marines— Thrust the arms down forcefully at approximately a 45-degree angle from the body. The weapon should be at or below the waist and parallel to the ground. The elbows are bent, but there is enough muscular tension in the arms to absorb the impact and deter the attack. Left and Right Block. Marines execute a left or right block against a horizontal buttstroke or a slash. To execute the left or right block, Marines— Thrust the arms forcefully to the right or left, holding the rifle vertically in the direction of the attack. The elbows are bent, but there is enough muscular tension in the arms to absorb the impact and deter the attack. Counter Action Following the Block. After deflecting an opponent’s attack with a block, Marines counter with a slash or a horizontal buttstroke to regain the initiative. However, the objective in any bayonet fight is to thrust forward with the blade end of the weapon to immediately end the fight. Group Strategy On occasion, Marines may engage an opponent as a member of a group or numerous opponents by"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Close Combat _____________________________________________________________________________________________ 2-5 one’s self or as a member of a group. By combin- ing bayonet fighting movements and simple strat- egies, Marines can effectively overcome their opponent or opponents. Offensive Strategy: Two Against One. If two bayonet fighters engage one opponent, the fight- ers advance together. Fighter 1 engages the opponent while fighter 2 swiftly and aggressively attacks the opponent’s exposed flank and destroys the opponent. Offensive Strategy: Three Against Two. If three bayonet fighters engage two opponents, the fighters advance together keeping their opponents to the inside. Fighters 1 and 3 engage opponents. Fighter 2 at- tacks the opponent’s exposed flank engaged by fighter 1 and destroys the opponent. Fighters 1 and 2 turn and attack the exposed flank of the opponent engaged by fighter 3 and destroy the opponent. Defensive Strategy: One Against Two. If a fighter is attacked by two opponents, the fighter immediately positions himself at the flank of the nearest opponent and keeps that opponent be- tween himself and the other opponent. Using the first opponent’s body as a shield against the second opponent, the fighter destroys the first opponent quickly before the second opponent moves to assist. Then, the fighter engages and destroys the second opponent. Defensive Strategy: Two Against Three. If two fighters are attacked by three opponents, the fight- ers immediately move to the opponent’s flanks."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"2-6 _______________________________________________________________________________________________ MCRP 3-02B Fighters 1 and 2 quickly attack and destroy their opponents before the third opponent closes in. Fighter 1 engages the third opponent while fighter 2 attacks the opponent’s exposed flank and de- stroys the opponent. 2. Nonlethal Rifle and Shotgun Retention Techniques Most Marines are armed with the M16A2 service rifle. Marines are taught to keep their weapon with them at all times. Marines must be constantly alert to their surroundings and the people moving in and around their environment. Marines may be confronted by an individual who tries to take their weapons. If this happens, Marines should not struggle with the individual. To retain positive control of their weapons, Marines must under- stand and apply weapons retention techniques, otherwise known as armed manipulation. The fol- lowing techniques can be used with either the rifle or the shotgun. Blocking Technique To execute a blocking technique, Marines— Stand in a defensive posture. Use the weapon to block the opponent by thrust- ing it out firmly, with the elbows bent. Do not try to hit the opponent with the rifle. The rifle is used as a barrier. Technique if Opponent Grabs Weapon Underhanded Usually an opponent will try to grab the weapon or block it as an instinctive action. If the opponent uses an underhand grab to seize the handguards of the weapon, Marines— Trap the opponent’s closest finger(s) above the knuckle with the thumb so he cannot release his grip. Apply bone pressure on the opponent’s finger to initiate pain compliance."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Close Combat _____________________________________________________________________________________________ 2-7 Rotate the barrel of the weapon up or down quickly while maintain- ing pressure on the oppo- nent’s hand. At the same time, quickly pivot to off- balance the opponent. Technique if Opponent Grabs Weapon Overhanded If the opponent uses an overhand grab to seize the weapon overhanded, Marines— Trap the opponent’s finger to hold his hand in place. Rotate the barrel to place it across the opponent’s forearm and apply downward pressure. This ac- tion is similar to an armbar. Technique if the Opponent Grabs the Muzzle If the opponent grabs the muzzle of the weapon, Marines— Rotate the muzzle quickly in a circle motion. Slash downward with the muzzle to release the opponent’s grip. Butt Strikes Strikes with the butt of the weapon con- trol or ward off an attacker. During any of the retention techniques, Marines use the heel or cut- ting edge of the weapon to deliver butt strikes to the"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"2-8 _______________________________________________________________________________________________ MCRP 3-02B inside or the outside of the opponent’s thigh. The inside butt strike targets the femoral nerve as il- lustrated in the pho- to to the left. The outside butt strike targets the peroneal nerve as il- lustrated in the pho- to to the left. Strikes can be made to the outside or inside of the thighs. If a strike to one side of the thigh misses, Ma- rines follow back through with the butt of the weapon on the other side of the thigh. Off-balancing Techniques Marines apply off-balancing techniques to throw an opponent to the ground and retain possession of the weapon. If the opponent grabs the weapon and pushes, Marines should not push on the weapon. They should— Move with the momentum and movement of the opponent by pivoting in the direction of the movement by stepping back. Throw the opponent to the ground with a quick jerking movement by lowering the muzzle and swinging the butt of the weapon."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Close Combat _____________________________________________________________________________________________ 2-9 If the opponent grabs the weapon and pulls, Marines— Step on the opponent’s foot and push forward to off-balance him and drive him to the ground. Sweep the opponent’s feet out from under him by hooking his leg with the leg and kicking back- ward. 3. Nonlethal Handgun Retention Techniques Many Marines are armed with the M9 service pis- tol. Marines must keep their weapons in their pos- session at all times. Marines must be constantly alert to their surroundings and the people moving in and around the environment. Marines may be confronted by an individual who tries to take their weapons. To retain posi- tive control of the weap- on, Marines must understand and apply handgun retention tech- niques. Blocking Technique Marines perform the following blocking techniques if an oppo- nent attempts to grab their pistol in the holster. Marines— Place the body between the weapon and the oppo- nent by immediately pivoting so the weapon is away from the opponent. Step back and away from the opponent while placing the hand on the pistol grip. Extend the left hand and block, deflect, or strike the opponent’s arm. Armbar Technique Marines use the armbar technique when an oppo- nent uses his right hand to grab their pistol in the holster. To execute the armbar technique, Marines— Trap the opponent’s right hand by grasping the opponent’s wrist or hand with the right hand and applying pressure against the body."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"2-10 ______________________________________________________________________________________________ MCRP 3-02B Step back with the right foot and pivot sharply to the right to be next to the opponent. Always pivot in a direction that keeps the weapon away from the opponent. Straighten the opponent’s arm to apply an armbar. The arm should be straight across the torso. Continue pivoting to the right while pulling back on the opponent’s shoulder. This action may break the opponent’s arm."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Close Combat ___________________________________________________________________________________________ 2-11"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"2-12 ______________________________________________________________________________________________ MCRP 3-02B Place the left hand across the opponent’s face and apply pressure back and down to take the oppo- nent to the ground. Pressure applied beneath the nose or on the trachea is equally effective. Wristlock Technique Marines use the wristlock technique when an op- ponent grabs their pistol while it is in the holster with his right hand. To execute the wristlock tech- nique, Marines— Grasp the opponent’s wrist or hand with the right hand and apply pressure against the body. Step back and away from the opponent and pivot to the right so the weapon is away from the oppo- nent. Always pivot in a direction that keeps the weapon away from the opponent. Reach over the opponent’s arm with the left hand and grab his hand, applying pressure against his arm with the left forearm. Execute a wristlock. Incorporate the second hand into the wristlock and, stepping back with the left foot, pivot to the left. Execute a two-handed wristlock by exerting downward pressure with the thumb and rotating his hand to the left. Continue to pivot to off-balance the opponent and drive him to the ground. Note: If the opponent grabs the pistol with his left hand, Marines execute the wristlock with one hand and step in toward the opponent, rather than away from the opponent."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Close Combat ___________________________________________________________________________________________ 2-13 Softening Techniques Handgun retention techniques use softening tech- niques applied to pressure points. Bone pressure and strikes with the hands (i.e., hammer fist), knees, and feet are also effective softening tech- niques. Pressure Points. Marines use pressure point techniques to get the opponent to loosen his grip. Marines use their finger tips to apply pressure to the webbing between the index finger and thumb, the jugular notch, and the brachial plexus tie in. The following figure illustrates pressure applied to the brachial plexus tie in. Bone Pressure. Bone pressure is the application of pressure on a bone against a hard object to ini- tiate pain compliance. To apply bone pressure, Marines use their hand to trap the opponent’s hand on the weapon. Marines apply a slow, steady pressure to the opponent’s hand and fingers until his grip is softened or he releases his hold. Strikes. If it is difficult to apply a retention tech- nique, Marines employ strikes or kicks to force the opponent to loosen his grip. Strikes to the eyes, the arms (radial nerve), or shoulder (brachi- al plexus tie in) soften the opponent’s grip on the weapon. Kicks and knee strikes to the peroneal nerve, the femoral nerve, or the groin are effective because the opponent is typically unprepared to counter the strike."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"2-14 ______________________________________________________________________________________________ MCRP 3-02B Stomping on the top of the opponent’s foot may distract him or loosen his grip on the weapon. 4. Firearm Disarmament Techniques Marines use firearm disarmament techniques dur- ing a close-range confrontation if they are un- armed and the opponent has a firearm (pistol). These techniques are equally effective if Marines are armed but do not have time to withdraw and present the weapon. The goal of firearm disarma- ment techniques is to gain control of the situation so Marines gain the tactical advantage. The goal is not necessarily to get control of the opponent’s weapon. Pistol to the Front This technique is used when Marines are unarmed and the opponent has a pistol pointing at their front (e.g., head, chest). The technique is the same if the opponent sticks the pistol under the Marine’s chin. To execute the counter when an opponent is pointing a pistol toward the front of a Marine, Marines—"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Close Combat ___________________________________________________________________________________________ 2-15 Place the hands close to the weapon, about chest high, palms out.

To execute the counter when the opponent is pointing a pistol to the rear, Marines— Place the hands close together about chest high, palms out. Step back with the left foot, pivoting on the right foot so the side is against the opponent’s front. This action clears the body from the weapon’s line of fire. Keep the left hand up. Pivot on the left foot to face the opponent and, at the same time, raise the left elbow and reach over the top of the opponent’s arm with the left arm. Wrap the left arm tightly around the opponent’s arm above his elbow to control it. Push on the opponent’s shoulder with the right hand while pulling up with the left arm to achieve an armbar. This action releases the opponent’s grip on the weapon. If necessary, the opponent can be taken to the ground with a leg sweep. Note: To execute this technique, the weapon must be close to or touching the rear of the Marine. If the weapon is too far away from the body, this technique would be difficult to execute or it would be ineffective."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3 HAND-HELD WEAPONS This chapter describes all techniques for a right-handed person. However, all techniques can be executed from either side. In drawings, the Marine is depicted in woodland camouflage utili- ties; the opponent is depicted without camouflage. In photographs, the Marine is depicted in woodland camouflage utilities; the oppo- nent is depicted in desert camouflage utilities. Marines must know how to defend against attacks when an opponent is either unarmed or armed with a held-held weapon. This chapter addresses the combative use of knives, specific weapons of opportunity, and sticks. However, virtually any- thing can be used as a hand-held weapon. 1. Fundamentals of Knife Fighting Marines must be trained in knife fighting tech- niques. Marines experienced in offensive knife techniques can cause enough damage and massive trauma to stop an opponent. When engaged against each other, experienced knife fighters em- ploy various maneuvers and techniques that are specific to knife fighting. Seldom, if ever, will Marines engage an opponent in a classical knife fight. Note: When armed with a rifle, Marines are is- sued a bayonet. When armed with a pistol, Marine are issued a combat knife. Angles of Attack There are six angles from which an attack with a knife can be launched: l Vertical strike coming straight down on an opponent. l Forward diagonal strike coming in at a 45- degree angle to the opponent. l Reverse diagonal strike coming in at a 45- degree angle to the opponent. l Forward horizontal strike coming in parallel to the ground. l Reverse horizontal strike coming in parallel to the ground. l Forward thrust coming in a straight line to the opponent. Target Areas of the Body During any confrontation, the parts of the oppo- nent’s body that are exposed or readily accessible will vary. The goal in a knife fight is to attack the body’s soft, vital target areas that are readily ac- cessible (e.g, the face, the sides and front of the neck, the lower abdomen [or groin])."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"3-2 _______________________________________________________________________________________________ MCRP 3-02B Neck. Carotid arteries, located on either side of the neck, are good target areas because they are not covered by body armor or natural protection. Lower Abdomen (or Groin). The lower abdo- men (or groin region) is a good target area be- cause it is not covered by body armor. Heart. The heart, if not covered by body armor, is an excellent target which, if struck, can prove fa- tal in a matter of seconds or minutes. Secondary Targets. There are secondary target areas that will cause substantial bleeding if an ar- tery is severed. These target areas are not imme- diately fatal, but can become fatal if left unattended. Attacks to— l The legs can cause a great deal of trauma and prove fatal. For example, the femoral artery located on the inside of the thigh is a large artery which, if cut, will cause exten- sive blood loss. l The brachial artery, located between the bi- ceps and triceps on the inside of the arm, can cause extensive bleeding and damage. l The arm’s radial and ulnar nerves can cause extensive bleeding and damage. Movement Marines can move anywhere within a 360-degree circle around the opponent. This allows accessi- bility to different target areas of the opponent’s body. Marines should avoid being directly in front of an opponent because the opponent can rely on his forward momentum to seize the tactical ad- vantage. If Marines face an opponent, movement is made in a 45-degree angle to either side of the opponent. This angle avoids an opponent’s strike and places Marines in the best position to attack an opponent. Wearing the Combat Knife Marines must wear the combat knife where it is easily accessible and where it can best be retained. It is recom- mended the combat knife be worn on the weak side hip, blade down, sharp edge facing forward. Marines can place it behind the magazine pouch where it is easily accessible to them, but not easily grabbed by an opponent. Grip The grip on the knife should be natural. Marines grasp the knife’s grip with the fingers wrapped around the grip naturally as it is pulled out of its sheath. This is commonly known as a hammer grip. The blade end of the knife is always facing the opponent. Stance Marines use the basic warrior stance as the foun- dation for knife techniques. The left hand is a ver- tical shield that protects either the ribs or the head and neck. The right elbow is bent with the blade pointing forward toward the op- ponent’s head. This position serves as an index point, where all techniques are initiated."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Close Combat _____________________________________________________________________________________________ 3-3 Principles of Knife Fighting The following are key principles of knife fighting: l Execute movements with the knife blade within a box, shoulder-width across from the neck down to the waistline. The oppo- nent has a greater chance of blocking an at- tack if the blade is brought in a wide, sweeping movement to the opponent. l Close with the opponent, coming straight to the target. l Move with the knife in straight lines. l Point the knife’s blade tip forward and to- ward the opponent. l Apply full body weight and power in each of the knife techniques. Full body weight should be put into the attack in the direction of the blade’s movement (slash or thrust). l Apply constant forward pressure with the body and blade to keep the opponent off- balanced. 2. Knife Fighting Techniques Slashing Techniques Marines use slashing techniques to close with an enemy. Slashing techniques distract the opponent or damage the opponent so Marines can close in. Typically, Marines target the opponent’s limbs, but any portion of the body that is presented can become a target. Vertical Slash Technique. The vertical slash follows a vertical line straight down through the target. To execute the vertical slash, Marines— Thrust the right hand out and bring the weapon straight down on the opponent, continuing to drag the knife down through the opponent’s body. Maintain contact on the opponent’s body with the blade of the knife. Forward Slash Technique. The forward slash follows a straight line in a forehand stroke, across the target areas of either the neck (high diagonal slash) or abdominal region (low horizontal slash). To execute the forward slash, Marines— Extend the right hand while simultaneously rotat- ing the palm up until the knife blade makes con- tact with the opponent. Snap or rotate the wrist through the slashing mo- tion to maximize blade’s contact with the oppo- nent."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"3-4 _______________________________________________________________________________________________ MCRP 3-02B Drag the knife across the opponent’s body, from right to left, in a forehand stroke. The movement ends with the forearm against the body and the knife at the left hip with its blade oriented toward the opponent. Reverse Slash Technique. The reverse slash is a follow-up technique to a forward attack. It al- lows Marines both a secondary attack and the ability to resume the basic warrior stance. The re- verse slash follows a straight line in a backhand stroke, across the target areas of either the neck (high diagonal slash) or abdominal region (low horizontal slash). To execute the reverse slash, Marines— Extend the right hand while simultaneously rotat- ing the palm down until the knife blade makes contact with the opponent. Snap or rotate the wrist through the slashing mo- tion to maximize the blade’s contact with the op- ponent. Drag the knife across the opponent’s body, from left to right, in a backhand stroke. Maintain con- tact on the opponent’s body with the blade of the knife. Thrusting Techniques The primary objective of knife fighting is to insert the blade into an opponent to cause extensive damage and trauma. This is done with a thrusting technique. Thrusting techniques are more effec- tive than slashing techniques because of the dam- age they can inflict. However, Marines use slashing techniques to close with the enemy so that they are closer to the opponent, which allows them to use the thrusting technique. Vertical Thrust. The thrusting motion follows a vertical line straight up through the target (low in- to the abdomen region or high into the neck). To execute the vertical thrust, Marines— Thrust the right hand toward the target, inserting the knife blade straight into the opponent."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Close Combat _____________________________________________________________________________________________ 3-5 Pull the knife out of the opponent. Forward Thrust. The forward thrust follows a straight line straight into the opponent’s neck (high thrust) or abdominal region (low thrust). To execute the forward thrust, Marines— Thrust the right hand, palm down, toward the tar- get, inserting the knife blade straight into the op- ponent. Rotate the palm up once the knife is inserted to twist the blade. Drop the right elbow and bring the knife to the opposite side of the opponent’s body from where it was inserted. At the same time, rotate the hips and shoulders downward to bring body weight to bear on the attack. Reverse Thrust. The reverse thrust is a follow- up technique to a forward attack. It allows Marines both a secondary attack and the ability to resume the basic warrior stance. The reverse thrust follows a horizontal line straight into the opponent’s neck (high thrust) or abdominal re- gion (low thrust). To execute the reverse thrust, Marines— Bend the right arm, crossing the arm to the left side of the body. Thrust the right hand, palm up, toward the target, inserting the knife blade straight into the oppo- nent."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"3-6 _______________________________________________________________________________________________ MCRP 3-02B Rotate the palm down to twist the blade once the knife is inserted. Bring the knife to the opposite side of the oppo- nent’s body from where it was inserted. 3. Weapons of Opportunity During an unarmed close combat situation, Marines use their bodies as weapons, but they should be ready and able to use anything around them as a weapon. For example, Marines could throw sand or liquid in an opponent’s eyes to tem- porarily impair his vision or smash the opponent’s head with a rock or helmet. Marines must use whatever means are available and do whatever it takes to take control of the situation and to win, or they face the possibility of losing their lives. Some weapons of opportunity are discussed in the following subparagraphs. Entrenching Tool An entrenching tool (E-tool) is commonly carried by Marines. It can be an excellent weapon, espe- cially when sharpened. Marines can use the E- tool to block, slash, and thrust at an opponent. Tent Pole and Pins Marines can use tent poles and pins to block, strike, or thrust at an opponent. Web Belt Marines can stretch a web belt between their hands to block attacks by an opponent. Battlefield Debris Marines can use debris on the battlefield (e.g., sticks, glass, a sharp piece of metal) to cut, slash, or stab an opponent. They can also use other types of debris such as shovel or ax handles, boards, metal pipes, or broken rifles to strike an opponent or apply a choke. Helmet A helmet can be used to strike an opponent on an unprotected area like the head and face. Grasp the rim of the helmet and thrust the arms forward, striking the opponent with the top of the helmet. 4. Fundamentals of Combative Stick On the battlefield, Marines must be ready and able to use anything as a weapon. They must learn and be able to use techniques that can be em- ployed with most weapons of opportunity. Among these techniques are combative stick tech- niques. Combative stick techniques can be used with a stick, a club, a broken rifle, an E-tool, or even a web belt."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Close Combat _____________________________________________________________________________________________ 3-7 Angles of Attack There are six angles from which an attack with a hand-held weapon can be launched: l Vertical strike coming straight down on an opponent. l Forward diagonal strike coming in at a 45- degree angle to the opponent. l Reverse diagonal strike coming in at a 45- degree angle to the opponent. l Forward horizontal strike coming in parallel to the ground. l Reverse horizontal strike coming in parallel to the ground. l Forward thrust coming in a straight line to the opponent. Grip Grasp the stick about 2 inches from its base. Stance The basic warrior stance serves as the foundation for combative stick techniques. The left hand becomes a vertical shield that protects the ribs or the head and neck. Depending on how heavy the weapon is, it should be held at a level approximately shoul- der height. Movement Movement during combative stick techniques is the same as it is for other close combat tech- niques. Marines can move anywhere within a 360-degree circle around the opponent. This al- lows accessibility to different target areas of the opponent’s body and gains a tactical advantage. Marines should avoid being directly in front of an opponent because the opponent can rely on his forward momentum to seize the tactical advan- tage. If Marines face an opponent, movement is made in a 45-degree angle to either side of the op- ponent. This angle avoids an opponent’s strike and places Marines in the best position to attack an opponent. 5. Combative Stick Techniques Strikes Strikes are intended to inflict as much damage on an opponent as possible. Striking techniques ap- ply to a weapon of opportunity such as a stick, a tent pole, a club, a broken rifle, an E-tool, or a pipe. Vertical Strike.

Forward Thrust. To execute the forward thrust, Marines— Grasp the stick with the left hand, palm up, in a position where the stick can be controlled with two hands. Lift the left leg and lunge forward off the ball of the right foot. At the same time, thrust the end of the weapon directly toward the opponent by thrusting both hands forward in a straight line. 6. Blocking Techniques A block is meant to deter or deflect an attack by an opponent. A block sets up Marines for a fol- low-on attack against the opponent. Blocks are executed by deflecting, rather than hitting or fol- lowing through like a strike. Blocks Against Unarmed Attacks To block against an unarmed attack, Marines— Step forward at a 45-degree angle with either the right or left foot. This moves the body out of the line of attack."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"3-10 ______________________________________________________________________________________________ MCRP 3-02B Raise the left arm and block the strike with the meaty portion of the forearm. Employ the stick by one of two techniques: l Strike the opponent with the stick. l Use the stick to block on two points of con- tact. When the stick is used to block, it serves as an incidental strike. This tech- nique is only used if Marines have closed with the opponent and are inside his strike. Blocks Against Armed Attacks Block for a Vertical Strike. To execute the block for a vertical strike, Marines— Step forward with the left foot at a 45-degree an- gle to the left. This moves the body out of the line of attack. Block on two points of contact to disperse the im- pact of the attack: l Block the opponent’s stick by positioning the stick so it is perpendicular to the oppo- nent’s stick. If the stick is not perpendicular to the opponent’s stick, the stick can slide through and make contact on the Marine. l Block the opponent’s wrist or forearm with the back of the left forearm. Note: Use the stick to block the opponent’s arm if closer to the opponent. It is the same movement as blocking with the arm, except the opponent’s arm is blocked with both the stick and the arm. Block for a Forward Strike. To execute the block for a forward strike, Marines— Step forward with the left foot at a 45-degree an- gle to the left. This moves the body out of the line of attack and inside the opponent’s strike. Block on two points of con- tact to disperse the impact of the attack: l Block the opponent’s wrist or forearm with the meaty portion of the back of the left fore- arm. l Strike the opponent’s attacking biceps with the stick."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Close Combat ___________________________________________________________________________________________ 3-11 Block for a Reverse Strike.

Block the opponent’s forearm with the meaty por- tion of the left forearm. Note: If closer to the opponent, block his triceps with the back of the left forearm and strike his forearm with the stick. 7. Unarmed Against Hand- Held Weapons If Marines are engaged against an opponent with a knife, a stick, or some other weapon of opportu- nity, they must establish and maintain an offen- sive mindset, not a defensive mindset. Their survival depends on it. They cannot afford to think about getting cut or hurt. Angles of Attack Before Marines can learn to block or counter an attack with a hand-held weapon (e.g., knife, stick), they must know from what angle the oppo- nent is attacking. There are six angles from which an opponent will typically attack with a hand-held weapon: l Vertical strike coming in straight down on the Marine. l Forward diagonal strike coming in at a 45- degree angle to the Marine. l Reverse diagonal strike coming in at a 45- degree angle to the Marine. l Forward horizontal strike coming in parallel to the ground. l Reverse horizontal strike coming in parallel to the ground. l Forward thrust coming in a straight line to the Marine. Blocks If the opponent has a hand-held weapon (e.g., knife or stick), Marines parry the opponent’s hand or arm to block the attack. Basic Block. To execute the basic block tech- nique, Marines— Step forward at a 45-degree angle to move out of the line of the attack. Always step in the direction of the strike."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"3-12 ______________________________________________________________________________________________ MCRP 3-02B Thrust the forearms forward, hands up, against the opponent’s attacking arm.

Counters to Hand-Held Weapon Attacks Principles of Counters A counter is used to control the situation to regain the tactical advantage and end the fight. Regard- less of the type of weapon or angle of attack, the following principles apply to countering the at- tack with a hand-held weapon: l Move out of the line of attack. Movement is executed in a 45-degree angle forward to the left or right. l Block the attack. Note: The first two actions are taken simulta- neously. l Take control of the weapon by controlling the hand or arm that is holding the weapon. Never attempt to grab the opponent’s weap- on. l Execute the appropriate follow-up to end the fight; e.g., strikes, joint manipulations, throws, or takedowns (see chap. 8). Marines should continue to attack the oppo- nent until the fight ends. Counter Techniques There are two techniques that can be used to counter any armed attack: forward armbar counter and reverse armbar counter. These tech- niques can be used to counter a vertical attack, a forward diagonal strike, or a forward horizontal strike. With minor variations, the same tech- niques are used to counter reverse strikes. A third technique, the bent armbar counter, is used to counter a vertical attack. Forward Armbar Counter. To execute the for- ward armbar counter to an attack coming from a forward strike, Marines— Step forward with the left foot inside the oppo- nent’s attacking arm. Block the attack with both arms bent so the fore- arms make contact with the opponent’s biceps and forearm."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"3-14 ______________________________________________________________________________________________ MCRP 3-02B Slide the left arm over the opponent’s forearm and wrap the arm tightly around his arm, trapping the opponent’s attacking arm between the biceps and torso. Place the right hand on the opponent’s shoulder or upper arm to further control his arm and to effect an armbar. Execute an armbar and continue to exert steady pressure against the arm. Reverse Armbar Counter. To execute the re- verse armbar counter to an attack coming from a forward strike, Marines— Step forward with the left foot inside the oppo- nent’s attacking arm. Block the attack with both arms bent so the fore- arms make contact with the opponent’s biceps and forearm. Control the opponent’s arm with the left hand and pivot to the right so the back is against the oppo- nent’s side. Immediately slide the right arm over the opponent’s biceps and wrap the arm tightly around his arm, trapping the opponent’s attacking arm between the biceps and torso. Grasp the opponent’s wrist with the left hand and twist his thumb away from the body. Take the opponent to the ground with an armbar takedown if he does not drop the weapon from the wristlock.

In drawings, the Marine is depicted in woodland camouflage utili- ties; the opponent is depicted without camouflage. In photographs, the Marine is depicted in woodland camouflage utilities; the oppo- nent is depicted in desert camouflage utilities. Strikes are unarmed individual hitting techniques. Strikes use the hands, elbows, knees, feet, and, in some instances, other parts of the body as person- al weapons. Marines must know how to execute strikes effectively. They must also know how to counter strikes from an opponent. 1. Principles of Punches Muscle Relaxation Muscle relaxation is crucial when executing punches. The natural tendency in a fight is to tense up, which results in rapid fatigue and de- creased power generation. Marines who remain relaxed during a close combat situation generate greater speed, which results in greater generation of power. Relaxing the forearms generates speed and improves reaction time. At the point of im- pact, Marines clench the fist to cause damage to the opponent and avoid injury to the wrist and hand. Weight Transfer Weight transfer is necessary to generate power in a punch. Marines accomplish this by— l Rotating their hips and shoulders into the at- tack. l Moving their body mass straight forward or backward in a straight line. l Dropping their body weight into an oppo- nent. Body mass can be transferred into an attack from high to low or from low to high. Rapid Retraction When Marines deliver a punch, rapid retraction of the fist is important. Once the hand has made contact with the target, Marines quickly return to the basic warrior stance. Rapid retraction— l Returns the hand and arm to the protection afforded by the basic warrior stance. l Prevents the opponent from being able to grab the hand or arm. l Permits the hand and arm to be “cham- bered” or “re-cocked” in preparation for de- livering a subsequent punch. Telegraphing Telegraphing a strike occurs when body move- ments inform the opponent of the intention to launch an attack. Staying relaxed helps to reduce telegraphing. Often, an untrained fighter telegraphs his inten- tion to attack by drawing his hand back in view of his opponent, changing facial expression, tensing neck muscles, or twitching. These movements,"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"4-2 _______________________________________________________________________________________________ MCRP 3-02B however small, immediately indicate an attack is about to be delivered. If the opponent is a trained fighter, he may be able to evade or counter the at- tack. If the opponent is an untrained fighter, he may still be able to minimize the effect of an at- tack. 2. Punches Punches may be thrown during any hand-to-hand confrontation. Most people resort to punching be- cause it is a natural reaction to a threat. The pur- pose of a punch is to stun the opponent or to set him up for a follow-up finishing technique. How- ever, punches should only be executed to the soft tissue areas of an opponent. A correctly delivered punch maximizes the damage to an opponent while minimizing the risk of injury to Marines. Basic Fist Punches are executed using the basic fist. To make the basic fist, the fingers are curled natural- ly into the palm of the hand and the thumb is placed across the index and middle fingers. Do not clench the fist until movement has begun. This reduces muscular tension in the forearm and increases speed and reac- tion time. Just before im- pact, Marines exert muscular tension on the hand and forearm to maxi- mize damage to the oppo- nent and reduce their chances of injury. Con- tact should be made with the knuckles of the index and middle fingers. When striking with the basic fist, Marines must keep the hand straight, or in line, with the wrist to avoid injury to the wrist. Lead Hand Punch The lead hand punch is a snapping straight punch executed by the forward or lead hand. It is a fast punch designed to keep the opponent away and to set up an attack. A lead hand punch conceals movement and allows Marines to get close to the opponent. Lead hand punches should strike soft tissue areas, if possible. To execute the lead hand punch, Marines— Snap the lead hand out to nearly full extension, while rotating the palm to the ground. Contact the opponent with the first two knuckles of the fist. Retract the hand immediately, resuming the basic warrior stance. Rear Hand Punch The rear hand punch is a snapping punch execut- ed by the rear (right) hand. It is a power punch designed to inflict maximum damage on the op- ponent. Its power comes from pushing off the rear leg and rotating the hips and shoulders. To execute the rear hand punch, Marines— Picture shows finger position only."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Close Combat _____________________________________________________________________________________________ 4-3 Rotate the hips and shoulders forcefully toward the opponent and thrust the rear hand straight out, rotating the palm down, to nearly full extension. Shift body weight to the lead foot while pushing off on the ball of the rear foot. Contact the opponent with the first two knuckles of the fist. Retract the hand immediately. Uppercut The uppercut is a powerful punch originating be- low the opponent’s line of vision. It is executed in an upward motion traveling up the centerline of the opponent’s body. It is delivered in close and usually follows a preparatory strike that leaves the target area unprotected. When delivered to the chin or jaw, the uppercut can render an opponent unconscious, cause extensive damage to the neck, or sever the tongue. To execute the uppercut, Marines— Bend the arms, rotating the palm inboard. The distance the arms bend depends on how close the opponent is. Rotate the hips and shoulders forcefully toward the opponent, thrusting the fist straight up toward the opponent’s chin or jaw. Contact the opponent with the first two knuckles of the fist. Retract the hand immediately. Hook The hook is a powerful punch that is executed close in and is usually preceded by a preparatory strike. To execute the hook, Marines—"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"4-4 _______________________________________________________________________________________________ MCRP 3-02B Thrust the right arm in a hooking motion toward the opponent, keeping the elbow bent while forcefully rotating the right shoulder and hip to- ward the opponent.

Strikes with the Upper Body Strikes stun the opponent or set him up for a fol- low-up finishing technique. The hands, forearms, and elbows are individual weapons of the arms that can be used to execute strikes including the hammer fist, chin jab, knife hand, eye gouge, and elbow strikes. These strikes provide a variety of techniques that can be used in any type of close combat situation. Principles of Execution There are several principles of execution that en- sure a strike’s effectiveness. Generating Power. Weight transfer is necessary to generate maximum power in a punch. Marines accomplish this by— l Rotating the hips and shoulders into the at- tack. l Moving the body mass straight forward or backward in a straight line. l Dropping body weight into an opponent. Body mass can be transferred into an attack from high to low or from low to high. Muscular Tension. The arms are relaxed until the moment of impact. At the point of impact, Marines apply muscular tension in the hand and forearm to maximize damage to the opponent and to avoid injury to the hand. The arms are relaxed until the moment of impact. Hit and Stick and Follow-Through. A strike should be delivered so that the weapon (e.g., hand, elbow) hits and remains on the impact site (target) and follows through the target. This tech- nique inflicts maximum damage on the opponent. Strikes with the arms are executed with “heavy hands”; i.e., the strike is executed by driving through with the strike to allow the weight of the hand to go through the target area of the body. Contact with the opponent should be made with the arm slightly bent, and the arm extends as it moves through the target. This technique allows Marines to deliver strikes effectively without exe- cuting full force. Movement. Movement puts Marines in the prop- er position for launching an attack against an op- ponent as well as providing protection."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Close Combat _____________________________________________________________________________________________ 4-5 Movement is initiated from the basic warrior stance and ends by resuming the basic warrior stance. Strikes can be performed with either the left or right arm depending upon— l The angle of attack. l The position of the opponent. l The opponent’s available, vulnerable target areas. Target Areas of the Body For each strike, there are target areas of the body that, when struck, maximize damage to an oppo- nent. Strikes use gross motor skills as opposed to fine motor skills. The target areas of the body are just that—areas. Pinpoint accuracy on a specific nerve is not needed for the strike to be effective. Hammer Fist Striking with the hammer fist concentrates power in a small part of the hand, which, when trans- ferred to the target, can have a devastating effect. The striking surface of the hammer fist is the meaty portion of the hand below the little finger. To execute the hammer fist strike, Marines— Make a fist and bend the arm at approximately a 45- to 90- degree angle. At the same time, rotate the right hip and right shoulder backward. Thrust the fist forward onto the opponent while rotating the right hip and shoulder for- ward. Rotate the wrist so the hammer fist makes contact on the opponent. Chin Jab The chin jab can immediately render an opponent unconscious and cause extensive damage to the neck and spine. The striking surface is the heel of the palm of the hand. To execute the chin jab, Marines— Bend the right wrist back at a 90-degree angle with the palm facing the opponent and the fingers pointing up. Keep the right arm bent and close to the body. Ex- tend the hand into a concave position with the fin- gers slightly spread apart."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"4-6 _______________________________________________________________________________________________ MCRP 3-02B Step forward with the left foot toward the oppo- nent, keeping the feet approximately shoulder- width apart and the knees bent. This is done to close with the opponent. Keep the right arm bent and close to the side. Thrust the palm of the hand directly up under the opponent’s chin. At the same time, rotate the right hip forward to drive the body weight into the at- tack to increase the power of the strike. The at- tack should travel up the centerline of the opponent’s chest to his chin. Knife Hand The knife hand is one of the most versatile and devastating strikes. The striking surface is the cutting edge of the hand, which is the meaty por- tion of the hand below the little finger extending to the top of the wrist. The striking surface is narrow, allowing strikes on the neck between the opponent’s body armor and helmet. The knife hand strike is executed from one of three angles: outside, inside, and verti- cal. Outside Knife Hand. To execute the outside knife hand strike, Marines— Execute a knife hand by extending and joining the fingers of the right hand and placing the thumb next to the forefinger (like saluting). Retract the right hand. At the same time, rotate the right hip and right shoulder backward. Thrust the knife hand forward (horizontally) onto the opponent while rotating the right hip and shoulder forward. Inside Knife Hand. To execute the inside knife hand strike, Marines— Execute a knife hand. Bring the right hand over the left shoulder. At the same time, rotate the right shoulder forward and the left hip forward."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Close Combat _____________________________________________________________________________________________ 4-7 Thrust the knife hand forward (horizontally) onto the opponent while rotating the right hip and shoulder forward and the left shoulder backward. Vertical Knife Hand. When thrown vertically, the knife hand strike comes straight down in a straight line. Eye Gouge The eye gouge is used to attack an opponent’s eyes, blinding him so follow-up strikes can be ex- ecuted. The striking surface is the tips of the fin- gers or thumb. To execute the eye gouge, Marines— Extend the right hand with the fingers slightly spread apart to allow entry into the eye sockets. Place the palm of the hand either toward the ground or toward the sky and thrust the right hand forward into the oppo- nent’s eyes. Thrust the hand forward at the oppo- nent’s nose level so the fingers or thumb slide naturally into the grooves of the opponent’s eye sock- ets. Elbow Strikes The elbow is a powerful weapon that can be used in several different ways to attack virtually any part of an opponent’s body. Elbow strikes can be performed either vertically (upward or down- ward) or horizontally (forward or reverse). The"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"4-8 _______________________________________________________________________________________________ MCRP 3-02B striking surface is 2 inches above or below the point of the elbow, depending upon the angle of attack, the opponent’s attack angle, and the posi- tion of the opponent.

The fist is at shoulder level and the elbow is next to the torso. Thrust the elbow vertically upward toward the op- ponent while rotating the right shoulder and hip forward to generate additional power. Contact the opponent with the right forearm 2 inches above the point of the elbow. Vertical Elbow Strike (Down). To execute a downward vertical elbow strike, Marines— Bend the right elbow, keeping the fist close to the body. The fist is on the shoulder and the elbow is raised well above the shoulder. Thrust the elbow vertically downward toward the opponent while dropping body weight into the at- tack to generate additional power.

Contact the opponent with the right triceps 2 inch- es above the point of the elbow. 4. Strikes with the Lower Body The legs are the body’s most powerful weapons because they use the largest muscle groups to generate a strike. Legs are also less prone to inju- ry. The feet are the preferred choice for striking because they are protected by boots. Marines use their feet, heels, and knees to execute kicks, knee strikes, and stomps. Kicks The purpose of a kick is to stop an opponent’s at- tack or to create an opening in his defense in order to launch an attack. Kicks can be performed with the left (lead) leg or the right (rear) leg. Kicks with the rear leg have greater power because the hips are rotated into the attack. However, the rear leg is further away from the opponent so a strike with the rear leg will not contact the opponent as quickly as a strike with the lead leg. Front Kick. The front kick is executed when the opponent is in front of the Marine. The front kick, delivered with either the rear or lead leg, is effective for striking below the waist. Attempting to kick higher results in diminished balance and provides the enemy with a greater opportunity to grab the leg or foot. The striking surfaces are the toe of the boot or the bootlaces. To execute the front kick, Marines— Raise the left knee waist high, pivot the hips into the attack, and thrust the left foot forward toward the opponent. Contact the opponent with the toe of the left boot or bootlaces. Return to the basic warrior stance. Side Kick. The side kick, delivered with the lead leg, is effective for striking the knees. The side kick is executed when the opponent is to the side of the Marine. The striking surface is the outside cutting edge of the boot near the heel. To execute the side kick, Marines—"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Close Combat ___________________________________________________________________________________________ 4-11 Raise the right knee waist high and rotate the right hip forward.

The knee strike is generally delivered in close. Vertical Knee Strike. The striking surface is the thigh, slightly above the knee. To execute the vertical knee strike, Marines— Raise the right knee and drive it up forcefully into the opponent. Power is generated by thrusting the leg upward. Contact the opponent 2 inches above the right knee. Horizontal Knee Strike. The horizontal knee strike is executed with the leg generally parallel with the ground while rotating the hips to gener- ate power. It is often delivered to the peroneal nerve. The striking surface is the front of the leg, slightly above or below the knee. To execute the horizontal knee strike, Marines— Raise the right knee, rotate the right hip forward while pivoting on the left foot, and drive the knee horizontally into the opponent. Contact the opponent 2 inches above the right knee."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"4-12 ______________________________________________________________________________________________ MCRP 3-02B Stomps Stomps are delivered with the feet, usually when the opponent is down. Remember, when the op- ponent is down, Marines take whatever target is available. Vertical Stomp. The vertical stomp allows Marines to remain upright and balanced, to rapid- ly deliver multiple blows with either foot, and to quickly and accurately attack the target. It is the preferred stomp. The striking surface is the flat bottom of the boot or the cutting edge of the heel. To execute the vertical stomp, Marines— Raise the right knee above the waist with the right leg bent at approximately a 90-degree angle. Drive the flat bottom of the right boot or the cut- ting edge of the right heel down onto the oppo- nent forcefully. At the same time, bend the left knee slightly to drop the body weight into the strike. Ax Stomp. The striking surface of the ax stomp is the cutting edge of the heel. To execute the ax stomp, Marines— Raise the right heel above the waist, keeping the right leg straight. Drive the cutting edge of the right heel down onto the opponent forcefully. At the same time, bend the left knee slightly to drop the body weight into the strike. 5. Counters to Strikes In a close combat situation, an opponent will at- tempt to strike Marines with punches and kicks. When an opponent uses a strike, Marines must first avoid the strike. This is accomplished by moving quickly and blocking. Next, Marines must get into an offensive position. This allows Marines to use offensive strikes to attack the op- ponent. Regardless of the strike, the counter to a strike requires Marines to move, block, and strike. Move The first step in countering a strike is to move out of the way of the strike’s impact. Movement re- moves Marines from the opponent’s intended strike point and positions Marines to attack. Movement is executed at approximately a 45-de- gree angle to the front or rear. Movement is al- ways initiated from the basic warrior stance. Return to the basic warrior stance with the toe of"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Close Combat ___________________________________________________________________________________________ 4-13 the lead foot pointing toward the opponent once the movement is complete. Block Different blocks are executed based on the strike. These will be covered by individual counters. Strike Any of the upper body or lower body strikes can be executed as a follow-on attack or part of the counter to an opponent’s strike. The follow-on strike is determined by the angle to the opponent, the position of the opponent, and the opponent’s available vulnerable target areas. Counters to Punches Counter to a Lead Hand Punch. This counter is used when the opponent throws a lead hand punch. To execute the counter to the lead hand punch, Marines— Step forward and to the left at approximately a 45-degree angle, moving in to the outside of the opponent’s attacking arm.

The Marine is depicted in camouflage utilities. The opponent is depicted without camouflage. Marines use throwing techniques to maintain the tactical advantage and to throw the opponent to the ground during close combat. Throws apply the principles of balance, leverage, timing, and body position to upset an opponent’s balance and to gain control by forcing the opponent to the ground. Throwing techniques are effective be- cause they are size- and gender-neutral, and they rely on the momentum and power generated by the opponent rather than the strength or size of the Marine. Marines also execute a throw as a devas- tating attack against an opponent, possibly caus- ing unconsciousness or broken limbs. When Marines execute throws, they must maintain bal- ance and, simultaneously, prevent the opponent from countering a throw or escaping after being forced to the ground. 1. Turning Throw Marines use a turning throw to take the opponent to the ground while they remain standing. A turn- ing throw can also be executed from a stationary position. It is particularly effective if Marines and the opponent are wearing gear. To execute the turning throw, Marines— Grasp the opponent’s right wrist with the left hand."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"5-2 _______________________________________________________________________________________________ MCRP 3-02B Step forward with the right foot, place it against the outside of the opponent’s right foot, and pivot so the back of the heel is next to the middle of the opponent’s foot.

Hip Throw Marines use a hip throw to take the opponent to the ground while they remain standing. A hip throw is particularly effective if the opponent is moving forward or pushing. Marines use the op- ponent’s forward momentum to execute the hip throw. To execute the hip throw, Marines— Grasp the opponent’s right wrist with the left hand.

However, all techniques can be executed from either side. The Marine is depicted in camouflage utilities. The opponent is depicted without camouflage. When Marines correctly perform a choke, they render an opponent unconscious in as little as 8 to 13 seconds. Chokes are easily performed regard- less of size or gender. Marines must know how to apply chokes and how to counter a choke or a hold executed by an opponent. 1. Types of Chokes There are two types of chokes: an air choke and a blood choke. An air choke closes off the airway to the lungs, thereby preventing oxygen from reach- ing the heart. A blood choke cuts off the blood flow to the brain. Both types can result in uncon- sciousness and eventual death for an opponent. Air Choke An air choke is performed on the opponent’s windpipe (or trachea), cutting off the air to the lungs and heart. If Marines execute the air choke properly, the opponent loses consciousness within 2 to 3 minutes. Due to the length of time it takes to immobilize the opponent, air chokes are not recommended. Blood Choke A blood choke is performed on the opponent’s ca- rotid artery, which carries oxygen-enriched blood from the heart to the brain. The carotid artery is located on both sides of the neck. If Marines exe- cute a blood choke properly, the opponent will lose consciousness within 8 to 13 seconds. The blood choke is the preferred choke because its in- tended effect (i.e., the opponent losing conscious- ness) can be executed quickly, ending the fight. 2.

Counters to Chokes and Holds During a close combat situation, an opponent may apply a choke or hold on a Marine. If the oppo- nent correctly applies a choke, a Marine quickly loses consciousness. If a choke is not executed properly, it often results in a hold, typically a bear hug or a headlock. A hold allows the opponent to control a Marine and removes the Marine’s ability to attack. It is important for Marines to extract themselves from chokes and holds, regain the tac- tical advantage, and counter with strikes. Although a choke causes unconsciousness in 8 to 13 seconds for a blood choke and 2 to 3 minutes for an air choke, the first movement in any counter to a choke is to clear the airway. Marines use softening techniques to loosen an opponent’s grip and to clear their airway. Softening tech- niques are particularly effective if Marines lack the physical strength of their opponent. These techniques include groin strikes, eye gouges, foot stomps, etc. Softening techniques are not offen- sive; rather, they are used to loosen an opponent’s hold. The second movement is to tuck the chin. Once the airway is clear, Marines tuck their chins to prevent the opponent from reapplying the choke.

In drawings, the Marine is depicted in woodland camouflage utili- ties; the opponent is depicted without camouflage. In photographs, the Marine is depicted in woodland camouflage utilities; the oppo- nent is depicted in desert camouflage utilities. Marines should avoid being on the ground during a close combat situation because the battlefield may be covered with debris and there is an in- creased risk of injury. However, many close com- bat situations involve fighting on the ground. The priority in a ground fight is for Marines to get back on their feet as quickly as possible. In any ground fighting scenario, Marines will usually end up in one of four positions with the opponent. The offensive positions, in which Marines have a tactical advantage, are the guard and mount. The defensive positions, which are used as counters when the opponent has the tactical advantage, are the counter to the guard and the counter to the mount. Marines can also employ chokes during ground fighting to quickly end a fight. 1. Offensive Ground Fighting Guard Position Marines execute a guard position when the oppo- nent is on top and the legs are wrapped around the opponent’s legs. If the opponent is on top, he may try to choke the Marine, but the Marine still has the tactical advantage because the Marine is in a position to control the situation.

Grasp and maintain control of the opponent’s left arm. Upon completion of the move, the Marine is sitting up with legs bent over the opponent while maintaining control of his arm. Keep legs and knees bent. Maintain pressure against the opponent’s neck with the back of the right foot and against his side with the left foot underneath his armpit. Squeeze the knees together, locking the op- ponent’s arm. Pull the opponent’s arm straight up and fall back sharply, pulling his arm to the side in the direction of his little finger. Return to standing. Mount Position Marines execute the mount if the opponent is ly- ing on his back on the ground and the Marine is on top with legs wrapped around the opponent’s body. This position is an offensive position be- cause Marines are in a better position to control the opponent and to execute ground fighting tech- niques.

The opponent has the tactical advantage. To execute the counter to the mount position, Marines— Grab the opponent’s gear or clothing on his upper torso and pull him down close. Use the right arm to hook the opponent’s left arm, from the inside around the outside, above his el- bow. With the right foot, hook the opponent’s left leg or ankle.

Ground Fighting Chokes WARNING During training, never execute a choke at full force or full speed. Never hold a choke for more than 5 seconds. The priority in ground fighting is for Marines to get back on their feet as quickly as possible. Sometimes, Marines can quickly end a ground fight by executing a choke on the opponent. When performed correctly, a choke can render an opponent unconscious in as little as 8 to 13 sec- onds. Chokes are easily performed regardless of size or gender. The chokes performed during ground fighting are the same as those performed while standing (see chap. 6). Ground Fighting Front Choke The ground fighting front choke is a blood choke performed most effectively from the mount posi- tion. The front choke employs the opponent’s la- pels or collar to execute the choke. To execute the ground fighting front choke, Marines— Grab the opponent’s right lapel with the right hand, making certain that the knuck- les or the back of the hand are against the carotid artery on the right side of the oppo- nent’s neck."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"7-6 _______________________________________________________________________________________________ MCRP 3-02B Keep the right hand pressed against the oppo- nent’s carotid artery, reach under the right arm with the left hand, and grab the opponent’s left la- pel, forming an X with the wrists.

Ground Fighting Side Choke The ground fighting side choke is a blood choke performed from the mount position. The ground fighting side choke is particularly effective when the opponent raises his arms and places them on the Marine’s chest or throat. To execute the ground fighting side choke, Marines— Use the left hand to parry the opponent’s right arm inboard (to the inside of the opponent’s reach). Bring the right arm underneath the oppo- nent’s arm and up around the front of his neck. Keep the fingers extended, place the back of the forearm against the opponent’s neck just below his ear and press the carotid artery on his neck.

To execute the ground fighting rear choke, Marines— Wrap the legs around the opponent with the left foot against the inside of his left thigh and the right foot against the inside of his right thigh. Use the right arm to reach over the opponent’s right shoulder and hook the bend of the arm around his neck. Use the left hand to clasp both hands together. Exert pressure with the biceps and forearms on both sides of the opponent’s neck. This applies pressure to the opponent’s carotid arteries.

The figure-four choke al- lows Marines to gain more leverage on the rear choke. If the rear choke cannot be secured, the figure-four variation may be applied to increase the pressure of the choke on the opponent. To ex- ecute the figure-four variation of the rear choke, Marines— Apply the ground fighting rear choke. The chest should be against the opponent’s back. Grasp the left biceps with the right hand and place the left hand against the back of the opponent’s head. Use the left hand to push the opponent’s head for- ward and down. Draw the right arm in while maintaining pressure with the biceps and forearm on both sides of the opponent’s neck.

However, all techniques can be executed from either side. In drawings, the Marine is depicted in woodland camouflage utili- ties; the opponent is depicted without camouflage. In photographs, the Marine is depicted in woodland camouflage utilities; the oppo- nent is depicted in desert camouflage utilities. The Marine Corps’ involvement in military oper- ations other than war—e.g., humanitarian, peace- keeping, or evacuation missions—has greatly increased. These missions require skills that span the spectrum of conflict and support operations within a continuum of force. But the Corps’ day- to-day existence also demands a responsible use of force. Nonlethal techniques are among the skills Marines use to apply a responsible use of force. 1. Unarmed Restraints and Manipulation Marines operate within a continuum of force, par- ticularly in support of peacekeeping or humanitar- ian types of missions. In these situations, Marines must act responsibly to handle a situation without resorting to deadly force. Unarmed restraints and manipulation techniques including joint manipu- lation, come-alongs, and takedowns can be used to control a subject without resorting to deadly force. Marines must train to become proficient in nonlethal techniques and to respond in a responsi- ble manner. These techniques are referred to as compliance techniques, and they are applied in the third level in the continuum of force. WARNING During training, never apply the techniques for unarmed restraints and manipulation at full force or full speed. Use a slow and steady pressure to avoid injury. Compliance Techniques Compliance techniques are unarmed restraint and manipulation techniques used to physically force a subject or opponent to comply. Compliance can be achieved through the close combat techniques of— l Pain compliance using joint manipulation and pressure points. (Pain compliance is the initiation of pain to get compliance on the part of the subject.) l Come-along holds. Principles of Joint Manipulation Joint manipulation is used to initiate pain compli- ance and gain control of a subject. It involves the application of pressure on the joints (elbow, wrist, shoulder, knee, ankle, and fingers). Pressure is ap- plied in two ways: l In the direction in which the joint will not bend. For example, joints such as the knees"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"8-2 _______________________________________________________________________________________________ MCRP 3-02B and elbows only bend in one direction and when pressure is applied in the opposite di- rection, pain compliance can be achieved. l Beyond the point where the joint stops natu- rally in its range of movement (i.e., it no longer bends). Since each joint has a breaking point, Marines should apply slow steady pressure only until pain compliance is reached. Continued pressure will break the joint and may escalate the violence of the situation. Joint manipulation also uses the principle of off- balancing. A subject can be better controlled when he is knocked off balance. Wristlocks A wristlock is a joint manipulation that can be ap- plied in a number of ways to achieve pain compli- ance. The wrist rotates in a number of directions and will bend in a single direction until its move- ment stops naturally. In a wristlock, pressure is exerted beyond that point by bending or twisting the joint. A wristlock is executed when an oppo- nent tries to grab Marines or is successful in grab- bing Marines or their equipment. A wristlock can also be performed by Marines if they wish to ini- tiate control of an opponent. Basic Wristlock. A basic wristlock is executed when Marines grab the opponent’s left hand with the right hand. To execute the basic wristlock, Marines— Use the right hand to grab the opponent’s left hand by placing the thumb on the back of the op- ponent’s hand so that the Marine’s knuckles are facing to the left. Hook the fingers across the fleshy part of the oppo- nent’s palm below the thumb. The fingers are used to anchor the hand so leverage can be applied to twist and bend the joint. Exert downward pressure with the thumb to bend the opponent’s joint. Rotate the opponent’s hand to the right to twist the joint. Step in to the opponent to keep the opponent’s hand in close to the body to control him and provide more lever- age on the wristlock. Note: When executing the ba- sic wristlock with the left hand, the Marine grabs the opponent’s hand so that the Marine’s knuckles are facing to the right, and then rotates and twists the opponent’s hand to the left. Reverse Wristlock. A reverse wristlock is exe- cuted when Marines grab the opponent’s right hand with the right hand. To execute the reverse wristlock, Marines— Place the right palm on the back of the opponent’s right hand and wrap the fingers across the fleshy part of his palm below his little finger. Twist the opponent’s hand to the right while step- ping in to place his hand against the chest. Apply downward pressure on the opponent’s hand against the chest. Leave the opponent’s hand on the chest to fully control the subject and to gain leverage. Use the left hand to further control the opponent."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Close Combat _____________________________________________________________________________________________ 8-3 Lean forward to use body weight to add addition- al pressure to the joint. Two-Handed Wristlock. Both hands can be used in the wristlock to maximize the leverage and pressure needed to bend and twist the joint. To ex- ecute the two-handed wristlock, Marines— Place both thumbs on the back of the opponent’s hand, thumbs crossed. Hook the fingers of both hands around the fleshy part of the opponent’s palm on both sides of his hand. Step into the opponent and apply pressure down- ward on the back of his hand to bend the joint and rotate his wrist away from the body to twist the joint. Enhanced Pain Compliance on Wristlock. En- hanced pain compliance techniques are applied in the third and fourth levels in the continuum of force. Additional pain be applied to a wristlock by— Adding downward pressure to the elbow with the other hand or elbow by using the fingers to pull in on the opponent’s radial nerve located on the in- side of the forearm. When pressure is added to the opponent’s radial nerve, his direction can be con- trolled. Applying pressure against the opponent’s finger joint to bend it in a direction it cannot bend (i.e., splitting the fingers). Come-Along Holds Marines use a come-along hold to control and move an opponent. Escort Position. A common come-along hold is the escort position. To execute the escort position, Marines— Face the opponent. Use the left foot to step forward at a 45-de- gree angle. Turn to face the right side of the opponent. Use the left hand to further control the opponent."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"8-4 _______________________________________________________________________________________________ MCRP 3-02B Use the right hand to firmly grasp the opponent’s right wrist. With the left hand, firmly grasp the opponent’s right triceps. Position the opponent’s controlled arm diagonally across the torso, keeping his wrist against the right hip. The Marine should be standing to the right of and behind the opponent. Note: This technique works well when escorting an opponent on either the right or left side. Take caution when escorting an opponent by ensuring his controlled hand is not in a position to grab the holstered weapon. The preferred escort position is from the Marine’s left side, so that the opponent is kept further away from the weapon. Wristlock Come-Along. To execute the wristlock come-along, Marines— Use the left hand to execute a basic wristlock. In- corporate the right hand in a two-handed wristlock for more control. Maintain pressure on the op- ponent’s wrist with the right hand, step forward, and pivot around to stand next to the opponent. Release the left hand, quickly reach under the opponent’s arm from be- hind, and grab his hand."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Close Combat _____________________________________________________________________________________________ 8-5 Use the left hand and ap- ply downward pressure on the opponent’s wrist. Controlling Technique. The following control- ling technique is used when an opponent grabs the Marine’s wrist. To execute the technique, Marines— Trap the opponent’s hand with the palm of the other hand. Rotate the opponent’s trapped hand up and on his forearm while maintaining downward pressure on his trapped hand. Apply downward pressure with both hands until the opponent is taken to the ground. Armbars An armbar is a joint manipulation in which pres- sure is applied on a locked elbow, just above the joint, in the direction the joint will not bend. An armbar has to be locked in quickly, but still re- quires a slow, steady pressure to gain compliance. Basic Armbar.

To gain additional leverage, pivot to face the opponent. Use the left hand to apply downward pressure on or above the opponent’s elbow joint while pulling up on his wrist. Armbar from a Wristlock. To execute an armbar from a wristlock, Marines— Use the right hand to grab the opponent’s right hand and execute a reverse wristlock. Bring the left hand down on or above the oppo- nent’s elbow joint. Use the left hand to apply downward pressure on or above the opponent’s elbow joint while pulling up on his wrist. Takedowns A takedown is used to bring an opponent to the ground to further control him. Takedown From a Wristlock Come-Along. To take the oppo- nent to the ground from a wristlock come-along, Marines— Use the right foot to push down on the opponent’s calf or Achilles tendon. Maintain control of the oppo- nent’s wrist and elbow and apply a slow, steady pressure to bring him to the ground."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Close Combat _____________________________________________________________________________________________ 8-7 Armbar to a Takedown. This technique is used to take a noncompliant opponent to the ground from an armbar. To execute the armbar takedown, Marines— Use the right hand to execute a reverse wristlock.

Pivot so the back is facing the opponent and, at the same time, lift the left elbow and slide the body so it is against the oppo- nent, placing the armpit high above the opponent’s elbow joint. Lean back, placing the body weight on the oppo- nent’s arm until he complies or is taken to the ground. Note: This technique may break the opponent’s arm. Therefore, this technique should not be em- ployed if the objective is a nonlethal takedown. Wristlock Takedown. This technique is used to take a noncompliant opponent to the ground from a basic wristlock and to put him in a position where he can be handcuffed, if necessary.

To execute the escort position takedown, Marines— Lock the opponent’s arm straight across the body while rotating his wrist away from the body. Use the left hand or forearm and apply downward pressure above the opponent’s elbow where the triceps meet. Step back with the right foot and, keeping the op- ponent’s hand controlled against the hip, pivot to the right while continuing to apply downward pressure on his arm to bring him to the ground. Note: This technique works well when escorting a subject on the Marine’s right or left side. When taking down a subject from the right side, step back and pivot to the left. 2. Nonlethal Baton A baton or nightstick can be an effective compli- ance tool when used correctly. Batons can be used defensively (blocking), offensively (striking), and as a restraining device when needed. In the fourth level of the continuum of force (assaultive [bodily harm]), defensive tactics include baton or night- stick blocks and blows. Blows to the head or other bony parts of the body are considered deadly force. When deadly force is not authorized, Marines must be able to employ blocks, strikes, and restraints with the baton with the minimum of force. Grips One-Handed Grip. To execute the one-handed grip, Marines— Use the right hand to grasp the lower end of the baton, about 2 inches from the end. Wrap the thumb and index finger around the baton so they are touching one another. The grip on the baton should be firm, but natu- ral."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"8-10 ______________________________________________________________________________________________ MCRP 3-02B Two-Handed Grip. To execute the two-handed grip, Marines— Use the right hand to grasp the lower end of the baton, about 2 inches from the end. Wrap the thumb and index finger around the baton so they touch one an- other. Use the left hand to grasp the upper end of the baton, palm down, about 2 inches from the end. The hands should be ap- proximately 10 to 12 inches apart. Stance and Method of Carry The basic warrior stance serves as the foundation for initiating nonlethal baton techniques. The method of carry provides effective defensive posi- tions with a wide range of options to control a combative opponent. One-Handed Carry. To execute the one-handed carry, Marines— Grip the baton using the one-handed grip. Elevate the baton, with the gripping hand at a lev- el between the belt and shoulder. Keep the left hand in the position of the basic warrior stance. Two-Handed Carry. This carry is effective for blocks. To execute the two-handed carry, Marines— Grip the baton using the two-handed grip. Elevate the baton, with the left hand higher than the right hand. Orient the weapon toward the subject. Movement In a nonlethal confrontation, movement may be made to create distance between Marines and the opponent or to close the gap to control him. When facing an opponent, Marines move in a 45-degree angle to either side of the opponent. Moving at a 45-degree angle is the best way to both avoid an opponent’s strike and to put Marines in the best position to control the opponent. Blocking Techniques One-handed blocks are used when carrying the baton in the one-handed carry. The same one- handed blocks used in combative stick techniques (see page 3-6) apply in nonlethal baton engage- ments. The blocks include blocks for a vertical strike, a forward strike, and a reverse strike. Be- cause the baton is often carried with two hands, there are also two-handed blocks that are effec- tively used from this carry. Two-handed blocks are discussed in the following subparagraphs."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Close Combat ___________________________________________________________________________________________ 8-11 High Block. Marines execute a high block to de- ter a downward vertical attack directed at the head and shoulders. To execute the high block, Marines— Raise the baton up to a level even with or above the head. The baton should be in a horizontal po- sition to block the blow. The fingers of the left hand should be open and behind the baton. Place the baton perpendicular to the opponent’s striking surface to absorb the impact of the blow. Bend the elbows slightly to help absorb the im- pact of the blow. The arms should give with the strike of the blow. Low Block. Marines execute a low block to deter an upward vertical attack directed at the abdomen, groin, or torso. The opponent’s blow can be deliv- ered by a foot, knee, or fist. To execute the low block, Marines— Lower the baton to a level even with or below the groin. The baton should be in a horizontal posi- tion to block the blow. The fingers of the left hand should be open and behind the baton. Place the baton perpendicular to the opponent’s striking surface to absorb the impact of the blow. Bend the elbows slightly to help absorb the im- pact of the blow. The arms should give with the strike of the blow. Right Block. Marines execute a right block to de- ter an attack directed at the head, neck, flank, or hip. The opponent’s blow can be delivered by a foot, knee, fist, or elbow. To execute the right block, Marines— Thrust the baton in a vertical position to the right side. Pivot to the right by stepping with the left foot and pivoting off the ball of the right foot. Rotate the hips and shoulders into the direction of the block. The fingers of the left hand should be open and behind the baton."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"8-12 ______________________________________________________________________________________________ MCRP 3-02B Place the baton perpendicular to the opponent’s striking surface to absorb the impact of the blow.

To execute the strong-side armlock, Marines— Use the right hand to run the baton up under the opponent’s left armpit, parallel to the ground. Use the right foot to step forward at a 45-degree angle to the left side of the opponent. The baton is across his forearm. Use the right hand to drive the baton forward and up so the action bends the opponent’s arm behind his back. At the same time, continue moving around him to get behind him. Place the baton on the opponent’s forearm with the thumb and/or fingers and apply pressure to his forearm. At the same time, grasp the other end of the baton with the left hand. Pull up on the low end of the baton with the right hand. At the same time, push down on the top end of the baton with the left forearm, reaching around with the left hand to grasp the opponent’s biceps or shoulder."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"8-14 ______________________________________________________________________________________________ MCRP 3-02B Continue exerting downward pressure with the left forearm while pulling back on the opponent’s biceps with the left hand. This places the oppo- nent in a position where he is controlled and can be moved. Apply pressure with the foot against the bend in the opponent’s leg above his calf. This lowers the opponent to the ground rather than throwing him to the ground and risking severe injury. Striking Target Areas Marines must avoid striking an opponent in the head, neck, or other bony parts with the baton be- cause this is considered deadly force and can lead to serious bodily injury or death. Instead, the legs, arms, and buttocks are target areas that are con- sidered nonlethal. Legs. Primary targets are the thighs and lower legs. Avoid striking the knee and ankle joints be- cause this can cause permanent damage. Arms. Primary targets are the upper arms. Avoid striking the shoulder and elbow and wrist joints because this can cause permanent damage. Buttocks. Primary targets are the buttocks. Avoid striking any other part of the torso, including the chest, rib cage, spine, tail bone, and groin because strikes to these areas can cause permanent dam- age or death. One-Handed Striking Techniques One-Handed Forward Strike. A forward strike follows either a horizontal line or a downward di- agonal line using a forehand stroke. To execute the one-handed forward strike, Marines— Stand facing the opponent with the baton carried in a one-handed carry. Place the right hand palm up, swing the baton from right to left, and make contact with the op- ponent. One-Handed Reverse Strike. A reverse strike follows either a horizontal line or a downward di- agonal line using a backhand stroke.

Pugil stick training builds on the techniques used to throw punches. Pugil stick training is the only “full contact” training provid- ed to Marines in the Close Combat Program. Pu- gil stick training teaches Marines to function when faced with stress and violence, and it pre- pares them to deliver a blow and take a blow. It also provides them with the physical and mental skills vital to success on the battlefield. 1. Pugil Stick Training Design A pugil stick consists of a stick wrapped in pad- ding at both ends that can be gripped like a rifle. The pugil stick is approximately the same weight and length of an unloaded rifle with a bayonet at- tached. Holding the Pugil Stick The pugil stick is held in the same manner as the service rifle. All movements come from the basic warrior stance. To hold the pugil stick correctly, Marines— l Use the right hand to grasp the lower end of the pugil stick overhanded. l Use the left hand to grasp the upper end of the pugil stick underhanded. l Use the right forearm to lock the lower end of the pugil stick against the hip. l Orient the blade end of the pugil stick to- ward the opponent. Safety Equipment The following safety equipment must be worn during any pugil stick bout. Groin Protection. Groin protection protects the groin from an accidental blow. It should be pulled high around the waist to protect the groin area, with the concave portion against the body. Flak Jacket. The flak jacket provides protection to the body. It is worn completely fastened. Neck Roll. The neck roll prevents whiplash if Marines receive a blow to the head. The neck roll further supports the head and protects the neck from blows. The neck roll is worn above the flak jacket and below the helmet. The tied end of the neck roll faces the front. Helmet. A regulation football helmet protects the face and head. The helmet must fit snugly and the chin straps must be adjusted and snapped. Mouthpiece. The mouthpiece is worn on the up- per teeth to protect the teeth. Gloves. Marines wear gloves to protect the hands if pugil sticks do not have gloves built-in."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"A-2 _______________________________________________________________________________________________ MCRP 3-02B Pugil Stick Screening Prior to pugil stick training, instructors must ask participating Marines the following questions. If a Marine answers “yes” to any question, he must see the corpsman or a competent medical authori- ty who evaluates him and determines whether or not the he can participate in the training. l Are you on light duty? l Are you restricted to running shoes by a corpsman or a doctor? l Have you fought in a pugil stick bout within the last 7 days? l Have you received a blow to the head within the last 7 days? l Have you had a concussion within the last 6 months? l Have you had dental surgery within the last 24 hours? l Do you have stitches or staples on your body? l Have you had a shoulder or head injury within the last 5 years? l Are you taking a prescription drug? l Do you have an ear infection or current si- nus infection? l Have you had a broken bone within the last 6 months? Safety Personnel The following safety personnel are required to conduct pugil stick training: l One close combat instructor must officiate the bout. l One close combat instructor trainer, com- missioned officer, or staff noncommissioned officer must be in the training area to serve as range safety officer. l One corpsman must be in the training area. Training Area To prevent injury, Marines train on areas with soft footing (i.e., sand or grass). Training mats are not recommended because feet can stick to the mats, prohibiting movement or causing joint injuries by twisting a knee. Bouts should not take place on a hard surface area; e.g., a flight deck or parking lot. A boxing ring may be used to conduct pugil stick bouts; ring dimensions can vary as long as there is ample room to execute the techniques in the training area. Second Impact Syndrome Second Impact Syndrome occurs when a second blow to the head produces a second concussion that occurs within 1 week following a previous concussion (before recovery from the first con- cussion). Second Impact Syndrome causes rapid brain swelling and can cause death. Therefore, there must be 7 days between pugil stick bouts to reduce the risk of severe injury resulting from Second Impact Syndrome. The 7 day separation between pugil stick bouts significantly reduces the possibility of injury, particularly in someone who may have suffered a brain injury or concus- sion but shows no symptoms. Any Marine who experiences headaches or the following symptoms after training must be exam- ined by appropriate medical personnel: l Blurred vision. l Ringing in the ears. l Dilation of the pupils. l Slurred speech. l Bleeding from ears or mouth. l Swelling in head or neck area. l Any unnatural discoloration in head or neck area. The Marine should not be allowed to participate in pugil stick training or any other activity where a heavy blow might be sustained for a minimum of 7 days after the headache or other symptoms have subsided. Safety Measures The following safety measures must be followed: l Gear must be worn properly throughout training. l Contact lenses or glasses will not be worn. l False teeth will be removed from the mouth. l Nothing will be worn around the neck ex- cept the neck roll."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Close Combat ____________________________________________________________________________________________ A-3 l Competition among groups of Marines is authorized as long as it does not overshadow training objectives or compromise safety procedures. l Safety and proper techniques are paramount. l Safety is more important than competition. 2. General Rules and Regulations Governing Pugil Stick Bouts Instructors and Support Personnel Requirements At a minimum, one close combat instructor ob- serves a pugil stick bout. For safety purposes, it is better to have two instructors judging a bout be- cause each instructor can fully observe each of the fighters. The best position for observation is to the right of a fighter. This allows the instructor to see the fighter’s facial expression and body move- ment. The instructor’s position must not interfere with the fight. In addition, one commissioned or staff noncom- missioned officer (to serve as range safety officer) and one corpsman will be in the training area. Prior to the Bout Prior to the bout, Marines— l Are paired according to height, weight, and gender. l Wear the proper safety equipment. Once Marines have properly donned the safety equipment, they wait for instructions from the close combat instructor. On the command of the close combat instructor, a pair of Marines will en- ter the ring. Once in the ring, the close combat in- structor inspects each Marine for the proper safety equipment. Note: There should be enough gear so that when two Marines are training, two other Marines can be donning safety equipment for the next bout. During the Bout The bout begins when the close combat instructor blows the whistle. All strikes are directed above the waist. Upon hearing a whistle blast, all fight- ing immediately ceases. Stopping a Bout There are two reasons for stopping a bout: deliv- ery of a scoring blow or an unsafe condition. The close combat instructor trainer, close combat in- structor, or the range safety officer may stop the bout at any time an unsafe condition is observed. Scoring Blow. A scoring blow is an offensive technique delivered to a vulnerable area of an op- ponent with sufficient force and precision to be considered as a disabling or killing blow. Scoring blows are not judged solely on the degree of force with which a blow is delivered, but on the accura- cy and techniques employed. A scoring blow is defined as— l A straight thrust with the blade end of the weapon (red end of the pugil stick) to the opponent’s face mask or throat. l A slash to the side of the opponent’s helmet (below the ear) or neck with the red end of the pugil stick. l A heavy blow to the opponent’s head with an authorized technique (i.e., buttstroke, smash) using the butt (black end) of the pu- gil stick. When a scoring blow is delivered, the close com- bat instructor blows the whistle to stop the bout. Unsafe Condition. The bout will be stopped as soon as an unsafe condition exists. An unsafe con- dition exists when a Marine is unable to defend himself, loses his balance and falls down on one or two knees or falls down completely, shows in- stability (e.g., buckling at the knees), loses mus- cular tension in his neck and his head snaps back or to one side, or appears disoriented. An unsafe"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"A-4 _______________________________________________________________________________________________ MCRP 3-02B condition also exists if a Marine lets go of one end of the pugil stick, the equipment (e.g., helmet, neck roll) falls off, or a Marine fails to use the proper techniques. If any of these conditions occur— l The close combat instructor trainer, close combat instructor, range safety officer, or anyone supervising training stops the bout and separates the two Marines. l The corpsman evaluates the possibly injured Marine to determine if the fight can contin- ue. The corpsman— n Ensures that he is alert and responsive, both verbally and physically. n Talks to him to see if he is coherent. n Makes certain he comprehends and re- plies to verbal questions. n Makes certain his speech is not slurred. n Checks his physical signs. n Ensures his eyes are focused and not dazed or glazed. n Ensures his legs are not wobbly or shaky. The pugil stick is not used as a baseball bat. The use of unauthorized techniques will result in ex- pulsion from the bout. Only techniques taught in bayonet training are authorized. These techniques include— l Straight thrust. l Buttstroke (horizontal and vertical). l Smash. l Slash. l Parry. l Blocks (low, high, left, right). After the Bout A third whistle blast is used prior to identifying the Marine who delivered the killing blow. A fourth whistle blast is used prior to demonstrat- ing the killing technique used by the Marine who won the bout. 3. Directions for Making Pugil Sticks Close combat instructor trainers are taught to make pugil sticks to standard specifications at school. It is recommended that all pugil sticks be made under the supervision of a close combat in- structor trainer. Until the Marine Corps acquires a standardized pugil stick that units can order through the supply system, instructors use the fol- lowing information and instructions to make pugil sticks locally. Supplies The following supplies are needed to make one pugil stick: l One 45\" by 2\" circular, oak, wood dowel. l Four 9\" wide by 27\" long foam pad pieces to make two inner handguards of double thick- ness. l Four 11\" wide by 19\" long foam pad pieces to make two outer handguards of double thickness. l Canvas material to cover inner and outer handguards. l One foam pad cut 1/4\" thick by 7\" wide by 13\" long to make the centerguard. l One 8\" wide by 14\"long piece of canvas material to make a pugil stick sock. l Canvas material to make two pugil stick end caps. Ideally, two different color fabrics should be used to simulate the bayonet and buttstock ends of a rifle. Common colors for end caps are black and red. Each end cap is a different color to help the officiating certi- fied close combat instructor determine the scoring blow during the pugil stick bout. l Two 1/4\" thick by 11\" wide by 54\" long foam pad pieces to make two ends. l Two foam pads cut 1/4\" thick by 3\" wide by 14 1/2\" long to make two end plug inserts. l One can of 3M Photo Mount  spray adhe- sive (NSN 8040-01-120-4009)to adhere foam padding to the stick. (Spray adhesive is available from self-service.) l One roll of duct tape or riggers tape (NSN 7510-00-266-5016) to protect foam pad and"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Close Combat ____________________________________________________________________________________________ A-5 canvas from wear and to reinforce gluing action of spray adhesive. (Duct tape or rig- gers tape is available from self-service.) l One roll para-cord or 5-50 cord to tie both the inner and outer handguards together. l One roll of thread strong enough to sew can- vas material together. l Sixteen grommets, one for each of the four corners of the inner and outer handguards. l One foam sleeping mat (NSN 8465-01-109- 3369). Use unserviceable foam sleeping mats obtained from Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office. Tools The following tools are needed to make a pugil stick: l Tape measure, ruler, or yardstick. l Scissors. l Grommet machine. l Knife. l Sewing machine. Directions To make a pugil stick, Marines perform the fol- lowing steps. Preparing Materials Step 1. Cut foam sleeping mat into the dimensions listed above. Cut mats to double thickness. Step 2. Use spray adhesive to adhere the two 9\" by 27\" pieces of foam together. Use the spray ad- hesive to adhere the two 11\" by 19\" pieces of foam together. Let adhesive dry before using the double-thick foam for handguards. Step 3. Cut canvas material to make two cover- ings for the inner handguards. Cut material to make two coverings for the outer handguards. Two inner handguards and two outer handguards are required for each pugil stick. Step 4. Use a sewing machine to make a sleeve out of the 9\" by 27\" canvas. Sew down three sides. Insert foam pad inside the canvas sleeve and then sew down the fourth side. Use the grom- met machine to create holes reinforced with metal grommets in each of the four corners. Once fin- ished, the inner handguards are complete. Note: It is recommended that the Fabric Repair Shop be used to sew canvas sleeves and apply grommets. Step 5. Repeat step 4 to make the other inner handguard and both outer handguards. INNER FOAM PAD SPRAY ADHESIVE OUTER HANDGUARD INNER HANDGUARD INNER FOAM PAD"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"A-6 _______________________________________________________________________________________________ MCRP 3-02B Constructing Ends, End Plugs, and End Caps Step 1. Apply spray adhesive on approximately 8 inches of one end of the dowel. This adhesive serves to glue the foam pad to the wooden dowel. Step 2. Apply spray adhesive on one side of the 11\" by 54\" foam pad. This causes the foam pad to stick to itself when it is rolled around the end of the wooden dowel. Ensure 3 inches of the rolled foam pad extends past the wooden dowel for sta- bility. Step 3. Apply spray adhe- sive on one side of 3\" by 14 1/2\" foam pad. Roll pad in- to a tight cylinder. Step 4. Apply spray adhesive on the exposed end of the dowel and fill the hole in the end with the end plug. The end plug prevents the wooden dow- el from protruding beyond the edge of the rolled foam padding. This is an important safety precau- tion to prevent injury. Step 5. Use duct tape or riggers tape to secure and reinforce the foam pad once the end plug is insert- ed in the end. Step 6. Measure the dimensions of the ends (typi- cally, the length of the cylinder should be 12 inch- es long to allow for taping). Cut and sew canvas material in the shape of a cylinder with one open end. Once complete, this becomes the end cap. The end cap is a colored sleeve that covers the rolled and taped foam pad at each end of the pugil stick. Note: It is recommended that the Fabric Repair Shop be used to make the end cap. Step 7. Slide one of the end caps over the rolled foam pad and tape it to the dowel. Building the Centerguard Step 1. Spray one side of the 7\" by 13\" foam pad with spray adhesive and wrap it tightly around the center of the dowel.

Wrap duct tape or riggers tape around the foam pad to secure. Step 3. Use a sewing machine to make a tubular pugil stick sock out of the 8\" by 14\" piece of can- vas. Slide the pugil stick sock over the rolled foam pad and secure it with the duct tape or rig- gers tape. Duct tape or riggers tape protects the edges of the centerguard and reinforces the gluing effects of the spray adhesive. Note: It is recommended that the Fabric Repair Shop be used to make the pugil stick sock. Finishing the Opposite End Cap After one end cap is complete and the centerguard is finished, then repeat steps 1 through 7 in Con- structing Ends, End Plugs, and End Caps for the other end of the pugil stick. Ensure that the oppo- site color end cap is used. Fastening Handguards Step 1. Place the inner handguards (longer piece) around the dowel. The inner handguard is placed on first because it protects the wrist. One inner handguard is needed for the left hand and one for the right hand. Step 2. Fold the inner handguard around the pugil stick and run the para-cord or 5-50 cord through the metal grommets. Step 3. Tighten down the corner ends of the inner handguards by pulling on the para-cord or 5-50 cord. Step 4. Tie off the cord with a square knot above the metal grommets. Step 5. Place the outer handguards (shorter piece) over the inner handguards (longer piece). Repeat steps 1-4 for the other handguard. The outer hand- guards provide additional protection to the knuck- les and fingers and provides additional stability for the inner handguards. Serviceability Inspection Prior to any training, all pugil sticks are inspected to ensure they are fit for use. If any of the follow- ing conditions exist, the pugil stick is unsafe and will not be used: l Stick protrudes through the end caps. l Frayed or worn edges exist on canvas sur- faces. l The stick can be felt through the pads or the padding is too soft. l End caps or handguards are not securely at- tached. FOAM TAPE CANVAS TAPE (reverse blank)"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"APPENDIX B SAFETY PRECAUTIONS DURING TRAINING 1. General Safety Precautions When training close combat techniques, certain safety precautions must be adhered to to prevent injuries. Most training should be conducted on a training area with soft footing such as a sandy or grassy area. If training mats are available, they should be used. A hard surface area is not appropriate for close combat training. All techniques should be executed slowly at first. Marines can increase the speed of execution as they become more proficient. Marine-on-Marine training that requires contact (chokes, throws, ground fighting, and unarmed restraints and ma- nipulation) should not be executed at full force or full speed. If a technique is applied to the point that a Marine is uncomfortable, the Marine must “tap out.” This indicates immediate release of the pressure being applied or to immediately stop the technique. The Marine “taps out” by firmly tapping his hand sev- eral times on any part of the opponent’s body that will get his attention or by saying stop . Second Impact Syndrome occurs when a second concussion develops within hours, days, or weeks following a prior concussion (and before recovery from the first concussion). Second Impact Syn- drome causes rapid brain swelling and can cause death. Marines who experience headaches or oth- er symptoms following training must be exam- ined by appropriate medical personnel. These symptoms can include, but are not limited to, blurred vision, ringing in the ears, dialation of the pupils, bleeding from the ears or mouth, slurred speech, swelling in head or neck area, or any un- natural discoloration of head or neck. They should not be allowed to participate in pugil stick train- ing or any other activity where a heavy blow might be sustained for a minimum of 7 days after the symptoms have subsided. 2. Safety Precautions for Individual Techniques Falls When training Marines to fall, they should progress from the ground, to a kneeling or squat- ting position, and then to a standing position. This ensures they are comfortable and understand the technique before progressing to executing falls from a higher profile. This instructional technique vastly reduces the risk of injury. Strikes and Punches When training Marines to strike and punch, they begin by executing the techniques \"in the air.\" As they become more proficient, they execute strikes on equipment (when available) such as an air shield or a heavy bag. At no time should they be permitted to execute strikes on another student. Chokes and Ground Fighting Chokes When training Marines to execute chokes, they will not apply pressure to the opponent’s throat during training because the trachea and windpipe can be crushed. During training, Marines should practice the proper procedures for blood chokes. They should never execute air chokes. At no time during training should a choke be applied at full"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"B-2 _______________________________________________________________________________________________ MCRP 3-02B force or full speed. No choke should be held for longer than 5 seconds. Unarmed Restraints and Manipulation When training Marines to execute unarmed re- straints and manipulation techniques, they utilize slow and steady pressure. Never apply these tech- niques at full force or at full speed. Pugil Stick Training A blow to the head during training will bruise the brain. A second blow to the head can cause death. This is known as the Second Impact Syndrome. There must be 7 days between pugil stick training to prevent injury or death."}]
