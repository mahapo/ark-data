They were eventually published in 1960 asMountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills, a comprehensive mountain climbing bookcontaining information on equipment, navigation, wilderness travel, andtechnical details of climbing on rock, snow, and glaciers. It has been revisedseven times since its initial publication, and we have contributed to the lastfive revisions.In addition to writing about navigation, we have hiked, scrambled, snowshoed,and climbed extensively, as well as taught navigation in courses sponsored byThe Mountaineers and Green Trails Maps. In some of the nonclimbing classes, wehave often been asked to recommend a book covering the material presented in ourcourses and lectures. However, the only book using the same methods and coveringthe same material as these courses was Freedom. Some skiers, snowshoers, andhikers balked at buying a large, expensive book filled with details of technicalrock and ice climbing just to obtain information on navigation; it was out ofthis need that the idea for Wilderness Navigation emerged.This book was originally envisioned as a small, affordable book containing thesame information covered in the navigation chapter of Freedom. However, a lot ofuseful information had been excluded from Freedom in order to keep its sizemanageable. Wilderness Navigation was therefore expanded, with the addition ofconsiderable technical information as well as material on wildernessroutefinding. This book now provides more than twice as much material as thenavigation chapter in Freedom.The methods of using maps and compasses in this book have been taught for manyyears by The Mountaineers. When using the methods explained in this book,orienting the map is not necessary, nor is it necessary to add or subtractdeclination, nor to draw declination lines on your maps. Instead, we encouragethe use of compasses with adjustable declination and explain how to make allcompasses work like such compasses. This has proven to be an easy and dependablemethod of dealing with declination.Since the publication of the second edition in 2004, we have received fromreaders a number of suggestions for improvement. We have incorporated many ofthese into this third edition, including an update to the descriptions ofpresently available maps, compasses, altimeters, and Global Positioning System(GPS) receivers, as well as updated declination maps for the United States andthe world. Since 2004 there have also been some important changes to the GPS,requiring updates to that chapter, including the interfacing of the GPS receiverwith the home computer, as well as using the GPS function in smart phones. Wehave also added more information on navigational techniques, as well as websitesand other sources containing useful navigational information. Some of thisinformation came about when researching GPS usage for our other book, WildernessGPS (Mountaineers Books, 2013), and is included herein, although in a severelyabridged form."},{"pageContent":"AcknowledgmentsWe wish to express our appreciation to a number of individuals who havecontributed to this book.

How far is it to my destination? Will I be able to find my way back?This book shows you how to use orientation and navigation to answer these mostfrequently asked questions in wilderness travel.By the time you finish reading this guide, you will have a good handle on thetools of navigation and the proven techniques of top-notch navigators, who haveacquired their skills through years of roaming—and being lost in—the wilderness.You will have the basic knowledge to head into the wilds, work out the way toyour destination, and, most importantly, find your way home.The tools and techniques are simple and straightforward—but exacting. Study themcarefully to help make your wilderness adventures successful and to keep yousafe and within the ranks of surviving navigators. Before you immerse yourselfin this book, remember navigation is easy and fun. (So much fun, in fact, thatsome people engage in orienteering, in which participants compete using a mapand compass to get to various destinations on structured courses.) First, a fewdefinitions:Orientation is the science of determining your exact position on Earth. Peoplewho spend a reasonable amount of time and effort usually gain these skills, evenif they have little background or interest in math or science.Navigation is the science of determining the location of your objective andkeeping yourself pointed in the right direction from your starting point to thisdestination. Like orientation, navigation is a required skill for all wildernesstravelers.Routefinding is the art of selecting and following the best path appropriate forthe abilities and equipment of the party. It takes a lot to be a goodroutefinder: an integrated sense of terrain, as well as a combination of goodjudgment, experience, acute awareness, and instinct. In addition to a solidfoundation in the orientation and navigation skills described in the followingchapters, wilderness routefinding also requires considerable time, practice, andexperience.The route through this book is divided into two parts. The first, consisting ofchapters 1 [part0008.html#7K4G0-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5] through 5[part0012.html#BE6O0-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5], contains basicinformation on maps, compasses, orientation, navigation, how to avoid gettinglost, and what to do if you do get lost. These chapters contain the basicessentials of wilderness navigation for all wilderness travelers, includingthose who never intend to leave a well-maintained trail.Chapters 6 [part0013.html#CCNA0-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5] through 10[part0017.html#G6PI0-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5] provide more detailedinformation on wilderness navigation: the latitude/longitude and UTM coordinatesystems; distance measurement and pace; the use of clinometers, altimeters, GPSreceivers, and smart devices; and wilderness routefinding on trails, in theforest, desert, in alpine areas, and on snow and glaciers. We recommend acareful reading of these chapters for anyone who intends to leave the trail andventure cross-country in search of hidden fishing lakes, challenging mountainpeaks, interesting cross-country ski routes, and other destinations beyond thewell-maintained trail.If you do not own a compass, we suggest that you read at least through chapter 2[part0009.html#8IL20-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5] before buying one.We also highly recommend that you complete the practice problems in the appendix[part0019_split_000.html#I3QM0-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5] as you navigatethrough this book.This book will not make you an expert in wilderness navigation; only practiceand experience will do so. But it can give you a basic foundation in the skillsnecessary for safe and enjoyable wilderness travel.A NOTE ABOUT SAFETYSafety is an important concern in all outdoor activities. No book can alert youto every hazard or anticipate the limitations of every reader. The descriptionsof techniques and procedures in this book are intended to provide generalinformation. This is not a complete text on wilderness travel. Nothingsubstitutes for formal instruction, routine practice, and plenty of experience.When you follow any of the procedures described here, you assume responsibilityfor your own safety. Use this book as a general guide to further information.Under normal conditions, excursions into the backcountry require attention totraffic, road and trail conditions, weather, terrain, the capabilities of yourparty, and other factors. Keeping informed on current conditions and exercisingcommon sense are the keys to a safe, enjoyable outing.—Mountaineers Books"},{"pageContent":"Chapter1Map BasicsCHAPTER OBJECTIVES•Learn basic map terminology.•Understand how to read topographic maps, including declination, north–southreference lines, colors, contour lines, and slope direction.•Discover the limitations of maps.•Customize and prepare maps for wilderness trips.•Find out where to get maps.A map is a symbolic picture of a place. In convenient shorthand, it conveys aphenomenal amount of information in a form that is easy to understand and easyto carry. For water activities, navigational charts provide the same level ofinformation as topographic maps do on land, but with particular attention tonavigational hazards. No one should venture into the wilderness without a map orchart of the area, or without the skills required to interpret and thoroughlyunderstand it.You can find a lot of useful information on a map. For wilderness land travel,the most important items are topographic features, vegetation, and elevationinformation, which are discussed in this chapter. (See chapter 6[part0013.html#CCNA0-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5] for more in-depthinformation, such as the use of the latitude/longitude and UTM coordinatesystems, distance and slope measurement, and surveying information.) Note thepublication date of the map and obtain the latest information, because roads,trails, and other features may have changed since the map was printed.UNDERSTANDING MAP TYPES AND TERMSIt will be helpful to start this discussion of maps with a description of howcartographers divide up Earth. The distance around our planet is divided into360 units called degrees (designated with a ° symbol). A measurement east orwest is called longitude. Longitude is measured from 0° to 180°, both east andwest, starting at the Greenwich meridian running through the Royal Observatory,Greenwich, near London, England. A measurement north or south is calledlatitude. Latitude is measured from 0° to 90°, north and south, from theequator. New York City, for example, is situated at about 74 degrees westlongitude and 41 degrees north latitude (74° W and 41° N). Each degree isdivided into 60 units called minutes (designated with a ' symbol), and eachminute is further subdivided into 60 seconds (designated with a \" symbol). On amap, a latitude of 46 degrees, 53 minutes, and 15 seconds north would be writtenlike this: N46°53'15\". Alternatively, this can be written as 46 degrees, 53.25minutes, or 46.8875 degrees (more about this in chapter 6[part0013.html#CCNA0-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5]). The latter expression,referred to as degrees and decimal degrees, is most commonly used bysearch-and-rescue groups.Another commonly used position reference system is the Universal TransverseMercator (UTM) system, based on the metric system. This is often used with GPSreceivers and is discussed in detail in chapter 6[part0013.html#CCNA0-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5], along with more detailon using the latitude/longitude system with marine charts.The scale of a map is a ratio between measurements on the map and measurementsin the real world. A common way to state the scale is to compare a mapmeasurement with a ground measurement (as in 1 inch equals 1 mile) or to give aspecific mathematical ratio (as in the 1:24,000 scale most commonly used in theUnited States, where any one unit of measure on the map equals 24,000 units ofthe same measure on Earth). The scale is shown graphically, usually at thebottom of the map.Several different types of maps are available:Relief maps attempt to show terrain in three dimensions by using various shadesof green, gray, and brown, terrain sketching, and raised surfaces. They help invisualizing the ups and downs of the landscape and have some value in tripplanning. Relief maps are often displayed at visitors’ centers in national parksand recreation areas.Land management and recreation maps, published by the US Forest Service, theNational Park Service, other government agencies, and timber companies, arefrequently updated and thus are very useful for current details on roads,trails, ranger stations, and other works of the human hand. They usually showonly the horizontal relationship of natural features, without the contour linesthat indicate the shape of the land. These maps are often quite helpful for tripplanning.Sketch maps tend to be crudely drawn but often make up in specialized routedetail what they lack in draftsmanship. Such drawings can be effectivesupplements to other map and guidebook information.Guidebook maps vary greatly in quality. Some are merely sketches, while othersare accurate modifications of topographic maps. They often contain usefuldetails on roads, trails, and wilderness routes.Topographic maps are the best of all for wilderness travelers. They depicttopography, the shape of Earth’s surface, by showing contour lines thatrepresent constant elevations above and below sea level. These maps, essentialto off-trail travel, are produced in many countries. They should be broughtalong on all wilderness excursions, along with any of the above-mentioned maps.Some are produced by government agencies, such as the US Geological Survey(USGS), whereas others are printed by private companies. Some private companiesproduce maps based on USGS maps and update them with recent trail and roaddetails, sometimes combining sections of different USGS maps into one. Oneexample of such a company is Green Trails, Inc., which makes maps formountainous areas in the Pacific Northwest and a few other areas. These maps areoften useful supplements to standard topographic maps and are particularlyhelpful for trail hiking.As an example of topographic maps, we will look in detail at the USGS maps.USING USGS TOPOGRAPHIC MAPSOne type of USGS map commonly used by wilderness travelers covers an area of 7.5minutes (that is, ⅛ degree) of latitude by 7.5 minutes of longitude. These mapsare known as the 7.5-minute series. An older type of USGS map covers an area of15 minutes (that is, ¼ degree) of latitude by 15 minutes of longitude. Thesemaps are part of what is called the 15-minute series. Four 7.5-minute maps areneeded to cover the same area as one 15-minute map.The 7.5-minute map is the standard for the contiguous United States and Hawaiiand is the most commonly used type for wilderness travelers in the United Statesoutside of Alaska.•The scale is 1:24,000, or roughly 2.5 inches to the mile, or 4 centimeters (cm)to the kilometer (km).•Each map covers an area of approximately 6 by 9 miles (9 by 14 km), and the UTMsquares are one kilometer (km) on a side.The 15-minute map is the standard only for Alaska, due to its immense size.•The scale is 1:63,360, or exactly 1 inch to 1 mile, or 1.6 cm to 1 km. Thenorth–south extent of each Alaska map is 15 minutes, but the east–west extent isgreater than 15 minutes, because of the way in which the lines of longitudeconverge toward the North Pole.•Each map covers an area of about 12 to 16 miles (19 by 26 km) in the east–westdirection and 18 miles (28 km) in the north–south direction.Detailed descriptions of using the latitude/longitude and the UTM systems aregiven in chapter 6 [part0013.html#CCNA0-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5] ofthis book. What follows in this chapter is a description of basic topographicmap features of most interest to wilderness travelers.TIP: In Canada and most of the rest of the world where the metric system isused, the most commonly used comparable scale is 1:50,000. Scales of 1:25,000and others are occasionally used as well.READING TOPOGRAPHIC MAPSA map’s language is easy to learn and pays immediate rewards to any wildernesstraveler. Some of this language is in words, but most of it is in the form ofsymbols. Each map is referred to as a quadrangle (or quad) and covers an areabounded on the north and south by latitude lines that differ by an amount equalto the map series (7.5 minutes or 15 minutes) and on the east and west bylongitude lines that differ by the same amount, except for Alaska. Eachquadrangle is given the name of a prominent topographic or manmade feature inthe area.To read a topographic map, you’ll need to understand key map features such ascolors, contour lines, reference lines, and direction of slope.ColorsColors on a USGS topographic map have specific meanings:Red: Major roads and survey information.Blue: Rivers, lakes, springs, waterfalls, and other water features.Black: Minor roads, trails, railroads, buildings, benchmarks, latitude andlongitude lines, UTM coordinates and lines, and other features not part of thenatural environment.Green: Solid green indicates a forested area, while mottled green indicatesscrub vegetation. A lack of green does not mean that an area is devoid ofvegetation but simply that any growth is too small or scattered to show on themap. You should not be surprised if a small, narrow gully with no green color onthe map turns out to be an avalanche gully, choked with impassable brush in thesummer and fall and posing a significant avalanche hazard in the winter andspring.White: The color of the paper on which the map is printed; it can have a varietyof meanings, depending on the terrain.White with blue contour lines: A glacier or permanent snowfield. The contourlines of glaciers and permanent snowfields are in solid blue, with their edgesindicated by dashed blue lines. Elevations are shown in blue. Rope up for allglacier travel!White with brown contour lines: Any area without substantial forest, such as ahigh alpine area, a clear-cut, a rockslide, an avalanche gully, or a meadow.Study the map for other clues.Brown: Contour lines and elevations, everywhere except on glaciers and permanentsnowfields.Purple: Partial revision of an existing map.Be sure to be aware of the temporal nature of these map features, since logging,glacial expansion or recession, and other changes might have occurred since themap was last updated.Contour LinesThe heart of a topographic map is its overlay of contour lines, each lineindicating a constant elevation as it follows the shape of the landscape. Amap’s contour interval is the difference in elevation between two adjacentcontour lines. The contour interval is clearly printed at the bottom of the map.Every fifth contour line, called an index contour, is printed darker than theother lines and is labeled with the elevation.One of the most important bits of information a topographic map reveals iswhether you will be traveling uphill or downhill. If the route crosses lines ofincreasingly higher elevation, you will be going uphill. If it crosses lines ofdecreasing elevation, the route is downhill. Flat or sidehill travel isindicated by a route that crosses no lines, remaining within a single contourinterval.images [../images/00003.jpeg]Figure 1. Basic topographic featuresTopographic maps also show cliffs, passes, summits, and other features (figure 1[part0008.html#fig1]). Main features depicted by contour lines include thefollowing:Flat areas: No contour lines at all.Gentle slopes: Widely spaced contour lines.Steep slopes: Closely spaced contour lines.Cliffs: Contour lines extremely close together or even touching.Valleys, ravines, gullies, and couloirs: Contour lines in a pattern of Us forgentle, rounded valleys or gullies; Vs for sharp valleys and gullies. The Us andVs point uphill, in the direction of higher elevation.Ridges or spurs: Contour lines in a pattern of Us for gentle, rounded ridges; Vsfor sharp ridges. The Us and Vs point downhill, in the direction of lowerelevation.Peaks or summits: A concentric pattern of contour lines, with the summit beingthe innermost and highest ring. Peaks are also often indicated by Xs,elevations, benchmarks (BMs), or triangle symbols.Cirques or bowls: Patterns of contour lines forming at least a semicircle,rising from a low spot in the center to form a natural amphitheater at the headof a valley.Saddles, passes, or cols: An hourglass shape (with higher contour lines on twosides), indicating a low point on a ridge.TIP: As you travel in the wilderness, frequently observe the terrain andassociate its appearance with its depiction on the map. Note all the topographicfeatures—such as ridges, gullies, streams, and summits—as you pass them. Thishelps you to maintain a close estimate of exactly where you are and helps youbecome an expert map reader.You will get better and better at interpreting contour lines by comparing actualterrain with its representation on a map. The goal is to be able to glance at atopographic map and have a sharp mental image of just what the place will looklike. There is no substitute for experience, so be sure to pay close attentionto the appearance of various topographic features you see in the wilderness, andnote their depiction on the topo map. Before you venture into the wilderness, wesuggest that you carefully study figures 2 [part0008.html#fig2] through 5[part0008.html#fig5] to gain an appreciation of how various features shown inphotographs appear on topo maps.images [../images/00004.jpeg]Figure 2.

So if you have a map of a hilly or mountainous area,find a thin blue line indicating a stream, and examine the contour lines aroundit. The upward-pointing contour lines will remind you that they indicate agully.Declination InformationThe margins of USGS maps contain important information, such as the date ofpublication and revision, the names of maps of adjacent areas, contourintervals, and map scales. The margin also gives the area’s magnetic declinationat the time the map was last updated, which is the difference between true northand magnetic north. Declination is extremely important and will be discussed inmore detail in chapter 2 [part0009.html#8IL20-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5].Depending on when the map was printed, declination is labeled differently.•USGS topographic maps printed in 1988 or later (see figure 6A[part0008.html#fig6]) have a statement such as “1990 Magnetic North Declination20° EAST.”•Maps printed before 1988 usually have a declination diagram printed near thelower left-hand corner (see figure 6B [part0008.html#fig6]). The star indicatestrue north and the “MN” indicates magnetic north. The angle difference betweenthese two is the magnetic declination for that area at the time the map was lastupdated.North–South Reference LinesLines running north–south on the map are very important for using the map andcompass together, as will be explained in chapter 2[part0009.html#8IL20-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5]. Some maps have a grid ofUTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) lines printed on the map, and these can beused as north–south reference lines. North is usually at the top of the map,unless otherwise indicated.Maps printed in 1988 or later usually have a grid of black lines representingthe 1000-meter intervals of the UTM grid (see figure 6A [part0008.html#fig6]).This grid is usually slightly offset from true north, because the map isrepresenting our spherical planet on a flat surface, and therefore isintroducing a slight error. The amount of this offset is given by a statement inthe lower left corner of the map such as “UTM GRID DECLINATION 0°14' WEST.” TheUTM grid is very helpful when using a global positioning system (GPS) receiver(see chapter 9 [part0016.html#F8900-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5]). Theselines may also be used as a north–south reference (see chapter 2[part0009.html#8IL20-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5]), but only if the offsetof the grid is less than 1°. If the offset of the UTM grid is more than 1°, thenyou should use surveyors’ section lines (usually printed in red). If the map hasno section lines, or if the section lines do not truly run north–south, you candraw in your own north–south lines, as follows:images [../images/00008.jpeg]images [../images/00009.jpeg]Figure 6. Lower left corner of USGS topographic maps: A. newer than 1988, B.older than 1988•Put your map on a table and place one long edge of a long straightedge (such asa meter stick or a yardstick) along the left margin of the map (the left andright margins of a USGS topo map are aligned with true north).•Draw a line along the other side of the straightedge, and then move it over tothe line you just drew and draw another line, and another, and so on until youreach the center of the map.•Then place the straightedge along the right margin of the map and repeat theprocedure to meet the lines drawn in the previous step. (Doing this from bothsides will help you to achieve greater accuracy by avoiding any cumulativeerrors that might creep in from one line to another.)This way, you will have a set of north–south lines that are truly north–south.This will help you achieve accuracy in measuring and plotting bearings on themap using your compass (see chapter 2[part0009.html#8IL20-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5]).On maps printed prior to 1988, UTM lines are usually not shown. However, thereare faint (usually blue) UTM “tick” marks along the edges of such maps showingthe locations of the 1000-meter lines (see figure 6B [part0008.html#fig6]). Thedeclination diagrams for these maps usually have a line to GN, meaning gridnorth. This is the offset of the UTM grid from true north. If this offset isless than 1°, then you can connect these tick marks on your table at home usinga straightedge to place a UTM grid on the map, as explained above. You can thenuse these as north–south reference lines. However, if the amount of differencebetween true north and grid north is greater than 1°, then you should draw inyour own north–south lines parallel with the edges of the map, as describedearlier.images [../images/00010.jpeg]Figure 7. Examples of observing the direction of the slope on a mapDirection of the SlopeTraveling along a contour line means traveling on a roughly level route with noslope. Conversely, traveling in the direction perpendicular (at a right angle)to a contour line means traveling directly uphill or downhill, sometimes calledthe fall line. Knowing this can be a valuable clue as to your position. You caneasily find this direction on the map or in the field for any point on slopingterrain. This fact can be very useful in orientation, and we will refer to it inseveral places in this book. For example, in figure 7 [part0008.html#fig7],point G has a slope that falls off to the southwest. Point H, on the other hand,has a slope falling off roughly to the east. We will be able to express thisdirection more precisely after we explain how to measure and plot bearings usingthe compass in chapter 2 [part0009.html#8IL20-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5].Using the direction of the slope cannot prove that you are at any particularplace, but it can disprove it, and this can sometimes be a big help in trying tofigure out where you are.In figure 7 [part0008.html#fig7], for example, suppose you have climbed Peak6547 and have descended a few hundred feet. You wish to find out where you are,and you guess that you are at point G. That means that the slope should befalling off to the southwest. However, when standing on the slope and facingdownhill, you see the midday sun on your right, so you know that you are facingroughly east. This proves that you cannot be at point G. You could very possiblybe at point H, since at this point the slope falls off to the east. But thereare other places where the slope falls off to the east, so you cannot prove thatyou are at point H.KNOWING THE LIMITATIONS OF MAPSKeep a couple of cautionary thoughts in mind as you study a topographic map. Themap will not show all the terrain features that you actually see on your trip,because there is a limit to what mapmakers can cram onto the map withoutreducing it to an unreadable clutter. If a feature is not at least as high asthe contour interval, it may not be shown, so a 30-foot cliff may come as asurprise when you are navigating with a map that has a 40-foot contour interval.Check the date of the map, because topographic maps may not be revised veryoften, and information on forests and on roads and other works of the human handor natural disaster (such as the eruption of a volcano) could be out of date. Aforest may have been logged, a glacier may have advanced or receded, or a roadmay have been extended or closed since the last update. Although topographicmaps are essential to wilderness travel, you often need to supplement them withinformation from visitors to the area, guidebooks, websites, and other maps.TIP: When you learn of changes (such as road or trail closures), you should notethem on your map in pencil, along with the date.CUSTOMIZING AND MODIFYING MAPSSometimes a trip runs through portions of two or more maps. Adjoining maps canbe folded at the edges and brought together, or you can create your owncustomized map by cutting out the nonpertinent areas and splicing the resttogether with tape. Maps can also be created by using a computer and readilyavailable map software. When customizing maps, be sure to include plenty ofterritory so that you will have a good overview of the entire trip, includingthe surrounding area (which might be needed for orientation; see chapter 3[part0010.html#9H5K0-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5]).Black-and-white photocopies are good for marking the route, but since they donot show colors, they should be used only as supplements to the real thing. If adurable, high-quality reproduction is needed, then a color photocopy ontowaterproof paper with waterproof ink may be the best approach. Some outdoorrecreation stores have the capability to produce computer-generated mapscovering whatever area you want by combining various sections of USGSquadrangles. Though these customized maps are slightly more expensive than thestandard USGS quadrangles, you may appreciate their convenience.If you choose to cut off the white borders of your topo map to save weight andbulk, be sure to retain all of the important information at the bottom of themap, including the scale, contour interval, declination, datum, and UTM zone,even if such information may not seem important to you at the time. If you everdecide to use a GPS receiver, you may later regret having cut off and discardedthis essential information.CARRYING MAPS ON A WILDERNESS TRIPOne of the most important aspects of carrying a map is to do so in such a waythat you can get to it at any time. We suggest that you carry it in your pocket.TIP: Cargo pants or shorts with big pockets are excellent for carrying maps,compasses, and other objects that you want to access quickly and conveniently.It is a lot easier to make critical frequent observations if you can quickly getto your map at any time.Map FoldingOne good way to carry a map is to fold it to show the area where you will betraveling, and then enclose it in a clear plastic map case or a plastic ziplockbag. This way, it will be protected from the elements, always visible, easy toremove, and compact.It is best to fold your map so that your entire route for a given leg of thetrip will always be visible without unfolding the map, if possible. The foldedmap should also be slightly less than the size of a large cargo shorts or pantspocket (approximately 5 by 5 inches or 13 cm by 13 cm). With the finisheddimension in mind, fold your map so that your starting point is on one edge ofthe folded map, and fold up the remaining part of the map so that as much of theroute as possible is visible. At the main fold your route can continue to theother side of the map. It will then be very easy for you to flip your map overto the other side as your day progresses without the need to refold it.TIP: Try to keep folds away from key route junctions or other important areas ofinterest, since folds tend to degrade with time and wear, particularly if themap gets wet.Another way to keep your map accessible throughout your trip is to fold it toapproximately the inner dimensions of your camera case, and carry it inside thecase, held on the hip belt of your pack. Then you can easily check your locationon your map or take an impromptu photo.We recommend against laminating maps for your wilderness adventure, since doingso makes it difficult to fold or write on the map.FINDING AND BUYING MAPSMany outdoor recreation stores sell topographic maps, and some bookstores andnautical supply stores stock them as well. You can often find such stores bydoing an internet search for “topographic maps for [your area or state].”You can order topographic maps directly from the USGS by going to www.usgs.gov[http://www.usgs.gov] or by calling 1-888-ASK-USGS. If you do not know the nameof the map for the area you need, you can order or view a free Topographic MapIndex Circular for your state as well as a booklet entitled Topographic Maps.The index circular shows the names of all the quadrangles in your state, so youcan find the one(s) you need.You can also view, download, print, or purchase many topographic maps from theUSGS website. On the USGS homepage, click on Maps, Imagery, and Publications. Inthe Maps area of the next screen, you then have a choice to Download free topomaps, Buy maps printed on demand, or Make your own map. If you download topomaps, then you can print them out on your own printer, or you can bring a saveddigital copy to a local print shop to get a larger hard copy of the map. Manyother useful maps, publications, and aerial photographs are also available fromthe USGS website.To obtain topographic maps for Canada, call 1-800-465-6277, or write to CanadaMap Office, 615 Booth Street, Ottawa, Ontario, K1A 0E9. You can also do aninternet search for “Map Distribution Centres” and other stores. Severalexamples are www.canmaps.com/topographic [http://www.canmaps.com/topographic],www.maptown.com/canadamaps.html [http://www.maptown.com/canadamaps.html], andwww.mytopo.com [http://www.mytopo.com].You can create your own topographic maps with software such as theAllTrails/National Geographic’s Ultimate Outdoor Map Kit (a subscription costingabout $40 per year), www.caltopo.com [http://www.caltopo.com] (for topo maps ofthe entire United States (not just California), www.mytopo.com[http://www.mytopo.com], DeLorme’s Topo North America,www.mappingsupport.com/p/gmap4.html[http://www.mappingsupport.com/p/gmap4.html], and other websites found with aninternet search. Keep in mind that your software-generated map will only be asgood as allowed by your printer. We highly recommend getting a color printer ifyou choose to do this, since color is such an important part of any topographicmap. You can also check with any local outdoor clubs in your geographic area(e.g., The Mountaineers, The Mazamas, The Sierra Club, the Colorado MountainClub, and other organizations) to get recommendations for local map sources.It is possible to purchase waterproof paper on which to print maps, but the inksused in many consumer-level printers are not waterproof, and the colors may runif such maps get wet. If you print your own maps, be sure to test them to findout how waterproof they are, and take extra care to keep them dry if they arenot waterproof.THE IMPORTANCE OF A MAPWith the exception of your brain, a map is your most important navigationaltool. No one should venture into the wilderness without one, nor without theability to interpret it. You should also have ready access to it, and shouldconsult it frequently during your wilderness adventure. Note that the subtitleof this book is “Finding Your Way Using Map, Compass, Altimeter & GPS.” Theorder of these words was chosen carefully to list these four items in order fromhighest to lowest priority: first, a map, then a compass, and so on. Maps giveyou information about direction, the distance between any two points, the shapeof the terrain, human and natural features, the amount of vegetation, thelocation of water features, the direction and grade of the slope, and more. Butas useful as maps are, they become even more powerful when used with a compass.CHAPTER SUMMARYIn this chapter you learned about basic map terminology and how to readtopographic maps.

Though these principles are easy to learn and apply, theyare nevertheless crucial to successful operation of the compass, so we urge youto study them carefully. If you learn these well, you will become proficient inusing the map and compass in the wilderness.The compass is a very simple device that can do a wondrous thing: It can revealat any time and any place exactly what direction it is pointing. On a simplewilderness trek in good weather, the compass may never leave your pack orpocket. But as the route becomes more complex or as the weather worsens, or ifyou are merely curious about identifying various features in your surroundings,it comes into its own as a critical tool of wilderness travel.A compass is nothing more than a magnetized needle that responds to Earth’smagnetic field. Compass makers have added a few things to this basic unit tomake it easier to use. But stripped to the core, there is just that needle,aligned with Earth’s magnetism, and from that known reference line we candetermine any other direction.TYPES OF BASEPLATE COMPASSESThe basic features (see figure 8A [part0009.html#fig8]) of a baseplate compassto be used for wilderness travel include:•A freely rotating magnetic needle—one end is a different color (usually red)from the other so you can tell which end points to north.•A circular, rotating housing, capsule, or bezel, for the needle—filled with afluid that dampens (reduces) the vibrations of the needle, making readings moreaccurate.•A dial around the circumference of the housing—graduated clockwise in 1- or2-degree increments, from 0° to 360°.•An orienting arrow within the capsule, to align with the needle.•A set of parallel meridian lines—located below the needle, which rotate withthe bezel, separate from the baseplate.•An index line—used to set and read bearings.•A transparent, rectangular baseplate for the entire unit—including adirection-of-travel line (sometimes with an arrow at one end) to point towardyour objective. The longer the baseplate, the more accurate your readings willbe.Optional features (see figure 8B [part0009.html#fig8]) available on somecompasses include:•An adjustable declination arrow—an easy, dependable way to correct for magneticdeclination; well worth the added cost.•A sighting mirror—another way to improve accuracy.•A ruler or rulers—calibrated in inches and/or millimeters, and/or with latitudeand longitude or UTM lines; used to measure short distances or to locate yourposition on a map.•A clinometer—used to measure the angle of a slope in the field.•A magnifying glass bubble—used to help read closely spaced contour lines andother details on maps.•Roamer (sometimes spelled romer) scales to enable you to identify your positionmore precisely on topo maps with UTM lines; particularly useful when using a GPSreceiver. If you get a compass without roamer scales, there are several otherways to identify your UTM position on topo maps (see chapter 6[part0013.html#CCNA0-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5]).images [../images/00011.jpeg]Figure 8. Features of compasses used in wilderness navigation: A. essentialfeatures, B. useful optional featuresTIP: If you purchase a compass with roamer scales, be sure that it has the samescale(s) as your topographic map(s), for example, 1:24,000 for USGS topo maps inthe United States, and 1:50,000 for metric maps in Canada and elsewhere.Some compasses have an adjustable declination arrow but no mirror. These cost alittle more than the basic compass of figure 8A [part0009.html#fig8] butconsiderably less than the full-featured compass of figure 8B[part0009.html#fig8]. They offer a good value for someone who prefers theadjustable declination arrow but does not want the added cost and/or weight ofthe mirror.COMPASS SAFETYMost compasses have a lanyard—a piece of cord a foot (30 cm) or a little longerfor attaching the compass to your belt, jacket, or pack. It is not a good ideato put the lanyard around your neck; this can be an unsafe practice,particularly when doing any technical climbing, difficult scrambling, or whenclimbing over and under fallen logs, due to the possibility of strangulation.Furthermore, most lanyards are so short that the compass cannot be usedeffectively while it is around your neck anyway.The baseplate compasses listed here are the ones we know about as we go topress. By the time the book hits the streets, some of these may be discontinued,while still others may appear. But this listing should at least give you an ideaof the types of compasses that are available.•Full-featured (see table 1 [part0009.html#tab1]): These top-of-the-linecompasses have a declination adjustment and a mirror, and some have clinometers.Though more expensive than other compasses, these are best for wildernessnavigation. We strongly recommend this type of compass.•With declination adjustment but no mirror (see table 2 [part0009.html#tab2]):If you do not wish to get a full-featured compass, then we urge you to at leastget one with adjustable declination, as listed in table 2 [part0009.html#tab2].Note the designation adjustable declination; this is different from a fixed(nonadjustable) declination scale, which is a feature of some nonadjustablecompasses.•With mirror but no declination adjustment (see table 3 [part0009.html#tab3]):Some people buy this type of compass, mistakenly assuming that since it has amirror it must also have adjustable declination; this is not true. We do notrecommend this type. If you already have such a compass and do not wish toreplace it, we will show you how to adapt it for wilderness navigation use laterin this chapter.Table 1. Recommended Full-Featured Compassesimages [../images/00012.jpeg]*Current favorites, according to The Mountaineers’ navigation courseinformation.•Minimal compasses (see table 4 [part0009.html#tab4]): These meet all the basicrequirements for wilderness travel but do not have features such as mirrors ordeclination corrections. We do not recommend any of these. However, if youalready have such a compass and do not wish to replace it, we will show you howto adapt it for wilderness navigation use later in this chapter.•Unacceptable compasses: Wrist and zipper-pull compasses, and those with scalesmarked in five-degree increments or without rectangular, transparent baseplatesare unacceptable. Other unacceptable compasses are those found on smart phones,watches, and GPS devices, since they do not have transparent rectangularbaseplates, and therefore cannot be used with maps.If cost is not your primary factor, we strongly recommend any of thefull-featured compasses if you can afford it. If minimum cost is your primaryconcern, any of the minimal compasses will work, though you will need to make aslight modification to correct for magnetic declination, which will be describedlater. If you can afford a better compass than the minimal but do not wish tospend enough to get a full-featured model, then we recommend getting a compasswith a declination adjustment but without a mirror or clinometer. Of all theoptional features, the declination adjustment is the most useful. We highlyrecommend this feature.Table 2. Recommended Compasses (without a sighting mirror)images [../images/00013.jpeg]Note: All these compasses feature adjustable declination.*Current favorites, according to The Mountaineers’ navigation courseinformation.Table 3. Compasses without Adjustable Declination (not recommended)images [../images/00014.jpeg]Note: These compasses are not recommended due to their lack of declinationadjustment.The Silva, Suunto, and K & R compasses listed in the tables have meridian linesin the transparent base, as shown in figure 8 [part0009.html#fig8]. Some of theBrunton models do not have meridian lines but can nevertheless be usedsuccessfully in wilderness navigation using slightly different methods. OtherBrunton models have declination adjustment methods that differ from those usedby other manufacturers. In order to simplify our explanation of compass use, wewill defer the discussion of those Brunton models until chapter 7[part0014.html#DB7S0-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5]. The rest of the presentchapter is therefore devoted to using compasses with meridian lines in thetransparent base.Table 4. Minimal Compasses (not recommended)images [../images/00015.jpeg]Note: These compasses are not recommended because they lack sighting mirrors oradjustable declination.SELECTING AND PURCHASING A COMPASSTables 1 [part0009.html#tab1] through 4 [part0009.html#tab4] contain thefeatures and approximate costs for some of the most widely available compassesat the present time. For serious wilderness navigating, we recommend only thoseshown in tables 1 [part0009.html#tab1] and 2 [part0009.html#tab2]. All of thesehave adjustable declination, a feature we consider nearly essential. Compassesthat come with a small tool (usually connected to the lanyard) to make thisadjustment, often referred to as a “gear-driven” adjustment, are recommended asthe easiest to use and the most trouble-free.The difference between the compasses in table 1 [part0009.html#tab1] and thosein table 2 [part0009.html#tab2] is that those in table 1 [part0009.html#tab1]have mirrors whereas those in table 2 [part0009.html#tab2] do not. The primaryadvantage of the mirror is that most people can obtain more accurate compassreadings with a mirrored compass. Furthermore, the mirror effectively doublesthe length of the baseplate, thereby making it easier to use to measure and plotbearings on a map. (We will explain the use of the compass mirror later in thischapter.) Other purposes for the mirror include its possible use in emergencysignaling, and to ensure complete coverage in the application of sunscreen toyour face. If these features are not important to you, then you may consider acompass listed in table 2 [part0009.html#tab2]. Most of these are less expensivethan those in table 1 [part0009.html#tab1] but have many of the characteristicsof the full-featured compasses other than the mirror.The selection of compasses available at outdoor recreation and sporting goodsstores is often limited. If you live near such stores, we suggest that you trythem first, since you should be able to examine the compass carefully and try itout in the store before purchasing it. Try the declination adjustment featurewhile in the store, and ensure that it functions properly. We have heardcomplaints from some people who have purchased compasses with manufacturingdefects and have had to return them. If the compass you want is not available ata nearby store, then try an online website. Here, returning a defective unit isnot as immediate as at a local store, but you will have a wider selection.images [../images/00016.jpeg]Figure 9. Cardinal and intermediate directions and corresponding bearings indegrees on the compassBefore purchasing from an online source, be sure to check the company’s returnpolicy to ensure that you can easily return a defective compass. On somewebsites, you can view customers’ reviews of particular compasses, to assesstheir strengths and weaknesses, and to learn of any problems others may haveencountered with them.BEARINGSA bearing is the direction from one place to another, measured in degrees ofangle with respect to an accepted reference line. This reference is the line totrue north, also called a meridian.The round dial of a compass is divided into 360°. The direction in degrees toeach of the cardinal directions, going clockwise around the dial starting fromthe top, is north, 0° (also 360°); east, 90°; south, 180°; and west, 270° (seefigure 9 [part0009.html#fig9]).BEARING AND AZIMUTHTechnically, there is a subtle difference between these two terms, but inconventional modern usage they are essentially the same. A bearing hastraditionally been defined as the angle between either north or south andanother location, measured between zero and 90 degrees (such as S 45 W, meaning45 degrees west of south). An azimuth, on the other hand, is the angle measuredclockwise from north, from zero to 360 degrees (225 degrees in this sameexample). Many compass manufacturers today, however, define a bearing to be thesame as the traditional definition of the azimuth. In this book, we treat thetwo as equivalent, and refer to them only by the term bearing, to be consistentwith compass manufacturers. For example, some compasses have index lines thatare marked “read bearing here.”The compass is used for two basic tasks regarding bearings:1.To take, or measure, bearings. To take a bearing means to measure thedirection from one point to another, either on a map or in the field.2.To plot, or follow, bearings. To plot, or follow, a bearing means to set acertain bearing on the compass and then to plot out, or to follow, where thatbearing points, either on the map or in the field.BEARINGS IN THE FIELDAll bearings in the field are based on where the magnetic needle points. For thesake of simplicity, we will first ignore the effects of magnetic declination, asubject that will be taken up in the next section. Let us imagine that we are incentral Missouri, where the declination is negligible.To take (measure) a bearing in the field: Hold the compass in front of you and1.Point the direction-of-travel line at the object whose bearing you want tofind.2.Rotate the compass housing or bezel until the pointed end of the orientingarrow is aligned with the north-seeking (usually red) end of the magneticneedle. (This process is sometimes referred to as boxing the needle or “gettingthe dog in the doghouse.”)3.Read the bearing at the index line (see figure 10 [part0009.html#fig10]).If the compass has no sighting mirror, hold it at or near arm’s length and at ornear waist level, with your arm straight at about a 45° angle from your body(see figure 11 [part0009.html#fig11]). This is a compromise between sightingwith the compass at eye level (sighting on your objective along the edge of thecompass, without being able to see the compass needle or orienting arrow) orholding it straight down (being able to see the compass needle and arrow withoutparallax but losing sight of the objective).images [../images/00017.jpeg]Figure 10. Taking a compass bearing in the field in an area with zerodeclinationimages [../images/00018.jpeg]Figure 11. Taking a bearing using a compass that does not have a mirrorimages [../images/00019.jpeg]Figure 12. Taking a bearing using a compass with a mirrorimages [../images/00020.jpeg]Figure 13. Close-up of taking a bearing using a compass with a mirrorWith a sighting mirror, no such compromise is necessary. Fold the mirror back toabout a 45° angle and hold the compass at eye level, with the sight pointing atthe object (see figure 12 [part0009.html#fig12]). Observe the magnetic needleand the orienting arrow in the mirror as you rotate the housing to align theneedle and the arrow (see figure 13 [part0009.html#fig13]). The centerline ofthe mirror should cross the pivot point of the magnetic needle. In either case,hold the compass level. Keep it away from metal objects, which can easilydeflect the magnetic needle, giving you a false reading.To follow (plot) a bearing in the field: Simply reverse the process you used totake a bearing.1.Rotate the compass housing or bezel until you have set the desired bearing atthe index line, say 270° (West).2.Hold the compass level in front of you, at roughly arm’s length and waistheight. Turn your entire body (including your feet) until the north-seeking endof the magnetic needle is aligned with the pointed end of the orienting arrow(i.e., box the needle).3.The direction-of-travel line is now pointing in whatever direction you haveset at the index line, in this case west.When following a bearing, it is best to find some object, such as a big rock ora unique-looking tree, that is in the same direction as the desired bearing.Then put the compass away and walk toward that object until you arrive at it,and repeat the process with another visible landmark. This is far better (saferand faster) than walking along, compass in hand, constantly observing thecompass, rather than watching where you are going.MAGNETIC DECLINATIONA compass needle is attracted to magnetic north, while most maps are printedwith true north—the direction to the geographic north pole—at the top. Thisdifference between the direction to true north and the direction to magneticnorth, measured in degrees, is called magnetic declination. Most compasses willneed a simple adjustment or modification to correct for declination.Magnetic declination varies from place to place and over time. Always use themost current topographic map for your area. To find the amount and direction ofdeclination for the map, look in the lower left corner on USGS topographic maps(see figure 6 [part0008.html#fig6]). If the map is more than a few years old,the declination may be somewhat out of date. The amount of declination changesover time, by as much as one degree every five years in some places in theUnited States. The map of the United States (except for Alaska) shown in figure15 [part0009.html#fig15] will give you a fairly good idea of the declination inyour area. The map is for 2015 and is valid to within one degree for the timeinterval from 2010 to 2020. (See chapter 7[part0014.html#DB7S0-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5] for more information ondetermining the correct present declination.) Figure 14 [part0009.html#fig14] isa declination map for the state of Alaska, also for the year 2015. (Alaska is sobig that it deserves a map of its own.)In figure 15 [part0009.html#fig15], you can see that the line of zerodeclination (called the agonic line) coincidentally runs through parts ofMinnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas, and Louisiana at this time. Along thisline, the magnetic needle points in the same direction as the geographic northpole (true north), so no correction for declination is necessary.images [../images/00021.jpeg]Figure 14. Magnetic declination in Alaska in 2015In areas west of this line, the magnetic needle points somewhere to the east (tothe right) of true north, so these areas are said to have east declination. Itworks just the opposite on the other side of the line of zero declination, suchas on the East Coast of the United States or Canada. Here, the magnetic needlepoints somewhere to the west (left) of true north, so these areas are said tohave west declination.images [../images/00022.jpeg]Figure 15. Magnetic declination in the contiguous United States and Hawaii in2015images [../images/00023.jpeg]Figure 16. Magnetic and true bearings: A. in Washington (east declination), B.in New Hampshire (west declination)Consider a wilderness traveler in western Washington state, with a declinationof 16° east in 2015. The true bearing is a measurement of the angle between theline to true north and the line to the objective, as shown in figure 16A[part0009.html#fig16]. The magnetic needle, however, is pulled toward magneticnorth, not true north. So the compass measures the angle between the line tomagnetic north and the line to the objective. This “magnetic bearing” is 16°less than the true bearing. To get the true bearing, you could add 16° to themagnetic bearing.As in Washington state, travelers in all areas west of the zero declination linecould add the declination to the magnetic bearing to get a true bearing. Incentral Colorado, for example, about 9° would be added. In the central Utah, itis about 11°.East of the zero declination line, the declination can be subtracted from themagnetic bearing to get the true bearing. In New Hampshire, for example (seefigure 16B [part0009.html#fig16]), the magnetic bearing is about 15° greaterthan the true bearing. To get a true bearing, the traveler in New Hampshirecould subtract the declination of 15° from the magnetic bearing to obtain thetrue bearing.This is all very simple in theory but can be confusing in practice, and thewilderness is no place for mental arithmetic that can potentially have seriousconsequences. A more practical way to handle the minor complication ofdeclination is to pay more for your compass and get one with an adjustabledeclination arrow instead of a fixed orienting arrow. (These are the ones listedin tables 1 [part0009.html#tab1] and 2 [part0009.html#tab2] earlier.) Byfollowing the instructions supplied with the compass, you can easily set thedeclination arrow—usually by inserting a tiny screwdriver (often attached to thelanyard) into a small slot on the bezel and turning it until the declinationarrow points at the correct number of degrees east or west of the index line.Then the bearing that you read at the index line will automatically be the truebearing, and concern about a declination error is one worry you can leave athome. Compasses with adjustable declination arrows are sometimes called “set andforget” compasses.If you have a compass with adjustable declination and set it for a declinationof 16° E, as for western Washington state, then, once properly adjusted, thepointed end of the declination arrow will point to 16°, as shown in figure 17[part0009.html#fig17]. In New Hampshire, with a declination of 15° W, thecorrectly adjusted declination arrow will point to 345° (15° less than 360°).images [../images/00024.jpeg]Figure 17. Compass with adjustable declination, set to 16° east declination, asfor western Washington state in 2015On compasses without adjustable declination arrows, you can achieve the sameeffect by sticking a thin strip of adhesive or masking tape to the bottom of therotating housing or bezel to serve as a customized declination arrow. Trim thetape to a point, and apply it to the underside of the compass for the area whereyou will be traveling, as shown in figure 18 [part0009.html#fig18].In western Washington, your taped declination arrow must point at 16° east(clockwise) from the 360° point (marked N for north) on the rotating dial(figure 18A [part0009.html#fig18]). In New Hampshire, the declination arrow mustpoint at 15° west (counterclockwise) from the 360° mark (figure 18B[part0009.html#fig18]), or 345°. Note that this taped declination arrow islocated in exactly the same place as the adjustable declination arrow describedabove.images [../images/00025.jpeg]Figure 18. Compass declination corrections: A. for an area west of thezero-declination line, B. for an area east of the zero-declination lineSome compasses have a nonadjustable declination scale numbered from 0° to 50° ormore, both east and west. You can use this scale to locate the proper positionfor your taped declination arrow (such as 15° west rather than at 345°). Figure19 [part0009.html#fig19] illustrates a nonadjustable compass with such a tapeddeclination arrow for a location in Newfoundland with a declination of 20degrees west.images [../images/00026.jpeg]Figure 19. Taped declination arrow for a location in Newfoundland withdeclination 20° westIf you travel to an area with different declination, you will have to change thedeclination correction. If you have a compass with an adjustable declinationarrow, a minor adjustment will allow you to set the compass for the newdeclination. If you have a taped declination arrow, you will have to peel thetape off and put a new arrow on, to correct for the new declination.Once your compass is adjusted or modified for the proper declination, you canfollow the same procedure to take and follow bearings as used in the earlierexamples for Missouri. The only difference is that, from now on, you will alignthe magnetic needle with the declination arrow instead of with the orientingarrow.TIP: When using the magnetic needle in the field for taking and followingbearings, always remember to align the north-seeking (red) end of the magneticneedle with the pointed end of the declination arrow to box the needle.From here on we will assume that you are using a compass with a declinationarrow—either an adjustable arrow or a taped arrow that you have added. For allbearings in the field, you will align the needle with this declination arrow.All compass bearings used from this point on are true bearings. We will notrefer to magnetic bearings again, since we always automatically convert allbearings to true ones using one of the two techniques described above.BACK BEARINGSA back bearing (also called back azimuth) is the opposite direction of abearing. This is also sometimes referred to as a reciprocal bearing. Backbearings are often useful when you are trying to follow a certain bearing, andyou want to check to see if you are still on the bearing line by taking a backbearing on your starting point. If your original bearing is less than 180°, thenyou can find the back bearing by adding 180° to the original bearing. If youroriginal bearing is greater than 180°, then you can find the back bearing bysubtracting 180° from the original bearing. For example, if you are traveling ata bearing of 90°, then the back bearing is 270°. Once you reach yourdestination, following the back bearing of 270° should get you back to yourstarting point.We previously mentioned that we do not recommend mental arithmetic in thewilderness, since it is too easy to make mistakes. A better way of working witha back bearing is to keep the original bearing at the index line, and rotate thecompass until the south-seeking end (the white or black end) of the magneticneedle is aligned with the pointed end of the declination arrow, as shown infigure 20 [part0009.html#fig20]. The use of back bearings in wildernessnavigation will be described in more detail in chapter 4[part0011.html#AFM60-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5].images [../images/00027.jpeg]Figure 20. Finding a back bearing using a compassBEARINGS ON A MAPYou can use your compass as a protractor, both to measure and to plot bearingson a map. Magnetic north and magnetic declination have nothing to do with theseoperations. Therefore, ignore the magnetic needle when measuring or plottingbearings on a map. (The only time you need to use the magnetic needle whenworking with the map is whenever you choose to orient the map to true north,which we will explain in chapter 3[part0010.html#9H5K0-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5]. But there is no need toorient the map to measure or plot bearings.)To measure a bearing on a map (see figure 21 [part0009.html#fig21]):1.Place the compass on the map with one long edge of the baseplate runningbetween the two points of interest. To measure the bearing from point A to pointB, make sure that the direction-of-travel line is pointing parallel to thedirection from A to B (not the reverse).2.Turn the rotating housing (bezel) until its set of meridian lines is parallelto the north–south lines of the map. Be sure that the N on the compass dial istoward the top of the map and that the S is toward the bottom. (If you put the Ntoward the bottom of the map, with the S toward the top, your reading will be180° off.) For the utmost in accuracy, slide the compass along the bearing lineso that one of its meridian lines is exactly on top of one of the north–southlines on the map.3.Now read the number that is at the index line. This is the bearing from pointA to point B.images [../images/00028.jpeg]Figure 21. Measuring a bearing on a map with the compass as a protractor(magnetic needle omitted for clarity)Example: Suppose you are at the summit of Panic Peak, and you want to know whichof the many peaks around you is Deception Dome. Your map shows both peaks(figure 21 [part0009.html#fig21]), so you can measure the bearing from point A,Panic Peak, to point B, Deception Dome. The result, as read at the index line,is 34°. (In this figure, we have purposely omitted the magnetic needle for thesake of clarity, and because it is not used here.) You can then hold the compassout in front of you and turn your entire body until you box the needle. Thedirection-of-travel line will then point toward Deception Dome and you canidentify it.images [../images/00029.jpeg]Figure 22. Plotting a bearing on a map with the compass as a protractor(magnetic needle omitted for clarity)To plot a bearing on the map: In this case you are starting with a knownbearing. And where does that bearing come from? From an actual landscape compassreading. Let us take a hypothetical example: Your friend returns from abackpacking trip, remorseful for having left a camera somewhere along the trail.While at a rest stop, your friend took a photo, and at the same spot had taken abearing on Mount Magnificent and found it to be 130°. That is all you need toknow. You are heading into that same area next weekend, so get out the MountMagnificent quadrangle, and here is what you do (see figure 22[part0009.html#fig22]):1.First set the bearing of 130° at the compass index line. Place the compass onthe map, one long edge of the baseplate touching the summit of MountMagnificent.2.Rotate the entire compass (not just the housing) until the meridian lines inthe compass housing are parallel with the map’s north–south lines, and make surethat the edge of the baseplate is still touching the summit. Again, make surethat the N on the compass dial is toward the top of the map.3.Draw a line along the edge of the baseplate. Where this line crosses the trailis where your friend’s camera is (or was).When measuring or plotting bearings on a map, the map does not need to be in ahorizontal position, such as lying down on the snow or dirt, on a stump, or inthe mud. Instead, it can be vertical or in any other position. Its orientationdoesn’t matter, since you are just using the compass as a protractor.In the forest, you can place the compass up against a tree to do the map andcompass work. On a snowfield or glacier, with no trees, you can instead askanother member of the party to stand still while you steady the map against theperson’s pack or back. Or you can sit down on your pack, and do the map work inyour lap or on your knee with your legs crossed.PRACTICING WITH A COMPASSBefore you count on your compass skills in the wilderness, test them in an areanear your home. The best place to practice is a place where you already know allthe answers, such as at a street intersection where the roads run north–southand east–west.•Take a bearing in a direction you know to be east. When you have pointed thedirection-of-travel line at something that you know is east of you, such asalong the edge of the street or sidewalk, and have boxed the needle, the numberat the index line should be very close to 90°.•Repeat for the other cardinal directions: south, west, and north (see figure 9[part0009.html#fig9]). Then try all four again to see how repeatable thebearings are.•Try to refine your technique to improve your accuracy. You may have to hold thecompass higher or lower, or perhaps close one eye. Find out how accurate you canbe. After some practice, you should consistently be able to get to within twodegrees of the correct bearing. This is usually adequate. (If you cannot achievethis level of accuracy, or if you need better accuracy, you can get an opticalsighting compass; see chapter 7[part0014.html#DB7S0-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5]).•Then try the reverse process. Pretend you do not know which way is west. Set270° (West) at the index line and hold the compass out in front of you as youturn your entire body (including your feet) until the needle is boxed. Thedirection-of-travel line should now point west. Does it?•Repeat for the other three cardinal directions.This set of exercises will help you to develop your skills related to andself-confidence around reading compasses and is also a way to check the accuracyof your compass. And if you make a mistake or two, well, no harm done.You can practice measuring and plotting bearings on a map using the examplesshown in figures 21 [part0009.html#fig21] and 22 [part0009.html#fig22]. Thesefigures are drawn with the correct angular proportions, so if you place yourcompass on the page you should get the same answers we get.If you ever doubt the accuracy of your compass—perhaps because it has developeda small bubble or has given you a questionable reading in the field—take it outto the street intersection again to test it. If the bearings you read are morethan a few degrees away from the correct ones, consider replacing your compass.(Compass needles can sometimes become demagnetized or their magnetic orientationcan even reverse, if the compass is stored in areas with strong electric ormagnetic fields.)Look for places to practice in the wilderness. A good place is any knownlocation (such as a summit or a lakeshore) from which you can identify yourexact position and can see identifiable landmarks. Take bearings on some ofthese and plot them on the map to see how close the result is to your actuallocation.TIPS AND CAUTIONS FOR COMPASS USEThere is a big difference between using a compass for working with a map andusing a compass for fieldwork. In the field, you must box the needle by aligningthe pointed end of the declination arrow with the red end of the magneticneedle. When measuring and plotting bearings on a map, however, you ignore thecompass needle. Just align the meridian lines in the compass housing with thenorth–south lines on the map, with the N of the compass dial toward north on themap. In both cases, the direction-of-travel line must point from you to yourobjective.You may have heard that nearby metal can mess up a compass bearing. This istrue. Ferrous objects such as iron and steel will deflect the magnetic needleand give false readings. Keep the compass away from belt buckles, ice axes, andother metal objects. Some wristwatches, particularly electronic ones, can alsocause false readings if they are too close to the compass. Large electricalcurrents, such as those in nearby powerlines, can induce electromagnetic fieldsthat can also disrupt compass bearings. If a compass reading does not makesense, see if nearby metal or electricity is sabotaging your bearing.Keep your wits about you when pointing the direction-of-travel line and thedeclination arrow. If you point either of them backward—an easy thing to do—thereading will be 180° off. If the bearing is north, the compass will say it issouth. Remember that the north-seeking end of the magnetic needle must bealigned with the pointed end of the declination arrow and that thedirection-of-travel line must point from you to your objective.NAVIGATION TIPWhenever you measure or plot bearings on a map, it is a good idea to first guessat the answer, based on your knowledge of the cardinal directions. Then if thebearing you carefully measure or plot is nowhere near your original guess, youmay have made one of those 180° errors.For example, suppose you want to measure a bearing on a map, and this bearing issomewhere between northeast (45°) and east (90°). You might guess that it is 60°to 70° or so. Then suppose you measure the bearing as accurately as possibleusing your compass with the map. You line up one of the compass meridian linesexactly on top of one of the map’s north–south lines, getting the bearingaccurate to the nearest degree, and the number you read at your index line is247°. Does this agree with your original guess? No! You must have made one ofthose 180° mistakes, and the correct answer is 67°.When taking and following bearings in the field, you can also begin by making anintelligent guess at the result, then use the compass to get the exact answer.Before blindly following the compass, you can then ask yourself if the resultfrom the compass agrees with your rough guess and common sense.If in doubt, trust your compass. The compass, correctly used, is almost alwaysright, while your contrary judgment may be clouded by fatigue, confusion, orhurry. If you get a nonsensical reading, check to see if perhaps you are makinga 180° error. If not, and if no metal or electricity is nearby, verify thereading with other members of the party, using different compasses. If they getthe same answer, trust your compass over hunches, blind guesses, and intuition.CARRYING YOUR COMPASSIt is a good idea to carry your compass in a place that is readily accessible,so that you can easily and quickly check your compass without taking off yourpack. Carrying your compass in a cargo pocket will accomplish this. If it isinconvenient to get to your compass, it is unlikely that you will use it whenyou should.MAP AND COMPASS: A CHECKLISTDo you have the hang of it? There are four essential compass operations that youmust learn: taking and following bearings in the field, and measuring andplotting bearings on the map. Let us summarize these one last time. Check offeach operation as you do it.TO TAKE A BEARING IN THE FIELD1.Hold the compass level, in front of you. Point the direction-of-travel line atthe desired object.2.Rotate the compass housing or bezel to align the pointed end of thedeclination arrow with the red end of the magnetic needle (box the needle).3.Read the bearing at the index line.TO FOLLOW A BEARING IN THE FIELD1.Set the desired bearing at the index line.2.Hold the compass level, in front of you. Turn your entire body, including yourfeet, until the red end of the magnetic needle is aligned with the pointed endof the declination arrow (box the needle).3.Travel in the direction shown by the direction-of-travel line.TO MEASURE A BEARING ON A MAP (see figure 21 [part0009.html#fig21])1.Place the compass on the map, with one long edge of the baseplate joining twopoints of interest. The direction-of-travel line points to your objective.2.Rotate the housing to align the compass meridian lines with the north–southlines on the map, with N on the compass toward the top of the map.3.Read the bearing at the index line.TO PLOT A BEARWG ON A MAP (see figure 22 [part0009.html#fig22])1.Set the desired bearing at the index line.2.Place the compass on the map, with one long edge of the baseplate on thefeature from which you wish to plot the bearing.3.Turn the entire compass to align its meridian lines with the map’s north–southlines, with N on the compass toward the top of the map. The edge of thebaseplate is now on the bearing line.Whenever you perform any of these operations, first guess at the answer, andperform the operation as accurately as you can. Then compare your answer to youroriginal guess to ensure that you are not making a 180° error. Ensure that youranswer makes sense to you.AND FOR THE LAST TIME•When taking and following bearings in the field, always align the pointed endof the declination arrow with the north-seeking (red) end of the magnetic needle(box the needle).•Never use the magnetic needle or the declination arrow when measuring orplotting bearings on the map. Just make sure that the N on the compass dial istoward north on the map, not south, as a check to ensure that the compassmeridian lines are not upside-down.Once you master these four essential operations with the compass, you will haveall the basic knowledge you need for map-and-compass orientation, navigation,and routefinding. The remainder of this book is based on these operations. Ifyou thoroughly understand how to do them, you can proceed through the rest ofthe book with confidence, and you will easily understand everything that weexplain.If you are unsure of any of these four operations, we suggest that you stop nowand reread this chapter. Study it carefully. Do the simple street-corner compassexercises we described for taking and following bearings. Measure and plot thebearings shown in figures 21 [part0009.html#fig21] and 22 [part0009.html#fig22].You must thoroughly understand each of these operations before proceeding withthe rest of this book.See chapter 7 [part0014.html#DB7S0-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5] foradditional information on compasses and geomagnetism. You are particularly urgedto read chapter 7 [part0014.html#DB7S0-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5] if youever plan to travel to foreign lands on distant continents, where you may notknow the declination or where the compass may be adversely affected by magneticdip.Once you thoroughly understand the basics, you are ready for orientation withmap and compass.CHAPTER SUMMARYIn this chapter you learned about baseplate compasses and how to deal withmagnetic declination. You also learned about the four basic operations ofcompass use.SKILLS CHECK•List three features of a compass recommended for wilderness navigation.•Briefly explain magnetic declination and its importance.•List the four basic operations of compass use.PRACTICE PROBLEMSSee the appendix[part0019_split_000.html#I3QM0-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5] for probleminstructions.•Problems 17 and 24 involve measuring bearings on a map.•Problem 18 involves plotting a bearing on a map."},{"pageContent":"Chapter3Orientation with Map and CompassNow that you have learned the fundamentals of map and compass use, you can putthem to work to perform the process of orientation. This chapter will show youhow to use map and compass techniques to determine exactly where you are onEarth’s surface.CHAPTER OBJECTIVES•Master the science of orientation first by keeping track of your positionthrough awareness and observation.•Learn the meaning of point, line, and area position.•Learn how to orient a map with your surroundings.•Appreciate the usefulness of using the bearing of the slope.Figuring out your exact location is usually relatively simple: just look aroundand compare what you see with what is on a map. Sometimes this is not accurateenough, or there is just nothing much nearby to identify on the map. The usualsolution then is to get out the compass and to try for bearings on somelandscape features, or to get out your GPS device. This is orientation byinstrument. But before resorting to this, first study the map carefully to seeif there are any topographic features—even subtle ones—that you can associatewith the landscape around you. If you have been carefully observing your map andcomparing it with the landscape, and keeping track of your location on the map(continually orienting yourself), as we suggested in chapter 1[part0008.html#7K4G0-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5], you should always have afairly good idea of where you are. Orientation by instrument should be reservedfor those situations in which nothing else works, for compass practice, or forverifying your location after using other methods.The goal of orientation is to determine that precise point on Earth’s surfacewhere you now stand. You can represent your position by a mere dot on the map.This is known as point position.There are two lower levels of orientation. One is called line position: you knowyou are along a certain line on a map—such as a river, a trail, a ridge, acompass bearing, or a contour line—but you do not know where you are along thatline.The lowest level of orientation is area position: you know the general area youare in, but that is all. The objective of orientation is to determine your exactpoint position.POINT POSITIONWith point position known, you know exactly where you are, and you can use thatknowledge to identify, on the map, any major feature that you can see in thelandscape. You can also identify in the landscape any major visible feature thatis shown on the map. Knowing your point position is an essential first step innavigation (see chapter 4[part0011.html#AFM60-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5]).images [../images/00030.jpeg]Figure 23. Example of point positionimages [../images/00031.jpeg]Figure 24. Orientation with line position known (magnetic needle omitted forclarity)Suppose you have hiked to the summit of Blue Mountain (figure 23[part0010.html#fig23]). You know your point position: the top of Blue Mountain.You see an unknown peak and want to know what it is. You take a compass bearingon it and get 232°. You plot 232° from Blue Mountain on your map, and theplotted line passes through Green Mountain. The unknown peak is Green Mountain.However, if you start by wanting to determine which of the many peaks around youis Green Mountain, you must do the map work first. You measure the bearing onthe map from where you are, Blue Mountain, to Green Mountain, and get 232°.Keeping the 232° at the index line, the entire compass is turned until theneedle is boxed. The direction-of-travel line then points toward Green Mountain.LINE POSITIONWith line position known, the goal is to determine point position. If you knowthat you are on a trail, a ridge, or some other easily identifiable line, youneed only one more trustworthy piece of information to get your point position.Example: Suppose a party of scramblers is on Unsavory Ridge (figure 24[part0010.html#fig24]), but they do not know exactly where they are on theridge. In the distance is Mount Majestic. A bearing on it indicates 218°. Theyplot 218° from Mount Majestic on the map, and run this line back toward UnsavoryRidge. Where it intersects the ridge is where the scramblers are.AREA POSITIONIf you only know your general area, you need at least two trustworthy pieces ofinformation to determine your point position.Example: Suppose some snowshoers know they are in the general area of FantasticCrags (figure 25 [part0010.html#fig25]), their area position. They want todetermine line position and then, from that, point position. They may be able touse bearings on two known, recognizable features. They take a bearing onFantastic Peak and get a reading of 38°. They plot a line on the map, along thebaseplate and through Fantastic Peak, at 38°. They know they must be somewhereon or near that bearing line, so they now have line position. They can also seeUnsavory Spire. A bearing on the spire shows 130°. They plot this line on themap, through Unsavory Spire, and draw a line along the baseplate. The twobearing lines intersect, and that is their location—or approximately so.images [../images/00032.jpeg]Figure 25. Orientation with area position known (magnetic needle omitted forclarity)Whenever you take a bearing in the field or plot a bearing on a map, it isinevitable that minor errors will creep in to create larger errors in theestimate of your position. It is very easy to make an error of 3° in taking abearing, and another 2° in plotting that bearing, unless you are extremelycareful. For every 5° of error, your position will be in error by about 460 feetin every mile (about 90 meters in every kilometer). If you take and plot abearing on a landmark 3 miles (5 km) away, and make a 5° error, the plotted linecould be about 1400 feet (430 m) away from the correct position. Therefore, besure that your conclusions agree with common sense. If you take and plotbearings from two peaks and find that the two lines intersect in the middle of ariver, but you are standing on a high point of land, something is wrong. Tryagain. Try to take a more accurate bearing, and plot it more carefully. Ifbearing lines intersect at a map location with no similarity to the terrain, youmay have errors in your bearings. Or there might be some magnetic anomaly in therocks, or you might have an inaccurate map. And who knows? Maybe those peaks arenot really the peaks you think they are. Make sure that the two bearings are notfrom approximately the same direction, since this can compound any error. Thecloser an angle of intersection is to 90°, the more accurate the point positionwill be.images [../images/00033.jpeg]Figure 26. Plotting three bearings results in a “cocked hat\" position.images [../images/00034.jpeg]Figure 27. Using a compass to orient a map in an area with 20 degrees eastdeclinationThe technique of taking and plotting bearings from landmarks is more accurate ifyou can see three landmarks and plot three bearings. The result will be a smalltriangle (called a “cocked hat,” see figure 26 [part0010.html#fig26]). Yourposition is most likely within this triangle.ORIENTING A MAPDuring a wilderness excursion it sometimes helps to hold the map in atraditional manner so that north on the map is pointed in the actual directionof true north. This is known as orienting the map, a good way to obtain a betterfeel of the relationship between the map and the countryside.One way to orient a map is by inspection: simply look at the terrain and compareit to the map. Then hold the map level and turn it until the map is lined upwith the terrain.Often, this technique will not work because you cannot see any identifiablefeatures around you. In this case, you can orient your map using your compass.Set 360° (North) at the index line of the compass and place your compass on themap. Put one long edge of the baseplate along the left or right edge of the mapas shown in figure 27 [part0010.html#fig27], with the N of the compass dialpointing to the direction of north on the map. Then hold the map level and turnthe map and compass together until the needle is boxed. The map is now orientedto the scene around you. (Map orientation can give you a general feel for thearea but cannot replace the more precise methods of orientation that we coveredin the preceding paragraphs.)DIRECTION AND BEARING OF THE SLOPEYou can often find your position by using the direction of the slope, which wasfirst described in chapter 1[part0008.html#7K4G0-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5] using general directionssuch as east or southwest. This technique can be refined by using the moreprecise bearing of the slope. For example, suppose you are hiking along thetrail near Maiden Peak (figure 28 [part0010.html#fig28]) and want to find yourpoint position. You take a bearing on Maiden Peak and get 242°. You plot thisbearing and find that it crosses the trail in two places, A and B. Where areyou? Points A and B are both on a ridge, but at point A the slope falls off tothe east, while at point B it falls off to the north. Suppose you take yourcompass and point it in the direction of the slope. You find that the actualslope falls off to the north. That tells you that you are at point B, not pointA.Sometimes the situation is a little more subtle, so we need more accuracy withthis approach. In this case, we refer to the bearing of the slope rather thanmerely its general direction. Imagine that another party is also on the MaidenPeak trail and wants to find its position. Some party members take a bearing onMaiden Peak and get 42°. They plot this line, as shown in figure 28[part0010.html#fig28], and they see that the bearing line crosses the trail inthree places. Where are they, point C, D, or E? A quick compass bearing showsthat the slope falls off roughly to the southeast, so point D is ruled out,since at that point the map clearly shows the slope to fall off to the east.That narrows it down to either point C or point E. A party member faces downhilland takes a more careful bearing in the direction of the fall line. Suppose thebearing is 140°. One long edge of the compass is then placed on the map at pointC, and the entire compass is rotated until the meridian lines in the compasshousing are parallel with the north–south lines on the map, with the N on thecompass dial toward the top of the map. The edge of the baseplate should thenpoint in a direction perpendicular to the contour lines at point C. However, youcan see that the bearing of 140° is not perpendicular to the contour lines atpoint C. So instead the same process can be repeated for point E. This time, thebearing line is nearly perpendicular to the contour lines, at least for thefirst 200 feet down from point E. From this, the party concludes that it is atpoint E.images [../images/00035.jpeg]Figure 28. Using the bearing of a slope to find your positionA REMINDERAt the beginning of this chapter we said that orientation by instrument shouldbe reserved for those situations in which nothing else works. The best method oforientation is to use your map and your continual observations of topography tokeep track of where you are. Presumably, at the beginning of your trek you knowwhere you are and can identify that position on the map. If you then follow yourprogress on the map, noting each topographic or other feature that you passalong the way, then at any time you should know your position with a greatamount of certainty. It is essential to know the technical methods of map andcompass orientation (and possibly GPS; see chapter 9[part0016.html#F8900-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5]), but there is still nosubstitute for continually keeping track of your position using the map(orientation).Once you have mastered the science of orientation and can determine exactlywhere you are, you are ready for navigation with map and compass.CHAPTER SUMMARYIn this chapter you learned about the importance of orientation by keeping trackof your position through awareness and observation. You also learned thedifference between point, line, and area position. Additionally, you learned howto orient a map with your surroundings and the usefulness of using the bearingof the slope for navigation.SKILLS CHECK•List two examples each of point, line, and area position.•Briefly describe the technique for measuring the bearing of a slope.PRACTICE PROBLEMSSee the appendix[part0019_split_000.html#I3QM0-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5] for probleminstructions.•Problems 8, 16, 19, 20, 23, 25, and 26 provide opportunities for you topractice the principles of orientation."},{"pageContent":"Chapter4Navigation with Map and CompassNow that you have learned the fundamentals of orientation, you can determineexactly where you are. You can then determine the direction to travel to get toyour desired destination: the process of navigation. This chapter will explain avariety of methods to do so.CHAPTER OBJECTIVES•Learn the principles of terrain navigation by following natural topographicfeatures.•Learn how to find the route to a distant objective using map and compass.•Follow a route using compass alone.•Make use of aiming off (an intentional offset).•Cope with the special problem of the parallel path.•Learn techniques for navigating around an obstruction.•Know the importance of maintaining awareness of where you are and where you areheaded.Getting from here to there is usually just a matter of keeping an eye on thelandscape and watching where you are going, helped by an occasional glance atthe map. However, if you cannot see your objective in the field, you can measurethe bearing on the map, then take compass in hand and follow thedirection-of-travel line as it guides you to the goal. This is navigation byinstrument. It is a technique that will work if you are able to follow astraight-line route, something often impossible in wilderness terrain. For thisreason, it is best to first try to follow trails or topographic features inwilderness navigation, and reserve navigation by instrument for those situationswhere the topography lacks sufficient features to be of any help to you.images [../images/00036.jpeg]Figure 29. Navigation using a map and compass (on A and B, magnetic needleomitted for clarity): A. measuring the bearing on the map from your position toyour destination, B. reading the bearing at the index line (leave the compassset), C. following the bearingNavigation by instrument is sometimes the only practical method for finding acrucial pass, base camp, or other goal. It also serves as a supplement to othermethods, such as following topographic features, and it can help to verify thatyou are on the right track. Again, use common sense and challenge a compassreading that defies reason. (Is your declination arrow or direction-of-travelline pointing the wrong way, sending you 180° off course?)MAP AND COMPASS NAVIGATIONThe most common situation requiring instrument navigation comes when the routeis unclear because the topography is featureless or because landmarks areobscured by forest or fog. You know exactly where you are and exactly where youwant to go, and you can identify both your present position and your destinationon the map. In this case, simply measure the bearing from your present positionto your objective on the map, and then follow that bearing to your objective.Example: Suppose you measure a bearing of 285° on the map (figure 29A[part0011.html#fig29]). Note that the north–south lines in the compass housingare parallel with the north–south lines on the map, with the N on the compassdial aligned with the top of the map. Read this bearing at the index line andleave it set there (figure 29B [part0011.html#fig29]). Then hold your compassout in front of you as you rotate your body until you have boxed the needle. Thedirection-of-travel line now points to your objective (figure 29C[part0011.html#fig29]). Start walking.COMPASS ALONENavigators of air and ocean often travel by instrument alone; you can too. Forexample, suppose you are scrambling toward a ridgetop and clouds begin toobscure your view. Just take a quick compass bearing on the destination beforeit disappears from view, then follow that bearing, compass in hand if you wish.You do not even have to note the numerical bearing; just box the needle and keepit boxed as you proceed to your objective. Likewise, if you are heading into avalley where fog or forest will hide your destination, take a bearing on thatgoal before you drop into the valley, and then follow that bearing after youlose sight of the objective (figure 30 [part0011.html#fig30]). This methodbecomes more reliable if several people travel together, checking each other’swork by taking occasional back bearings on each other.images [../images/00037.jpeg]Figure 30. Following a compass bearing when the view of the objective isobscured by forest or fogimages [../images/00038.jpeg]Figure 31. Use of intermediate objectives: A. in the forest, B. on a glacierUSING INTERMEDIATE OBJECTIVESA handy technique is available for those frustrating times when you try totravel exactly along a compass bearing but are frequently diverted byobstructions such as cliffs, dense brush, or crevasses. Try the technique ofintermediate objectives. If in a forest, sight past the obstruction to a tree orrock or other object that is exactly on the bearing line to the principalobjective (figure 31A [part0011.html#fig31]). Then you are free to travel overto the tree or rock by whatever route is easiest. When you get to theintermediate objective, you can be confident that you are still on the correctroute. This technique is useful even when there is no obstruction. Moving fromone intermediate objective to another means you can put the compass away forthose stretches, rather than having to hold it continually in your hand andcheck it every few steps.Sometimes on snow or glaciers, in fog, or in a forest where all the trees lookthe same, there may be no natural intermediate objectives. In this case, anothermember of the party can serve as the target (figure 31B [part0011.html#fig31]).Send that person out to near the limit of visibility or past the obstruction.Wave that person left or right until he or she is directly on the bearing line.That person can improve the accuracy of the route by taking a back bearing onyou.images [../images/00039.jpeg]Figure 32. Navigating to a specific point on a line: A. Inevitable minor errorscan sometimes have disastrous consequences. B. To avoid such problems, follow acourse with an intentional offset.THE INTENTIONAL OFFSET (“AIMING OFF”)Now imagine that your party is almost back to the car after a scramble. Youfollow a compass bearing to the logging road, but you cannot see the car becauseyou are off route by a few degrees. You have to guess which way to go. It is abad ending to the trip if the car is to the right and you go left. It will beeven worse if the car is parked at the end of the road, and a routefinding errortakes the party beyond that point and on and on through the woods (figure 32A[part0011.html#fig32]). The intentional offset (also called “aiming off”) wasinvented for this situation (figure 32B [part0011.html#fig32]). Just travel in adirection that is intentionally offset by 20° to 30° to the right or the left ofwherever you want to be. When you hit the road, there will be no doubt aboutwhich way to turn.THE PARALLEL PATHOne of the most vexing navigational problems can be the situation encounteredwhen traveling in a direction that parallels the direction of a road, trail, orother feature to which you must return in order to get back home. Such asituation is illustrated in figure 33 [part0011.html#fig33]. A party drivesalong a fairly straight road to its end, parks the car, and hikes to theobjective in a direction exactly parallel to the road. Both the road and theobjective are clearly visible on the map, so once at the objective the party canfollow the back bearing to the road end. When following this bearing back,however, it might not be possible to stay exactly on route, due toirregularities in the topography. Consequently, when the party nears the car, itmay have missed the end of the road and ended up in the woods to either theright or the left of the road.images [../images/00040.jpeg]Figure 33. Example of traveling on a path parallel to a road, trail, or otherline positionWith a little forethought, they could have avoided this situation by using avariation of the aiming-off technique. They could have purposely taken a route20° to 30° to the left or the right of the correct path, to a point safely pastthe end of the road. Once sure they were past this point, they could then turnsharply toward the road, and they would soon intersect it. A short hike up theroad would then lead them back to the car. The overall trip would be longer thanif they had taken a direct path, but the latter might have caused them to missthe road entirely.images [../images/00041.jpeg]Figure 34. Navigating around an obstruction when you can see across it once youare past itNAVIGATING AROUND AN OBSTRUCTIONSometimes you may try to follow a constant bearing to get to your objective butfind that the route is blocked by an obstruction such as a lake or a cliff.There may be an easy way to get around the obstruction, but doing so forces youoff your intended bearing. What do you do to stay on the correct bearing?If the obstruction is a lake or swamp, you may be able to see across it back toyour starting point after you have traveled past it (figure 34[part0011.html#fig34]). In this case, try to find some large, easily visibleobject on your bearing line before you start traveling past the obstruction. Ifthat point is a nondescript location with no identifiable landmark, you can markthis spot by building a pile of fallen logs or some other temporary landmarkthat you will be able to see from the other side of the obstruction. (See “Markthe Route If Necessary” in chapter 5[part0012.html#BE6O0-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5].) Once you know that youhave an identifiable object or marker along your bearing line, you can walkaround the obstruction using whatever route is easiest. Once past theobstruction, take a back bearing on your starting point. If this does not matchthe bearing of your intended direction of travel, then continue around theobstruction until your back bearing on the starting point does match yourintended direction of travel.If the obstruction is a cliff, a hill, or some other feature that prevents youfrom seeing your starting point once you have passed the obstruction, then youmay have to use a different technique, as shown in figure 35[part0011.html#fig35]. In this case, you can travel a paced distance at 90° tothe original course, then go past the blockage on a bearing parallel to theoriginal course, and finally return to the original course by another 90° coursechange paced the same distance as the earlier one but in the opposite direction.(The course change need not be 90°. It could be 45° or some other direction, aslong as it is easily possible to return to the original direction of travel.)images [../images/00042.jpeg]Figure 35. Navigating around an obstruction when the view across it is blockedALWAYS KEEP THE RETURN ROUTE IN MINDNo party should ever wander off on what may appear to be an obvious routewithout knowing the direction they are heading and considering how they willreturn.Example: Suppose that a party follows a trail to a camp in the forest (figure 36[part0011.html#fig36]). After eating dinner, they decide to hike off-trail to aclearly visible pass to see the view. After enjoying a memorable sunset at thepass, they turn around to return to camp. At that point it occurs to them thatthey cannot see their camp, do not know the direction to it, and will shortly berunning out of daylight. Is this a problem? It all depends on the preparationsthey made on the hike to the pass.If they had merely headed up to the pass without any thought of how they wouldget back, they might be in trouble. If, on the other hand, they had taken acompass bearing from their camp to the pass when they started their trek, thenonce at the pass they could simply follow a back bearing from the pass to returnto their camp in the forest. They could have also used route-marking materialsto mark the spot where they emerged from the forest. (If you do this, be sure toremove the marker once you no longer need it. Good wilderness travelers practiceLeave-No-Trace principles: take only pictures, leave only footprints.) Thesesimple measures could turn a potentially serious problem into a routineafter-dinner stroll.A REMINDERAt the start of this chapter we recommended using topographic features wheneverpossible in off-trail navigation, and reserving the use of navigation byinstrument only for those situations in which the topography lacks sufficientfeatures. Now, after describing eight different techniques used in off-trailnavigation, we are concerned that we may have distracted you from the originalpoint, so we will repeat it: Wherever possible, navigate by using trails andnatural topographic features, while keeping track of your position on the map.Reserve the use of navigation by instrument for those situations where there isno alternative.If you have thoroughly mastered the sciences of orientation and navigation, andkeep these principles in mind as you navigate toward your objective and back, itis unlikely that you will ever get lost.images [../images/00043.jpeg]Figure 36.

The focus of this chapter is to prevent you from getting lost, whichrequires a thorough knowledge of map, compass, orientation, and navigation.CHAPTER OBJECTIVES•Know how to avoid getting lost by identifying baselines, handrails, andpotential routefinding problems.•Learn steps you can take before and during the trip to ensure that you stay ontrack and do not get lost.•Know what to do if you ever do get lost.The primary focus of this book is to give you the necessary skills and knowledgeto avoid getting lost in the first place. Later in this chapter we will give yousome suggestions concerning what to do if you ever do get lost. But you shouldalways know where you are if you:•have carefully read and absorbed the preceding four chapters;•carry a topographic map of the area and a good compass;•have adequately practiced map reading, compass use, orientation, andnavigation; and•maintain orientation at all times, by keeping track of your position on the mapthroughout your trip.If so, you are not lost, and this entire subject may be only of academicinterest to you. In addition to the information provided in the first fourchapters, the information given in this chapter may go a long way towardpreventing you from ever getting lost in the first place.HOW TO AVOID GETTING LOSTYou can minimize your likelihood of getting lost with adequate planning beforeyou ever leave home and by taking certain precautions during the trip to yourdestination and on the return from it.Before the TripMost wilderness orientation, navigation, and routefinding is done by simplylooking at your surroundings and comparing them to the map. This process isoften aided by making some navigational preparations before the trip, likeidentifying handrails, baselines, and possible routefinding problems.A handrail is a linear feature on the map that you can follow, or it may be afeature that parallels the direction in which you are heading. The handrailshould be within frequent sight or sound (such as a noisy babbling brook) of theroute, so it can serve as an aid in navigation. Features that you can use ashandrails during a trip include:•Roads•Trails•Railroad tracks•Powerlines•Fences•Cliff bands•Borders of fields and meadows•Ridges•Valleys•Lakeshores•Edges of marshes•Rivers and streamsA baseline is a long, unmistakable line that always lies in the same directionfrom you, no matter where you are during the trip. Pick out a baseline on themap during trip planning. It does not have to be something you can see duringthe trip. You just have to know that it is there, in a consistent direction fromyou. A baseline (sometimes called a catch line) can be:•A road•An obvious trail•The shore of a large lake•A river or creek•A powerline•Any other feature that is at least as long as your trip areaIf the shore of a large distant lake always lies west of the area you will bein, you can be sure that heading west at any time will eventually get you tothis identifiable landmark. Heading toward this baseline may not be the fastestway to travel back home from your destination, but it may save you from beingtruly lost.Before the trip, it is wise to prepare a route plan: a well-thought-outdescription of how you will find your way to your destination and back,including handrails, baselines, trails, topographic features you will befollowing, and other aspects of your proposed wilderness trek. It is also a goodidea to highlight the entire trip on a topographic map.1.Identify handrails, baselines, and other features that you will be followingon the way to your objective. Part of this plan is to recognize potentialroutefinding problems. For example, if the route traverses a large, featurelessarea, you may need route-marking materials, particularly if the weather outlookis marginal. Be sure to carry such materials if your route plan indicates apossible need for them.2.Make a note of any escape routes that can be used in case of sudden badweather, injury, or other setbacks.3.If off-trail travel is involved, measure compass bearings at home before thetrip and write them down in a notebook or note them on the map. It is certainlypossible to measure map bearings at any point in the trip, but it is easier andsometimes more accurate at home on a desk or table, and it might save you timein an emergency.BASELINE NAVIGATION EXAMPLEA party once began a long scramble but was turned around due to bad weather.They started to drive home but had a flat tire on the way. While two partymembers changed the tire, the other passengers noticed some delicious ediblemushrooms alongside the road. A little exploration revealed that the deeper intothe woods they ventured, the more numerous and luscious the mushrooms became.They told the others, and after the tire was changed they all decided to dumptheir pack contents in the trunk of the car and head out into the woods to filltheir packs with mushrooms.After an hour or so, sunset approached and their packs were filled, but theparty had not paid any attention to where they had been going, had taken nocompass bearings, and had not followed any recognizable topographic features,since the terrain was forested, flat, and featureless. Was this a problem? Notreally. They knew that the road they were traveling ran almost true north–south(figure 37 [part0012.html#fig37]). They also knew that they had not crossed theroad, so they had to be on the east side of the road. Some party members hadtheir compasses in their pockets, so they could easily set their compasses on acourse due west. A short ramble in the woods brought them back to the road, andthey could see their car. This is a classic example of baseline navigation.images [../images/00044.jpeg]Figure 37. Example of baseline navigation4.Write down and discuss your route plan with other members of the party, so theparty is not solely dependent on one person for all route decisions. You mightconsider requiring all party members (or at least children or inexperiencedpersons) to carry whistles.5.Be sure to tell a responsible person where you are going, what route you aretaking, and when you plan on returning. This will not prevent you from gettinglost. But if you do run into trouble, the authorities will know to look for you,and where to look. This one bit of preparation could save your life. (It couldbe as easy as texting a friend while you are still within cell phone range, suchas “Day trip to Lk 22 with Dad and Ron. Silver Ford Fusion WA license SHWK12.Will text u when we return.” It could be more elaborate, such as marking a copyof a topo map with your planned route and emailing it to your responsibleperson, along with the trip schedule.)TIP: Be sure that you have the most recent road, trail, and avalanche conditionsand a weather forecast for your trip. Check online or at the local rangerstation for the latest information.Always make sure that every member of the party carries adequate food, clothing,and other supplies (see “Survival,” below). In the event of any emergency, eachperson should have:•enough food and clothing to survive several days, if necessary, while waitingfor search and rescue personnel to arrive; and•a map of the area and a compass, in case anyone becomes separated from the restof the group.Every wilderness excursion, no matter how simple, should have an agreed-uponturnaround time. If you have not reached your objective by this time, then youmust turn around to reach the trailhead or other starting point with adequatedaylight remaining. (Additional information on turnaround time for varioussituations is given in chapter 10[part0017.html#G6PI0-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5] of this book.)During the TripGet off on the right foot by making sure that everyone understands the route andthe route plan.•Gather the party around a map, and take time to discuss the route and to makecontingency plans in case the party becomes separated.•Point out on the map where you are, and associate your surroundings with thepiece of paper in front of you. This is a good time for everyone to make amental note of the main features—such as forests, streams, ridges, valleys,mountain peaks, and trails—they will see during the trip.Along the way, everyone needs to continue associating the terrain with the map.Ignorance of the territory is definitely not bliss for any daydreaming personwho becomes separated from the party. Whenever a new landmark appears, connectit with the map. At every chance—at a pass, in a clearing, or through a break inthe clouds—update your fix on the group’s exact position. Keeping track of yourprogress on the map makes it easy to plan each succeeding leg of the trip. Itmay also turn you into an expert map reader because you will quickly learn whata specific valley or ridge looks like compared to its representation on the map.Use handrails wherever possible. When the inevitable moment comes for you toleave the security of your handrail, such as a trail, make a mental note of thefact that you are leaving it, and ask yourself what you will be followinginstead—some topographic feature, a contour line, a compass bearing, or anythingelse you can count on. You should not merely press onward without a clear ideaof where you are headed or how to get back.Keep the party together, except perhaps on well-traveled, obvious trails. Allowparty members to travel at their own pace, but agree ahead of time to stop andregroup at certain bridges, stream crossings, and—most importantly—trailjunctions. Even then do not let the group get too spread out, and agree ahead oftime on places to stop and wait for everyone to catch up. If the group includeschildren or inexperienced persons, keep them in sight at all times.ASSIGN A SWEEPAssign a responsible, experienced person to be the rear guard, or “sweep,” toensure that no straggler will be left behind or lost.STAYING ORIENTED EN ROUTEYou can take several steps to stay oriented while on a wilderness trip.Look Ahead to the Return TripThe route always often looks different on the way back. Avoid surprises andconfusion by•glancing over your shoulder often and especially at route junctions on the wayin to see what the route should look like on the return.•jotting down times, elevations, landmarks, and so on in a small notebook, oreven in the margin of your map. A few cryptic words, such as “7600, hit ridge,”can save you a lot of grief on the return. It will remind you that when theparty has dropped to 7600 feet, it is time to leave the ridge and start down toyour starting point.ThinkYour brain is your most important navigational tool, a fact often overlookedamid our reliance on compasses, altimeters, GPS receivers, and other gadgets. Asthe party heads toward its destination, keep asking yourself questions:•How will we recognize this important spot on our return?•What would we do if the trip leader became unconscious? (Are we all relying onone person?)•Could I find my way back alone if I had to?•Would we be able to find our way back in a whiteout or if snow covered ourtracks?•Should we be marking the route right now?•How are we doing with regard to the previously agreed-upon turnaround time?Ask the questions as you go, and act on your answers. Make decisions for you andyour team before weather, route, time, and terrain make the decisions for you.Mark the Route If NecessaryThere are times when it may be best to mark the route going in so you can findit again on the way out. This situation can occur when:images [../images/00045.jpeg]Figure 38. Rock cairn•the route passes over snowfields or glaciers during changeable weather,•in heavy forest, or•when fog threatens to hide landmarks.On snow, climbers use thin bamboo wands with little flags to mark the path (see“Wands” in chapter 10 [part0017.html#G6PI0-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5]).In wooded areas, you can create temporary markers out of natural materials suchas downed branches or logs. For example, at a trail junction, you can arrangebranches in the shape of an arrow to point the way to the correct route, or inthe shape of an “X” across the trail to indicate the incorrect route.In the forest, plastic surveyor’s tape is sometimes tied to branches to show theroute, but we strongly discourage its use due to its permanence, since we alwaysendeavor to leave no trace.From an ecological standpoint, toilet paper is the best marker, because it willdisintegrate during the next rainfall. Use a small streamer of toilet paper ifyou are assured of good weather. If not, use brightly colored crepe paper inthin rolls. It will survive the next storm, but it will most likely disintegrateduring the winter.If you leave any route markers, be sure to remove your markers on the returntrip. Markers are litter, and good wilderness travelers never, ever litter. Ifthere is any chance that you will not come back the same way and will not beable to remove the markers, be especially sure to use biodegradable markers, ifany.Rock cairns (figure 38 [part0012.html#fig38]) appear here and there as markers,sometimes dotting an entire route and at other times signaling the point where aroute changes direction. These heaps of rock are another imposition on thelandscape, and they can create confusion for any traveler but the one who putthem together—so do not build them. If there ever comes a time when you decideyou must, then do so, but be sure to tear them down on the way out. The rule isdifferent, however, for existing cairns. Leave them alone, on the assumptionthat someone else may be depending on them. Your goal should be to leave thelandscape exactly as you found it.Keep TrackAs the trip goes on, it may be helpful to mark your progress on the map. Keepyourself oriented so that at any time you can point out your actual position towithin about half a mile (roughly 1 kilometer) on the map.Part of keeping track is having a sense of your speed. Given all the variables,will it take your party one hour to travel 2 miles, or will it take two hours totravel 1 mile? The answer is important if it is 3:00 p.m. and base camp is still5 miles away. After enough trips into the wilds, you will be good at estimatingtravel speeds. Here are some typical speeds for an average party, though therewill be much variation:•Hiking on a gentle trail, with a day pack: 2 to 3 miles (3 to 5 km) per hour•Climbing up a steep trail, with a full overnight pack: 1 to 2 miles (1.5 to 3km) per hour•Traveling up a moderate slope, with a day pack: 1000 feet (about 300 meters) ofelevation gain per hour•Traveling up a moderate slope, with a full overnight pack: 500 feet (about 150meters) of elevation gain per hourIn heavy brush, your rate of travel can drop to a third or even a quarter ofwhat it would be on a good trail. Above about 10,000 feet (about 3000 m), yourrate of travel will also greatly decrease, perhaps to as little as a hundredfeet (30 m) of elevation gain per hour, depending on your condition and yourstate of acclimatization.On the descent if the terrain is easy, such as on a good trail or a snowfield,your rate of progress can be as much as twice the speed as on the ascent.With a watch and a notebook (or a really good memory), you can monitor your rateof progress on any outing. Always make sure to note your starting time as wellas the times you reach important streams, ridges, trail junctions, and otherpoints along the route.Experienced wilderness travelers regularly assess their party’s progress andcompare it with the route plan and the turnaround time. Estimate and re-estimatewhen you will reach your destination and when you will return to your base campor starting point. If it begins to look as though your party could becometrapped in tricky terrain during darkness, you may discuss the situation withother members of your party and decide to change your plans and bivouac in asafe place or call it a day and return home.The Return TripAt your destination: This is your golden opportunity to rest, relax, andenjoy—and to learn more about the area and about map reading by comparing theactual view with the way it looks on the map. Your destination is also the placeto lay final plans for the return, a journey often responsible for many moreroutefinding problems than the way in.•Repeat the trailhead get-together by discussing the route plan and emergencystrategies with everyone.•Stress the importance of keeping the party together on the return. Invariably,some will want to race ahead while others lag behind.The return trip is a time for extra caution as you fight fatigue andinattention. As on the trip in, everyone needs to maintain a good sense of theroute and how it relates to the map. For a safe trip out,•stay together,•do not rush, and•be even more careful if you are taking a different return route.After the TripBack home while the details are fresh in your mind, write a detailed descriptionof the route and any problems, mistakes, or unusual features. Imagine what youwould like to know if you were about to do the trip for the first time, so youwill be ready with the right answers when another person asks about it. If aguidebook was confusing or wrong, take the time to write to the publisher.WHAT IF YOU DO GET LOST?Good wilderness travelers are rarely truly lost—but having learned humilitythrough years of experience, they always carry enough food, clothing, andbivouac gear to get them through hours or even days of temporary confusion.What If Your Party Is Lost?The first rule is to stop. In fact, even if you think you may not be where youshould be, stop!•Resist the temptation to press onward. The moment you are ever unsure of yourposition, you should stop.•Try to determine where you are. Methods of orientation are given in chapter 3[part0010.html#9H5K0-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5].•Keep your wits about you and do not forget what you have learned about mapreading and using the compass, as explained in chapters 1[part0008.html#7K4G0-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5] and 2[part0009.html#8IL20-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5].•Study the shape of the terrain and try to associate it with the map to find outwhere you are.•Remember the technique of the bearing of the slope as explained in Chapter 3[part0010.html#9H5K0-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5]. Take a bearing on thefall line and try to associate it with your position by studying the map.If these suggestions do not work, then try to decide the last time the group didknow its exact location. If that spot is fairly close, within an hour or so,retrace your steps and get back on route. But if that spot is hours back, youmight instead decide to head toward the baseline. If it begins to look as thoughdarkness will fall before you can get back, you might have to bivouac for thenight. If so, start looking for an adequate place, with water and some sort ofshelter if possible, well before dark.Being lost in a party is bad enough, but it is even worse when an individual isalone and separated from the rest of the party. For this reason, always keep theparty together, and assign a rear guard to keep track of any stragglers. If youever notice that someone is missing, the entire party should stop, staytogether, shout, whistle, and listen for answering sounds.What If You Are Lost Alone?Again, the first rule is to stop. Look around for other members of the party,shout, and listen for answering shouts. Sound your whistle if you have one. Ifthe only answer is silence, sit down, calm down, and combat terror with reason.One of the greatest dangers of being lost is panic, which can lead to makingunwise and nonsensical decisions. Once you have calmed down, start doing theright things.1.Look at your map in an attempt to determine your location, and plan a routehome in case you do not connect with the rest of the party.2.Mark your location with branches, a cairn, or other objects (see “Mark theRoute If Necessary” above), and then scout in all directions, each timereturning to your marked position.3.Well before dark, prepare for the night by finding water and shelter. Stayingbusy will raise your spirits.4.Try singing (no matter how bad a singer you are) so you will have something todo and searchers will have something to hear.DON’T COUNT ON MOBILE PHONESIt might be a good idea to carry a cell or smart phone into the wilderness foran added level of safety. You must be aware, however, that such phones do notwork in all terrain or in all locations. They must be able to transmit andreceive signals to and from the nearest cell tower, which might be out of rangeor blocked by mountains or other topographic features. Coverage in a remote areamay depend on your particular service provider.The GPS app on your smart phone might give you your point position, but in theabsence of a detailed digital map (which must be downloaded prior to your trip),you must verify that position on a paper map. Even more importantly, batterylife is limited unless you carry extra batteries or some charging device.Therefore, you should never trust a cell phone to be a dependable way of beingrescued if you are injured or lost. Consider cell and smart phones to beunreliable luxuries.The odds are that you will be reunited with your group by morning. If not, fightpanic. After a night alone, you may decide to hike out to a baseline feature—aridge or stream or highway—that you picked out before the trip. If the terrainis too difficult to travel alone, it might be better to concentrate on lettingyourself be found. It is far easier for rescuers to find a lost person who staysin one place in the open, sounds a whistle, and shouts periodically, than onewho thrashes on in hysterical hope, one step ahead of the rescue party.The decision whether to forge ahead or to stay put is strongly influenced bywhether or not anyone knows that you are missing and where to look for you. Ifyou are traveling alone, or if your entire party is lost, and no one knows youare missing or where you had planned to go, you have no choice but to try tofind your way back, even if this involves difficult travel. If, on the otherhand, someone responsible expects you back at a certain time and knows where youwere planning to go and what route you planned to take, then you have the optionof staying put, making yourself visible, and concentrating on survival whilewaiting for a search party to find you.SURVIVALYour chances for survival depend on how well equipped you are. Numerous storiesof survival and tragedy start with statements such as, “I was sure glad I had my______,” or “Too bad they did not bring a ______.” Over the years these crucialitems of gear have developed into a codified list known as The Ten Essentials: ASystems Approach.1.Navigation system: This contains, at a minimum, a topographic map of the areaand a compass. It might also include an altimeter, a GPS receiver, a whistle,and route-marking materials.2.Sun protection: Sunglasses and sunscreen.3.Insulation: Enough extra clothing to survive the most severe night that youcan expect in the area you will be visiting.4.Illumination system: A flashlight or headlamp, plus spare batteries and aspare bulb.5.First-aid supplies: Including any prescription medications that you take on adaily basis, in case you do not make it back home in time for the next dose.6.Fire system: Matches in a waterproof case and firestarter.7.Repair kit and tools: At a minimum, a good, multibladed knife. Add other toolsdepending on what equipment you might need to maintain.8.Nutrition: In addition to snacks, carry enough extra food to survive for atleast an additional day more than planned.9.Hydration system: Adequate water plus some water purification method.10.Emergency shelter: A plastic tube tent, for example.Always consider the possibility that one member of your party might becomeseparated from the rest of the group and will depend totally on his or her ownequipment and skill for survival. It is therefore essential that all personscarry adequate food and equipment. It is equally important that all persons inthe party have the knowledge and skill to use all the necessary equipment(including the map and compass), rather than always relying on the skills ofanother. If someone gets lost, having the proper equipment and skills may makethe difference between tragedy and a graceful recovery from the experience.To Sum It UpIt is important to be prepared for unforeseen emergencies such as gettinginjured or lost, and to have all the equipment and training necessary to survivesuch an experience. But it is even better to learn the tools of navigation,particularly the map and compass, to avoid getting into such a situation in thefirst place.CHAPTER SUMMARYIn this chapter you learned about trip planning and keeping track of yourposition on the map to ensure that you do not get lost. Additionally, youlearned the importance of telling someone responsible where you are going andkeeping the party together. Finally, you learned about the gear and a fewtechniques for getting yourself back on track if you ever do get lost.SKILLS CHECK•List three ways to prepare for navigating a trip in the wilderness.•What essential step should you take before every wilderness trip?•List three things you should do on the trip itself to avoid getting lost.•If you think you might be lost, the first thing you should do is ________.(Hint: this is a four-letter word.)•List three steps you should take if your party is lost."},{"pageContent":"Chapter6More about MapsCHAPTER OBJECTIVES•Explain the latitude/longitude coordinate system.•Describe the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate system.•Discuss other coordinate systems: MGRS and Maidenhead.•Describe the range, township, and section method of land survey.•Show how to measure distance on maps.•Explain how to use pace on wilderness excursions.•Describe how to measure slope on maps.USING THE LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE COORDINATE SYSTEMThis familiar system is used, along with UTM, on USGS topographic maps. Only thelatitude and longitude (lat/long) system, however, is used on marine charts.Therefore, whereas the land traveler has a choice of using either lat/long orUTM, the nautical traveler using marine charts must know the lat/long system.Latitude is measured from 0° to 90°, both north and south, from the equator.Longitude is measured from 0° to 180°, both east and west, from the Greenwichmeridian, which runs through the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, near London,England. A latitude of north 47°, 12 minutes, and 41.3 seconds would be writtenN47°12'41.3\". This is referred to as the “degrees, minutes, and seconds,” or“hddd.mm.ss.s,” coordinate system. The “h” defines the hemisphere (i.e., N fornorth or S for south latitude, and E for east and W for west longitude). Othervariations of this system are degrees, minutes, and decimal minutes(hddd.mm.mmm, such as N47°12.6883’), and degrees and decimal degrees(hddd.ddddd, such as N47.2115°). The latter is frequently used bysearch-and-rescue (SAR) groups.images [../images/00046.jpeg]Figure 39. Marine navigation chart showing latitude and longitude coordinatesRELATING LAT/LONG TO MEASUREMENT UNITSOne useful feature of the lat/long system is that one minute of latitude isequal to one nautical mile, which is 6076 feet or 1852 meters. Since there are60 seconds in a minute, this means that one second of latitude is equivalent to101 feet, or 34 yards, or 31 meters. These numbers are often helpful inidentifying your position on a topographic map or nautical chart.The choice of which system to use is often made by looking at the system used onthe particular map or marine chart you are using. In figure 39[part0013.html#fig39], for example, latitude is shown along the left and rightedges of the chart, and longitude is shown along the top and bottom. Note thateach minute of latitude and longitude is divided into 10 small divisions. Sinceone minute equals 60 seconds, the smallest division is therefore 6 seconds (0.10minute) on this chart. (This relationship is valid for charts with a scale of1:80,000, a commonly used scale in many areas. However, many different scalesare used on marine charts, so the number of seconds or minutes for the smallestdivision will vary from one chart to another with a different scale.)The position identified as “Northeast Pt.” in figure 39 [part0013.html#fig39]has north latitude 49°, 42 minutes, and 36 seconds (N49°42'36\") and longitudeW124°21'24\". You can easily find these coordinates by drawing horizontal andvertical lines through the point of interest to the edges of the chart, asshown. The numbers are interpolated from where these lines intersect the scaleson the edges of the chart.SETTING A GPS UNIT TO THE DESIRED COORDINATE SYSTEMWhen using a GPS receiver, it is possible to set its coordinate system to eitherlat/long or UTM. If you are using lat/long, you can then set the display todegrees, minutes, and seconds, or to degrees and decimal degrees, or to degrees,minutes, and decimal minutes in order to match your paper map. This is normallydone by using the receiver’s “settings” screen. Further details on this subjectare given in chapter 9 [part0016.html#F8900-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5].It is easier to interpolate between marked divisions if you use degrees,minutes, and decimal minutes. In the above example, since each minute is dividedinto 10 subdivisions, the smallest division equals 0.10 minute. The pointdescribed in this example is seen to have latitude N49°42.6' and longitudeW124°21.4'.USING THE UTM COORDINATE SYSTEMThe Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) system is a grid of north–south andeast–west lines at intervals of 1000 meters (3281 feet or 0.6214 mile), as shownin figure 40 [part0013.html#fig40], which shows the lower left-hand corner of atypical USGS topographical map. Measurements in the north–south direction arecalled northings, and measurements east and west are called eastings. This isfar more precise for USGS topo maps than the lat/long system, because USGS mapsonly identify latitude and longitude coordinates every 2.5 minutes(approximately 2 to 3 miles or 3 to 5 kilometers). Without using a scale orruler, you can usually “eyeball” your position to within about 100 meters (about300 feet) using UTM, which is often close enough to at least get to within sightof your objective. If greater precision is desired, you can use the meters scaleat the bottom of the map, or special map measurement tools.images [../images/00047.jpeg]Figure 40. Lower left corner of a USGS topographic map showing UTM zone andhorizontal datum; UTM partial eastings and northings also shownMETRIC CONVERSIONSFor most practical purposes, you can think of a meter as being approximatelyequal to a yard. Actually, 1 yard (36 inches) is equal to 0.9144 meter, and 1meter equals 1.094 yards. If you need to do exact conversions, 1 inch equals2.54 centimeters, and there are 100 centimeters in a meter and 1000 meters in 1kilometer (km). One km is the same as 0.6214 miles, and 1 mile equals 1.609 km.One meter equals 3.2808 feet, and 1 foot equals 0.3048 meters. (The latter twoconversions are printed at the bottom of some USGS maps.)A northing is the number of meters north or south of the equator. An easting isthe number of meters east or west of a certain reference line. This line isbased on the zone number and the datum. These important numbers are shown in thelower left corner of the map, as in figure 40 [part0013.html#fig40]. These willbe described in more detail later in this chapter, but at this point we wish togive a practical example so that you can appreciate how the system works.For example, suppose you are climbing toward Glacier Peak in Washington state,and clouds obscure all visibility. You reach a summit but are not sure whetherit is the true summit of Glacier Peak. You turn on your GPS receiver and let itacquire a position. The UTM numbers on the screen of your GPS receiver are asfollows:10 6 40 612E53 29 491NThe top number is the easting. The “10” is the UTM zone number. The numbers “640 612E” indicate that your position is 640,612 meters east of the referenceline for your zone. In figure 41 [part0013.html#fig41], you can find the number“6 40 000mE” along the top edge of the map. This is the full easting (except forthe zone number). To the right of this is the number 6 41. This is a partialeasting, with the “000” meters omitted. You can see that the number “10 6 40612E” on the screen of the GPS receiver is approximately six-tenths of the waybetween 6 40 000 and 6 41 000. Your east–west position is therefore aboutsix-tenths of the way between the 6 40 000 and the 6 41 lines. Your position issomewhere on a line running roughly through both Glacier Peak and DisappointmentPeak.images [../images/00048.jpeg]Figure 41. Close-up of USGS topographic map showing Glacier Peak summit areaAlong the left edge of the map shown in figure 41 [part0013.html#fig41] is thenumber “53 31 000mN.” This is the full northing, which indicates that this pointis 5,331,000 meters north of the equator. Below this is a line labeled “53 30,”and another labeled “53 29.” These are partial northings, with the “000” metersomitted. The second set of numbers displayed on the GPS receiver is 53 29 491N.This is a horizontal line about halfway between 53 29 and 53 30. The point wherethe easting and the northing lines intersect is your point position. Findingthis point in figure 41 [part0013.html#fig41] shows that you are onDisappointment Peak. (Sorry; keep climbing.)images [../images/00049.jpeg]Figure 42. An example of a plastic scale to measure UTM positionIf you have difficulty “eyeballing” distances between UTM coordinate lines,there are special rulers and other measuring devices that you can use instead.You can purchase special plastic scales to read UTM coordinates on1:24,000-scale (7.5-minute) maps (see figure 42 [part0013.html#fig42]), thoughthis requires carrying one more piece of special equipment. Some compasses areequipped with special scales to locate your position on maps; some of these have“GPS” in their model numbers. Other compasses have “roamer” (sometimes spelled“romer”) scales for use with either 1:24,000- or 1:50,000-scale maps. Thecompass shown in figure 43 [part0013.html#fig43], for example, has roamer scalesfor 1:25,000- and 1:50,000- scale maps, as used on metric maps. A similarcompass made for use in the United States would have roamers for 1:24,000- and1:63,360- scale maps.images [../images/00050.jpeg]Figure 43. An example of a compass with roamer scalesYou can make a homemade scale by photocopying the meters scale at the bottom ofa USGS topo map, cutting out the desired scale, and gluing it to a piece ofheavy paper (see figure 44 [part0013.html#fig44]).Any of these techniques will allow you to get better accuracy than merely“eyeballing” the map.images [../images/00051.jpeg]Figure 44. Homemade map distance scaleNAVIGATION USING GPS AND UTM COORDINATESSuppose that you can identify your desired destination on the map but cannotactually see it in the field. You can then read the UTM position of thedestination off the map and enter it into your GPS memory as a waypoint. You canthen get the GPS receiver to tell you the distance and direction to that place.Going back to the Glacier Peak example shown in figure 41 [part0013.html#fig41],suppose you wish to find the route from wherever you are to the summit ofGlacier Peak. From the map, you can see that the summit of Glacier Peak is abouthalfway between the eastings of 6 40 000 and 6 41 000, so you could estimate theeasting as 10 6 40 500 (the zone number is still 10). You can also see that thesummit is about three-tenths of the way between the northings of 53 30 000 and53 31 000, so you can estimate the full northing to be 53 30 300N. You can nowenter the UTM coordinates of 10 6 40 500E and 53 30 300N into your GPS receiver.Navigation using GPS, map, and compass is discussed more thoroughly in chapter 9[part0016.html#F8900-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5].DATUM, ZONE, AND LATITUDE BANDSA datum is a point of reference used by mapmakers, surveyors, and GPS devicemanufacturers, upon which to base position coordinates. The most recenthorizontal datum, the one used by the Global Positioning System, is denoted asWGS84 (World Geodetic System, 1984). This is most GPS receivers’ default datumand is appropriate for most USGS topographic maps being produced today.Older datums are used on many other maps (including many USGS maps printed up tonearly the present time), such as NAD27 CONUS (North American Datum 1927 for theContinental United States), NAD27 Alaska, NAD27 Canada, NAD83, and others. Thedatum is usually printed in the lower left-hand corner of the map (see figure 40[part0013.html#fig40], in which NAD27 is identified as the map’s horizontaldatum).Before you use a GPS receiver with any topo map, you must first find the map’sdatum, and go to the receiver’s setup or settings screen to get a list of allits available map datums. Then select the datum that agrees with the map’sdatum. Failure to use the proper datum can result in errors of as much asseveral hundred meters or yards.The UTM zone is usually printed on USGS maps (see figure 40[part0013.html#fig40], for zone 10). There are 60 zones, and each is 6° wide.Zone 1 is for the area from 180° W longitude to 174° W, and its zone meridian(centerline) is 177° W. Zone 2 is from 174° W to 168° W longitude, with a zonemeridian of 171° W, and so on. The centerline of each zone is numbered 5 00000mE. This line is the reference for UTM eastings.Some GPS receivers use a latitude band letter with UTM to indicate positionrelative to the equator. This system divides Earth into 8°-wide latitude bandsfrom 80° S latitude to 84° N latitude (the northernmost band being a bit widerthan the others). The bands are lettered from south to north, according to thefollowing table:Table 5. Latitude Bands and Latitude Rangesimages [../images/00052.jpeg]If the latitude band is used, the letter for that band is placed immediatelyafter the zone number, such as 10T 05 46 379. Some GPS receivers require usingsuch a latitude band. Others merely ask you to indicate which hemisphere you arein, north or south.Due to distortion of the UTM grid lines near the poles, UTM is not defined northof N84° or south of S80° latitude.CONVERTING BETWEEN LAT/LONG AND UTMIf you ever need to convert from one of these systems to another, you can entercoordinates in one system into a GPS receiver, then change its settings to theother desired system, and the receiver will make the conversion for you. Withouta GPS receiver, you can find coordinate conversion websites on the internet byentering “lat/long to UTM convert” into the search engine of your choice. Twosuch sites are www.earthpoint.us/Convert.aspx[http://www.earthpoint.us/Convert.aspx] and www.ngs.noaa.gov/TOOLS/utm.shtml[http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/TOOLS/utm.shtml].OTHER COORDINATE SYSTEMSThe area covered by UTM includes most of the world except Antarctica and arcticregions north of Alaska’s north coast. In those areas you can use the lat/longgrid or the UPS grid instead.The Universal Polar Stereographic (UPS) grid is very similar to the UTM grid, inthat it expresses locations with a grid of 1-kilometer squares, and eastings andnorthings expressed in meters, just as with UTM. Some GPS receivers have asingle setting for both, such as “UTM/UPS” or “UTM UPS.” The zone number isalways zero for the UPS grid. The latitude band letters are A or B for theAntarctic region, and Y and Z for the arctic region. Most GPS devicesautomatically switch from UTM to UPS when traveling north of N84° or south ofS80°.Since nautical charts and USGS topographic maps only use latitude/longitude andUTM or UPS, those systems are all that you need to know for wilderness travel.But in case you wonder what some of the other systems referred to on GPSreceivers are, we will briefly mention three additional systems.The Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) is used by the US military. It isessentially the same as the UTM system, except that some of the leading UTMnumbers are replaced by letters. The last five digits of the MGRS easting andnorthing are the same as for UTM. For example, if your UTM location is 10T 0471523E and 53 07108N, your MRGS location is expressed as 10T DJ 71523 and 07108.Note that the “71523” and the “07108” are the same in each system. The onlydifference is that the first two digits of the UTM easting and northing arereplaced by letters.images [../images/00053.jpeg]Figure 45. A township consists of a square 6 miles on a side that contains 36sections. Each side of each section is one mile.MGRS Polar is similar to the UPS grid, based on a grid of 1-kilometer squaresfor the polar areas outside the area of coverage for MGRS.Maidenhead is a grid used by amateur radio operators, based on 1-kilometersquares just as the UTM system. For the location in the paragraph above, theMaidenhead coordinates are given by CN87HW.RANGE, TOWNSHIP, AND SECTIONThe primary surveying system used in most parts of the United States is theRange, Township, and Section system. In this system, most of the United Statesis divided into regions called townships. This system is used in all the stateswest of the Mississippi River (except for Texas), as well as in Minnesota,Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida.images [../images/00054.jpeg]Figure 46. Marker on the Willamette Stone near Portland, Oregon, the center ofthe range, township, and section system of land surveying in Oregon andWashingtonA township is a 36-square-mile area. The township is divided into 36one-square-mile sections. The sections are numbered from 1 to 36 in a zigzagpattern starting at the northeast corner of the township (see figure 45[part0013.html#fig45]).Each section is divided into quarter-sections, such as the “northeast quarter ofsection 23.” If necessary, these quarter-sections are sometimes furthersubdivided, such as “the southeast quarter of the northwest quarter of section23” of a particular township. In this way, a certain location can be pinpointedto within a quarter of a mile. This method is often used to define propertyboundaries.Each township is identified by its location with respect to a baseline and ameridian in a local coordinate system.One example is the Willamette Baseline and the Principal Willamette Meridian,whose intersection is located in Willamette Stone State Park near Portland,Oregon (see figure 46 [part0013.html#fig46]). This point is used as the basis ofthe range, township, and section system throughout the states of Washington andOregon. The location of each township in these states is referred to by itsdistance from the intersection of the Principal Willamette Meridian (anorth–south line) and the Willamette Baseline (an east–west line; see figure 47[part0013.html#fig47]). A township whose northern boundary is three townships(18 miles) north of the Willamette Baseline is identified as T3N. If this area’seastern boundary is 30 miles east of the Principal Willamette Meridian, thetownship is identified as R5E. If a specific location within this township is inSection 23, it is identified as Section 23, Township 3N, Range 5E, or Section23, T3N, R5E.images [../images/00055.jpeg]Figure 47. In the states of Washington and Oregon, township line boundaries aredefined based on their distance north or south of the Willamette Baseline. Rangeline boundaries are defined based on their distance east or west of thePrincipal Willamette Meridian. These lines intersect just west of Portland inWillamette Stone State Park.images [../images/00056.jpeg]Figure 48. A portion of a USGS topographic map, showing section, range, andtownship numbers and boundariesIn locations where the land has been surveyed using this method, the boundariesbetween sections, townships, and ranges are usually indicated by light red lineson USGS topographic maps. The township and range boundaries are shown by redletters and numbers such as R5E or T6N near the edges of the maps. The sectionsare numbered from 1 to 36 with red numbers in the centers of the sections. Infigure 48 [part0013.html#fig48], for example, the hill indicated by A is inSection 36, T15N, R6E. Big Creek Campground (indicated by B) is in Section 6,T14N, R7E.Some areas in the United States have not yet been surveyed. In these areas, therange, township, section system cannot be used. In this case, locations can bespecified using the lat/long system or the UTM system.Property surveys, timber sales, and some other forestry-related applicationsoften use the section, township, and range system, though this system is notavailable on all GPS receivers.DISTANCE MEASUREMENT ON A MAPYou can easily measure distances on a map using the scales at the bottom of it.To measure a straight-line distance, simply measure the length of the linejoining the two points of interest using a scale of your compass. Then transferthis distance to one of the scales at the bottom of the map and read off thenumber of feet, meters, kilometers, or miles. If the distance on the map isgreater than the length of your compass scale, or if the route is not a straightline, then you can instead use the lanyard attached to your compass. (If yourcompass does not have a lanyard, you can easily create one by tying a shoelaceor other cord to the compass through the hole made for the lanyard.) Put thefree end of the lanyard on one point on the map, then place the lanyard on theroute to be measured, curving it along the trail, ridge, or other feature, untilit reaches the other point on the map. Then straighten out the lanyard and placeit alongside the desired scale at the bottom of the map.While following trails with numerous short switchbacks, this method may beinaccurate, since the lanyard may not be able to keep up with all the tinyzigzags. In this case, your map measurement will at least give you a minimumdistance, which may be enough information for your purposes.Suppose you want to find the distance from Blue Lake to Johnson Mountain asshown in figure 49 [part0013.html#fig49]. You can measure the straight-linedistance from the lake’s outlet at its southwest tip to the summit of JohnsonMountain to find out how far a trip it would be. If you place the scale of yourcompass along this route, you can get a certain map distance, in inches,centimeters, or millimeters, whatever you prefer. Placing the compass along thescales at the bottom of the map shows that this corresponds to about 0.4 mile or2200 feet (0.7 kilometer or 700 meters). (Try it yourself, and see if youagree!)images [../images/00057.jpeg]Figure 49. Measuring distance and finding elevation gain from a topographic mapNote that there is a trail from Blue Lake to the summit of Johnson Mountain.Though the distance to the peak will be longer via the trail, the travel willmost certainly be easier. You can measure the distance along the trail byplacing the free end of the lanyard on the map at the outlet of Blue Lake, thencurving the lanyard along the trail until it reaches the summit of JohnsonMountain. Then straighten out the lanyard and place it alongside whatever scaleyou want to use at the bottom of the map. The distance corresponds to about 1.3miles or 7000 feet (2.1 km or 2100 m). Try it. Do you agree?You can use either feet and miles, or meters and kilometers for measuring orpacing distances. However, metric units are much easier to use, since you canmentally convert distances from kilometers to meters and vice versa, bymultiplying or dividing by 1000. Converting miles to feet or vice versa, on theother hand, requires multiplying or dividing by 5280 (the number of feet in amile), which can be time-consuming and cumbersome in the field.PACEIt is occasionally necessary to go a certain distance in a given direction, forexample, 300 feet (100 m) in a northeasterly direction. Doing this requires agood estimate of your pace. All wilderness travelers should have a rough idea ofthe length of their pace. The length of your normal pace is the distance youcover when you walk two steps (one step with each foot) on level ground at acomfortable walking stride. To measure your normal pace, establish a startingpoint where you will be able to walk in a straight line on level terrain. Walkfor 10 full paces (10 steps with each foot), and mark the place where youstopped. Then measure the distance you walked. Divide that distance by 10 to getthe length of your pace. For example, if the distance for 10 full paces is 50feet, then your pace is 5 feet. The normal pace for most people ranges from 3 to6 feet (about 1 to 2 meters).Once you know your pace, you can use it to travel a given distance in the field.Suppose you want to travel 1000 feet, and you know your pace is 5 feet. Divide1000 feet by 5 feet per pace, and the result is 200 paces. This sort ofcalculation is best done at home before the trip, as a part of preparing a routeplan, if done at all.TIP: When using the length of pace in your travels, keep in mind that youractual pace will vary considerably due to differences in terrain. For example,your pace will be shorter when going uphill or through heavy brush, and longerwhen descending a good trail. So whenever you use your pace in navigation, besure to make allowances for variations in the length of your pace with theterrain.Counting paces is a poor way to travel in the wilderness, since it is easy tolose count. If you concentrate hard enough to avoid losing count, you may missimportant details of the route, such as key topographic features, and it maydetract from your enjoyment of the trip. Keeping track of your location is farbetter achieved by watching the topography. If counting paces is necessary atall, we recommend that you use it only for short distances.SLOPE (GRADE) MEASUREMENT ON A MAPBy carefully measuring the distance between contour lines on a topographic map,you can estimate the steepness, or grade, of the slope as a percentage. We canfind the grade of the slope by finding the vertical distance, or elevation gain,divided by the horizontal distance, and multiplying the result by 100 percent.This knowledge is important in estimating the risk of avalanches (see “On Snow”in chapter 10 [part0017.html#G6PI0-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5]) and fordetermining the feasibility of a particular route. You can do this in the field,but it is easiest if done at home before your trip.In the example shown in figure 49 [part0013.html#fig49], we found thestraight-line distance from Blue Lake to Johnson Mountain to be about 2200 feet.The elevation of Johnson Mountain is 6721 feet (as shown on the map), and theelevation of Blue Lake is 5625 feet. Subtracting 5625 from 6721 gives anelevation gain of 1096 feet. If you were to travel in a straight line from BlueLake to Johnson Mountain, the grade of the slope would be the elevation gain(1096 feet) divided by the horizontal distance (2200 feet), multiplied by 100percent. This gives a grade of about 50 percent, which is a very steep grade;traveling along this route will be difficult and possibly dangerous. Note alsothat this 50 percent is merely an average grade. The first 200 feet of gain willbe rather gentle, but the next 400 feet will be steeper, as can be inferred fromthe closer contour lines. Above 6200 feet, the slope eases up somewhat. Sincethe average grade is 50 percent and some of the route has a lesser grade, it isapparent that the steepest grade along this route will be even more than 50percent.If you instead take the trail from Blue Lake to Johnson Mountain, the elevationgain is the same: 1096 feet. But the distance that you measured earlier usingthe lanyard of the compass was about 7000 feet. The average grade along thetrail is therefore 1096 divided by 7000, multiplied by 100 percent, or about 16percent. This is a much more reasonable grade than that of the straight-lineroute, and it will probably be an enjoyable hike rather than a difficult andpossibly dangerous climb.These examples illustrate how to find the average grade over some distance. Youcan also find the steepest grade along any route using a similar procedure. Drawa line on the map indicating your proposed route. Pick out the place on thisline that appears to be the steepest: the place where the contour lines areclosest together. Identify two particular contour lines in this area—forexample, two index contours (indicated by the heavier contour lines). Thedifference between these two lines is the vertical height of the slope. Nowmeasure the horizontal distance between these same two lines with the scale ofyour compass (or any other suitable device). Transfer this measurement to thefeet scale at the bottom of the map. Then you can find the steepest grade of theslope by making the same calculation as above.images [../images/00058.jpeg]Figure 50. Measuring grade on a mapIf you have a metric map, the contour interval will be in meters instead offeet. In this case, your horizontal distance must also be in meters. Usewhatever units you want, as long as you use the same units for both the verticaland the horizontal measurements.Figure 50 [part0013.html#fig50] shows several examples of measuring the grade ofthe slope. Points A and B are at elevations of 3600 and 3400 feet, so thevertical height is 3600 minus 3400, or 200 feet. The horizontal distance on themap, which can be measured with a ruler, is found to be 5 centimeters.Transferring this to the scale for feet at the bottom of the map gives adistance of 3800 feet. The grade is 200 feet divided by 3800 feet, multiplied by100 percent, or 0.05 multiplied by 100 percent, which equals 5 percent. This isa gentle slope.Points C and D are at elevations of 5000 feet and 4600 feet, so the verticalheight is 400 feet. The horizontal distance is 10 millimeters, which, whentransferred to the scale for feet, gives 800 feet. The grade is 400 feet dividedby 800 feet, multiplied by 100 percent, which equals 50 percent, a steep slope.A grade of 50 percent corresponds to approximately a 27° angle.Points E and F are at elevations of 4800 feet and 4200 feet. The vertical heightis 600 feet. The horizontal distance on the map is 8 millimeters, correspondingto a distance of 600 feet, which is the same as the vertical height of 600 feet.The grade is 100 percent—a 45° angle. This is a very steep slope. If thevertical height is equal to the horizontal distance, the grade is 100 percent,and the angle of the slope is 45°.Instead of measuring horizontal distances with a ruler, you can just as easilycalculate the distance by making two pencil marks on a scrap of paper,corresponding to the horizontal distance on the map between the two contourlines. Then move this paper alongside the appropriate scale at the bottom of themap to convert that distance to feet or meters.Measuring the grade of the slope is easy; it merely requires dividing thevertical height by the horizontal distance (sometimes called “rise over run”).But expressing the result as an angle, in degrees, requires the use oftrigonometry, which we would rather avoid in the field. For your information,the relationship between slope grade and slope angle is shown in table 6[part0013.html#tab6] below:Table 6. Slope Grade and Slope Angleimages [../images/00059.jpeg]You can use this table (or trigonometry if you know it) for trip planning athome, but in the field you usually only need to know a few values. A 20 percentgrade is representative of a reasonably steep trail, such as one that gainsabout 1000 feet in 1 mile. A 50 percent grade has an angle of 27°, and a 100percent grade has an angle of 45°. These three numbers can help you to determinethe feasibility of negotiating a particular slope and can also help you toassess the risk of avalanche hazard (see “On Snow” in chapter 10[part0017.html#G6PI0-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5]). A 50 percent grade is avery steep slope, well past the limit for hiking. Slopes steeper than 50 percentusually involve difficult scrambling or climbing. By the time the grade gets to100 percent, the terrain is usually too steep for unroped travel, and you willprobably need to belay for safety. On snow, you may need an ice ax even if thegrade is less than 30 percent.All wilderness travelers should know their limits when it comes to slope.Sometime when you are going up or down a slope that appears to be at your limit,and you feel uncomfortable about being on any steeper terrain, mark that spot onyour map. Once you get home, measure the grade of that slope for that locationon the map as mentioned above. Then you will know your limit, and the next timeyou contemplate a route in unfamiliar territory, you will be able to measure itsgrade on the map to find out if it is within your limits.CHAPTER SUMMARYIn this chapter, you have learned the details of the lat/long and UTM systems ofdefining positions on a map, as well as some basic aspects of other coordinatesystems.

The present chapter goes deeper into thesubject of geomagnetism and compass use, by providing detailed information oncompasses and geomagnetism.WHERE TO GET DECLINATION INFORMATIONTo find the declination for any point in the United States, call the USGS at303-273-8487. For Canada, call the Geological Survey of Canada at 613-837-4241.Declination information is also available on the internet. The National Oceanicand Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) website,www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag-web/#declination[http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag-web/#declination], provides declinationinformation for any place in the United States with only the postal ZIP code orthe latitude/longitude coordinates of the location. The latter can be found bylooking at any corner of a USGS topographic map for the area of interest. Thereare also drop-down menus for major cities in the United States and othercountries. In addition to giving the magnetic declination in degrees, thiswebsite provides the present amount of annual change in declination and providesdeclination maps of the world.DECLINATION OUTSIDE NORTH AMERICAOn the NOAA website, the default latitude and longitude are north latitude andwest longitude, which is appropriate for North America. It is possible, however,to enter southern latitudes and eastern longitudes, and therefore to find thedeclination for any point on the surface of the Earth. The website can also giveyou declination for any year from 1900 to 2015; this time span is increased astime progresses.Another useful website is the Canadian Geomagnetic Reference Field (CGRF),http://geomag.nrcan.gc.ca/calc/mdcal-eng.php[http://geomag.nrcan.gc.ca/calc/mdcal-eng.php]. This site gives you presentdeclination and its rate of change when you enter a set of latitude andlongitude coordinates. It also has drop-down menus for all major cities inCanada. The CGRF can also give you declination for any year from 1900 to 2015;this time span is increased as time progresses.TIP: The CGRF is specifically optimized for use in Canada, but it works just aswell for the United States and elsewhere. The CGRF data input assumes that alllatitudes are north and all longitudes are west. But it also allows southernlatitudes and eastern longitudes, so it can provide declination information forany place in the world.Both of the above-mentioned websites provide additional interesting and usefulinformation on declination and compass use.In most parts of the world, you can buy topographic maps with declinationinformation. If you go to a foreign country where you cannot find thedeclination, and if you do not have internet access, you can find a fairly closeestimate of the declination from the world declination map shown in figure 51[part0014.html#fig51] (source: NOAA magnetic declination website,http://maps.ngdc.noaa.gov/viewers/historical_declination/[http://maps.ngdc.noaa.gov/viewers/historical_declination/]).images [../images/00060.jpeg]Figure 51. World declination map for the year 2015: lines of constantdeclination are at 2-degree intervals. Positive numbers indicate eastdeclination; negative numbers indicate west declination.CHANGES IN DECLINATIONMagnetic declination is caused by the motion of magnetic material in Earth’score. The soil and rock upon which we live is only a relatively thin crust.Beneath this is a solid mantle of rock extending to a depth of about 1800 miles(2900 kilometers). Beneath this is a molten interior more than a thousand milesthick. In the center of our planet there is a solid inner core, rotating at aslightly different rate than the outer mantle. This rotational motion causes themolten material between the two solid portions to move. Since this material ismagnetic in nature (predominantly iron), its constant motion creates a slowlyvarying magnetic field.The motion of the molten magnetic material is mostly random and unpredictable,so we cannot predict with certainty what the declination will be at any givenplace far in the future. However, Earth is very large, and changes take placeslowly. Declination and its rate of change can therefore be studied and recordedover long periods of time to arrive at mathematical models that predictdeclination over a relatively short period of time, such as just a few years inthe future. This is the basis for the declination prediction models referred toabove.images [../images/00061.jpeg]Figure 52. Historical declination of SeattleOne example of how declination has changed over time is shown in figure 52[part0014.html#fig52], a graph showing the declination in Seattle, Washington,over the past two centuries, based on information from the NOAA website listedabove. You can obtain similar information for any other chosen location from theNOAA site. From the main web page, find and click on the “US HistoricDeclination” tab. Then enter the range of dates and the location, and you shouldget a tabular listing of magnetic declination for your location for as long atime period as declination has been measured in the past.It is very helpful for you to know how rapidly magnetic declination is changingfor your area of interest. This knowledge will enable you to evaluate theaccuracy of declination data printed on older maps, and to know how frequentlyyou need to make adjustments or modifications to your compass. You can obtainthis information from either of the above websites, since both provide thedeclination rate of change as well as the declination once you provide thecoordinates and desired date. If the rate of change is given in minutes peryear, and you want to get the rate of change in degrees per year, divide thenumber of minutes by 60. For example, a rate of change of 7.2 minutes per yearis 7.2 divided by 60, or 0.12 degree per year. The reciprocal of this value (1divided by 0.12) is the number of years for a 1° change; in this example, 8.3years. This means that in this example, the declination is forecast to change by1° in the next 8.3 years.If the rate of change is in the same direction as your declination (for example,if declination is east and rate of change is east), then the numerical value ofdeclination is increasing. If the rate of change and the declination are inopposite directions (for example, east declination and westerly rate of change),then the numerical value of declination will be decreasing.Table 7 [part0014.html#tab7] below is a listing of magnetic declination, itsrate of change, and the time period required for a 1° declination change, forone location in every state and province in the United States and Canada. Aglance at this table will give you at least a rough idea of how much thedeclination is changing in your area. You can see, for example, that declinationis barely changing at all in many of the mid-Atlantic states, Hawaii, andsouthern Ontario, whereas it is changing much more rapidly in Alaska, thenorthern states from Washington to North Dakota, and in the western provincesfrom British Columbia to Saskatchewan.Some wilderness travelers pencil in the current declination, along with its yearand month, on their paper topo maps for future reference.Table 7. Declination and Its Rate of Change, United States and Canada, 2015images [../images/00062.jpeg]images [../images/00063.jpeg]images [../images/00064.jpeg]Note: If declination and declination change are both in the same direction (asfor Alabama, where both are W), then the amount of declination is presentlyincreasing. Therefore, in nine years, the declination in Alabama is projected tobe about 4° W. If declination and declination change are in opposite directions(as for Wyoming, where declination is E but declination change is W), then theamount of declination is presently decreasing. So in seven years, thedeclination in Wyoming is projected to be about 9° E.DIPThe magnetic needle of the compass is not only affected by the horizontaldirection of Earth’s magnetic field but also by its vertical pull. The closeryou get to the magnetic north pole, the more the north-seeking end of the needletends to point downward. At the magnetic equator, the needle will be level,while at the south magnetic pole the north-seeking end of the needle tries topoint in an upward direction. This phenomenon is referred to as compass dip. Tocompensate for this effect, most compass manufacturers purposely introduce aslight imbalance to the magnetic needles of their compasses, so that their dipis negligible for the geographic area where they will be used. Earth is dividedinto several dip zones, and compasses sold in each zone may be compensated foruse in that zone.If you buy a compass in one dip zone and try to use it in another, the compassmay not work well because of the difference in dip. For example, if you buy acompass in North America or Europe and then try to use it in the southernhemisphere, the difference in dip may be enough to introduce errors in yourcompass readings or even make the compass impossible to use.TEST YOUR COMPASS FOR THE EFFECTS OF DIPIf you bring your compass to a faraway place, you should first try it out in anurban area as soon as you arrive there, to make sure it works properly beforeheading out into the wilderness. If it is adversely affected by dip, you mayhave to buy a new compass in the general area where you will be traveling beforeleaving town.To avoid problems with dip, you can buy a compass ahead of time that is properlycompensated for dip in the area you will be visiting. Some retail stores andmail-order companies have, or can order, compasses compensated for whatever zoneyou will be visiting.Some manufacturers produce compasses that are not affected by dip. Thesecompasses have the term “global” in their names, or a notation on the packagethat the compass is corrected for dip anywhere in the world. If you intend to goon worldwide adventures, you might consider purchasing such a compass. Tables 1[part0009.html#tab1] and 2 [part0009.html#tab2] in chapter 2[part0009.html#8IL20-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5] identify some suchcompasses.USING A CLINOMETERSome compasses are equipped with a clinometer, which measures angles of slope,or elevation angles, using a gravity-assisted needle. To use the clinometer onyour compass, follow these steps:images [../images/00065.jpeg]Figure 53. Clinometer bezel set for level conditions (reading 0°)1.First, hold the compass with its long edge horizontal, and turn the bezel sothat the numbered inside scale (usually the same scale used for declinationadjustment) is at the lower long edge of the compass (see figure 53[part0014.html#fig53]).2.Set either 90° or 270° at the index line, so that the needle points to zerowhen it is held level. (If the direction-of-travel arrow is pointing from rightto left, as in figure 53 [part0014.html#fig53], then you will set 270° at theindex line. If it is pointing from left to right, you will set 90° at the indexline.)3.Then, tilting the compass up or down will cause the clinometer needle to pointto the number of degrees upward or downward.There are two ways to use the clinometer. The first is to measure the elevationangle to a distant object. For example, suppose you are at the summit of a peak,and you see another peak of nearly the same elevation. You wonder if you are onthe higher of the two summits. Hold the compass with its long edge pointingtoward the other peak, as you sight along the long edge of the baseplate (seefigure 54 [part0014.html#fig54]). Steady the compass on a rock or other stableobject if possible. Tap the compass lightly to overcome any friction in themechanism, and ask a companion to look at the clinometer needle from the side tosee if it indicates an upward or a downward angle toward the other peak. In theclose-up of figure 55 [part0014.html#fig55], the angle is 34°.images [../images/00066.jpeg]Figure 54. Using a clinometer to find the angle of elevation of a distant objectimages [../images/00067.jpeg]Figure 55. Close-up of clinometer tilted upward; measured angle is 34°, asmeasured by the smallest arrow visible.TIP: With a mirrored compass, you can read the angle to the object yourself byfolding the mirror at a 45° angle, sighting along the edge of the baseplate atthe object, and reading the upward or downward angle in the mirror.If the clinometer indicates an upward angle, then the other peak is higher thanyou are. (Sorry. You will have to climb that one too.) If you know the elevationangle to any point, such as another peak, then if you read the distance to thatpoint off the map, you can use trigonometry to find the number of feet or metersthat the object is higher than you are (elevation above yours = distance xtangent of the elevation angle).The clinometer can also be used to find the angle of a slope. In chapter 6[part0013.html#CCNA0-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5], you learned how todetermine the angle of a slope from a map. The clinometer, however, can tell youthe actual angle of the slope on which you are standing. As above, set 90° or270° at the index line, so that it reads zero for the level condition. Then laythe long edge of the compass on the slope (figure 56 [part0014.html#fig56]).Read the angle of the slope on the clinometer scale. Due to variations in theslope over small distances, it is best to place an ice ax, a branch, a trekkingpole, or some other long object along the slope, and then place the long edge ofthe compass along this object to get a better idea of the average slope. Thepresence of metal, such as an ice ax or trekking pole shaft, will affect themagnetic needle but not the clinometer needle, which works with gravity (like aplumb bob).images [../images/00068.jpeg]Figure 56. Using a clinometer to measure the angle of a given slope at aparticular pointOTHER TYPES OF COMPASSESBaseplate compasses such as Silva, Suunto, and some others are similar to themodels shown in figure 8 [part0009.html#fig8], and the methods of using thesecompasses are as described in chapter 2[part0009.html#8IL20-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5]. Several Bruntonbaseplate compasses, which work differently from those mentioned above, are alsoavailable and can be used in wilderness navigation.Some Brunton compasses have adjustable declination arrows, but there is noscrewdriver adjustment as with other compasses. These are referred to as having“tool-free declination adjustment.” Instead, these have a round capsule withinthe rotating housing. To adjust for declination, you must squeeze this capsulebetween your thumb and forefinger while you grasp the rotating housing, orbezel, with your other hand. Then you turn the capsule to point the declinationarrow to the correct number of degrees, as shown in figure 57[part0014.html#fig57] (for example, 12° E in northwest Utah, or 345° in NewHampshire, for a declination of 15° W). The compass is then used to take andfollow bearings in the field in the same way as other compasses described inchapter 2 [part0009.html#8IL20-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5].Some Brunton compasses, such as the TruArc 3, have no meridian lines in thetransparent capsule, so the procedure for measuring and plotting bearings onmaps is also slightly different. These compasses have partial meridian lines,aligned with north and south on the dial, on the outer ring of the rotatinghousing. To measure or plot bearings on a map, follow the procedures describedearlier for other compasses, except align the partial meridian lines on theoutside ring with the north–south lines on the map. As with the other compasses,always make sure that the N on the rotating compass dial is aligned toward north(usually the top) of the map. In figure 58 [part0014.html#fig58], a BruntonTruArc 3 compass is being used to measure the bearing from point A to point B ona map. The partial meridian lines on the rotating housing are aligned with themeridian lines on the map, and you can see the result (320°) at the index line.images [../images/00069.jpeg]Figure 57. Adjusting a Brunton TruArc 3 compass for declination: A. for Utah,12° east and B. for New Hampshire, 15° westSome Brunton compasses in their newer TruArc series have “On the Map MeridianLines” like the other baseplate compasses described in chapter 2[part0009.html#8IL20-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5]. These are identified asTruArc models 5, 7, 10, 15, and 20, and they can be used in the same way as thecompasses described in chapter 2[part0009.html#8IL20-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5].Some baseplate compasses have rotating housings which are marked from 0° to 90°and back to 0°, and then to 90° and back to 0° again. These are called quadranttypes, and some people prefer them. Bearings taken with a quadrant compass areoften expressed as the number of degrees east or west of north or south. Forexample, S 20° E, which means 20° east of south, or 180° minus 20° equals 160°.We do not recommend these for wilderness navigation, since using them requiresthe use of mental arithmetic—and you know what we think of that.For wilderness travel we recommend baseplate compasses. All of the examples oftaking, following, measuring, and plotting bearings are based on the assumptionthat you are using such a compass. Most of the compasses listed in chapter 2[part0009.html#8IL20-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5] are marked to 2°divisions, and it is unlikely that you can achieve better accuracy than thatwith those compasses. Many people have difficulty obtaining better than 5°accuracy using compasses without a mirror. Even with a mirror, it is difficultto get accuracy consistently better than 2°. If you need better accuracy, thereare other, more precise compasses, most notably optical sighting compasses,which can provide better accuracy than baseplate compasses.There are also battery-operated digital compasses. Some of these are moreaccurate and more precise than most baseplate compasses and are useful if theaccuracy you need is not possible with a baseplate compass. Some wrist-wornaltimeter watches also contain compasses, such as the “ABC” watches (foraltimeter, barometer, and compass). They also tell the time. Some of these haveadjustable declination, while others do not, so with some of these you may needto add or subtract declination (as described in chapter 2[part0009.html#8IL20-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5]). Most of these are notbaseplate compasses, so in order to use any of these with a map you also need tohave a protractor or a baseplate compass to measure and plot bearings.images [../images/00070.jpeg]Figure 58. Using a Brunton TruArc 3 compass to measure a bearing on a mapAnother type of wrist-worn compass device combines a simple GPS receiver with an“ABC” watch. Some of these are the Garmin Fenix and Forerunner, and the SuuntoAmbit (see chapter 9 [part0016.html#F8900-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5]).These are quite expensive, but they allow the user to determine precise positioninformation (such as lat/long or UTM position coordinates) using the GPS featureand to measure and follow compass bearings using the digital compass, whilemonitoring altitude or barometric pressure with the altimeter/barometer sensor.Some of these have additional features such as heart rate monitors and theability to record training statistics.We recommend that if you purchase such a wrist-worn compass, you always bringalong a nonelectronic baseplate compass, as well as a paper map, on yourwilderness adventures, so that you can use it to measure and plot bearings on amap and to avoid completely depending on an electronic device with limitedbattery power.Baseplate compasses can be found at most outdoor recreation stores, whilenautical supply stores usually carry optical sighting compasses. In addition,several mail-order companies sell compasses, altimeters, GPS receivers, andother equipment of interest to the wilderness traveler. Two of these are the BenMeadows Company (1-800-241-6401; www.benmeadows.com [http://www.benmeadows.com])and Forestry Suppliers, Inc. (1-800-647-5368; www.forestry-suppliers.com[http://www.forestry-suppliers.com]).

We described what ismeant by compass dip, and how to deal with it, as well as the use of theclinometer feature of some compasses. Finally, we discussed some features anduses of compasses of types not covered in chapter 2[part0009.html#8IL20-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5].SKILLS CHECK•Where can you find current declination for your geographic area?•By how much is declination changing in your geographic area?•Why is compass dip important?

Bymonitoring the elevation and checking it against the topographic map, wildernesstravelers can keep track of their progress, pinpoint their location, and findtheir way to critical junctions on the route. In mountainous terrain, thealtimeter can be a great help in orientation, navigation, and routefinding.images [../images/00071.jpeg]Figure 59. Typical altimeters: A. digital wristwatch; B. digital pocket; C.analog pocketWHAT AN ALTIMETER IS AND HOW IT WORKSAn altimeter is basically a modified barometer. Both instruments measure airpressure (the weight of air). A barometer measures air pressure on a scalecalibrated in inches of mercury, millibars, kilopascals, or other units. Analtimeter also measures air pressure, but its scale is calibrated in feet ormeters above or below sea level. This is possible because air pressure changesat a known, predictable rate with changing altitude. The higher the altitude,the lower the air pressure.TYPES OF ALTIMETERSThe most popular type of wilderness altimeter is the digital wristwatchcombination (figure 59A [part0015.html#fig59]). Digital pocket altimeters(figure 59B [part0015.html#fig59]) are also available. A digital altimeter hasseveral advantages over the analog type (figure 59C [part0015.html#fig59]). Somedigital altimeters display additional information, such as the temperature andthe rate of altitude gain or loss. Since most people wear a watch anyway, thistype of altimeter is often preferred because it combines multiple functions intoone piece of equipment. The altimeter worn on the wrist is also more convenient,and therefore will be consulted more frequently than one kept in a pocket orpack.A disadvantage of a digital altimeter is that it requires a battery that canbecome discharged or can become temporarily disconnected due to mechanicalshock, or moisture, causing all of its data to be lost (as once happened to oneof the authors). The liquid crystal display (LCD) usually goes blank attemperatures near 0°F (–18°C), making it essential to keep the instrumentrelatively warm. (This is usually not a problem as long as you keep thealtimeter on your wrist. If it gets cold enough for the LCD to go blank, thealtimeter still retains all of its data and will display the data properly onceit warms up enough for the display to work.)TIP: When starting a technical rock-climbing pitch, it is a good idea to removeyour altimeter (or any other jewelry, including rings or bracelets, for thatmatter) and attach it to your shoulder strap or put it into your pack or pocketto keep it from getting damaged on the rock or stuck in a crack.There is a very wide range of altimeters available, from simple devices costingas little as $60 to units with a huge array of sophisticated features, andcosting up to $600. These generally fall into three categories:1.Basic, inexpensive altimeters ($60 to $200): These units, mostly digitalwristwatch type (though also some analog units), provide a readout of eitheraltitude or barometric pressure, some with a resolution of either 5 meters or 20feet, though some in this range have resolutions as little as 1 meter or 3 feet.Most units in this price range do not have additional functions such ascompasses. Such units are usually adequate for most casual hiking and climbing.2.Intermediate-range devices ($200 to approximately $400): These devices, almostentirely digital wristwatch styles, have all the features of the basic units,but have additional functions such as compasses, cumulative elevation gain andloss, tighter resolution (almost always down to 1 meter or 3 feet), ascent anddescent rates, stopwatch functions, countdown timers, and more. These includethe popular “ABC” (altimeter, barometer, compass) digital watches.3.Top-of-the-line units ($400 to $600): Some units in this price range, such asthe Suunto Ambit and the Garmin Fenix and Forerunner, add a GPS receiver andsometimes a heart-rate monitor to the other altimeter watch features. Theseunits allow their users to identify their point position in eitherlatitude/longitude or UTM coordinates, which can then enable them to find theirexact position on a paper map. Though the GPS receivers included in these unitsare not as complex and versatile as dedicated GPS receivers (see chapter 9[part0016.html#F8900-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5]), they nevertheless canprovide very important information to aid in orientation and navigation.Additional details of these and other such devices are available on themanufacturers’ websites such as www.suunto.com [http://www.suunto.com],www.silvausa.com [http://www.silvausa.com], www.casio.com[http://www.casio.com], www.higear.com [http://www.higear.com], www.garmin.com[http://www.garmin.com], and www.vestal.com [http://www.vestal.com], and on somestore websites such as www.rei.com [http://www.rei.com] andwww.thealtimeterstore.com [http://www.thealtimeterstore.com]. Be sure tocarefully read the characteristics of the altimeter you intend to buy beforedoing so. Pay particular attention to features such as precision or resolution(the smallest marked or displayed unit of elevation), user-replaceablebatteries, etc., as compared with your intended use of the device. For example,rates of ascent and descent may be more important to the hiker than the skier.If you intend to use the device in casual hiking, the most appropriate unitmight be a simple, inexpensive wristwatch altimeter that displays the time andthe altitude to the nearest five meters, and little else. Furthermore, you mightwant to consider the type of terrain in which you intend to travel. If youtravel in mountainous terrain, an altimeter is a nearly indispensable aid totravel. If you never intend to leave the flatlands, where there are noappreciable elevation changes, any altimeter at all might be a waste of moneyfor you.The analog altimeter has the advantage of being a simpler instrument. Itrequires no battery and continues to display the elevation even at temperatureswell below zero. To read an analog altimeter, hold it level in the palm of yourhand. Look directly down on the needle, your eyes at least a foot (30 cm) aboveit, to reduce errors due to viewing angle (parallax). Tap it lightly severaltimes to overcome any slight friction in the mechanism.PRECISION AND ACCURACYBecause even the most precise and costly altimeters are strongly influenced byatmospheric conditions, do not be misled into trusting them to a degree ofaccuracy that is greater than possible. A typical high-quality altimeter mayhave a resolution, or precision (smallest marked division of an analoginstrument, or smallest indicated change of a digital one) of 1 meter (3 feet).This does not mean the altimeter will always be that accurate (closeness to thetruth). Changes in weather could easily throw its reading off by hundreds offeet or meters, even if it is highly precise. This is an important fact to keepin mind when evaluating altimeters. Some of the least-expensive wristwatchaltimeters have a resolution of 5 meters (16 feet), which may seem like a lot,but is insignificant for most hiking and climbing situations. Such a unit may beperfectly acceptable for your activities, even though some of your companionsmay boast that their altimeters are much better than yours because they have a1-meter resolution. Both will be equally affected by weather-caused barometricpressure variations, which can introduce errors far exceeding the degree ofprecision.EFFECTS OF BAROMETRIC PRESSURE ON ALTIMETERSThe accuracy of an altimeter depends on the weather, because a change in theweather is usually accompanied by a change in barometric (air) pressure, whichcauses an error in the altimeter reading. A change in barometric pressure of 1inch of mercury corresponds to a change in altitude of roughly 1000 feet. (Apressure change of 10 millibars corresponds to about 100 meters of elevationchange.)Example: If you are in camp during a day in which the air pressure increases bytwo-tenths of an inch of mercury or 7 millibars (for example, from 30.00 to30.20 inches, or from 1016 to 1023 millibars), your altimeter will show areading about 200 feet (60 m) less than it was at the beginning of the day, eventhough you have remained in the same place. If you had gone out on a hike duringthat same day, your elevation readings by the end of the day would likewise havebeen about 200 feet (60 m) too low. During periods of unstable weather, theelevation indicated on your altimeter may change by as much as 500 feet (150 m)in one day even though your actual elevation has remained the same. Even duringapparently stable conditions, an erroneous indicated change in elevation of 100feet (30 m) per day is not uncommon. (Given these errors, what difference doesit make whether your altimeter has a resolution of 1 meter or 5 meters?)EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE ON ALTIMETERSThe altimeter sensor expands and contracts due to variations in temperature,causing changes in the indicated elevation. A bimetallic element intemperature-compensated altimeters adjusts for this effect when there is noactual change in elevation. When you are gaining or losing elevation, however,this compensation is often not enough, resulting in errors even intemperature-compensated altimeters.CAUTIONS WHEN USING AN ALTIMETERBecause of the strong influence of temperature and barometric pressure on analtimeter’s accuracy, you cannot trust the instrument until you first set it ata known elevation, such as a trailhead. Then it is important, when you aretraveling, to check the reading whenever you reach other points of knownelevation, so you can reset it if necessary, or at least be aware of the error.Get to know your altimeter, use it often, check it at every opportunity, andnote differences of opinion between it and the map. You will soon learn justwhat level of accuracy to expect, and your altimeter will become a dependableaid to roving the wilds.COPING WITH TEMPERATURE CHANGESTo minimize the effects of temperature changes, try to keep the altimeter’stemperature as constant as possible. Body heat will help to accomplish this witha wristwatch altimeter, particularly if it is worn under a parka when theoutside temperature is low. With an analog altimeter, you can keep itstemperature relatively constant by carrying it in your pocket rather than inyour pack.USING AN ALTIMETER IN WILDERNESS TRAVELKnowing your elevation at any time might seem interesting, but you may wonderhow you can actually use this information when navigating in the wilderness. Theanswer is that using an altimeter can be a big help to you in the followingways:•Orientation (finding your point position)•Navigation (getting to where you want to go)•Wise decision-making (e.g., whether to proceed or turn back)•Predicting the weather•Enhancing the usefulness of using the bearing of the slopeOrientationAn altimeter can be a big help in determining exactly where you are. If you areclimbing a ridge, following a stream uphill, or hiking up a trail shown on themap, but you do not know exactly where you are along the ridge, stream, ortrail, check the altimeter for the elevation. Where the ridge, stream, or trailreaches that contour line on the map is your likely location.NavigationNavigation becomes easier with an altimeter. For example, if you top aconvenient couloir at 9400 feet (2870 meters) and gain the ridge you want toascend, make a note of that elevation in a notebook or on the map. On yourreturn, descend the ridge to that same elevation and you should easily find thecouloir again, even if clouds have come in and obscured all visibility. (Thishappened to one of the authors on a climb of Mount Shasta.)Guidebook descriptions sometimes specify a change of direction at a particularelevation. If you are on an open snowfield or a forested hillside, good luck inmaking the turn at the right place without an altimeter. The route you haveworked out on a topographic map also may depend on course changes at certainelevations, and again the altimeter will keep your party on target.Wise Decision-MakingThe altimeter can help you to decide whether to continue a trip or to turn backby letting you calculate your rate of ascent. Suppose you have been keeping anhourly check on time and elevation during a climb. It has taken the party fourhours to ascend 3000 feet (910 m), an average of 750 feet (230 m) per hour. Butyou know that the actual rate of ascent has been declining with each hour. Infact, the party gained only 500 feet (150 m) in the past hour, compared with1000 feet (300 m) in the first hour. You know that the destination is at anelevation of 8400 feet (2560 m), and an altimeter reading shows you are now at6400 feet (1950 m).You can therefore predict that it will take roughly four more hours to reachyour destination. Take that information, courtesy of the altimeter, combine itwith a look at the weather, the time of the day, and the condition of teammembers, and you have the data on which to base a sound decision as to whetherto proceed with the trip or turn back.Predicting the WeatherThe altimeter can help in predicting the weather. The readings on an altimeterand a barometer operate in opposition to one another. When one goes up, theother goes down. An altimeter reading that shows an increase in elevation whenno actual elevation change has taken place (such as at camp overnight) means afalling barometer, which often predicts deteriorating weather. An altimeterreading that shows a decrease in elevation, on the other hand, means increasingbarometric pressure and possibly improving weather. This is anoversimplification, of course; weather forecasting is complicated by the wind,local weather peculiarities, and the rate of barometric pressure change.CAUTION IN WEATHER FORECASTINGProfessional weather forecasters have far more sophisticated weather instrumentsthan a simple barometer, yet they are frequently very wrong. So don’t get overlyconfident in predicting weather just from altimeter/barometer readings. Makefrequent observations of altimeter readings and weather patterns on yourtrips—and even while at home—if you want to figure out the relationship betweenweather and altimeter readings in your particular geographic area.Some digital wristwatch altimeters can be set to read barometric pressureinstead of altitude. But keep in mind that changes in barometric pressure areuseful in assessing the weather only when the readings are taken at a constantelevation (such as in camp). Using the altimeter as a barometer while you areascending or descending will give readings that are influenced not only bychanges in barometric pressure but also by changes in your elevation as youtravel. Your conclusions about barometric pressure trends may be erroneous undersuch circumstances.Use of Bearing of the Slope with an AltimeterThe bearing of the slope (described in chapter 3[part0010.html#9H5K0-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5]) becomes a very powerfultool when combined with altimeter use. Sometimes, when on a featureless snowslope, in a dense forest, or in foggy conditions, it is impossible to takebearings on visible landmarks, and there are no identifiable topographicfeatures for you to compare to the map. Under these and similar conditions,knowing your altitude plus the bearing of the slope can often provide enoughinformation to enable you to determine your position with a high degree ofcertainty. In fact, in the absence of definite topographic features or visiblelandmarks, the use of the altimeter plus the bearing of the slope might well bethe only way to determine your position, unless you have a GPS receiver.CHAPTER SUMMARYThis chapter has covered different types and characteristics of altimeters, whatthey do and how they work, and the important distinction between resolution(precision) and accuracy.

Typical GPS satellite (Courtesy of www.gps.gov [http://www.gps.gov])images [../images/00073.jpeg]Figure 61. GPS satellites in orbit around Earth (Courtesy of www.gps.gov[http://www.gps.gov])Note that what follows is only a brief overview of GPS essentials. Refer to ourother book, Wilderness GPS: A Step-by-Step Guide (Mountaineers Books, 2013), forcomplete information on using GPS devices for wilderness navigation.The US Department of Defense has placed a system of twenty-eight satellites(plus a few spares; see figure 60 [part0016.html#fig60]) in orbit around Earth(see figure 61 [part0016.html#fig61]). Some other countries have also createdsimilar systems, such as Russia’s GLONASS, or have plans to do so in the future.GPS receivers pick up signals from some of these satellites and can give theuser’s geographic position and altitude to within about 50 feet (15 meters)under ideal conditions.The unique utility of a GPS receiver is that it can give you your position onEarth’s surface (to within a sphere with a radius about the size of aracquetball court) and, in addition, can tell you the distance and direction toany other known position. In other words, it can provide you precise orientationand navigation, in the absence of any visible landmarks.SELECTING A GPS RECEIVERMost GPS receivers cost from $100 to $600 and have a variety of features thatallow them to store and later recall specific positions (called waypoints) andplot out routes comprising a series of waypoints from one position to another.The difference between the inexpensive units and the expensive ones is generallyin the number of additional features that they have.There are some very inexpensive units (under $100) that only tell you how to getback to a previously saved waypoint. Examples are the Bushnell BackTrack (seefigure 62 [part0016.html#fig62]) and the Brunton GET-BACK. Though they do notdisplay your actual position coordinates and cannot guide you to a waypoint youhave not previously visited, they can nevertheless be used in an emergency toavoid getting totally lost, by pointing out the distance and direction to one ofthree previously visited and saved waypoints (such as car, camp, and home). Theyare the simplest of all GPS units to learn how to use. You might consider such aunit if you intend to use it only for emergency backup.images [../images/00074.jpeg]Figure 62. Bushnell BackTrack GPS deviceA big step up from these are the slightly more expensive ($100 to $150) unitsthat display the lat/long or UTM coordinates (explained in chapter 6[part0013.html#CCNA0-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5]) of hundreds or eventhousands of waypoints. Examples are the Garmin eTrex 10 and Foretrex 301 andthe Magellan eXplorist 110. They do not display your position on a map, but byreading your UTM or lat/long coordinates on the unit’s screen, you can find yourposition on the paper topo map or chart that you still must carry. These unitsalso allow you to enter the UTM or lat/long coordinates of places where you havenever visited, by finding these coordinates from your paper map and enteringthese into the GPS unit. Most of these units do not include compasses, so youstill need to use your baseplate compass to point you in the right direction toyour destination.images [../images/00075.jpeg]Figure 63. Garmin eTrex 20 GPS deviceMore expensive models ($150 to $300) also display their locations on detaileddigital topographical maps or charts. Examples are the Magellan eXplorist 310and 510 and the Garmin eTrex 20 (figure 63 [part0016.html#fig63]) and eTrex 30.These come with a preloaded “base map” that contains major roads and highways,but no detailed maps with topographic features. The latter can be added bypurchasing separate digital maps on cards that usually cost $80 to $100 for astate or region.images [../images/00076.jpeg]Figure 64. Magellan eXplorist 610 GPS deviceThe most expensive receivers ($300 to $600) add preloaded topographic maps,compasses, cameras, touch screens, and/or wireless communication. Examplesinclude the Magellan eXplorist 610 (figure 64 [part0016.html#fig64]) and 710,Garmin Oregon 550t, Montana 600, and DeLorme Earthmate PN-60 and PN-60W (figure65 [part0016.html#fig65]). Also in this group are GPS-enabled “ABC” (altimeter,barometer, compass) sport wristwatches such as the Suunto Ambit (figure 66[part0016.html#fig66]) and Garmin Fenix and Forerunner.images [../images/00077.jpeg]Figure 65. DeLorme Earthmate PN-60W GPS deviceThere is no need to spend a lot of money for a GPS device with preloaded topomaps, a touch screen, a built-in compass, a camera, and other refinements. Abasic device costing less than $150 will perform all the essential GPS functionsyou need for orientation and navigation, though you must use it together withyour paper map and baseplate compass, which you must still carry with youanyway.Some receivers are designed to make use of additional satellites that comprisethe Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) in the United States, resulting in evengreater accuracy—as close as 3 meters (10 feet) under ideal conditions, if youhave an adequate view of the southern sky. Such receivers are said to be “WAASenabled.” Similar systems, such as the European Geostationary Navigation OverlayService (EGNOS) and Japan’s Multi-functional Satellite Augmentation System(MSAS) also exist, and more are planned for other areas. Some devicemanufacturers refer to such systems as Space-Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS).These systems were designed primarily for aviation purposes, to aid in flightcontrol and aircraft landing. Their usefulness in ground applications such aswilderness navigation is limited by the fact that such satellites appear veryclose to the horizon from northern areas, since the satellites are in orbit overthe earth’s equator. This limits their effectiveness in the northern UnitedStates, Canada, and northern Europe and Asia.images [../images/00078.jpeg]Figure 66. Suunto Ambit GPS watchMuch useful information on GPS receivers is available on manufacturers’ websitessuch as www.magellangps.com [http://www.magellangps.com], www.garmin.com[http://www.garmin.com], www.delorme.com [http://www.delorme.com], andwww.brunton.com [http://www.brunton.com], as well as the US government GPSwebsite, www.gps.gov [http://www.gps.gov].GETTING STARTED WITH GPSAvoid the temptation to rush out into the wilderness, get lost, and trust thatthis marvelous electronic gadget will magically get you home again. Instead, atleast read its Quick Start Guide, a shorter and abbreviated version of theinstruction manual. (This chapter is intended only as a supplement to theinstruction manual that comes with your GPS receiver.) Select which units to use(miles or kilometers, feet or meters, magnetic or true bearings, etc.) and—veryimportant—select the datum to agree with the topographic map of the area (thedatum was explained in chapter 6[part0013.html#CCNA0-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5]). These options aregenerally accessible using the device’s “Settings” or “Set Up” function. If youare using the compass methods described in chapter 2[part0009.html#8IL20-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5] of this book, be sure touse true bearings (usually the default north reference setting) rather thanmagnetic bearings. Try out the receiver around your home, in city parks, and oneasy trail hikes before taking it into the wilderness. Eventually, read theentire instruction manual to learn of all its features.The most important rule of using a GPS receiver is to avoid becoming dependenton it. It is best to consider the GPS receiver as an extra navigational tool, asa useful addition to a paper map and a magnetic compass, rather than as areplacement for them. If conditions warrant, carry route-marking materials suchas flagging and wands, regardless of whether or not you have a GPS receiver.Never rely solely on a GPS receiver for navigation.USING A GPS RECEIVER IN WILDERNESS NAVIGATIONTo minimize battery usage, you can use your GPS receiver along with a map andcompass in order to ensure that you can get back to your starting point. Forexample, at the trailhead or campsite, or wherever you start your trip, turn thereceiver on to establish your GPS position. Compare the displayed coordinates tothe map to ensure that it makes sense. (Under rare but nevertheless occasionalconditions, erroneous positions are sometimes displayed.) If the position looksvalid, save this position as a waypoint, even giving it a unique name (such asCAR or CAMP) if desired. Then turn off the receiver to save battery power, andpack it away carefully to protect it from harm while you are traveling. Alongthe route, you may encounter crucial locations, such as important trailjunctions, the point where you reach a trail or a ridge crest, etc. At suchpoints, turn on the receiver to establish additional waypoints. Again, make suretheir coordinates match those on the map. Once you are at your destination orturnaround point, use the receiver to find the distance and compass bearing fromone waypoint to another to return to the starting point. Then turn off thereceiver and use your compass to travel to the next waypoint. At any point atwhich you turn on the receiver and get a position, you can ask the receiver toGO to any previously stored waypoint. The receiver will then provide thedistance and compass bearing to that waypoint.Many GPS instruction manuals seem to assume that you are always traveling withthe receiver turned on and in your hand, constantly observing its display. Doingthis wastes battery power and occupies a hand that might be better used forclimbing, scrambling, or holding an ice ax or a trekking pole. In addition, itdistracts you from observing the route, its hazards, and the scenery, and itlooks really nerdy. The most efficient way to use a GPS receiver is to use itonly occasionally and to travel by map and compass the rest of the time.Under some conditions it might be advantageous to leave a GPS receiver turned oncontinuously while you travel—such as when you are descending through theforest, down a snow slope in a whiteout, or when it is late and darkness isapproaching. Under such conditions, every minute might count, making itinconvenient to stop for a few minutes every now and then to turn the receiveron and then allow it to reacquire the position.If you decide to leave your receiver on as you travel toward your destination,it will record your route. Then on your return trip you can use the receiver’sbacktrack mode to retrace your steps very closely. This feature can only be usedif you leave the receiver on the entire time en route to your destination, aswell as on the return trip. Obviously, this method will exhaust batteries muchmore quickly than occasional use, so carrying spare batteries is essential.TIP: If you want to leave the receiver turned on so that you can refer to itcontinuously, we suggest that you find a way to securely attach it to a packstrap or some other easily accessible place so your hands are free while youtravel. Then you can look at the receiver any time you want while using yourhands for other purposes.Be sure to start each wilderness adventure with a fresh set of batteries, andconsider carrying spares, depending on the length of your projected trip andyour estimated usage of the device.GPS receivers have some obvious advantages over magnetic compasses. A compasscan tell you your position only if you can see landmarks and can take bearingson them. The GPS receiver, on the other hand, can provide your position withoutany visible landmarks (under ideal conditions). This can be particularly helpfulin fog or a whiteout or in featureless terrain.In chapter 4 [part0011.html#AFM60-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5] we describedvarious strategies to use to follow a compass bearing toward your objective,such as the use of intermediate objectives and detouring around an obstruction.When using a compass, such techniques are essential in order to stay on yourcorrect course. With a GPS receiver, however, navigation becomes easier. If youare trying to follow a given bearing to your destination and the route isblocked, you can simply travel around the blockage by the easiest route withoutworrying about how far off route you get or in what direction. Once past theobstruction, you can again turn on your GPS receiver, obtain a new position, andthe receiver will provide the new bearing to your objective. Then you can setthat new bearing on your compass and follow it.TIP: When planning a wilderness trip, we suggest that you find the coordinatesof critical sites (e.g., the starting point, critical junctions, thedestination, and other crucial points) on the map and enter them into the GPSreceiver as waypoints. This is easiest to do at home before your trip.INTERFACING A GPS RECEIVER WITH A HOME COMPUTERThe GPS device on its own is a great tool, but when you connect it to your homecomputer a whole new world of functionality emerges. If you are a Mac user, besure that the GPS device you buy is compatible with the Mac OS operating system.(Almost all GPS devices by default work with the PC Windows operating system ifthey have computer connectivity at all. Some work only with the Windowsoperating system.)TIP: The GPS receiver itself is a valuable navigational tool. It is notabsolutely necessary to interface your GPS device with a computer to use iteffectively, so you should not feel intimidated by PC interfacing if you are notproficient with computer usage.Internet and Physical ConnectionsIf you seek PC compatibility, internet access is a must, especially if you wishto download plug-ins, additional software, and updates. A physical connectionbetween your GPS receiver and computer (PC) is necessary for the two tocommunicate, usually through a USB cable, though sometimes via wirelessconnectivity. Follow the receiver’s instructions on how to make such aconnection.Software UpgradeOnce the GPS device is recognized by your home computer, it is possible that thedevice will need a software upgrade. If so, follow the onscreen directions to doso. If there is no paper user’s manual, then you may have to download it fromthe internet.Removable MemoryMany GPS receivers have a slot (sometimes hidden behind the batteries) to acceptportable memory on an SD or micro-SD card (see figure 67 [part0016.html#fig67]).This is used to transfer maps and to use as expandable memory for screenshotsand photographs (if so equipped). This enables you to map out an entire trip onthe large-screen monitor of your home computer and save that trip and all itswaypoints to the memory card.images [../images/00079.jpeg]Figure 67. Micro-SD card compared to a dimeTrip Planning and AnalysisOnce you have established communication between your GPS device and your homecomputer, you have the ability to define waypoints and routes on your PC, andthen to transfer them to the GPS receiver, either directly though the cable, orby entering the lat/long or UTM coordinates directly into the receiver manually.Using the GPS unit and home computer interface also allows you to analyze a triponce completed. On your trip you may have collected data via your GPS device,such as your starting point, waypoints, tracks, and other GPS data. Once youreturn home, your device (or SD card) can be connected to your home computer toanalyze the data, or to share it with friends. You can often display your rateof elevation gain, speed of travel, distance traveled, and other information.Brand-Specific SoftwareThe websites for the receivers (e.g., www.garmin.com [http://www.garmin.com],www.magellangps.com [http://www.magellangps.com], www.delorme.com[http://www.delorme.com], etc.) usually have instructions for loading thebrand-specific software onto your computer. DeLorme units use Topo North Americasoftware. Garmin uses Garmin Connect Base Camp, and Magellan uses Vantage Point.All of these are included with the purchase of these three brands, though forGarmin units, the actual 1:24,000-scale topo maps for each geographic area areavailable on SD cards at added cost. Some GPS device instruction manuals haveonly limited information on how to use these software packages. In these cases,finding and reading on-screen “help” instructions will enable you to find how toperform these functions.LIMITATIONS AND PITFALLS OF GPS RECEIVERSThe GPS receiver is not a substitute for a map and compass or the ability to usethem. Many GPS receivers cannot determine direction, so you still need a compassto use GPS in the wilderness. Most GPS receivers can tell you the straight-lineroute from one point to another, but they have no way of knowing if there is ariver, a lake, or a cliff along this route. For this reason, you still must havea topographic map with you, even if you also have a GPS receiver.The more expensive GPS receivers contain built-in maps and can accepttopographic maps downloaded from your computer. These receivers can show yourposition directly on the screen of your receiver. While this is a very usefulfeature, it does not replace the need for conventional paper maps, because youstill need to be able to view the big picture of the route as well as to avoidtotal dependence on the GPS receiver. Furthermore, using the electronic mapsrequires a great deal of panning and zooming in and out, which can be tediousand time- and power-consuming. It is easier and quicker to simply glance at apaper topo map.Some GPS receivers also contain built-in electronic compasses. Using such aninstrument eliminates the need to set the correct course bearing on yourmagnetic compass. You could then conceivably do all your navigating using onlyyour GPS receiver. Even with such a receiver, however, you still need to carry amagnetic compass, in case the GPS receiver’s compass loses its calibration(which can happen when the batteries are replaced, or if the device is droppedor bumped, or sometimes for no apparent reason), exhausts its batteries, orotherwise fails to work properly.Most GPS receivers will not work at temperatures much below freezing, andbattery life is limited to fifteen to thirty hours, depending on the model andthe type of batteries used.GPS receivers must track signals from at least four satellites in order toprovide trustworthy position information, but if the satellite signals areblocked by heavy forest cover, cliffs, or canyons, this is often not possible.When a GPS receiver is not able to pick up signals from the four satellites itneeds in order to provide a three-dimensional position, it sacrifices altitudeinformation in favor of horizontal position. Some receivers indicate that thisis happening by displaying a “2D” message or icon to tell you that it isoperating in a two-dimensional mode. Some receivers merely display a “frozen”altitude display if this occurs. In either case, always note whether you aregetting a two-dimensional position. If so, then be aware of the fact that theGPS receiver’s horizontal position may be significantly in error as well,particularly if you are thousands of feet or meters above sea level. Under suchless-than-ideal conditions, horizontal position errors of 1000 feet (hundreds ofmeters) or more are possible.Because of the slight possibility that a GPS receiver might have a positionerror, it is wise to exercise some caution before using or saving a waypoint.For example, suppose you are in a parking lot at a trailhead and you acquire aGPS position. This will be an important waypoint, since you will certainly wantto get back to your vehicle at the end of your trek. Instead of just mindlesslysaving this position, you should first observe the coordinates indicated on thescreen of the receiver and compare them to the map. These coordinates shouldindicate a position very close to your known location. Also, observe theelevation indicated on the GPS receiver screen, and compare it with that shownon your map or altimeter. Again, they should agree closely. Any significantdifference between either your known position or altitude and that shown on theGPS receiver should alert you to the possibility that you might have anerroneous GPS position, perhaps due to signal reflections off cliffs, cars, orother structures (see figure 68 [part0016.html#fig68]), or perhaps due to someatmospheric disturbance. In this case, wait a few minutes or walk a shortdistance and try again. Do not save any important waypoint until you haveverified that it is in reasonable agreement with your position as shown on themap.images [../images/00080.jpeg]Figure 68. Multipath signal reflectionCOPING WITH THE LIMITATIONS OF GPS RECEIVERSA variety of conditions and situations can occur that might prevent the GPS fromgiving you the information you need for navigation in the wilderness. We havepreviously mentioned some of these: deep canyons or heavy forest cover thatprevent acquisition of enough satellite signals to obtain a position; outsidetemperatures below the minimum required for the receiver’s LCD display; largeinaccuracies caused by multipath signals due to reflections of satellitesignals; exceeding battery life; losing or damaging your receiver; andelectronic failure. These conditions are generally rare, and in many casespreventable. Still, such conditions can and do occur. Although it is impossibleto counteract all possible failures and inaccuracies, with a little forethoughtand planning it should be possible to get to your objective and back home safelyeven without a functioning GPS receiver.One obvious preventive measure, particularly when traveling in a group, is tocarry two or more GPS receivers. These devices are becoming more and morepopular and affordable, and when planning a wilderness trip it is often easy tofind at least one other person in the party who also has a GPS receiver. Therandom failure of one receiver could therefore be overcome, but it might nothelp if the loss of usage is due to a problem affecting both receivers, such asextreme cold, deep canyons, or excessive forest cover. If your navigation planinvolves using GPS as your primary navigational tool, you should seriouslyconsider carrying a second receiver on your trip.Cold-Temperature OperationEvery GPS receiver has a lower-temperature operating limit, below which it willnot display any data, due to inherent characteristics of its display. Variousreceivers have different temperature requirements, but generally this lowerlimit is somewhere between -5°F and +14°F (-20°C and -10°C), depending on theparticular unit. You can usually find this information in the Specificationssection of the user manual. If you contemplate using the receiver in suchconditions, you should test the receiver’s cold-temperature operation at or nearyour home in cold conditions (such as in your freezer) before you trust it tooperate in a cold climate. If you need it to operate at a temperature lower thanits lower limit, you might resort to carrying it close to your body, in a pocketor other location under several layers of clothing. Most receivers are notpermanently damaged due to exposure to cold temperatures, and many still operateand can track your position under cold conditions but simply cannot display yourposition. They usually return to normal operation after they warm up.Maximizing Battery LifeMany GPS users complain that their receivers use batteries at a faster rate thanadvertised. There are a few things that you can do in order to increase batterylife. In many cases you can use longer-lasting lithium batteries rather thanstandard alkaline batteries. Lithium cells cost more but may save you money inthe long run since they last longer. Furthermore, they work more reliably atcold temperatures and weigh less.If you operate your GPS receiver at a moderate temperature, its batteries willlast longer. You should keep the receiver and any spare batteries out of directsunlight, and inside your jacket on cold days.Turn off your receiver when navigation is easy or straightforward, such as whilewalking along a good, well-maintained trail, as well as when in heavy forestcover or in a canyon where the unit will waste power trying to search forsignals that it cannot receive. Disable the WAAS, EGNOS, or SBAS function if youdo not have a clear view of the horizon, since it takes extra battery power forthe receiver to keep searching for a satellite that it cannot find. Somereceivers have WAAS permanently enabled, so this may not be an option. Seefigure 69 [part0016.html#fig69] for an example of DeLorme’s Earthmate: Go toSettings, then System, press ENTER, and choose WAAS on or off. Garmin’s eTrex(figure 70 [part0016.html#fig70]) is similar: from the Main Menu, go to Setup,then System, and observe the Satellite System screen. You can then turnWAAS/EGNOS on or off. For the Magellan eXplorist, from the main menu go toTools, then Satellite, then Options. You should see a screen similar to that infigure 71 [part0016.html#fig71], allowing you to enable or disable SBAS(Space-Based Augmentation System: the combination of WAAS and EGNOS). Otherunits made by the same manufacturers have similar ways to turn WAAS off.images [../images/00081.jpeg]Figure 69. WAAS off on the DeLorme Earthmate PN-60W receiver.images [../images/00082.jpeg]Figure 70. Disable WAAS and EGNOS on the Garmin eTrex 20 receiver.images [../images/00083.jpeg]Figure 71. Disable SBAS on the Magellan eXplorist 610 device.Additional battery-saving techniques include reducing backlight brightness andthe “timer off” period for the display screen’s light dimmer. Most receiversallow you to set the brightness and timer-off time to lesser values than thedefault conditions. Also, disable power drainers such as the compass, barometer,and altimeter if they are not being used.Conventional Map-and-Compass NavigationOf course, the most important method of coping with any GPS problem is yourability to fall back on conventional map and compass navigational techniques. Wehave warned you against becoming totally dependent on your GPS receiver. Alwayscarry a compass and a paper topographic map of the area in which you aretraveling, even if the receiver has an electronic compass and a digital map ofthe area. You should never allow yourself to get into a situation where thefailure of an electronic device will jeopardize your safety or your ability toget back home. (Don’t ever have to say, “It’s not my fault that we got lost—thebatteries in my GPS died.”)USING THE GPS FUNCTION IN SMART DEVICESFor many of us, smart phones have become an integral part of our modern world.This section explains how to best use such devices for navigation in thewilderness environment. (In this section we will refer to smart phones and smartdevices interchangeably.)images [../images/00084.jpeg]Figure 72. Comparative signal ranges of smart devicesSmart phones receive signals from three sources: a Wi-Fi network, the cellularnetwork, and GPS satellites. The ranges of these signals are several hundredfeet for Wi-Fi signals and a few miles (up to 50) for cellular phone signals.GPS signals, on the other hand, can travel thousands of miles and are availableanywhere on Earth. Figure 72 [part0016.html#fig72] shows the relative ranges ofthe three types of signals. In wilderness travel you are often traveling outsideof Wi-Fi and cell phone range and are using GPS signals alone.The GPS Signal, Wi-Fi, and the Cellular NetworkMost smart phones have GPS capability. They can display your position on adigital map (see figure 73 [part0016.html#fig73]). However, topographic maps arenot transmitted to your device through the GPS satellite signal. The maps arebest downloaded through the Wi-Fi connection, if one is available; if not, thenthrough the much slower cellular network, neither of which is always availablein the wilderness. If you have not downloaded the maps for the area in which youwill be traveling, and you are out of Wi-Fi and cell tower range, your smartphone/mobile device may be able to display your position from the GPS signals,but only as a dot on a grid or a blank screen (see figure 74[part0016.html#fig74]). One way around this is to “cache” a map of the area bypanning and zooming into an area that you will be traveling to beforehand, whilestill in range of Wi-Fi or cell phone towers. We encourage you to test thisaction before you ever depend on it.images [../images/00085.jpeg]Figure 73. Topo map displayed on an iPhone screen with latitude and longitudecoordinates shown at the top of the screenimages [../images/00086.jpeg]Figure 74. Position from a GPS signal when out of cell network rangeIf you have not previously downloaded or cached a map of the area and just get adot on a grid, you should still be able to find your location by getting thedevice to display the latitude/longitude (at the top of figure 74[part0016.html#fig74]) or UTM coordinates even if the map is not displayed. Thenyou can find your position on the paper map that you will be carrying anyway.But you must always examine these coordinates carefully and make sure that theymake sense to you, and that they are not merely the last known coordinates (acommon default condition of smart phones as well as dedicated GPS receivers whenthe device cannot obtain a current satellite position fix).Alternatively, your smart device may simply tell you that you are “outside ofthe cellular network” or “Search Results Not Available” (figure 75[part0016.html#fig75]), politely telling you that it is only receiving half ofthe data: position only, without map data. Without a paper map, the coordinatesare usually useless for navigation.images [../images/00087.jpeg]Figure 75. Out-of-cellular-range message displayed on iPhone screenimages [../images/00088.jpeg]Figure 76. The Settings screen enables you to turn Wi-Fi, cellular access, andother functions on or off.There’s an App for That!To test your smart phone’s GPS function, install one of the many GPS apps, suchas Where Am I At?, Green Trails Maps, SkiTracks, AllTrails, Google Maps, Gaia,Backcountry Navigator Pro, or others. Then go into your smart device’s settings(see figure 76 [part0016.html#fig76]), with GPS (sometimes described as LocationServices) enabled, and simulate the wilderness environment signal reception byturning off your Wi-Fi and cellular network access. This leaves only the GPSradio waves receivable. Start your GPS app and see what happens. Does itindicate a strong GPS signal? Does it give a location that makes sense to you?Does it give a location at all? If so, make note of it or take a screenshot. Toensure a good position, be sure to observe the displayed position for a fewminutes.Now it’s time for a short walk, drive, or bike ride to a familiar location.Leave the Wi-Fi and cellular network off while doing so.Once you are some distance from where you first obtained a GPS signal, fire upthe GPS app and observe the GPS coordinates once again. Compare the newcoordinates to the saved screenshot. Are they different? Do the new coordinatesmatch your known position? Oftentimes a GPS device, even a smart device, willdisplay the last known position if a current position cannot be calculated. Thisis why it is so important to compare the position that the device indicates withyour known position. Bad information is worse than no information at all. If thenew position agrees with your current position, then you have data that you canwork with. Experiment with free apps and read reviews of paid apps to see if aparticular app is worth the money for your particular needs.On any wilderness excursion, it is imperative to leave your trip itinerary witha responsible person, as noted in chapter 5[part0012.html#BE6O0-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5]. There are apps for thattoo! One in particular is Bugle (see figure 77 [part0016.html#fig77]). Onceactivated, if the user does not inactivate the fail-safe messaging system uponreturning from the wilderness adventure (or blind date, Craigslist meeting, orother potentially risky endeavor), Bugle automatically transmits a message toselected contacts with instructions as to your trip details, route, and where tosearch for you if you do not report in as planned.images [../images/00089.jpeg]Figure 77. Let friends know your itinerary with an app such as Bugle.Digital MapsThe key to successful navigation with a smart device is downloading the mostdetailed maps of the area in which you will be traveling well before yourjourney begins. There are several free and paid apps that allow you to downloaddetailed topo maps. Be sure to do this in a civilized area with a strong Wi-Fisignal, since attempting to download detailed maps while driving to remotetrailheads can be slow and frustrating, if possible at all. Downloading the mapmay be as simple as zooming in as close as possible to your entire wildernessroute. Your smart device may be capable enough to cache the map data and displayit later once it is outside of the cellular network.PRECAUTIONS WHEN USING SMART MOBILE DEVICES FOR WILDERNESS NAVIGATIONA smart device is an excellent SMS (text messaging) device, a quality phone, anokay camera, a fairly good web surfer, a good portable media player, a goodemail device, flashlight, MP3 player, and, under perfect conditions, a reliableGPS device. But there is one major deal-breaker of a drawback: battery life.Battery LifeSmart device users often complain about the limited battery life of theirdevices in urban areas, where there is easy access to wall or car chargers. Butjust wait until you enable its location services and/or GPS applications on yourwilderness adventure! Powering up your GPS receiver on your mobile device cansuck your battery dry within only a few hours. This all-in-one device, withlimited battery power remaining, will give you only fleeting access to GPS,Wi-Fi, cell phone, photography, and SMS.There are, however, a few tips for extending your smart phone’s battery lifewhile the GPS function is powered up. The first is to turn off power-hungryapps. (Ironically, powering up the GPS circuitry for use with GPS apps is ahighly battery-draining action.) With an iPhone, double-click the home buttonand swipe upward all of the large icons on the screen to close them. This willgreatly help to conserve battery life.To further save battery power on the iPhone, tap Settings, then Notifications,and turn off all apps that are in your notification center. This will preventthe device from waking up when that particular app is activated by an incomingmessage, a social media update, stock report, or traffic or news update.Another useful trick is to turn down the brightness of the display, and todecrease the amount of time that the auto-lock feature allows beforeautomatically putting the device into sleep mode. The display consumes muchenergy, and even a slight dimming will correlate to increased battery life.(That said, on a bright day above tree line, the dimmed display is harder toread.) Experiment with different settings for screen brightness to see just howbright the screen really needs to be in order to be usefully visible outdoors.Among the plethora of other ways to conserve power for your smart phone (searchthe internet for your particular device), the best way, of course, is to turnoff your device completely when you don’t need it. To turn an iPhone off, pressand hold the SLEEP button for about three seconds until the “slide to power off”appears and slide to “off.” (To wake the iPhone, press and hold the SLEEP buttonuntil the Apple logo appears.) Then turn it on only at key locations, obtain agood 3-D position that agrees with your known position, save the waypoint, andturn it off. In this way the device is only used in emergency routefindingsituations.Here’s one last technique if you have brought your smart phone on a wildernessexcursion without first downloading the appropriate detailed maps and you areout of cell phone range. At the trailhead or starting point, start up one ofyour GPS apps, begin a “track” and observe the data to see if the device isindeed recording a track of your current location, even if within a blank grid.Walk a short distance and look to see if your indicated location has movedaccordingly. Then turn off your device as described earlier. Later on the trip,start up your phone and launch your GPS app. The original trailhead track shouldstill be visible. At a minimum, this should give you a good idea of the distanceand direction back to the starting point. We suggest that you test thistechnique at a familiar location before depending on it.Limitations of GPS Usage with Smart DevicesThe fundamental message here is that if you are accustomed to using your smartdevice in the city, within cell tower range, and with ample access to power, youcannot be afforded such luxuries in the wilderness, where a different mindset isrequired. Otherwise, you may turn on your smart device to take a photo of abeautiful scene, only to discover that your smart device is automaticallypowering down because it has so little battery power remaining.The main point here is that you do not want to be in a situation in which youdiscover yourself lost in the wilderness and turn on your smart phone to somehowbail yourself out, without having somehow recorded your starting point, plushaving the knowledge of how to use the device, and an understanding of itslimitations.Supplemental power sources exist for smart devices in the backcountry, includingexternal battery packs, integrated smart device protectors/supplemental batteryaccessories such as Mophie, electricitygenerating stoves, and solar chargers.But how much extra weight are you willing to carry? How will you attach andarrange a solar panel array on your backpack to charge your smart device? Willit be effective as you hike through a dense forest?CHAPTER SUMMARYGPS receivers are marvelous devices, and using them can significantly aidwilderness navigation. Keep in mind, however, that they are not foolproof, andthat topography, forest cover, battery life, electronic failure, coldtemperatures, and inadequate user knowledge can prevent their effective use. AGPS receiver cannot replace conventional map and compass techniques.Conventional paper maps and baseplate compasses work at temperatures well belowzero, require no batteries, and are so simple that there is very little that cango wrong with them. In addition, compasses are so lightweight and inexpensivethat every party member can carry one. They are easy to operate and understand,and they function in even the thickest of forests. GPS devices can be extremelyhelpful in wilderness navigation, but the map and compass remain thecornerstones of navigation and wilderness routefinding.SKILLS CHECK•Does a GPS device replace the need for a topo map?•Does a GPS device replace the need for a compass?•Is the GPS (or location services) app on smart phones just as good as adedicated GPS receiver?•When using a basic GPS receiver that does not display topo maps, how can youdetermine your exact position?•What do WAAS, EGNOS, and SBAS have in common?•List three things you can do to increase battery life in GPS receivers."},{"pageContent":"Chapter10Wilderness RoutefindingCHAPTER OBJECTIVES•Learn how to properly prepare for trips in the wilderness.•Explain the importance of having an agreed-upon turnaround time.•Learn how to routefind on the trail, in the forest, in the desert, in alpineareas, and on snow and glaciers.•Explain how careful identification of bootprints can aid in wildernessroutefinding.•Describe the art of wilderness routefinding.TRIP PLANNING AND PREPARATIONRoutefinding begins at home. Before heading out the door, you need to know notonly the name of your wilderness destination but also a great deal about how toget there and back. This information is accessible to anyone who takes the timeto seek it out, from guidebooks and maps and from people who have been there.Any off-trail trip requires a route plan, that is, a well-thought-out procedurefor how you will navigate to your destination and back. This includesidentifying handrails that you will be following, baselines or catch lines thatyou could head to in the event of an emergency (see chapter 5[part0012.html#BE6O0-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5]), route-markingmaterials, compass bearings that you might need to follow, GPS coordinates ofcrucial locations, and any other navigational aids.Up-to-date guidebooks provide critical information such as a description of theroute, the estimated time necessary to complete it, elevation gain, distance,and so forth. Travelers who have previously made the trip may be able to tellyou about landmarks, hazards, and routefinding hassles. Useful details arepacked into maps of all sorts: Forest Service, road, aerial, sketch, andtopographic. For a trip into an area that is particularly unfamiliar to you,more preparation is needed. This might include scouting into the area,observations from distant vantage points, or a study of aerial photographs orsatellite imagery, from such internet sites as Google Earth.If the route comes from a guidebook or from a description provided by anotherperson or a website such as WTA’s trip reports, plot it out on the topographicmap you will be carrying, noting trail junctions and other important points. Itcan help to highlight the route with a yellow felt-tip marking pen, which doesnot obliterate map features. Additional maps or route descriptions marked withnotes about any more up-to-date information should be taken, along with the topomap. In selecting the route, consider a host of factors including the season,weather and route conditions, the abilities of party members, and the equipmentavailable.You should not let outdated information ruin your trip. Check beforehand withthe appropriate agencies about roads and trails, especially closures, and alsoabout off-trail routes, regulations, permits, and camping requirements.Turnaround TimeEvery wilderness adventure, however simple or sublime, must have a predeterminedagreed-upon turnaround time. This is the time of day when the party must turnaround in order to return to the trailhead, camp, or other planned destinationbefore dark. Everyone in your group should know this time and agree to it. Yourobjective plays an important role in the determination of this time. Forexample, if your destination is a car parked at a trailhead above tree line,then you have an extra half hour to work with since it will still be light forabout a half hour after sunset. However, if your destination is a campsite thatyou must set up in a thick forest, then you need to be more conservative.Visible light in a thick forest can dim about a half hour before sunset.Furthermore, you will need time to set up camp, purify water, prepare dinner,and plan the route for the next day.Turnaround time should be based on the amount of available light during the day.In order to determine your safe turnaround time, first find the time of sunset.Then figure out how long you think it will take for you to get from yourobjective to the trailhead or camp. Add in an hour or two for lunch breaks andrest stops. On a steep climb, a good general rule is that it will take half thetime to descend as it took to ascend the same route. For a level route, a nearlyequal time may be required. Add the descent time to your anticipated ascent timeand add in an hour or so for unplanned emergencies. For example, suppose youplan on a four-hour ascent time with two hours of descent time, on a day whenthe sun rises at 8 a.m. and sets at 6 p.m. With an extra hour for good measure,this puts your turnaround time at 3 p.m. at the latest. With more experience youwill learn the capabilities of your team members, but it is wise to start outconservatively for maximum safety.On a typical glacier or snow climb, your turnaround time may be as early as 10a.m. to avoid soft snow conditions on the descent. This often entails a predawnstart. If the ascent is expected to require eight hours, with four hours ofdescent time, you may want to return to camp by noon, which would necessitate amidnight start time.Return RouteAs a general rule, it is best to return from your objective by means of the sameroute that you take to your objective. If so, you will be knowledgeable aboutroute conditions, trail junctions, and any potential routefinding pitfalls. Thatsaid, however, there are times when you might not want to follow the same routeback from your objective. For example, the route might be a technical climb viaa challenging route, and it makes sense to follow an easier route back. Orperhaps you have chosen to take a “scenic loop trip” on which you will neverstep on the same section of the route twice. Such trips can be incrediblyinteresting and satisfying, but require extra caution.If you do not follow the same route on your return, be sure to carefully studythe entire route beforehand, and be aware of places where you might get off thecorrect route. Be particularly careful of the amount of route remaining, giventhe pace at which you will be traveling. If there is any doubt as to whether youwill be able to complete the route in the allotted time, you may have to turnaround before your halfway point, or potentially hike out in the dark overunfamiliar terrain (which is not recommended).ON THE TRAILWhen following trails, be sure to make a mental note of all trail junctions, orjot down such essential information as you hike, as can be done on a smallnotebook made of waterproof paper, which is ideal for such purposes. Somejunctions are indistinct, unmarked, or obscure. Others, though marked withsigns, are easy to miss if you are in a hurry or not paying close attention.When following a good trail through nondescript territory, it is easy to getinto a form of mental autopilot, in which you just keep on walking withouttaking much note of features you are passing. In such conditions, it is easy tomiss trail junctions and wander off onto the wrong trail. Try to avoid this byremaining alert to your surroundings and always searching for trail junctionsand other noteworthy features.At clearings in the forest, trail junctions, stream crossings, passes, and otherknown locations, locate your position on the map (orient yourself). Be observantof the topography that you pass, and always have the topo map available withouthaving to remove your pack. For example, you may see a ridge or a gully comingdown a mountainside, and you can glance at your map to note that you are passingsuch a feature. In addition to helping you to keep track of your position, thispractice will eventually make you an expert map reader.When traveling in a group, follow reasonable precautions to avoid anyone gettinglost, such as assigning a responsible person known as a “sweep” to travel behindthe slowest member, instructing party members to wait at important points alongthe way, and other measures covered in more detail in chapter 5[part0012.html#BE6O0-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5].When the trail becomes lost in snow, blowdowns, overgrown brush, or rocks orshale, there are still ways to find and stay on track other than just followinga well-beaten trail. One way is to look for tree blazes—slashes, usually made byan ax (or sometimes by a paintbrush or spray paint), normally on trees about 6feet (2 kilometers) or so above ground level, or on rocks on the ground. Anothertelltale sign are the prunings that occasionally are visible, where tree limbshave been cut during trail maintenance operations. If neither of these helps youto stay on the trail, ask yourself, “If I were a trail, where would I be?” Trailbuilders usually locate trails on the easiest terrain, with a minimum of ups anddowns, and with the least amount of effort. Remembering this may help you torelocate the trail. If you do lose the trail in brush, woods, or snow, then youshould immediately stop, retrace your steps, and locate the last known trailposition. It is often tempting to keep pressing on, with the notion that thetrail will eventually emerge. But this is rarely the case. Go back and find thetrail and then start the process of finding the true route to your destination,whether back on the original trail or by some other route.Even if the trail is muddy or full of puddles, it is strongly recommended thatyou stay on the trail, walking right through the puddles, even if it meansgetting your feet wet. (The inconvenience of this practice is lessened bywearing appropriate footwear: good, solid, waterproofed boots that will not soakthrough when you walk through water, or lightweight trail shoes that dry easilyand quickly.) Walking off the trail to find dry spots eventually createsmultiple parallel paths and can create a severe human impact on the wilderness.In addition, be careful not to damage trailside vegetation—for example, takerest stops at places with rocks or logs, or at open, bare areas, rather than atplaces where you might damage trailside vegetation. Practice sound Leave NoTrace principles to minimize the impact of your presence.IN THE FORESTThe moment you step off the road or trail and enter the forest, remind yourselfthat you are leaving your handrail, and you need to look for another one. Thenew handrail could be a topographic feature, such as a ridge, gully, or stream.In the total absence of real, physical handrails, you can conceivably follow aninvisible, abstract, handrail such as a contour line (by keeping level, neithergaining nor losing elevation) or a compass bearing. If you do this, be sure tomake a note of the elevation and/or bearing that you are following. Never merelywander off into the woods with no clear idea of the direction in which you areheaded. You will also need a new baseline; this might be the road or trail thatwas your previous handrail.It is best to try to follow topographic features when choosing a route in theforest. To avoid heavy brush, try to follow ridges and dense, old-growth timber.Gullies, watercourses, and second growth may be choked with lush, difficultvegetation. You may encounter remnants of trails from time to time. If so, takeadvantage of them, since doing so may save you time and energy. But keep in mindthat the destination of such trails may well be different from yours,particularly if you are following game trails. If the trail starts to deviatetoo much from your intended direction of travel, be prepared to leave it andhead back to off-trail travel.It may sound self-evident and trite, but you should always remember that if youknow where you are, you are not lost. So always keep track of your positionusing topography, time, vegetation, elevation, and any other means at yourdisposal. For example, you might jot down the following notes as you follow theroute to your objective:•Into woods at elev 2900 ft and bearing of 250°•At elev 3500 ft travel level terrain at 310°•Ascend forested ridge to broad bench at 4800 ftBe sure to consult the map at frequent intervals to find each topographicfeature that you encounter. Record your route in your notebook or on your map.Noting the direction of the slope may be of particular value in determining yourposition when known landmarks are obscured by forest or fog. The route will lookentirely different on your return, but with the aid of your map, compass,notebook, and perhaps your altimeter or GPS device, you should be able to getback to your starting point without difficulty.Mark the route if necessary. When traveling in the forest, it is particularlyunlikely that you will follow exactly the same path on your return as on yourway in, unless the topography of the area is very distinct. For this reason, itis essential to use natural materials, such as branches and logs, orbiodegradable markers such as toilet paper, which deteriorates without leaving atrace.If you have a GPS receiver, take the time at the start of your trek to establisha waypoint or landmark. This may be possible at the road where you leave yourcar. If not, then at least read the UTM coordinates off the map and enter thislocation as a starting point. Later, if necessary, you can establish a newposition and ask the receiver to tell you the compass bearing to your startingpoint.Remember to keep your map and compass handy as you travel in the forest. If youcarry them in your pack, you will not use them as often as you should, since youwill not want to stop frequently to remove your pack. If the route is difficult,with brush, fallen trees, or other obstacles to climb over and under, it isespecially important that you not carry your compass with its lanyard aroundyour neck, due to safety concerns. Your pocket is a far better place for it.Enjoying the forest in the winter, early spring, or late fall can be a wonderfulexperience. The air is crisp and cold. Snow covers the forest floor. The bugsare gone as are the majority of travelers. However, there is one distinctdisadvantage to traveling through a forest with snow obscuring the trail: theroutefinding can be extremely challenging. With snow over the trail andlandmarks and other objects obscured by forest, the route can be difficult tofollow. Wands are very hard to follow in a forest. Further, some GPS receiverswill not work well in a dense forest. The map and altimeter may be your besttools.Begin honing your skills by traveling on snow-covered trails with which you arefamiliar. When en route, continually ask yourself where you would be if you werea trail. The moment that you are in unfamiliar terrain, retrace your route to apoint at which you are familiar. If you know the direction to your destinationthen blaze your own trail, but do not expect that your tracks will berecognizable for the return (see “The Bootprint,” later in this chapter). Youmay need to find a new, and better, route for the return. Keep an eye out forthe trail markers, trail signage, blazes in trees, and significant landmarks onwhich to take compass bearings. Be on the lookout for signs of trailcraft suchas sawed logs, bridges, severed limbs, and other signs of human travel orconstruction. Slow your pace and be diligent. Take existing footprints with agrain of salt; they are just another clue as to where the route may go. Alwaysassume that the travelers who made the existing footprints were lost, until youprove otherwise. Reorient yourself with the smallest sign of a trail—a bridge, atrail marker, or other landmark—and, most importantly, routefind with an openmind.IN THE DESERTRoutefinding in the desert can be easy when clear weather conditions allow youto see far-off landforms. But you should never count on such conditions. Suddensandstorms and downpours occasionally occur, and if you are assuming that youwill have good visibility for all of your routefinding you can easily get intotrouble. For this reason it is crucial for you to follow well-established trailsor other handrails, or definite topographical features rather than to merelyassume that you can always just aim for far-off visible features.A prime consideration for any desert travel is the proximity to water. A goodguideline is to carry at least 1 gallon (4 liters) of water per person per dayunless a dependable source of drinking water is available. There is a practicallimit to how much weight you can carry, so the availability of good water alongyour chosen route is often a deciding factor in desert routefinding,particularly for extended trips.The wide-open views in the desert make GPS usage easy and dependable. Underthese conditions, it is most advisable to carry and frequently use a GPS deviceof some kind. (However, GPS devices do not work well, if at all, in deepcanyons, for instance.) If following a poorly marked trail or dubious naturalfeatures, it might be advisable to leave your GPS receiver on continuously so asto record your exact track. If you plan on doing this, be sure to carry an extrasupply of batteries, preferably longer-lasting lithium cells. You can also carrya supply of previously charged nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) rechargeable cells—awise investment if you use a lot of battery-operated devices. Just remember torecharge them before leaving home. You might very well need them.IN ALPINE AREASMany of the same suggestions offered above for forests and deserts also apply toalpine areas. First, find and follow a route using natural topographic featureswherever possible. You can use ridges, gullies, streams, and other readilyidentifiable features as handrails. Even if the route appears to be obvious,pause now and then to look at the map and find your location, and observe thetopographic features that you are using on your route. The sudden arrival ofclouds may turn an obvious route into a challenging navigational problem. Markyour route on the map in pencil, perhaps even noting the time of arrival atvarious places along the route. Remember that you should be able to identifyyour position on the map as closely as possible at any point of your trip.If you must deviate from natural topographic features, then use your compass tofind the bearing that you will be following on the next leg of your trip. Make anote of this bearing in your notebook or on the map. If you have an altimeter,look at it often and follow your progress on the map. Ask yourself frequentlywhat you would do if fog or clouds suddenly came in and obscured your view ofthe return route. How would you recognize key points at which you need to makecrucial route changes? Should you be marking the route at such places? Shouldyou be saving GPS waypoints?In selecting the route, try to minimize the impact of your party on the terrain.Many alpine areas are particularly fragile. Some delicate woody plants, such asheather, grow only a fraction of an inch (a few millimeters) each season, and afew thoughtless footprints may wipe out an entire season’s growth. If there isany trail at all, use it to minimize your impact. In the absence of a trail, tryto stick to rocks, scree, talus, or snow to avoid stomping on fragilevegetation. If you must travel over alpine growth, disperse your party tominimize your personal impact as much as possible.Open alpine areas are excellent places to use GPS receivers. At every rest stop,and at important route changes, take the opportunity to turn on your receiverand obtain a satellite fix. Save these locations as waypoints. In the event thatyou wander off route, you may be able to acquire a new position fix. Then yourreceiver will be able to tell you the new bearing to any of your previouslyestablished waypoints.ON SNOWAlways be aware of potential avalanche conditions. If a slope has snow on it,then it has the possibility of sliding, often with deadly results. Slopes with agrade of about 50 percent to 170 percent (an angle of about 25° to 60°) have ahigh likelihood of sliding, so always be aware of the grade of the slope—and notjust the slope you are on, but more importantly the slope above you. The mostextreme hazard occurs when the slope grade is about 70 percent to 100 percent—anangle of 35° to 45°—so be particularly wary on slopes in this range. (Chapter 6includes techniques for measuring the grade of a slope on a map, and chapter 7[part0014.html#DB7S0-c2f370fff0774a659f6f6a6700cadcc5] explains the use of acompass’s clinometer for measuring the actual angle of a slope.)Many times you can follow previous bootprints in the snow to find the properroute. Even if they are several days old, an observant navigator can sometimespick them out from sun cups and still follow the route. (Reading bootprints iscovered in more detail in “The Bootprint,” later in this chapter.) Vaguebootprints will sometimes have a uniform indentation and may have a distinct,subtle ring of dust in them. But it is still your responsibility to know yourapproximate location and direction at all times. A wilderness navigator who usesthe excuse “It’s not my fault that we’re lost—I was following tracks!” needs toread this book again before venturing out on another trek.Following a route that has been put in on a snowfield is often academic: simplyfollow the bootprints. But prints are rarely permanent and can degrade quicklyunder some conditions. Sometimes the tracks you follow turn out to leadsomewhere other than your objective. Wind and newly fallen snow can obliteratetracks, sometimes only a few seconds after they are created. The sun, especiallyat higher altitudes, can also erase tracks. This can be particularly surprisingon a summer day when you thought that your descent following your tracks wouldbe a piece of cake, only to find on your return trip that your footprints havemelted out and have become intermingled with existing sun cups. Fortunately forthe wilderness traveler, with a little homework and a few navigational tools youwill be able to find your way back.The best tools for routefinding on snow are the map and compass. By takingbearings on an intermediate objective such as a pass or a rock outcropping, youcan navigate toward that objective even if clouds move in. If you write downthose compass bearings, then on the return trip you can easily follow the backbearings for each consecutive leg and make it back. Another tool forroutefinding on snow is the altimeter. The clouds have rolled in, and you presson until reaching what you hope is the summit. But a quick check of thealtimeter shows that you are 700 feet (200 meters) lower than the printed summiton the map (assuming a stable barometric pressure). A look at the map shows afalse summit 500 feet (150 m) lower than the true summit. It is likely that youhave not quite made it yet.A GPS receiver can be a big help on snow and in whiteouts. The GPS receiver cangive you a pretty good idea of where you are, and where to go, but only if youhave saved the proper waypoints. By entering important positions, such as thelocation of your camp, the receiver can guide you to your objective and back. Onlong trips when conserving battery power is a concern, you can obtain the properbearing to your destination from the GPS receiver, set the bearing on yourcompass, and then follow it using your compass.Capable, cautious wilderness navigators will develop the skills to use their mapand compass and GPS devices, and possibly other devices (such as wands,whistles, etc.) as a complete system, rather than as independent tools.WandsYou may occasionally have difficulty retracing your ascent route when on anindistinct snowfield where your bootprints are obliterated by wind, sun, or newsnow. In this case, a dependable way to follow your ascent route is to followtall, thin stakes called wands. Think of a set of wands as a portable handrailthat you place on the ascent. Most people make their own wands out of 3-footgreen bamboo sticks purchased at any gardening store. Two bags of darkly stainedbamboo sticks will usually yield twenty-five really good wands, once you haveweeded out the flimsy and knotted ones. (Any potential wand deemed inappropriatefor alpine use will happily serve its life in your garden.)images [../images/00090.jpeg]Figure 78. A wand with a duct tape flagTo make the wands more visible, cut a 6-inch piece of brightly colored duct tapeand make a flag at the top of the stick by folding the duct tape back overitself (figure 78 [part0017.html#fig78]). To discern your wands from anyoneelse’s, you can mark each flag with your initials and the date (e.g., MB 2015).Wands can be carried behind the compression straps of your pack, where you canreach them for easy placement without removing your pack.Wands are placed with the descent in mind, so place wands where they will bevisible on the return trip. It is always better to place the wand on the top ofa small rise rather than in a hollow. Beware of background features such asrocks or trees that can cause the wand to blend in with its surroundings. Yourwands should be as easy as possible to spot and follow. One helpful trick is toangle the wand slightly toward the previously placed wand. On your return, ifyou cannot see the next wand, you will have a pretty good idea of the directionto it. If you still cannot see the next wand, then have the party wait at thelast wand and cautiously search for the next one, always remaining in sight orwithin shouting distance of the rest of the party. Wait until you find the wand,and then proceed to the next one. It is all too easy for a party to rush down anindistinct snow slope and lose the wands under poor conditions. Once lost, itcan be difficult to find the wanded trail again.If the party is roped up, then a good general rule is to place the wands nofarther apart than the combined length of the rope teams. If the terrain doesnot warrant roping up, then the safety margin must be increased and the wandsplaced so that you can see at least one and preferably a second wand from eachsuccessive wand. It is easiest to find successive wands if they are placed atapproximately equal intervals, so that you know where and when to look for them.This might require counting paces between wands to space them at predictableintervals.If you find that you are running out of wands, then try to supplement the wandsyou have by using natural terrain features. Perhaps you can place a few wands atregular intervals on an indistinct snowfield until reaching a distinctridgeline. Then you can follow the ridgeline without placing any wands until itsend. At this point you may elect to build a small temporary cairn to mark theroute. Another way to conserve wands is to set one wand in a good spot, thentake a compass bearing toward your previous wand and place a second wand about afoot (30 cm) from the last one, with the wands lined up to point toward theprevious one. To follow the course back, simply take the compass bearing thatthe two wands create and follow that bearing to the previous wand(s). In thisway you can place pairs of wands farther apart than single wands.The party should always carry enough wands to make it to the destination. Thenumber of wands depends greatly on the length and complexity of the route. It isnot uncommon for a party to carry a hundred wands for a long route. If you arein a party of four, that is only twenty-five wands per person.Wands left behind are considered litter. Always be sure to remove all your wandson the descent. Conversely, never remove someone else’s wands, since they aredepending on them for their descent. If you encounter someone else’s wand thathas melted out of the snow and has fallen over, place it upright again. Do notexpect to follow somebody else’s wands. They may remove them on the descentahead of you, leaving you stranded. You and your party should be responsible forgetting to and from your destination using your own resources.It is possible that you may run out of wands before you reach your destination.Perhaps the conditions warrant more wands than you had anticipated. If this isthe case, the party must decide a proper course of action. Perhaps you can useanother form of navigation, such as taking a bearing from the last placed wandtoward your known destination. Careful study of the map or an altimeter readingmay help. Perhaps a GPS receiver can show you the way. Remember that the GPSreceiver is not a panacea. It may not be accurate enough to indicate theposition of your last placed wand.ON GLACIERSAs the route ascends high above tree line and onto snowfields, the routefindingbecomes easier. Snow covers the talus and protects the fragile meadows. But anew hazard may be lurking underneath: crevasses. Many times there is atraditional roping up point that divides the nontechnical ascent from thetechnical. At other times, in the absence of a terminal or lateral moraine, andespecially in early season, it may be difficult to determine exactly where thesnowfield ends and the glacier begins. Find your position on the map, and checkyour elevation as indicated on your altimeter or GPS device. Does your map showthat you are on a glacier—a white area with a dashed blue boundary line and bluecontour lines? (Note that some glaciers have boundaries that may have changedsince the map was last updated, so do not trust such dashed lines if using anold map.) Rope up for all glacier travel! This next section assumes that you aretied in to the climbing rope.The tools and techniques used for routefinding on snow can be used on glaciersas well. You will have two primary concerns while traveling on glaciers. One isthat the route is as efficient as possible, as straight a line as the team canhandle, leading to your objective. The second, and sometimes contradictoryconcern is that the route should avoid objective hazards such as below majoricefall areas, cornices, melt streams, bergschrunds, and avalanche slopes, andshould travel over as few crevasses as possible.Many times, just as on snow, a previous route can be followed. Often, on popularglacier routes, the route will be a well-paved “trail” along the glaciersurface. Sometimes it is so good that it forms a veritable pathway, making anotherwise steep and tricky traverse an easy walk.Occasionally, if the route is old or if it is late in the season, it will end ata gaping crevasse, the sign of a collapsed snow bridge. A new route will have tobe made over or around the crevasse in order to continue. Always be prepared toput in the route yourself.Crevasses tend to be most plentiful around turns and obstructions and near thesides of the glacier. Often, the center of the glacier may have a morehomogeneous bedrock base and thus fewer, albeit deeper, crevasses. Crevassestend to form in groups with their attitude perpendicular to the direction ofglacier flow.Sometimes, if there is a crevasse that has just begun to show itself, a previousparty may have placed two wands together forming an X. This is a warning tosteer clear—a crevasse is probably looming underneath the snow surface. Theproper way to travel around a known crevasse is to steer wide around it, a routecalled an end-run. Oftentimes on a glacier, a crevasse will exist beneath anotherwise unexplained dip in the snow surface. As you approach, keep theclimbing rope taut and probe the snow deeply with your ice ax, and look throughthe hole to see if there is a crevasse. Step wide over the dip. Tread lightlyand step over anything that you suspect may be a crevasse. Remember too that ifyou are putting in the route, then it is likely that many more will follow yourpath, perhaps even in your very footsteps. You should craft a route that ismanageable for all wilderness travelers, not just for the long-legged orathletic.While ascending, keep the descent path in mind. If you jump over a crevasse withuneven side walls, be sure that all party members will be able to jump over itagain on the descent. Additionally, you want your route to last for severaldays, not hours, and summertime glacier surface melt is often significant, up toseveral inches per day. For this reason it is best to make long end-runs andcross on thick snow bridges.Most prudent summit attempts on glacier routes are begun a few hours before thecoolest part of the day. With a cold air temperature, snow bridges are firmerand the glacier surface is more likely to be frozen over, making for smoothcramponing, instead of slushy postholing. Time your start so that your descentis completed well before the heat of the day. It is common for summit teams toleave high camp between midnight and four o’clock in the morning, summit, andreturn to high camp before noon.With a large party on an unblazed glacier route, it may be advantageous to senda scouting party ahead to put in the route. Alternatively, a small side tripmight yield an excellent vantage point from which to view the glacier from adistance. At such a point you may more easily see the big picture of where theroute should be heading as well as any major obstacles, such as icefalls, thatmust be avoided.MOATS AND BERGSCHRUNDSThe area between moving snow and ice masses and stationary features like rockridges, moraines, and summit ice caps is often defined by the existence of amoat or bergschrund.Moats form when rock, radiated by the sun, warms and melts the snow near it.Moats can be dozens of feet deep and can be difficult to see from below. Moatshave a propensity to swallow up ankles, legs, unsecured equipment, and sometimesclimbers. If you are on a snow surface approaching a rock feature, always assumethat a moat is lurking. As you approach the rock, probe the snow with your iceax and look through the hole to see if the rock is visible. Step wide over thegap. It may be advantageous to cross the precipice laterally or even downhill toget a wider stride.Bergschrunds commonly occur high on a mountain face. They are formed when themoving ice or snow mass separates from the summit ice or rock. Early in theseason they may be filled in with snow and crossing them may be academic; youmay not even notice them. But later in the season they can present challengingroutefinding problems. Sometimes a snow bridge may cross a bergschrund. Othertimes the safest course is to steer wide around them, perhaps even climbing onthe smooth rock at its end. Deep and wide bergschrunds can present such asignificant routefinding obstacle that the team may have to turn back. There isnot always a way around them.THE BOOTPRINTEvery bootprint tells a story. Bootprints can tell you a lot about who and whensomeone has walked the path before you. As you travel, pay attention to who isin front of you and what type of prints they are leaving. Pay attention to thesize, direction, and depth of the print, the shape of the sole, the distancebetween prints, and the style of the tread pattern. Was the person who leftthose prints tall or short? Was the person wearing a big, heavy pack, causingdeep prints? Or was he or she wearing tennis shoes? Do you know what your ownbootprint looks like? Could you follow it back after other people have made newprints on top of it?How can you tell if you are the first travelers of the day on any particularroute? Well, if the only prints that you see are facing you and look like theymay have been made the previous day, then chances are that you are the only onesup there.How far ahead is the next person? In the forest, if the tracks that you arefollowing are filling in with water from a puddle, then the hiker is rightaround the corner. If the prints have fir or pine needles or leaves on them,then they are older. If the tracks in the mud are drying and becoming lessdefined, then the party must be at least a few hours ahead of you.How does the energy level of your teammates measure up? If someone is ahead ofyou and wearing crampons, then you can make very specific observations abouttheir gait. Are there two long parallel streaks leading to the rear cramponmarks? This may indicate a party member who is getting tired. The importantpoint here is to be aware. Use all the information that is available, not justwhat is obvious.Once, a large group was ascending a trail. One member had to stop to make aclothing adjustment. He told everyone to continue on. One other experiencedparty member waited with him. The two began to follow after a few minutes. Theroute began to be obscured by snow, but the tracks from the party ahead werefresh and easy to follow. Then the tracks split into two different directions.Both sets of tracks were made at about the same time. (It was a popular route.)“Which way do we go?” the less experienced man asked. The more experienced manknelt down and carefully examined the two paths, without disturbing them. Hereached down and touched some of the prints, testing them and seeing how thesnow had formed in the spaces between where the cleats of the boot had left theprints. “They went this way,” the experienced man pointed. “How do you know?”the other man asked.The more experienced man explained that he had noticed that the last person inthe group that they were following was a woman who was wearing the same style ofboot that he was wearing, only it was about five sizes smaller. The odds ofsomeone else having the same size and style of boot as that woman at that houron that trail were low. Therefore, they went that way. All they needed to do wasto follow those same prints. The two followed the unique prints and after a fewminutes they caught up with their group. If the two of them had simply blunderedalong, unaware of the tracks that they were following, they might have missedtheir group’s turn and might have had to double back after not finding them. Butbecause of experience and awareness, they were able to find their group withlittle trouble.Know your own bootprint. And know the bootprints of other members of your party.You may not be able to pick out every step taken along the way, but chances areyou will be able to discern between ascending and descending prints, and moreimportantly, any changes in the prints that you are following.CHAPTER SUMMARYOrientation and navigation are sciences that can be easily mastered by anyonewho takes the time, and makes the effort, to learn map reading and the use ofthe compass and other navigational tools. Practice and time spent on thesesubjects will enable anyone to become proficient with them. Routefinding isdifferent. It is an art.Some individuals seem to be born with an innate gift for finding and following aroute on trails, through the forest, in the desert, in alpine regions, and onsnow and glaciers. The natural abilities of such people can be greatly enhancedif they thoroughly learn the sciences of orientation and navigation, throughmastery of the map, compass, and other tools. Such knowledge can enable a goodroutefinder to become a great one.Some people are not blessed with great natural ability in routefinding. Butthere is hope for them, too. Through study and practice, they can also becomeproficient in orientation and navigation. They can even become experts in theuse of the map and compass, if they expend the time and effort required to doso. Then, with time and experience, they can acquire much of the art ofroutefinding, particularly if they travel in the company of good routefinders,observing and learning as they do. Above all, there is no substitute forexperience and practice.We encourage you to reread and study this book carefully, learning the sciencesof map reading, compass use, orientation and navigation, and possibly the use ofother navigational tools such as the altimeter and the GPS. But this book is notenough. Repeated practice and considerable experience are necessary tothoroughly develop the skills and acquire the self-confidence that comes withrepeated use of the principles described in this book. So go out into thewilderness and put the principles of Wilderness Navigation into practice—atfirst, perhaps, on good trails, then progressing to off-trail travel withever-increasing routefinding challenges. Eventually, whether you are anatural-born routefinder or not, you can become thoroughly adept at map andcompass use and will at least possess the knowledge and experience to avoidgetting lost—and to recover gracefully from the experience if you ever do. Andwho knows, someday you might become a great routefinder, able to successfullynavigate your way to any destination, solving all problems along the way, andmake it back to your starting point with little difficulty or incident—becauseyou planned it that way.SKILLS CHECK•List four things you can do when planning a wilderness trip that will aid youduring your trip.•What is the difference between a baseline and a handrail?•What is a “sweep”?•If you lose a trail in the snow, how can you find it again?•What is a route plan?•Why is it important to establish a turnaround time?"},{"pageContent":"BibliographyThese are only a few of the many books available on the subject matter containedin this guide.
