[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":" Constructing Raised Garden Beds We conveniently situated our garden between the greenhou se and the barn . After experiencing the severity of the high desert cli mate, we decided that our best shot at successful outdoor gardening would be with raised garde n beds. Withstanding the Elements I'm not exaggerating, more than half of the days this year h ave been exceptionally windy. We're not sure if this is a trend that will be exacerbated by climate change or if it was an anomaly. Either knock down trellising. At an altitude of 5500' the sun's i ntensity is also a concern. Plants often bake in the sun and their fruit is prone to sunburn. Other elements to take into account are hail and pelting rain. We experience hail pouring rain can also damage plants. With all this in mind, we designed raised garden beds tha t are framed out to 8' feet high. Shade cloth, wind barri ers and trellising materials can be easily attached the sturdy frames. In addition, our fi rst set of six spanned over the top. Constructing Raised Garden Beds Each of the 4' x 8' raised beds are constructed from pine lum ber that has been sanded, primed and painted with exterior house paint. The interior of the raised beds are protected increase the depth by adding another 2\" x 8\" board. The cor ner posts are 4\" x 4\" and are connected at the top by a 2\" x 4\" frame. Four stakes driven into the ground abut each of the garden bed s and are used to Building Soil for Garden Beds By far the toughest part of the job has been creating fert ile soil to fill each of the raised garden beds. We experim ented with strawbale planting and filled several of the garden beds with whole bales. All in all we w ere not pleased with the local sand with goat manure from a nearby farm along with composted kitchen scraps and straw. Future garden beds will rely on manure created by our breeding rabbits and o rganic material from Planting, Harvest & Seed Saving in Raised Beds Planting and harvesting in raised beds is a lot easier on t he body than working in a garden that has been sown direct ly in the ground. There is a lot less kneeling and bending over, which makes gardening a lot more enjoya ble. Another issue we've had with our in-ground beds are mischievo us cats. The raised beds are less susceptible to attack and are easier to protect. In fact, we are designing hardware cloth panels that can be attached to th e garden bed frames. In future years we hope to practice seed saving. We will be making screen panels that attach to each of the frames to prevent cross pollination by roaming insects. Cold Frames for Raised Beds With winter approaching we are also designing panels that can be attached to our garden beds to act as cold frames. With this method we hope to extend our growing sea son at least be Page 1 of 2 Constructing Raised Garden Beds - Raised Bed Gardening - Raised Bed Vegetable Garde ... 10/27/2008 http://www.byexample.com/homestead/gardens/construc ting_raised_garden_beds.html"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" Click here to download a PDF version of our raised garden bed plans.
