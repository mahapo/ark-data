It is the know-how, things-to-do-with and economy that count. Labor-saving machinery has revo lutionized many a trade and industry. It has made farming an industry and a science of po ssibilities undreamed of and unattainable a hundred years ago. But it is not eno ugh for the modern farm to be equipped with the best tools and machinery that shops and fa ctories turn out, to know how to use them and keep them in repair. There are many handy devices, not made in any factory and not sold in any store, that every intelligent man c an make himself, which save money and labor and time. Inventive men are constantly contri ving simple but valuable things to meet the needs of their own practical experience. We are all the time hunting after and gathering these ideas. Now we are putting a lot of the best o nes into this book. We are trying, by words and pictures, to explain clearly just how to make each device. Everything described is tried and practical. Some are old, many are new, al l are good for the purpose intended. They represent the practical, successful experience of f armers and other wide-awake workers all over the United States. This book is broader than its title. The overflow o f good measure includes a valuable chapter on the steel square and its uses. Nowhere e lse has this subject been handled in a way so easily understood, with confusing mathematics cu t out. We especially commend this chapter to our readers. We also present some good h ouse and barn plans, that will be appreciated by those who contemplate building. In addition to the direct benefit to be derived fro m doing what the book tells how to do, we have in mind the larger purpose of education toward putting more thought into our work and doing what we have to do the easiest, the cheap est and the quickest way. Out of it all, we trust our readers will make progress toward grea ter prosperity, greater happiness and greater usefulness. Contents by Chapters 1.

So, in this book, we are going to start with carpenter tools and the place to keep and use them. Every farmer ought to have a workshop in whic h he can do odd jobs and make things when the weather prevents out-of-door work, or at t imes when there is little to do on the farm. Economy and thrift demand that a farmer shoul d have and keep in good condition a few essential carpenter tools. First of all he shou ld have a long, strong, smooth-top bench and, either on racks above the bench or in a tool c hest, he should keep in order, and where he can easily find them when wanted, his stock of c arpenter tools. Some of the tools that will be found useful are the following: A rip saw, a crosscut saw, a back saw, and a compas s saw; a jack plane, a fore plane, and a smoothing plane; a shave or drawing knife; two or t hree chisels of different sizes for woodworking and a cold chisel for metal; a gouge or two; a good hatchet; two or three hammers, including a tack hammer and a bell-faced c law hammer; a brace or bit stock with a set of half a dozen or more bits of different siz es; one or more gimlets; a mallet; a nail set, a large screw driver and a small one; a gauge; a sp irit level; a miter box; a good carpenter's square -- No. 100 is a good standard size; compasse s or dividers; cut nippers, a pair of small pincers and a pair of large ones; a rasp; a large, flat file; at least one medium-sized three- cornered file and a half-round file. It is poor economy to buy cheap tools. Of course ex travagance is to be avoided, but be sure that you get first-class material in every tool you buy. It is a good plan to get a good practical carpenter to assist you in selecting your tools. Keep on hand in the shop a variety of nails, brads and tacks, screws, rivets, bolts, w ashers and nuts, and such small articles of builders' hardware that are likely to be needed occasionally, including hinges, hasps and staples and some sandpaper. Have a good plumb line, chalk and pencils. Keep in a handy place a jar of a good liquid glue, and some cement. See to it that the shop contains a good stock of well-seasoned lumber, both hard wood and s oft. Attached to the bench should be a bench screw or vise. This need not be an expensive one, but should be of good size and strong. There should also be a pair of carpenter's saw benches, a shaving horse, a small Small farms Page 1 of 7 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 1 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices1.html"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"anvil and a grindstone. Every farmer has a grindsto ne somewhere about the buildings, but it is a great convenience to have a good one in the wo rkshop. A corner of the shop should be devoted to painting supplies, including several colors of good standard ready-mixed paints and stains, raw li nseed oil, boiled linseed oil, turpentine, varnish, putty, points for setting glass, several brushes of different sizes, a good putty kn ife and panes of glass of different sizes ready for emergen cy. A farmer ought to be able to do occasional little j obs of soldering. He needs soldering iron, a bar of solder, resin, a little bottle of solderin g fluid, which can be purchased already prepared, also a small sheet-iron furnace in which to heat the soldering iron. It would cost quite a tidy sum to buy all these thi ngs at once, but they can be gradually accumulated as one is able to purchase them, and th en the outfit should be kept complete. Whenever anything in the shop is broken, worn out, or disappears it should be replaced. Whenever farm implements or anything about the barn or house are broken or out of order, they should be properly fixed. Often a few minutes spent at the right time will make a thing almost as good as new, while, if neglected, it may soon get beyond repair and have to be thrown away. A thrifty farmer always keeps his farm implements well housed and in repair. It is not what we earn, but what we save, that make s us rich. It is quite as important to stop the leaks as it is to figure on big profits directl y. Running the Grindstone If the face of the grindstone is hard and glazed po ur a little sand on the stone every few minutes until the glaze is worn off and the stone w ill cut like a new one. This condition is caused by exposing the stone to the weather. It is best to keep the stone in a shed under cover, but if this is not possible, set it under a tree and put a box over it when not in use. It is surprising how easy a little oil on the bearings will make the stone run. A few drops of kerosene will cut the gum if it runs hard and then some oil or axle grease will make it go easy. It is hard to stand on one foot and work the treadl e with the other. The job can be made easy by bolting two boards to the grindstone frame, and extending it 2 feet, on which place a seat as shown in the cut. An uneven stone needs to be cu t down and toned up. This can be done by grinding against the end of a piece of pipe, hav ing the stone dry. Good nature is as contagious as the measles. Put on your best smile when you get up in the morning and observe how everybody will greet you wi th a sunny face.

This affair will s tand a lot of heavy pounding, and comes in handy in many ways. The rail is just about the righ t shape to make an anvil. Making a New Tool A very handy wrench for many kinds of work, such as making gates and contrivances, where small bolts are used, is shown in the cut. Fr om a small monkey wrench remove the wooden handle, and weld the metal part to an old bi t-stock, as shown in the cut. This permits of very rapid work in screwing up small bol ts. Where there are so many things to do as there are on a farm, it pays to do things in the easiest and quickest way. This is one of the real time-savers. Learn to live, and live to learn, Ignorance like a fire doth burn, Little tasks make large return. -- Bayard Taylor. How to Make a Shaving Horse Page 3 of 7 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 1 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices1.html"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" One of the most useful devices on a farm is a shavi ng horse. Make a bench 18 inches high of a good 2-inch plank, c, level off the edges so that it will make a comforta ble seat. Upon this place a slanting platform, b, through which is cut a hole in which the clamp, a, works. The clamp must be made of heavy hard wood that is t ough and will not split. The shank, f , must be an extension of the clamp, a . Several holes in the plank will allow the clamp t o be raised so as to take in larger pieces of wood. The treadle, g, is kept in place by a peg at h. To operate this horse the workman places his foot upon the treadle, inserts the wood to be clamped under the edge of a , and pushes backward upon the treadle. This clamps the wood and the drawing knife can be used readily and much more rapidly than with a vise. A Convenient Farm Horse On the farm there is continual use for such a horse as is shown in the drawing. Not only when doing little jobs of carpentering, but also in many other operations, such a support is found necessary. This little horse is an improvemen t over the ordinary stiff affair, in that it shuts together when not in use, and so can be packe d out of the way. It is made of boards cut in strips, the two horizon tal boards at the top being hinged together, as shown herewith. While in use the legs are kept a part by long hooks, as may be plainly seen in the picture. When tillage begins, other arts follow. The farmers , therefore, are the founders of human civilization. -- Daniel Webster. A Wire Splicer The neatest and strongest splice can be made with t his little instrument. It is a strip of iron 1 inch wide and 1/8 inch thick. One end is cut narrow and is bent into a hook large enough to Page 4 of 7 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 1 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices1.html"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"fit neatly the largest wire to be spliced. At the s ides of this two notches are filed, as shown at the left. At the right the splicer is seen in po sition on the wire. The splicer should be turned backward, as it appears in the right-hand dr awing, to make the splice. A pair of large pincers or a vise should be used to hold the two wi res between the coils while turning the splicer. The splice as finished appears above. The length of the handle may vary. If the splicer is to be used for net wire, of course the h andle cannot be longer than the width of the mesh. Otherwise, 6 or 7 inches is about right for N o. 8 wire. If it is to be used only for small wire, the length of the handle should be reduced fo r the sake of convenience. Serviceable Homemade Level A serviceable level is shown in the illustration. T ake two 1-inch boards of rather hard wood, well-seasoned, 2 to 3 feet long, bolt or screw them together at right angles. This union must be so strong as never to be moved by ordinary press ure. At the top of the perpendicular piece cut a slit and insert a piece of strong threa d. To the bottom of the thread tie a thin circular weight. Lay the device across two trestles of nearly the same level. Just above the weight mark the place where the string hangs. Rever se the position of the instrument by turning it end for end, and again mark the position of the string. Half way between the two marks place a third. When the string hangs over thi s mark the lower board will be level. A shield of tin may be placed over the weight. A nail on each side of the string, just above the weight, will keep it from swinging far out of place . It must be allowed to swing freely. A simple level may be improvised by filling a small f lat bottle with water, so that only a bubble of air remains, and attaching it lengthwise and near the middle of a straight stick or narrow board. To Make a Handle Stay On To secure the handle of a hammer or ax is often qui te a bothersome problem. A special wedge made with a piece of wood as at a, in the sketch, held in place by a fence staple, b, has been devised to meet the need for a wedge that really holds. The prongs of the staple should be bent slightly outward before it is driven in, so that they will spread in the handle. There is little danger of handles coming loose when they are attached in this manner, and it is little more difficult to set a handle as indicat ed than in the old-fashioned way. A Tool Box Requisite Page 5 of 7 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 1 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices1.html"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Among the handiest things to have in the tool box a re some small bolts about 2 inches long with thumb nuts. A dozen or so of these will prove their value many times over in the course of a year. In making tables for fairs or sup pers or in any sort of knock-down arrangement, or temporary convenience where strengt h is essential, nothing surpasses a bolt of this description. With a brace and a bit the rig ht size, one may be entirely independent of nails and screws. A farmer friend of ours was once called upon to mak e a fence about a child's crib without any marring nails. A slot in the fence post with a thumb bolt just above the crib line gave an alligator jaw result which was very satisfactory. O n another occasion a knock-down stage was carried from the storeroom in pieces and put to gether by two men in 20 minutes. An actual computation of its strength showed that a lo comotive might safely run over it. The man referred to above has 100 feet of tables fo r hall purposes, depending entirely upon the 2-inch bolt and thumb nut for their fastenings and braces. There is never any trouble about knocking out nails. To one having a brace and bit these handy things will suggest of themselves many satisfactory uses. A supply of iron washers should be kept in hand, and in time a collection of various sizes of wooden washer s will accumulate. Soldering Soldering may be done by anyone having a very simpl e outfit. All that is required is a copper soldering iron, some solder, a vial of muria tic acid and some resin. A fairly successful job of soldering a tin dish may be done by scraping the surface bright where the hole is, sprinkling on a little finely powdered res in, laying on a bit of solder and holding the dish over a flame, which may be from an alcohol lam p, until the solder melts. It will cover the hole and stick. If the dish is rusty or badly t arnished use muriatic acid in place of resin. Resin works best when tin is bright, but usually so lder sticks most successfully when the acid is used. For soldering large breaks or doing important jobs of soldering the iron must be used. In order to work well the iron has to be kept coated w ith solder. When it gets blackened it should be filed until bright and then rubbed upon a smooth board while hot in a mixture of melted solder and resin. When the hot iron is taken from the fire wipe it on a damp cloth before trying to use it to lift the melted solder. A soldering iron is best heated in charcoal or the coals of a wood fire. The copper should never g et red hot, as that causes the coating of the point to be burned off. The metal to be soldere d must always be heated before the solder will unite it. Solder may be obtained in bars at any tin shop. It can be made by melting together 2 parts of lead and 1 of bar tin. This is the usual proport ion for most purposes. Soft solder that will melt quickly and can be easily used for mending tin ware can be made of pure lead and tin in equal parts. A hard solder is made by melting toget her 2 parts of copper to 1 of tin. Brazing solder is made by melting together brass and one-si xth its weight of zinc. When cool it should be granulated by pounding with a hammer. For soldering steel and iron to brass the following combination of metal is melted together, 3 parts tin, 39-l/2 copper, and 7-l/2 zinc. Before it is applied, all the metals to be jointed together must be heated to the same temperature as the soldering alloy. Gold solder is made of 24 parts gold, 2 parts silver and 1 part copper. A hard silver solder is made of 4 part s silver to 1 of copper. A soft silver solder is made of 2 parts silver to 1 of brass. 1. Workshop and Tools 2. The Steel Square 3. In and Around the House 3.

Hamilton Elliot A steel square, often called a carpenter's square, can be found in almost any kit of mechanic's tools and a little knowledge of this ins trument will aid the user to perform many problems easily and quickly that otherwise might pr ove difficult. Squares of different kinds Small farms Page 1 of 11 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 2 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices2.html"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"and materials have been used by mechanics in all ag es. The first were made of wood and were used in the construction of the earliest build ings of which we have historic record. The squares of today are made of steel, finely polished and stamped with many figures, tables and rules, according to the taste of the manufactur er and the special mechanic for whom they are designed. We will not attempt to deal with the several specia l kinds or makes, taking up only a few of the possibilities of the standard 2-foot square. Th is is 2 feet long on the blade, which is two inches wide, and it is 16 or 18 inches on the tongu e or angular leg. The latter is 1-1/2 inches wide. Beginning at the heel or corner of the square , inches and fractions of inches are marked. It is necessary that the marking be in this way, in order to form the different combinations desired in connection with the differe nt problems which have to be solved. A few of these problems are explained in the followin g pages. Lumber Rule On the side of the blade of the square that is divi ded into inches and eighths is placed the lumber rule or scale. This is used for computing th e number of feet in board measure contained in a given board or piece of lumber. We s how a picture of a section cut from the center of the lumber rule. The space running length wise of the blade between the parallel lines contains the number of feet board measure for a given width of board. The first space is for boards 8 inches wide, the second for those 9 inches wide, the third for those 10 inches wide and so on. To determine the space which should be used for any given width, look under the 12-inch mark on the outside edge of the b lade. These numbers give the width of the board, also the number of feet board measure. I f a board is 10 inches wide and 12 feet long, it contains 10 feet board measure. Now let it be required to find the number of feet b oard measure in a board 13 inches wide and 11 feet long. Find the space for boards 13 inch es wide under the 12-inch mark on the square, follow this space to the left and under the 11-inch mark on the square will be found the answer desired: 11--11. This is read 11 feet an d 11/12, and is the number of feet board measure contained in a board 13 inches wide and 11 feet long. With a little practice, anyone can measure lumber or timber and check up his bills for this kind of material. Do not confound foot board measure with square feet . Square feet are in surface measure, with no reference to thickness, while a foot board measure is the equivalent of a foot square and 1 inch in thickness. The square feet of a 3-inc h plank would contain 3 feet board measure. After becoming familiar with the use of the lumber rule, as described above, you will discover that the space may be taken to contain the amounts for a given width and the different lengths in feet as represented in the dif ferent columns, or the space may be taken as containing the amounts for a given length and th e different widths arranged in columns; therefore, find either length in feet or width in i nches under the 12 - inch mark and follow Page 2 of 11 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 2 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices2.html"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"this space until under the inch mark representing t he other measurement. In this space will be found the feet board measure. The Brace Rule The brace rule is on the tongue of the square, and has a series of figures representing the rise or vertical height, the run or horizontal reac h and the true length of a brace. For example, they are written: 27/27 38 19 and 45/45 63 64 . These would be read 27 inches run, 27 inches rise a nd a length of 38 and 19/100 inches, and 45 inches run, 45 inches rise and a length of 63 an d 64/100 inches. A glance at the illustration will give a good idea of the application of the brace rule as it appears on almost any modern make of square. The Octagon Scale Page 3 of 11 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 2 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices2.html"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" There is an octagon scale on one side of the tongue of the square, but we will not attempt to explain its use, as there are easier and simpler me thods of obtaining the same result. One method is shown in Figure 1. To obtain the line s on a square stick where the corners should come when converted into an octagon or eight -sided stick: Lay the square on the one side of the square stick at such an angle that the end of the square will come exactly at the edges or corners of the stick, make a dot on the 7- inch mark and at the 17-inch mark. Through these dots gauge or mark a line parallel wi th the edge of the stick. Continue this operation on all of the four sides. This gives the lines for the corners of an octagon. In making a flagpole or spar for a boat or to round an y large stick this is the operation used by all mechanics doing the work by hand. The Miter Box Of all homemade devices, one of the most frequently used in the shop is the miter box. After the box is put together it is a simple proble m, with the use of a steel square, to make the cuts necessary to intersect two pieces of wood, as shown in Figure 2. First, the box must be straight and true and the sides form a perfect r ight angle or square with the bottom. Lay the steel square on the top of the box so that the 12-inch mark on the blade and the 12-inch mark on the tongue will both come exactly on the ed ge of the box.

Cuts in the box to miter around an eight-sided figu re or an octagon, as shown in 5A, can be obtained by using 7 inches and 17 inches, marking t he cut on the 7-inch side, as shown in Figure 5. Truing the Square After obtaining a steel square, the first and most essential thing is to test or prove it to see that it is accurate, forming the angle of a perfect square. Take a board planed on one side and straighten one edge of it perfectly as described under \"Making a Straight Edge\" (below). Make a mark acros s this board with the square, as shown in Figure 6, Position A, then reverse the squ are to Position B. If the square is true it should exactly fit the mark made. It is necessary t o work very accurately, making the mark with the point of a knife and having the edge of th e board absolutely straight. Page 5 of 11 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 2 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices2.html"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" If the square is found to be out or inaccurate, it is not necessary to throw it away; it can be made true by a simple method by any handy mechanic. If you do not possess an anvil, make a substitute by sticking the ax into a chopping blo ck, lay the square on the head of the ax so that the bearing will come from the throat or insid e angle to the heel or outside of the square. To close up the angle, strike with a hammer a sharp blow at a point near the heel; to open the angle, strike near the throat at a point i ndicated in Figure 7. Don't strike too hard. Use a bell-face nail hammer and the dent will not b e noticed. Making a Straight Edge In connection with the work with the steel square a straight-edged board is necessary to have ready for immediate use. Procure a board 8 or 10 feet long of good, dry pine, free from knots and 6 to 8 inches wide. Plane the edge until it seems straight to the eye, then lay it on the bench or on another board and make a mark along the edge, just straight with a fine lead pencil; reverse it or turn it over and fit it to th e other side of the pencil line. This multiplies any inaccuracy or deviation from a straight line. M ake a new line each time you plane the edge. Work with as long a plane as you have and set the blade to take a fine shaving. When the edge will fit both sides of the line made from it while in one position, it is straight. Figure 8 will give a clear idea of this operation. Rafters Page 6 of 11 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 2 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices2.html"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" The common rafter for a pitch roof is easily laid o ut with the steel square. There are many methods, but the easiest and most simple is by spac ing. Two dimensions, half the width of the building and the height of the roof, are divide d into an equal number of parts. The width of half the building is called the run and is usual ly divided into parts of 12 inches or a foot for convenience. The height is called the rise, and is divided into an equal number of parts. A glance at Figure 9 tells us that the run there sh own is 10 inches rise to 12 inches run. When the square is laid on the stick to be cut into a rafter, the 10-inch mark on the tongue and the 12-inch mark on the blade are held so that they come exactly even with the outside edge. The blade then takes a level position and the tongue a vertical position or plumb position. This gives the proper level for the cut a t the top of the rafter and the level cut at the top of the plate. As the square now lies on the sti ck make a fine mark and move the square along, marking another space. Mark as many of these spaces as the parts into which the rise and run were divided. This gives the length of a ra fter from the ridge to a point exactly over the outside of the plate. Where the rafter overhangs the plate, it is necessa ry to square down or in to form the notch for the plate. By studying Figure 9 you can readily see the different positions taken by the square, also, how and why the rise and run are divi ded into an equal number of spaces. By this method the length of the rafter is obtained wi thout use of mathematics. Stair Stringer Page 7 of 11 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 2 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices2.html"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" The stair stringer is laid out in much the same man ner as the common rafter. The total rise of height to go up is divided into parts of about 7 -1/2 inches, as near as possible. This makes the easiest step. The run is always divided i nto one less space than the rise. The reason for this can be easily understood by examini ng Figure 10. Lay the square on the stick to be used as a stair stringer, taking the numbers into which the rise and run have been divided, mark, and slide the square along until the required number of spaces are marked. A little experience, with allowance made for the surr ounding conditions, and any handy mechanic can lay out stringers for an ordinary flig ht of stairs. To get an easy flight of stairs for the person of average size where plenty of room can be used, experience teaches that 7- 1/2 inches rise and 10 inches run or tread makes an easy flight. From this some stairbuilding experts have put toget her the following rule, which works very well for the average stair: When the rise multiplie d by the tread equals 75, the run will be an easy one, as 7-1/2 inches rise by 10-1/2 inches tread equals 75; 8-1/3 inches rise by 9 inch es tread equals 75; 8 inches rise by 9-1/2 inches trea d equals 76, which is very near the desired result. When the rise is 9 inches or over, the rule is not good, as the tread must be shortened up much more, and the rise should never be more tha n 11 inches -- that is about the rise in an ordinary ladder leaning against a house. The 47th Problem of Euclid The problem shown in Figure 11 is known as the 47th Problem of Euclid, and is an invention by an ancient Greek geometer who sought m any years for a method of finding the length of the hypothenuse of a right angle triangle in mathematics, and when the method Page 8 of 11 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 2 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices2.html"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"was discovered, history tells us there was great re joicing. Pythagoras is credited with having first proved the rule successfully applied to the p roblem. The rule is that the square of the base added to th e square of the altitude equals the square of the hypothenuse. The base of a right angle triangle is the side on which it rests, marked B in Figure 11. The altitude is the height and is marked A in Figure 11. The hypothenuse is the connecting side of the triangle, marked H in Figure 11. The base, 6, squared or multiplied by itself, equals 36. The altitude, 8, squared, equ als 64. By adding these together we have 100, which is the square of the hypothenuse. It rem ains but to extract the square root of 100, which we know is 10, therefore 10 is the length of the hypothenuse or third side of this right angle triangle. All right angle triangles can be fi gured in the same manner, but only multiples of the length of the three sides come eve n -- such as 3, 4, 5 and 12, 16, 20, as shown in Figure 12; and many others, of course. The Rule of 6, 8 and 10 This is a rule so extensively used in the building trades and others that it has finally come to be known by the above name. It is derived from the 47th Problem of Euclid, and is used in the manner shown in Figure 13. Measure 6 feet on the end sill of a building and 8 feet on the side sill. If it measures 10 feet across the angle the building is square. This is a very useful rule and easily remembered. It is always available in running lines for batter boa rds for masonry or lines for walks. By starting from a corner stake into which a nail is d riven, measure off on the string or line used and insert a stake to mark the place. Drive a nail into this stake and proceed in like manner on the other side. With a little care and pr actice, quite a job of surveying can be done by using a few stakes, a ball of string and a tape or 10-foot pole.

Plotting Angles To strike an angle in a field on a large scale wher e one line is given or can be obtained, measure off from the point of the angle 57-3/10 fee t; lay one end of a 10-foot pole at this point. The other end should be swung around so that it also will be 57-3/10 feet from the starting point.

A handy size for an ordinary family is 2 feet square with four shelv es, counting the top, 1 foot apart. These shelves may be hung from the co rners, the center or the middle of the sides, by means of manila sash cord over pulleys placed close to the ceiling of the kitchen and near ly balanced with weights, which should be confined in a little case. They should be guided in ascending and descending by means of groo ves in the middle of the sides extending from top to bottom of the inclosed case. In the cellar the case may have a fine wire screen door and in the kitchen an ordinary cupboard door or one with a gla ss front, as desired. The doors should slide upward and be balanced like an ordinary window with sash weights and pulleys. In order to prevent the waiter from de scending when being overloaded a pivoted wooden latch, as shown on the right-hand si de, should engage with the ends of the shelves, and to prevent any shock from too quick de scent some coiled springs should be placed at the bottom of the case. If desired a smal l cupboard may be built at the top of the case for storing little-used articles. Some advantages of such a waiter are that food may be placed on the shelves and lowered into the cool cellar and either allowed to stay the re or removed to the refrigerator. Thus it will be unnecessary to carry anything to or from th e cellar, and this will often mean a saving of several trips up and down. If the cellar is clea n and cool there may be no need to use a refrigerator or an ice box.

Transforming a Washstand The kitchen cabinet here shown was made from an ant iquated washstand and table, using old lumber, odds and ends of varnish, nails and scr ews, the finished article costing less than 50 cents. The only tools used were a saw, hammer, p lane and square, such as can be found in any farmer's collection.

To the right end was screwed a board of the same width, the shelf being so placed that it would be 2 feet above the table. A board of equal width formed the support at the othe r end. Then the wash-stand, from which the top had been re moved, was placed upside down on the shelf (bbb), one end of the washstand reaching to the extreme le ft end of the shelf, and the two were securely fastened together. This left a na rrow open space between the right end of the washstand and the right support of the shelf. A board was then nailed on top from one end to the other, and a back added. The drawer of the washstand had to be fixed so that it would slide the other way, as it was now upside down. That necessitated a shelf inside t he wash-stand above the drawer. Old lumber was used, and this was smoothed with a plane , then sandpapered and holes and cracks filled with putty. When the putty was dry it was sandpapered again. A support was then nailed to the back of the recess for a spice cabinet. This left the cabinet about 4 inches from the table. This support also di d for two shelves, one in each corner of the recess. The spice cabinet contained eight small drawers and added much to the whole. A door with a glass sash (e) was then made for the na rrow space to the right of the washstand above the recess. This made a little china closet w ith two shelves and containing over a dozen brass cup hooks. The space near the top on th e left-hand side, between the short legs of the washstand, was left open for the crumb and d raining trays. A piece of batten was nailed around the top as a finishing touch. A leaf, which could be raised when required, added to the table room. The cabinet being placed in a corner left the front and one end free. On this end or side were placed two salt boxes, one for salt, and the other for kitchen clot hs. Directly above these and reaching the length of the end was a shelf (f) for the clock, et c. Finally, walnut varnish stain, two coats, was applied. In each side of the recess were screwe d two large cup hooks. Similar hooks were screwed on the inside of the washstand doors, to hang up biscuit cutter, corkscrew, nutmeg grater, etc. Homemade Dresser Sometimes it is necessary to use homemade makeshift s in the house furnishing, and Page 3 of 12 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 3a 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices3a.html"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"sometimes it is done through a desire to exercise o ne's ingenuity in fashioning simple affairs.

To Let in More Light Many farm kitchens and dining rooms are dark and gl oomy. It is not an easy matter to cut new windows in the outside wall, though this can of ten be done to great advantage; but Page 4 of 12 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 3a 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices3a.html"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"where there is an outside door in a dark room, cond itions can very easily be improved, and that, too, at small expense. Doors vary greatly in the manner of construction, some having wide panels at the top and some having two narrow o nes of varying lengths. But almost every panel door that was ever constructed can be t reated in the way which we will describe. The two upper panels can be removed, and their place filled with two lights of glass. If the door is of modern make it will be fou nd that the wooden panel is held in place by a narrow molding all about it, both inside and o ut. Remove the molding on one side, and take out the panel. Put in the glass and replace th e molding, and the work is done. If, however, the door is of older manufacture the moldi ng on either side may be found to be a part of the door frame. In this case, cut the moldi ng away on one side, neatly and evenly, and remove the panel. Then insert the glass, and ha ving made, or bought, a little strip of molding, fasten it neatly in place around the glass with brads. In the case of some doors the two panels could be r emoved, and also the upright between them, leaving a large rectangular opening, into whi ch a single sash of four, or nine, lights could be inserted, the joints being made tight abou t it with putty and white lead. Then tack a narrow bit of molding about the sash, both inside a nd out, and a door that will give light to the room will be the result.

To Protect Baby from Hot Stove Winter months mean extra care for the mother of a b aby, but possibly the greatest of the additional cares that winter brings in this regard is that of keeping the curious tot from the hot stove. Build a pen around the stove to protect him from it. The pen is a simple affair. It consists of four little gates, made just large enou gh to surround the stove, and covered with netting. The wire netting does not interfere with t he free passage of heat and is very effective in keeping baby from getting burned. The gates are made of 1-1/4-inch strips, mortised or neatly fitted. For netting use ordinary poultry wire of 2-foot width. The gates are held in place by hooks and screw eyes. This arr angement is better than hinges, as it makes the taking down of the affair, for sweeping o r cleaning the stove, much easier. In the summer you may use the gate at the foot of t he stairs, across the porch door, and in other places where baby is determined to go, and wh ere he is in danger of falling and getting hurt unless protected in this way. For this pen, the lumber costs 25 cents, the netting 25 cents, and the hook and screw eyes 15 cents, mak ing a total of only 65 cents. A Box for Clothes In many of the furniture stores one may see pretty cloth-covered boxes that are used in bedrooms as a receptacle for various articles of ap parel, the inside, as well as the outside, being covered with pretty figured cloth. The inside of the cover is fitted with pockets for slippers and slumber shoes. These little chests are so light that they may be lifted about with one hand. To make such a chest, select one of the very light and well-made grocery boxes in which cereals and various brands of breakfast foods are s hipped, which may be had at any grocery store. See that the corners and the bottom are nail ed securely. The top will be composed of at least two pieces of board, and these can be made into a solid cover by nailing two cleats beneath them. But these will not look very attracti ve when the covering is being put on, so a more workmanlike plan will be to saw off a couple o f inches from each end of the top boards and supply the place of the wood removed by nailing along the ends a 2-inch strip of the same thickness. This gives a cleat at each end, but the cleats in this way form part of the cover itself. Use long wire nails to secure these end pieces in p lace.

Use very small tacks and carry the outside covering up over the top and down over the inside, which will make the use of tacks along the top unnecessary.

Scoops from Tin Cans Scoops for handling sugar and flour are among the m ost convenient utensils that one can have about the pantry; and in a short time a good s upply may be made from materials that are going to waste about almost every home. Take an ordinary tin can and either melt or cut off the top. With a pair of tinner's shears (a strong pair of household shears may be used), begin at the open end and split the side of the can to within about an inch of the bottom. Opposite this one make a similar slit. Parallel to the bottom of the can, cut from the lower end of on e slit to that of the other. Round the corners of the remaining half, and the body of your scoop is finished. For a handle, about 4 inches off the end of an old broomstick is just the thing. If this is not available, a handle may easily be shaped with a kni fe from a piece of soft wood. To attach the handle, from the inside drive a small nail thro ugh the center of the bottom of the can and into the center of the handle. Some additional strength is obtained by planning so that the seam of the can will run down the middle of the lip of the scoop, thus stiffening it. A salmon or corn can makes a very convenient sized scoop for the sugar, while tomato cans serve very nicely for flour and meals, and half-gallon paint buckets may be thus ut ilized for handling light materials. A Homemade Folding Table A handy game or sewing table may be made as follows : Take two planed boards 12 inches wide and 3 feet long. Fasten them together with two strips 2 inches wide and 24 inches long. Fasten these strips by strong screws in uprig ht position. Now take two similar strips and fasten them by hinges to the pieces screwed on the boards. Fasten four stout legs to these in the manner shown in the cut. Take two thre e-cornered boards large enough to hold the legs stiff when dropped into position, and fast en them by hinges, as shown.

Home Cheesemaking Nearly every farm home contains, or may easily be s upplied with, the necessary appliances to make cheese, and it is not a difficult task when one is once familiar with the process. For a small batch of about 12 gallons of milk the follo wing method is a good one: Take about 6 gallons of the evening's milk and leave it covered with a cloth in a temperature of 65 to 70 degrees until morning and then mix 6 gallons of mor ning's milk with it in a large tub or boiler. All milk may then be heated together to 80 to 90 degrees. Care must be used not to get it too hot or to expose it to a draft so that i t will cool quickly. Another good method preferred by some is to use 11 gallons of perfectly sweet morning's milk and to this add 1 gallon of milk that has sour ed and thickened. The sour milk should be stirred well to get out all the lumps and left for about 15 minutes before the rennet is put in. The easiest way to heat the milk is to place it in a wash boiler right on the stove until it gets up to 86 to 90 degrees and then raise it from the s tove by placing it on two bricks. The stove must not be too hot. Rennet in the form of tablets is most convenient an d useful for home cheesemaking. Dissolve one tablet in half a glass of cold water a nd add to the milk after it has been heated and stir well for two minutes. Some cheesemakers us e two or three tablets, as it saves time, but for beginners two are usually enough. If you ha ve liquid rennet extract, use about two tablespoonfuls. Cutting the Curd The rennet will curdle the milk and the curd will b e ready to cut in 20 to 40 minutes. This can be determined by noting if the curd breaks clea n like jelly when raised on a knife blade. The cutting can be done with a wire toaster, a long knife or a heavy wire. Cut lengthwise of the vessel and then crosswise until the curd is in nearly uniform pieces of 1/2-inch squares. After cutting, leave the curd on for five minutes, then heat slowly to 100 degrees, stirring all Page 8 of 12 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 3a 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices3a.html"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"the time. Cook for about 40 minutes at as near 90 d egrees as possible, stirring occasionally to prevent the curd from sticking together. Keep th e heat up and do not allow the mass to cool. To determine when the curd is ready, take a handful and squeeze it in the hand firmly and if it feels elastic and does not stick together, it ha s been cooked long enough. If the milk is good, the curd should have a pleasant, slightly aci d odor. As soon as the curd is cooked, draw off the whey or dip off the curd with a sieve and place in another vessel. After the curd is well drained and before it sticks together, add 1/4 pound of fine salt and mix well. After salting, let it cool for 15 minutes, stirring occas ionally, when it is ready for the hoop. Pressing and Curing For a cheese hoop, one can use a tin hoop 7 inches in diameter and 12 inches deep or an old peck measure without a bottom if holes are punched in the sides for drainage. For a press a device shown in the sketch will serve well, the pai l at the end of the lever being filled with stones. Before the curd is placed in the hoop, line it with cheesecloth, one piece the size of the bottom and another around the side. Turn the up per edge of the cloth over the edge of the hoop and fasten it tight. When the curd is pack ed firmly, put a piece of cloth on the upper end and fold it over tight. Make the pressure slight at first, but after an hour rearrange the cloth and make the pressure heavier. The pressi ng should be finished by the next day. Do not press in too cool a place, but keep the temp erature about 50 degrees. For curing, set the cheese in a damp room or cellar which has an even temperature. Turn it around daily, and if it shows signs of molding, rub occasionally with butter. It should be ready to eat in three or four weeks. Cheese will cu re at 40 degrees, but it takes longer than when warmer. Twelve gallons of milk should make abo ut 10 pounds of cheese, according to richness of milk. After one or two attempts any housekeeper should be able to make good cheese by this method. It is necessary to keep all utensils very c lean and the liberal use of boiling water with a little soda will accomplish this purpose.

Perhaps s ome of our bright boys will try this to help mother. A friend of ours had an old bicycle un fit for use. He made a frame to raise the hind wheel from the floor, wound the rim with twine (tire being off) and reversed the seat. In place of the form he inserted a piece of pipe (a stick would do as well). Then he took some old belting, cut it to 1-3/4 inches wide and a bout 10 feet long, and with that he runs the washing machine for his wife. He can read the p aper while he washes, and he does not lose much time from field work either. An emery whe el can also be run with it by bolting 1- inch strips to the top part of the frame extending over the wheel and mounting a polishing head on same. Knowledge is power. -- Bacon. Tread Power in the Dairy While the small gasoline engines adapted to running cream separators have been hailed with delight by many dairymen, the old tread power is st ill a very economical and reliable source of power. With a heavy sheep, dog or the dairy herd bull enough power can be produced to run the separator and churn at practically no cost except for the tread. One difficulty has been to secure a uniform rate of speed, but this is solved if a heavy flywheel is attached to the tread. While the sketch shows a direct drive from tread to separator, a more desirable arrangement is to have the tread located in a. room adjoining the separator room, where the milk will not be exposed to the breath of the animal. A great many men wear themselves out devising schem es to sidestep honest work. A Lamp for Cooking A lamp may be utilized for cooking purposes in the following way: Make a tripod by taking three strips of wood of equ al length, putting in one end a headless nail and making sligh tly slanting holes in the corners of a 6-inch triangular piece o f board in which to fit them. A screw hook in the center of the board, on the under side, completes the device, which has only to be stood ov er a lighted lamp to be ready for work. A small stew kettle, or tin pail, hung on the hook, within a half inch of the lamp chimney, e nables one to have a \" pot boiling\" in short order. If you have a large lamp, with a round wick, it will give the heat of two or three c ommon ones, and you can cook almost as rapidly as over a stove. With an ordinary lamp, food can be heated, eggs boi led, or coffee Page 10 of 12 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 3a 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices3a.html"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"made very quickly, helping wonderfully in the getti ng of a meal. This is also an easy and convenient way to heat bab y's milk, or water, in the night, in case of sickness. Stood on a chair by the table, the dev ice can be used to keep the coffee or chocolate hot during meal time. A round piece of sh eet iron, with chains attached to suspend it from the hook, is an additional help, to hold a steeper for tea. As this tripod can be taken apart readily, when not in use, it will be found a good adjunct to a camping outfit, even though you carry a camp stov e, for there will be times when nothing will be wanted but a hot drink, which can be made o ver the lamp with less trouble than it would be to make a fire in the stove. Hot Water All Night One of the things that must be had quickly when med icine is needed, and still more often for a bottle baby, is hot water at night. The follo wing contrivance has been found to be worth many times the trouble to make it, for it sav es annoyance at a time when baby's worrying may mean hours of sitting up. Place the socket of a wall bracket lamp just high e nough above a table so that the top of a hand lamp chimney will be 5 or 6 inches below it. M ake an arm of round iron or small piping long enough to extend out over the lamp and to this hang a hook, on which hang a small teakettle or pail. In this enough water for t he needs of a night can be kept hot without boiling, and will be ready at an instant's notice. As a night lamp is a necessity in a house where there is a youngster, the cost of this device will be nothing, for the blaze of a small burner will provide sufficient heat. The proper hei ght for the socket on the wall can be determined by measuring the hook and the kettle to be used. The lamp chimney should not be nearer than 2 inches to the bottom of the kettle , or the water will boil and steam away. 1. Workshop and Tools 2. The Steel Square 3. In and Around the House 3.

It is very rarely that a housekeeper can cut even and han dsome slices of bread, however much she may desire to have the bread plate look attract ive. One slice will be thin, another thick, while another will be thick on one edge and thin on the other. The drawing shows a simple arrangement by which all the slices of bread can be cut of an even thickness without any slant. Cut a piece of pine board to about 9 x 13 inches. N ear one end, on either side, insert firmly two pieces of very stout wire, bent double, as sugg ested in the cut. These wire supports should be at least 7 inches high, and should have a nother inch of length firmly inserted in the wood. The wire should be as stout as No. 12, or larger still, and should stand exactly at right angles to the board. Put them far enough apar t so the largest loaf will readily go between them, and have the opening in each wire sta ndard just wide enough so the knife will slide up and down without \"wobbling.\" The dott ed lines show the position of the knife when in place. Screw a little strip of wood in fron t of the wire, just far enough ahead to make the slice of bread the right thickness. Press the loaf up against this guide and cut off a slice, then press the shortened loaf up again, and repeat the process.

Pla ce the jar inside the barrel and surround it with charcoal, sawdust, or chaff, if nothing else i s available. With a tight lid and a wet cloth spread over the top, water will keep ice cold in th is arrangement. The uses of such a cooler may be multiplied to include keeping many things co ol in the house. Keep Food Cool in Summer A very convenient and serviceable place to keep dai ry products may be formed by sinking a large barrel in the ground. A shady spot should be chosen, or the heat of the sun will affect the temperature. Fill in around the barrel with sma ll stones, gravel and sand, dampened in order to maintain coolness. Construct a box around and above the top of the bar rel, and bank up with solid earth, preferably clay. This drains off the water when it rains. It also makes the bottom of the barrel farther down from the top of the opening, wh ich further promotes coolness. Next shape a light, inner lid to place on top of the bar rel, and then make a strong, hinged lid for the box, and arrange it so it may be fastened down tightly.

By being careful several vessels may be arranged one above the other in this handy little receptacle. Air out occasionally to pr event mold and odors from collecting. A Cooler Dummy Where a deep, cool well is located near the house a n arrangement may be devised that will serve the purpose of a refrigerator. Construct a fr ame of strong boards with a groove in which a board on the side of the box of shelves can run. Attach a rope to the top of the box of shelves, pass it over a wheel on the crank shaft and balance with a counter weight. If the frame is 16 feet long and extended down near to the surface of the water the lowest temperature may be secured. A nice looking top may be constructed for the arrangement, with a door opening into the shelves when they are drawn to the top. Most wells are almost as cool as a refrigerator, and this sort of an arra ngement serves the purpose with a great deal less expense. A wire clothesline will serve as a cable. Any old p ieces of iron will do for the counter weight, and it is well to have a ratchet wheel, suc h as are found on old chain pumps, to prevent the elevator dropping when it is well fille d. Make as many parts as possible of wood to prevent rusting. One such elevator is 42 inches high and 18 inches square. Turning the grindstone is hard work; but if you use it as a muscle developer it will help out. An Outdoor Closet When the housewife has baked a pie or a pudding for dinner and wishes to cool it quickly in winter it has to be set out of doors; but there the trouble begins. It cannot be set upon the snow, since that would melt and engulf the hot dish . Moreover, the cat or dog, or some neighbor's cat or dog, is likely to be lurking abou t the door, ready for pie. Let the handy man make a little out-of-door cupboard for the use of the housekeeper, locating it beside the kitchen door. Get an empty grocery box of the right size and hinge the cover to the top, placing a knob on the other edge. Make a support fo r this closet by driving two strips of wood into the ground and screwing two crosswise str ips of board to the tops. Lay the grocery box on its side on these supports and nail it to them from the inside. Here anything hot can be placed to cool quickly, an d with the cover down there will be no danger from cats or dogs or hens. If desired to giv e a freer access to the cold air, several holes can be bored in each end and in the bottom be fore putting the box in position on the supports. If the ground is frozen too hard to inser t the strips of board, the closet can be placed against the side of the house, close to the kitchen door, and supported in place by two wooden brackets. Another plan to secure the sam e result would be to make the closet and screw a wooden handle to the middle of the top, with holes bored in ends and back. When it is to be used put the dish, or dishes, insi de and set the closet out onto the snow beside the door. Taste the joy That springs from labor. -- Longfellow.

Iceless Butter and Milk Cooler The accompanying picture shows how a well may be ut ilized during the warm months for cooling butter, milk and other perishable articles. It will be found very handy as a substitute for a refrigerator when the farmer has no ice suppl y. Anyone can make a triangular-shaped frame for the windlass, which is placed above the w ell; and anyone can also put the trap doors in the platform of the well. These doors shou ld be provided with a lock, so children cannot fall in. A pin may be placed on the handle s ide of the windlass to prevent the crank from turning around when the box is lowered to the desired depth. The picture is only suggestive. The shape and size of the various parts will depend upon the style of the well. Preferably, the box should be ma de of galvanized iron and have perforations in the bottom, so it may be lowered ri ght into the water. Of course, this would not be feasible if the materials to be kept cold we re not first placed in sealed receptacles. Where a well with a bucket pump or the ordinary woo den pump is the only available place to put such a cooler, the cooler may be at one side of the well. If necessary, the position of the pump may be shifted. Knowledge is of two kinds. We know a subject oursel ves, or we know where we can find information upon it. -- Samuel Johnson.

This space is covered on the inside with a fly screen to keep out dirt and insects, and outside of this with a larger meshed screen to keep out large vermin. This gives good ventilation to the well, which never becomes foul. In the winter cover the platform with straw and snow. Cleaning a Well To remove floating litter from a well, take an ordi nary sand sieve, and, after marking off the rim into three parts, attach a wire to any of the t wo points and to this improvised handle attach a rope. Fasten the end of the rope to the th ird point in the rim and a weight to the sieve, so that it can be lowered into the well and will sink. When used, sink the sieve edgewise into the water and pull the rope with a si ngle attachment and it may be lifted out with all the floating sticks and timber on the surf ace of the water.

Filter for Cistern Water The problem of keeping water in a cistern clean is most easily solved by not allowing it to get dirty, as can be done by the device shown in th e drawing. Two barrels, each with a perforated false bottom, are set side by side benea th the water spout from the roof and connected with a pipe leading to the cistern. Above the false bottoms fine gravel and then sand are packed to the depth of 8 or more inches. O n top of the sand rest stout floats as large as can be let down into the barrels. From near the margin of the floats two heavy wires extend vertically upward about 2 feet to engage loo sely near their centers with a tilting spout by means of knobs on both the ends of the spo ut and the wires. When the barrels are empty the floats rest on the s and. As the water begins to pour in one barrel it strikes the float, but is prevented from gouging a very deep hole at the outside of the barrel by striking a strip of wood about 1 inch high, 2 inches wide and 1 foot long. This spreads the flow. A layer of gravel at this place w ould also help prevent gouging. If the flow is too great to filter away readily, the float will rise and the knob on the wire will engage with the spout, which will be tilted until the flow will suddenly start into the other barrel. If the delivery pipe to the cistern be large enough th ere should be no danger of either barrel overflowing. When the sand becomes dirty a few minu tes will serve to remove it and put in fresh. This will insure clean water in the cistern, and greatly reduce the number of times the disagreeable job of cleaning out the cistern must b e done. A Handy Water Filter Nearly every farm can boast of good water, but no w ater, either from well, spring or stream, is pure, as it all contains more or less animal or vegetable matter.

A simple water filter is very easily made that answ ers all purposes for domestic use. The plan of its operations is identical with that emplo yed in large reservoirs where water is filtered on a large scale for general distribution. This filter consists, primarily, of two flower pots, set one above the other. In the bottom of the upper pot is stuffed a large sponge. A sponge is also stuffed in the bottom of the lower p ot, but it is more adequately supplied with filtering material by placing above the sponge a la yer of smooth pebbles, then a layer of coarse sand, and still above this a layer of pounde d charcoal 3 or 4 inches in depth. It is also best to place another layer of smooth pebbles above the charcoal, to prevent it from being stirred up during the circulation of the water. The upper pot should be the largest, and if the low er one is strong, the upper one may stand in it, or two strips of wood will serve as a base s upport. The two pots thus arranged are placed on a three-legged stool with a hole in it, t hrough which the water drips through the bottom of the lower pot into the mouth of a jug set underneath. The upper pot serves as a reservoir, and its sponge stops the coarser impurit ies, and thus the filtering layers of the lower one may be used for a year without being rene wed, though it is necessary frequently to clean the sponge of the upper pot. The layers of sand and charcoal of the lower pot ar e positively effective in stopping all animal and vegetable matter, as well as many smalle r impurities in the water. The only trouble one may experience with it is in neglecting the upper sponge for too long a time, or in stuffing it in too loosely, thus allowing the wa ter to pass from the upper pot faster than it can filter through the lower one. Only a little att ention, once or twice a month, is sufficient to keep this simple filter in perfect running order . Delivering Mail by Trolley Where the house stands some distance back from the highway a trolley can be rigged up to save steps in getting the mail. The box is hung on two pulley door hangers, as shown in cut. A strong post, with a bent arm, is set next the hig hway, a, suspended between it and the house, on which the box runs. A pulley is fastened in or to, the post, and over it runs a cord, b, c, to pull the box back and forth between the house an d the road. The box is sent down to meet the carrier, who places the mail in it, and th en it is quickly pulled back to the house.

Care should be taken to have the hoops thoroughly nailed to the staves and to have the heads solid. Dark green or dark red are good colors for the painting. If preferred, the barrel may rest upon the ground, but should be securely braced or blocked to prevent rolling. Storage Bin for Vegetables Instead of keeping the vegetables in barrels or box es scattered all over the cellar, have a set of storage bins. Take six drygoods boxes and bolt t hem together as shown in the drawing. Put legs on them to hold them off the floor and a c over on the top. Then paint on the boxes the names of the vegetables. It is most convenient to have the vegetables most frequently used in the upper boxes, which would not be true of the bin shown in the picture. If the upper row of boxes is attached to each other, but n ot to the lower ones, the top section can easily be moved enough to make filling the lower bo xes a simple matter. Otherwise, the vegetables would have to be put in through the open ings at the top of each box a few at a time by hand, instead of pouring them in. Many people would not care to keep their potatoes i n such a sectional bin, preferring a large separate bin.

A very effec tive and useful temporary cellar may be constructed after the following method, as shown by the drawings: Dig a pit 15 feet long, 10 feet wide, 4 feet deep in a solid, dry place where the drainage is good. Put a gable roof of 1- inch board over the hole, supported by 2 x 4-inch s trips at the eaves, gable and half-way up the sides. Strengthen by crossbeams and a central s upport if the lumber is not first class. Over this place 8 to 10 inches of dry straw well pa cked and over the entire structure, excepting one end, pack earth 12 to 14 inches deep. The surface should be smooth to shed water. It is better if plastered with mud covered w ith sods. The door end must be double-walled and the space fi lled with straw. The door must also be double and its margin packed with cloth strips, so as to be practically airtight. If possible, the pit should be drained by a tile, the end of whi ch is covered with a piece of wire netting to prevent the entrance of rodents. Such a cellar w ill prevent freezing during usual winter weather. The door should be opened on mild days and the interior aired thoroughly. The size and depth of the pit may be varied according t o needs. Clothesline Up and Down Heavy posts should be set for the ends, 3 feet in a nd 3 feet out of the ground. It is not necessary for the center post to be as heavy as the end ones. Have the posts clean and smooth, so they will not soil the clothes when blow n against them. Take a piece of 2 x 4- inch hard wood 5 feet long for the lever. Fasten to the post near the top with a 3/4-inch bolt, 2 feet next to the line and 3 feet for the lever.

Water Supply for Farmhouse Farmers can have running water, hot or cold, in the ir dwelling houses at a cost of fifty dollars and up, depending upon the size of the hous e and the kind of equipment needed. This makes possible the bath and toilet room, prote ction from fire, the easy washing of windows and walks, the sprinkling of lawns, the irr igating of gardens, and all the other conveniences which a few years ago were thought pos sible only in cities, where big water systems were available. This is one of the things t hat makes farm life attractive. It lessens the work in the house, insures a fine lawn and gard en, reduces danger from fire, adds greatly to comfort and convenience in every directi on. The way to secure this is to install a water supply system, with a pressure tank in the basement. This pressure tank is so arranged that by pumping i t full under strong air pressure the water is forced all over the house, and is available for the bathroom, toilet room and the garden or fire hose. The water is distributed about the house exactly as it is in city homes, by means of galvanized iron pipes. Where a small building is to be supplied and the amount of water to be used is not large, the system can be installed f or $50. For the average house $90 is a better figure. Where the house is large, and where considerable amounts of water are needed for the lawn and garden, and possibly also for wash ing carriages, automobiles and horses, a larger system should be installed, costing up to $1 50. Installation and Operation Its installation is easy, and its operation is exce edingly simple. Any pipe fitter or plumber can put in the plant so that it will work perfectly . All that is needed for operating is to keep the tank pressure up to the desired point. This may be 20, 40, 60 or 100 pounds. A few strokes of the pump, if the work is done by hand, i s sufficient. If a lot of water is used, of course the amount of pumping will increase. By bein g economical in the use of water, that Page 10 of 13 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 3b 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices3b.html"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"is to say, wasting none, this matter of pumping is not at all a serious problem. The most satisfactory method of pumping, however, i s to use a windmill, or what is much better, a gasoline engine. Every up-to-date farm ou ght to have a small gasoline engine, which can be utilized not only for operating this w ater supply system, but for churning, sawing wood, cutting feed and doing a dozen and one other jobs about the farm. It would take only a few minutes of pumping to raise the pre ssure in the tank the desired height. With the engine it will not be necessary to be econ omical in using water, provided the well is a good one, and the supply of water large. Experience with Water Supply System C. A. Shamel of Illinois, editor of the Orange Judd Farmer , has a system of this kind in his country home. It cost $75. He put in a bathroom, a toilet, has a hot water tank in connection with the kitchen range, and no money ever expended on that farm has given anything like the amount of satisfaction and comfort as that paid for this water supply system. Arrangement is made to take care of the waste water and sewage by running a large tile from the bathroom, one-quarter of a mile distant, t o a large cistern, located in the center of a big field. This is disinfected about twice a year, and is easily handled. There is never any trouble with the water pipes, even during the colde st weather. Neither has there been any difficulty with the waste system. In fact, the wate r supply is practically perfect, and the people on that farm don't see how any farmer who ca n get together $75 or $100 can afford to be without it. Up to date all the pumping has been done by hand. W ith the pump in perfect condition, this is not a laborious problem. On two occasions the pu mp valve became slightly defective through wear, and it was not convenient to fix it f or a few weeks, being somewhat distant from the factory. With this condition it required a great deal more labor to do the pumping, but even with this disadvantage, it was not a serio us proposition. The illustration indicates the arrangement of a wat er supply system, and, as can be readily seen, it is very simple. Notice the hand force pump tank in the basement to hold the water under pressure, and the arrangement of lavatories, bath and kitchen hot water service. The system can also be used for supplying water to stoc k tanks, and these may be located anywhere on the farm. The pressure developed in the tank is sufficient to force the water anywhere wanted. This use will, of course, depend e ntirely upon the wishes of the owner and is simply a matter of cost of pipes. It can ver y readily be used for delivering water to dairy or other stock barns, where it can be run int o water troughs in the stalls, or elsewhere, as desired.

It is simpler to make than the rou nd basket, and has an added advantage. When not in use, the two si des press together and occupy scarcely any room. Cut out two semi- circular pieces of wood from a 3/4-inch board in th e shape suggested in the cut. Setting them at the proper di stance apart, tack a strip of canvas, or other stout cloth, around the curved partition, as shown in the accompanying picture. Nail a strap and a buckle at the sides, to go over the hea d, and the feed basket will be complete. The form of this basket more nearly fits the shape of a horse's head, and besides, because of its oblong shape, gives the horse more freedom in o pening his mouth than does the close- fitting round basket. He who will not be counseled cannot be helped Make the Horse Eat Slowly If your horse has the habit of bolting his feed you can easily remedy it by making a self- feeder on his box. The accompanying drawing shows h ow a feeder may be made similar to a poultry feed hopper.

I am only one, But I am one. I cannot do everything, But I can do something. What I can do I ought to do; And what I ought to do By the grace of God I will do. Stalls Better than Stanchions The only point in favor of stanchions is that they take up less room than stalls, but the increase in milk is a reward for allowing more spac e and convenience to each cow. The cut shows one kind of stall. The rack, a, is of hardwood 30 inches high, with the slats wide enough so the cow can thrust her nose through up to her eyes. The bottom of the rack is 18 inches wide, extending into the stall toward the cow. The feed box, b, slides through an opening in the stall on the barn floor. It can be drawn into the feedway, cleansed out and a new feed put in without being disturbed by the cow. The halter strap, c, is just long enough to allow the cow to lie down co mfortably. The gutter, d, is 8 inches lower than the stall floor. When she lies do wn she will put her head under the rack in kneeling and when she gets up, she will move backwa rd so that she can look through the rack. The length and width of stall can be made to suit the cows. Small breeds, like Jerseys and Ayrshires, will need about 6 inches less each w ay than Holsteins and Shorthorns.

Good Ties for Cows Page 2 of 21 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 4 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices4.html"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" The merits of stanchions and other forms of cow tie s have been debated by dairymen for a long time. The mass of experience is in favor of the tying arr angement which will give the cow the most freedom of movement. The old-fashioned solid s tanchion fails in this respect. In many cases it is difficult for the cow to lie down or ge t up with her head fast in one of these stanchions. The heavy swinging stanchions have advantages over this, but it also must be criticised in many cases, because of its weight and of the conseq uent lack of freedom on the part of the cow. A very light swinging stanchion is the best ty pe of that form. It is easy to fasten, as the cows will in most cases put their heads in position as they go into the stall. There is not so much danger of the dairyman being struck by the hor ns of the cow in fastening these stanchions. Many modern barns are equipped with thi s kind. The chain tie is favored in many sections. This con sists simply of a crosschain with considerable slack, attached to a ring at each end which runs over a perpendicular iron rod about 18 inches long. In the center of this chain i s a loop with a snap which goes around the cow's neck. This arrangement gives the greatest fre edom, and allows the cow to lie down and get up without difficulty. If light partitions are used between the heads of the cows no difficulty will be experienced in their striking ea ch other with their horns. This is by far the least expensive of cow ties, and is at the same tim e one of the most satisfactory. Handy Calf-feeding Device To feed a half-dozen calves at once is entirely pos sible if one uses the device shown here. A man who has one reports no more trouble with calves since he has used this. He rattles a couple of buckets together, the calves come running up to the fence and soon have all their heads through the stanchions, to which they are eas ily fastened by throwing down lever a, which draws the bar, b, into position. Then one may feed each calf without difficulty.

Make th e rack of 1-inch lumber and it can be moved from one pasture to another and attached to t he fence or a couple of posts. It can also be used for holding ewes at lambing time. Management of Kicking Cows Make a slatted stall just high enough so the cow ca n't jump out, and wide enough to hold her comfortably, with nothing to spare, and narrowe r at the end, where her feed box should be placed as high from the ground as is comfortable for her to eat out of. This slatted stall should be long enough to have cleats through which a bar or two should be run behind the cow to keep her from backing out, and also places t o run a bar in front of her hind legs about the hock joint, or as high up as possible so as not to interfere with milking. A hole about 18 or 20 inches wide is left open for this pu rpose from the ground up to the cow's flank, which allows easy and safe access to the udd er, while the cleat and post prevent the cow from kicking outwardly at the milker, thus insu ring safety. A Handy Milking Stool Milkers who have trouble with restless cows that in variably either upset the pail or get a quantity of dirt in it will find the stool shown he re a remedy for their troubles. It is also very serviceable in fly time. The upright pieces forming the legs and ends of stools are made of 2 x 8-inch pieces about 1 foot long. The supports for the bucket and the seat are made of inch boards. To secure rigidity it is well to put three- cornered blocks under the seat and bucket board as brace stays. The most restless cow is not likely to upset the bucket from this stool. The Ever Ready Stool A very convenient stool for use in milking the cow in yard or field is shown in the cut. It is Page 4 of 21 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 4 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices4.html"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"merely a one-legged stool to which are attached fou r straps connecting with a broad strap that is buckled around the waist. The stool is quic kly fastened to the milker and is always in a position so one can sit down anywhere. Such a sto ol with a short leg would also be useful in the garden. Of course, if one preferred four leg s instead of one, the stool could be so made, but experience proves that the one-legged kin d serves well. Cheap Milking Stool A cheap and very useful milking stool is made of th e reel from which barbed wire has been removed. Saw off the ends so it will set level and cut a board to fit on top. Make a hand hole through the board as shown in the illustration and the stool is ready for use. Keep Stools Clean Much milk contamination is undoubtedly due to the c areless handling of the milk stools. When the milker is through milking one cow he gives the stool a toss, then he picks it up again when he starts to milk the next cow and his h ands become more or less contaminated from the stool and from them the dirt drops into th e milk pail during the milking. When the milking is over, the stool is left in the yard or on the barn floor. It is so easy to make a small rack and to bore holes in the legs of the stool, so that they may be hung up. This keeps them out of the dirt and it is only nece ssary to brush them off carefully once in a while to keep them scrupulously clean. The man who is constantly changing his mind usually has little to change.

Use or practice of a thing is the best master. Cheap Sheds of Straw It would pay every farmer to put up in the pastures some kind of protection for his sheep, hogs and cattle. Where labor is scarce and hay and straw is plentiful and cheap, a condition which prevails in many large sections, straw sheds and barns are very profitable. Put up a framework of posts 8 feet high, 16 feet wide and as long as needed; 30 feet is a good length. The posts are hewed evenly on two sides and set so that a bale of straw will fit snugly between them. They are cut off at a uniform height and a 2 x 6 spiked securely on top. Rafters are nailed to this and covered loosely with poles. Baled straw is used for the sides. After the sides are up the roof is covered 2 feet d eep with loose straw held in place with a few poles that are tied together in pairs and place d over the ridge. Several of these sheds have been built for five years and have not needed any attention.

The one shown is mounted on old cul tivator wheels. Packing the Fleece One of the best ways to pack a fleece is to lay it upon a table, turn in the head and tail, then the flanks. After this roll it up into a neat roll and tie firmly, using such a device as here illustrated. The tying box is made from light lumber with slots, as shown, through which the rope is passed. The fleece is placed upon this rope and the roll easily tied. Wool buyers prefer to have the fleece loose, light to handle and elastic and tied up so that it can be opened if needed.

You may rig up a simple arrangement so that you can handle heavy hogs witho ut assistance. Build a fire box with a flue, b, of three joints of old stovepipe. The vat is made o f heavy galvanized iron 4 feet long by 2 feet wide and 18 inches deep. Over this erect a frame of 2 x 4-inch strips, upon which place an old traveler from a hay carrier, or constr uct one similar to d. With the windlass arrangement, a , and the tackle, e, to which are attached the four feet of the hog, you can convey it from the vat to the bench. A rope, c, passing over the pulley at g, serves to pull the carrier, d, over the bench from the vat. Heating Water for Hog Killing A device which is superior to the old iron kettle f or heating water is shown in this sketch. Take a piece of 2-inch iron pipe 8 feet long and ha ve it securely screwed into the bottom of a stout vinegar barrel. In the other end of the pip e screw a large wooden block. By arranging the affair as shown in the sketch wate r in the barrel will be heated rapidly and can be removed as desired without bothering the fir e. Do not make the mistake of putting a metal cap on the end of the pipe, or the steam may sometimes burst the piping before the cap will come off. The wooden block acts as a safet y valve and will fly out if pressure is too great. A Farm Slaughterhouse If one butchers his own stock on the farm he would do well to fix up a small building for a slaughterhouse. This can be done so easily and at s uch small expense that almost any farmer can afford one. It is generally most convenient to have it near the hog yard, for then the refuse can be easily conveyed to the hogs. Indeed i t would not be a half bad idea to have it in some instances a part of the hog house. The room in which to kill cattle and hogs should not be less than 15 feet square. This will give ple nty of space for the work. As much of the room should be kept clear from fixtures as possible .

A pipe should carry the liquid from this opening to a trough in the hog yard. The ideal way would be to make the walls of concrete for about 3 feet from the ground. This will make it much easier to keep the place clean. It is quite ne cessary that a good supply of water be close at hand. If possible, a water pipe with hose attached should be in the house. This will enable one to flood the floor at any time. The illustration shows a very good device for handl ing the carcasses. It is made of a heavy roller, c, 5 to 6 inches thick, and long enough to reach acros s the width of the room. It is supported in the middle by a bracket, d, detail of which is shown in the drawing. This makes it possible to lift a carcass of any weight. A drum, b, is attached to the roller at one end, over which is run the rope that communicates w ith the crank, a , at the floor. Any man handy with tools can make this derrick. In order to simplify matters one may use a barrel c art water heater. This barrel has a valve attached at the bottom. To this is fastened a rubbe r hose that communicates with a small coil of pipes. This coil of pipes in turn communicates w ith the top of the barrel by another rubber hose. The coil of pipes is placed over a fir e built in a hole in the ground, and the valve is opened. As soon as the water in the coils becomes hot it is forced through the rubber hose, and a circulation is started. This device will heat water very rapidly and easily. When the water is heated the rubber hose is detached and the barrel w heeled under the derrick on which the hog is hung. By means of a crank the carcass is let into the water to be scalded. With simple devices one man can very easily do the butchering a lone. It will be found convenient to have a table that folds up against the side of the building on which to cut up the meat.

A rope passes over the pulleys at d, to a weight, which allows the stairway to be held u pright while the hay is being put down. The rope, e, is handy to pull the stairs into position. Hang Up the Lantern Here is a good idea for hanging a lantern over the barn floor. Get two pulleys with screw stems, and screw one in beam overhead, the other at top of post. Have a bracket lower on the same post. Take a piece of small but strong cor d, and at one end fasten a snap and pass the other end through the pulleys. Put your lantern on the snap and draw it high enough so it will be out of reach of forking hay, and you can se e all over the barn floor. You can raise the lantern high enough to pitch hay from the top o f the mow with no danger of turning the light over and burning the building and contents.

A rack made as shown in the drawi ng will hold two or three shocks and gives a better place for the husker to sit. Place t he stalks cross-wise of the bench in front of you. A Homemade Feed Cutter Page 18 of 21 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 4 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices4.html"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" An old lawn mower can be arranged to make a fairly satisfactory straw or feed cutter. One must rig up a hopper, as shown in the sketch, and a ttach the mower to the lower end of it so that the straw or grain will just strike the knives where the grass usually comes into the mower. A crank and a belt arrangement makes it easy for one man to feed and turn the cutter. This is a good use for a lawn mower in the winter time when it is not working outdoors. Saw Root Cutter Those who have cut roots in the winter time with a butcher knife or hatchet will fully appreciate something better for a root cutter. A Wi sconsin farmer has found a serviceable homemade lever cutter very efficient for all roots. For hard ones, like rutabagas, it is about the best thing available. His is made out of an old hand saw, sharpened on the back, fastened by means of a bolt passing through a hole punched at the small end, and held by a guide formed of two pieces of wood secured upright, so as to have a slit for the saw to work in. This contrivance is a success, and with a littl e practice the roots may be cut very rapidly. See accompanying illustration. The cutter may be mo unted upon the wall wherever it will be most convenient. The bench or platform should be at about the height of a common table.

Take two 12-inch boards and nail them strongly together. With divide rs mark around a circle, then saw out and mark in quarters. Cut four slots 7 inches long on a slant, as shown by dotted lines, so the cabbage will fall through easily. Next cut two circles 4 inches in diameter. Nail one to the large wheel on the back and leave the other loo se on the shaft to act as a bearing. Make a frame to admit the wheel, leaving 2 inches clear, and just wide enough so the knives do not strike the side. Make a top over the wheel and put a hopper on the opposite side from the crank. The knives are 8 inches long and can be made from an old bucksaw and ground down sharp, with a bevel on one side. Screw these o n the wheel at a slant according to the thickness the cabbage is wanted. A square hole shou ld be cut through the center of the wheel for the shaft. Kindle not the fire that you cannot extinguish. A Substantial Driveway A plank driveway to the barn is usually made steep in order to save planks. It is continually wearing out and breaking. A substantial driveway wi th an easy grade can be made by driving down stakes close together on either side, and filling in between with stones, rubbish and earth, packing all down firmly. When fu ll to the top, pack some earth against the outside of the stakes and sod over the sides. T his driveway will form an easy rise and will prove very durable. 1. Workshop and Tools 2.

The feed is poured into this hopper and runs down i nto the box at the bottom as fast as needed. The size of the hopper can be varied to sui t the size of the flock. It should be screwed to wall of poultry house about 12 inches fr om floor. By using this hopper one may keep a dry mixture consisting of wheat bran and mid dlings and occasionally corn meal, or a small amount of linseed meal, always before the fow ls. In addition, some people feed a mixture of whole corn, oats and wheat in the litter morning and evening, also ground green bone and beef scraps. Keeping the Water Clean Few drinking fountains are more successful than a l arge bottle or jug filled with water and inverted. It can be fastened wherever convenient wi th straps.

Drinking Fountain The best drinking fountain, in that it is impossibl e for small chicks to get drowned, and they cannot stand in the water to befoul it, is made by inverting a can or pail in a pan a trifle larger. Tomato cans with the edges pounded down, le aky pails with the ears bent up, in fact anything with a smooth top and in which a hole can be made, can be used.

This sort of roost will accommodate more fowls in t he same space than the flat kind, but it should not be made very high. A Good Poultry Nest A useful trap nest can be made of grocery boxes. Th ey should be at least 12 inches each way. The illustration shows how they are made. In t he cut the trap is set ready for the hen to enter. A cleat, c, is fastened to a small piece of cord, which is tied to a nail on the side of the box. Set the trap by raising it and resting the cle at on the nail, with the other end under the arm marked a . This leaves an opening from 4 to 6 inches wide, w hich is not enough for the hen to enter. In going into the nest she will be ob liged to raise the trap door, which will let the cleat fall, thus closing the trap after the hen has gone in. The trap door, the arms and the cleats may be made out of lath. Leave a little space between the boards in the walls, so the heat can escape, ot herwise it will be too warm in summer. The bottom board, b, in front should be 3 or 4 inches wide, and the lowe r piece of the trap door should rest against this so the hen cannot get her head through, raise the trap and get out.

A Box Chicken Coop The diagram shows a convenient way to make a coop f or the poultry yard, of which the special feature is its door. Procure a box of the r ight dimensions and saw a hole, d, in one end. Then strengthen the box with narrow strips of wood, b, c, on each side of the hole b, c. This acts as a groove for the door, a , to slide in. Thus you have a sliding door, which opens and shuts with the greatest ease. The front of the coop is inclosed with lath, or narrow strips, placed 2-1/2 to 3 inches apart. The top should be c overed with a good grade of roofing paper to make it waterproof. A coop of this sort sh ould be 2 to 2-1/2 feet long, 16 inches deep and 2 feet high. A Low Poultry Run A safe and secure run that requires less material t han a high pen can be made from laths sawed in two, which would make the sides 2 feet hig h, making the frame of scantlings and the top of sawed laths, box boards or similar mater ial. The top of the run should consist almost entirely of trap doors, using bits of old ha rness for hinges, which will look well if cut neatly. The picture shows one of the doors propped up to show the construction more Page 4 of 9 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 5 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices5.html"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"plainly.

The frame material is of 2 x 2-inch scantling at the corners, while the side strips are made of inch boards sawed 2 inches wide. The earth under this run should be slightly mounded for the sake of dryness. Whatever is worth doing at all is worth doing well. -- Earl of Chesterfield. A Portable Chicken Coop One of the annoyances about an ordinary chicken coo p is that it is not easily moved from place to place, nor provided with a yard. To obtain a yard the coop must be moved separately, and thus require the loss of more or le ss time. In the drawing shown herewith is a simple, homemade coop, which can very easily be m oved by the aid of the handles at the apex at each end. The coop is built of ordinary mat erial on a base frame, and with a V- shaped roof and side frames. The ridge pole is exte nded, as shown at each end, to form a handle. A convenient length is about 2 feet for the coop and 3 or 4 feet for the yard. If desired, the hen may be allowed the freedom of the yard or may be held in by slats, as shown in the drawing. A Homemade Brooder The material costs about $2 and a handy person can build one in a day. The gas from the lamp does not go into the chick apartment at all, b ut filters around under the floor, making it dry and warm. The lamp flame is about 3 inches from the sheet iron. The heat flows up gently through the drum, f , which is perforated with holes in the side, thus letting part of the heat out into the hover and the balance in the broo der above. The heat reservoir, g, between the sheet iron, k, and the floor, c, is about 1 inch deep. The tube, f , should not touch the sheet iron, merely extending through the floor, c. It takes very little oil.

Movable Brooder House The type of house shown in the cut is one of the be st for raising poultry. It may be built on runners, with a tight board floor of matched boards . A convenient size is 6 feet wide and 10 feet long, 6 feet high in front and 4 feet at the r ear. The door is in the middle, and there is a window on each side, with two openings below. The r oof should be covered with a good quality of prepared roofing. The same material used to cover the sides will make the house warmer. Roosts may be put in after the brooders are taken out, and the chicke ns easily protected from foxes and other animals. A Very Cheap Henhouse It was built by a \"down east\" Yankee. The studs and rafters were made of two pieces of 1 x 2-inch stuff nailed together T shape. These were se t up 2 feet 10 inches apart on centers and covered with wire netting drawn taut. This was then covered with tarred paper, which made the only material between the fowls and the outside air. They have wintered in these houses without discomfort, and gave a good egg yield. The wire netting prevented the paper from sagging when the house was covered with snow. They can who think they can. A Daylight Chicken Catcher Do you, when you want fried chicken on short notice , run it down, provided it doesn't run you down ? Here is a better way. Fasten a barrel ho op securely to a handle about 6 feet long, and to it fasten a bag about 3 feet deep. A p iece of an old hammock is fine for a bag, or horse net or fish net -- anything the chicken ca nnot get out of. Lay it on the ground, call the chicken and throw the corn over the bag, and wh en one suitable goes on lift up the hoop and you have it. If the bag is made not over 1 foot deep it can be dropped down over the chicken while eating. A Simple Hawk Trap Make a box 4 inches deep, 6 inches square and nail to a 4-foot pole with cleats at the bottom to keep from turning over. Cover top of box with 1-inch mesh wire. Place a little chicken in the box; then put a steel trap on top of box and set it out under the trees where the hawks lodge to watch for the chickens. If there are hawks around, it is pretty sure to catch them.

Practical Hives and Hive Making VERY apiarist knows that there is no item in bee ke eping of more practical importance than the hive and brood frame. The Langstroth, or Simplicity size of frame has become almost standard, for there are mor e frames of this size in use than all others combined. The frame proper is 17-5/8 inches long, 9-1/8 inches deep, and the top bar is 19 inches long. There are several styles made, b ut many prefer what is known as the Hoffman. This has a heavy top bar in depth, as well as width. The ends, or end bars, are made 1-3/8 inches wide for about 3 inches down and one side is worked off to a knife edge, which comes against the square edge of the next fra me, making them self-spacing, but not a closed-end frame, and allowing the proper bee space between the top bars. This works fairly well without the use of the honey board, though one is preferable. The hive for this frame, to be best adapted to the production of comb or extracted honey, should contain 10 frames, the insi de dimensions being 15 inches wide, 10 inches deep and 18-3/8 inches lo ng. A follower can be used at one side to assist in removing frames by first removing the follower or division board. This arrangement leaves 3/8 inch between the top of the frames and the top of the brood nest , so that when the surplus cases are put on the proper bee space is pr eserved. This hive is made of scant 1/2-inch lumber for the outside, ship -lapped together in a manner to make a perfect joint. It is 20 inches wid e, 24 inches long, about 20 inches high to the eaves, or roof, outside measurements, and weighs complete about 50 pounds. The inside dimensi ons of the brood nest should be the same as any 8 or 10-frame hive, as the bee keeper may prefer. The brood nest is raised sufficiently to admit of packing bet ween it and the hive proper, also a space for packing at ends and sides. The lower portion of the hive being well protected against the cold, the warmth of the bees Page 7 of 9 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 5 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices5.html"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"will care for the upper portion. To avoid condensat ion cover the brood nest after removing the surplus cases with a porous substance, or chaff cushion. Make a wooden rim about 4 inches deep, covering the top and bottom with burla p and filling with wheat chaff or cut straw. Many prefer the cut straw both for cushions and packing the hives. This rim should be made a little smaller than the inside of the hiv e. In extremely warm weather the cover can be raised a few inches in front, giving a circulation of air all around the surplus departmen t, and shading it at the same time. The cover is hinged at the back end, and when raised, a s shown in cut, makes two shelves for the use of the operators, which are highly appreciated; besides, there is no lifting on or off of covers, as is the case in other hives. The alightin g board is hinged and can touch the ground, which is of great advantage to the bees during a he avy flow of honey. Perhaps there are more single-walled hives used in the United States than double-walled or chaff hives, but in northern states a double-walled hive is preferable. Device for Extracting Beeswax Wax, as produced by the bees and worked into comb, is almost pure white, but, on being melted and cooled, is yellow. A man who knows advis es every beekeeper to use the solar wax extractor. All that is necessary is to have a box with glass t o fit over it, as shown in the drawing. To melt combs, put in the box an old dripping-pan, hav ing a hole at one corner, and that corner the lowest, with some kind of a dish set under to c atch the wax. Set in the sun. To get the most out, break up the combs into fine pieces, then soak in water for a day or two longer before rendering. Self-feeder for Bees A very simple device for feeding bees on syrup may be made if you take an ordinary fruit can, fill it full of syrup and over the top tie a t hick rag with a string. Then invert the can in a small pan or dish. The syrup will seep out through the rag around the edges of the jar just fast enough for the bees to keep it cleaned up. 1. Workshop and Tools 2.

A Folding Trellis A good way to pole beans is to make a folding trell is out of plastering lath, as shown in the cuts. Bore three small holes through each lath, as shown in the first cut and fasten them together with common wire nails well clinched. Five-foot posts are set 1 foot in the ground and a wire strung at top and bottom. The laths are fastened to the wires with string, as shown in the second cut. The trellis is made in sections so as to be easily handled. When not in us e it is folded up and laid away under shelter. The posts are spaced evenly so that one se ction of trellis will just go between two posts. Easy Way to Pole Beans Set posts at convenient distances apart and stretch a wire at the top. This may be done as soon as ground is plowed. Plant and cultivate one r ow each side of line until beans begin to vine, then set poles slanting, tying them together where they cross at the wire.

Trellis that Stands Alone A plant support or garden trellis, such as shown in the drawing, is very handy in the garden. This double form of trellis can be folded up and ta kes very little room in storage.

They are useful for to matoes, beans, peas, cucumbers and other plants that need some support. The double trellis i s built of narrow 1/2-inch slats and pieces of 2 x 3, which are bolted together for the legs.

A large one will be wanted for a large spreading plant and a small one for a small p lant. It is important to have trellises just the right size to give proper support. Protecting Newly Set Plants Plants newly transplanted always demand more or les s protection from the blighting effects of too much sun and wind. It is best achieved by ma king a shelter such as is shown in the cut. Two 10-foot poles and two 3-foot pieces of any convenient thickness for the crosspieces, with four 14-inch weather-strips for t he legs, constitute the frame. In the middle of it two hooks should be inserted on each side, an d upon these the covering fastened which can thus be adjusted very quickly. The covering may consist of burlap or any kind of rough sacking. Being so simple and economical to make it is advisa ble to have enough frames to protect the number of tender plants that are set out in a g arden at one time. They possess other advantages than sheltering the young things from th e direct rays of the sun. They allow slow evaporation, and so keep newly watered ground moist for hours, whereas if exposed to the sun and wind it would soon become dry and caked . On windy days it is only necessary to let the sacking down on the windward side of the shelter. In case of frost the protection that they afford is of inestimable value.

Making the Hotbed The value of every vegetable garden can be greatly increased and the time during which a supply of fresh vegetables may be secured for the t able greatly lengthened by the use of the common manure hotbed and the cold frame. These indi spensable adjuncts of the good garden are so easily made and cost so little that i t is surprising they are not more common. A good hotbed made the latter part of February or i n March can be made to yield an abundant supply of lettuce, radishes, spinach, etc. , for table use by the time such crops are being planted out of doors, and the supply of cabba ge, tomatoes and other plants for the home garden can be secured ready to transplant seve ral weeks earlier than if plants grown in the open were depended upon. As a source of heat fresh horse manure is used. Abo ut half manure and half fine straw mixed together should be piled in square piles 2 or 3 feet in depth, and 4 or 5 feet in width and long enough to contain the amount necessary for the beds desired. After heating has well started, the piles should be forked over, turn ing the outside of the old pile to the inside of the new, and when heating again is well under wa y the material is ready for use. In the meantime select a well-drained spot, sloping to the south, if possible. Dig a trench 6-1/2 feet wide, 2 feet deep and as lo ng as desired, running east and west. Now place the manure in the trench, tramping and packin g in thin, even layers until level with the surface. Make a frame 6 feet wide and as long as de sired, but some multiple of three, because the hotbed sash are always made 3 feet wide . The end piece should be 9 inches high in front and 15 inches high in the back. The front side board should be 9 inches wide and for the rear it will require two boards, preferably 12 and 3, with the wide one at the top. A frame 12 or 15 feet in length will be quite large enough for the ordinary farm garden. Set this frame on top of the manure with the slope faci ng the south and secured by stakes. On top of the manure put 6 inches of good garden soil and cover the frame with common sash or windows 6 feet long by 3 feet wide. At first the heat will run very high, but in a few days it will fall to 80 or 90 degrees, when it is safe t o plant the seeds. Making Permanent Hotbeds Hotbed sash should be constructed of white pine or of cypress, and the sash bars should run in one direction only, and that lengthwise of the s ash. The bars may be braced through the middle by a transverse bar placed through the long bars below the glass. The two ends of the sash should be made of sound timber, 3 inches w ide at the top and 4 inches wide at the bottom end, mortised to receive the ends of the sas h bars, and with a tenon at the ends to Page 4 of 12 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 6 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices6.html"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"pass through the side pieces, which should be 2 1/2 inches wide. A permanent hotbed should be so constructed as to b e heated either with fermenting manure or by radiating pipes from the dwelling or greenhou se heating plant. For a permanent bed, in which manure is to supply the heat, a pit 2 to 2 -1/2 feet deep, according to the latitude in which the work is to be done, should be provided. The sides and ends may be supported by a lining of plank supported by posts 4 feet apart, or, what is better still, a brick wall 9 inches thi ck, as shown in the drawing, may be used. In either case the pit lining should come flush with t he surface of the soil. The site for the pit should be on naturally well-drained land, and a til e drain from the bottom of the excavation should be provided to prevent the water from accumu lating in the pit and stopping the fermentation of the manure during the period the ho tbed is in use. Standard hotbed sash are 3 by 6 feet. The pit, ther efore, should be some multiple of 3 feet in length, and the width should be the same as the len gth of the sash, 6 feet. The plank frame, or the brickwork of the pit, may be extended above the surface of the ground sufficiently to allow for placing the sash immediately upon these p ermanent structures. Heat for Hotbeds Make an excavation 5 x 16 feet on the surface, and about a foot deep. Lengthwise along this space lay three rows of tiling, one along the cente r and one about a foot from each side. The tiles should be 4 inches inside measure, and 1 foot long. These are placed end to end so as to fit closely, and earth is pressed around them so as to hold every piece exactly in place. Then the excavation is filled with rich soil until level with the surface, excepting at the end the tiles are left bare for a few inches. The board frame, 5 x 15 feet, is next put in place so as to leave 6 inches of each row of tiles projectin g beyond the ends of the frame. At the east ends of the bed, a hole should be dug 3 x4 feet on surface and 2 feet deep; in this hole a crude fireplace may be made of loose brick a nd the flue connected with the three ends of projecting tile. At the west end of the fra me a brick chamber should be made into which the three tiles enter, giving them a common f lue for outlet. Cover the top of this chamber closely, excepting a 6-inch circular hole, into which a single length of stovepipe is fitted. A sloping door is hung over the fireplace c avity to keep out the rain; and the earth raised high enough around to prevent surface water from running into the hole. Bank soil about the frame. You may happen to have on hand six old storm window sashes of that size. Of course the sashes slope to the south in the usua l way. When the fire is kindled in the fireplace the smoke comes freely from the stovepipe. The tiles are covered with soil to a depth of about 6 i nches. With a good fire, you can quickly warm up the earth on the coldest days of spring. An d when once well heated, the earth and tiling hold the heat for a long time, provided the draft is closed. Unlike beds heated with manure, the heat supply can thus be regulated to su it the demand of the prevailing weather. Cold Frames and Their Management In the South cold frames are in use all winter. The principal winter crops grown are lettuce, radishes, beets, cauliflower and occasionally cabba ge, while these crops are commonly followed in spring by cucumbers, cantaloups and som etimes Irish potatoes. The frames are easily made. Rough inch lumber (heart pine is best in the South, and hemlock in the North) and 2 x 4 or 2 x 3-inch scantling are all that is r equired. For the double frames, strips 3 inches wide and 3/4 or 1/2 inch thick, long enough to extend across the frame, should be provided for rafters. The back or north side of the single frame should be 12 or 15 inches high, while the front should slope down to 8 inches . In Southern practice, where canvas Page 5 of 12 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 6 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices6.html"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"covers are used, the back should be 2-1/2 feet and all cracks should be well covered with building paper, held in place by laths tacked over it. Good treatment for the posts used in construction i s to dip them in kerosene over night. This will preserve them indefinitely. Drive the posts in to the ground 18 inches and let them extend upward to the top of the boards, putting a p ost at the union of each pair of boards and nailing them to it. All ends and rafters may be made so that they can be quickly removed, so that the frames can be plowed and the g round prepared with a mule. The sides of the double frames are best made 1 foot high, wit h the ends sloping upward to 2-1/2 feet. Down the center of the frame, a row of 2 x 4-inch p osts 2-1/2 feet above ground are set 8 feet apart. Over each one of these a rafter is bent and fastene d to the sides of the frames. For cold frames in the North, glass is the only cov ering to be thought of. By all means, put the frames up facing the south or southeast and to afford protection against the north and northwest winds, cold the country over, a high wall , a thick hedge, or a piece of thick woodland should be close at the back of them. The soil in the frames should be thoroughly prepare d, rich and pulverized thoroughly. An abundance of well-rotted stable manure should be us ed; if thoroughly decomposed, at the rate of 75 to 100 tons an acre is not excessive, un less the soil is already very rich. Whether glass or canvas is used as a covering great attenti on must be given to water and ventilation. The land should be well drained that no water will stand, or the soil become water logged; that is one side of the water question, but in addi tion, the plants should be carefully watered from time to time to provide sufficient for their n eeds. If the coverings are kept down too constantly, the growth of the plants will be weak and spindling and such diseases as damping off, Botryti s and drop will work havoc with them. Careful attention to watering, ventilation and keep ing the surface of the ground stirred are the genuine secrets of controlling these pests. Wat ch the temperature, do not let it rise too high, lower it by raising the sash or drawing back the covers. The canvas covers should be drawn back a portion of every day when the temperat ure is not too low, and at other times the ends may be raised, to allow the air to circula te under them. A sharp eye must be kept on the frost item. Sometimes steam heat is provided , oil stoves may be used and glass- covered frames should be covered with burlap or str aw mats, securely held down either by tying them in place or by weighting them down. Both canvas and the glass covering should be well fastened to prevent their being lifted off by strong winds. The upper end of glass sash may be held down with a hook and staple, a hook being placed on the back of the frame at the center of each sash with the staple in the end of the sash. Canvas covers are best held down by nailing along t he center to a board run lengthwise on the center of the rafters, in the case of double co verings, or along the back in the case of single ones and by placing marbles or small pebbles in the cloth and tying about these every 4 or 5 feet, along the ends and sides, slipping the looped ends of the twine used in tying them over nails driven into the ends and sides of t he frame. A Hand Garden Cultivator Page 6 of 12 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 6 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices6.html"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":" Now that garden crops are planted almost exclusivel y in rows a tool that will clean out the weeds, stir the soil around the plants, and, by mak ing a good surface mulch, prevent the loss of moisture to some extent, is essential for the pr oper care of the garden. The wheel hoe of our cultivator is usually used for this purpose by the professional gardener, but the price is generally considered rather high by the ordinary fa rmer or amateur. This machine, although homemade and not very handso me in appearance, does the work as well as a $6 or $8 tool, and cost not more than 40 cents to make. For a wheel, take the fly wheel of an old sewing machine, about 1 foot in dia meter, and put a round bolt tightly through the axle. Then a piece of plank, a , 20 x 10 inches, and cut as shown, boring holes for the axle where marked. After the wheel is set i n place, it should turn easily and steadily, if balanced properly. For the handle, c c, cut out and round from a piece of plank two pieces, or use any that may be otherwise obtained. Then get a blacksmith to make three teeth, b , out of a piece of spring steel 1 inch wide and 8 inches long, bent as shown. Two- inch holes are drilled through them for screws. One tooth should be placed about 6 inches behind th e wheel and directly in the center, the other two being 4 inches behind the first, and the same distance from the center tooth. When this cultivator is pushed through the rows it shoul d run with little pressure from the operator, clearing out the weeds and stirring the s oil at the same time. This contrivance does the work well, and if given two coats of brown and green paint it will be improved in appearance. Know thy opportunity. -- Pittacus. A Convenient Garden Stool This device will prove useful in doing hand work in the garden. It is made from two barrel staves upon which is mounted a low stool. This shou ld be narrow, so that it may be drawn between the rows of vegetables. The holes in the se at are large enough for the fingers to go through and render the stool more easily handled. T he device is especially convenient for the women. Watering Seed Soil Made Easy To avoid disturbing small seeds by watering, when p lanted in forcing boxes, a plan has been devised which not only insures against the disturba nce of the seed, but keeps the soil of the entire box in a moderate state of moisture, which i s an essential feature in early growth.

Then get a few small unglazed flower pots and place same on stove until quite hot. With a short piece of candle, seal drain hole in bottom of pots, taking c are not to put wax over the entire bottom of pot. Place pots in box about 9 inches apart on a thin layer of sand, and overlap pieces of broken pots, to convey by capillary attraction the water to the entire soil of the box, which soil should be sifted and box filled to within 1/4 inch of the top of the pots. Cover the box with glass, and heat from above will draw the water up to the roots. By this method you will not have surface baking, which is s o troublesome with surface watering. If so desired, you can cover the pots with circular pi eces of paste-board or tin, and avoid surface evaporation from the pots. Always fill pots with warm water. Catching Owls and Hawks A friend of ours captured a large owl and fastened him securely with a small chain to a stake in the middle of an open fie ld. He set three posts 5 feet tall and 4 to 5 inches in diameter 20 to 30 ya rds from the owl, and on each post placed a small steel trap with a bunch of hay or grass tied to the post just under the trap, to hide it, as shown in c ut. At night, the owl called. Others came, and seeing nothing near, alighted in t he trap on the post. During the day hawks came, and were caught in the s ame way. In two months two owls and 17 hawks were caught. In some p laces a bounty is paid, so there is a profit in two ways. The owl may be fed on the hawks caught and on rabbits or chickens that may die arou nd the premises. The most difficult part of this scheme is often the cap ture of the first owl, but if you are a good hunter you will find a way. Make no absolute promises, for nobody will help you to perform them. Money is a good servant, but a bad master. Moving a Large Tree To move a large tree one may find it very satisfact ory to use a rig similar to that shown in Page 8 of 12 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 6 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices6.html"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"the picture. Make a three-sided standard of 2 x 4-i nch stuff. Loosen the dirt around the roots of the tree and wrap the tree firmly at the base wi th old carpet or burlap to prevent injury. Place the standard firmly in the ground and tie the cross-piece to the body of the tree with strong rope to each side of the standard and hitch a horse to the other end. With a slow pull the tree can be drawn onto the drag and then hauled to the new location. It can be placed in the ground again by using the standard in the same way it was used to load it upon the drag. A penny saved is two pence clear, A pin a day's a groat a year. -- Benjamin Franklin. The man who builds, and wants wherewith to pay, Provides a home from which to run away. -- Young. Transplanting Trees Here is a way to transplant large trees that is not so difficult as such transplanting is by many supposed to be. The first move to make is to d ig all round the tree, leaving a large ball of soil, which is carefully wrapped in sacking or c anvas to hold it on the roots and prevent drying. When this is well tied in place a chain is passed round the ball two or three times and hooked, as shown in Figure 1. Then with a pair of heavy wheels on a short axle an d a strong pole laid across it, with a massive iron hook fastened to the pole, it is easy to back up to the tree. The sketch, Figure 2, shows the truck with its lever raised ready to h ook into the chain. The rope at the end of the pole brings it down and the tree up, when the p ole is fastened under a second pair of wheels. The young trunk must be kept from contact w ith the machinery by the free use of blankets and bags. The secret of success in transpl anting trees is to injure the roots as little as possible. The manly part is to do with might and main what yo u can do. -- Emerson. Many things difficult to design prove easy to perfo rmance.

Homemade Fruit Picker This is a device that is hard to beat for reaching fruit at the top of tall trees. After a little practice, a man can operate it rapidly, far outstri pping hand pickers and at the same time not injuring the fruit. The construction is shown in th e upper drawing. The main frame is of heavy copper wire, to which is attached the strong spring, d. The end, a, is inserted into a wooden handle as long as needed. When the muslin sa ck is attached, as shown in the picture of the picker in use, the jaws of the picker are ea sily closed by pulling slightly on the cloth. The fruit falls through the sack or long cloth tube into the hand of the operator. Many devices have been made for this sort of service, bu t it will be hard to find one that works better than this one if constructed in the exact sh ape indicated. A Truss Ladder For a 14-foot ladder select four pieces of 1 x 2 ha rd wood, using two pieces for each side. Place rungs of 1 x 2 between the side pieces. Make ladder 12 inches wide at top, 14 inches at center, and 30 inches at the bottom. Put a 1/4-inch bolt through the side pieces just below the rungs, and , a 6d nail through the end of each rung to pre vent them from slipping out. Keep all bolts tight.

Never spend your money before you've earned it. Never buy what you do not want; it is not cheap. Orchard Ladder on Wheels The accompanying sketch shows the manner of constru ction. Any farmer or orchardist can build it. Secure two old mower wheels and one piece of 2 x 4 scantling for an axle. Place the ladder upon this scantling. To keep it upright use poles, two at the bottom and one near the top of the ladder, extending to the ground. The upper one should be forked at the top so as to hold the ladder firmly. This ladder is 18 fee t high, and as the foundation is broad, there is no danger of it falling over. The brace is so ma de that it can be adjusted, thus enabling one to place the ladder at any angle. Convenient Sorting Tables Where fruit is packed from the trees a sorting tabl e will always be found convenient. It generally saves time and labor to do the packing ri ght in the orchard. A handy table is one mounted on wheels which may be of any size desired and should be large enough to hold at least four barrels. The wheels can be picked up fro m discarded machinery or quickly made Page 11 of 12 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 6 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices6.html"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"by nailing together crosswise two boards to prevent them from splitting, boring a hole in the center for the axle and rounding them off with a ke y hole saw. One end of the table should be made several inches higher than the other, so th at the culls will roll into a pile at the lower end. In the Hood river district of Oregon a table such a s shown here is commonly used. This is made to accommodate two packers. To make such a tab le take four standards about 3 feet high. It is made 3 x 4 feet in size, the top covere d with strong burlap or canvas and allowed to hang rather loosely. Saw off the tops of the leg s on a bevel so as not to have the sharp corners push into the burlap, or make points that w ill bruise or cut the fruit. A piece of old garden hose is generally nailed arou nd the top of the table to protect the fruit. Besides the braces shown in the cut it is also well to wire the legs and braces together firmly, as there is a heavy load to support. The sh elves on each side are for holding the boxes, as all the good fruit in this region is boxe d. The height is only relative, the point being to construct it so each packer can work with the greatest comfort, avoiding back bending in all cases. The top should not be greater than 3 x 4 feet, as anything larger would not allow two packers to reach all points of it wit hout unnecessary stretching. 1. Workshop and Tools 2. The Steel Square 3.

Fence Wire Reel Here is a device on which one can wind barbed wire that is much better than an old barrel. The reel is mounted on a truck made of old buggy wh eels with short shafts. The cart may be drawn along by a man while a boy steadies the reel to keep it from unwinding too rapidly. For winding up wire, the machine is best pushed jus t fast enough to keep up with the wire as it is being wound on the reel. A crank placed up on the reel proves serviceable in winding up.

Fasten a short piece of plank to the front end of a stone boat. Bore a 2-inch hole in this plank and set the spool of barbed wire on top. Run a piece of gas pipe about 5 feet long through the spool and let the bottom end rest in the hole made in the plank. Attach the stone boat to the rear end of the wagon and have an assistant sit in the wagon and Page 2 of 12 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 7 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices7.html"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"hold the top end of the pipe.

A Boxed Stone Boat A flat stone boat or drag is convenient for many pu rposes, but its uses are limited because it has no great capacity. On page 158 is shown an arra ngement for increasing the utility of a stone boat 100 per cent. It is made of plank and ha s sides 1 foot high. It may be used for the purpose for which the ordinary drag is employed, an d in addition is very convenient for hauling apples, potatoes, or other root crops from the field. By increasing the size of the box, manure can be ha uled out from stables as it is dumped into it from wheelbarrows without having to reload or wheel up an incline. It is low on the ground and very convenient for loading. All light, bulky articles, as well as heavy stones, bags of fertilizers and seed, can easily be hauled on this contrivance. A Homemade Road Roller If you need a road roller get a heavy sheet iron cy linder, stand it on end and place a length of 1-1/2 or 2-inch pipe through the center. The end should be placed on planks which are well soaked or are well oiled, and the pipe braced to keep it exactly in the center. Fill the cylinder with good concrete, and when it has set ti p it over and build a frame for it, so you can hitch a removable tongue at either side. The fr ame should be made of good strong hardwood well braced. The cuts show plainly just ho w the roller is made and put together.

It is han dy for all work, but may need side rails spiked to it, if small stones are to be drawn. Regular boat planks are not easy to obtain now that the old up and down saws are not in use. A Ditching Scraper There should be a ditching scraper on every farm. T hey can be purchased made of steel, but a homemade one costs little and is quite serviceabl e. Take two planks, each 10 inches wide and 3 feet long, of good 2-inch hardwood. Bolt to t hem securely a pair of old plow handles. To the bottom bolt an old crosscut saw blade which will make a sharp edge. Let this project about an inch at the bottom. Attach two singletree hooks near each end of the lower board and your scraper is ready to use. With this scraper and two men a ditch can be cut one- quarter mile long and as deep as it could be plowed with a turning plow in two days' time.

Should the so il be such that water percolates through it, face the soil with loam on top and puddle it well. If this leaks, face it with clay and puddle the clay. These rules apply to all dams made of sto ne and earth. Pipes entering reservoirs should enter at the botto m and the soil be well puddled around them to prevent the water working through beside th e pipe. Each pipe must have a strainer over its supply end and have no air holes in its en tire length. A good strainer can be made from a piece of large lead pipe punched full of hol es. One end may be flattened or turned over and the other drawn on over the end of the wat er pipe. Let nobody suppose that simple, inexpensive arrangements are faulty because primiti ve. If constructed correctly and in line with natural laws, they are not only all right, but are preferable to fancy, complicated devices that get out of order easily or in a year o r two and require a master mechanic to put them into working condition again. Getting a Supply of Fuel PLAN for getting up the year's supply of fuel is suggested as follows: Fell the trees on the ground with a small sapling under them, so a log chain can be passed beneath. Then a logging bob (Figure I) is ti pped up on its side near the end of the log; a chain is hooked to the bolster near the grou nd, passed under the log and over the top runner of the bob and the team hitched to the end o f the chain. A quick pull of the team and the bob comes down on both runners, with the log on the top of the bolster.

The limbs are trimmed in the woods, drawn on a pair of bobs to th e shop, where there is a three-horse power boiler and two-horse power engine, and are sa wed at the rate of 1-1/2 cords an hour with a buzz saw. A handy device can be made of two crotched limbs, a s shown in Figure 3, to saw large limbs on. A 2-inch auger hole is bored where the li mbs branch, and a hardwood limb driven tightly into the hole. The following described device (Figure 4) is very h andy to hold and lower the tree after sawing the stump off. [a, planks with holes bored i n them; b, log; c, chain; d, crotched limb; e e, lever; f , iron pins.] It is made of two hardwood planks abo ut 8 x 5 inches and 1-1/2 inches thick bolted together at the top and bottom, with a 2-inch space between for the lever to work in. One-inch holes are bored through the si des of both planks, in which iron pins are placed for the lever to pry over. The lever is made of white ash, and has two notches near the large end, with a chain link attached midway be tween notches. A stout chain is hooked in the link, passed under the log, and attached to a crotched limb leaning slightly against the opposite side of the log. By working the small end of the lever up and down and moving the pins up one hole at a time, a good-sized tree can b e raised from the ground high enough to be sawed easily without a backache.

These are pressed into the ground 8 or 10 feet apart, according to the size of the tent , and brought together and fastened at the upper ends with such a joint as is shown, or with a string passing through a screw-eye in each pole, if a simpler method is preferred. The tent is made from four triangular pieces of clo th, as suggested in Figure 2. One of these is cut up the center and hemmed, to afford an entra nce to the tent. The triangular pieces are sewed together at the edges and at two of the oppos ite corners pieces of stout cord are sewed into the corners of the cloth, the cloth bein g reinforced as suggested in the cut. Two stout pegs of wood and two lighter ones are pro vided. To pitch the tent, put up the two frame poles A-fashion and draw the tent cloth over them, opposite seams and corners fitting over the poles. Draw out the other two corners and tie by the ropes to the stout pegs which have been driven into the ground. The two lighter p egs are used to fasten back the flaps of the front.

Set a strong post 4 feet in the ground in the middle of the gateway and balance the gate on it. The lower rail is made of two forked sassafras pole s securely nailed together so as to work around the post.

Mat erial to be used depends largely on the purpose for which the gate is made. For a paddock o r pasture gate, make it out of seasoned boards 1 x 6 inches, 12 or 14 feet long. The posts supporting the gate are about 5 inches apart, the one on the inside being about 8 inches a head of the other. They are joined together by cleats or rollers which support the gat e and allow it to be pushed back and swing open. If rollers are not obtainable, cleats m ade of any hard wood are good. They need not be heavier than 1 x 4 inches. If the gate is to be used for a hog pasture, the lower cleats on both sets of posts should be placed just above t he lower board to prevent the hogs from lifting it up. An Easily Regulated Gate The gate hanger illustrated in the drawing is very handy for use where it is desired to let hogs pass from one pasture to another while cows ar e confined to one. As shown, the hanger is a piece of strap iron bent around the pos t and supported by pegs. These pegs may be inserted in holes at varying heights. Raise the gate to let the hogs through and lower it to keep them in, of course. This is also a good device for raising the gate above the snow in winter. Many would find this use of the adjustable hanger preferable to the gates made to raise only one end for snow. Of course it is desira ble that there should be the least play as possible while the hanger slides up and down freely , and special care should be taken to set the post firmly. Otherwise the gate would sag. Gate to Overcome Snowdrifts Page 3 of 9 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 8 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices8.html"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":" In the picture is shown a gate which can be readily adjusted to swing over snowdrifts. It is easily made from ordinary lumber. A 1 x 6-inch upri ght is used for the lower boards, 1 x 4 for the upper ones. The uprights at the hinge post are double 1 x 4, one piece outside and the other inside the bars. The upright at the latch sid e may be the same weight of stuff or slightly lighter, and fastened in the same way. Ins tead of nailing the bars to these uprights, bolts are used, one for each bar at each end. The l owest board is notched as shown, and the double brace used from the top of the latch post to the bottom of the hinge post. For the brace, 1 x 3 stuff is strong enough. They are joine d near the bottom with a bolt, which engages with the notches when the gate is raised, a s shown at the right. A Time Saver To open and close gates that stock may be kept with in bounds the year round is one thing which uses up a great deal of time, and makes no re turn. Every gate should be so made that it will fall into place of its own weight and stay closed and open without hitch or bother. The cut illustrates a convenient thing that should be in larger use on farms. It is always open and always closed against stock. Put up and well pa inted, it will last for many years. He who keeps company with great men is the last at the table and the first at any toil or danger. Keep the Gate Open A simple and handy device which serves to hold the gate open is shown in the cut. To make it, procure a board, a , 1 x 4 x 12 inches and saw out a portion in the center, leaving a space on each side 1/2 inch wide, and bore holes for a bolt. Next get an 8-inch stick, b , and bore a hole through Page 4 of 9 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 8 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices8.html"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"it 3 inches from the top. Bevel the top so that the gate will pass over it, and it will then fall back and hold the gate open. When one's hands and arms are full of things, as they often are on a farm, it is a great convenience to have a gate or door held open automatically. No simpler or more effective device for the purpose can be found. A similar device can be adapted to use as a latch to catch an d keep a gate or door closed. Good Bars for the Farm It is an important matter to the farmer that his fa rm should be well equipped with good, substantial bars. Some farmers go to as much troubl e in a year's time in moving a poor gate or bars back and forth as they drive in and out of fields, and in chasing cattle about, as making dozens of such bars as are represented here. Use round poles about 2-1/2 or 3 inches in diameter. Set two good-sized posts one on either side of the barway, and to each one, an equal distance apart, nail large horseshoes, allowi ng the round part to stand out far enough from posts to admit the bar poles easily. Durable Floating Fence This is a cheap and easy way to make a good, strong cable on which to hang a water gate, when it becomes necessary to have a fence cross a s tream: Set two good, large posts about 3 feet deep in the ground and about 6 feet from the b anks of the stream. Get a piece of wire (barbed wire will do, but smooth wire makes a much better looking job), long enough to go from one post around the other and back again about six times, being careful to fasten each end securely at the proper height from the ground. Then get a strong piece of wood about 1x3 inches and about 4 feet long, stand as near the middle of the space between the two posts as possible, and place the stick between the two sets of wires. Turn around until all the wires are well twisted together, being careful not to twist too much. On withdrawing the stick, the wires will only untwi st two or three times. After the gate is hung, the stick may be again inserted in the same p lace and several more twists given to take up the sag caused by the weight of the gate. T hen fasten one end of the stick to the top of gate and it will be impossible for the cable to untwist any more. This has been found to answer all the purposes of an expensive cable and l ooks and lasts just as well. Fence Across a Stream To construct a fence across a creek or small stream , set a post on each bank and brace well.

Then fasten wire securely on posts, leaving enough slack so a weight in the m iddle will draw the wires toward the bed of the stream, thus making it impossible for stock of any size to get through. A large stone makes a good weight. It can be blocked up to desire d height and fastened in position with smooth wire. Temporary Sheep Fence One of the best portable fences for use in soiling sheep is made in panels with supports, as shown. Panels are 10 feet long, made of 4-inch boar d solidly nailed together. After this fence is once put up, sheep are not likely to overt urn it. A fence 3-1/2 feet high will turn most flocks. Fastening Heavy Doors There is little difference in the effectiveness of these two locks for heavy doors. The left- hand device is extremely quick and handy; the other very neat and substantial. The lock to the left has both bars pivoted to a lever handle, w hich is pivoted to the door midway between the ends of the arms. Moving the lever hand le up moves both arms out of slots above and below the doors. The fastening may be als o worked from the inside by cutting a slot through the door and setting a pin in one of t he arms, so that it can be moved in the slot. The right-hand fastening is worked by raising the l ower arm so that the notch incloses the middle staple at d. Then the upper arm can be pulled down. Both arms st ay firm and snug whether the door is shut or open.

The framework, when raised, should be plumb, so tha t all on or in the building can be cut square, and applied without tedious fitting. The si ding should be thoroughly seasoned in the open air before using, and carefully applied with c lose joints, and well nailed. The edges of all water tables, corner boards, and window frames should be painted before setting. The shingles should be carefully laid, breaking the ir joints at one-third of their width and double nailed. The flooring should be dry, close la id, and nailed with two nails to each beam. The partitions should be set with studding of selected width, and their angles or corners should be anchored firmly together to preve nt the walls from cracking in those parts when finished. The chimneys should be carefully con structed, all points between the brickwork should be well filled with mortar to prev ent sparks from passing through to the framework. All mortar for plastering should be properly mixed, and allowed sufficient time (at least a week) for the thorough slacking of the lime, and a complete permeation of the caustic properties. Thin coats of plastering are better tha n heavy ones. A mortar that does not crack in setting or drying is sure to be good. The interior wood finish should not be begun until the plastering is completely dried out, and all loose mortar is removed from the building. All woodwork usually painted should be primed as soon as in position.

Two cleats were nailed on each, about 3 inc hes from the ends. These were for pallets and cost about 7-1/2 cents each. The cement blocks were 8 x 9 x 18. As the block machine had no attachments, some contrivances were made for making half stone, three-quarter and others. For caps and sills for doors and windows 9-inch boa rds were taken, using three for each mold, and two holes 2 inches from the edges and 3 o r 4 inches from the ends of two of them were bored. Then the farmer made cement blocks for the ends 9 x 8 inches, laid the other Page 5 of 15 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 9 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices9a.html"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"board on the ground, placed one of the others on ea ch side of it edgewise, put in the end blocks, and through the holes put long bolts and bo lted it tight together. Then it was ready to fill with concrete. These boards were as long as were needed to make the caps or sills. A sprinkler, sand shovel, plasterer's trowel, and a w ire sieve of 1/4-inch mesh were obtained. The sand cost nothing except hauling. The machine w as set up near a spring. A box something like a wagon bed with both ends out was m ade of boards, the block machine placed in one end and the pile of sand at one side. Three shovels of sand and one of cement were placed in a tub and mixed thoroughly. Then a b oy took the sprinkler and sprinkled it while another mixed, until it was dampened evenly a ll through. Then they spread 35 shovels of sand in the mixing box and shook one sack of cem ent over it, which made a five-to-one mixture. This was thoroughly mixed by shoveling and sprinkling until it was good and damp, but not wet. This quantity made ten blocks. A pallet was placed on the open machine, the machin e closed, and some of the richer mixture of concrete placed on the face about 1 inch thick. The mold was then filled with the five-to-one mixture, while one of the boys tamped i t, put in the core, and smoothed off the top with a trowel. The core was then carefully lift ed out, the machine opened, and the pallet with the stone on it placed on a level piece of gro und. In three or four hours the blocks were ready to spr inkle. When 30 hours old they were placed on end and the pallets used for more stone. After standing for two days, during which time they were sprinkled frequently to keep t hem damp, they were dumped in the creek, where they were left until ready for use. Th e foundations were made by first putting into a trench about 6 inches of broken rock, then 4 inches of concrete. The house is 26 feet square, the walls 12 feet high , with gables north and south. The picture of the house and arrangement of the two floors are shown in the illustrations. We used 12,400 pounds of cement, which cost 60c per 100, or $74.40. Doors and windows were brought at a cost of $33.75. Chimney, plastering an d lumber for floors, roof, partitions and finishing, all of the best, cost $240. The hardware was $30, making the total cost of house $378.15, not counting cement machine or labor, all of which was done by the family.

The barn here illustrated has 26 sides nearly 12 feet long, makin g a barn 94 feet in diameter. The sills, plates and roof in a strictly round barn are very e xpensive, and the work will not last as well as when built as shown. The floor space of the firs t floor is nearly the same as if round, and the hay loft is very little smaller. If the buildin g is round, the walls should be lathed with metal lath, over rough boxing, and plastered with t wo coats of portland cement. In fact, this finish is to be preferred in building any shaped ba rn, as it requires no paint and practically no repairs. The floor plan of the barn shown is self-explanator y. It has stalls for 40 milch cows, three bull pens, two hospital stalls, pen for baby beef t hat will accommodate about 2 1/2 cars of calves, stalls for seven horses, including the two box stalls, and the feeding room and silo. The silo is 16 x 34 feet, will hold about 140 tons of silage, and requires about ten acres of average corn to fill. The hay loft has 166,500 cubic feet of space, and d educting the silo and bins for ground feed will hold 300 tons of loose hay. The ground fe ed is stored in hopper-shaped bins above the feed room, and drawn down through small spouts as wanted. The hay is handled with hay forks, and to locate the trolleys as near the r oof as possible, trap doors are left in the loft floor, and the hay hoisted from the driveways. A ci rcle trolley may be installed, or two straight ones. Several large hay doors are also bui lt in the outside walls above the loft floor. The silo, the floors of the cow stalls, including t he gutters and mangers, also the 8-foot driveway around the silo, are of cement, and, while it is intended to install litter and feed carriers, it is also intended to drive around the e ntire barn, or the feed floor with a cart if Page 7 of 15 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 9 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices9a.html"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"desired. The interior arrangement of first floor ma y, of course, be changed in several ways, and the cows faced in the opposite direction, etc., or stalls and other equipment arranged for different stock.

The ventilation is always much bette r in the round barn, the work of caring for and feeding may be accomplished with less labor , there are never any drafts on the stock, the building may be built for less money, an d is much stronger. As shown, the barn has a stone foundation, the roof is covered with as bestos roofing felt, and the walls covered with 6-inch drop siding. Everything is of the best, and all exposed woodwork painted two coats. This building would cost about $4,700 withou t the cow stanchions.

A Well-Arranged Barn This Kentucky barn has a frame of oak, 6 x 6 inches . Center posts 23 feet 9 inches; shed posts 16 feet tall; studding and braces 2 x 6-inch poplar; joists 2 x 10-inch poplar, oak and pine. The sheeting is of poplar, beech and ash. The bevel siding is select poplar. Cornice and base, white pine. All doors are two thicknesses , front is dressed cypress and the back dressed white pine. The lower windows are 10 x 12-i nch, 12 lights and upper ones inside the building. The joists are set 20 inches from cen ter to center. The loft is 8-1/2 feet from lower floors. The floor plan shows the arrangement as follows: Nu mber 1, icehouse, 18 feet deep, walled up with stone; 2, carriage house, 16 x 18 feet; 3, stairs, leading to lumber room over carriage room; 4, corn crib, 8 x 16 feet, over whic h are the grain bins for wheat and oats. These bins have chutes running down into the corn c rib, from which grain is filled into sacks. Numbers 5, 5, are box stalls, 8 x 12 feet; 6 , driveway, 12 x 38 feet; 7, 7, 7, 7, box stalls, 6-1/2 x 12 feet; 8, harness room, 6 x 8 fee t; 9, feed mixing room, 6 x 8 feet, with spouts running from cutting box and bran bins overh ead; 10, alleyway running from driveway to feed alley; 11, 11, 11, hay chutes, wit h openings near the bottom, 1 x 2 feet. These openings are directly over the feed boxes and any hay that falls while horses are feeding goes into the boxes and none is wasted. Num ber 12, feed boxes, 1 x 2 x 2 feet; 13, feeding alley, 4 x 38 feet. Overhead at X is an opening from the hay loft where alfalfa, clover, cowpeas and hay are kept for the cows; 14, cow shed, 8 x 38 feet. Cows are fastened with stanchions and fed out Page 8 of 15 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 9 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices9a.html"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"of boxes on alley floor. The cow shed has concrete floor, with a fall of 2 inches from stanchion to Number 15, the drain basin, which is 1 foot 2 inches wide and 1 foot deep at A, where it runs into a basin made of concrete, 6 x 6 feet and 2 feet deep; 16, driveway into carriage room; 17, openings in which siding doors h ang when open; 18, windows. The roof is of tin, standing seams, with Yankee gut ters made on the lower edge of the roof. An opening 10 x 10 feet in the center of the drivew ay loft is allowed for hay and other feed taken up by an unloader that runs on a track in com b of roof. The barn will cost about $1,500 -- more or less, according to cost of buildi ng material where it is erected. A Handy Small Barn This barn is arranged to meet the needs of a small farm. It can be built in most localities at a cost not to exceed $500, and if a farmer has his ow n timber, at even less cost. The outside dimensions are 36 x 48 feet, and it is 16 feet to t he eaves, with a curb roof. The stables should be about 8 feet high, which allows plenty of loft room above for hay. In the floor plan the cow stalls, A, can be made of any width desired, 3-1/2 feet being best for general purposes. At B are two large box stalls for cows with young calves. The mangers, C, are 18 inches wide, with a rack for hay or fodder above. At D is the feed room and alley, which is 8 feet wide. At E are the mange rs for the horses, with a feed box at the right side. At F are three horse stalls 4 feet wide , in which horses can be tied. At G is a large box stall for mares and colts. At H is provided the granary, which can be subdivid ed into bins as necessary. The portion I is the driveway, which affords ample storage space for tools, wagons, etc., and is used as a driveway when hay is being elevated into the loft a bove. There is a large corn crib, J, at the end, which ca n be filled from the outside and emptied from the inside. It is narrow and so arranged that the corn will dry out quickly. Chutes from this bin should be provided at L. A ladder to the h ay loft at K is a convenience which should not be omitted.

The melting from the sides, bottom and top is caused by insufficient insulation . The waste from the bottom is generally the greatest. The amount of ice melted in the botto m of the icehouse varies from 1 to 6 feet during the year, depending upon the construction of the floor. If the icehouse is provided with an airtight floor, with the ice laid on at lea st 18 inches of dry sawdust, the bottom waste rarely exceeds 12 inches during the year; on the other hand, if the ice is piled in the icehouse on the bare ground without any insulation under it, or any provision made for drainage, the meltage frequently is 6 feet. The sid e and top meltage is not so great, but it frequently ranges from 1 to 3 feet, depending upon the insulation. Location and Building The location should be where the ice can be removed and delivered with the least amount of labor; however, it is very important that the iceho use should be located in the coolest place, in as dry a place as possible, and always above gro und. The lowest layer of ice should always be at least 6 inches above the outside level of ground. The size of the building must be determined by the amount of ice used during the year. For instance, a dairy farm upon which 35 cows are kept, and from which the milk is sold, needs an icehouse 16 x 16 and 14 feet high. If the cream is to be sold and skim milk fed to the calves, immediately from the separator, an icehouse 14 x 14 and 12 feet high is of sufficient size. In both cases we make allowance for the use o f 25 pounds of ice per day during the summer months for household purposes. For a man who keeps about 20 cows and sells the milk, an icehouse 14 x 14 and 12 feet high is of su fficient size; however, in no case should an icehouse be smaller than 12 x 12 and 10 feet hig h, because the outside surface is too great, compared with the volume, and, therefore, to o much ice is wasted in proportion to the amount used. The building should be as near the shape of a cube as possible, for the cube contains the greatest amount of volume with the least amount of surface exposed other than circular forms. It is not always practical to build as high as we build square, owing to the amount of labor and the inconvenience of storing the ice; the refore, the dimensions given are really the most practical. Page 10 of 15 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 9 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices9a.html"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":" If the icehouse is not built upon a sandy surface a nd where rapid drainage is natural, it is necessary to cut a space to a depth of 12 to 18 inc hes, where the icehouse is to be located, lay a tile drain to drain this, and fill it with sa nd or finely crushed stone. Put a 6-inch foundation of concrete of the size you wish to buil d your ice-house in this pit, and fill around the outside. Framing the Icehouse The framework is made by laying 2 x 4-inch sill on the concrete foundation; fasten this to the foundation by cementing a few bolts into the co ncrete and allowing them to extend through the sill; 2 x 4 studding are then placed up on the sill, 16 inches apart from center to center. The rafters for the roof are likewise made of 2 x 4's, placed the same distance apart as the studding, but the purlin plate upon the stud ding should be at least 6 inches wide. The outside of studding may be boarded either with comm on sheeting and paper, upon which poplar siding is nailed, or with patent siding or s hip-lap siding, the latter being the cheapest and requiring only a single thickness of board. The roof should be made with not less than one-half to one-third pitch, and preferably covered with shingles, for shingles are better insu lators than either slate or metal. Paper may sometimes be used to good advantage. A cupola or fl ue should be built upon the roof to allow for the removal of the warm air from the top of the ice. A ventilator may be placed in the gable end. A continuous door should be cut in one end to allow the ice to be put in. This door may extend from the gable down to within 5 feet of the bottom. Before putting in the ice place from 18 inches to 2 feet of sawdust or dry peat upon the floor. The ice should be harvested in regular shape , oblong, rather than square, and not less than 18 inches in width and 30 inches in length. Ice and Milk Houses Combined Page 11 of 15 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 9 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices9a.html"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":" The side elevation of an icehouse with milkhouse at tached is presented in the drawing, It shows the advantage of utilizing the water from the icehouse for cooling the milk. No ice needs to be removed from the icehouse. It operates automatically. If the weather is warm the ice melts more rapidly and keeps water in the t ank at the required temperature. Small Greenhouses The farmer who would make his crops of vegetables m ost profitable, or the small gardener who would have an early supply of early vegetables for home use or market must employ some kind of glass structures to hasten these crops . The hot-bed or cold frame have been much in use in the past, but the cost of sash, shut ters and mats is nearly as much as the materials needed for a permanent structure, while t he labor of caring for cold frames or hotbeds is often much more than that of the small g reenhouse. In the latter one may work with comfort no matter what the weather may be outs ide. It requires much more skill to run hotbeds successfully. Small greenhouses may be built against the south si de of the house or stable, Figures 1 and 2, or they may be built entirely away from other bu ildings, but the shelter of larger buildings on the north or west will be found of gre at advantage. If one has a basement to the house or stable, a lean-to house may be built, and heat from the open cellar in a large measure will heat the greenhouse in the mild weathe r of fall and spring. Material for Construction A cheap and efficient house may be made by setting chestnut or cedar posts in the ground, covering the sides with lining boards, then two thi cknesses of tarred building paper and sheathing outside, Figure 3. Cement, stone or brick will be cheaper in the end. The durability of glass structures will depend much upo n the form of the materials. Clear cypress is now more used than any other material. S ills should be of the form shown in Page 12 of 15 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 9 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices9a.html"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Figure 4. Plates may be made of plank as in Figure 3, or as in Figure 5. Sash bars should have grooves along the sides to catch the drip from the glass, as in Figure 6. The glass for ordinary work may be No. 2 double thi ck, large sizes, 16 x 20 inches or 20 x 24 inches, being much used. Smaller sizes will be c heaper in price, but more sash bars will be needed, and they cut off much of the sunlight. T he glass should be put in with putty, made with about one-third white lead in it, and fir mly tacked with triangular zinc tacks of large size, or the double-pointed tacks, which are so bent as to prevent the glass from slipping down. Set Glass in Warm Weather Glazing should be done during the summer or early f all, as putty will soon become loose if frozen before well hardened. In building there should be no mortises, but all jo ints be made by toeing in with long, slender nails. All woodwork should be thoroughly pa inted before fitting, and all joints filled with white lead paint. After all is done the frame should be painted before the glass is put in. The most important and expensive feature of the sma ll greenhouse is the heating. If one has a hot water or steam heater in the house, to which the glass house is attached, it will be a very simple matter to carry pipes through, as at a, a, Figures 1 and 2. Hot air also may be let into such houses, or a small kerosene heater in ver y cold weather may be used, if the house is built opening into the cellar. Ventilators must be located as shown in Figures 1 a nd 2, at b, b. Very small structures may be run without much heat if opening into cellars or other heated rooms by having shutters or curtains to draw down at night and in very cold, cl oudy weather. Covering with Hotbed Sash Houses of small size may be made by building a fram e upon which hotbed sash may be screwed. If one has the sash this is a cheap way of building, and such a house has the advantage that the sash may be entirely removed dur ing the summer, but it is very difficult to make a close house with such sash. The woodwork of greenhouses and hotbed sash should have a coat of thin linseed oil paint every second year. Much of the success to be obtain ed from any glass structure will depend upon the skill of the operator, and the thermometer , both outside and in, must be watched very closely. The temperature should be maintained as nearly as possible like that in the open air under which the plants grown thrive the be st. Wire Fence Corn Crib Page 13 of 15 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 9 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices9a.html"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":" In the drawing is shown a handy, inexpensive corn c rib, which possesses several advantages not possessed by the ordinary slat corn crib. It is made on 4 x 4-inch posts, with pans at their tops, to prevent rats from climbing in. The s ills are 4 x 4-inch, the scantlings 2 x 4, and 2 feet apart. The fencing is nailed to these on all sides, and the door frame is similarly covered. The roof is made wide, so as to shed all p ossible water. The height, length and width may suit the farmer's convenience. A convenie nt width is about 5 feet at the floor, widening to 7 feet at the eaves. Owing to the very open nature of this crib, corn dries more quickly than in a slat crib, and as there is less c hance for water to lodge in the cracks, the crib will be more durable than if built entirely of wood. Want of cure does us more damage than want of knowl edge. How to Lay a Floor To lay a floor or board ceiling just right, and do the work fast, use a good lever, as in the illustration, taking for the supports two 1 x 4-inc h pieces as long as the width of the room. The upright arm is 4 feet long with a hole 4 inches from the lower and through which it is pinned loosely between the ends of the supports. Wi th a little practice, a good carpenter's job can be done on floor or ceiling. An Inexpensive Veranda A vine-covered veranda is a great comfort, but in m any cases the expense seems greater than the owner of the plain little farmhouse feels able to stand. A farmer in Arkansas wanted one, and he set to work in this fashion. Fir st he went to the woods and got a load of straight poles about 1 - 1/2 inches in diameter and from 8 to 12 feet long. He n ext procured a Page 14 of 15 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 9 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices9a.html"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"number of nice, smooth boards for the flooring of t he veranda, making it about 6 feet wide and 10 feet long and strengthening it with the nece ssary timbers. He securely nailed the poles about 8 inches apart around the flooring to f orm an inclosure, leaving an opening in front about 5 feet wide. The poles in front were 7 feet from the floor to th e roof and 12 feet at the house. About midway of their height the poles were straightened by a row of poles nailed horizontally and another row was placed at the top. To make all secu re against rain, the slanting roof poles were next carefully covered with overlapping rows o f bark. All this required but small outlay of cash and even less of work. It was then r eady for the vines. Being in haste for immediate results, the builder p lanted some roots of the hard native woodbine, which will soon cover any space with its rapid growth. It is an easy matter to sow seed of the morning glory, hardy annual gourd, or any one of several hardy climbers and the result will soon be a mass of shade and lov ely blossoms besides, all of which makes the summer evenings pass far more pleasantly. 1.

Today is the age of concrete. It is crowding wood a nd steel into the background, and bids fair to become the most universal of building mater ials. Concrete is extensively used by the largest landholders, and can be used by the men of more moderate means to equal advantage. It is to be recommended for general use by reason of its durability, sanitary qualities and moderate cost. Molded solid, it has n o joints nor seams to afford a lodging for dirt and foster the growth of noxious fungi; it can be swept, washed, scrubbed and scalded, without injury to its texture. Further, it does not possess the disagreeable quality of absorbing gases and odors. Add to these qualities, coolness in summer, warmth in winter and we have one of the most logical building materi als in present-day use. Concrete is not expensive when compared with other materials of construction, such as stone, brick and wood. To be sure, the initial cost of wood is less than that of concrete, but when we consider the life and quality of the finish ed product, concrete is easily cheaper than wood. Portland cement of the most approved brands costs a bout $1.60 per barrel, 1-1/4 barrels of cement being required for each cubic yard of concre te. Sand and gravel may be had from the farm or bought nearby at 10 cents a load. Add t he cost of the forms and the labor of mixing and laying the concrete, which should be don e at an expense not exceeding 75 cents per yard, and we have a total expense ranging from $2.75 to $3 per cubic yard, but under very favorable circumstances the cost may be reduce d close to $2. Experience both in practical work and in the laboratory has proved bey ond a doubt that the best brands of cement, as in all other goods, are the cheapest in the end, and should be insisted upon by all prospective purchasers. Atlas, Alpha, Saylor's, Edi son and Giant cements are among the leading brands. The sand should be clean, coarse an d sharp and free from all foreign matter that would in any way tend to weaken the concrete. Broken stone with sand and cement makes an ideal mixture, but it is objected to on ac count of the cost of the broken stone. Gravel may be substituted for the stone, however, w ith excellent results. The gravel should be washed and cleaned, and, if very coarse, passed through a screen. The gravel should range from 1/4 inch to 2-1/2 inches in diameter, but should not ex ceed 2-1/2 inches and to obtain the very best results the major portion shou ld be between the limits of 1 and 1-1/2 inches. Mixing the Cement In mixing concrete for general use the following pr oportions are perhaps the best: One Small farms Page 1 of 10 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 9b 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices9b.html"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"barrel cement to 3 barrels sand and 5 barrels grave l. In this mixture the spaces between the stones are entirely filled and when hardened the co ncrete virtually becomes a solid monolith. To secure the best results mix the concrete as foll ows: Have the gravel washed and in readiness, usually on a platform of planking or boa rds, to permit easy shoveling and insure against waste. Add enough water to the cement and s and, which have been thoroughly mixed in a mortar bed, to make a thin mortar, not t oo thin, however, to permit easy shoveling. Spread the mortar on the gravel and thor oughly mix by turning with shovels. Then, without delay, shovel the batch of concrete i nto the forms or spread it on the floors as the case may be, being careful not to exceed layers of 8 inches at each filling. Each layer must be tamped and rammed till water flushes to the top. Proceed in this manner till the forms are filled. I n hot weather damp cloths or boards should be placed over the top of the concrete to keep it f rom checking after the final layer has been placed in the forms. The forms must necessarily be water tight and the concrete worked back from the boards with a spade, so the softer ma terial may flow to the outside and insure a smooth surface. If this last is not done holes wi ll surely result and the work will be disappointing. Let the concrete rest four to six da ys before removing the planking, concrete being somewhat brittle until thoroughly hardened, a nd while in the \"green\" state easily broken. Making Concrete Blocks Concrete building blocks are ideal as building mate rial on the farm. The cost to purchase these blocks has been beyond the reach of the farme r who desired to use them for all purposes; but by the use of the simple machine or m old described anyone can make the best quality of hollow concrete building blocks at an av erage cost of less than 6 cents each, the mere cost of sand and cement. As the standard size block is 20 x 8 x 7-1/2 inches , instructions are given for making the machine to build that size, but it can be construct ed to turn out any size of block by changing the dimensions accordingly. Take two boards 20 inches long by 7-1/2 inches wide and 1 inch thick. These are for the sides. For the ends use lumber 10 inches long by 7- 1/2 inches wide. Care must be used to have the boards free from large knots and with an e ven grain, so as to avoid warping. The above four boards were joined at three corners with six hinges; two hinges at top and bottom of each corner. In putting together have the two end boards set up against the sides as shown in Figure I. At the fourth corner place a strong hook and eyelet to hold the machine together when making block, and by unhookin g this allows the machine to be folded back away from the finished work, etc. Page 2 of 10 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 9b 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices9b.html"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"This makes a mold or form that is, inside measureme nts, 20 inches long, 8 inches wide and 7-1/2 inches high, with top and bottom open. For the core, take two boards of 1-inch lumber, cut ting them 13 inches at the top and slanting to 11-1/2 inches at the bottom with a widt h of 7-1/2 inches. These make the sides of core. For the ends, use 2-inch strips cut 7-1/2 inches long. These are fastened together, as shown in Figure I. This makes a slanting box which is set inside of the machine, as illustrated in Figure 2, and forms the hollow in th e block. To the top of the core a round stick is fitted into place the length of the core, so it will set down level with the top for a handle to lift the core from the block when operati ng the same. To Operate the Machine First set it on a board somewhat larger than the ma chine, as shown in Figure 2. This makes the bottom of machine and holds the block until dry . Enough of these boards must be provided for the blocks made each day. Close the ma chine and fasten catch, then set the core in the center and fill the space around the sa me with the concrete mixture, tamping it in thoroughly. When full level off the top with a flat stick and carefully lift out the core, setting it on another board ready for the next bloc k, unhook the catch and fold the machine back away from the finished block and you have the completed block ready to dry and cure. This method requires no handling and so has no dang er of breaking while the block is yet \" green,\" as it remains on the board or \"pallet\" unti l dry enough to be piled up, which they will be in three or four days. When the blocks are to be laid in a side wall, betw een corners, take two 1-1/2-inch strips 7- 1/2 inches long and attach with screws to the cente r of each end of machine on the inside. This molds a groove in the block, which is filled w ith mortar when laying the block in the wall and so securely ties it. By fastening with scr ews these strips can be easily removed when molding corner blocks. Blocks of Different Shapes A neat panel block can be molded by taking the comm on half-round strips, cutting to the right lengths and fastening to the outside of the f ace of machine, as shown in Figure I. For corner blocks they can be attached to either end of machine. By using small screws these can be removed when not desired and also enable you to panel either right or left end of block as needs require. For making half-size blocks, have a piece of board that is exactly 8 inches wide and 7-1/2 inches high, or so it will just fit into machine wh en core is removed. Set this in place in the middle half-way between the ends and fill with mate rial. This will make two half-size blocks for use in breaking joints when laying wall. If desired to have these hollow, two small cores of proper size can be made to set in pl ace when molding blocks of this size. Rock face effects can be produced very easily by ta king a 2-inch plank the size of the face of machine or the end as desired. On this draw a bo rder 1-1/2 inches all around, then take several irons, heat them red-hot and burn out the c enter in irregular shape, at least 1-1/4 inches deep. By making ridges and hollows in this b urning process of different depths and as broken as possible, you will secure a face plate that will mold a very excellent imitation of a rock face. This, of course, can be made to sui t any fancy. One may follow the practice of making several faces and ends from plain and panels down to different rock effects, having these extra face plates the same size as given for the machine above. Then by using hinges as used on door s or any pin hinge, you can easily change the style of block by putting one face plate or end on machine in a moment's time.

The platform on which this mold rests should be 14 x 24 inches and be well battened together. The sides are made as shown by the drawings, with a cleat on each end, which overlaps the end pieces and holds them i n place. Both ends and sides are fastened to the platform as shown, with hinges, whi ch permit them to be turned down to take out the completed block.

The end pieces of mold have a thin piece of board running up and d own to form a key between blocks and should run down to top of bottom board. The plugs are made as shown, with a taper both side s, so that when they are removed they clear all the way out. The pins in the bottoms of t he plugs are to fit in the holes in the bottom board, which will steady them and hold them in place. When the plugs are removed the board with the two s quare holes is placed over the top of mold and the handle of tamper is run through the ri ngs in top of plugs and they are lifted up. This board is used as a guard and prevents the bloc k from being broken when plugs are removed, and should not be used until the block is finished and ready to take out of mold. The tamper is made of a large iron nut and a piece of iron rod about 18 inches long. Filling the Molds To make these blocks use one part of portland cemen t and three parts of good sharp sand, mix well and put enough water on to simply dampen t he whole. Now close up the mold, put plugs in place, fill the mold one-fourth full and t amp down hard. Repeat this until the mold is filled. Scrape off surplus material, remove the plugs, then turn down sides and lift out finished block which is to remain on the bottom boa rd until hard enough to lift off. It will be necessary to have a number of these bott om boards. After a number of blocks are made they should be sprinkled from day to day for f rom 15 to 20 days to properly cure them before using. A barrel of cement will make about 50 blocks and one man can make a block in 12 minutes. Mixing Cement for Brick Many have found mixing the sand and cement the hard est part of cement brick making. An old vinegar barrel may be put to use by placing a g rindstone crank on one end and a pinion on the other. Two strong posts are set in the groun d and the barrel hung over two pieces of round iron driven into the posts. A square hole is cut on side of barrel and covered with a piece of sheet iron hinged and a bottom to fasten.

Reinforcement for Concrete For heavy construction work involving beams and col umns, reinforcement with steel rods is needed. Reinforced concrete is rapidly coming to be the most approved kind of construction of large buildings. Our own great building is one o f the most noteworthy examples, being of reinforced concrete throughout. For any building wh ere reinforcement seems desirable the following details will be found useful: Plan of the footing or foundation of each column is shown in f ; g, side view of footing and part of column above. The steel rods that run up th rough column are shown by dots in h, and the wire spiral by diagonal lines in g. h is cross-section of column filled with cement, the shaded part being the concrete. a, section of floor slab, 4-1/2 inches thick; it is al so shown on top of the floor girder and floor beam (cr ossbeams between girders), b, girder; c, cross-section of girder, the dots showing twisted s teel bars that take up the tensile stress -- compression stress is carried by the concrete. The steel bars, d, stuck into the column at an angle, are to prevent the girders from breaking off or \"shearing\" at column. Making a Frostproof Cellar Some farmers build their own concrete cellar walls and chimneys with inexperienced help.

Have outside line of excavation plumb. Then use 2 x 4-inch studs the len gth required. Point one end, drive in ground, on line of inside of cellar wall, brace top of stud by driving stake in ground, and nail brace to stake and each stud. You must make ev erything firm. Then take square edge boards and place horizontally against the studs. Do not try to go around the whole cellar wall, take one side at a time to the height of earth surface, but turn your corner. Pay no attention to outside, let the stone and cement push up against the earth. It is the best plan to finish th e whole wall up to the earth surface line before making the elevation above the ground line. Above the earth surface line do just the same on th e outside as you have been doing on the inside, but now you must use boards and studs, as u p to this point the earth took the place of them. Plumb every stud you drive, and place them 24 inches apart. Have cellar window frames ready and place them as you come to them. Be sure and make extension for hatchway when building your main wall. For the corn ers use baled hay wire in wads, bending it around the center of wall, and a reinfor ced concrete corner will be the result. Get cobblestones or any stone from the size of a go ose egg to the size of your head, and put them in bottom of wall to depth of 1 foot. Make a m ixing bed, say, about 12 x 36 x 72 inches. One man used an old wooden sink as near wat ertight as possible. Use one water pail of cement to three of fine gravel sand. Put one and one-half pails water in the mixing bed, then add the cement. Be sure and mix water and ceme nt well before using sand. Throw sand in one shovelful at a time. Have one person mixing with a good-sized hoe, while another throws in the sand. Mix well. Have it about the same as thin mortar, so it will l eave the pail easily when pouring into the foundation. Cover the stones and then put in anothe r lot and do the same to height of wall up to within a couple of inches. Do not put stones to full height of wall. To bring wall up to line, mix cement and water together (or one part sa nd and one cement) so it will run, and after wall is hard pour it on top and it will find its own water level and your sills will fit exactly. It is a good plan to have wall thicker at bottom than at top -- perhaps 18 inches at bottom and 12 inches on top. Now for hatchway steps. Put in the stones, as they save cement. Before the cement gets hard, drive in some large spikes, leaving them proj ecting about 2 inches on line of hatchway sills. Your hatchway doors will stay in place if si lls are well-fitted on to spikes. One of the most important things is to be sure of the sand you use. If there is more than 10 per cent loam in the sand, your work will be a failure. A Summer Cool Room Page 7 of 10 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 9b 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices9b.html"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":" A simple method of constructing a cool, outdoor cel lar in localities where the common house cellars are too warm for use during the summe r time, is shown in the accompanying sketch. It is a cellar made under the pump, so that the water pumped by the windmill has a very cooling effect. In places where it is difficul t to obtain ice, it will prove indispensable to the dairyman who keeps a few cows. Another importan t item is the fact that a man does not have to pull up all of the pipes every time that he finds it necessary to repair the pipes and pump. It is constructed of concrete. The top is reinforce d with 1/2-inch steel rods placed 1 foot apart each way and the concrete work is about 6 inc hes thick. The sides are made by using a form, and the stairs are also made of concrete and are reinforced by small steel rods. The cost, including the labor, is about $50. In the wes t and southwest it will also answer the purpose of a storm cave, which is considered a fixt ure on all farms. A Concrete Smokehouse The structure is about 8 x 10 feet and 7 feet high. It will keep the meat inside and thieves out. For a building of this sort 8-inch walls will be thick enough. Excavate to the proper depth below frost, which will be two feet or less, and use a mixture of one part portland cement, three parts sand and six parts gravel or br oken stone. Make the forms of matched boards, although square-e dged boards could be used for this purpose. The forms must be well braced and may be r aised as the work of laying the wall progresses. Space for a doorway must be left and tw o eye-bolts inserted in the concrete for the door to swing on. The door jamb can be molded i n cement if it is desired. An eyebolt for the lock and latch should also be placed in the wal l. The roof will no doubt be of boards or shingles. Th e plates should be placed on the concrete and held to it with bolts properly imbedded. An arc hed concrete roof can be made if desired, in which case it will be necessary to leave suitabl e vents in each end, or build a small flue to allow the smoke to escape. To make the house absolu tely proof against fire a steel or iron door should be used. Laying a Concrete Floor A concrete floor should be level with the top of th e sill, where there is much passing in and out with stock or wagons. There should be about 4 i nches of concrete. If the earth is leveled off and tamped down hard, it would be unnecessary t o put any crushed stone under the concrete in a building where frost or water does no t get underneath. It is generally recommended to put several inches of stones, gravel or cinders on top of the earth, but many Page 8 of 10 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 9b 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices9b.html"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"floors are laid without such a bottom. Partitions f or horse stalls and cattle stanchions can be held in place on a cement floor by putting down iro n belts or pieces of gas pipe when the floor is laid. Let them project 2 or 3 inches above the floor. Making a Concrete Walk The best way is to dig a trench 16 inches deep, put in a foot of loose gravel or stone, leveling it off with fine material. On top of this spread 3 inches of concrete made of one part portland cement, two parts sand and four parts crus hed stone or gravel. On this put a granolithic finish 1 inch thick mixed in the propor tions of 1-2-3. Trowel it down smooth and hard. Joints 1/4 inch thick and filled with san d should be left every 5 feet to prevent walk from cracking Cementing a Cistern Wall In making a surface waterproof, a mixture of about one part portland cement to two of sand will shed water from a roof or wall, but to make a surface perfectly watertight, so that it will keep out standing water, it is better to use neat c ement only, that is, cement with no other material but the water with which it is mixed, and it will cost less to put on a coat 1/4 inch thick of neat cement than one 1 inch thick, one-hal f or two-thirds sand, as the neat cement mixed with plenty of water is waterproof. Special Uses for Cement A sack of portland cement is a very useful thing to have for making quick repairs about the farm. A hole in a drain pipe can be stopped in a fe w minutes with a little cement, mixed with water, thick as putty. A crack in a barrel can be stopped this way. Hardwood floors may be patched and nail holes filled so they will n ot leak. A waterproof floor can be laid over an old board fl oor in a short time. Sweep the old floor clean and dry and nail down all loose boards. Cover with a layer of heavy wire netting, tacking it down occasionally. Over this lay a layer of concrete of one part portland cement, three parts clean sand, mixed with water to a thin paste. Smooth thoroughly, but if it is to be used by stock , brush with an old broom to make it rough, then let it dry thoroughly before using the floor. Gutters may be put in where necessary. Holes in an old shingled roof can be qui ckly stopped by forcing a little cement putty under the shingle where the leak appears. Some special uses to which cement is being put are the making of bee hives, brick for pavement and ordinary foundations, cement shingles for roofing, grain bins in the form of square boxlike and round barrel-like receptacles. T he use of this excellent material for farm structures is only just opening up and it is destin ed to become the most important material for general farm building. A wooden reinforcement in the center of a concrete fence post is worse than useless. It does not make a bond with the concrete, and thus weakens , instead of strengthens, the post. Of course, the same is true of wooden reinforcement of any concrete work.

A supply of pure water is essential. The forms are best made of galvanized iron of any size desired. A convenient size is 16 inches wide, 24 inches long and 12 inches deep inside measure. The sides and ends should be made to taper 1/4 inch, so that the frozen block will drop out easily. The top of the mold should be reinforced wi th wire for the sake of strength and durability. With a dozen or 20 forms one can put up quite a sup ply of ice during the winter. The forms should be set level on joists or boards and placed a few inches apart. Fill them nearly full with pure water and let them freeze, which they wil l do in one or two days and nights in suitable weather. When frozen solid, turn the forms bottom side up and pour a dipper of warm water on them, which will release the cake of ice.

Saving the Seed Corn Small farms Page 1 of 18 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 10a 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices10a.html"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":" Here is a handy device for preserving select ears o f seed corn. It consists of a wide board fastened between two supports nailed to the edges. The board stands upright on one end and may be as long as desired. Drive heavy spikes throu gh it from the opposite side and stick an ear of corn upon each spike. This allows for the pa ssage of air, and the ears can be examined without removing them from the rack. It is much to be preferred to expensive wire racks, as each nail may be numbered and a reco rd kept of the ears in this way. This rack was designed at the Idaho experiment station. Rack for Seed Corn Here is a simple arrangement for keeping choice ear s of seed corn. Take a 2-inch square timber for the upright, and make a so lid base by boring a hole through the two base pieces, then drive the ti mber into it. Drive 4- inch spikes through the upright at intervals of 6 i nches from four sides, and stick the ears of corn on these spikes by thrus ting the same into the butt of the cob. Numbers may be placed above each s pike, so that records can be kept of all of the corn. The corn should be placed on this rack as soon as picked and husked, and may be left there un til planting time if the rack is placed in a dry room where rats and mice ca nnot get at it. A large post strongly mounted on a heavy pedestal may be us ed in a manner similar to the small upright described above. The b igger the post and the larger the number of spikes used, the greater the c apacity of the rack, of course. It is a good plan to make the pedestal heav y and strong in order that it may not be tipped over too easily. The first years of man must make provision for the last. -- Samuel Johnson.

Farmers have had seed corn exposed to a temperature of 30 degrees below zero without injuring its vitality , and have had it ruined at 10 degrees above zero. We would not recommend kiln-drying for the general farmer, as this is only practicable where a grower is in the seed business. A very convenient way is to take four pieces 4 x 4, 6 feet long, set them up in a square, and nail laths on them two and two opposite. Leave a 6-inch space between the laths, s o the corn will have plenty of ventilation. Lay your corn on this to dry, and if thoroughly dry it can lay there all winter.

Have a good, stron g hemp rope attached to the base, passing over the handle end of the lever, so that as it is drawn down and the wagon is lifted it can be hooked in a notch to hold it in position. A Cheap Wheelbarrow The construction of this barrow is very simple. Get a pair of old plow handles, two gate hinges about 1 foot long, and a wheel, which may be found at the junk dealer's. The legs of the wheelbarrow are those of an old chair, braced w ith a piece of iron. These articles in themselves are worthless, but in their combination we create something very useful. A Wheelbarrow Cheap and Strong Here is a picture of a handy, strong wheelbarrow th at any farmer can make on a rainy day. Take a dry-goods box 30 inches long, 24 or 26 inche s wide and 20 inches deep, and two sticks 5-1/2 to 6 feet long and 3 x 3-1/2 inches fo r handles. Nail or screw on crossbrace in front and rear, and pieces with brace as shown for legs. Cut four half circles from inch hardwood board and a notch in center to fit around axle.

A band of hoop iron around the wheel will make it last longer. When it is put toge ther, you have a very substantial wheelbarrow that cost but little. How to Hang a Kettle Using stones for a kettle support seems handiest of tentimes, but let the heat crack one of the stones and tip th e kettle over, as it frequently will, does not tend to impro ve a man's language, let alone the loss sustained. It is much better to make a support such as is presented in the cut. The three uprights, of suitable length to correspond with the size of the kettle, may consist of any good wood. Through t he top of these a hole is bored for the bolt to hold them together, which must be long enough so they will have play to set up easily. All that is necessary then is to suspend tw o chains from the top and letting them extend downward to th e proper distance, attach the ears of the kettle into the hooks on them. When not in use, the device can be folded together and laid away. A Snow Plow No person not owning a snow plow can appreciate how useful one is after every storm. A horse, or if the snow be a heavy one, a span or a y oke of cattle and this simple homemade arrangement, and in less time than is required to t ell it there is a path, and no back-breaking work either. It is only a big V braced so the snow is pushed both ways by it. It must be made of 2-inch planks at least 1 foot wide and not less than 6 feet long. If shorter it wobbles and does not stay on the ground well. To make a good road for teams, chain it to one side of the wood sled and drive up and down. It spreads 2 feet, and will make your farm fr ont look as if somebody of pluck lives there. For foot-paths draw it from a ring at the to p of the front so it will root.

It is made by taking both ends out of a barrel and mounting it up on a box or above a fireplace in the ground. The meat to be smoked is hung from the stic ks laid across the top of the barrel, the fire built underneath and the lid put on. Homemade Heater and Cooker A cheap and economical heater may be of home construction. Make a frame of 2 x 8- inch pine 7 feet long and 27 inches wide. Put a bottom on this of No. 18 galvanized iron, letting it project 1/2 inch on each side and 14 inches at one end for a stovepipe fitting. Spike the frame together and cover the corners with heavy tins to prevent any leaking. Nail the bottom on with two rows of nails. Make a fireplace on the ground of stone and blue cl ay or brick and cement of mortar if preferred, 2 feet wide by 3 feet long and 18 inches high. Pile up dirt 1 foot high and 3 feet wide at the end of the fireplace for a flue, put st one on the earth the length of the galvanized iron, place the tank on this foundation and bank it up with dirt. In cutting a hole for the stovepipe, turn up strips of the galvanized iron fo r a collar, then drive an iron rod into the ground, put on two lengths of stovepipe and wire it fast to the rod. A piece of sheet iron should be set up before the f ireplace to control the draft and keep the fire. Such a heater, on one farm, is located near t he windmill and storage tank and can be filled from either. The water can be heated quickly with cornstalks, straw, cobs or brush. One may boil pumpkins and small potatoes for fatten ing the pigs, and cook ground feed by pouring scalding water on the meal in barrels and c overing with old blankets or carpets.

Take a 2 x 8-inch plank about 3 feet long and an up right of the same material about 20 inches long. Set this upright at an angle of 20 deg rees and use a brace of the same material. The sharp points shown in the cut are 40d wire nail s. Set the wood against these spikes in splitting it. How to Split Wood Wood splits much more readily in the direction up f rom the root of the tree than when the blow of the ax is downward. In other words, to spli t a chunk place it upside down -- contrary to the direction in which it grew. It is m uch easier to split by slabs than to try to cleave through the center. This means to split off pieces near the edge. A Pulling Hammer If you want to make your old claw hammer do more wo rk and do it better and easier, have the handle projecting a lit tle beyond the head. You will find it much more convenient in drawing a nail, as it makes a right angle for pulling the nail without bending it to one side. It takes the place of a block and is always on hand and read y in the right place for immediate use. The handle is simply whittled a little more than usual and driven through to the required distance. Don't drive it through too far, but about as shown at a in the picture. If it sticks out too much, it will be in the way when driving nails. Whittle it off rounding, and give it a finished appearance. Mounting the Farm Anvil To make a solid foundation for an anvil, build a fo rm of boards 14 x 18 inches square at the base, 18 inches high, tapering to 8 x 10 inches at the top. Fill this mold with rich concrete and fix a bolt in the center of the top of it to fa sten the anvil.

In the famous Greeley district of Colo rado, cutting is done by hand. Potatoes are shoveled into a bin or hopper, made of a dry-go ods box raised on legs. The back is made higher than the front, so that potatoes will run do wn to the opening and the bottom is slatted to let out the soil shoveled up with the potatoes. The cutting is simple. An old case knife, a, is fastened to the end of a plank or board, b, in such a way that potatoes can be pushed against the knife and fall from it into the basket beneath. The operator sits on the box to which the board is fastened and can work very rapidly. Another Seed Potato Cutter A wide bench is boxed in on both ends and one side. It is divided into two or three compartments, these being open in the front which c orresponds to the side boxed in. To each of the compartments is attached a sack on hook s, and along one side of the bench in the middle of each compartment and right over the o pening of the sack is fixed, in an upright position, a shoemaker's or common steel tab le knife. Potatoes to be cut for planting are shoveled into t he compartments of the box and in front of each compartment a man takes his position, being se ated on a box or stool for comfort's sake. He seizes the tubers in rapid succession and by pulling them against the blade quickly cuts each one into as many pieces as desired; the p ieces are then dropped into the open sack. It is claimed that by this indirect method of using the knife two fairly good cutters can cut each day all the potatoes ordinarily required for t he use of one planter. How to Test Seed Corn Page 10 of 18 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 10a 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices10a.html"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":" Of the different methods for testing seed corn, the most convenient and satisfactory is a shallow box provided with wet sawdust to furnish th e moisture and a marked cloth on which to lay the kernels. The most convenient box i s one 2 feet square. This will accommodate 100 ears. It is best to make it about 6 inches deep. Fill a sack half full of clean sawdust and soak it for three or four hours in wate r. Then spread this sawdust in the bottom of the test box to the depth of 1 inch. Take a smoo th brick and pack the sawdust down all over the box, making it as level as possible. Be su re to get it packed firmly around the edges and in the corners. Then take a piece of white muslin 25 inches square. Stretch this tight on a table so that it can be marked. Rule off on this cloth with a heavy blue pencil 100 squares 2 inches each way. Beginning at the upper left-hand corner number these squares in rotation from left to right. When the ruling is done, pack the cloth in t he germination box so that it will rest firmly on the sawdust. This can be done by pointing the tacks in the edge of the box downward, and as the tack is driven in it will draw the cloth tight over the sawdust. Of course, there is no advantage testing any ears t hat are of undesirable shape or conformation, therefore the first step is to pick o ut those nearest to the type wanted. Lay these out in rows upon a plank or upon the floor, s eparating each ten ears with a nail driven into the plank or floor. Starting at the left-hand end of the row call the first ear No. 1, then the first ear beyond the first nail will be No. 11, the one beyond the second nail No. 21 and so on. Remove six kernels from ear No. I and place them in square No. 1 in the test box. Put six kernels from ear No. 2 in square No. 2 and so o n through the row. In removing the kernels from the ear take a pocketknife in the righ t hand and the ear in the left. Place the blade at the side of the kernel you wish to remove and pry it gently. The kernel will come out easily and should be caught in the palm of the left hand. First remove a kernel from near the butt of the ear; turn the ear a quarter turn in the hand and remove a kernel from the center; turn the ear another quarter turn and remov e a kernel from near the tip; another quarter turn and remove a second kernel from near t he butt; another quarter and remove the second kernel from the center; another quarter turn and remove a second kernel from the tip. This makes six kernels from six different rows and representing the butt, middle and tip. In placing the kernels in the box it will be found of advantage to point the tips all in the same direction, and also to lay the kernels with th e germ uppermost. If the kernels are laid in the squares promiscuously, they may be thrown ou t of their places when the sprouts begin to grow. When the kernels are all in place, t ake a second piece of white cloth fully 24 inches square, moisten it and lay it carefully over the kernels. This will hold them in place Page 11 of 18 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 10a 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices10a.html"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"while the top layer of sawdust is being put on. Tak e a third piece of cloth about 48 x 30 inches and lay it over the box so that the edges la p about equally. Then in this cloth put another inch of wet sawdust and pack it down firmly , especially around the edges. When this is done turn the edges of the cloth over the s awdust to keep it from drying out too rapidly and place the test box where it will not be subjected to cold below a living-room temperature. Reading the Results After seven days carefully roll back the cloth cont aining the top layer of sawdust and lift the second cloth off the kernels. This must be done wit h care, because sometimes the sprouts grow through the cloth and the kernels will cling t o it. Observe the results in square No. 1. If all six of the kernels have vigorous sprouts, from 3/4 to 2 inches long, you can be sure that ear No. 1 is thoroughly good. If in square No. 2 only two of the kernels have sprouted, you may know that ear No. 2 will make much better hog feed than seed corn. As soon as you have determined that ear No. 2 is really bad, pull it out from the row about half its length, leaving the oth er ears in place. After you have gone through the whole line, you may then go back and pi ck out the bad ears and discard them. Of course, we would all prefer to use only those ea rs that gave a perfect germination, and if one has enough, that is the thing to do. But experi ence has taught that it is quite safe to use an ear, four of whose kernels grow strong sprouts. Or, if seed corn is scarce, one should not hesitate to use one that gave three strong sprouts and two weaker ones. This testing may be done at any time after the ears are dry. It is generally more convenient to do it in winter, when there is not much outside work to be done. The box may be set behind the stove or any other convenient place, whe re it is sufficiently warm; in many cases, where there is an attic above the kitchen th at room is a sufficiently warm place for testing. Some put sand in an ordinary dinner plate, flood wi th water, and then drain the excess water off, place the seed on top of the sand, and cover w ith another dinner plate, Others use a saucer made of porous clay. The seeds are placed in this, the saucer set in a pan of water, and the pan covered. These methods may be used for other grains as well as corn. In case of sowing grasses, alfalfa or wheat, it is often of great advantage to test the seed. Every man has two educations -- that which is given to him and the other, that which he gives to himself. Of the two kinds, the latter is b y far the most valuable. Indeed, all that is most worthy in a man he must work out and conquer f or himself. It is that that constitutes our real and best nourishment. What we are merely t aught, seldom nourishes the mind like that which we teach our selves. -- Richter. Killing Insects in Grain If one has not time to make a substantial box for f umigation of seed grain for insect destruction, barrels may be utilized for the purpos e. Get two tight, strong barrels, such as coal oil barrels, and make water tight. Put in the seed to be fumigated, cover with a blanket and close-fitting cover. Before covering pour carbo n bisulphide, which is explosive, over the grain, at the rate of 3 to 4 ounces for 5 bushe ls of grain. If it is not desirable to pour this poison on grain, set a saucer on it, and pour the p oison in the saucer.

The sketch shows a rope stretched over the top of a load of hay or straw. The upright pin is worked down into the load and the other twisted in the rope and turned around the upright until the load is tightly bound. Then a small rope that is kept tied in end of the horizontal pin is tied to the binding rope a nd the pressure is held. Each pin is 3-1/2 feet long. One is sharpened and the other has a 1/2 -inch hole bored through one end. Old fork handles are just the thing to make them of. On e pin only may be made and a fork used to bind in the manner shown after the load is on. Nothing is impossible to industry. -- Periander. Combined Drag and Harrow This road drag is all right. The front piece consis ts of a 4 x 4 oak strip, b , 10 feet long, through which are driven ordinary harrow teeth abou t 3 inches apart. This is attached to the rear piece, a, which is a 2 x 6 oak timber 10 feet long faced with 3 inches of 1/4-inch metal on the bottom, e, which projects 1 inch. These pieces are kept apart by wooden blocks, d, upon the bolts, f , and by the top strips, c, each 2 x 6. This makes a fine level road, as it harrows it and scrapes it at the same time.

The various sailors' knots may often be used to great advantage. To sling a plank for painting or other purposes make a bight of rope as shown in Figure 1, bringing the rope entirely around the plank, so as to prevent its turning and throwing the workman down. One-half to 3/4-inch rope is usually sufficient for all practical purposes. A hemp rope is more generally used and stands wear better than other kinds. A useful way to sling a can or pail from the end of a rope is shown in Figure 2. Prepared in this way the vessel is secure so long as the rope is not slipped off from the bottom. Secure the knot firmly at the top to allow no slipping and so that the pail may not become lopsided. Scaffolding may often be erected by tying poles tog ether as shown in Figure 3. This sort of lashing will not slip if made tight. In many cases a chain may be used as shown in Figure 4, in which case the weight should be on the side of t he upright where the chain is lowest. All of these lashings must be drawn very tight so as no t to allow any play, which may result disastrously. An excellent hitch knot is shown in Figure 5, readi ly made, easily loosened and valuable for many purposes on the farm. This knot is readily unt ied by slackening up the drawing strand. It does not become tight and hard as many ordinary knots after heavy usage. In many cases where heavy hooks are used they are l iable to come unfastened unless a cord is affixed, as shown in Figure 6. A few turns of he avy twine or light wire in the middle will frequently prevent any loosening of the chain. Hundreds of farmers are today making profitable use of automobiles, although their first appearance upon country roads caused only fear and anger.

The loose end of the rope is allowed to hang free or may be tied with a slip knot to the drawing strand. Tying Some Useful Knots A sailor judges knots for their holding qualities a nd also their ability to be quickly unfastened, without regard to the strain they have been subjected to. A knot's main office is to hold, without working loose or slipping, yet the y do occasionally fail absolutely to accomplish this, when made by inexperienced hands. The accompanying diagrams show some of the simpler knots that may be of everyday u se. In these, the mode of formation can be readily discerned, because the rope's position i s shown before tightening. The overhand knot, Figure 1, is probably the simplest of all. It is used only for making a knot at the end of a rope to keep it from fraying or to prevent anothe r knot from slipping. If a slight change in formation is made, as in Figure 5, it develops into a slip knot or, as it is sometimes called, a single sling, and its purposes are obvious. A doubl e sling is represented in Figure 6, and though it is slightly more complicated, it is consi derably more useful for any purpose where a rope is to be attached to a bar or beam and stand a steady strain. Probably for convenience and emergencies no knots e qual the bow-line, Figure 7, because it will not slip or give, no matter how great the tens ion; in fact, the rope itself is no stronger, and the instant the strain ceases it can be untied as easily as a bow. When the end of a rope is to be secured, the two half-hitches or clove hit ch, Figures 2 and 3, are of great importance, for either of these bends can be attach ed instantly to almost anything, and their holding powers are exceeded by none. The square kno t, Figure 4, can be used for infinite purposes, from reefing a sail to tying a bundle, th e advantage being, if made properly, of resisting any separating strain on either cord, and yet can be untied immediately by pulling one of the short ends. One of the best and safest slip knots is shown in F igure 9, made with the overhand at the end, which, until loosened by the hand, maintains i ts grip. When a rope requires shortening temporarily the sheep shank, Figure 8, affords a me ans of so doing. This knot can be applied to any part of the rope without reducing it s strength of rectilineal tension.

About 10 inches from the other end, boards about 2 feet long and 8 inches wi de are nailed as shown at c, c, in figure. Pieces c, c, are then cut in circular form so as to fit the outs ide of a barrel.

These are then riveted together so as to make hinge s as shown at d, d. The tire need be only long enough to fasten securel y to the handle pieces. Of course, the blacksmith should drill holes in them, that they may be securely riveted. To use this device, drop it over the barrel.

Carrying Butter to Town A refrigerator that one farmer uses in which he tak es butter to town nine miles away in hot weather is made thus: Get two clean, tight boxes of some odorless wood, one 12 x 15 x 13 inches deep, and the other 9 x 12 x 10 inches deep. Slip one inside the other with a notched block in each corner to hold the inside box in plac e. Fasten the covers together so as to leave an air space of about 1 inch between them all around. The inner box will hold 20 pounds of butter nicely. It will carry butter solid in wagon all day in 9O-degree weather. To Sharpen Scissors Do you know that you can sharpen scissors, and easi ly, by passing the blades over glass jars? Take a bottle or jar, make believe you are tr ying to cut it (have one blade in and the other outside of the top of the bottle) and then al low the scissors to glide off the hard surface naturally, just as if you were trying to cu t the glass. Use firm but not too hard pressure, and repeat the operation several times. How to Paper a Room If a room has been papered several times, tear off all the loose parts you can and with a sponge and water loosen what remains on the walls, removing as much as possible, so as to have a smooth, even surface. If the room has never been papered, first go over it and fill all large cracks and holes with a paste made of whiting and water, or plaster of paris and water. When using the latter, mix only a little at a time, have it rather thin, and use quickly. Then, give the room a coat of sizing, which is made of co mmon glue, three or four handfuls dissolved in a pail of boiling water. The sizing is applied with a large brush and should be allowed to dry overnight. Choose Judiciously For very sunny rooms, select cool-looking papers such as blues, greens and browns in various shades, while for dark rooms pinks, Page 2 of 11 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 10b 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices10b.html"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"reds, terra cottas and yellows are best. When selecting papers, pay careful attention to the colo r scheme of your room, and don't have an inharmonious mixture, which will offend good taste. Small, plain patterns are the most economical, and the easiest to match. The cheap, tr ashy papers, costing only a few cents a roll, are not worth the trouble of putting up. Gold paper is not to be recommended for wear. No borders should be used for rooms having a low ce iling. For such, a striped paper of pretty design running right up to the ceiling is be st. The ceiling may be papered in a plain or very small-patterned design, to harmonize with the side walls, or treated with several coats of tinted kalsomine or paint. A picture molding of appropriate color is used to finish the side walls, being placed scarcely 1 inch from the ceilin g. The ceiling whether papered, painted or kalsomined, should be done first. It is a very d ifficult matter to paper the ceiling, and, unless you can have help, it would be better not to attempt it. Plain tints in paint or kalsomine are always pretty and in good taste. If, however, you want to risk papering the ceiling yourself, get some handy body to help you. Paste and Tools The paste is made by simply boiling flour and water together, and adding a very little alum, salt and glue -- about a tablespoon of each to a po und of flour. It should be of a consistency thick enough to apply easily, and not so thin that it will run. Provide yourself with a good-sized paste brush, ano ther one (a whitewash brush will do) to use dry over the paper, sharp scissors and a knife, plenty of clean rags, two barrels, two long, smooth, clean boards, each about 10 inches wi de, and a step-ladder. Make a long table by placing the two barrels about 8 or 9 feet apart and on top of these the boards. Trimming and Cutting The first thing to do is to cut the necessary numbe r of strips of paper long enough to allow for waste in matching, and lay them all face downwa rd on the \"operating\" table, one on top of the other. Next spread the paste evenly over the top or first strip of paper, being very sure to have the edges well pasted. Then turn top and bo ttom parts down, bringing pasted sides together, so that they meet, and none of the paste part is exposed, and carefully trim off edge on one side, with large, sharp scissors. Lift up the part thus trimmed and folded, and mount the ladder, which should previously have been placed convenient to the place where you intend to begin operations -- the largest wall space is best, next to a door or window. Hanging the Paper Now take hold of the top end which was doubled over (it will open and hang by its own weight) and adjust to its proper place on the wall. Then, with a large clean rag in your hand, rub downward, never up or sideways, and take great care to keep the edge straight. If you find that you didn't start straight from the top, l oosen paper and do it over again. A \"straight eye\" is needed to do the work neatly. Don't rub too hard and always rub downward, doing a little part at a time, and lifting paper occasional ly, so that no air bubbles are left under it. When the upper part is done, dismount from ladder, undo the folded part at the bottom of the width, and proceed in the same manner to adjust to the wall. When you are sure it is on straight and smooth, trim with a sharp knife along the baseboard. Then give the strip another smoothing by going all over it again with a dry, clean brush. Proceed in this way until all the full length parts are covered, and th en match in the small spaces over and below windows and doors. All the matching must be done wi th great care.

A narrow wooden molding is used to finish the top of the wainscoting, and in that case the work of papering the side walls is so much easi er, the lengths being short. The Farm Blacksmith Shop A blacksmith shop is of immense practical value on a farm. To those who have one it is almost as essential as livestock, farm tools and cr ops. One does not need to be a professional blacksmith. The elementary practice in welding, upsetting and tempering is easily learned with a little practice. Nor is it ne cessary to have many tools. An entire equipment may cost but a few dollars. An old railroad rail will do for an anvil. But afte r getting the real article one is better satisfied and can do the work with greater ease. Th e forge should be obtained at the start. With it almost anyone can heat any small iron to we lding point with as much ease as a regular blacksmith. In the equipment of an Ohio farmer are a pair of to ngs that he made himself, two other tongs and a large pair of pinchers picked up in a j unk shop. He got the hammer and sledge from a hired man who had worked in a car shop. The anvil and vise also came from the junk shop, and both were in good repair. These cost $8, the hammer and sledge, $1.15, and an old, second-hand forge, $1.80. Not a large outlay t o be sure, but a wise expenditure. If purchased at first hand the cost would be greater, but cheap at any price when you consider what you can do in the way of making and repairing with such a list of blacksmith tools. In addition to the above list this man, Frank Ruhle n, has chisels, pinchers, fullers and other small tools, all of which he has made out of old pi eces of steel taken from old worn-out machines. By figuring and planning just a little, a ny farmer can make the greater part of his own tools and at a very small cost for materials an d labor. Why the Shop Pays Mr. Ruhlen says: My shop was not started to replace the town blacksmith shop; and it will never do so. But it does serve for repair work, and it saves many trips to town. It is helpful in other ways, also. Last winter a sudden ice spell came on, so severe that I could not get the horses out to the field to feed the flock. Only one thing was possible: to have sharpened shoes put on the horses. But it was a disagreeable trip ahead to walk and lead the horses to town; so I decided to do the work myself. I had nev er set a shoe myself, but that trip before me quickly decided. The horses were brought into th e shop, the old shoes pulled off and sharpened, and within an hour the feeding was done. Had I gone to town for the work it would have required time going and coming, and then , maybe a long wait ahead for my turn at the shop. Last year I sharpened the shoes on the corn planter , and both cultivators, six shovels each. We wore out a steel point or shear, and never had i t to shop but once, and then it was to get a new nose or point. I do not try to put steel poin ts on anything, as it is too particular work for anyone who just picks tools up when something b reaks. A sharp harrow is a luxury on most farms, because the average smith does not draw the teeth out enough, and they are dull in a few days. And I do not believe the average smith can harden t he farm tools as good as a farmer who Page 4 of 11 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 10b 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices10b.html"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"has had some experience in tempering, as the farmer is the one who works with the tools, and soon learns when they are too hard or not hard enough. I sharpened my smoothing harrow last year before we commenced on our corn cr op of 64 acres, used it on all the land, on some more than once, and my harrow is sharper no w than my neighbor's, who paid $1.50 at the shop for the same work. We never use a dull mattock or pick now as we did before we had a forge. Welding chains, making chain hooks, open rings, clevises, are all easy to do on rainy days. I could not tell all the different u ses I make of my shop. Blacksmithing Not Hired Man's Work I do the work in the shop myself, finding other cho res for hired men. You cannot afford to break them in, for the reason that they may soon le ave and all the teaching and trouble would be for nothing. By doing the work myself, I h ave learned a little more each year, have acquired the knack of it, and really enjoy doi ng what is to be done. Had we had a shop when I was a boy all of the repair work could have been done by the boys, and I would at the same time have had splendid training for my own needs now. My experience is all in favor of the shop on the fa rm. It pays well. Get the forge first, and then gradually add other tools as you can. I used a claw hammer for some time before getting a smith's hammer. I did not equip my shop a ll at once. Start in a small way, build up gradually, learn slowly, and the shop will develop itself. Get a shop, and you will believe in it because of its help to you. Horseshoe Lever A handy lever for prying up boxes or barrels may be made by nailing an old horseshoe on the end of a 2 x 4, letting the ends of the horsesh oe extend about an inch or two beyond the end of the timber. A more finished device may be co nstructed by cutting the upper part of the lever down to the form of a rounded handle. A h orseshoe should be selected with fairly long and well-sharpened heel calks. How to Paint Tin Roofs Remove all rosin and other loose substances from se ams and have roof clean. Paint immediately after laying is finished; do not allow the tin to rust -- you coat the base plate with tin and lead to prevent rust, and paint the fi nished goods to prevent oxidation of the coating. Use only the best red or brown oxide of ir on, mixed with pure linseed oil all raw, or half raw and half boiled. Use litharge only as a dr ier. Litharge makes paint adhere hard to coating, so that when thoroughly dry you cannot scr ape it off. Don't use any turpentine or patent driers. Apply all paint with hand brushes and rub in well. This is very important. Don't put paint on thick -- one coat that covers well, and is thorough ly rubbed in, is better than three put on thick. Let roof stand two weeks to a month before a pplying second coat. Six months or so Page 5 of 11 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 10b 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices10b.html"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"after applying second coat put on a third coat.

By following these directions you will have a roof that will last many years. Preserving Wood Creosote, or sulphate of copper or iron, are effect ive for preserving wood. There are objections, however, to their use for floorings or ornamental woodwork. Creosote leaves a permanent, disagreeable smell. The sulphates discol or the wood. Borax is excellent for keeping wood from decay. The preparation of it is s imple, and consists in immersing the wood in a saturated solution of borax, which is the n heated to 212 degrees Fahrenheit. The wood is left for 10 or 12 hours, the time depending upon the density and size of the pieces of wood. When taken out, the wood is stacked until dry, then reimmersed in a weaker solution of the borax for a brief time, dried again , and are then ready for use. Boards thus prepared are practically indestructible from rot, a nd are nearly incombustible. Another preservative is a compound of one part sili cate of potassa and three of pure water -- the wood to remain in the solution 24 hours, then d ried for several days, then soaked and dried a second time and afterward painted twice wit h a mixture of one part water-cement and four of the first-mentioned mixture. Thus prepa red, it will not decay in the ground, and will be incombustible out of it. Another process for preventing decay of wood is by use of a paint which possesses the advantages of being impervious to water. It is comp osed of 50 parts of tar, 500 parts of fine white sand, 4 parts of linseed oil, 1 part of the r ed oxide of copper in its native state, and 1 part of sulphuric acid. The tar, sand and oil shoul d be first heated in an iron kettle; the oxide and acid are then added very carefully. The mass is thoroughly mixed and applied while hot. When dry, this paint is as hard as stone. Decay in wood may be prevented by the following met hod: Take 20 parts of resin, 46 parts of finely powdered chalk, some hard sand, and a lit tle linseed oil and sulphuric acid; mix and boil for a short time. If this is applied while hot, it forms a kind of varnish, thereby preserving the wood. To Preserve Shingles Following is an effective method to prevent the dec ay of shingles: Take a potash kettle or large tub and put into it one barrel of lye of wood ashes, 5 pounds of white vitriol, 5 pounds of alum, and as much salt as will dissolve in the m ixture. Make the preparation quite warm, and put as many shingles in it as can be convenient ly wet at once. Stir them up with a fork, and, when well soaked, take them out and put in mor e, renewing the preservative solution when necessary. Then lay the shingles in the usual manner. After they are laid, take more of the preservative, put lime enough into it to make whitewash, and, if any coloring is desirable, add o cher, Spanish brown, lampblack, or other color, and apply to the roof with a brush or an old broom. This wash may be renewed from time to time. Salt and lye are excellent preservatives of wood. L each tubs, troughs and other articles used in the manufacture of potash never rot. They become saturated with the alkali, turn yellowish inside and remain impervious to the weath er.

Satura te the woodwork with a very delicate solution of silicate of potash as nearly neutral as possible, and when this has dried, apply one or two coats of a stronger solution. Another method is simply to soak the wood with a co ncentrated solution of rock salt. Water-glass will act as well, but it is expensive. The salt also renders the wood proof against dry rot and the ravages of insects. Still another m ethod is to immerse the wood in a saturated solution of borax, heat being gradually a pplied until the solution reaches 212 degrees Fahrenheit. It is then left for 10 or 12 ho urs, according to the nature and size of the wood. Fireproof Wash for Shingles A preparation composed of lime, salt and fine sand or wood ashes, put on like whitewash, renders the roof 50 per cent more secure against ta king fire from falling cinders, in case of fire in the vicinity. It pays the expense a hundred fold in its preserving influence against the effects of the weather. The older and more weather- beaten the shingles, the more benefit derived. Such shingles generally become more or les s warped, rough and cracked; the application of the wash, by wetting the upper surfa ce, restores them at once to their original form, thereby closing up the space between the shin gles, and the lime and sand, by filling up the cracks and pores in the shingle itself, prev ents warping. Petrified Wood Mix equal parts of gem salt, rock alum, white vineg ar, chalk and Peebles' powder. After the mixture becomes quiet, put into it any wood or poro us substance, and the latter becomes like stone. How to Season Wood Boiling small pieces of non-resinous wood will seas on them in four or five hours -- the process taking the sap out of the wood, which shrin ks nearly one-tenth in the operation. Trees felled in full leaf in June or July, and allo wed to lie until every leaf has fallen, will then be nearly dry, as the leaves will not drop off themselves until they have drawn up and exhausted all the sap of the tree. The time require d is from a month to six weeks, according to the dryness of the weather. Bleaching Wood Sometimes it is more feasible to bleach a small par t of a wood surface, especially in repairing, than to darken a larger portion of the w ork. This can be done by brushing over the wood a solution composed of 1 ounce oxalic acid in a pint of water, letting it remain a few minutes and then wiping dry. The operation may be r epeated if necessary. A few drops of nitric ether, or a quarter of an ounce of tartaric acid, will assist the operation; or a hot solution of tartaric acid may be used alone. Lemon juice will also whiten most woods. Cut the lemon in half and rub the cut face upon the woo d. When the bleaching has been done and the wood is dr y, give a thin coat of shellac or French polish, as the light and air acting upon the bare w ood will bring back the original color.

This whitens, but it also some what deadens or obscures the grain and is, therefore, not so good as the bleaching method. Wood Polish Rub evenly over the wood a piece of pumice stone an d water until the rising of the grain is cut down; then take powdered tripoli and boiled lin seed oil and polish to a bright surface. Furniture Polish Take equal parts of sweet oil and vinegar, mix, add a pint of gum arabic finely powdered. This will make furniture look almost as good as new and can be easily applied, as it requires no rubbing. The bottle should be shaken, and the po lish poured on a rag and applied to the furniture. Size Stains By the aid of glue in the solution, the colors are fixed in size stains. They are employed for the purpose of giving a color to cheap work in soft woods, such as chairs, bedsteads and common tables and ordinary bookcases. The colors us ually wanted are walnut, mahogany, cherry color, oak and even a rosewood. For Mahogany -- Dissolve 1 pound of glue in a gallon of water, and stir in 1/2 pound Venetian red, and 1/4 pound chrome yellow, or yellow ocher. Darken with t he red and lighten with yellow, as desired. If the Venetian re d does not give a sufficiently dark look put in a pinch of lampblack. Apply hot. For Rosewood -- Same as mahogany, omitting the yellow, and usin g 3/4 pound Venetian red (or more) instead of 1/2 pound. Give one coat of this and then add lampblack , one pinch, or more, to the color; with the latter put i n the figure or dark parts of the rosewood. For Oak -- In a gallon of glue size (as above) put 3/4 pou nd powdered burnt umber. Lighten with yellow (chrome or ocher), if need be. Hot. Dark Wood Stain White woods may be given the appearance of walnut b y painting or sponging them with a concentrated warm solution of permanganate of potas sa. Some kinds of wood become stained rapidly, while others require more time. Th e permanganate is decomposed by the woody fiber; brown peroxide of manganese is deposit ed, which afterward may be removed by washing with water. The wood, when dry, may be v arnished, and will be found to resemble very closely the natural dark woods. Red Stain for Wood Boil chopped Brazil wood thoroughly in water, strai n it through a cloth. Then give the wood two or three coats, till it is the shade wanted. If a deep red is desired, boil the wood in water in which is dissolved alum and quicklime. When the last coat is dry, burnish it with the burnisher and then varnish.

It is re ady for use. Cement for Metal and Glass Take 2 ounces of a thick solution of glue, and mix it with 1 ounce of linseed-oil varnish, and half an ounce of pure turpentine; the whole is then boiled together in a close vessel. The two bodies should be clamped and held together for about two days after they are united to allow the cement to become dry. The clamps may then be removed. Cement for Broken China Stir plaster of paris into a thick solution of gum arabic till it becomes a viscous paste. Apply it with a brush to the fractured edges, and draw th e parts closely together. Cement for Crockery and Glass Take 4 pounds of white glue, 1-1/2 pounds of dry wh ite lead, 1/2 pound of isinglass, 1 gallon of soft water, 1 quart of alcohol, and 1/2 p int of white varnish. Dissolve the glue and isinglass in the water by gentle heat if preferred, stir in the lead, put the alcohol in the varnish and mix the whole together. Mending Glassware Broken dishes and glassware may be easily mended as follows: Fit the pieces in their proper places and tie a string around the vessel to keep t he parts from slipping out. Then boil the entire dish for two or three hours in sweet milk. T his will firmly glue the vessel together and it will last for years with proper care. Armenian Cement This will strongly unite pieces of glass and china, and even polished steel, and may be applied to a variety of useful purposes. Dissolve f ive or six bits of gum mastic, each the size of a large pea, in as much rectified spirits of win e as will suffice to render it liquid; and, in another vessel, dissolve as much isinglass, previou sly a little softened in water (though none of the water must be used), in French brandy or goo d rum, as will make a two-ounce vial of very strong glue, adding two small bits of gum galb anum of ammoniacum, which must be rubbed or ground till they are dissolved. Then mix the whole with a sufficient heat. Keep the glue in a vial closely stopped, and when it is to be used set the vial in boiling water. Japanese Cement Thoroughly mix the best powdered rice with a little cold water, then gradually add boiling water until a proper consistence is acquired, being particularly careful to keep it well stirred all the time; lastly it must be boiled for one minu te in a clean saucepan or earthen pipkin. This glue is white, almost transparent, for which r eason it is well adapted for fancy paper work, which requires a strong and colorless cement.

Mix thoroughly, and lay on with a painter's brush, firs t a thin coat, and then a thick one. This composition is not only cheap, but it strongly resi sts fire. Fire Kindlers Take 1 quart of tar and 3 pounds of resin, melt the m, bring to a cooling temperature, mix with as much sawdust, with a little charcoal added, as can be worked in; spread out while hot upon a board, when cold break up into lumps of the size of a large hickory nut, and you have, at a small expense, kindling material enough for one year. They will easily ignite from a match and burn with a strong blaze, long enough t o start any wood that is fit to burn. Mending Pipes with Water On Many farmers have had trouble in repairing pipes wh ere the water could not be shut off conveniently. A lead pipe which has been cut off ac cidentally in making an excavation, for instance, may be repaired by the following plan: Th e two ends of the pipe are plugged, and then a small pile of broken ice and salt are placed around them; in five minutes the water in the pipe will be frozen, the plugs removed, a short piece of pipe may then be in serted and perfectly soldered. In five minutes the ice in the pipes may be thawed and the water set to flowing freely again. To Join Water Pipes Water pipes may be united by using a preparation ma de by combining four parts of good portland cement and one part of unslaked lime mixed together in small portions in a stout mortar, adding enough water to permit it to be redu ced to a soft paste. Welding Metals Welding together two pieces of metal of any kind ca n be accomplished only when the surfaces to be joined are equally heated, and both surfaces must be brought to such a temperature that the particles will form a perfect continuity between the pieces united. This embraces the entire theory of welding, soldering or brazing metallic substances of any kind. In addition, however, to the equal and adequate hea ting of the surfaces to be united, every particle of coal dust, cinders or scales of oxide m ust be removed, so as to present two perfectly clean surfaces at the very moment when th e union is to be effected. The piece of metal that would fuse at the lower tem perature must be the guide, when bringing the surfaces of conjunction up to the prop er heat. If, for example, two pieces of wrought iron are to be welded, the part that will m elt at the lower temperature must be brought just to a welding heat, and the surface of the other piece must be heated quite as hot, or a trifle hotter than the first piece. Then, if the surfaces are clean when the parts are brought together, the union will be satisfactory. T he degree of heat aimed at must be, not to produce a fluid, but simply to bring the metal into a condition between the fluid and plastic. Grinding Tools All steel is composed of individual fibers running lengthways in the bar and held firmly together by cohesion. In almost all farm implements of the cutting kind the steel portion which forms the edge, if from a section of a bar, i s welded to the bar lengthwise, so that it is the side of the bundle of fibers hammered and groun d down that forms the edge. So, by Page 10 of 11 Handy Farm Devices - Cobleigh - chapter 10b 11/9/2008 http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/device/dev ices10b.html"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"holding on the grindstone all edge-tools, as axes, scythes and knives of strawcutters, in such a manner that the action of the stone is at right a ngles with the edge, or, this is to say, by holding the edge of the tools square across the sto ne, the direction of the fibers will be changed, so as to present the ends instead of the s ide as a cutting edge. By grinding in this manner a finer, smoother edge is set, the tool is g round in less time, holds an edge a great deal longer, and is far less liable to nick out and to break. Plane irons should be ground to a level of about 35 degrees -- chisels and gouges to 30. Turning chisels may sometimes run in an angle of 45 . Molding tools, such as are used for ivory and for very hard wood, are made at from 50 t o 60 degrees. Tools for working iron and steel are beveled at an inclination to the edge of from 60 to 70 degrees, and for cutting gun and similar metal range from 80 to 90. 1. Workshop and Tools 2.
