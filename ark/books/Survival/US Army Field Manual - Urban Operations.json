To this end, FM 3-06 discusses m ajor Arm y opera- tions in an urban environm ent. This envi ronment, consisting of complex terrain, a concentrated population, and an infrastr ucture of system s, is an operational environm ent in which Arm y forces will oper ate. In the future, it m ay be the pre- dom inant operational environm ent. Each urban operation will be distinct from any other—any other urban operation as we ll as sim ilar types of operations in other environm ents. Each operation will di ffer because of the m ultitude of com bi- nations presented by the threat, the urban area itself, the major operation of which it may be part (or the focus), and th e fluidity of societal and geo-political considerations. Therefore, there will always exist an innate tension between Arm y doctrine, the actual context of the urban operation, and future realities. Com manders are responsible to strike the proper balance between preparing for future challenges and m aintaining the capability to respond to current threats. PURPOSE This m anual provides the analytical tool s for evaluating an urban operation to determ ine if the operation is necessary for overall mission success. It also pro- vides the means to understanding and determining the impacts of the urban environm ent on m ilitary operations an d provides inform ation on managing, taking advantage of, and m itigating the effects of those im pacts as appropriate. As such, this manual demonstrates how to apply the doctrinal principles in FM 3-0 to this unique environment. SCOPE Chapter 1 introduces theoretical and histor ical perspectives of urban operations that serve as the underlying basis for the rest of the manual. Chapter 2 discusses the characteristics of urban centers and populations as well as their impact on operations. It is unlikely that Arm y fo rces will ever operate in a benign urban environm ent; therefore, Chapter 3 discusses the varied nature of potential urban threats. An understanding of the com plexities of the urban environm ent and the nature of the enem y is essential to so und decisionmaking. Chapters 4 and 5 dis- cuss the potential costs of urban operations as well as the effects on each battle- field operating system that the com mander and his staff consider early in their planning. These chapters also outline an urban operational framework and spe- cific urban considerations that create th e foundations necessary for successfully applying operational doctrine to an urban environment. The second half of the manual (Chapters 6 – 9) discusses how urban operations are conducted and resourced. Urban oper ations include major offensive and de- fensive operations in urban environm ents as well as stability operations and sup- port operations ranging from peace op erations and combatting terrorism to domestic support operations and foreig n humanitarian assistance. For the dif- ferent types of operations—offense, defe nse, stability, and support—the purpose, characteristics, organization, and consid erations are discussed.

APPLICABILITY This manual is intended for commanders and their staffs at the brigade through corps level. It addresses the range of operations (both violent and nonviolent) throughout the spectrum of conflict th at Arm y units will execute in urban settings. However, users should also consult JP 3-06 for specific joint inform ation. Additionally, users should be fam iliar with FM 3-06.11, TC 90-1, and urban operations chapters, appendices , or sections found in other infantry, arm or, com bined arm s, and proponent field m anuals for the tactics, techniques, and pro cedure s (TTP) and appro priate pro ponent info rmatio n ne cessary to conduct tactical urban operations at the brigade level and below. ADMINISTRATIVE INSTRUCTIONS Chapter 2 defines “city” according to a the population size. However, in historical vignettes and accounts, the term “city” is applied in its com mon usage without specific regard to size to m aintain confor mity with most other historical reports. In this manual, the term “threat” is applied broadly to include an enem y force (conventional or unconventional), an arm ed belligerent in a peace operation, an- tagonistic or unfriendly elem ents of the civilian population, or som e other hazar- dous condition in the urban environment that negatively influences mission ac- complishment. The term “hostile” is used as a subset of the threat and denotes a particular elem ent of the urban population (individual, group, or organization) or one or m ore opposing arm ed factions in a peacekeeping operation. Both an enem y and a hostile have the intent to exploit Arm y vulnerabilities and negatively affect the urban operation. A hostile, howeve r, is not engaging Arm y forces in protracted com bat operations. The term m ilitary operations on urban terrain (MOUT) is replaced by urban operations (UO). MOUT is an acronym from FM 90-10 Military Operations on Urban Terrain that is supe rse ded by this manual. Otherwise, the glossary lists most terms used in FM 3-06 that have joint or Army definitions. Where Arm y and j oint definitions are different, (Arm y) follows the term . Definitions for which F M 3-06 is the proponent manual (the authority) are marked with an asterisk ( * ). The proponent or am plifying m anual for other term s is listed in parenthese s after the definition. The m anual attem pts to incorporate historical vignettes into each chapter where the account supports the doctrinal line of reasoning. T wo historical vignettes, however, were included as appendices (A and C) because of their longer lengths.

Self-aware leaders under- stand their operational environment, can assess their own capabilities, determine their own strengths and weaknesses, and actively learn to overcome their weaknesses. Adaptive leaders must first be self-aware—then have the additional ability to recognize change in their operating environment, identify those changes, and learn how to adapt to succeed in their new environment. FM 1 Given the prevalence of large cities throughout the world, Army forces, division size and larger, will likely be required to conduct operations in and around large urban areas. These op erations will be in support of a joint force commander (JFC) conducti ng military operations pursuant to United States (US) national security policy. This manual is designed to facilitate the planning and conduct of the full range and spectrum of land operations in a complex urban environment. Each urban environment and urban operation is unique; prescribing specific doctrinal “solutions” for situations is impossible. Instead, this manual provides a framework to commanders and their staffs for understanding the urban environment, for analyzing and deciding whether urban operations (UO) are necessary or feasible, and for applying operatio nal doctrine to this complex environ- ment. It also provides historical vi gnettes to help develop a refined analy- tical perspective and some planning po ints and tactics and techniques to assist in preparing for and conducti ng UO. Together, this information provides a foundation for approaching major UO, which, combined with other joint and Army doctrine, will help commanders and their staffs learn to adapt and succeed in this challenging environment.

The world is in a period of massi ve urbanization. A trend of m igration from rural to urban areas is occurring throughout the globe. This trend is especially evident in developing nati ons. Com bined with the exponential growth of the global population in the last quarter century, this migration has created m assive urban areas that hold the centers of population, governm ent, and econom ics in their resp ective regions. In Western Europe, for exam ple, over 50 percent of the land area is urbanized. Just over 30 years ago, only three urban areas in Asia contained at least eight m illion people. By 2015, estimates show that Asia will have 17 urban areas over ten million, and three of those will top 20 m illion residents. Alm ost half of today’s population resides in urban areas. Tren ds also indicate that less developed nations have more centralized societ ies in a few urban areas. Developed nations spread their centralized societ ies in several urban areas. In m any cases, rapid urbanization has overburd ened already weak infrastructures, scarce resources, and a fragile econom ic base. Given the global population, Arm y forces will likely conduct operations in and around urban areas— not as a matter of fate but as a deliberate choice linked to national objectives and strategy and at a time, place, and method of the commander’s choosing . Army Urban Operations Army forces conduct UO either as one co mponent of a larger operation or as a single operation focused totally on a spec ific urban environment. Major Army UO are often part of a joint and multinational effort requiring interagency and civil- military coordination that may include t he full spectrum of Army operations. Commanders of Army major operations must determine if UO are essential to mission accomplishment. If so, commanders must carefully integrate the opera- tions into campaign planning to support the operational objectives of the JFC. Army leaders conducting UO must— • Assess the urban area to determine decisive points. • Shape the operation to set the conditions for success. • Precisely mass the effects of combat power to rapidly dom inate the area. • Then transition the urban area to the control of another agency or back to legitimate civilian control. URBAN PERSPECTIVE 1-2. As a subset of all Army operatio ns, UO are operations focused on an urban environm ent. UO include the full range of Arm y operations—offensive, defensive, stability, and support—that m ay be executed, either sequentially or sim ultaneously, during the conduct of a single urban operation. Depending on the m ission, enem y, terrain and weather, troops and support available, tim e available, civil considerations (MET T-TC), urban operations may—or may not—be conducted predominantly within the urban area (see Figure 1-1). Furtherm ore, UO m ay be the sole m ission of the com mander or one of several tasks nested in a larger operation. Regardless of the types of operations conducted or whether the ur ban area is the single focus of the operation or only one com ponent of a larger operation, the com plex urban environm ent significantly affects the overall conduct of the m ission. 1-2"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" Urba n Outlook EN EM Y AR MY CIVIL Contr ol of the Urba n A rea Ty pe of Op eration S T A R T ST OP Combat Service Su pp ort UO May Con tinue Unde r Civilian Control of th e Urban A rea  UO Fram ework Offense Defen se Stab ility Supp ort UO ar e of ten f ull sp ectrum an d therefore N OT nece ss arily focus ed o nly on urba n c ombat Political Ob jectives and METT-TC Make All UO Unique ASSE SS DO MIN ATE TR ANSITION SH APE URB AN OPER ATIONS Tim e Duration of UO Can Be Me asured in Days or Ye ars Dependi ng on F actors of MET T-TC Figure 1-1. Full Spectrum Urban Operations 1-3. When conceptualizing urban operations, com manders understand two important terms: urban area and urban en vironm ent. The first is a subset of the second. An urban area is a topographical complex where man- made cons truction or high population dens ity is the dominant feature. Focusing on urban areas means concentrating on the physical aspects of the area and their effects on tactics, techniques, and procedures. The urban environment includes the physical aspects of the urban area as well as the complex and dynamic interaction and relation sh ips betw een its k ey comp onents—the terrain (natural and man-made), the population, and the s upporting infras tructure—as an overlapping and interdependent system of systems. Critical elem ents of the infrastructure m ay lie far beyond the area’s physical con- fines. F or exam ple, the generating source providing power to the urban energy system is part of that system but may be located well outside of the urban area. Sim ilarly, effects of the interaction between com ponents of the infrastructure, located both inside an d outside the urban area, extend well into sm aller, neighboring urban areas and surrounding rural areas and often form their political, econom ic, and cultural focus. Understanding the total urban environment is essential to planning and conducting the full range of Arm y urban operations across the spectrum of conflict. HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF URBAN AREAS IN WARFARE 1-4. Urban areas always have been central to, or have significantly influenced, m ilitary operations. One of the first urban-centered battles was the siege of Troy at the beginning of Greek history. Moreover, m uch of the history of early Greece revolved around wars between its city-states or with Persia and centered on the conquest, siege, or blockade of cities. F ive 1-3"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ hundred years later, the Roman Empire replaced Greece as the dominant world power although urban areas remain ed central to Roman warfare. Even Rom e’s history can be viewed as a m icrocosm of urban warfare over the past two thousand years. Though m ilitary oper ations within the physical confines of m any of these historic urban areas were not the norm , the focus of these operations was their conquest or control. Rome A Microcosm of Urban Warfare During two millennia, Rome has been the cent er of at least 12 battles. The Gauls lay siege to Rome first in 387 BC. That first siege lasted six months and ended after the barbarians burnt much of the ci ty. The surviving patrician families paid a ransom for the withdrawal of Brennus ’ army. From 408 to 410 AD, the Goth leader, Alaric, successfully besieged Rome no less than three times. The Byzantine General Belisarius captured Ro me twice from the Goths and withstood siege inside the city once between 536 and 549. Five hundred years later in 1084, Norman adventurer Robert Guiscard captured medieval Rome and sacked the city during a dispute between the P ope and the Holy Roman Empire. Forces of the Holy Roman Empire again storm ed and captured the city to punish the Pope in 1527. During the Italian Revolution in 1849, a French army supporting the Pope captured the city from the Itali an revolutionary army under Garibaldi. In 1944, the last military action took plac e in and around Rome when the US Fifth Army captured the city from the retr eating German army. Rome’s turbulent history—fought over ethnic and religious differences, prestige, and military necessity—demonstrates the importanc e of urban areas in warfare and the various causes and combatants wi thin this complex environment. 1-5. Although Rome last saw combat in 1944, urban areas have been no less prom inent in warfare since that ti me. Beirut in Lebanon, Grozny in Chechnya, and Saraj evo in Bosnia-Herzegovina have been centers of conflict in the last 50 years. Urban areas, now more pervasive than ever before, will continue to be essential to successful operational and strategic warfighting. Today, arm ies cannot execute major m ilitary operations without the influence of surrounding urban environm ents (with the possible exception of the open desert). STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE OF URBAN AREAS 1-6. Several reasons have attracted (a nd continue to attract) armies to combat in urban areas: • A military force chooses to position it self in an urban area to capitalize on the perceived advantages offered by the environm ent. In contrast, an opposing force, by analyzing the factors of the situation, determ ines that it must enter the urban area to attack and destroy its enemy (or devote essential com bat po wer to their isolation). • The urban area’s infrastructure, capabilities, or other resources have significant operational or strategic value. • The urban area has significant sym bolic im portance. 1-4"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" Urba n Outlook • The urban area’s geographical location dom inates a region or avenue of approach. 1-7. Russia’s 1994 experience in Chec hnya illustrates an increasingly impor- tant motivation for conducting urban operations. The Chechen rebels, after failing to engage Russian forces outside the city, chose to turn Grozny into the battlefield. L eaders of the defeat ed Chechen conventional forces recog- nized that fighting in the urban area provided them their best chance for success. The com plexities of urban com bat and the perceived advantages of defending an urban area mitigated their numerical and technological inferiority. T he urban area provided the Chechens protection from fires, resources, interior lines, and covered and concealed positions and movement. Given such advantages offered by the environm ent, sm aller or less- sophisticated m ilitary forces have sim ila rly chosen to fight in urban areas. 1-8. Such advantages of operating in an urban environment also prompt forces to conduct an urban operation to facilitate a larger cam paign plan and decisive battle in another location. The urban operation can focus the enem y on the urban area and allow other forces to conduct operations elsewhere. From a defensive perspective, an urban defense may gain time and space to reorganize forces in new defensive posi tions, to divert enem y forces from other critical tasks, or to prepare to conduct offensive operations. To some extent, these reasons m otivated Sovi et forces defending Leningrad and Stalingrad from the Germans in Worl d War II. The stubborn defense per- mitted the Soviets to reorganize for late r offensive operations. From an offen- sive perspective, an attack on an urban area may be a shaping operation used to divert resources from the decisive operation that will follow. 1-9. Armies also fight in an urban area to obtain som e critical feature or resource in the area, such as a port facility. The desire to control an important seaport and access to the Persian Gulf largely m otivated the Iranian and Iraqi struggle for Basra in the 1980s. Earlier, in 1944, British forces fought German units in Arnhem fo r control of the Rhine River Bridge. Other infrastructure of the urban environm ent m ay have operational or strategic significance and can com pel m ilitary forces to attack or defend the area. As urban areas account for an increasing share of a country’s national income, often generating over 50 percent of gross national product, the stra- tegic implications for their control or influence becom e even greater. 1-10. Urban areas are often located on te rrain that dominates a region or an avenue of approach. In these cases, offensive arm ies capture these areas to proceed with security to another objective. Conversely, defensive forces com monly defend the area to deny the area of operations. To illustrate, Cassino, Italy stood astride the critical highway approach up the Liri valley to Rom e. The allies had to attack and capture the m onastery to facilitate the allied offensive north. Cassino’s lo cation m ade bypassing virtually impossible. Likewise, Israeli army urban operations in Beirut were (and have continued to be) a result of its strate gic location near the Israeli security zone; various Arab insurgent and terrorist groups used Beirut as a base for attacks against Israel. Beirut evolved as the m ajor base of the P alestine Liberation Organization, a ma jor opponent of Israel. Beirut’s location made it a security threat to Israel and thus compelled several major Israeli operations in the urban area (see Appendix A). 1-5"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ 1-11. Another reason for engaging in urban operations is the sym bolic— historical, cultural, political, and even econom ic—im portance of m any urban areas. Often, capital cities—such as Rom e, Paris, Seoul, and Berlin—are identified as the strategic centers of gravity of their respective nations. Possessing or threatening these urban areas m ay im pact directly on the out- come of a conflict. The objective of Germany’s wars with France in 1870 and 1914 was ultimately Paris. Napoleon’s 1812 campaign had as its objective Moscow, as did Hitler’s 1941 offensive into Russia. The objective of the Soviet 1945 offensive was Berlin, and the No rth Vietnamese 1975 offensive had as its objective the South’s capital of Saigon. Still, history also rem inds us that com manders assess the sustainability and decisiveness of operations directed toward these “prestige” objectives. Fo r example, in 1812, Napoleon captured Moscow but had to evacuate it within 30 days. He lacked supplies and shelter, failed to destroy the Russian Ar my, and failed to defeat the political will of the Czar and the people. Sim ilarly, the North Korean occupation of Seoul during the Korean War was equally indecisive. US ARMY’S EXPERIENCE IN URBAN OPERATIONS 1-12. The US Arm y has a varied history of conducting operations to attack or defend larger urban areas. The Am erican Revolution saw the Arm y conduct several urban operations. These operatio ns included the unsuccessful defense of New York, the successful attack on Trenton, and the decisive siege and attack on British forces at Yorktown. The Mexican War also had a successful assault on the fortified city of Monterey and the decisive siege of Mexico City. During the Am erican Civil War, the arm ies, in the tradition of Napoleonic maneuver warfare, avoided urban areas and fought in the open. However, the opposing arm ies frequently m ade urban areas their obj ective because of their importance as railheads. Success in the siege of several key urban areas—Vicksburg, Atlanta, and Petersburg—contributed to the Northern victory. 1-13. Following the Civil War, the US Arm y faced no large-scale urban combat for several generations. The Indian Wars, the Spanish-Am erican War, the Philippine Insurrection, and even World War I did not require the Arm y to fight in large urban areas. Between the Civil War and World War II, the US Arm y fought in several urban areas worldwide supporting US com- mitm ents. These lim ited urban com bat operations were sm all but essential parts of what were urban stability operations. From 1900 to 1901, the Army provided public security for a sect or of Peking, China of around 50,000 inhabitants. The Arm y conducted UO and, in the course of the operation, the 9th US Infantry suffered 20-percent casu alties while fighting in Tientsin. Punitive expeditions to places such as Siberia, Cuba, Philippines, Central Am erica, and Mexico put the Arm y in various urban situations that required using m ilitary power, notably, the occu pation and security of Vera Cruz, Mexico in 1914. In the context of thes e smaller-scale contingencies (SSCs), UO be came a staple of US Army e mplo yme nt. 1-14. World War II forced the Arm y to grapple with the issues of large-scale urban combat almost immediately. In his 1941 defense of the Philippines, General MacArthur examined how to defend Manila. Manila represented a large, modern, friendly urban area, which was the capital city of a close US 1-6"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" Urba n Outlook ally. Defending the urban area posed num erous challenges. Ultim ately General MacArthur determined that he could best conduct its defense outside the city by defeating the enem y forces in com bat on the invasion beaches or shortly after they landed. When Japanese forces defeated MacArthur’s Philippine Arm y in a series of engagements, MacArthur had to decide how best to protect the friend ly populace of Manila. He had two choices: abandoning the city or waging a costly defense that would likely result in the city’s destruction, thou sands of noncombatant casualties, and no operational advantage. He had little choice but to declare Manila an open city and move his forces to Bataan to wa ge an operational defense in the vain hope that a counteroffensive could relie ve his isolated force. On 2 January 1942, Japanese forces entered Manila unopposed. 1-15. Had General MacArthur decided to defend Manila, his forces would have found scant doctrine in the Army regarding how to fight in an urban area. Doctrine for urban operations did not appear until early 1944, when faced with the possibility of fighting through the larger urban areas of Western Europe. At his tim e the US Arm y published FM 31-50, Attack on a Fortified Position and Com bat in Towns . This manual had the first formal discussion of how the Arm y viewed urban combat. It was based on the Army’s lim ited experiences in the Mediterranean theater and the study of Germ an and Soviet experiences on the Eastern front. 1-16. FM 31-50 emphasized a deliberate pace, individual and sm all unit ini- tiative, the liberal use of direct and indirect firepower, and decentralized com mand and execution. It focused on the urban area (as opposed to the envi- ronment); however, it did include po licies towards the noncombatants. The manual was also focused at the regime ntal com bat team level. Com ple- menting the doctrine of FM 31-50 was the 1944 operations manual, FM 100-5. This latter m anual em phasized the im portance of com bined arm s actions and the need for extensive reconnaissance of prepared and defended cities. The Arm y successfully im plem ented this doct rine in several major instances of urban combat, most notably the capture of the first German city, Aachen, and hundreds of small-scale urban assaults on cities, towns, and villages across France, the Benelux, and Germany. Ar my forces also successfully employed this urban combat doctrine during the liberation of Manila in 1945. 1-17. The legacy of this era of Arm y op erations was an effective tactical solu- tion to urban offensive combat: isolat e the urban area, seize a foothold, and expand the foothold block by block until occupying the entire urban area and destroying the enem y. T he doctrine’s emphasis on firepower kept friendly casualties to a minim um. Unfortunately, when enem y forces stoutly defended the urban area, the em phasis on firepower resulted in its virtual destruction and high casualties among noncombatants. 1-18. The doctrinal approach honed in World War II remained the accepted Army approach to urban combat to the century’s end. The last successful im plem entation occurred when liberating Seoul during the Korean War. The Vietnam conflict did not offer the Army opportunities or the requirem ent to practice urban combat or test and refine doctrine on a large scale. The largest urban battle, Hue, was a chaotic tactical battle that validated most of the historical lessons of urban combat without generating any new doctrinal insights for large-scale urban warfare. 1-7"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ 1-19. From the mid-1950s through the 1990s, the Army conducted UO in the United States in support of civil authorities during civil unrest and anti- Vietnam protests. Som e operations involved num erous active and reserve component forces engaged in restoring pu blic order. The Detroit riots of 1967 and the Los Angeles riots of 1992 requir ed the commitments of active and National Guard units. In 1968, the Army deployed over 35,000 troops to Washington D.C., Chicago, and Baltim ore following the death of Dr. Martin Luthe r King, Jr. 1-20. In the 1970s and 1980s, Army doctrine predominantly focused on urban areas and successfully fighting a conven tional ground war against Soviet and Warsaw Pact forces in Central Europe. The 1979 FM 90-10, Military Opera - tions on Urbanized Terrain (MOUT), described how to conduct urban opera- tions against Soviet forces in Germany . Its concepts were never tested other than in simulation, and its approach to urban combat was not substantially different from that practiced by the Army since World War II. Despite previous doctrine’s admonition to avoi d cities, the Army has had to fight in them in diverse circumstances. MODERN ARMY URBAN OPERATIONS 1-21. Modern urban operations span the full range of possible applications of military power. At the high end of the spectrum of conflict is m ajor theater war (MTW) dominated by offensive an d defensive operations that, when undertaken, will com monly include urban operations. At the lowest level are a multitude of urban peacetim e m ilitar y engagem ent (PME) activities. These activities foster and strengthen allia nces and coalitions as well as deter aggression on the part of potential threats. At m id-level between MT W and PME are SSC urban operations. As a result of being mid-range, any type of operation m ay potentially dom inate an SSC; however, the various urban stability operations form the m ajority. At higher echelons, these separations are often viewed as levels of intensit y. For the tactical units conducting urban operations, these divisions appear indistinct, as the intensity is often high despite where the operation fa lls within the level of conflict. MAJOR THEATER WAR 1-22. While UO in a MT W can encom pass the full range of Arm y operations, the offense and defense will be centra l and decisive to success. Although mindful of collateral damage and noncombatants, urban operations in a MT W (com pared to urban operations in SSCs or as part of PME activities) will be the least constrained because vita l national interests will be at stake. UO in a MTW, therefore, will require a significant investm ent of resources of all types. Specialized units such as psyc hological operations, civil affairs, and other special operations forces (SOF) will likely be in high dem and. UO in a MTW will require an abundance of infantry and m ay require significant casualty replacements and medical suppo rt. Logistics to support the distinc- tive urban environment includes larg e amounts of lethal and nonlethal specialty m unitions, such as sm oke, precision field artillery rounds, dem oli- tions, and hand grenades. 1-23. Of potential urban scenarios confronting the future Army, urban offensive and defensive operations in an MT W are the m ost dangerous and 1-8"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" Urba n Outlook challenging. They will take one of two principal form s: fluid or siege. In a fluid urban combat operation, both sides may contend for position and advan- tage in the urban battlespace. The attack er will seek to quickly seize decisive points before the enem y is able to establish a cohesive defense. This will likely require the attacker to bypass enem y defensive positions whose occupa- tion or reduction are not critical to mi ssion success. Conversely, the defender may use interior lines to shift forces in a fluid defense. In a siege, one side clearly has the initiative as the attacker, and the other side has the advan- tages of the defense. A siege situation can develop as a result of an initial fluid urban battle, or it m ay be a func tion of previous m ilitary operations that occurred outside the urban area. The Arm y doctrine’s em phasis on initiative, agility, depth, synchronizat ion, and versatility generally supports the fluid form of urban combat; howe ver, commanders also understand that the factors of MET T-TC m ay support a longer-term , siege approach. SMALLER-SCALE CONTINGENCIES 1-24. SSCs encom pass a wide range of m ilitary operations that fall between MTW and PME and frequently involve urban operations. SSCs are conducted to facilitate diplom acy and support politic al initiatives, protect Am erican lives and interests, and disrupt illegal activi ties. Joint task forces (JTFs) typically conduct SSCs although one service m ay provide the bulk of the force. During these urban contingencies, resources are often m ore lim ited and the restraints on applying combat power are greater as the need to maintain legi- tim acy will grow in im portance. Typically, Arm y forces will need the assis- tance of m ultinational partners, other agencies, local noncom batants, and nongovernm ental organizations (NGOs) to successfully complete the mission. PEACETIME MILITARY ENGAGEMENTS 1-25. UO, at the lowest level of conflic t, may also take many forms. They serve to strengthen alliances and coalit ions, discourage arm s races, com bat terrorism , and generally reduce the po tential for instability and conflict. Com bat in PME activities is not the no rm . They are least likely to involve the use of force (when necessary, nonlethal is preferred). The presence of Arm y forces performing PME activities in fo reign urban areas provides a visible sign of US com mitm ent to peace and stability in that region. In m any of these lower-intensity UO, Arm y forces often support other agencies. These other agencies actually plan and lead the operation. Arm y forces provide military capabilities (to include organization an d leadership), m anpower, equipm ent, and other resources not readily available. As with UO in SSCs, proactive and aggressive interaction and coordination with multinational partners, governm ental and nongovernm ental organizations, and the urban populace will be vital to success.

These ROE help preclude soldiers from random ly using deadly force while allowing them sufficient la titude to accomplish the mission and defend them selves. Training in ROE also includes significant and periodic changes that test and develop flexibility in and adaptability to a fluid environm ent. Additionally, force preparedness m andates integrating sim ula- tions, exercises at urban training site s, and the actual use of urban terrain into tactical- and operational-level intra- and interservice training. Concurrent training extends from the in dividual soldier to the joint level. Additionally, preparedness also incl udes enhancing interoperability in regards to urban m ultinational and interagency operations. 1-27. Realistic UO training (as well as the conduct of real world operations) has the added benefit of identifying operational requirem ents and resultant changes necessary in our doctrine, organizations, materiel design, leadership, and soldier support (see Fig- ure 1-2). While technology (m aterial) and organizational changes are critical, soldiers remain the decisive means for success. The technology and organizational changes will be a critical enabler to achieve the agile, sim ul- taneous, and precise lethality required in urban operations. In the future, technology m ay lead to a radically new operational concept and approach to urban operations. Still, com petent lead ers and well-trained and disciplined soldiers will rem ain the decisive m eans for the Arm y to succeed in this com plex, m ultidim ensional, and noncontiguous urban environm ent.

Planning for urban operations requires careful IPB, with particular emphasis on the three- dimensional nature of the topography and the intricate social struc- ture of the population. FM 3-0 Of all the environments in which to conduct operations, the urban envi- ronment confronts Army commanders with a combination of difficulties rarely found elsewhere. Its distinct characteristics result from an intric ate topography and high population dens ity. The topography’s complexity stems from the man-made features and supporting infrastructure super- imposed on the natural terrain. Hundreds, thousands, or millions of civil- ians may be near or intermingled with soldiers—friendly and enemy. T his second factor, and the human dimension it represents, is potentially the most important and perplexing for co mmanders and their staffs to under- stand and evaluate. The intelligence preparation of the battlefield (IPB) process remains unaffected by urban areas (see FM 34-130 and Appen- dix B); this chapter provides information essential to the conduct of the IPB for an urban environment.

An Army policy popular with one urban group may cause resentment and hostility in another due to diverse cultural differences. All diffi culties potentially exist, but they increase the complexity for Army forces operating in urban areas. These difficulties range from conventional military forces to disease and starvation (see Chapter 3) to a pervasive media—often acutely present in intricate combinations. Thus, command ers at all levels make extraordi- nary efforts to assess and understand their particular urban environment to plan, prepare for, and execut e effective urban operations (UO). A COMPLEX ENVIRONMENT 2-1. Urban areas vary depending on their history, the cultures of their inhabitants, their econom ic developm ent, the local clim ate, available building materials, and m any other factors. This variety exists not only am ong urban areas but also within any particular area. The ever-changing mix of natural and man-made features in urban areas present com manders with som e of the most difficult terrain in which to conduct m ilitary operations. 2-2. Although urban areas possess similar characteristics, no two are iden- tical. The sprawl of Los Angeles, fo r example, bears little physical resem- blance to New Delhi. Societal characte ristics most significantly affect each area’s uniqueness and complexity. While com plex, inform ation about the ter- rain, its potential effects on operations , and how it changes over time may be determ ined with som e degree of certai nty. However, the human dimension is much more difficult to understand and assess, particularly its effects on m ili- tary operations. Like any environm ent, the side that can best understand and exploit the effects of the urban envi ronment has the best chance of success . TERRAI N SO CIET Y INF RA- ST RU CTURE Figure 2-1. Key s to Understanding the Urban Env ironment 2-3. Whether a large m etropolis or a sm all village, each urban environ- ment has an identifiable system of components that constantly change and interact. This “system of sys- tems” consists of the terrain , the society , and the infrastructure that links the two (see F igure 2-1). (These categories highlight the key aspects to understanding the urban environm ent and will be used throughout the manual; however, the civil-m ilitary operations (CMO) discussion in Chapter 9 provides an alternate method for categorizing and assessing the effects of civil considerations in any operational environm ent. ) 2-4. These system s are not separate and distinct categories but rather over- lapping and interdependent. T horough ly analyzing these elem ents, along with the other factors of m ission, enem y, weather, troops and support available, time, and civil considerations— • Contributes to commanders’ situational understanding. • Potentially lessens the num ber and cost of close com bat engagem ents. 2-2"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" Urba n Env ironme nt • Allows them to develop courses of action that apply appropriate resources against decisive points. 2-5. In stability operations and suppo rt operations, this understanding allows commanders to engage and domina te the decisive points critical to maintaining peace or restoring norm alcy to the urban environm ent. Although each system is categorized into subo rdinate com ponents or subsystem s, com - manders often “step back” and visualize each system , the com plex urban environm ent, and their area of operatio ns (AO). This “systems thinking” aids com manders in uncovering key relationships and intersections that can help reveal centers of gravity (COGs) and decisive points. 2-6. To com prehend the urban environm ent and its com ponents to the fullest extent possible, com manders carefully integrate and em ploy special opera- tions forces (SOF)—to include psycholo gical operations (PSYOP) and civil affairs units—and a m yriad of other hum an intelligence (HUMINT) assets and regional, language, and cultural ex perts. The societal aspects and inte- grating infrastructure will challenge com manders’ assessm ent and under- standing. These aspects will also requ ire greater dependence on nonm ilitary and nongovernm ental organizations (NGOs) and host-nation agencies for their inform ation, knowledge, and expert ise. This last consideration requires com manders to develop effective techniqu es and procedures for coordinating and interacting with these agencies. URBAN TERRAIN 2-7. Although com plex and difficult to penetrate with m any intelligence, sur- veillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) assets, the terrain is the m ost recogniz- able aspect of an urban area. Truly und erstanding it, however, requires com- prehending its multidim ensional nature. The terrain consists of natural and man- made feature s, wi th man- made features dominating; an analysis con- siders both. Buildings, streets, and othe r infrastructure have varied patterns, form s, and sizes. T he infinite ways in which these factors can intertwine make it difficult to describe a “typica l” urban area. However, these elem ents provide a fram ework for understanding the com plex terrain in an urban area. Furtherm ore, man-m ade features significantly affect m ilitary system s and soldiers, and thus tactics and operations . General effects on urban operations are discussed in this chapter. Specific effects on battlefield operating system s (BOS) (see Chapters 5 and 9) and the rang e of operations (see Chapters 6, 7, and 8) are interwoven throughout the manual. MULTIDIMENSIONAL BATTLEFIELD 2-8. Urban areas present an extraord inary blend of horizontal, vertical, interior, exterior, and subterranean form s superim posed on the natural relief, drainage, and vegetation. An urban area may appear dwarfed on a map by the surrounding countryside. In fact, the size and extent of the urban battlespace is many times that of a si milarly sized portion of natural terrain. The sheer volum e and density created by urban geom etry can m ake UO resource intensive in tim e, m anpower, and m ateriel. 2-9. Like natural disasters, UO can ra dically alter the physical character of the urban terrain in ways not experienced in other environm ents.

A power outage can cause flooding (especially in subsurface areas) by shutting down pumping stations. Entire buildings m ay be destroyed, elim ina- ting reference points and leaving large piles of rubble. Additionally, buildings and other urban structures, dam aged but not destroyed, can still be effective obstacles and possible booby traps. T heir weakened construction and unstable structure increase the risk of in jury to soldiers and civilians m oving within them . (Engineers often determ ine whether the buildings can support occupation by Arm y forces or civilians.) The likely presence of toxic industrial materials (TIM) can create additional obstacles. 2-10. Com manders in other environm ents norm ally address the depth, breadth, and height of their AO in term s of two areas: airspace and surface . In an urban environm ent, they broaden their scope to include supersurface and subsurface areas (see Figure 2-2). Although spatially separated, each area m ay be used as an avenue of a pproach or m obility corridor, line of com - munications (L OC), and engagem ent area. Figure 2-2.

Supersurface and subsurface areas magnify the complexity of the urban physical environment. Commander s consider activities that occur outside buildings and subterranean areas (the external space) as well as the activities that occur unseen in buildings and subterranean systems (the internal space). The internal space furthe r challenges command, control, and intelligence collection activities and in creases the com bat power required to conduct UO. Commanders develop methods to help themselves, their staffs, and their subordinate com manders and staffs to represent and visualize the multiple dim ensions. Such dim ensions can change rapidly simply due to continued urban growth or, as described earlier, the effects of nature and UO them selves. 2-4"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" Urba n Env ironme nt Airspace 2-12. Aircraft and aerial munitions use the airspace as rapid avenues of ap- proach in urbanized areas. Forces can use aviation assets for observation and reconnaissance, aerial attack, or high-s peed insertion and extraction of sol- diers, supplies, and equipment. Some su rface obstacles, such as rubble, do not affect aviation assets. However, buildings of varying height and the increased density of towers, signs, po wer lines, and other urban constructions create obstacles to flight and the traj ectory of many munitions (m asking). These obstacles can lim it low-altitude m aneuverability in the urban airspace. Excellent cover and concealment afford ed enemy gunners in an urban area increases aviation vulnerability to sm all arm s and m an-portable air defense systems (MANPADS), particularly when supporting ground forces. Surface 2-13. Surface areas apply to exterior gro und level areas, such as parking lots, airfields, highways, streets, sidewalks, fields, and parks. They often provide primary avenues of approach and the means for rapid advance. However, buildings and other structures often canalize forces m oving along them . As such, obstacles on urban surface areas usually have m ore effect than those in open terrain since bypass often requires entering and transiting buildings or radical changes to selected routes. Where urban areas abut the ocean or sea, large lakes, and m ajor rivers, the surface of these bodies of water may pro- vide key friendly and threat avenues of approach or essential L OCs and, therefore, m ay be a significant consideration for Arm y com manders. As such, amphibious and river-crossing operations may be an integral part of the over- all urban operation. 2-14. Larger open areas—such as stadium s, sports fields, school play- grounds, and parking lots—are often cri tical areas during urban operations. They can provide locations for displace d civilians, interrogation centers, and prisoner of war holding facilities. Thes e areas also can afford suitable aircraft landing and pickup zones and artillery firing locations. They can provide logistic support areas and aerial resu pply possibilities because they are often centrally located. Supers urface 2-15. These areas include the internal floors or levels ( intrasurface areas) and external roofs or tops of buildings , stadiums, to we rs, o r othe r vertical structures. They can provide cover and concealm ent; lim it or enhance obser- vation and fields of fire; and restrict , canalize, or block m ovem ent. However, forces can move within and between in trasurface areas creating additional, though normally secondary, avenues of approach. Rooftops m ay offer ideal locations for landing helicopters for sm all-scale air assaults and aerial resup- ply. First, engineers analyze buildings for their structural integrity and obstacles. Such obstacles include electrical wires, antennas, and enem y- em placed m ines (although personnel may be inserted by jum ping, rappelling, or fast roping from a hovering helicop ter and extracted by hoist mechanisms).

Overall, elevated firing positions reduce the value of any cover in surrounding open areas and perm it engagem ent at close range without risk of im mediate close assault. This area (and the subsurface area) requires co mmanders to think, plan, and execute ground operations vertically as well as horizontally. In this latter regard, UO share strong similarities with mo untain operations (see FM 3-97.6). Subs urface 2-16. These areas are subterranean or below surface level. They may serve as secondary and, in fewer instances, pr imary avenues of approach at lower tactical levels. When thoroughly reco nnoitered and controlled, they offer excellent covered and concealed LOCs for moving supplies and evacuating casualties. They may also provide sites for caching and stockpiling supplies. Subsurface areas include the subways, tunnels, sewers, drainage systems, cellars, civil defense shelters, and othe r various underground utility system s. In older cities, they may include anci ent hand-dug tunnels and catacombs. Both attacker and defender can use subsurface areas to gain surprise and maneuver against the rear and flanks of a threat and to conduct ambushes. However, these areas are often the m ost restrictive and easiest to defend or block. Their effectiveness depends on superior knowledge of their existence and overall design. Arm y com manders m ay need to consider potential ave- nues of approach afforded by the subsurface areas of rivers and m ajor bodies of water that border urban areas. This particularly applies when operating as part of a joint task force (JTF) task organized with SOF or when opposing a threat with sim ilar capabilities. BROAD URBAN PATTERNS 2-17. Four major urban patterns can in fluence UO (see Figure 2-3). Central to two of the patterns (satellite and network) is the hub or dominant urban area or pattern around which outlying urban areas or patterns radiate. (A segmented urban area, because it tends to be a larger urban area, can often be a hub.) In offensive and defensive op erations, the hub serves as a pivot or strong point; as such, it often becomes a major obstacle to an attacker. If the attacker chooses to bypass the urban area (hub) located along his axis of advance without first isolating the area, he may expose his flank to attack from the hub as well as dependent urban areas or subordinate satellite patterns. Because the focus of stability operations and support operations is on people, com manders understand the value and influence of the hub to the econom ic, political, or cultural well being of the surrounding area. Whether or not a hub, commanders must remember that urban areas are not islands; all are connected to the surrounding rural (and other urban) areas through fluid and permeable boundaries and LOCs. Satellite Pattern 2-18. This common pattern consists of a central hub surrounded by smaller, dependent urban areas. LOCs tend to converge on the hub. The natural ter- rain throughout this pattern is relati vely homogenous. Outlying areas often support the principal urban area at the hub with means of reinforcement, resupply, and evacuation. In some inst ances, they may serve as mutually 2-6"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" Urba n Env ironme nt supporting battle positions. Com manders should consider the effects of the outlying urban areas on operations within the hub, and, conversely, the effects of operations within the hub on outlying urban areas. Inform ation operations (IO), for exam ple, targeted prim arily at the hub of a satellite pattern may subsequently influence ou tlying urban areas and achieve neces- sary effects without having to commit specific resources to these areas.

Broad Urban Patterns Network Pattern 2-19. The network pattern represents th e interlocking of the prim ary hubs of subordinate satellite patterns. Its elem ents are m ore self-sufficient and less supportive of each other, although a dom inant hub m ay exist. Maj or LOCs in a network extend more than in a satellite pattern and take m ore of a rec- tangular rather than a convergent form. Its natural terrain may vary more than in a single satellite array. Operations in one area m ay or m ay not easily influence, or be influenced by, other urban areas in the pattern. Linear Pattern 2-20. Potentially a subelem ent of the previous two patterns, the linear pattern may form one ray of the satellite pattern or be found along connecting links between the hubs of a network. Most frequently, this pattern results from the stringing of m inor urban areas along a confined natural terrain corridor, such as an el ongated valley, a body of water, or a man-made communications route. In offe nsive and defensive operations, this latter form of the linear pattern facilit ates developing a series of strong defensive positions in depth, effectivel y blocking or delaying an attacking force moving along the canalized terrain. 2-7"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ Segment Pattern 2-21. When dominant natural terrain, su ch as a river or man-made features (canals, major highways, or railways), di vides an urban area, it creates a seg- mented pattern. This pattern often make s it easier for commanders to assign areas of operations to subordinate com manders. However, this pattern may fragment operations and increase risk to an operation requiring mutual support between subordinate units. Still, the segm ented urban areas m ay allow com manders to isolate threats m ore easily in these areas and focus operations within segm ents that cont ain their decisive points. Although an integral part of the whole (the urban area), each segm ent may develop distinct social, econom ic, cultural, and political characteristics. This social segmenting may be ne fit co mmande rs faced wi th lim ited assets to influence or control the urban populace. After thorou ghly analyzing the society, they may be able to focus IO and populace and re sources control measures against only specific segments that affect decisive operations. Com manders m ay need only to isolate other segm ents or m ay need to j ust m onitor for any significant changes in the attitudes, beliefs, or ac tions of the civilians located there. LESSER STREET PATTERNS 2-22. Lesser patterns in the urban area result from the layout of the streets, roads, highways, and other thoroughfares. T hey evolve from influences of natural terrain, the original designer’s personal prej udices, and the changing needs of the inhabitants. Street patte rns (and widths) influence all BOS; however, they greatly affect maneuv er, command and control, and combat service support. (In som e portions of older Middle Eastern urban areas, the labyrinths of streets were designed on ly to allow two loaded donkeys to pass each other; tanks are too wide. ) Urban areas can display any of three basic patterns and their combinations: radial , grid , and irregular (see Figure 2-4). Figure 2-4. Basic Internal Street Patterns Radial Grid Irregular Radial 2-23. Societies of highly concentrated religious or secular power often con- struct urban areas with a radial design: all primary thoroughfares radiating out from the center of power. Cities with this design m ay signal an im portant historical aspect in the overall analys is of the urban society. Terrain per- mitting, these streets m ay extend outward in a com plete circle or m ay form a semicircle or arc when a focal point abuts a natural barrier, such as a coast- line or m ountain. To increase m obility and traffic flow, societies often add 2-8"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" Urba n Env ironme nt concentric loops or rings to larger radial patterns. Unless commanders carefully plan boundaries, routes, and axes of advance, their subordinate units’ movement or maneuver may be inadvertently funneled toward the center of urban areas with this pattern resulting in congestion, loss of momentum, and an increased potent ial for ambush or fratricide. Grid 2-24. The most adaptable and universal form for urban areas is the grid pattern: lines of streets at right angles to one another form ing blocks sim ilar to the pattern of a chessboard. A grid pattern can fill in and eventually take over an original radial pattern. Grid pa tterns often appear to ease the assign- ment of boundaries for subordinates units. However, co mmanders also con- sider how the natural terrain influences operations and the establishm ent of control measures. They also consider th e influence of the buildings and other structures lining these streets, such as their height and construction, before assigning boundaries and develo ping other control measures. 2-25. Describing boundaries and phase lin es by easily recognizable features is as important in urban areas as else where. If available, natural features are a better descriptor than man-made features that may be altered or unrecognizable. When Arm y forces work closely with local law enforcem ent agencies, com manders m ay not need to assess the effect of street patterns on the assignment of boundaries. Instea d, commanders may assign boundaries overlaid on existing adm inistrative boundaries used by local law enforcem ent agencies to increase interoperab ility and aid in unity of effort. Irregular 2-26. In most urban areas, regardless of the original intent, plan, or vision, existing street patterns em erge from successive plans overlaid one on another. Some are well planned to fit with previous plans while others a hap- hazard response to explosive urban growth. T he result m ay m ix patterns. Urban engineers and planners m ay specif ically design irregular patterns for aesthetic reasons (as in many suburban housing developments) or to conform to marked terrain relief. Irregular street patterns m ay alert com manders and analysts that the underlying natural te rrain may exert greater influence over operations than in other portions of the urban area. Finally, irregular street patterns m ake the m ovem ent and m aneuver of forces less predictable. AN URBAN MODEL 2-27. Throughout the world, urban area s have similar form and function. In form, urban areas contain like characterist ics, readily divisible into distinct sections or areas. F unctionally, they tend to be the centers of population, finance, politics, transportation, industry, and culture. While urban areas may be m odeled by several different means, Figure 2-5 on page 2-10 illus- trates the general forms and internal functions. Some forms and functions may overlap. For exam ple, high-rise bu ildings are located in core areas as well as in outlying areas and may be us ed for residential purposes. With the rapid urbanization associated with develo ping nations, the areas displayed in this urban model often m anifest them selves less clearly there than in developed nations. 2-9"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ Figure 2-5.

This analysis helps to determin e, in general term s, potential advan- tages and disadvantages each portion of the urban area may have toward accomplishing the urban operation. Ho wever, construction materials and methods can vary drastically. Com manders identify specific building types and construction and understand weapons effects on them . If a com mander desires precise effects, the chosen m unitions or weapons system must be sufficiently accurate, capable of penetrating the target structure (without exiting the other side), and achieve effects within. Often noncom batants, critical infrastructure, or protected ta rgets are in the vicinity. Com manders may need to determ ine if the surroundin g walls or structures will sufficiently absorb or negate the blast or therm al effects of the weapon. Regardless, understanding the structure of buildings in the urban AO allows commanders to determine the best me ans to acco mpl ish the mi ssi on. Core 2-29. The core is the heart of the urban area, the downtown or central business district. Relatively small and compact, it contains a large percentage of the urban area’s shops, offi ces, and public institutions. Often, it houses the headquarters for commercial and financial activities and contains important cultural, historical, and gove rnmental buildings. These activities prefer the core because of its acce ssibility. As the focal point of the transportation network, residents find the core the easiest part of the urban area to reach. It normally has the densest concentration of multistory buildings and subterranean features (underground parking garages, under- ground shopping centers, and basem ents). 2-30. High-rise buildings, varying greatl y in height (possibly 50 stories above ground and four stories below ground), make up the cores of today’s urban areas. Buildings routinely abut one anothe r, with little or no setback from the sidewalks. Building height and density (except in outlying high-rise areas) often decreases from the core to the ed ge of the residential areas, while the am ount of open areas frequently increas es. Modern urban planning allows for more open spaces between buildings than found in the cores of older urban 2-10"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" Urba n Env ironme nt areas. Most core areas have undergone constant redevelopm ent resulting in various types of construction. Com monly, brick buildings abound in the oldest part of the core; fram ed, heavy-clad structures in the next oldest part; and a concentration of fram ed, light-clad buildings in the newest part. The outer edge of the core, the core peri phery, has ordinarily undergone less change than the core resulting in buildings of uniform height (com monly two to three stories in towns and five to ten stories in larger urban areas). 2-31. Generally, offensive operations fo cused in core areas (even when effec- tively isolated) will require greater resources—particularly m anpower, tim e, and information—than in many other parts of the urban area. Mounted maneuver often proves m ore difficult in core areas because of fewer open areas, buildings closer to the street s, and m ore civilian vehicles. Rubbled buildings in central core areas (especia lly high-rise buildings) becom e greater obstacles to m obility as they can collaps e on and easily block thoroughfares. Rubble piles can afford excellent co vered and concealed positions for dismounted threat forces. Consequent ly, commanders use more dismounted forces as part of their combined arms operations. Conversely, the core m ay be critical to urban defensive operations, particularly older areas of heavier construction that afford greater protec tion. Despite potential difficulties, the core area m ay be key to accom plishing m any stability or support missions since it houses much of the human acti vity that occurs in the urban area. Industrial Area 2-32. Industrial areas often develop on the outskirts of the urban areas where com mercial transportation is easiest (along airfields and m ajor sea, river, rail, and highway routes). These areas will likely displace farther from the core and residential areas as ur ban planners recognize the potential threat of T IM. T he dispersed pattern of the buildings provides sufficient space for large cargoes, trucks, and materiel handling equipm ent. These areas m ay provide ideal sites for logist ic bases and m aintenance sites. While older, heavier-clad structures may be fo und, new construction consists of low, large, flat-roofed factory and warehous e buildings with large parking areas and work yards. These structures generally have steel fram e and lightweight exterior walls. Multistory structures usually have reinforced concrete floors and ceilings. 2-33. Toxic industrial chemicals and other TIM may be transported through an urban area (by rail, barge, truck, or pipeline) or found stored throughout. However, larger concentrations will ex ist in industrial areas, and their presence should concern Arm y forces operating near them . 2-34. Each year, over 70,000 different chemicals are produced, processed, or consumed globally. An estimated 25, 000 commercial facilities around the world produce, process, or store chem icals that have a legitim ate industrial use yet are also classified as chem ical warfare agents. Many other chem icals (not classified as weapons) m ay still be sufficiently hazardous to pose a con- siderable threat to Arm y forces and civilians in urban areas as choking agents or asphyxiates, flammables or incendiaries, water contaminants, low- grade blister or nerve agents, or deb ilitating irritants. These chem icals can be released either accidentally or de liberately. On 2 December 1984, nearly 40 tons of methylisocyanate used to pr oduce pesticides leaked from a storage 2-11"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ tank at Bhopal, India, killing thousands and injuring hundreds of thousands. Figure 2-6 contains a small sampling of other toxic industrial chemicals along with their industrial or comme rci al usage that co mmande rs may encounter in an urban area. The most common chemicals that pose a risk to Army forces are highly toxic irritant gases such as ammonia, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and sulfur dioxide.

Toxic Industrial Chemicals and Their Industrial or Commercial Uses 2-35. Standard chemical defense equi pment may not protect against (and chem ical detection devices m ay fail to detect) many toxic industrial chemi- cals. T herefore, the risk to soldie rs operating near the chem icals m ay increase. Com manders vigilantly identify these potential hazards, carefully consider them as part of their overa ll vulnerability analysis, factor the anal- ysis into their risk assessment, and execute necessary contamination avoid- ance measures. Any assessment includes the chance that toxic industrial chemicals may be deliberately released by a threat to gain advantage or accidentally released by friendly actions (see FM 3-21 and FM 3-14). Outlying High-Rise Area 2-36. High-rise areas consist of m ultis toried apartments, commercial offices, and businesses separated by large open areas, such as parking lots, parks, and individual one-story buildings. High -rise buildings are fram ed, light-clad construction with thin walls of brick, lightweight concrete, or glass. The autom obile, mass transit system s, and im proved road networks encourage these areas to grow and function further from the urban core. 2-12"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" Urba n Env ironme nt 2-37. Similar to the urban core, units gi ven the m ission to clear these areas, or even portions therein, will need more resources—m ost notably personnel and tim e—to accom plish their m ission. Com manders should consider courses of action that isolate these entire areas, m ultiple sections within these areas, or even individual buildings before a ssigning tasks. The tasks could rapidly drain a unit’s resources or unhinge othe r portions of the major operation. When defending, com manders who can in tegrate these areas in the defense will present the attacker with sim ilar resource problem s and m ay be appro- priate in a defense to delay. However, defending com manders ensure that the defense is a rranged s o that this p ortion cannot be easily isolated and bypassed. Defensive positions in struct ures m ay require extensive reinforce- ment due to light-clad construction. Residential Area 2-38. Residential areas can be found dispersed throughout the urban area; however, large suburban areas (or spra wl) norm ally form on the outskirts. Residential areas often consist of row ho uses or single-fam ily dwellings set in a grid or ringed pattern in a planned developm ent proj ect. Yards, gardens, trees, and fences usually separate the bu ildings in a residential area. Modern residential construction is often of lig ht-clad, fram ed wood construction, or brick. The com bined population of surrounding suburban areas often far out- num bers that of the urban area proper. Specific suburbs tend toward hom o- geneity based on ethnicity, religion, econ om ics, or som e other social aspect. Com manders locate and analyze these areas to determ ine their im pact on operations—often the m ost critical im portance is the people located there (see the subsequent discussion in this chapter on the urban society). 2-39. In offensive and defensive oper ations, com manders determ ine whether operations pose an unacceptable physical risk to civilians. If so, they m ay have to relocate civilians to a safer ar ea, perhaps another residential area. If not, commanders may implement a “stay-put” policy for that area and attem pt to isolate the effects of the operation from them . During support operations, residential locations m ay be the initial focal point for operations since m ost of the perm anent population is located there. 2-40. This area also contains a rela tively recent urban phenom enon known as shantytowns . These areas are com monly on unoccupied, low-value land in and around many urban areas in und erdeveloped countries. Shantytowns may contain over 50 percent of the total urban population. They usually lack streets and public utilities. The lean-to st ructures tend to be irregularly laid out, connected by walking paths, and made of any scrap material available: lum ber, brick, sheet m etal, cardboard, cloth, or vegetation. The random arrangem ent of structures, the absence of form al street nam ing and num - bering, and often the lack of easily identifiable buildings and terrain create challenges. These challenges include navigating, coordinating, and transmit- ting accurate inform ation and intelligence. Depending on the operation, the tem porary nature of the structures can also m ean that m obility can be either more or less restricted than other sect ions of the urban area. A military force may easily knock down and traverse st ructures without affecting m obility at all. However, their destruction may cause unacceptable civilian casualties, in which case m obility becom es m ore rest rictive as the narrow paths often do 2-13"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ not accommodate vehicular traffic. Sim ilarly, the makeshift materials inhibit weapons effects less than m any other parts of the urban area built more solidly. A tank round, for exam ple, m ay go much farther and injure many more noncombatants than in an area where the prim ary building m aterial is stone. Regardless, com manders consider the effects of their operations in this area, to include vehicles and weapons, as the weak structures increase the risk of fratricide, civilian casualties , and large, rapidly spreading fires. Commercial Ribbon Area 2-41. Commercial ribbon areas are rows of stores, shops, and restaurants built along both sides of major streets that run through and between urban areas. These sam e types of areas ofte n develop along the roads that connect one urban area to another (strip areas) . The buildings uniform ly stand two to three stories tall (about one story ta ller than the dwellings on the streets behind them). URBAN SOCIETY 2-42. Although intricate, understanding the urban terrain is relatively straightforward in com- parison to compre- hending the multifaceted nature of urban society. UO often require Arm y forces to operate in close proxim ity to a high den- sity of civilians. Even evacuated areas can have a stay-behind population in the tens of thousands. This population’s pres- ence, attitudes, actions, communications with the media, and needs m ay affect the conduct of operations. Hom ogeneity de- creases drastically as the size of th e urban area increases. Com manders take into account the characteristics of a population whose beliefs and interests vary based on factors. Figure 2-7 lis ts the factors. Civilian populations con- tinually influence, to varying degrees, operations conducted in an urban area. Thoroughly understanding these soci etal aspects and avoiding “mirror- imaging”—overlaying one’s own values and thought processes on top of the person or group one is trying to asse ss—will help to accurately anticipate civilian actions and response. ?

Key Aspects of the Urban Society POTENTIAL CENTER OF GRAVITY 2-43. A COG during an urban operation, particularly in stability operations and support operations, m ay be the ci vilian inhabitants them selves—specifi- cally their behavior. However, supportiv e behavior is generally an advantage in any type of operation. Corresponding ly, neutral behavior toward friendly 2-14"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" Urba n Env ironme nt forces is an advantage over hostile behavior. To influence or control their behavior, com manders first understand the society’s com plex nature and character. Second, they understand and accept that every m ilitary action (or inaction) m ay influence the relationsh ip between the urban population and Arm y forces , and, by extens ion, m ission success. Lastly, they understand that Arm y forces may play only a supporting (but essential) role as part of an inte- grated and synchronized m ultiagency effo rt focusing all aspects of national power. With this awareness, com manders can take one or m ore actions: • Coordinate and plan operations. • Im plem ent effective program s. • Take the im mediate action necessary to m aintain support of a friendly populace, neutralize or gain the support of hostile or neutral factions, or do any com bination of these activi ties to achieve precise effects and acco mpl ish the mi ssi on. Without this understanding, commanders increase the risk that their actions, particularly concerning the urban population, may not have the intended and necessary effects. 2-44. Although the factor of civil consid erations takes on added significance in UO, it is j ust one that com manders evaluate. Som etim es it may be the most im portant factor to consider as a COG. At other tim es it may be the least important as to be almost negligib le. Its im portance is not constant; it changes over tim e (like all factors). At the beginning of the operation, civil considerations may not be essential to mission accomplishment, but as the operation progresses this factor’s im portance to success may increase. In other circumstances, the opposite may be true. Overall, commanders consider three objectives regarding the civilians of the urban area: • Minim ize their interference with urban operations. In offensive and defensive operations this means moving them away from combat operations. In all operations, it ofte n requires centralizing them in one or more locations. • Maxim ize their support of Arm y, joint, and m ultinational forces and government agencies. • Observe the necessary legal, m oral, and hum anitarian obligations. GENERAL POPULATION SIZE 2-45. Urban areas are com- monly classified according to the general size of their population instead of land- mass. Figure 2-8 lists cate- gories of urban areas with their defining population. Categor y Population Village 3,000 or less. Tow n Over 3,000 to 100,000. City Over 100,000 to 1 million. Metropolis Over 1 million to 10 million. Megalopolis Over 10 million. Figure 2-8. Urban Areas by Population Size 2-46. These categories are useful to establish com monality and standardize terms that shape ideas, discussion, an d concepts. Sm aller populations usually suggest homogeneity among the inhabita nts. Homogeneity can make consen- sus or com prom ise easier to achieve because fewer opposing viewpoints exist. Given this homogeneity, effects of change are m ore certain and often easier to determine. However, homogenous does not mean identical. If major social 2-15"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ divisions do exist (either physical or ideological), com manders can m ore easily determ ine those divisions and their fundam ental causes with sm aller populations. 2-47. As urban areas expand, the urban patterns begin to blur and the social com plexity increases. For exam ple, as satellite patterns continue to grow, the LOCs between a central hub and outlying urban areas may develop and begin to assume a linear urban pattern . Simultaneously, a hub and outlying urban areas may continue to expand until they m erge into a single, large metropolis. On a larger scale, a network pattern can grow and unite as a single m egalopolis. This growth physically unites sm aller urban areas but cannot force conformity of needs and be liefs. It also increases the physical and social complexity of an urban area. GROUP SIZE, LOCATION, AND COMPOSITION 2-48. Understanding how specific elem ents of the urban society affect operations (and vice versa) normally begins with analyzing their size, location, and com position (see Figure 2-9). Because commande rs must minim ize civilian cas- ualties, size and loca- tion (without regard to com position) are im portant initial demographic consid- erations. After deter- mining the presence and num bers of civilians relative to decisive points, com manders can then decide whether civilian proxim ity and density represent a significant risk to their m ission—refugees clogging LOCs, for exam ple. If civilians are the prim ary focus of the operation, as in m any stability operations and support operations, this sam e analysis m ay help to determine decisive points. In this analysis, commanders consider that urban areas, on many levels, are in constant motion. The densities of circu lating people and other traffic often vary according to the time of day, such as rush hours and market times. In planning urban operations, commanders ma y need to consider the tim ing or rhythms of population and vehicu lar movements in the urban area.

Com manders determ ine the com posit ion of, or the identifiable groups or organizations within, the civilian urban population. Groups m ay be cate- gorized by race, religion, national origin, tribe, clan, econom ic or social class, party affiliation, education level, union m emberships, age, gender, occupa- tion, or any other significant social gr ouping. Physical and ideological over- laps (and divisions) often exist betw een groups. Overlaps m ay provide early focus for analysis and suggest ways to affect more than one group 2-16"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" Urba n Env ironme nt 2-17 simultaneously. In some cases, groups may have radically different ideologies but are (or can be) united by a single characteristic. Commanders understand the intricacies of “who does what to whom .” Such understanding furthers identifying the urban society’s sources of power, influence (both form al and inform al), and decisive points that hold the keys to controlling or protecting this potential COG. (See also the discu ssion of competing power structures in Chapter 3.) Commanders have expert, detailed, and current knowledge and inform ation to avoid developing sim ple formulas of social interaction that may actively mislead and add to a flawed course of action. LEADERSHIP AND ORGANIZATION 2-50. Com manders also understand how authority and responsibility is held or shared within and between each of the identified groups. For groups to exert m eaningful influence, leadership provides vision, direction, and organized coherence. This leadership ca n be a function of personality as well as organization. Som e groups depend on a charismatic leader to provide cohe- sion. Others de-emphasize individual leadership and provide redundancy and replacem ent in decisionm aking. Others com bine elem ents of both these types of leadership and organization. Based solely on personality, a leader may cen- tralize power or, while still being in ulti mate control, decentralize decision- making and execution to subordinates. In contrast, a single person may head a group while a ruling council actually makes and executes policy. Groups centered on one leader (which m ay or may not be the officially designated leader) can often produce decisions and initiate actions rapidly but are vulnerable to disruptions if key pers onalities are rem oved or co-opted. Groups with shared or redundant leader ship take longer to make decisions yet are more resistant to change and outside influence. INTERESTS AND ACTIONS Me and Som alia against the world, me and m y clan against Som alia, me and my fam ily against the clan, me and m y brother against m y fam ily, m e against m y brother. Somali Proverb 2-51. Identifying and analyzing groups also helps commanders focus on specific segm ents of the urban society to determine their beliefs , needs , and agendas . It also helps commanders determine how those interests motivate groups to future action (or inaction)— previous patterns of activity are critical in this regard. This analysis seeks to determ ine why groups (and their leaders) act as they do. Com manders con- sider political, econom ic, cultural, and re ligious factors in this analysis. These factors affect all groups to som e exte nt and often provide the basis for their beliefs, needs (actual or perceived), and subsequent behavior. Size and loca- tion considerations also apply to each group to help determine to what extent its beliefs or ideologies, needs, and actions m ay im pact the urban operation. However, size and proximity may not accu rately indicate actual or potential capabilities. Individuals, sm all groups , and groups located som e distance from the actual conduct of the urban op eration m ay be able to influence large portions of the population. These indivi duals or groups m ay have a capability disproportionate to their size and proxim ity—especially against objectives that are not terrain oriented (as in the case of m any stability operations)."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ INTERACTION, INFLUENCE, OR CONTROL 2-52. As shown above, commanders cultivate an understanding of a group’s— • Size, location (and proxim ity to operations), and com position (to include leadership and organization). • Interests. • Capabilities. • Potential actions (intent) and their effects—if any—on operations. Then they can develop or m odify course s of action as appropriate. Certain courses of action m ay be needed to im prove the interaction between Arm y forces and civilians (and between other agencies) to accom plish com mon goals. Others may be needed to influence favorable support, stabilize neutral groups, or neutralize hostile groups. Still others m ay require m ore forceful me ans to control and protect civilians. The latter can include establishing buffer zones and restricted areas; setting up checkpoints and roadblocks with other travel restrictions, controlling rations; enforcing curfews; inspecting facilities; conducting internm ent and resettlem ent operations; or m aintaining a “stay-put” policy. 2-53. Com manders rem ember that m any m easures will require significant resources that m ay initially be beyond the capabilities of the Arm y force to impose and enforce. (Where possible, co mmanders should attempt to use local law enforcem ent to accom plish controlling ac tivities.) The other elem ents of the environment, terrain and infrastructure , may fragme nt e fforts and make it difficult to consistently im pose contro ls throughout the urban area. A careful assessment of the urban society’s intere sts (beliefs, needs, and agendas) is essential before im plem enting any popu lace and resources control measures. Otherwise, inappropriate controls may only aggravate the situation. Finally, an appropriate course of action m ay re quire no specific action towards the urban society. In most cases, training and discipline, grounded in cultural understanding and sensitivity, will help m itigate many potential adverse effects resulting from m ilitary-civilian interaction. Soldier training should also include learning basic command s or phrases in the most common language to their AO. (Commanders sh ould review FM 3-15 and FM 3-19.40 for additional civilian control measures and considerations.) A CYCLE OF EFFECTS 2-54. Since the urban society is so dynam ic and the relationship between various elem ents of the society so compl ex, co mmande rs continually assess how their operations will affect the so ciety’s interests and intent and vice versa. Specifically, they assess how effectively their m easures im prove interaction with, influence of, and cont rol over civilians’ (see Figure 2-10). There is always a difference between inte nded and actual effects of a specific course of action. Nowhere is this m ore prominent than dealing with the urban society. This cycle of effects frustrates assessm ent during UO. T herefore, commanders continuously monitor these effects to make decisions and modi- fications while planning, preparing, executing, and transitioning UO. Initially certain aspects of the society, such as religion, may not affect the operation. However if the threat succe ssfully shapes the perceptions of the urban populace that Army forces are bias ed against them (or at least critical segments are affected by propaganda), this elem ent m ay becom e extrem ely 2-18"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" Urba n Env ironme nt im portant. In this instance, the urban co mmande r may ne ed to adjust his IO (to include PSYOP), public affairs (PA) activities, and CMO to counter this propaganda while diverting other combat power to control the populace. URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE 2-55. Urban infrastructures are those systems that support urban inhabitants and their econom y. They link the physical terrain to the urban society. Destroying, controlling, or protecting vital parts of the infrastructure can isolate a threat from potential sources of support. A threat force operating in an urban area may rely on the area’s water, electricity, and sources of bulk fuel to support his forces. This is true particularly when his bases or facilities are physically located in or near the area. Isolatin g this threat from these sources may require him to generate his own electr icity and transport his own water and fuel from outside the urban area. To transport supplies, the threat may rely on roads, airfields, sea- or river lanes, and rail lines. Controlling these critical transportation nodes may prev ent the threat from resupplying his forces. The control of key radio, television, and newspaper facilities m ay isolate him from the urban populace (another potential source of support). Figure 2-10. UO–Society Cy cle of Effects INTERDEPENDENCE 2-56. Commanders understand that destro ying or disrupting any portion of the urban infrastructure can have a cascading effect (either intentional or unintentional) on the other elem ents of the infrastructure. Yet, they may be able to gain an operational advantage while minimizing unwanted effects. Com manders can seize or secure an essential facility or structure by using precision munitions, electronic disruption of com munications, or SOF and conventional ground forces. To gain this advantage, com manders will rely more on the expertise of engineer an d civil affairs units, local urban engi- neers and planners, and others with infrastructure-specific expertise. After understanding the technical aspects of the area’s system s, they can develop the best course of action. SEPARATE PARTS OF A WHOLE 2-57. Hundreds of systems may exist. Ea ch system has a critical role in the sm ooth functioning of the urban area. Sim ple or com plex, all system s fit into five broad categories (see F igure 2- 11 on page 2-20).

Urban Infrastructure 2-58. As depicted in Figure 2-1, each elem ent of the infrastructure consists of both a terrain (physical) and human com ponent. For exam ple, the physical com ponent of the electrical segm ent of the energy infrastructure consists of power stations, substations, a distri- bution network of lines and wires, and necessary vehicles and repair supplies and equipm ent. T he hum an com po- nent of this same segment consists of the supervisors, engineers, linem en, and electricians who operate the system . Com manders understand and recog- nize the physical and hum an com ponents in their assessm ents. IMPACT ON FUTURE OPERATIONS 2-59. Destroying or incapacitating of any of these elem ents may im pact future operations and inhabitants of the urban area. Destroying urban infra- structure during initial phases of an operation m ay require com manders to assum e responsibility for repair, maintenance and clean up, and operation of those sam e facilities later. Althoug h exceptions will exist, com manders cannot destroy or significantly damage the infrastructure of a foreign urban center during operations and expect the population to rem ain friendly to US or allied forces. Still, support from th e urban society (albeit of increased im portance in UO) is only one factor that com manders weigh while develop- ing appropriate courses of action. RESOURCE INTENSIVE 2-60. Requirem ents to protect, restore, or m aintain critical infrastructure may divert substantial am ounts of resources and m anpower needed else- where and place additional constraint s on subordinate com manders. Civilian infrastructure is often m ore difficult to secure and defend than m ilitary infra- structure. The potentially large and sprawling nature of many systems (such as water, power, transportation, co mmuni cati ons, and go vernme nt) make their protection a challenge. Yet, the infrastructure of an urban area can provide com manders with essential logistics and combat service support. Therefore, the initial expenditure of tim e and other resources m ay be necessary to support concurrent or fu ture operations. Legal considerations, however, may affect using the infrastr ucture and acquiring the urban area’s goods and services. Com manders, their staffs, and subordinates (often down to the individual soldier) know their lim its concerning Arm y authority to com mandeer civilian supplies or equipm ent to facilitate m ission accom - plishm ent (see the legal support discussion in Chapter 9). In stability opera- tions and support operations, the safeguard or restoration of critical urban infrastructure for m ilitary or civilian use may be a decisive point in the overall operation. 2-20"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" Urba n Env ironme nt COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION 2-61. This system is com prised of the facilities and m eans to transm it infor- mation from place to place. It includes— • Telecommunications, such as teleph ones (to include wireless), tele- graphs, radios, televisions, and com puters. • Police, fire, and rescue communications systems. • The postal system. • Newspapers, magazines, and ot her forms of print media. • The human interaction that conveys information. Perhaps more than any other elem ent of the infrastructure, com munications and inform ation link all the other elem en ts in an interdependent “system of systems.” 2-62. Urban communications and informat ion systems can serve as an alter- nate for both friendly and threat fo rces and can be easily secured with civilian, off-the-shelf technologies. Th reats m ay m ake use of com mercial sys- tem s intertwined with legitim ate civ ilian users, m aking it unpalatable to prevent use of these assets. Forces can also use these system s to influence public opinion, gain intelligence inform ation, support deception efforts, or otherwise support IO. Increasing Impact of Computers 2-63. In m any urban areas, com puters link other elem ents of the urban infra- structure. They link functions and system s in the urban area and connect the area to other parts of the world. This latter aspect creates important implica- tions for com manders of a m ajor operation. Operations involving this cyber- netic function may produce undesirable effects on a greater scale than ini- tially intended. For exam ple, com manders m ay be able to close or obstruct an urban area’s banking system; however, this system m ay im pact the interna- tional m onetary exchange with unwanted or even unknown effects. The auth- ority to conduct these types of IO will of ten be retained at the strategic level. Whoever coined the phrase ‘ The Theatre of Operations’ was very prescient. We are conducting operations now as though we ar e on a stage, in an am phitheatre, or Rom an arena; there are at least two produc ers and directors working in opposition to each other, the players, each with their own idea of the script, are m ore often than not mixed up with the stage hands, ticket collectors and ice cream vendors, while a fac- tional audience, its attention focused on that part of the auditorium where it is noisiest, views and gains an understanding of events by peering down the drinking straws of their sof t drink packs. General Sir Rupert Smith Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe Pervasive Media 2-64. The media is central to the comm unications and information infrastruc- ture and a critical operational concern. Com pared to other operational envir on- ments (jungles, deserts, mountains, and cold weathe r areas), it has more access to urban operations. This is du e largely to airports, sea- and river 2-21"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ ports, and major road networks; ready access to power sources and telecom munications facilities; as well as access to existing local media struc- tures. Hence, media presence m ay be pe rvasive and IO even more critical to success in UO than operations in m any other environm ents. 2-65. A Complex Relationship. A com plex relationship exists am ong infor- mation, the public, and policy form ulation. Although the degree and manner in which public opinion shapes gove rnment policy are uncertain, negative visual im ages of m ilitary operations pr esented by the m edia can change polit- ical objectives and, subsequently, military objectives. As im portant, m edia reporting can influence civilian activity in an urban AO to either the advan- tage or disadvantage of the com mander. 2-66. Induce Cooperation Through Credibility. Commanders do not con- trol the media; however, they monitor the flow of inform ation that the news media receives and subsequently repo rts. Consequently, commanders plan and execute PA operations that will induce cooperation between the m edia and Army forces. Successful relation s between urban Army forces and the news m edia evolve from regular intera ction based on credibility and trust. More inform ation is usually better than less, except when the release of such inform ation may jeopardize security and the success of the operations and threaten the safety of soldiers. Howe ver, commanders cannot simply withhold inform ation to protect the com mand from em barrassm ent. They consider media interests as part of the normal planning process and work to ensure that information presented to the news media is accurate, timely, and consis- tent with operations security. Since the m edia will likely arrive in the urban area before the conduct of operations, early deploym ent of P A assets m ay be critical. Com manders synchronize P A activities with CMO and PSYOP . Such action elim inates duplicated effort an d ensures a unity of purpose consistent with the IO concept of support (see Chapter 4 for m ore details involving IO and PA during UO). 2-67. Failure to provide sufficient information can hamper a commander’s ability to conduct the mission. Poor relationships with the m edia can result in inaccurate and even biased reporting. Such reporting can cause a public reaction that influences the ability to achieve operational objectives. During the Russian 1994-95 battle against Chechen separatists in Grozny, for exam ple, the Russian m ilitary refused to com municate with reporters. The media reported primarily from the pers pective of the Chechen rebels. This encouraged both local and international support for the rebels. It also allowed the Chechens, who lacked sophisticated inform ation system s, to use the media to broadcast operational guidance to their forces. (During their second Chechnya campaign of 1999-2000, Russia learned this lesson well and the Russian view of the war dominated domestic public opinion.) On the other hand, successfully engaging the media can serve as a force multiplier. The Arm y’s open and responsive interaction with the media during peacekeeping operations in Bosnian urban areas helped to explain the challenges and successes of Arm y forces in the Balkans to the public. This helped m aintain dom estic, international, and local politic al support for NATO operations and, with a successful command information program , helped m aintain soldiers’ mo ral e. 2-22"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" Urba n Env ironme nt TRANSPORTATION AND DISTRIBUTION 2-68. This elem ent of the in frastructure consists of— • Cableways and tramways. • Networked highways and railways to include bridges, subways and tunnels, underpasses and overpa sses, ferries, and fords. • Ports, harbors, and inland waterways. • Airports, seaplane stations, and heliports. • Mass transit. • Trucking com panies and delivery services that facilitate the movem ent of supplies, equipm ent, and people. Similar to communications and informatio n, this facet provides the physical link to all other elem ents of the infrastructure. 2-69. Army forces deploying into a theate r of operations depend on ports and airfields; seizure of these assets m ay im pact the proj ection of com bat power. Once in theater, transportation and distribution systems in the urban area can contribute greatly to the movement of forces, maneuver, and logistic operations throughout the entire AO. Cont rol of decisive points in this infra- structure m ay be im portant to the m ilitary operation and to the norm al func- tioning of the urban area (and surrounding rural areas). Supplies traveling through the transportation and distribution system m ay be military-specific supplies (such as ammunition and repair parts) and supplies for both the military and urban population (such as food, m edicine, oil, and gas). The system may also support the m ovem ent of m ilitary forces and the urban area’s population (for which it was designed). T herefore, com manders of a major operation may have to develop innovative methods that limit the transit of threat supplies and reinforcem ents while facilitating the movem ent of their own resources and those of civilians’. This last consideration attempts to minimize hardship and promote normalcy in the urban area and will increase in significance as the need for legitim acy increases. 2-70. Most urban areas (particularly in developing countries) have two forms of transportation system s that exist sim ultaneously: a form al system and an inform al or paratransit system. Large organizations, bureaucracy, imported technology, scheduled services, and fixe d fares or rates characterize formal system s. Low barriers to entry; fam ily and individual entrepreneur organiza- tions; adapted technology; flexible rout es, destinations, and times of service; and negotiated prices characterize the informal system. The informal system is more decentralized and covers a mu ch greater portion of the urban area than the form al system . The inform al transportation and distribution system often includes a waterborne elem ent, is m ore likely to function through turbulence and conflict, and can extend hundreds of kilometers beyond the urban area. Accordingly, commanders assess both systems to establish effective movement control. ENERGY 2-71. The energy system provides the power to run the urban area. It consists of the industries and facilitie s that produce, store, and distribute electricity, coal, oil, and natural gas. This area also encompasses alternate energy sources, such as nuclear, solar, hydroelectric, and geotherm al power. 2-23"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ 2-72. Sources of energy may be tens or hundreds of miles away from the urban area itself. Therefore, com manders m ay exert control without applying com bat power directly to the urban area itself by controlling or destroying the source (power generation or refinem ent plant) or the method of distribution (pipe- or power lines). With electrical energy that cannot be stored in any sizable am ount, the latter may be the best means as most major urban areas receive this energy from m ore than one source in a network of power grids. However, control may be as simple as securing a power station or plant and turning off switches or rem oving a vital com ponent that could later be restored. On the other hand , lengthy pipe- and power lines may com pound security and protection of this elem ent of the infrastructure. 2-73. The number of nations that have invested in nuclear power and nuclear research is increasing. With this increase, the potential for Arm y forces to operate in urban areas that in clude (or are near) these facilities also increases. Dam age to one of these facilities and potential radiation hazards will present special challenges to com manders of a m ajor operation. To safeguard friendly forces and civilians, com manders will need to em ploy a blend of peacetime and tactical nuclear contamination avoidance principles (see FM 3-14). ECONOMICS AND COMMERCE 2-74. This system encompasses— • Business and financial centers to include stores, shops, restaurants, hotels, marketplaces, banks, tradin g centers, and business offices. • Outlying industrial and agricultural features to include strip m alls, farm s, food storage centers, m anufacturing plants, and m ills. The latter elem ents also consist of the production and storage of toxic indus- trial chem icals used in agriculture (ins ecticides, herbicides, and fertilizers), manufacturing, cleaning, and research (to include biological agents). (See concerns of TIM previously discussed under Industrial Areas.) Recreational facilities such as am usem ent parks, golf courses, and stadium s are also part of this elem ent of the infrastructure. In their overall assessm ent of this area of the infrastructure, commanders consid er the activities and influence of crim inal organizations or elem ents. 2-75. A critical aspect of this area du ring operations m ay be the political sensitivity of US or allied industries investing and operating in a foreign country, particularly during stability operations and support operations. An enem y or a disgruntled civilian population m ay attack or disrupt com mercial activities as a political statem ent agai nst the US or our allies. Food produc- tion facilities also m ay assist com manders in Arm y food services and may be of critical concern during relief operations. ADMINISTRATION AND HUMAN SERVICES 2-76. This broad system covers urban administrative organizations concerned with urban area’s public he alth, safety, and welfare. It also includes m any organizations and structures that provide the urban populace with its social identity. Together, it encompasses— 2-24"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" Urba n Env ironme nt • Governm ental services that include em bassies and diplom atic organi- zations. • Activities that manage vital record s, such as birth certificates and deeds. • The judicial system. • Welfare systems. • Schools and universities. • Religious organizations and their churches and shrines. • Historic monuments and other cultural resources. • Hospitals and other medical services. • Water supply systems. • Waste and hazardous m aterial storage and processing facilities. • Eme rgency se rvice s, such as po lice , fire , and re scue . 2-77. Losing m any of these services often has an im mediate, destabilizing, and life-threatening im pact on the inhabitants of the urban area. In stability operations and support operations, num erous adm inistrative and hum an ser- vices often rise to critica l im portance before all ot her elem ents. However, res- toration of these services is ofte n a lengthy civil-m ilitary operation. Seeing the Urban Area and Its Parts The summer of 1944 confronted German Gener al Dietrich von Choltitz with a dilemma. As military commander of greater Paris, he was to eliminate French Resistance internal to the city wh ile defending against approaching Allied units, missions for which he had insufficient forc es. Choltitz’s situation was further complicated by Hitler’s demand that he destroy the city, an action the general saw as needlessly destructive (and infeasible given his scant resources). Choltitz’s seniors directed the preparati on, and later the destruction, of Paris’s 45 Seine River bridges. They were the onl y remaining crossing points over that waterway given Allied bombing of others outside the French capital. Premature destruction would trap German forces def ending to their north, a second-order effect that Choltitz used to justif y his disobedience of orders demanding the bridges’ demolition. The German general also recognized that some mission-critical elements were part of Paris’s social rather than physica l infrastructure: the leadership of the various resistance groups and the relati onships between them. Choltitz under- stood that he lacked resources to def eat the many separate factions; he therefore chose the unorthodox (asymme tric) approach of accepting an inter- mediary’s offer of a truce with these groups. Such an agreement provided some measure of the stability needed while Cholti tz awaited promised reinforcements. Further, he realized that the resistance factions were by no means united in their goals. Communist elements sought a much different end than those looking toward a de Gaulle-led postwar government. A truce thus set the French Communists (who sought an uprising so as to legitimize their claims to power) against others trying to buy time until Alli ed forces arrived, forces that included Free French units supportive of de Gaulle. 2-25"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ 2-26 Although his defense of the capital fail ed, Choltitz succeeded in harboring his available resources, reducing the effe ctiveness of the resistance organizations fighting his soldiers, and maintaining wit hdrawal routes for units north of the Seine. The German commander’s analysis in support of these efforts was effective in part because of his insightful (1) identification of cr itical points that included elements of terrain, citizenry, and infrastructure; (2) understanding of the relationships between these parts; and (3) use of an asymmetric approach to address his lack of sufficient force to otherwise handle the densities that challenged him."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 Urban Threat . . .

Quadrennial Defense Review Report , 30 September 2001 As the strategic environment has beco me less stable, more uncertain, and more dangerous, Army forces are trained and ready to address urban threats. These threats range from re gional conventional military forces, paramilitary forces, guerrillas, and insurgents to terrorists, criminal groups, and angry crowds. Although uncertain about events, Army forces can be clear about trends. Increasingly, the Army will face threats that severely differ in doctrine, organizati on, and equipment, yet can fully in- teract with the three other components of the urban battlefield—terrain, society, and infrastructure. In stabilit y operations and support operations, commanders broaden their concept of the threat to include natural disasters, hunger and starvation, and rampant disease. Further, com- manders plan to contend with many passive urban threats, such as psychological illnesses and toxic industrial materials (TIM). These threats may be found in isolation, but mo st likely commanders will encounter them in various combinations. Moreover, each new threat will pose a different combination and likely have ne w capabilities that previous oppo- nents lacked.

An em phasis on asym metric m eans to offset United States (US) m ilitary capability has em erged as a significant trend am ong potential threats and become an integral part of the threat principles and tactics discussed below. Asym metry results when one opponent has dissim ilar capabilities—values, organization, training, or equipm ent—th at the other cannot counter. It is not a new concept. It naturally evolves from a sound m ission, enem y, terrain and weather, troops and support available, tim e available, civil considerations (METT-TC) analysis by an intelligent, freethinking, and adaptive threat. These asym metric approaches will include the m ost advanced, com mercially- available technology innovatively app lied and mixed with crude, simple, and unsophisticated weapons, tactics, techniques, and procedures. WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION 3-2. A chief asymmetric means of engaging the national power of the US is to em ploy weapons of mass destruction (WMD) against the US or its allies. These weapons can be used against m ilitary forces by m ilitary forces and include high-yield explosives as well as nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. Operations in urban areas may require concentrating forces and may create a lucrative target for a th reat that possesses fewer numbers and less equipm ent. 3-3. A threat’s WMD use will adversely affect the Arm y’s abilities to conduct urban operations (UO) to various degrees. F or exam ple, the intervening structures and the effects of urban microclim ates com plicate the ability to detect and identify radiological, chem ical, or biological attacks from a standoff distance. Also, the individual soldier’s ability to recognize his leaders, understand oral and visual commands, and operate increasingly sophisticated equipment is difficult wh en wearing protective clothing and equipment—particularly if his traini ng proficiency is low. Despite the increased challenges and complexity, Army forces have the training and equipment necessary to respond to such an attack compared to most armies around the world, but certainly when com pared to the civilian sector. 3-4. Although initial casualties could be high, the public can accept m ilitary casualties before those of civilians. Ther efore, threats m ay gain an initial tac- tical advantage but would achieve less asymmetric benefit by directly at- tacking Army forces. They may attempt to achieve an extraordinary asym- metric strategic advantage by em ploying WMD against US or allied civilian populations. In doing so, threats hope to use political sensitivity to high civilian casualties to reduce popular support for the US or its allies. The chance of these attacks occurring in an urban area increases because— • The area facilitates weapons’ effects and cam ouflages delivery m eans. • The dense civilian population ensures a high casualty rate. • The attack (or even the threat of attack) often will receive more publicity and public attention. • The urban area’s infrastructure is especially vulnerable to WMD, par- ticularly the system s of the econom ics and com merce infrastructure located in large urban areas, and may have far-reaching national and global effects. 3-2"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":" Urba n Thre at THREAT OPERATIONAL PRINCIPLES 3-5. The threat may apply several key operational prin- ciples to oppose Army forces operating in an urban envi- ronm ent (see F igure 3-1). These principles focus more on how a threat might fight in an urban area rather than specifically whom the threat might be or in what region of the world the conflict might occur. They are more effec- tive in an urban environment due to— • The high costs in time, material, and man- power involved in UO. • The lim iting effects of urban areas on many technological advantages.

These principles com plem ent and overlap each other; however, at their core is the need to defeat an enem y of supe rio r numbe rs, te chno logy, o r bo th. DENY ACCESS 3-6. The Army may not be located wher e future conflicts are fought. Thus, the Arm y maintains the ability to rapidly project and sustain com bat power over long distances and tim e spans. Th is capability dem ands that Arm y forces quickly gain and m aintain control of seap orts or aerial ports of em barkation or debarkation, particularly where the density of US basing and en route infrastructure is low. Com manders gain control of these ports by unopposed (assisted or unassisted) or forcible entr y operations. In either case, these phased-entry operations m ay present po tential vulnerabilities, particularly— • Unsuitable com position of initial or early entry forces lacking necessary combat power for i mmediate decisive operations. • Initial com mand and control difficulties and an im mature situational understanding. • Lack of developed theater support. 3-7. Consequently, threats may attack during initial force proj ection opera- tions to oppose, disrupt, or prevent the build-up of essential com bat power into a theater of operations. T hese attacks m ay occur anywhere deploying Arm y forces are located, at overseas bases, at home stations, and even in military com munities. Increasingly, depl oym ent facilities such as airfields and ports exist as integral com ponents of urban areas. Threats will invariably use the com plex and concealing nature of these urban areas, coupled with the vulnerabilities, to create favorable conditions for their attacks. 3-3"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ NEUTRALIZE TECHNOLOGY OVERMATCH 3-8. Threats will always strive to fo rce engagem ents at a tim e and place most advantageous to them . They m ay locate m ilitary forces and vital military c apabilities in urban areas to achieve sanctuary from the effects of Arm y capabilities and m ake Arm y forces and system s more vulnerable to less-sophisticated weapons. 3-9. T he clutter of the physical structures, electrom agnetic radiation, and population dim inishes Arm y capabilities. This clutter m akes it difficult for Arm y forces to acquire and effectively engage targets at long ranges. In urban areas, the terrain often allows a threat to operate in closer proxim ity to friendly forces. Therefore, the threat may “hug” friendly forces to avoid the effects of high-firepower standoff weap on system s and degrade their ability to gain or m aintain a thorough com mon operational picture. Additionally, this threat tactic attempts to inhi bit friendly com manders from em ploying some weapon systems and muniti ons for fear of fratricide. CONTROL THE TEMPO 3-10. Threats will try to achieve a de cisive advantage by setting and con- trolling the tem po necessary to achieve their objectives. To prevent the Army’s entry into theater, threats may try to create a high operational tempo to take advantage of the inherent weak nesses in power proj ection operations outlined earlier. As other efforts deny entry, threats m ay seize the initiative, achieve surprise, and exploit the tem po differential by attacking with heavy conventional forces potentially possessi ng greater firepower and more rapid ground m obility than the Arm y’s initial-entry forces. 3-11. If they cannot deny entry or en d the conflict quickly, threats may use any preparations m ade in the initial hi gh-tem po period to prolong the event, aim ing to degrade US or allied com mitm ent. The com plex nature of the urban environm ent slows operations conducted in and around these areas. Threats may maxi mi ze thi s characte risti c by fighting for key urban complexes and infrastructure, forcing friendly forces to operate within these areas. If Arm y operations focus on one or m ore urban areas, the overall cam paign slows. However, even when UO m ake up only one com ponent of a much larger cam paign, they may consum e valuable resources needed for other operations and delay the entire campaign. Tempo The battle for Aachen, Germany, in t he fall of 1944, developed during the US First Army’s offensive to breach the West wall fortifications. Aachen, the ancient capital of Charlemagne, had symbolic po litical and psychological significance for the Germans and Americans. Furthermore, it was the first city on German soil to face an assault by the Allies. Consequently, the symbolic importance of this first major battle in Germany ensured bitter resistance against American attackers. The Germans surrendered only after the city was destroyed. Expected to take a few days, instead, the battle took w eeks.

Many nations gain and m aintain dom estic po pular support to use their armies for political objectives. The threat m ay atte mpt to change the nature of the con- flict by modifying its strategy and tactics, the environm ent, or any com bina- tion, ultimately hoping to reduce fr iendly popular support. For example, introducing an urban terrorist threat to US civilians or soldiers not directly engaged in operations changes the nature of the conflict. This type of threat may not have been an initial consideration, and this change m ay reverse pub- lic support for the operation. Another exam ple, growing US coalition com bat power m ay cause the threat to switch from open m aneuver warfare to UO to avoid decisive combat with superior forces and achieve a stalemate. Origi- nally expecting a quick solution or vict ory, the political leadership may now envision a longer deploym ent with less chance of lasting success. CAUSE POLITICALLY UNACCEPTABLE CASUALTIES 3-13. Threat forces may gain an advant age against superior friendly forces by capitalizing on a perceived weakness of many Western nations: the inability to endure continuous losses or casualties for other than vital national interests or losses for which they are psychologically unprepared. A secondary US interest may equate to national survival on the part of a threat. Therefore, the threat (particularly with fanatical leadership) may willingly sacrifice excessive am ounts of m oney, equipm ent, and people (soldiers and civilians) to achieve victor y. Threats m ay attem pt to weaken US resolve and national will to sustain the deploym ent or conflict by inflicting highly visible, embarrassing, and if possible, large losses on Army forces, even at the cost of sim ilar losses to them selves. Many threat forces will use UO to inflict mass casualties and destroy premier Army weapon and inform ation system s. The physical characteristics of the urban environm ent support these ambush techniques. Light infantry or insurgents with readily obtainable, hand-held antiarmor weap ons can effectively attack armored vehicles and helicopters, no matter ho w sophisticated, in an urban area. ALLOW NO SANCTUARY 3-14. Threats will attem pt to deny Arm y forces safe haven anytim e and any- where. Terrorism may be one of the tactics used to deny sanctuary to Arm y forces. They will attack Arm y forces anywhere, particularly while operating in urban areas where the fear from bein g attacked from any quarter is often greater. Threats m ay be or em ploy stat e-sponsored or independent terrorists, well equipped and motivated to acco mplish their assigned missions. 3-15. Military buildings, facilities, and installations in urban areas are par- ticularly vulnerable to high-yield explos ive m unitions as well as other clever means to create large explosions. The close-in nature of urban areas, large populations, and high volum e of vehicle traffic provide a good environm ent for target reconnaissance, explosives po sitioning (conventional or high-yield), and cover for an attack. These attacks will likely be preceded by extensive, careful reconnaissance, necessitating a solid friendly counterterrorism and counterintelligence effort. 3-5"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ CONDUCT DISPERSED AND DECENTRALIZED OPERATIONS 3-16. To a certain extent, dispersed and decentralized operations are an integral part of all threat principles. However, this concept warrants separate em phasis as a principle since threat fo rces will likely place great significance on it on future urban battlefields. Both dispersed and decentralized approaches seek to reduce threat vu lnerabilities to air power and precision- guided m unitions (PGM) while increasing their agility, flexibility, and overall maneuverability in an urban environm ent. 3-17. Urban terrain tends to fragment an d separate forces that operate in it. Threat forces recognize this characterist ic, accept it, and m ake it work to their advantage. They conduct operations from dispersed urban locations to reduce their vulnerability to friendly decisive operations and m assed fire- power. Although separated, threat force s will attem pt to retain the ability to assemble and mass quickly so to strike as opportunities present them selves. Once threat forces com plete the operatio n, they will return to separate loca- tions to avoid potential counterattack. The fluidity and seem ingly disj ointed appearance of these threat UO will challenge friendly efforts to conduct tem plating and pattern analysis. Am bushes (air and ground) will be used to deny friendly ground and air reconnai ssance of their dispersed locations. 3-18. Dispersed operations normally de pend on good command and control to achieve synchronization and massed effe cts. Threat forces also understand the debilitating effects of the urban terrain on com munications and the exe- cution of operations. When they cannot mass their forces or effects, they will depend on decentralized operations to achieve their objectives. They will op- erate autonom ously, guided only by a higher authority’s purpose and intent. These operations m ake them even less vulnerable to massed attacks and PGM as sm aller threat forces do not present an objective or target that will allow friendly decisive operations. Ag ain, pattern analysis and templating will be extrem ely difficult. Using this pr inciple often prolongs the conflict but is central to implementing the other threat principles. URBAN THREAT TACTICS 3-19. Urban areas provide a casualty-p roducing and stress-inducing environ- ment ideally suited for using specific urban threat tactics. Moreover, urban areas provide threats with an unm atched degree of cover and concealm ent from friendly inform ation and firepowe r systems. While active urban threats may vary widely, m any techniques will be com mon to all. Figure 3-2 outlines a set of threat tactics available to potential threats opposing mission accom- plishm ent in urban areas. Army forces may use many of the threat tactics, except those that violate the law, ethi cs, and morals, to defeat urban threats . Moreover, using asym metric m eans is not the sole domain of the threat. Arm y com manders can also leverage cap abilities, create conditions, and plan operations to develop asym metric ad vantages to accom plish the m ission. USE THE POPULATION TO ADVANTAGE 3-20. Many urban areas may be too large to evacuate completely (if at all). Even if desirable, a m ilitary force m ay have no place to safeguard and secure the inhabitants. Therefore, future UO m ay see large segm ent of the populace 3-6"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" Urba n Thre at 3-7 rem ain. Offensive and defensive operatio ns may be constrained not only by the terrain and by the presence of m any civilians. Arm y forces involved in urban stability operations and support operations will certainly conduct missions in and amongst the resident s. These residents may restrict operations and, when gathered in la rge num bers, m ay (even without initial hostile intent) present a critical force protection issue for the com mander. Figure 3-2.

From the threat stand- point, the populace is sim ilar to key terrain: the side that man- ages it best has an advantage. Threat forces may gain this ad- vantage by using civilians as camouflage, concealment, and a m eans of deception. Guerrilla and terrorist elem ents may look no different from any other m ember of the com mu- nity. Many foreign conventional and param ilitary troops often have a “civilian” look. Western m ilitary forces originally adopted the clean-shaven and close-cut hair standards to combat disease and infection, but future oppo- nents m ay not adhere to those standards. T hey m ay adopt groom ing standards, civilian-looking clothing, and other “nonm ilitary” characteristics to m ake them selves indistinguishable from the civilians."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ Identify ing Soldiers from Civilians During Russia’s 1994-95 conflict with C hechnya, Russian forces had difficulty identifying Chechen guerrilla forces fr om Grozny’s noncombatant population. Because their appearance was identical to that of the urban populace, Chechen soldiers could freely walk around the city, suddenly disappear, and then abruptly reappear firing their weapons from basement s, windows, or dark alleyways. To distinguish fighters from peaceful city dwellers, Russian forces began looking at men’s shoulders to see if they were bruised (from firing weapons) and their forearms to see if there was burned hai r or flesh (from the extraction of cartridges). They closely examined their clothing and smelled for gunpowder residue. To identify a Chechen artilleryman, Russian soldiers checked for glossy spots left by artillery and mortar rounds on the bends and cuffs of sleeves. They also turned pockets inside out to check for a shiny, silvery-leaden hue indicating the former presence of small arms amm unition. Russian forces also recognized a grenade launcher operator or mortar man from fibers and crumpled pieces of gun cotton on their clothing. US Army commanders may need to develop similar, imaginative means to identify the threat. Gain Cover, Protection, and Increased Mobility 3-22. Threat forces may attempt to gain cover by using the urban inhabitants as hum an shields. With this increas e in protection, they sim ultaneously increase their m obility. They recognize the Arm y’s focus on developing and applying rules of engagem ent (ROE). They will take advantage of the restraining effects of international law and the Arm y ethical values to enhance their m obility in proxim ity to friendly positions. Knowing the Army’s reluctance to cause noncombat ant casualties and collateral damage, threats m ay operate in areas containing civilians and essential facilities to restrict the Arm y’s use of m assed or no nprecision firepower. They may also em ploy “rent-a-crowds”—civilians paid to dem onstrate against m ilitary forces—armed only with sticks, stones , and Molotov cocktails (a potential asym metric challenge). Mak e Moral Resp on sibilities a Weak ness 3-23. Depending on their successes, thre ats m ay use these tactics and skillful inform ation operations that attack national will and coalition sensitivities in an attempt to force the Army to estab lish more restrictive ROE. Threat forces may also take advantage of the Arm y’s m oral responsibilities. By herding refugees into friendly controlled areas, threat forces try to m ake the civilians a burden on the Arm y’s logistic and secu rity resources. Threat forces, on the other hand, may not abide by internatio nal agreem ents, such as the Geneva conventions. They may not take prisoners unless they can be ransom ed or made part of a local prisoner exchan ge. T hey m ay even execute friendly prisoners in front of the m edia to show their “strength” and, more im por- tantly, to cause friendly forces to ove rreact and lose their legitimacy. Threat forces can then use such an overreaction to unite others with their cause. Acquire Intelligence and Logistic Support 3-24. Indigenous threat forces can norma lly use the local population for intel- ligence and logistic support far more effectively than can an alien army. 3-8"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" Urba n Thre at Threat forces may manipulate local hire s serving among US soldiers, such as those contracted by the Arm y for bas e operation purposes or translator duties. In addition, refugees m oving through friendly controlled sectors may provide the threat with inform ation on friendly dispositions, readiness, and intent. Even friendly residents m ay becom e unwitting or unwilling inform - ants, providing an enem y or a hostile with vital inform ation on friendly activities, dispositions, and capabilit ies. However, a threat em ploying particularly cruel, abusive, or repressi ve measures may easily turn certain groups in the urban area against them , even when they share a com mon history, culture, and ethnicity with the civilians. This is m ore likely in those areas with high population densities. 3-25. Threat forces may also seek to use som e nongovernm ental organiza- tions (NGOs). They may try to obtain relief supplies either through the organizations’ legitim ate relief operatio ns or as a target for theft. Som e organizations may even be fronts for weapons, food, am munition, m oney, and fighters. For example, during Russi a’s second conflict in Chechnya (1999- 2000), documents purportedly found in Gr ozny by the Russians listed nations such as Sudan, Nigeria, Niger, and Ivory Coast as sending fighters to Chechnya under the guise of the Intern ational Islam ic Relief Organization. (Chechen fighters also disguised them selves as Red Cross workers.) This deception increases the need for stri ct security and force protection measures, close coordination with NGOs operating in urban areas, and closer monitoring of suspect organizations’ ac tivities by civil affairs personnel. WIN THE INFORMATION WAR 3-26. Threat forces will try to win the inform ation war as m uch as they will directly oppose Arm y UO. Threat urban cam paigns need not be tactical m ili- tary successes. They need only to we aken legitim acy and m ake the opposi- tion’s campaign appear unpalatable to domestic and world support. As a critical part of their overall inform atio n operations, threats will use the ever- present media to tell their story. Port able video cameras, commercial radios, and cellular telephones, available and easily concealed, will be as im portant to many threat actors as weapons an d ammunition. Internet access, already firm ly established in m any urban areas, provides the m eans to easily disseminate threat propaganda, misinf orm ation, and disinform ation through web sites and electronic m ail. Hackers, covered and concealed in the interior spaces of the urban area, m ay gain a ccess to US sites to m anipulate infor- mation to the threat’s advantage. Information and the Media The media coverage of the urban battle for Hue, South Vietnam, although only one of hundreds of different attacks of the Tet Offensive, affected the will of both the American people and their political leadership. On January 31, 1968, two North Vietnamese Army (NVA)/Vietc ong (VC) regiments and two sapper battalions, moving rapidly and with the element of surprise, attacked and seized part of the walled city (Citadel) of Hue. It was the third largest city in South Vietnam, the former capital of a unit ed Vietnam, the capital of Thua Thien province, and a spiritual and cultural center . Initially intending to hold the city for 3-9"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ seven days, the NVA/VC retained portions of the city for approximately three weeks against determined US and South Vietnamese attempts to retake it. Hue marked a revolution in the coverage of war by modern media. It was the first time Americans could sit at home and watch an ongoing battle on the evening news. One of the most intense and savage battles of the Vietnam conflict, it was televised every evening for almost a m onth. Although the battle for Hue was a tactical victory for the US, the Nort h Vietnamese clearly achieved strategic success by searing the American consci ousness with the high costs of urban warfare. Had US leaders made winning the information war a central part of the overall campaign plan—for example, exposing the American people to the NVA’s brutality by publicizing the civilian execut ions in Hue—civilian support for the war may have been bolstered and a different outco me achieved. See Chapter 6 for a more detailed account of the battle for Hue. MANIPULATE KEY FACILITIES 3-27. Threat forces will attem pt to identi fy and quickly seize control of criti- cal com ponents of the urban area to help shape the battlespace. Urban tele- phone exchanges, for exam ple, provide sim ple and reliable com munications that can be easily secured with off-the -shelf technologies. Sewage treatm ent plants and flood control m achinery can be used to im plem ent WMD strategies or to m ake sections of the urban area uninhabitable. Media stations significantly im prove the inform ation operations abilities of the controlling force. Power generation and transm ission sites provide m eans to control significant aspects of civilian society over a large area. USE ALL DIMENSIONS 3-28. Threats will think and operate th roughout the depth, breadth, and height (including supersurface and su bsurface areas) of the urban environ- ment. Conventional lateral boundaries will often not apply as threat forces control som e stories of the sam e buildin g while friendly forces control others. 3-29. Intrasurface areas and roofs provide urban threats with excellent observation points and battle positi ons above the m axim um elevation of many weapons. Shots from upper floors strike arm ored vehicles in vulnerable points. Basements and other subsurface areas also provide firing points below many we apo ns’ mi nimum de pre ssi ons and strike at another weakness in most armor. Sewers and subway s may provide covered and concealed access throughout the area of operations. EMPLOY URBAN-ORIENTED WEAPONS 3-30. Whether purpose-built or adapted, many weapons are more useful in an urban environment while others may have significant disadvantages. Urban threat weapons are much like the nature of urbanization and the ur- ban environm ent: inventive and varied. Many threats will integrate widely available off-the-shelf technologies into their weapon system s and arm ed forces. However, sniper rifles and sm all, m an-portable, fire-and-forget weapons and dem olitions and other im provised explosive devices will likely dom inate the urban environm ent.

Fav ored Threat Weapons 3-31. Threats may attempt to keep all or significant portions of Army forces engaged in continuous operations to increase their suscepti- bility to stress-induced illnesses. UO, by their nature, produce an inordinate number of combat-stress casual- ties. Continuous opera- tions exacerbate this problem. Threat forces that employ this tactic will often maintain a large reserve to m inim ize the psychological im pacts on their own forces. 3-32. To accom plish this, threat UO will likely involve decentralized maneu- ver, precision fires, and sim ultaneou s operations involving unconventional and special purpose forces. Threat forces will take advantage of any exposed weakness and engage in battles as opportunities present them selves. FOCUS ATTACKS ON SUPPORT AREAS, ISOLATED GROUPS, AND INDIVIDUALS 3-33. To supplem ent the previous tactic, threat forces will seek to target sup- port areas, small groups, leaders and their headquarters, and individual soldiers. Their focus on resupply, casu alty evacuation, and other sustainment activities, coupled with the compartmen ted terrain, navigational challenges, and multiple three-dim ensional avenues of approach often m akes these locations and soldiers more suscepti ble to surprise raids and ambushes. Attacks on these areas and groups are conducted to erode the Arm y’s ability to sustain UO, to inflict maximum casu alties, and to induce psychological stress. These attacks can be mitigated by careful, regular evaluation of choke points and other restrictive terrain, re gular awareness training for units and individuals operating in or transiting through potential incident-prone areas, and thorough after-action analysis of incidents. NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF URBANIZATION 3-34. Many urban areas are the engines for increased industrialism and eco- nom ic growth as an expanding population provides the labor for manufac- turing and service needs. However, rapid and inadequately planned growth can result in undesirable consequences. Uncontrolled urbanization may result in an infrastructure and econ om ic base unable to support the growing population. A large transient, ill-housed , and idle population in a close geo- graphic space m ay produce strife. Classes, cultures, ethnic groups, and races that might otherwise peacefully coexist can clash under the stress of sur- vival. Uncontrolled urban growth has resu lted in the negative effects listed in Figure 3-4 on page 3-12. In many urban stability operations and support operations, these may be the primary “threats” to mission accomplishment . 3-11"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ 3-35. Not all urban areas prevail as inher- ently unstable or hot- beds for unrest. Urban growth due to migration may remove sources of conflict, or it m ay provide the catalyst for violence. Com manders recognize the possible effects of uncontrolled urbanization. During their intelligence prepa- ration of the battlefield (IPB), they determ ine if these conditions exist. Throughout mi ssion analysis and the developm ent of courses of action, com manders consider the im pact (if any) on their opera- tions. At the same time, they recognize that UO may create sim ilar problem s that may affect the current operatio n as well as the overall campaign.

Negativ e Effects of Urbanization GENERAL INSTABILITY 3-36. Urbanization can enhance stability by generating industrialization and econom ic growth resulting in m ore j obs, a higher overall standard of living, and an educated, relatively satisfied populace. However, the population dy- nam ics associated with urbanization ca n also have an opposite, destabilizing effect. Radical population growth ma y create overcrowding and generate or aggravate resource and quality of life issues. Intense and destructive com pe- tition for em ploym ent, housing, and soci al status m ay develop in this clim ate of econom ic deprivation. The inability of som e governm ents to handle these problems— • Makes their urban areas potential sources of unrest. • Increases the likelihood of the Arm y’s involvem ent in stability operations and support operations. • Complicates operations conducted in such an urban environment. Weak civil adm inistrations have diffi culty controlling their society, safe- guarding their military arm aments, and preventing their urban areas from serving as sanctuaries to terrori sts and criminal organizations. 3-37. Urbanization in developing countri es warrants more concern. Their re- sources necessary for urban growth are scarce and the rate of urbanization disproportionately large. Between 1970 and 1993, the urban population of developed countries grew by 208 millio n compared to 910 million in the de- veloping countries of the world. Over the next two decades, developing coun- tries are projected to gain another 1. 6 billion inhabitants, 72 percent m ore than in the previous two decades. Figure 3-5 graphically portrays the widening demographic differences be tween the developed and developing regions. Each day, over 160,000 people in these developing nations migrate to urban areas. By 2015, 24 of the 30 largest urban areas may exist in the developing world. Intense migration and growth, coupled with the forced closeness of people once separated by the rural countryside, may stress 3-12"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":" Urba n Thre at already struggling institutions, hasten conflict, and lead to overall instability.

Urban areas with a large youth population m ay also help to generate conditions for instability. Rural-to- urban migrants tend to be relatively young. In 1999, Cairo, for example, had more than 40 percent of its population younger than 15 years. Young urban populations generate enorm ous dem and s for social resources, primarily education and j obs. Even a strong urban econom y m ay fold under the econom ic expectations of a trem endous influx of young migrants. Disorder and violence may result as hostiles (m any nonstate actors) easily m obilize and m anipulate the idle young to act politically and crim inally. Urbanization and population growth are m ore dangerous when they com bine to produce a cohort of young urban dwellers separate d from traditional social controls, such as village elders and clan leaders. 0 2 4 6 8 10 1996 2010 2030 205 0 Populatio ( b lions ) De veloped Re gion s Developing Re gion s Source: UN De par tment for Econ om ic and Socia l In formation an d P olicy An alysis Figure 3-5. Worldw ide Population Projections 3-39. Ethnic, religious, and other soci al issues may become the vents for anger and frustration produced by the hi gh tension of urban life. Major acts of violence and destruction, such as occurred in 1992 in India, can directly threaten a nation’s security. Army fo rces may have to conduct large-scale, stability operations and support operat ions to prom ote peace and protect national interests. In these cases, all levels of com mand will be particularly concerned with m aintaining im partiality and perceived legitim acy. Cultural and Religious Instability The 1992 bombing of the Babri Masid Mo sque in Ayodya, India, enflamed an already intense cultural and religious rivalry between Hindus and Muslims and led to rioting throughout many Indian urban areas. Of the 1,500 who died in conflicts and riots, almost 95 percent died in urban areas. The violence struck Ahmedabab and Bombay most seriously, wi th acts of murder, gang rapes, and arson occurring months after the destruction of the mosque. FOOD AND WATER SHORTAGES 3-40. Rapid urbanization, prim arily in developing nations, may lead to severe food shortages that could influe nce Army forces (or lead to their use). Such shortages m ay cause instability, m assive m igration, revolts, or increased support of armed opposition groups. Armed factions may target NGOs that supply aid as a means of furthering dissatisfaction among the populace. In effect, food m ay becom e a weapon. Deployed troops m ay need to 3-13"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ provide or support hum anitarian food ai d networks to keep the hum anitarian situation from escalating. 3-41. Norm ally, com manders should use centralized feeding centers as a last resort. Instead, Arm y forces should bring the food closest to the population to encourage civilians to stay in their hom es. If safe areas or cam ps are created, they should be designed for use over as short a time as is feasible. The general rule should be to return the ur ban population to their hom es as soon as possible. Army forces conducting dom estic support or foreign hum ani- tarian assistance operations that cannot maintain the safe food supplies may find the frustrations and hostility of the local population focused on them . 3-42. Water shortages (and quality) are becom ing a serious problem in m any regions. Com manders operating in an urban environm ent need to know the water supply origins and its treatment, purification, distribution, and vul- nerabilities. Before beginning operatio ns, com manders m ust know if they are providing water for the noncombatants as well as their own forces. Across the range of operations, controlling and protecting a lim ited water supply is, or may becom e, an essential operational consideration during UO. Food and Water Shortages Countries as varied as Indonesia and Alger ia exported their food surpluses only two generations ago but now import up to two- thirds of their basic staples. This cycle has resulted in many countries, which once exported agricultural products, facing the growing cost of imports to feed their urban populations. Estimates predict that by the 2010, at least 65 c ountries (including 30 of Africa’s 51 coun- tries) may depend completely on food impor ts. For some countries, it is even worse. Congo (Zaire), once a net food exporter, now faces mass starvation. Over the last four decades in China, irrigated farmland has tripled and urban populations have quintupled. In Indonesia, urban areas such as Jakarta may use six times more water in 2005 as it did in 1990, and Indonesia currently has limited capability to meet this increased demand. DISEASE AND POLLUTION 3-43. Urban areas frequently spawn epidem ics; therefore, widespread disease may pose a significant threat to Arm y forces that operate there. In many developing nations, rapid urbanization has occurred without a corresponding upgrade, expansion, or even developm ent of adequate sewage and water systems. Some urban areas have only one toilet for every 750 people or more. In these areas, hundreds of thousands live much as they would in poor villages, yet so confined as to ensure high transm ission rates for airborne, waterborne, sexually tr ansmitted, and contact-transmitted microbes. 3-44. In urban areas lacking adequate trash and waste management infra- structure, insect-spread diseases prolif erate. Mosquitoes that breed in pol- luted water, open water tanks, and irrigated urban gardens carry malaria and dengue fever—the leading causes of sickness and death from infectious disease in Latin Am erica and Africa. The problem com pounds with growing numbers of bacteria resistant to variou s antibiotics, a shortage of trained 3-14"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":" Urba n Thre at medical personnel, inadequate or insu fficient m edical facilities and supplies, and unclean agricultural and food-processing practices. 3-45. Pollution also creates critical heal th problems in developing areas and a potential health risk for intervening Arm y forces. Urban areas in China have recorded five to ten times the levels of sulfur dioxide found in the air of urban areas in the developed world. In parts of Poland, toxic waste has so polluted the land and water that ten perce nt of the babies have birth defects. Pollution m ay cause im mediate health problem s but more often, the insidious effects appear months or years after ex posure. As discussed earlier, UO may contribute, either intentionally or unintentionally, to an increase in pollution. Destruction of industrial com plexes that use, produce, and store hazardous m aterial m ay produce toxic gas and sm oke pollutants that contributed to significant health co nce rns to exposed so ldie rs. 3-46. Commanders initiate combat health support (CHS) planning early, in- cluding analysis of the medical threat and other critical medical information requirem ents during the IP B process. A m edical surveillance system m onitors the daily status of Arm y personnel thro ughout the operation. In preparation, all personnel receive a predeploym ent m edical examination. This exam estab- lishes an accurate baseline health status of the force and ensures that Arm y forces do not introduce new diseases to an urban area, possibly exacerbating the situation. Conversely, soldiers not immune to native viruses or possessing a weakened immune system du e to continuous operations and the stress associated with UO may put Army forces at a significant disadvantage. An outbreak of plague during an operat ion would have an effect similar to a chem ical or biological attack. The closer that Arm y forces operate to civilians (the humanitarian assistance operations conducted in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and Mogadishu, Somalia, for exampl e), the more probable that these situations may occur. See Chapter 9 for further CHS considerations. COMPETING POWER STRUCTURES 3-47. Many groups can exist that becom e strong enough to rival the power of the governing officials and eventually turn the urban area into a system of divergent and competing power structures. These groups can consist of insur- gent forces, a merchant class or an econom ic elite, crim inal organizations, or some other significant source of power such as religious organizations, clans, or tribes. In the absence of a legitim ate authority, armed factions headed by “warlords” may vie to fill the power void. Som etim es these groups or organi- zations, norm ally at odds with each other, m ay form alliances to achieve spe- cific goals. Com manders recognize, identify, and understand these alternate urban power bases and, if necessary, develop engagement strategies to neutralize or harness them to accom plish the Arm y m ission. Urban Insurgencies 3-48. As urban m igration increases in the developing world, rural guerrillas appear to follow. This transition of insurgencies from rural to urban areas oc- curs because urban areas offer a rich fi eld of targets for insurgent attacks. People im mediately notice any disrup tion of urban infrastructure, thus having great propaganda value. A conc entrated urban population is often more susceptible to propaganda and political organization. Insurgents can 3-15"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ easily arrange m ass dem onstrations using available com munications facili- ties, both overt and covert. Travel is effortless and large urban populations provide cover and concealm ent. On the whole, urban areas m ay provide a fertile environm ent for guerrillas to a pply their rural insurgent strategies. However, even with a rural-based insurg ency, operations in urban areas offer distinct opportunities to disrupt, di scredit, and demoralize the government (see FM 3-05.20 and FM 3-07). Urban Insurgencies In Africa, a strategy of capturing ur ban areas, while trapping government forces within others, has become a common tactic of insurgent forces. Similarly, insur- gents in Liberia concentrated their efforts in the capital city of Monrovia while guerrillas in Sierra Leone have battled t he government repeatedly for the urban diamond mining hubs. Even Shiite rebels in Afghanistan took their conflict with the government into the heart of Kabul, the capital. Merchant Clas s 3-49. Urban areas normally possess a merchant class or an economic elite as part of their social structure. In so me urban areas, they may carry more power than the local or central state governm ent. T hey m ay isolate them - selves physically and socially from the sprawling poor yet wield enorm ous power over the country’s political and econom ic activities. The degree of eco- nom ic separation between the m erchant class and the poor m ay be sm all but still socially or politically significant. 3-50. In a vastly impoverished area wh ere the econom y of the urban area is severely disrupted, the merchant cla ss will often continue to operate and function and, as a result, achieve a me asure of influence. To continue to operate under acute econom ic turm oil, they m ay form alliances in crim inal organizations and secure loyalties with in the government. Outside resources introduced into a crisis area (such as food, water, fuel, and pharmaceuticals) take on increased value, may replace currency as the medium for exchange, and often become the means to amass and hold wealth. One of the primary ways to obtain wealth may be to steal it. 3-51. In som e turbulent situations that lead to the need for stability opera- tions or support operations, com manders m ay harness the power of the merchant class as a force for peace and stability instead of one that uses crim e to achieve econom ic goals. For exam ple, in a relief situation, instead of competing with the merchant class by dist ributing food directly to the needy and possibly creating an environment of looting and black m arketeering, it may be possible to m onetize food. Food assistance from donor governments could be sold to merchants at an attr active price so they have a reliable source of supply. This could, in turn, create a healthy econom ic system and separate merchants from criminals and gangs. Criminal Organizations 3-52. Organized criminal groups have grown common in urban areas; have also become an important part of the urban social structure (gangs for ex- am ple); and can exert considerable influence on governm ents, people, and 3-16"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" Urba n Thre at military forces conducting UO. Som e la rge crim inal organizations relying on international connections often have better resources and equipment than their insurgent counterparts. Their large financial resources, long-reaching connections, and ruthlessness provide th em the m eans to corrupt or intim i- date local officials and government institutions. In any operation, but especially support operations, they m ay violently confront and oppose Army forces during m ission execution. 3-53. The tactics of urban criminal grou ps parallel those of insurgents. They have developed an intuitive cultural understanding of slum neighborhoods and the ability to lure civilians into crim inal activities. They have also mastered the m anagem ent of m obs. They recruit teenagers and young adults in their efforts against rivals and authorities, just as insurgents muster arm ies from the youth of rural villages. In m any developing nations, there exists an alliance between insurgents and organized crim inal groups. In these alliances, the insurgents defend the crim inals and the crim inals fund the insurgents. During many UO, partic ularly during or following combat, civil disturbances, or large natural disasters, looting (organized or unorganized) m ay becom e of critical concern. T herefore, UO m ay often require a com bined law enforcem ent and m ilitary response. Crime and Criminal Organizations Crime and poverty plague urban areas such as Rio de Janeiro, Brazil’s second largest urban area and would affect militar y operations conducted in their limits. Rio has some of the nation’s highest negat ive urban indicators: the largest num- ber of slum dwellers (1 million), the highest murder rate (1 of 700 residents per year), and the highest kidnapping rate (4 per week). In 1989, the homicide rate of the urban area was three times higher than New York City’s and the rate of urban violence continues to rise. Ther efore, law enforcement management may be a critical issue for Army forces operat ing in urban environments similar to that of Rio de Janeiro. However, criminal elements or organizati ons may not always work against Army commanders. They can be co-opted or in fluenced to serve friendly objectives. For example, during World War II the US Navy worked covertly with the Mafia in New York City to secure the New York harbor from German U-boats believed to be torpedoing ships there. The Mafia controlled most dock activities New York harbor and was perfectly positioned to m onitor other subversive waterfront activity. This capability provided needed information to the Navy for its counterintelligence and security tasks. Ne w York civil authorities therefore agreed to permit a Navy-Mafia alliance to operate at the port for the greater good of the country. Although the Mafia was not the preferred ally of the Navy, it had the capability to protect US ships and the interest (patriotism) to help in the war effort. In those circumstances, the te mporary alliance worked (see also the civilian threat discussion in Appendix B). Warlords 3-54. A characteristic of m any recent stability operations and support opera- tions has been the deterioration or com plete collapse of political authority in the country or urban area in crisis. In some cases, warlords have attempted 3-17"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ to fill the power vacuum (see Appendix C for an exam ple). These individuals often have no particular claim to legi tim acy. Their power issues from their weapons, not necessarily from their po litical skills, hum an services provided, or popular consent (although they have some popular support to remain in their relative position of authority). In dealing with these urban warlords during support operations or stability operations, it m ay appear that there are two options: either ignore them com pletely or work with them visibly or regularly. Commanders may reduce some of the greater risks involved in these extrem es by adopting a m iddle-ground approach. Nevertheless, the technique chosen m ust clearly support political and m ilitary objectives. 3-55. Refusal to acknowledge warlords may increase the threat to Army forces and NGOs. Their militias may atta ck Arm y forces to achieve recogni- tion or sim ply due to misunderstanding or inherent friction between arm ed forces. On the other hand, dealing with them may provide legitimacy to the exclusion of other elem ents of the urban population such as professional groups (for exam ple, doctors or teache rs), religious groups, and traditional clan or tribal chiefs—which may have a greater claim to legitimacy and better form the foundation for a reconstituted urban society. 3-56. A com prom ise between these two extrem es m ay offer the best chance for success. Commanders generally recogn ize these warlords or they risk incidents; however, this recognition can be kept at staff levels to avoid be- stowing any legitim acy on them . Instead, com manders them selves visibly meet the other elem ents of society that have a m ore legitim ate claim to politi- cal, social, or econom ic leadership. Inevitably, com manders m ay need to m eet with warlords. In those circumstances, cl an or tribal elders, and others who represent traditional authority should attend and com manders should ask for, and give deliberate consideration to, their opinions. 3-18"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 Contemplating Urban Operations We based all our further calculations on the most unfavorable assum ptions: the inevitability of heavy and prolonged fighting in the streets of Berlin, the possibility of German counter-attacks from outside the ring of encirclement from the west and south-west, restoration of the enemy’s defence to the west of Berlin and the consequent need to continue the offensive. General of the Army , S. M. Shtemenko describing the operational level planning for taking Berlin The Soviet General Staff at W ar In any potential situation and in any area, Army commanders will lik ely need to assess the rele- vance and impact of one or more urban areas on their operations.

UO may be the commander’s sole focus or only one of several task s ne sted in an even larger operation. Although UO potentially can be condu cted as a single battle, engagement, or strike, they will more often be conducted as a major operation requiring joint resources. Such action s result from the increasing sizes of urban areas.

Whether the urban operation is the major operation itself or one of many task s in a larger op eration, Army commanders assess and thoroughly shape the conditions so subordinate tactical commanders can dominate in the complex urban environment. NECESSITY OF URBAN OPERATIONS 4-1. Early in plan- ning, commanders of a m ajor operation address the necessity of conducting opera- tions in urban areas located throughout their areas of opera- tions (AOs). Chap- ter 1 discussed stra- tegic and operational considerations that compel forces to operate in urban areas. T hese reasons include the location of the threat force; cri- tical infrastructure or capabilities that are operationally or strategically valuable; the geographic location of an urban area; and the area’s political, econom ic, or cultural signi- ficance. Several considerations exist, that may make UO unnecessary, unwar- ranted, or inefficient. When determ ining whether to operate in an urban environm ent, com manders consider the operational (and accidental) risks and balance them with mission benefits. Th e factors shown in F igure 4-1 high- light some measures to evaluate the risks associated with UO. FORCE STRENGTH 4-2. When facing prospective UO, com manders consider if they have troops available to conduct the operation properly and with acceptable risk. Under normal circumstances, large urban ar eas require many forces merely to establish control. New York City police department has over thirty thousand officers simply to conduct peacetime law enforcement. Major UO, particularly those that are opposed, will often requ ire a significant num ber of forces. If commanders lack sufficient force to co nduct effective operations, they m ay postpone or consider not initiating those operations until they have the necessary strength. Commanders add to their analysis the requirem ents for troop strength elsewhere in the AO.

This consideration includes an assessm ent of their level of training 4-2"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" Conte mpla ting Urba n Ope rations in urban operations. All UO put a prem ium on well-trained, dism ounted infantry units . Therefore, Arm y forces conducting UO should be force tailored to include a large infantry com ponent. In addition, special operations forces (SOF) are invaluable in UO. SOF includ e psychological operations (P SYOP ) and civil affairs (CA) forces. They should always be considered as part of the task organization. 4-4. UO include combined arms to ensure tactical success in combat. Although masses of heavy forces are no t normally required, successful UO require all the com bined arm s capabilit ies of all Arm y forces. Even if an urban operation is unlikely to involv e offensive and defensive operations, field artillery m ay be essential to force protection. In urban stability opera- tions and support operations, successf ul m ission accom plishm ent requires more robust CA organizations. They are also valuable in urban offensive and defensive operations. While com manders m ay have sufficient com bat and combat support forces, they may lack en ough combat service support forces to provide the logistic support to maintain the tem po. Com manders without balanced types of forces, to include their proficiency in operating in urban environm ents, should consider alternatives to UO or delaying UO until proper force types are trained an d available in sufficient numbers. CASUALTIES 4-5. Casualties in UO are more lik ely than in operations in other environm ents. In urban offense and defe nse, friendly and threat forces often engage at close range with little space to m aneuver. T he urban terrain provides num erous advantages to the ur ban defender; higher casualties occur am ong troops on the offensive, where frontal assaults may be the only tac- tical option. Conversely, defenders with lim ited ability to withdraw can also suffer high casualties when isolated and attacked. Casualties can be m ore difficult to prevent in urban stabilit y operations and support operations because of the dense com plex terrain, th e close proxim ity of the urban popu- lation, and the possible difficulty in distinguishing friend from foe. T he potential for high casualties and the subsequent need for casualty evacuation under difficult circum stances m ake the positioning and availability of adequate medical resources anot her important consideration. 4-6. Though casualties occur in all operations, com manders recognize the likelihood of m ore casualties during large-scale or high-intensity UO. During the battle for Hue in 1968, for example, many company-size units suffered more than 60 percent casualties in only a few days of offensive operations. Com manders conducting urban stability operations and support operations know the casualty risk and how it relate s to national and strategic objectives. While a lower risk norm ally exists in stability operations and support operations than in offensive and defens ive operations, just one casualty may adversely im pact the success of the stability or support m ission. A realistic understanding of the risk and the nature of casualties resulting from UO critically affect the decisionmaking process. If commanders assess the casualty risk as high, they ensure that their higher headquarters under- stands their assessm ent and that the obj ectives sought within the urban area are commensurate with the anticipated risk. 4-3"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ MUNITIONS AND EQUIPMENT 4-7. Offensive and defensive operations in an urban environment put a pre- mium on certain types of munitions an d equipment. Forces may want to use vast am ounts of precision munitions in the urban environm ent. At the tac- tical level, they will likely use more munitions than during operations in other environm ents. These m unitions include— • Grenades (fragmentation, concussion , stun, rio t co ntro l, and smo ke). • Mortar ammunition (due to its rate of fire, responsiveness, and high- angle fire characteristic). • Explosives. • Sm all arm s. Soldiers need access to special equi pm ent necessary to execute sm all-unit tactics effectively. In urban stability op erations and support operations, this equipm ent m ay include antiriot gear, such as batons, protective clothing, and other nonlethal crowd control devices. In urban offensive and defensive operations, special equipm ent can includ e sniper rifles, scaling ladders, knee and elbow pads, and door busters. Soldiers can conduct UO with standard clothing and m ilitary equipm ent. However, failure to equip them with the right types and quantities of m unitions and special equipm ent will make mission success more difficult and costly. When commanders consider whether to conduct UO, they evaluate the ability of com bat service support to provide the resources (see Chapter 9). COLLATERAL DAMAGE 4-8. UO require an expanded view of risk assessm ent. When considering risk to Arm y, joint, and m ultinational forces, com manders analyze the risk to the area’s population and infrastructure. This com prehensive analysis includes the second- and third-order effects of significant civil casualties and infra- structure dam age. Collateral dam age can influence world and domestic opinion of m ilitary operations and thus directly affect ongoing operations. It also influences the postconflict physic al environment and attitudes of the population. Negative im pressions of the civilian population caused by col- lateral damage can take generations to overcome. Destroying an urban area to save it is not a viable course of action for Arm y com manders. The density of civilian populations in urban areas and the m ultidim ensional nature of the environm ent make it m ore likely that even accurate attacks with precision weapons will injure noncom batants. Unavoidable collateral dam age of suffi- cient m agnitude m ay justify avoiding UO, which, though it may be tactically successful, may run counter to nati onal and strategic objectives. TIME AND MOMENTUM 4-9. Commanders conducting major operat ions analyze the time required to conduct UO successfully. UO can be ti me consuming and can require large quantities of resources. The density of the environm ent, the need for addi- tional time to conduct a thorough reconnaissance, and the additional stress and physical exertion im posed on Arm y forces operating in urban areas con- sume time and sl ow mo me ntum. C omma nders cannot permit UO conducted as a shaping operation to divert resou rces from the decisive operation. Nor can they allow UO to interrupt critica l time lines, unnecessarily slow tempo, 4-4"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" Conte mpla ting Urba n Ope rations or delay the overall operation. Threat forces m ay conduct UO with the pri- mary purpose of causing these effects. Com manders should avoid or m inim ize UO that m ight delay or disrupt a larger operation to an unacceptable degree. VULNERABILITIES 4-10. Com manders weigh the potential for increased vulnerabilities when executing UO. The density of the enviro nm ent m akes protection (safety, field discipline, force protection, and especially fratricide avoidance) m uch m ore difficult. Forces operating in a large urban area increase their risk of isolation and defeat in detail. Joint cap abilities, such as air power, work less effectively to support a close urban ba ttle than in som e other environm ents. Thus, responding to unexpected situat ions or augm enting disadvantageous force ratios when applying joint capab ilities is significantly m ore difficult. Although organized, trained, and equi pped for success in any environment, the Arm y vulnerability to weapons of m ass destruction (WMD) increases when forces concentrate to conduc t UO. Commanders may consider not com mitting forces or lim iting the size of a force committed to an urban area because of increased vulnerability to (and likelihood of) attack by WMD. 4-11. Fratricide avoidance is a matte r of concern for commanders in all operations. The com plex urban terrain and density of participating forces coupled with typical battlefield effe cts—smoke, dust, burning fires—and weather effects—fog, snow, rain, an d clouds—im mensely increase the poten- tial for urban fratricide. Therefore, com manders increase em phasis on fratri- cide prevention m easures during UO. Ca uses can be procedural, technical, or a com bination of the two and include— • Com bat identification failures due to poor situational understanding, lack of com munication, and short engagem ent ranges coupled with the need for quick reaction. • Location errors involving either the target or enem y forces due to poor situational understanding. • Inappropriate command and control an d fire support coordinating mea- sures; a failure to receive, understand, or adhere to these m easures. • Imprecise weapons and munitions effects such as, an antitank round that penetrates several walls before exploding near friendly forces. 4-12. The effects of fratricide can be devastating to UO and spread deeply within the Arm y force. Critical effects include— • Needless loss of combat power. • Decreased confidence in leadership, weapons, and equipm ent. T hese lead to a loss in initiative and aggr essiveness, failure to use supporting com bat system s, and hesitation to conduct lim ited visibility operations. • Disrupted operations and decreased tempo. • General degradation of cohesion and morale. ESCALATION 4-13. In the urban environm ent, Arm y forces cannot avoid close contact with enem y forces and civilians that m ay po tentially becom e hostiles. In urban stability operations and support operat ions, com manders consider the chance of this contact escalating into confro ntation and violence, which may become 4-5"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ destabilizing. This consideration m ay lim it or altogether preclude UO using Army forces. CONSIDER ALTERNATIVES AND RISK REDUCTION MEASURES 4-14. Since UO are often high risk, co mmanders should consider courses of action that provide alternatives. When the obj ective of an urban operation is a facility, com manders should consider re plicating that facility outside of the urban area. For example, a critical requ irem ent for an airfield to sustain operations m ay lead com manders to co nsider UO to seize or secure one located in an urban area. However, if adequate resources exist, Army forces may build an airfield outside of the urban area and elim inate the need to conduct the urban operation. Similarly, logistics over-the-shore operations may be an alternative to seizing a port facility. In som e situations, the objec- tive of UO m ay be to protect a political organization such as a governm ent. Relocating the governm ent, its institutio ns, and its personnel to a safer area may be possible. Commanders can also de sign an operation to avoid an urban area. For example, if an urban area dominates a particular avenue of approach, use a different avenue of appr oach. This differs from isolating and bypassing because the entire operation specifically m akes the urban area irrelevant. 4-15. If com manders execute UO, they assess potential hazards, and then they develop controls to either elim inat e or reduce the risks to Army forces. The first m eans to offset risk is alwa ys to ensure a thorough understanding of the urban environm ent and its effects on operations by all members of the force. Other measures to bring risk to acceptable levels m ay include— • Detailed planning to include thorough intelligence preparation of the battlefield and appropriate branches and sequels. • Integrated, accurate, and tim ely intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR). • Clear m issions and intent, which includes a well-articulated end state. • Sufficient reserves and rotation of forces. • Vigilant physical security precaution s to include increased use of bar- riers and other defenses, particular ly when urban areas are used as support areas. • Operative communications and other information systems (INFOSYS). • Effective populace and re sources control measures. • Com prehensive and flexible rules of engagement (ROE) continuously reviewed to ensure they rem ain adequate for the situation. • Sufficient command and control measures and standard marking and identification techniques. Measures should allow com manders to satis- factorily control UO and minimize fratricide without unreasonably restricting subordinate com manders’ ability to accom plish assigned missions. • Proper targeting procedures (includi ng effective fire support coordina- ting m easures and a stream lined legal review of targets), positive iden- tification of targets, and controlle d clearance of fires. T he goal is achievem ent of precise (yet rapid) effects with both lethal and nonlethal means. 4-6"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":" Conte mpla ting Urba n Ope rations • Well-synchronized inform ation operatio ns (IO) that begin before intro- ducing Army forces into the urban environment and well through tran- sition. Com manders em phasize vigilant operations security (OP SEC) particularly when operating closel y with nongovernm ental organiza- tions (NGOs) and elem ents of the civilian population. • Active and effective integrating, synchronizing, and coordinating am ong all forces, agencies, and organizations involved in the operation. • Responsive, sustainable, and flexib le urban combat service support. • Forces well trained in joint, m ultin ational, and com bined arm s UO. • Thorough after-action analyses cond ucted during actual operations as well as after training exercises. A system exists to allow hard-won, lessons learned and tactics develope d to be immediately passed on to other units and soldiers—even in the m idst of an operation. CHARACTERISTICS OF MAJOR URBAN OPERATIONS JOINT 4-16. Major UO are inherently joint. Ma jor United States (US) UO conducted since World War II have all included m ultiple services. Often, they may include a multinational component (see Figure 4-2 on page 4-8). Joint urban operations (JUOs) in which Arm y forces are a m ajor com ponent will be land operations. T hese operations m ay take place within the context of a j oint campaign conducted by a joint force land com ponent com mander or a j oint task force (JT F) com mander. Or they m ay be an Arm y operation under an ARF OR com mander who him self operates for a JF C, depending on the organization of the theater’s joint command structure. In the later case, the JFC will m anage joint issues in the urban area. 4-17. The JFC conducting JUOs will focu s on effectively organizing his forces for UO and tasking them in accordance with their service capabilities. His guide for the conduct of the JUO will be the joint operational tasks described in JP 3-0. JP 3-06 will provide th e JTF com mander specific guidance regarding the conduct of j oint operational tasks in the urban environm ent. Arm y com manders will execute tasks assigned by the JFC and advise him on using Arm y forces and capabilities. Arm y com manders will also ensure that Arm y UO are nested within the JF C’s concept of operations. Also, the ARFOR com mander will request support through the JFC from other service and functional com manders who have urban capabilities critical to the success of Army UO. See Appendix D for more information on joint capabilities in an urban environm ent. FULL SPECTRUM OPERATIONS 4-18. Arm y forces will conduct the full range of operations across the spec- trum of conflict within urban areas. The situation will mandate that one type of operation  offense, defense, stability, or support  dominates the urban operation. However, com manders will often find them selves executing all types of operations—often sim ultaneously. The m ission determ ines the dom i- nant type of operation, with the other types of Arm y operations conducted to shape the AO for mission success. 4-7"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ SEOUL, K ORE A 1 950 (N A VY ) HUE, R EPU BLIC OF VI ET NAM, 1968 Note: O nly SH A DED uni ts actually co nducted U O in an d ar ound Hu e OPER ATION JUST C AUSE, PA NAMA 1 989 82 XX (– ) 16 X MP 470 X MI 525 X (– ) MI 96 I I CA 1 XX (– ) CO SC OM 110 9 X AIR FO R CES PA NAMA (J O INT ) (N A VY ) (AIR F ORCE ) (A R M Y) (A R M Y) (A R M Y ) Naval g unf ire suppo rt prov ided by the gu ided m issi le d estroyer USS Ly nde M cCorm ic AD VISOR 3M ACV HQ AR VN HQ I XX X (A RV N) I XX (A RV N) (+ ) (J O IN T ) (A R M Y ) XX 1 7 TA C AI R X CO RP S (ARM Y) (M ARINE) (M ARI NE /NAV Y) 17 (R O K) 32 (U S) I I I 7 5 1 I I I (M ac A rt h ur) XXX 10 (A R M Y ) HQ CINC F E HQ US S S icily USS B adoe ng Strait X CO RP S TR OOPS XX (– ) AT S EA: 12 ASHO RE 33 M AG I I I I I I JTF XX X SO UTH TF X-R AY XX 1 (– ) I I I 1 I I 25 I I 1 5 I I 1 1 35 X (– ) 4 I I I (– ) XX 7 (– ) L NA VA L FO R CES PA NAMA SE MPER F I I I (M A R IN E) X AT LANT IC X AV IATIO N XX PA CIFIC JS OTF X BA YONET (J O INT ) HQ MA CV FW D HQ MA CV (J O IN T ) (JOINT ) (M ARI NE) (A RMY) 21 2 C AV I I I I 5 7 CA V I I 17 C AV XX 1 X 1 (– ) LA NDING CR AF T (M AG ) (M AG ) SEOUL, K ORE A 1 950 (N A VY ) HUE, R EPU BLIC OF VI ET NAM, 1968 Note: O nly SH A DED uni ts actually co nducted U O in an d ar ound Hu e OPER ATION JUST C AUSE, PA NAMA 1 989 82 XX (– ) 16 X MP 470 X MI 525 X (– ) MI 96 I I CA 1 XX (– ) CO SC OM 110 9 X AIR FO R CES PA NAMA (J O INT ) (N A VY ) (AIR F ORCE ) (A R M Y) (A R M Y) (A R M Y ) Naval g unf ire suppo rt prov ided by the gu ided m issi le d estroyer USS Ly nde M cCorm ic AD VISOR 3M ACV HQ AR VN HQ I XX X (A RV N) I XX (A RV N) (+ ) (J O IN T ) (A R M Y ) XX 1 7 TA C AI R X CO RP S (ARM Y) (M ARINE) (M ARI NE /NAV Y) 17 (R O K) 32 (U S) I I I 7 5 1 I I I (M ac A rt h ur) XXX 10 (A R M Y ) HQ CINC F E HQ US S S icily USS B adoe ng Strait X CO RP S TR OOPS XX (– ) AT S EA: 12 ASHO RE 33 M AG I I I I I I JTF XX X SO UTH TF X-R AY XX 1 (– ) I I I 1 I I 25 I I 1 5 I I 1 1 35 X (– ) 4 I I I (– ) XX 7 (– ) L NA VA L FO R CES PA NAMA SE MPER F I I I (M A R IN E) X AT LANT IC X AV IATIO N XX PA CIFIC JS OTF X BA YONET (J O INT ) HQ MA CV FW D HQ MA CV (J O IN T ) (JOINT ) (M ARI NE) (A RMY) 21 2 C AV I I I I 5 7 CA V I I 17 C AV XX 1 X 1 (– ) LA NDING CR AF T (M AG ) (M AG ) FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ 4-8 Figure 4-2.

Against a large conventional enemy in a major urban area with a large civil population present, offensive op erations require the greatest com mit- ment of Army resources. They also en tail the greatest risks to Army forces and noncom batants. Within defensive or stability operations, forces m ay conduct tactical offensive UO, such as counterattacks to maintain the initia- tive or raids to elim inate elem ents disrupting the stability operation. Defense 4-20. Defensive UO are generally conduc ted as a shaping operation within a larger major operation. These tem porar y operations often set conditions for successful offensive operations, stabilit y operations, or support operations. Commanders conduct defensive UO within other types of operations to pro- tect essential facilities in the urban area, protect flanks against counter- attack, prevent the breakout of isolat ed enem ies, or protect valuable supply bases or vulnerable convoy routes. Arm y forces conducting defensive UO use the environm ent to enhance their com bat power. Stability 4-21. Stability operations in an urban environm ent require offensive, defen- sive, and support operations, com bined with other tasks unique to each sta- bility operation. Arm y forces conduct urban stability operations for various reasons, including noncombatant evacuati on operations, peace operations, or support to insurgencies (see Chapter 8). Urban stability operations will re- quire an offensive capability to destro y any m ilitary capability that overtly threatens its objectives before that m ilitary threat can adversely affect the operation. Arm y forces em ploy defensiv e capabilities to safeguard them selves as well as secure critical places, popula tions, or infrastructure in the urban area. Com manders m ay also em ploy defe nsive capabilities to separate and protect one faction from another. Various stability tasks require urban sup- port operations, such as distributing food or aid and protecting or assisting agencies conducting econom ic or hum anitarian activities. Support 4-22. Army support operations in an urban environm ent aid other agencies either in dom estic em ergencies or for hum anitarian relief. Support operations require the equipm ent, pers onnel, or organizational abilities of Arm y forces rather than the Arm y’s com bat capabilities. In a support mission, these capabilities often involve Arm y transportation, m edical, quarterm aster, or engineer forces. Although urban support operations may seldom require combat, commanders dete rm ine if hostile threats exist that could ham per Arm y support operations . Defensive and offensive capabilities may be required to mitigate threats to support operations. In addition, the em ergency that prom pts the need for Arm y support operations m ay require stability, offensive, or defe nsive operations to shape the situation so units can execute support tasks. 4-9"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ INTEGRATION INTO LAND OPERATIONS 4-23. The commander of the major operation, after determining that urban operations are required, then integrates the urban operation into his overall operation. He does this by articulating his intent and concept for the urban operation to his subordinates. T he com mander of the major operation also sets the conditions for successful tact ical urban operations by his subordi- nates. He defines ROE, focuses ISR effo rts, task organizes his capabilities, ensures inform ation superiority, designs the operational fram ework, and coordinates with other agencies (see F M 6-0). CONCEPT OF THE OPERATION 4-24. The com mander’s concept of the operation should address all opera- tionally im portant urban areas in his AO. It articulates his vision of the urban operation through directions to his staff and subordinates. Subordinate com manders address urban areas that the higher com mander does not specifically address. The com mander’s concept discusses each urban area in terms of task and purpose (see FM 101-5). The commander also describes his vision of the situ ation’s end state in terms of— • The thre at. • The urban environm ent (terrain, society, and infrastructure). • Friendly forces. • The conditions necessary to transition control of urban areas within his AO to another agency or back to legitim ate civilian control. RULES OF ENGAGEMENT 4-25. National- or joint-level comma nd authorities m ay develop urban- specific ROE. If not, Arm y com manders, as part of their assessment, deter- mine if urban-specific ROE are required for their situation and provide sup- plem ental ROE. However, com manders fo rward any conflicts or incongruities to their higher headquarters for immediate resolution. 4-26. Developing effective ROE relies on thoroughly understanding the national and strategic environm ent and obj ectives. It also relies on under- standing how to conduct urban operations at the tactical level including weapons effects. For exam ple, broad ROE m ay result in significant collateral dam age and civilian casualties. Even in a m ajor theater war (MTW), signifi- cant collateral damage caused during UO can make postcombat operations difficult. Such dam age m ay even change national and international public opinion or threaten the achievem ent of national and strategic obj ectives. In contrast, restrictive ROE can hamper tactical operations causing mission failure, higher friendly casualties, or both. ROE are often part of essential elem ents of friendly inform ation (EEFI) , protected to reduce the potential for threat exploitation. Even in a lim ited urban operation, ROE will frequently need to change as circum stances warrant. T herefore, com manders should plan ROE “branches” for anticipated changes in the operational environm ent. 4-27. In urban operations, ROE are flexible, detailed, and understandable. They should preclude the indiscrim inate use of deadly force while allowing soldiers latitude to finish the missi on and defend them selves. ROE should recognize that the urban area is not homogenous and may vary according to 4-10"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" Conte mpla ting Urba n Ope rations the key elem ents of the threat and environm ent: terrain, society, and infrastructure. To be effective, ROE ar e consistent throughout the force (an increased challenge in m ultinational urban operations), and soldiers are thoroughly trained and fam iliar with them . Enemy Effects 4-28. The nature of an urban enemy affects ROE as well. Commanders consider the type of enem y weapon system s, the degree of defensive prepa- ration, the ability to target enem y vuln erabilities with precision system s, and the ability to distinguish com batant from noncom batant. Terrain Effects 4-29. ROE may vary according to the terrain or physical attributes of an urban area. Physical factors m ay drive the ROE to preclude certain types of munitions. For exam ple, if the construction of a portion of the area is sensi- tive to fire, then ROE m ay preclude using incendiary m unitions in that area. The ROE m ay lift this prohibition when units move into areas of mason con- struction. Toxic industrial chemicals or radiological contaminants in an industrial area may also affect ROE. Societal Effects 4-30. The societal or hum an dim ension of the urban environm ent will often affect ROE the m ost. Com manders base the ROE developm ent on a thorough understanding of the civilian population and threat. They evaluate the loyalty of the population, its dynam ic involvem ent in activities that affects the operation, and its size and physical location. A population that is present and supports Arm y forces will likely elicit m ore restrictive ROE than a hostile population actively supporting forces opposing the Army forces. A neutral population, not actively involved in be havior affecting Army forces, supports consideration of more restrictive ROE. In all cases, ROE conform s to the law of war. However, ROE may be much more restrictive than the law of war requires. 4-31. The location of the population also affects ROE. The evacuation or con- solidation of noncombatants into contro lled, safe areas m ay result in less restrictive ROE. An allied population that rem ains in the urban area con- ducting routine business in and amongst Army forces during noncombat UO will norm ally require the m ost stringent ROE. Infrastructure Effects 4-32. Commanders consider the urban infrastructure when developing ROE. An urban infrastructure vital to current or future Army operations may dictate that com manders adj ust ROE to ensure that critical elem ents of the infrastructure remain intact during th e conduct of operations. If Arm y forces conduct an urban operation to capture port facilities, the ROE address dam age to the key facilities that are the objective of the operation. 4-11"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ RESOURCE ALLOCATION 4-33. Commanders of a major operation ensure that subordinate tactical commanders have the resou rces necessary to conduct UO effectively. T hey assign appropriate forces to subordin ate com manders tasked to conduct UO; support them with Arm y forces at the operational level; and request and coordinate their support by joint resources. Task Organization 4-34. Task organizing subordinate units for urban operations depends largely on the nature of the operation. Som e units, however, are always part of the task organization to ensure the success of UO. Infantry, CA, aviation, military police, PSYOP, m ilitary in telligence, and engineers are units required for all urban operations acro ss the full range of Arm y operations. Other type forces—such as arm or, ar tillery, and chem ical—have essential roles in specific types of urban operations but are less applicable across the range of Arm y operations. Com manders and staffs of a major operation understand their m ission, the particular urban environm ent in which they operate, and the general effects of the environm ent across the battlefield operating system s (BOS) to allocate the appropriate forces to their tactical commanders. See Chapter 5 for details. Operational-Level Support 4-35. Commanders of a major operation also support the tactical commander with forces remaining under their dire ct control. These forces can include Army SOF, such as CA, PSYOP, and Sp ecial Forces, ground and air cavalry, aviation, logistics, engineers, and com munications support. These forces m ay not be under operational control of th e supported command, but their efforts are synchronized and coordinated. Coordinating and Reques ting Joint Support 4-36. Commanders of a major operation provide forces to the JFC as well as receive assets. They also coordinate fo r and integrate joint assets to support the tactical battle. These assets will usually include air support, such as close air support, tactical airlift, and aerial reconnaissance and surveillance. Intel- ligence support comes in the form of reachback to strategic and national intelligence capabilities and to space-based system s. This reachback to space assets provides reliable, robust long -range communications, environmental monitoring, and warning of enem y missile launch. Joint special operations capabilities can assist the tactical m ission with special operations aviation, special reconnaissance, and direct acti on against high-payoff targets. Joint resources also provide the Army force s augm entation by Marine ground forces. In coastal areas, Naval forces and Coast Guard elements assist Army forces with security, sealift, and fire support. Com manders of a m ajor opera- tion coordinate with the JFC regardin g available joint resources and their allocation. They then ensure that thei r efforts coordinate with and comple- ment those of tactical Arm y forces in the urban area. Appendix D discusses the potential contribution of joint capabilities to Arm y UO. 4-12"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":" Conte mpla ting Urba n Ope rations URBAN ISR 4-37. Com manders at all levels require accurate and tim ely inform ation to conduct assessments for successful urban operations. This is critical to planning and execution. Senior commander s have a large role in coordinating the urban ISR effort. National strategi c sources (as well as open sources) provide m ost of the inform ation that com manders and staffs require on the characteristics of the human dimensio n, the physical properties of the terrain, and the infrastructure. The genera l characteristics of these aspects of the urban environm ent do not change drastically over tim e, with one excep- tion. Military operations or natural disasters can change physical charac- teristics drastically. Analysts can obtain crucial inform ation through diligent research of intelligence databases and op en sources. However, the disposition and composition of the urban threat is tim e sensitive and not likely to be discovered through this type of investig ation. Due to the effects of the urban environm ent, deceptive efforts may influence the threat m ore easily. T he urban population is dynamic and updated or confirmed as a prelude to urban operations. Surveillance and reconnaissance provide accurate and tim ely inform ation regarding threat dispositions, com position and the state of the population, and the specifics of the urban terrain. Successful urban opera- tions depend on the successful conduct of urban reconnaissance (see also the discussion of effects on the intelligence and com mand and control BOS in Chapter 5). Challenges 4-38. The most significant challenge to urban ISR is physical. The physical organization and com plexity of th e urban terrain, both man-made and natural, challenges national strategic, operational, and tactical ISR capabili- ties. Commanders understand the challenges when planning and allocating time and resources to their ISR effort s. They acknowledge that subordinate com manders will face sim ilar challenges. Therefore, com manders consider subordinate capabilities, lim itations, and needs when planning, requesting, allocating, and prioritizing ISR assets and capabilities. 4-39. Imagery Capabilities. A significant national and strategic ISR capa- bility is im agery. However, the struct ures of the urban area significantly degrade the information that imagery ac quires and may make it susceptible to physical deception m easures. Curre nt im agery capabilities cannot pene- trate intrasurface or subsurface areas. Yet, im agery is an excellent source regarding the arrangement and nature of many other physical aspects. It can provide significant detail of m ajor portio ns of the infrastructure. Imagery can also reveal what may be happening in structures through detailed study of patterns and other exterior indicators. Yet, the bulk of a skillful threat’s forces, well positioned and concealed in side or underneath structures in the urban area, are largely im mune from rapid detection by overhead imaging system s. The volum e of m ovem ent in an urban area will itself provide a degree of cam ouflage and increase the difficulty of em ploying pattern analysis. The success in 1999 of the Yugoslavian army concealing heavy forces when confronting NATO indica tes the limits of these assets to penetrate an urban area. 4-13"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ 4-40. Electronic Capabilities. T he physical attributes of the urban area also dim inish the effectiveness of elec tronic ISR capabilities. Buildings and other structures significantly disrupt radio communications in an urban area. Buildings not only m ake tactical radio com munications difficult for the user, they also m ake them difficult to locate, intercept, and jam. The range and clarity of frequency m odulation (F M) signals significantly diminish when antennas are located inside buildings or when buildings block line of sight between the source and receiving station. To mitigate this effect, detection capabilities often move closer to the tr ansm ission source. Without losing tac- tical surprise and increasing risk, units cannot effectively use m any electronic detection and surveillance capabilities until urban com bat is im minent or perhaps already begun. Thus, the thre at’s vulnerability to com prom ise by means of his FM and other wireless communications in an urban environ- ment is much less than in many other environments. 4-41. Human Capabilities. The lim its on im agery and electronic ISR capa- bilities place a prem ium on hum an-based visual reconnaissance. Com - manders have three types of hum an reconnaissance assets to augm ent elec- tronic reconnaissance resources: specia l reconnaissance, conventional combat reconnaissance, and hum an intelligence (HUMINT) gathered by m ilitary intelligence from individuals. The ur ban environm ent poses several chal- lenges to these capabilities. 4-42. The urban area challenges special reconnaissance in several ways. First is the access the urban area. Although avenues of approach may be num erous, concealed avenues of approach into a defended urban area may be lim ited and thoroughly covered. Air a ccess is also more difficult because aircraft are detected more easily, airspa ce is smaller, drop and landing zones are limited or not secure, and more ai r defense systems probably exist. Still, special reconnaissance efforts to penetr ate the urban area can be successful using unconventional techniques including high-altitude low-opening parachutes or underwater penetration. 4-43. Special reconnaissance then faces a second challenge: moving in and identifying targets in the urban area. Stealth m ovem ent in an occupied urban area is exceptionally difficult. Re positioning to new or alternate posi- tions is also dangerous. The soldiers’ ability to conceal them selves am ong the civil population can mitigate some of these challenges but includes inherent risks of a different nature. Also difficult is establishing observation positions that provide a field of view of several targets. 4-44. Finally, special reconnaissance may face navigational and reporting challenges. Special reconnaissance’s ab ility to locate them selves and com mu- nicate critical locations and routes are challenged by— • Differences in language and numbering systems. • Irregular street patterns. • Outdated maps. • Intervening structures that impede communications and global posi- tioning systems. • Changes to the landscape due to the effects of UO or natural disasters. • Featureless shantytowns. 4-14"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":" Conte mpla ting Urba n Ope rations 4-45. Conventional reconnaissance face s m any of the sam e challenges as special reconnaissance. Conventional reconnaissance also may lack the advantage of surprise and the special equipm ent and training that provides special reconnaissance stealth capability. Conventional reconnaissance is not likely to operate undetected by the civilian population. Given the constraints discussed above on other sources, co nventional reconnaissance units will likely begin their m ission with m uch le ss information than they would have on threat dispositions in a less com plex environm ent. Com manders may choose to have their reconnaissance elem ents fight for inform ation in the urban area. While this high-risk opti on is m ore favorable under fluid conditions, it can be used at any time. It requires careful planning, rehearsal, and formulation of information requirements. 4-46. Hum an intelligence m ay be one of the m ost valuable sources for infor- mation regarding the situation inside an urban area. HUMINT may take ad- vantage of the proxim ity and large num bers of potential informants to gather inform ation about threat activities and capabilities. It is especially valuable because it can address all elem ents of the environm ent. HUMINT sources can describe political and religious nua nces significant to com manders. Such inform ation is useful for insights regarding the human dimension but extrem ely difficult to obtain from other m eans. This intelligence also can describe the infrastructure relating e ssential details of how the infrastruc- ture functions. Obtaining good HUMI NT requires skilled interrogators and linguists. Com manders know and account for som e of the possible short- comings of HUMINT: • It is susceptible to the influence of the threat; the threat can threaten and influence the source. • It is limited by the accuracy of the source’s perceptions. • It m ay not be tim ely. The process of identifying and cultivating a source (particularly in an environm ent where most civilians support threat forces), gathering informatio n, analyzing the information, and providing the intelligence to com manders can be extrem ely tim e consuming. • Som e inform ants may com e from unscrupulous or sordid elem ents of the urban society and may have their own agenda. They m ay attem pt to use protection afforded them by their relationship with Arm y forces to conduct activities (even atrocities ) that will com prom ise political and military objectives. Conducting Urban ISR 4-47. To be successful, ISR efforts (nationa l to tactical level) are exceptionally comprehensive and synchronized. Su ccess requires integrating all ISR sources into operational and tactical pla nning. This requires that ISR assets be deployed and execute early, diversify, properly focus, and integrate into a com prehensive ISR plan. It also requires flexibility to adapt to the opera- tional and tactical needs of the com mander (see F igure 4-3 on page 4-16). 4-48. Early Deployment. One of the first requirem ents for effective urban ISR is the early deploym ent and em ploym ent of assets. The com plex urban terrain presents a significant challenge. It will norm ally take longer for ISR assets to gather data amid the complexity. 4-15"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ 4-49. Limited national, strategic, and opera- tional im agery intelligence (IMINT) and sig- nals intelligence (SIGINT) capabilities are requested. If they are approved, they are tasked and deployed or repositioned to begin urban ISR operations. This takes tim e. Spacing the ISR effort over tim e perm its the analysis of the inform ation or data as it is received. Such time also permits subsequently refining the ISR effort before all assets are commi tte d. 4-50. SOF or conventional units will require significantly more time to execute reconnais- sance missions and maintain an acceptable survivability rate. Urban reconnaissance operations require additional tim e for stealthy insertion into the urban area. IMINT and SIGINT capabilities are used to identify possible locations of high-value targets and corresponding observation positions; thi s he lps mi nimi ze ti me -consumi ng and high-risk repositioning in the ur ban area. Again, reconnaissance units may require extensive tim e to observe from observation positions for indicators of threat activity and disposition and identify patterns. Early Depl oymen t Ear ly Deployment Divers ity Diver sity Focus Fo cus Integration Integration Flexibility Flexibi lity Figure 4-3. Urban ISR Conside r ations 4-51. As conventional combat forces prepare to commit to the urban area, conventional reconnaissance precedes their actions. Conventional reconnais- sance will often be a slow and m ethodic al effort. Such forces need tim e to reconnoiter the interior of structures for snipers and other small threat team s. They also need tim e to deploy and destroy snipers and small delaying elem ents and to breach harassing obstac les. If necessary, they need time to mass the combat power necessary to fight through security forces and continue reconnaissance. 4-52. Diversity. No single ISR capability can solve the riddle of the urban defense. The only way to successfully gain a thorough com mon operational picture of the complex urban terrain—so commanders can focus combat power on decisive points—is to em ploy diverse ISR capabilities. These capa- bilities will each contribute pieces of relevant inform ation to perm it iden- tifying operational objectives and leveraging tactical com bat power to achieve those obj ectives quickly. Higher-level commanders know that tactical recon- naissance capabilities alone often cannot provide all the tactical inform ation required for success at lower echelons. 4-53. Using diverse capabilities challeng es the threat’s ability to defeat the friendly ISR effort. A threat who focuses on m inim izing his vulnerability to satellite im agery m ay increase his reliance on com munications and thus his vulnerability to SIGINT. At the sam e tim e, he may decrease his ability to detect the actions of ground reconnai ssance units. A threat that actively campaigns to detect ground reconna issance may make hi mse lf mo re vul - nerable to SIGINT and IMINT. 4-16"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":" Conte mpla ting Urba n Ope rations 4-54. Diverse capabilities also facilitate the tactical ISR effort. Tactical recon- naissance units often consist of small dismounted teams and small combined arm s team s with a dism ounted elem ent and an arm or-protected mounted elem ent. Engineers and breaching cap ability are essential to the com bined arms reconnaissance effort. The team s’ movements are synchronized and coordinated with other assets, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and air cavalry reconnaissance. These team s use several movement techniques including infiltration, with the prim ary objective of conducting zone recon- naissance along key axes that support brigade and battalion actions against decisive points. To accom plish this mission, reconnaissance reconnoiters the proposed routes and alternate approaches. This supports deception and contingency planning. Infiltration of dismounted reconnaissance is made easier when a threat focuses on com bined arms reconnaissance teams. Aerial reconnaissance, such as air cavalry and UAVs, provides early warning of threat elem ents to ground reconnaissance, identifies obstacles and am bush sites, and helps select the routes for ground reconnaissance. Air elem ents may also reduce the m obility of counterreconnaissance forces. 4-55. Focus. Another key to successful ISR is the ability to focus the assets on commander’s critical information requ irem ents (CCIR). This focus begins with the mission and the com mander’s initial planning guidance. It is incre- mentally refined throughout planning and execution as each ISR effort provides inform ation and perm its m ore sp ecific focus in subsequent efforts. The size and com plexity of the urban environm ent require that the ISR effort center strictly on decisive points or centers of gravity (COGs). Therefore, the overall ISR effort will have two m ajor focuses. The first is to confirm and develop inform ation on the decisive points and COG. The second is the approaches to the decisive points an d COG. The first focus will likely drive ISR in support of m ajor operations. The second focus will likely provide the impetus for tactical ISR efforts. For exam ple, special operations reconnais- sance might focus on a major command ce nter that controls the entire urban area and that is one of a corps CCIR. Tactical reconnaissance might focus on the nature of the defense along a particular avenue of approach to the obj ective. 4-56. Integration. Another im portant aspect of urban ISR is integration. All reconnaissance capabilities provide both distinctive inform ation as well as information that confirms and adds to that com ing from ot her sources. Essen- tial to urban ISR is the link between all of these sources, either directly or through an integrating headquarters. 4-57. ISR operations are vertically an d horizontally linked. Vertical links ensure that ISR operations am ong the various levels of com mand are com ple- mentary and that the information flow between these levels is rapid. Hori- zontal links ensure that forces operat ing in close proxim ity (particularly adj acent units), where areas of interest overlap, can rapidly share results of their individual ISR efforts. Together, this helps ensure that all Arm y forces share a com mon operational picture and perm its the greatest flexibility and survivability of ISR resources. 4-58. ISR operations also are integrated into the planning system , especially the targeting process.

Flexibility. The urban ISR effort is m ore flexible than in other opera- tions. This flexibility perm its the ISR e ffort to m eet unforeseen circum stances and to deal with the challenges of the urban environm ent. As indicated previously, the urban environm ent is part icularly difficult to penetrate. The practical effects of this characteristic are that— • The initial ISR effort m ay not be as successful as in other operations. • More intelligence requirem ents m ay be discovered later while exe- cuting ISR operations than otherwise. • The threat may be more successful in active counterreconnaissance because of the concealm ent advantages of the urban environm ent (hiding in structures as well as am ong the urban population). Therefore, tactical and operational co mmanders consider requesting greater than usual ISR support from higher he adquarters. Higher headquarters is proactive in augmenting units conducti ng urban operations with additional ISR assets. Additionally, ISR assets rem aining under the control of the higher headquarters respond more quickly to the CCIR of supported com - manders. Sequencing reconnaissance m issions over tim e provides flexibility by creating uncommitted reconnaissance assets. 4-60. Tim e sequencing of ISR assets is essential to flexibility. It m akes ISR assets m ore survivable and allows the intelligence cycle to m ature the CCIR. It also creates a ready ISR capability to augm ent com mitted forces in critical areas if required or diverts them around centers of threat resistance. If not required, it executes original tasks as envisioned in planning. Cueing allows a high-value ISR asset to be capable to respond to m ultiple targets based on an ongoing assessm ent of the overall reconnaissance effort and the changing CCIR. Redundancy perm its the effort to overcome line of sight restrictions, the destruction of an ISR asset, and the ability to com bine ISR resources to create combat power if required. Maximizi ng the ISR effort requires applying all available ISR assets to support the urban operation. Additionally, assets— such as air defense artillery and field artillery radars and engineer squads— are integrated into the ISR effort. In urban operations, units will also com mit infantry and arm or elem ents (plus their organic reconnaissance elem ents) into the tactical reconnaissance effo rt. These units increase the dism ount capability and the ability of reconnaissance elem ents to fight for inform ation and fight through security zones. INFORMATION OPERATIONS 4-61. Information operations are an inte gral part of all Arm y operations and a critical com ponent in creating and m aintaining inform ation superiority. The inform ation environm ent is the sum of individuals, organizations, or systems that collect, process, and dissemi nate inform ation; it also includes the inform ation itself. In UO, the inform ation environm ent is extrem ely dense due to the proliferation of IN FOSYS and widespread access to those system s. In urban operations, com manders consider how the urban environ- ment, particularly the hum an com ponent, uniquely relates to executing IO. 4-18"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":" Conte mpla ting Urba n Ope rations 4-62. IO are executed using core and supporting elements and related activities (see Fig- ure 4-4 and FM 100-6). The elem ents of IO are em ployed in either an offensive or defensive role. Many elem ents of IO are not affected differently in an urban environm ent from any other environm ent. T he fol- lowing sections outline som e IO considerations unique to urban operations.

In the urban environment, Army forces can leverage existing urban infrastructure, including the com munications and inform ation infrastructure, to enhance Arm y operations. The danger in integrating these system s is vio- lating OPSEC. Com mands ensure that Arm y forces use only approved systems and proper safeguards exist. Commands also supervise subordinate units for inadvertent breaches of OP SEC policies when using existing urban systems. 4-64. The close proxim ity of the Arm y operations to a civil population, parti- cularly in stability operations and support operations, m akes Arm y activities them selves an OP SEC concern. Hostiles or other threats integrated into the urban population may have more chances to observe Arm y activities closely. Such observations can provide insight into tactics, techniques, and proce- dures (TTP) and expose operational vu lnerabilities. However, threats may coerce even friendly civilians to prov ide a threat EEFI, and are supplem ented with m ilitary deception efforts. Com manders in an urban environm ent ensure that civilians cannot observ e critical TTP. Any observable patterns and TTP vary and are supple mented with de ceptio n e ffo rts. Physical security is increasingly im portant in urban area s to control civilians’ access. Although many urban operations require close coordination with NGOs, commanders screen inform ation provided to them to protect EEFI. Release of EEFI to NGOs is controlled and done with full recognition and understanding of potential consequences—the benefits mu st far outweigh the risks involved. Psychological Operations 4-65. PSYOP aim to influence the behavior and attitude of foreign audiences, both m ilitary and noncom batant, in the urban environm ent. PSYOP are a force multiplier and contribute in many ways to mission success (see FM 33-1-1). Their ability to influence the attitudes and disposition of the urban population cannot be overstated. While the com plexity of the societal com ponent of the urban environm ent can m ake P SYOP challenging, it also offers many options and resources. Po tentially, PSYOP (with other political and econom ic actions) m ay help lim it or preclude the use of m ilitary force in urban areas. In som e circum stances, military operations may be relevant only in term s of their psychological effect. 4-19"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ 4-66. The positive influence created by PSYOP is often essential to develo- ping an effective HUMINT capability pa rticularly in an urban area where many civilians actively or passively su pport the threat. Persuading and influ- encing a few to support friendly force s may pay great dividends. These few supporters may allow Army forces to penetrate the urban area and obtain essential inform ation. Such inform atio n can apply to threat capabilities, threat intentions, and even the urban environm ent itself. 4-67. PSYOP , com bined with other elem ents of offensive IO, aid in isolation of a threat—a critical shaping action for any urban operation. For example, com manders m ay use PSYOP to inform civilians about new food distribution points located away from urban combat operations. This action supports the UO fundamental of separating combatan ts from noncombatants and helps to further isolate the threat (both phys ically and psychologically) from the civilian populace. Aside from projecting a positive im age of friendly forces over threat forces, PSYOP also isolates the threat. These operations identify and exploit ethnic, cultural, religious, and econom ic differences between the elem ents of the civilian populace and th reat forces as well as the differences am ong supportive and unsupportive civilian factions. The com plexity of the urban environm ent enables quick changes in opinion or attitude. Com - manders continually evaluate the results of P SYOP for m ission relevance. Counterpropaganda 4-68. Because propaganda is aimed at both combatants and noncombatants, UO are especially concerned with its use. Propaganda can rapidly and dra- matically affect the attitudes of the urban population and will probably occur after urban operations have begun. T hus, it can create situations in the human dimension of the environment quit e different from those discovered in the pre-operations assessm ent. Counterpr opaganda is, therefore, essential to urban operations. To negate, deflect, or destroy the threat’s propaganda capability, counterpropaganda requires— • Monitoring the threat’s propaganda efforts. • Evaluating the effectiveness of those efforts. • Determ ining m ethods using all Arm y force capabilities, especially PSYOP and PA units. Military Deception 4-69. Urban operations present num erous challenges to tactical com manders; however, higher-level com manders m ay help to mitigate some challenges. Com manders can use m ilitary deception efforts designed to m islead threat decisionm akers as to friendly force di sposition, capabilities, vulnerabilities, and intentions. Military deception acti ons m ay allow com manders to achieve tactical surprise or improve relative co mbat power at a selected location. For exam ple, allowing the threat to obse rve certain activities on a selected avenue of approach m ay cause the threat to shift his forces (and effort) to the area perceived to be threatened. (This mo veme nt may al so ai d i n de termi ning the overall disposition of threat forces and intentions.) Repositioned forces or effort to activities or locations that are not decisive to the achievem ent of friendly obj ectives, com bined with other IO designed to overwhelm his inform ation and intelligence system s, m ay create the force and tem po 4-20"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":" Conte mpla ting Urba n Ope rations differential necessary to achieve succe ss. Com manders tailor urban deception plans to the specific urban area, paying close attention to the societal charac- teristics of the target population. Electronic Warfare 4-70. Electronic warfare (EW) includes all actions that use electrom agnetic or directed energy weapons to control the electrom agnetic spectrum or to attack a threat. Conducting EW in urban areas seeks to achieve m uch the sam e results as in other environm ents. A m ajor consideration in urban areas is collateral effects on portions of the ur ban infrastructure that rely on the electrom agnetic spectrum for service. Thus, precision is a m ajor factor in planning for EW operations. For exam ple, EW attacking a threat’s television broadcasts avoids affecting the televisi on broadcasts of neutral or friendly television. Likewise, EW attacking m ilitary com munications in a large urban area avoids adversely affecting the ar ea’s police and other em ergency service com munications. Urban offensive and defe nsive operations will have the least restrictions on EW operations while urban stability operations and support operations m ay have significant constraints on using EW capabilities. Computer Network Operations 4-71. Com puter network operations (CNO) include com puter network attack (CNA), com puter network defense (CND), and com puter network exploitation (CNE). CNO are not applicable to units at corps and below. Echelons above corps (EAC) units will conduct CNA and CN E. If tactical units require either of these network support, they will request it of EAC units. 4-72. Computer Network Defense. In urban operations, CND will require extrem e m easures to protect and defe nd the com puters and networks from disruption, denial, degradation, or de struction. The nature of the urban environm ent and configuration of com puter networks provides the threat with many opportunities to interdic t local area networks (LANs) unless monitored by m ilitary forces. LANs cont rolled by m ilitary forces are norm ally more secure than the civilian infras tructure. Com manders prepare for oppor- tunities by the threat to insert misinformation. 4-73. Computer Network Attack. Considerations regarding the execution of CNA in urban operations are sim ilar to those of EW: CNAs that do not dis- crim inate can disrupt vital civilian system s. However, possible adverse effects on the civilian infrastructure can be m uch larger—potentially on a global scale. In the short term , CNAs m ay serve to enhance im mediate com bat operations but have a debilitating effect on the efficiency of follow-on urban stability operations. Because of th ese far-reaching effects, tactical units do not execute CNA. CNA is requested of EAC units. EAC units will receive all requests from lower echelons , carefully consider second- and third- order effects of CNA, and work to ensure its precise application. 4-74. Computer Network Exploitation. CNE is an enabling operation and intelligence collection to gather data from target or adversary autom ated INFOSYS or networks. Tactical units do not have the capability for CNE. CNE contributes to intelligence collection at EAC. In UO, CNE will be centrally controlled. 4-21"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ Information Assurance 4-75. Information assurance in UO take s on an added dimension. As with other operations, availability of inform ation m eans tim ely, reliable access to data and services by authorized users. In UO, the tim eliness of inform ation may be restricted because structures block the transm ission waves. The need for retransm ission facilities will overwhelm the signal com munity. The reliability can be questioned because of the blockage between units and com - munications nodes. Unauthorized us ers may intercept the communications and input m isinform ation or disinform ation. Com manders protect the integrity of all inform ation from unautho rized changes, including destruction. INFOSYS with integrity operate correct ly, consistently, and accurately. The authentication of information may be accomplished by sophisticated elec- tronic m eans. However, it is m ore likely that com munications-electronics operating instructions authentication tables will authenticate the inform a- tion. Com manders consider the confidential nature of all inform ation in UO. The G6 protects the inform ation from unauthorized disclosure. Information being passed cannot be repudiated. The density of the infrastructure in urban areas m ay inhibit receipt by the intended individual or unit. The sender may have no means to determine if the message was received. Counterdeception 4-76. In UO, threat forces can easily accom plish deception operations. The force that controls the area above and below ground will have freedom of movem ent. Deception aim ed at friendly com manders will cause them to deploy combat power at the wrong place and the wrong time. Counter- deception by friendly com manders will iden tify and exploit threat attem pts to mislead friendly forces. Counterdeceptio n is difficult. Cultures of certain rhetoric and actions are m ore predispo sed to deception than others. Knowing a threat’s previous deception methods is im portant. Dism issing tactical indi- cators because they conflict with preconceptions m ay allow a hostile deception operation that plays on the preconception to succeed. Physical Destruction 4-77. Physical destruction includes those actions—including direct and indirect fires from air, land, sea, sp ace, and Special Forces—taken with, to augm ent, or supplem ent IO actions. L ike many other IO elem ents, major concerns with employing physical dest ruction in UO are precision and follow- on effects. Thus, commanders using ph ysical destruction to support IO adhere to the same constr aints as all other fires. Counterintelligence 4-78. Counterintelligence (CI) in the context of IO focuses on detecting threats against INFOSYS. The urban environm ent, particularly in stability operations and support operations, is ideal for espionage, other intelligence activities, sabotage, or assassination . Threats can approach, conduct recon- naissance, and escape under the concealm ent of the urban terrain and population. 4-22"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":" Conte mpla ting Urba n Ope rations 4-23 Civil-Military Operations 4-79. Civil-m ilitary operations (CMO) are a critical aspect of virtually every urban operation and are included here as a closely related activity of IO. CMO activities enhance the relationship between m ilitary forces, civilian authorities, and the urban population. They prom ote the developm ent of fav- orable em otions, attitudes, or behavior. CMO range from support to com bat operations to assisting in establishing political, econom ic, and social stability. Chapter 9 has a more detailed discu ssion of CMO and CA units. However, because of its criticality to UO, CMO and its effects are thoroughly integrated throughout this manual. Public Affairs Four hostile newspapers are more to be feared than a thousand bayonets. Napoleon Bonaparte 4-80. Another related activity to IO is public affairs (PA). PA influences urban operations by transmitting information through the media to internal (in urban Arm y forces as well as in the urban civilian populace) and external audiences. At higher levels of command, PA can he lp m aintain popular national support for the urban operation by clarifying the links between strategic goals and operational obj ectives. At both the oper ational and tactical levels, it links Army units, the urban inhabitants, the US and international public, and the media. PA can help determ ine potential m edia issues that m ay influence planned UO. It can also aid commanders in assessing the im pact of UO on the environment (particularly its citizens) and other agencies and organizations operating in the urban area. PA also helps to counter rum ors, uncertainty, fear, loneliness, confusion, and othe r factors that cause stress (to both soldiers and civilians) and underm ine effective UO. If the populace does not understand the m ission, false expectations m ay be created that Arm y forces may not be able to m eet. PA can help prepare the Am erican public for the possibility of high casualty rates. Ov erall, PA supports urban com manders in their goals to achieve inform ation supe riority and preserve public support. 4-81. PA does not distort, direct, or m anipulate inform ation. Its effectiveness stem s directly from establishing and maintaining credibility with the urban population and media. Com manders synchronize P A with the integral ele- ments of IO (particularly PSYOP and counterpropaganda) to ensure that all Army sources send only one message. Urban commanders plan for the media and integrate P A into their decisionm aking and (through IO) targeting processes. 4-82. The density of information sources and reporters in UO ensures that all Arm y activities will be subject to m edia and public scrutiny. Many reporters will congregate in cities for their own com fort and take advantage of estab- lished communications networks. Urban areas are densely populated and, together with Arm y forces and NGOs operating there, will present the greatest num ber of hum an-interest stories. T he local urban or host-nation media, however, will often have their own agendas developed over a longer period of tim e. This local m edia will also have a greater influence over the urban population than the internatio nal media. The indigenous media may not follow international norm s. Com manders are responsible to understand"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ 4-24 the media (particularly the local media), its role, and its potential influence. They cannot allow them selves to be intimidated by it. Commanders support open and independent reporting and grant access to their units as early and as far forward as the situation permits. • Truth is Paramount • If News is Out, It is Out • Public Affairs Must be Deployed Early • Not All News is Good News • Practice Security at the Source • Media are Not the Enemy • Telling Our Story is Good for the Army • Soldiers and Families Come First Figure 4-5. Public Affairs Principles 4-83. The PA principles listed in Figure 4-5 and addressed in FM 46-1 summarize PA. The y serve as useful guides toward planning and executing PA operations regardless of the en- vironment. However, the princi- ples of “practice security at the source,” and “truth is para- mount” particularly apply to the urban environm ent. T he com - partmented nature of most UO impede commanders’ and their PA officers’ ability to be at all places where th e m edia will likely be. Therefore, all soldiers are trained, provided with clear and understandable PA guidance, and prepared to com municate to the civ ilian m edia. The keys at all levels are understanding, prepared acceptance, and truthfulness tempered with an essential concern for OPSEC. INTEGRATION OF CONVENTIONAL AND SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES 4-84. One important Army and joint re source that commanders of a major operation can use to influence urban oper ations is SOF. Several types of these forces exist, each with unique and com plem entary capabilities. They can be extrem ely valuable in UO for their ability to execute discrete m issions with a higher degree of precision than conventi onal forces, to provide inform ation, and to enhance cultural understanding . However, the challenges of using SOF include command and control, inte gration, and coordination with con- ventional forces that will norm ally com mand, control, and conduct the bulk of UO tasks. The density and com plexity of UO m ake close coordination and synchronization of conventional forces and SOF essential to mission success. The nature of the environm ent dictates that both forces will work in close proxim ity to each other; the separation in space and tim e between SOF and conventional forces will often be much less in urban areas than in other envi- ronm ents. Overall, the nature of the environm ent dem ands a synergistic com - bination of capabilities to achieve effe cts on the threat and m ission success. 4-85. Successfully integrating SOF occurs with proper integration into, or coordination with, the com mand structure of the force conducting the UO. SOF within a theater (less PSYOP and CA) ordinarily fall under joint com - mand and control. Therefore, the com mander of the m ajor operation respon- sible for an urban area, if he is not a JFC, will have to coordinate through the JFC to integrate SOF capabilities into the UO. Exam ples of critical coordina- tion elem ents include boundaries, no-fire areas, coordination points, and re- quirements to support search and rescue contingencies. 4-86. A special operations com mand an d control elem ent (SOCCE) is usually form ed at Arm y corps level, specifically to coordinate integrating the SOF with conventional forces. The SOCCE links conventional force com manders"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":" Conte mpla ting Urba n Ope rations with the SOF units operating in their AOs. It prim arily deconflicts conven- tional and SOF targets, positions, and missions. The synchronization and unity of action necessary between conventional and SOF in an urban AO may still require the Arm y force headquarters to further coordinate SOF integra- tion through the JT F com mander. T he special operations coordination elem ent (SOCOORD) is the ARSOF elem ent within the Arm y corps or Marine expeditionary force (MEF) G3 section responsible for coordinating special operations requirem ents. As an integral part of the corps or MEF staff, the SOCOORD provides a focal point for SOF command, control, com munications, com puters, and intelligen ce structure to synchronize special operations activities in support of corps m issions. COORDINATION WITH OTHER AGENCIES 4-87. The population density of the urban environm ent, its econom ic and political im portance, and its life-supporting infrastructure attracts m any types of organizations. These organizations include— • Other US governmental agencies. • International governmental organizations. • Allied and neutral national governm ents. • Allied and coalition forces. • Local governm ental agencies and politicians. • NGOs. Even in a MT W, m any organizations operate in the area as long as possible before combat or as soon as possible after com bat. T herefore, coordination with these organizations sharing the ur ban AO will be essential; however, effective coordination is challenging, time consuming, and manpower inten- sive. The staffs of larger headquarters (divisions or higher) norm ally have the breadth of resources and experience to best conduct the coordination. They can effectively use or m anage the organizations interested in the urban area and mitigate their potential adverse effects on UO. By taking on as m uch of the coordination requirem ents as po ssible, the operational headquarters perm its its tactical subordinates to remain focused on accomplishing their tactical missions. The higher headquarters should assum e as m uch of the burden of coordination as possible. However, the density of the urban environm ent will often require that sm aller tactical units coordinate with other agencies sim ply because of their ph ysical presence in the units’ AOs. In urban stability operations and support operations, m ission accom plishm ent will require effective civil-m ilitary coordi nation activities and m easures at all levels as either a specified or im plied task. Civil-Military Operations Centers 4-88. To coordinate activities am ong the varied agencies and organizations operating in an urban area and the local population, urban commanders can establish a civil-m ilitary operations ce nter (CMOC). The CMOC synchronizes Army activities and resources with th e efforts and resources of all others involved (see FM 41-10). This can be particularly im portant in stability opera- tions and support operations where com bat operations are not the dom inant characteristic of the operation. CMOCs ca n be established at all levels of com - mand. Hence, more than one CMOC m ay exist in an AO, particularly large 4-25"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ urban areas. CMOCs may be organized in various ways and include representatives from as many agencies as required to facilitate the flow of inform ation am ong all concerned parties. Com manders still ensure that force protection and OP SEC requirem ents are not com prom ised. Effective CMOCs can serve as clearinghouses for the receipt and validation of all civilian requests for support, can aid in priori tizing efforts and elim inating redun- dancy, and, most importantly, can reduce wasting the urban commander’s scarce resources. Liaison Officers 4-89. Liaison officers (LNOs)—suffi ciently experienced and adequately trained in liaison duties and functions— are necessary to deal with the other agencies that have interests in the urban area. Army LNOs work with the lead agency or other organizations that the com mander has identified as criti- cal to mission success. Together they work to rapidly establish unity of effort and m aintain coordination, often before a CMOC is established. The addi- tional coordination afforded by the ph ysical presence of L NOs within these organizations m ay be required even after the CMOC is fully functional. When com manders lack enough L NOs to meet requirem ents, they prioritize and often assign a single LNO to seve ral organizations. That LNO will then share his tim e and presence to those organizations based on the situation and his commander’s guidance. Commander’s Personal Involvement 4-90. Overall, establishing a close rela tionship with other agencies will often be a major, positive factor in successf ul m ission accom plishm ent, particularly in urban stability operations. Com manders that develop a direct and personal relationship with the leaders and staff of other agencies can often avoid conflict, win support, and help elim inate the “us versus them ” m entality that frequently frustrates cooperation am ong Arm y forces and civilian organiza- tions. 4-26"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Chapter 5 Foundations for Urban Operations Utilities suc h as electr icity an d water are as much weapons of war as rifles, artille ry pieces or fighter aircr aft. . . .

Ultimately they reached a comp romi se. General Middleton’ s VIII Corp s was tasked to secure the peni nsula, a nd the bul k of Patton’s Army, three Army corp s, wa s turn ed northe ast to exploit the o peratio nal collapse of the main Ge rm an defen ses.

Black Haw k Dow n The fundamental shared aims between stability operations and support operations and any operation condu cted in an urban environment are the increased significance and influence of the civil population and nonmili- tary organizations. Often, no military victory is to be achieved. The center of gravity for these operations no rmally cannot be attacked through military means alone; the Army (and the military in general) is often but one tool supporting a larger, civil-focu sed effort. Without a tightly coordi- nated civil-military effort, success will be difficult or impossible to achieve. Commanders who can understand and cope with the complexities of stability operations and support operations gain insights that directly apply to executing any urban operat ion. Urban stability operations and support operations may complement urban offensive and defensive operations, or may dominate the overa ll operation. Army forces may need to conduct offensive and defensive operations to defend themselves or destroy urban threats seeking to preven t the decisive stability or support mission. During hostilities, urban st ability operations may keep armed conflict from spreading, encourage coalition and alliance partners, and secure the civilian population’s support in unstable urban areas (and the surrounding rural areas under their influence).

Urban support operations can range from trans- porting, feeding, and sheltering the population made homeless as a result of combat operations or natural disast ers to providing medical care during urban counterinsurgency operations. PURPOSE OF URBAN STABILITY OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT OPERATIONS 8-1. Arm y forces conduct stability operat ions and support operations to deter war, resolve conflict, prom ote peace, st rengthen democratic processes, retain United States (US) influence or access abroad, assist US civil authorities, and support m oral and legal im perative s. Stability operations prom ote and sustain regional and global stability. In contrast, support operations meet the urgent needs of designated groups, for a lim ited tim e, until civil authorities can accom plish these tasks without m ilitary assistance. Nearly every urban operation will involve som e type or form of stability operation or support operation com bined and sequenced with offensive and defensive operations. CHARACTERISTICS OF URBAN STABILITY OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT OPERATIONS 8-2. Worldwide urbanization, mi- gration trends from rural to urban areas, and more centralized popu- lations in urban areas increase the chance that Arm y forces will conduct stability operations and support operations in or near urban areas. Simply put, many people live in urban areas, and their welfare will be the prim ary reason for conducting these opera- tions. Urban areas that serve as econom ic and governm ent centers (the ideal location for US and allied em bassies) are often the focal point for many threat activities. T herefore, Arm y forces m ay need to conduct stability operations in these ci ties to counter those threats. Addi- tionally, urban areas may contain the re sources and infrastructure to support both types of operations, regardless of whether the overall focus is in urban or rural areas. Repairing or restorin g the infrastructure may be a critical task in accom plishing a support mission. Supported governmental and nongovernm ental agencies are not as logi stically self-sufficient as the Arm y. As such, these agencies m ay need to ce nter their operations in and around urban areas to use the area’s infrastruc ture to support themselves and their objectives. These agencies may requir e m ilitary protection to accom plish their missions. Figure 8-1 lists some de fining characteristics of these wide- ranging operations. Figure 8-1. Characteristics of Stability Operations and Support Operations • Long or Short Duration • Unilateral or Multinational • Domestic or Foreign • Joint and Interagency • Increased Civil-Military and Legal Considerations • Greater Potential for Ambiguity • Increased Constraints Necessitating More Restrictiv e ROE • Amplified Need for Cultural and Political Sensitivity 8-2 "},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":" Urba n Sta bility Ope rations and Support Ope rations 8-3. Stability operations and support oper ations are diverse, varied in dura- tion, unilateral or m ultinational, and dom estic or foreign. Like all urban operations (UO), they are usually j oint. Unlike urban offensive and defensive operations, they are m ore often inte ragency operations and require more restrictive rules of engagement (ROE). The multiplicity of actors involved usually increases the scope and scale of required coordination and com muni- cation. In urban stability operations or support operations, adverse con- ditions arising from natural or m an-m ade disasters or other endem ic conditions—such as human suffering, dise ase, violations of hum an rights, or privation—will significantly m odify th e urban environm ent. Unresolved poli- tical issues and tenuous agreem ents, di fficulties discriminating combatants from noncom batants or between parties of a dispute, and the absence of basic law and order all serve to complicate an already complex and uncertain envi- ronm ent. Civil-m ilitary and legal consider ations take on added significance in all urban operations (see Civil-Milit ary Operations and Legal Support in Chapter 9), but even m ore so in urban stability operations and support opera- tions. Finally, recognizing and achieving the desired end state is often m ore difficult than in offensive and defensive operations. 8-4. Overall, com manders of m ajor oper ations involving urban stability opera- tions and support operations do not expe ct clear guidance. They learn, adapt, and live with am biguity. They cannot expect to operate in a political vacuum (even com manders at the tactical level) and do not expect an easily identifiable enemy located across a clearly demarcated line. In fact in many peace operations, com manders and their soldiers resist the need to have an enem y—difficult at best when one side or another (or both) m ay be sniping at them . They also expect changing and additional m issions and tasks, without being allowed to use every m eans at their disposal to carry out those mis- sions. Many tasks required may be ones for which their units have never, or rarely, trained. Finally, commanders expe ct to show restraint with a keen sensitivity to political considerations an d to alien cultures, either or both of which they might find confusing or even repugnant. URBAN STABILITY OPERATIONS , SUPPORT OPERATIONS, AND BATTLEFIELD ORGANIZATION 8-5. Each type of urban stability operation or support operation is distinct. These operations differ even m ore when applied to a specific urban area. Due to the com plexity of the environm ent, com manders carefully arrange their forces and operations according to purp ose, tim e, and space to accom plish the mission. In m ost UO the terrain, the dense population (m ilitary and civilian), and the participating organizations will further com plicate this arrangem ent. DECISIVE OPERATIONS 8-6. In urban stability operations, decisive operations m ay take m any years and include m ultiple actions before achieving the desired end state. This par- ticularly applies to the strategic and operational levels. Oppositely, decisive operations involved in an urban support operation for m itigating or reducing disease, hunger, privation, and the effect s of disasters normally achieve faster results. However, an operation that attacks the underlying cause and seeks to prevent or relieve such conditions is m ore a stability operation than a 8-3"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ support operation and will usually take longer. In urban areas, establishing law and order to protect critical infr astructure and the inhabitants from lawlessness and violence is often criti cal and often the decisive operation. SHAPING OPERATIONS 8-7. Shaping operations establish and maintain the conditions for executing decisive operations. In urban stabilit y operations and support operations, shaping operations always include inform ation operations (IO) that influence perceptions and m aintain legitim acy. Of ten, various participants, and their potentially divergent m issions and m ethods, are involved. Arm y com manders coordinate their planning and efforts (early and continuously) to ensure that their decisive, shaping, or sustaining operations are not working against other agencies’ efforts and operations—a gencies that may have the lead role in the operation. Thus, a critical shapin g operation may be to establish the co- ordination to help develop a com mon purpose and direction am ong agencies. In some instances and with some organi zations and agencies, particularly nongovernm ental organizations (NGOs), genuine unity of effort may not be achievable; however, recognizing the di fferences in aim s and goals will allow Arm y com manders to conduct operations with less friction. Com manders include NGOs and appropriate governm ental agencies in mission readiness exercises or any other training for stab ility operations or support operations. SUSTAINING OPERATIONS 8-8. Sustaining operations enable decisive and shaping operations and include combat service support, rear area and base security, movement control, terrain management, and infr astructure development. Sustainment bases, especially those located in urban ar eas, become an attractive target for hostile civilians; therefore, com mander s actively and aggressively protect these bases as well as lines of communications (see Chapter 9). TYPES AND FORMS OF STABILITY OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT OPERATIONS 8-9. Figure 8-2 defines stability operat ions and support operations and lists their subordinate types and forms. If necessary, command ers can refer to FM 3-07 to develop a more detailed under standing of the specifics of these diverse operations. STABILITY OPERATIONS 8-10. Urban areas will be decisive to accom plishing m any types of stability operations because urban areas are the centers of population, culture, econom y, and governm ent. Much of the support provided by Arm y forces will aim to assist local, regional, or nation al governments. Their location (urban areas) will, by necessity, be a dom inati ng factor in accom plishing the m ission. As im portantly, m any stability operat ions—enforcing peace in Bosnia for exam ple—will require interacting, influe ncing, controlling, or protecting all or parts of the civilian population. Assessing, understanding, and gaining the support of civilians in key econom ic, cultural, or political urban areas m ay influence surrounding regions (smaller urban areas and the rural country- side) and m ay be decisive to achiev ing stability objectives. Finally, the 8-4 "},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":" Urba n Sta bility Ope rations and Support Ope rations support and assistance that Arm y forces will provide is only tem porary although often of long duration.

Urban Stability Operations and Support Operations SUPPORT OPERATIONS 8-11. Support operations consist of domestic support and foreign humani- tarian assistance operations. They ca n occur in a foreign urban environment as a result of m ilitary operations a ffecting the infrastructure or from a natural disaster, such as an earthqua ke. Support operations can also occur dom estically when a natural or m an-m ade em ergency overwhelm s local resources. Such a situation could result from a chem ical, biological, radiologi- cal, nuclear, and high-yield explosive (CBRNE) incident, hurricane, flood, or civil disturbance in a domestic urban area. 8-12. CBRNE incidents are disastrous. In urban areas, the potential for cata- strophic loss of life and property is enorm ous. The Arm y categorizes CBRNE incidents separately from other natura l and man-made disasters because it has specific expertise with these we apons. CBRNE incidents usually result from a m ilitary or terrorist threat (adding a law enforcem ent dim ension to the disaster). 8-13. Subways and other subsurface areas offer ideal areas for limited chem ical or biological attacks. Nuclear attack (and high-yield explosives) can produce tragic results due to the effects of collapsing structures, flying debris, 8-5"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ 8-6 and fires. Dispersion patterns are affected by the urban terrain and are more difficult to predict and monitor. Larg e-scale incidents may produce hundreds of thousands of casualties, but even a lim ited attack m ay require evacuating and screening large num bers of civilians. Requirem ents for medical support, basic life support, and, if necessary, decontamination may quickly overwhelm the Arm y force’s capabilities even with augm entation. 8-14. Panic and disorder m ay accom pany the event. Fleeing civilians may clog elem ents of the transportation an d distribution infrastructure. Physical destruction may also affect other compon ents of the infrastructure of critical and immediate concern, such as energy and administration and human ser- vices (water, sanitation, medical, fi re fighting, and law enforcem ent). Because all elem ents of the infrastr ucture m ay be affected, the overall recovery time may be lengthened and the effects broadened to include m uch of the surrounding area. The effects of a single urban CBRNE event potentially could be felt nationally or globally. In wars of intervention the essentials are to secure a general who is both a statesman and a soldier; to have clear with the allies as to the part to be taken by each in the princi- pal operations; finally, to agree upon an objective point which shall be in harmony with the common interests. Lieutenant General Antoine-Henri, Baron de Jomini stipulations 8-15. The urban operational framework (assess, shape, dominate, and transition) provides a structure for developing considerations unique to urban stability operations and support opera- tions. Many considerations presented in urban offensive and defensive operations apply to urban stability opera- tions and support operations, particularly those that address how to assess the urban and overall operational environm ent. Because the situations in which stability opera- tions and support operations norm ally occur share strong similarities with any urban environm ent, m any of these considerations are closely linked to the urban fundamentals presented in Chapter 5. Taken together, com- manders will often find them useful in conducting UO throughout the full range of operations and across the spectrum of conflict. Appendix C has a historical exam ple of how to apply the urban operational fram ework to sup- port operations and stability operations. CONSIDERATIONS OF URBAN STABILITY OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT OPERATIONS ASSESS 8-16. In urban stability operations and support operations, com manders care- fully assess the political dim ension of the operational environm ent, as well as their role and the m edia’s part in managing inform ation. These operations are inherently tied to the exercise of diplom atic power. All operations in urban areas are often the focus of the m edia and thus gain considerable public and political attention. Therefor e, m ilitary objectives in urban stability operations and support operations are more directly linked with political obj ectives. The relationship between the levels of war—strategic, operational,"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":" Urba n Sta bility Ope rations and Support Ope rations 8-7 and tactical—is often closer than in urban offensive and defensive operations. Military objectives are carefully nest ed within political objectives. Com - manders ensure that the ways and m eans to accom plish their obj ectives, to include security and force protection m easures, will hold up to m edia scrutiny and are appropriate for the situation and environm ent. All levels of com mand understand the link between political and m ilitary objectives, to include a basic understanding at the individual level. One uncoordinated, undisci- plined, or inappropriate action, even at the lowest level, could negate months or years of previous, disciplined e ffort. Commanders balance security and force protection m easures with m ission accom plishm ent. Ineffective measures can put soldiers at too great a risk and j eopardize the m ission. Conversely, overly stringent m easures may make it difficult for forces to interact with the population closely—e ssential in m any of these operations. Finally, com manders will need a thorough assessm ent of the governm ental and nongovernm ental organizations and ag encies that will be operating in or near urban areas that fall within their area of operations. Political and Military Objectives Commanders consult the US Agency for International Development’s (USAID) Field Operations Guide for Disaster Assessm ent and Response when conducting their assessments and developing measures of effectiveness for many urban relief operations. 8-17. Commanders translate political objectives into mili- tary obj ectives that are clear and achievable (clear tasks and purposes) and can lead to the desired end state. Political objectives may be vague making it difficult for com- manders to conduct their mission analysis . This applies to tactical- and even operational-level com manders, unskilled at higher level, strategic political- military assessm ents. Each type of stability operation or support operation is distinct, often unfam iliar to the executing unit, and unique to the specific situation. These factors often m ake it difficult to confidently determ ine the specific tasks that will lead to m issi on success. Therefore, com manders also establish m easures of effectiveness th at aid in understanding and measuring progress and help gauge m ission accom plishm ent. 8-18. These criteria should be measur able (in some circumstances, a quali- tative assessm ent m ay be m ost appropriate) and link cause with effect. They help determ ine the changes required and are essential to the assessm ent cycle required for urban stability operations and support operations. In a hum anitarian relief operation to aid the starving, commanders could deter- mine that the decisive effort is deliv ering safe food to the urban area. T o judge success or effectiveness, they could determ ine that the measure is the num ber of food trucks dispatched daily to each distribution site; the more trucks, the m ore effective the efforts. However, this measure must correlate with the overarching m easure of effectiv eness: decline in the m ortality rate. If no significant decrease in deaths du e to starvation occurs, they m ay need to reassess and modify the tasks or measure of effectiveness. A better measure may be to track the amount of food consum ed by those in need instead of sim ply counting the num ber of trucks dispatched."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ 8-19. However, planners also be wary of the unintended consequences of well-intentioned urban support operations . For exam ple, providing free, safe food m ay alleviate starvation, but coul d also undercut the local agricultural system by reducing dem and in the m arket. If the food is distributed through urban centers, urbanization could increas e, further reducing the food supply and adding to the existing strains on the infrastructure. Areas around which measures of effectiveness can be form ed for many stability operations and support operations (including the exam ple above) and which will help return most societies to some degree of normalcy and self-sufficiency include: • Decreasing m orbidity and m ortality rates. • Securing safe food. • Resettling the population. • Reestablishing econom ic activity. • Restoring law and order. Although not m ilitary in nature, com mand ers can often develop m easures of effectiveness to address these areas in te rm s of providing security or logistics. 8-20. Political objectives are fluid and modified in response to new domestic and international events or circumsta nces. Thus, assessment is continuous, and com manders adj ust their own obj ectives and subsequent missions ac- cordingly. In urban stability operations and support operations, com manders often develop m ilitary objectives that su pport or align with the objectives of another agency that has overall responsibility for the urban operation. In this supporting role, commanders may re ceive num erous requests for soldier and m ateriel assistance from the supported agency and other supporting agencies operating in the urban area (to include elem ents of the urban population). With such unclear lines of authority and areas of responsibility, they ensure that the tasks, missions, or requested Army resources fall clearly in the intended scope and purpose of the Arm y’s participation in the operation. They do not develop or execute m issions based on inadequate or false assum ptions, m isinterpreted intent, or well-m eaning but erroneously interpreted laws or regulations by any organization, to include even the lead agency. When m issions appear outside their scope, com manders quickly relay their assessment to their higher head quarters for immediate resolution. Security and Force Protection Measures 8-21. Commanders plan for and continually assess the security of their forces operating in an urban area as well as constantly re- view protection m easures. Establishing a robust intelligence—particularly hum an intelligence (HUMINT)—network that can determine the inten- tions and capabilities of the threat and the urban populace is the basis for 8-8 "},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":" Urba n Sta bility Ope rations and Support Ope rations establishing force protection for Arm y forces operating in the urban environm ent. However, m any such operations, particularly stability operations, require extra tim e to forge a lasting change. Over tim e, and particularly in peacetim e when object ives center on helping others and avoiding violence, even the com plex urban environm ent m ay seem benign. Without continued, aggressive comma nd em phasis, soldiers m ay becom e lulled into com placency. It is usually then that Arm y forces are most vulnerable to terrorist tactics, such as bombings, kidnappings, ambushes, raids, and other form s of urban violence. 8-22. Although force protection will not ensure successful urban stability operations or support operations, im proper assessm ent and inadequate force protection measures can cause the oper ation to fail. In either operation, keeping a neutral attitude toward all el em ents of the urban population, while maintaining the appropriate defensiv e posture, enhances security. One threat principle discussed in Chapter 3 was that threats would seek to cause politically unacceptable casualties. An improper threat assessment and a lapse in security at the tactical level could result in casualties. That result could affect strategy by influencing domestic popular support and subse- quently national leadership decisions and policy. 8-23. Emphasizing security and force protection m easures does not m ean isolating soldiers from contact with the urban population. On the contrary, com manders balance survivability with m obility according to the factors of MET T-TC—m ission, enem y, terrain and weather, troops and support available, tim e available, civil cons iderations. Survivability m easures—such as hardening or fortifying buildings and installations, particularly where large num bers of soldiers are billeted— m ay be required. On the other hand, mobility operations are essential in pres erving freedom of action and denying a threat the opportunity to observe, plan, and attack urban forces. Mission degradation and increased risk to the force can result if force protection measures prevent Arm y forces from conducting prudent m issions and estab- lishing an active and capable presence. Assessment of Security and Force Protection Belfast, Northern Ireland Since 1969, Belfast has significantly a ffected the British military campaign for stabilizing the area. British operations in Belfast illustrate the difficulty of balancing the security and protecting forc es with maintaining the stabilizing presence necessary to uphold law and order, minimize violence, and control the urban population. British successes in protecting Belfast’s infrastructure and government facilities from terrorist attacks compelled various terrorist cells, especially the Irish Repub- lican Army and the Provisional Irish R epublican Army, to attack more military targets. At the time, British soldiers and bases presented relatively unprotected targets to these factions, and attacks agains t them solidified their legitimacy as an “army.” In response, British comm anders implemented extreme security and force protection measures—from ballis tic protection vests and helmets to fortress-like operational bases and large uni t patrols. These protection measures 8-9"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ successfully decreased the violence against Br itish soldiers in Belfast. However, they also decreased the soldiers’ intera ction with the population and their ability to stabilize the city. The large patrols, while protecting the soldiers, inhibited effective saturation of neighborhoods. These patrols, coupled with fortress-like bases and bulky protective clothing, created an “us-versus-them” mentality among civilians and soldiers. As force protection increased and stabiliz ing effects decreased, the terrorists were provided more targets of opportunity among the civilians and infrastructure. British commanders reassessed the situati on, identified this “see-saw” effect, and adapted to strike a better balance bet ween force protection and effective presence patrols. For example, British forces switched to four-man patrols to enable greater mobility and wore berets instead of helmets to appear less aggressive. Participating Organizations and Agencies 8-24. Across the spectrum of urban operations, but m ore so in these opera- tions, num erous NGOs may be involved in relieving adverse hum anitarian conditions. Dense populations and infrastructure make an urban area a likely headquarters location for them. In 1994 during OPERATION UPHOLD DEMOCRACY, for example, over 400 civilian agencies and relief organizations were operating in Haiti. T herefore, com manders assess all significant NGOs and governmental agen cies operating (or likely to operate) in or near the urban area to include their— • Functions, purposes, or agendas. • Known headquarters and operating locations. • Leadership or senior points of co ntact (including telephone numbers). • Com munications capabilities. • Potential as a source fo r critical information. • Financial abilities and constraints. • Logistic resources: transportation, energy and fuel, food and water, clothing and shelter, and em ergency medical and health care services. • Law enforcem ent, fire fighting, and search and rescue capabilities. • Refugee services. • Engineering and construction capabilities. • Other unique capabilities or expertise. • Previous m ilitary, m ultinational, and interagency coordination exper- ience and training. • Rapport with the urban population. • Relationship with the m edia. • Biases or prejudices (especially towa rds participating US or coalition forces, other civilian organizations, or elem ents of the urban society). Com manders then seek to determ ine the resources and capabilities that these organizations m ay bring and the possible problem areas to include resources or assistance they will likel y need or request from Arm y forces. 8-10 "},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":" Urba n Sta bility Ope rations and Support Ope rations SHAPE 8-25. Commanders conduct many activi ties to shape the conditions for successful decisive operations. In ur ban stability operations and support operations, two rise to the forefront of importance: aggressive IO and security operations. Vigorous Information Operations 8-26. IO, particularly psychological operations (P SYOP ) and the related activities of civil affairs (CA) and pub lic affairs, are essential to shape the urban environm ent for the successful conduct of stability operations and support operations. Vigorous IO can infl uence the perceptions, decisions, and will of the threat, the urban population, and other groups in support of the com mander’s mission. IO obj ectives are translated to IO tasks that are then executed to create the com mander’s desired effects in shaping the battlefield. These operations can isolate an urban threat from his sources of support; neutralize hostile urban populations or gain the support of neutral popu- lations; and mitigate the effects of thre at IO, mi sinformati on, rumo rs, confusion, and apprehension. Security Operations 8-27. Protecting Civilians. Security for NGOs and civilians m ay also be an im portant shaping operation, particularly for support operations. Com - manders m ay need to provide security to civil agencies and NGOs located near or operating in the urban area so that these agencies can focus their relief efforts directly to the em ergency. Com manders m ay also need to protect the urban population and infrastructure to m aintain law and order if the urban area’s security or police force s are nonexistent or incapacitated. 8-28. Preserving Resources. Just as forces are at risk during urban stability operations or support operatio ns, so are their resources. In urban areas of great need, supplies and equipm ent are extrem ely valuable. Crim inal elem ents, insurgent forces, and people in need m ay try to steal weapons, am munition, food, construction material, m edical supplies, and fuel. P ro- tecting these resources may become a cri tical shaping operation. Otherwise, Army forces and supporting agencies ma y lack the resources to accomplish their prim ary obj ectives or overall m ission. Prioritize Resou rces an d Efforts 8-29. Urban com manders will always face lim ited resources with which to shape the battlefield, conduct their deci sive operations, and accom plish their objectives. They prioritize, allocate, an d apply those resources to achieve the desired end state. Especially in urban support operations, they tailor their obj ectives and shape their operations to achieve the greatest good for the largest number. Commanders first apply the urban fundamental of preserving critical infrastructure to re duce the disruption to the residents’ health and welfare. Second, they appl y the urban fundam ental of restoring essential services, which includes priori tizing their efforts to provide vital services for the greatest num ber of inhabitants possible. 8-11"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ 8-12 DOMINATE If there is any lesson to be derived from the work of the regular troops in San Francisco, it is that nothing can take the place of training and discipline, and that self-control and patience are as important as courage. Brigadier General F rederick F unston commenting on the Army ’s assistance follow ing the 1906 San F rancisco earth q uake and fire 8-30. The focus of the Arm y is warfighting. Therefore, when Arm y commanders conduct many urban stability operations and support operations, they adj ust their concept of what it me ans to domi nate . Com manders will most often find them selves in a supporting role and less often responsible for conducting the decisive operations. T hey accept this supporting function and capitalize on the professional values instilled in each soldier, particularly the sense of duty to do what needs to be done despite difficulty, danger, and personal ha rdship. Commanders also put accom- plishing the overall mission ahead of individual desires to take the lead  desire often fulfilled by being the supported rather than supporting commande r. Success may be described as settlement rather than victory . Ye t, the Arm y’s professionalism and values—com bined with inherent adapta- bility, aggressive coordination, persev erance, reasonable restraint, and reso- lute legitim acy—will allow Arm y forces to dom inate during com plex urban stability operations and support operations. Adaptability 8-31. Adaptability is cri- tical to urban stability operations and support operations because these operations relentlessly present com plex chal- lenges to commanders for which no prescribed solu- tions exist. Com manders often lack the experience and training that provide the basis for creating the unique solutions required for these oper ations. Since the prim ary purpose for the Army is to fight and win the nation’s wars, the challenge then is to adapt urban warfighting skills to the unique stability or support situation. Tenets of Ar my Opera tions Figure 8-3. Adaptability 8-32. Doctrine (j oint and Arm y) provides an inherent cohesion am ong the leaders of the Arm y and other services. Still, Arm y com manders conducting urban stability operations or support operations will often work with and support other agencies that have dissim ilar purposes, methods, and professional languages. Arm y com manders then capitalize on three of the five doctrinal tenets of Arm y operations: initiative, agility, and versatility (see Figure 8-3 and FM 3-0).

Aggressive Coordination 8-33. In urban stability operations an d support operations, the increased num ber of participants (both m ilitary and nonm ilitary) and divergent missions and m ethods create a significant coordination challenge. Significant potential for duplicated effort and working at cross-purposes exists. T he success of UO often depends on es tablishing a successful working relationship with all groups operatin g in the urban area. T he absence of unity of com mand am ong civil and m ilitary organizations does not prevent commanders from influencing other part icipants not under his direct com- mand through persuasion, good le adership, and innovative ideas. Support of and Coordination w ith Civilian Authorities: The 1992 Los Angeles Riots During the spring of 1992, soldiers from the 40th Infantry Division, California National Guard were among the forces depl oyed to Los Angeles County to assist the California Highway Patrol, Los A ngeles County Sheriffs, and civilian law enforcement. They worked to quell the riots that were sparked by the “not guilty” verdicts concerning four police office rs who, following a lengthy high-speed chase through Los Angeles, were accus ed of brutally beating Rodney King. Successful accomplishment of this suppor t operation was attributed to the exer- cise of strong Army leadership and judgment at lower tactical levels, particularly among the unit’s noncommissioned officers. An essential component of combat power, it was especially critical in executing noncontiguous and decentralized operations in the compartmented terrain of Los Angeles. As important, however, was the clear understanding that Army fo rces were to support civilian law enforcement—and not the other way around. The 40th Infantry Division aligned its area of operations with local la w enforcement boundaries and relied heavily on police recommendations for the level at which soldiers be armed (the need for magazines to be locked in weapons or rounds chambered). One incident emphasized the need for c oordination of command and control measures with civilian agencies even at the lowest tactical levels. To civilian law enforcement and Army forces, the comm and “Cover me” was interpreted the same: be prepared to shoot if necessary. However, when a police officer responding to a complaint of domestic abuse issued that command to an accom- panying squad of Marines, they responded by immediately providing a supporting base of fire that narrowly missed some children at home. However, the Marines responded as they had been trained. This command meant something entirely different to them than for Army soldie rs and civilian law enforcement. Again, coordination at all levels is critical to the success of the operation (see also the vignette in Appendix B). 8-34. In the constraints imposed by METT-TC and o peratio ns se curity (OPSEC), com manders seek to coordinate all tactical stability operations with other agencies and forces that share the urban environm ent. Com manders 8-13"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ strive to overcome difficulties, such as m utual suspicion, different values and motivations, and varying m ethods of organization and execution. Frequently, they initiate cooperative efforts with participating civilian agencies and determ ine where their obj ectives and plans complement or conflict with those agencies. Com manders then m atch Arm y force capabilities to the needs of the supported agencies. In situations lead ing to many urban support operations, confusion may initially m ake it difficult to ascertain specific priority require- ments. Reconnaissance and liaison elem ents—heavily weighted with CA and health support personnel—may need to be deployed first to determine what type of support Arm y forces provide. Overall, aggressive coordination will make unity of effort possible in urban stability operations or support opera- tions where unity of com mand is difficult or im possible to achieve. Perseverance 8-35. The society is a m ajor factor responsible for increasing the overall dura- tion of urban operations. This particularly applies to urban stability opera- tions and support operations where success often depends on changing people’s fundamental beliefs and subs equent actions. Modifying behavior requires influence, som etim es with c oercion or control, and perseverance. They often m ust be convinced or persua ded to accept change. This may take as long or longer than the evolution of the conflict. Decades of problem s and their consequences cannot be immediatel y corrected. Frequently, the affected segm ents of the urban society m ust s ee that change is lasting and basic problem s are being effectively addressed. 8-36. In m ost stability operations, success will not occur unless the host nation, not Army forces, ultimately pr evails. The host urban administration addresses the underlying problem s or re vises its policies toward the disaffec- ted portions of the urban population. Otherwise, apparent successes will be short lived. The UO fundamental of understanding the human dimension is of param ount im portance in applying this consideration. After all Arm y forces, particularly com manders and staff of m ajor operations, understand the society’s history and culture, they can begin to accurately identify the problem , understand root causes, and plan and execute successful Arm y UO. Reasonable Restraint 8-37. Unlike offensive and defensive operations where com manders seek to apply overwhelm ing com bat power at decisive points, restraint is m ore essential to success in urban sta- bility operations and sup- port operations. It involves employing combat power selectively, discrim inately, and precisely (yet still at decisive points) in accor- dance with assigned 8-14 "},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":" Urba n Sta bility Ope rations and Support Ope rations missions and prescribed legal and policy lim itations. Sim ilar to the UO fundamentals of minimizing collate ral damage and preserving critical infrastructure, restraint entails restri ctions on using force. Com manders of major operations issue or supplem ent ROE to guide the tactical application of combat power. Excessively or arbitrar ily using force is never justified or tolerated by Arm y forces. Even unintentionally injuring or killing inhabitants and inadvertently destroying their property and infrastructure lessens legitimacy and the urban popula tion’s sympathy and support. It may even cause som e inhabitants to becom e hostile. In urban stability operations and support operations, even force agai nst a violent opponent is minimized. Undue force often leads to com manders applying ever-increasing force to achieve the sam e results. 8-38. Although restraint is essential, Arm y forces, prim arily during urban stability operations, are always capable of lim ited com bat operations for self- defense. This is in accordance with the UO fundam ental of conducting close com bat. This com bat capability is present and visible, yet displayed in a nonthreatening manner. A commander’s intent normally includes demonstra- ting strength and resolve without pr ovoking an unintended response. Arm y forces are capable of moving quickly through the urban area and available on short notice. When necessary, Army forces are prepared to apply combat power rapidly, forcefully, and decisively to prevent, end, or deter urban con- frontations. Keeping this deterrent viable requires readiness, constant training, and rehearsals. It also requ ires active reconnaissance, superb OPSEC, a com bined arm s team , and tim ely and accurate intelligence, which in the urban environm ent requires a well-developed HUMINT capability. Resolute Legitimacy 8-39. Closely linked to restraint is legiti macy or the proper exercise of auth- ority for reasonable purposes. Achievin g or m aintaining legitim acy during urban stability operations or support oper ations is essential in obtaining the support of its population. Com manders can ensure legitim acy by building consent am ong the population, proj ecting a credible force, and appropriately using that force. Perceptions play a key role in legitim acy, and skillful IO can shape perceptions. Commanders send messa ges that are consistent with the actions of their forces. Generally, the urban population will accept violence for proper purposes if that force is us ed im partially. Perceptions that force is excessive or that certain groups are being favored over others can erode legitim acy. A single soldier’s misbeh avior can significantly degrade a com- mander’s ability to project an im age of im partiality and legitim acy. TRANSITION 8-40. Com manders of m ajor operations are the focal point for synchronizing tactical stability operations and support operations with strategic diplom atic and political issues. They are also the critical links between national intelli- gence resources and the tactical comma nder. Because strategic, diplomatic, and political changes can quickly transiti on the type of urban operation, they keep subordinate tactical com manders abreast of changes in intelligence, policy, and higher decisions. The pote ntial to rapidly transition to urban com bat operations em phasizes the need to m aintain the capability to conduct 8-15"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ close, urban combat. Failure to recogn ize changes and transition points may lead to UO that do not support the attainm ent of the overall obj ective and needlessly use resources, particularly soldiers’ lives. Therefore, Arm y forces on the ground in an urban stability oper ation are m ore aware of the strategic environm ent than the threat and the civilian population, each of whom will have their own means of monitoring the national and international situation. Legitimate and Capable Civilian Control 8-41. Com manders m aintain or enhance the credibility and legitim acy of the governm ent and police of the urban area and of the host nation’s m ilitary forces operating there. In accordance with the urban fundam ental of transi- tioning control, urban commanders co nclude UO quickly and successfully, often to use assets elsewhere in thei r area of operations. T his entails returning the control of the urban area back to civilian responsibility as soon as feasible. The host nation’s militar y and the urban area’s leadership and police are integrated into all aspects of the urban stability operations or support operations to m aintain their legitim acy. They are allowed (or influenced) to take the lead in deve loping and implementing solutions to their own problem s. 8-42. If the host nation’s leadership, military, and police are not up to the task, com manders can take steps to incre ase its capabilities through training, advice, and assistance by CA units or by other nongovernm ental or govern- mental organizations and agencies. Sometimes, new leadership and a restructured police force may be requir ed, particularly when corrupt and no longer trusted by the population. This candid assessm ent of the urban leader- ship’s ability to govern, protect, and support itself is m ade early in the planning process. Only then can co mmanders ensure that resources and a well thought-out and coordinated plan (particularly with civilian organizations) are available for a speedy transition. IO will be param ount in these instances to ensure that the urban population sees the training and rebuilding process itself as legitim ate. Throughout ur ban stability operations and support operations, com manders shape the conditions to successfully hand over all activities to urban civilian authorities. Longer-Term Commitment 8-43. Many stability operations often re quire perseverance and a longer-term US commitment requiring a rotation of Army units into the area of operations to continue the m ission. Co nsiderations for these transitions are sim ilar to a relief in place (see FM 3-90) com bined with considerations for deployment and redeployment. FM 41-10 contains a comprehensive appendix on transition planning and coordinati on activities applicable to UO. T he com mander of the m ajor operation ensures that the incom ing unit under- stands the political and strategic objectives behind the tasks that they accomplish. Otherwise, the new unit may begin to plan operations that are similar to those conducted by the prev ious unit without achieving the desired end state or accom plishing the m ission. 8-16 "},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"Chapter 9 Urban Combat Service Support Even supply is different. While deliveries do not need to be made over great distances, soft vehicles are ex tremely vulnerable in an environ- ment where it is hard to define a front line and where the enemy can repeatedly emerge in the rear.

Sustaini ng operations are inseparable from decisive and shaping operations. In offensive and defensive operations, they are not by themselves lik ely to be decisive or shaping; however, they contribute to those operations.

Their success will allow Army forces to dominate this complex environment. However, like all urban operations (UO), CSS operations affect and are affected by the environment. The urban terrain, infra- structure, and existing resources, co upled with supportive civilians, may facilitate CSS operations. In contra st, a poorly designed or damaged infrastructure and a hostile populati on may severely hamper CSS opera- tions. In the latter case, critical Army resources required elsewhere in the area of operations (AO) may be dive rted to repair facilities and control and support the inhabitants of the urban areas. URBAN CSS CHARACTERISTICS 9-1. CSS characteristics (see Fig- ure 9-1) guide prudent logistic planning regardless of the environ- ment. They provide com manders an excellent fram ework to analyze and develop urban logistic require- ments, assess the impact of the environm ent on the provision of CSS, and gauge the effectiveness of urban CSS suppo rt. RESPONSIVENESS AND SUSTAINABILITY 9-2. UO require responsiveness and sustainability to establish and maintain the tempo necessary for success. Responsiveness— providing the right support in the right place at the right time—is the esse ntial CSS characteristic. It requires that CSS commanders and planners accu rately forecast urban operational requirem ents. Continuous urban operatio ns will drain personnel, equipm ent, and supplies (based on history, this can be more than five times that experienced in other environm ents). Th erefore, sustainability—the ability to maintain continuous support throughout all phases of the operation—will be a significant concern. Anticipation is critical to both responsiveness and sus- tainability. It requires that CSS com manders and planners com prehend the potential effects that the com ponents of the urban environm ent (terrain, infrastructure, and society) may have on operations and CSS, either bene- fiting or im peding UO. Effective urban operational and logistic planning cannot be accomplished separately. Opera tional and CSS planners, as well as CSS operators, are closely linked to aid in synchronizing and attaining responsiveness and sustainability.

Econom y is providing 9-2"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":" Urba n Comba t Se rvice Support the most efficient support at the le ast cost to accomplish the mission. Attainability means generating the m inim um essential supplies and services necessary to begin operations. If avail able, obtaining support in the AO costs less than purchasing the supplies outside the area and then transporting them there. Critical resources m ay be available in urban areas to support the operation. However, relying on sou rces outside the established m ilitary logistic system m ay create conflict with other CSS characteristics. A strike by longshorem en, for exam ple, m ay shut down port operations (at least tempo- rarily) lowering responsiveness and sustainability. SURVIVABILITY 9-4. Survivability is being able to prot ect support functions from destruction or degradation. Com manders often choos e to locate CSS functions in an urban area because the buildings may better protect and conceal equipm ent, supplies, and people. Urban industrial areas are frequently chosen as support areas because they offer th is protection as well as sizeable warehouses, large parking areas, and materials handling equipment (MHE). Such areas facilitate the storage and m ovem ent of equipm ent and supplies. They also provide readily available wate r, electricity, and other potentially useful urban resources and infrastruc ture. However, these areas may also contain toxic industrial materials (TI M) (see the discussion of industrial areas in Chapter 2). These materials and chem icals in close proxim ity to support areas may unjustifiably increase th e risk to survivability, especially any CSS facilities located in subsurfa ce areas (liquids and heavier gases often sink and accum ulate in low-lyin g areas). Furtherm ore, CSS activities located in any type of confined urban areas can offer lucrative targets for terrorists or even angry crowds and mo bs. Although host-nation support may include assets to assist in defendin g CSS units and lines of communications (LOCs), CSS com manders carefully consider if adequate protection measures can ensure survivability. Base Security : Tan Son Nhut, Vietnam – Tet 1968 Colonel Nam Truyen was the commander of the 9th Vietcong Division who planned and conducted the attack on the US ai rbase at Tan Son Nhut during the 1968 Tet Offensive. He had previously entered the airbase during the 1967 Christmas cease-fire using forged i dentity papers to conduct his own personal reconnaissance. SIMPLICITY 9-5. Sim plicity is required in both pl anning and executing CSS operations in this complex environment. Developing standard procedures am ong the Arm y, other services, and especially civilia n governm ental and nongovernm ental agencies; of liaison and open channe ls of com munication; between sim ple plans and orders; and extensive rehe arsals contribute immeasurably to attaining this necessary characteristic. 9-3"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ INTEGRATION 9-6. The need for CSS integration incre ases in urban operations due to the joint nature of UO and greater numbe rs of other governmental and non- governm ental agencies operating in or near urban areas. More nongovern- mental organizations (NGOs) will likely exist because urban areas often con- tain most of a region’s population. Most NGOs focus on people. Arm y forces and other m ilitary and nonm ilitary grou ps cooperate and coordinate their actions. Much of their coordination w ill revolve around logistics. Cooperation and coordination will take advantage of each group’s logistic capabilities, help to avoid duplicated effort (contributing to econom y), and create logistic synergy. It will also help to curtail com petition for the sam e urban resources and assist in developing a unified list of prioriti es. Such coordination will help ensure that other operations by one force or agency will not disrupt or destroy portions of the urban infrastructure cri tical to another’s logistic operations and the overall m ission. (See the discu ssion of coordination with other agencies included at the end of Chapter 4. ) FLEXIBILITY 9-7. Lastly, com manders develop flexibility. Although they and their staffs thoroughly understand the urban environment essential to planning CSS operations, they cannot anticipate every eventuality. Urban com manders possess the ability to exploit fleeting opportunities. Knowledge of the environm ent, particularly its infrastruc ture, can aid in developing innovative solutions to CSS acquisition and dist ribution problem s. Flexibility enables CSS personnel to remain responsive to the force com mander’s needs. 9-8. The force and CSS commanders cons ider and prioritize these charac- teristics as they visualize UO. Each characteristic does not affect every operation and urban area in the same way. The CSS characteristics seldom exert equal influence, and their im portance varies according to mission, enem y, terrain and weather, troops and support available, time available, civil considerations (METT-TC). Like th e principles of war, com manders do not ignore the potential im pact of CSS characteristics and how their influence changes as the operation evolves (see FM 100-10). LOGISTICS PREPARATION OF THE THEATER 9-9. A tho rough logistics pre paratio n o f the the ater (LPT) is critical fo r an adaptable UO lo gistic suppo rt plan. CSS planne rs co nduct the LPT to assess the situation from a logistic perspect ive and determine how best to support the force commander’s plan. CSS pla nners understand the urban environ- ment, the fundam entals of UO, and the urban environm ent’s effects on com - bat service support (as well as the other battlefield operating system s). Such knowledge allows the planners to de velop a detailed estimate of support require ments. A tho rough LPT he lps co mmande rs de termine the mo st e ffe c- tive method of providing adequate, responsive support to m eet support esti- mates while minim izing the CSS footprint. Overall, it helps tie together UO requirem ents with acquisition and dist ribution. As with all operations, but particularly in a dynam ic urban environm ent, this assessm ent process is con- tinuous since requirem ents will change as the urban operation unfolds and mature s. 9-4"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":" Urba n Comba t Se rvice Support 9-5 SUPPORT TO IPB CSS planning accounts for increased consumption, increased threats to lines of communications, and anticipated support to noncombatants. . . . Urban operations place a premium on closely coordinated, combined arms teams and carefully protected CSS. Urban opera- tions are CSS-intensive, demanding large quantities of material and support for military forces and noncom- batants displaced by operations. FM 3-0 9-10. The LPT re semble s and runs parallel to the intelligence preparation of the battlefield (IPB). Products generated under IPB m ay be useful in the logistic analysis. Co nve rsely, the LPT may contribute to the IPB by identifying critical resources and infrastructure and assessing their potential to influence (posi- tively or negatively) the opera- tion plan. This inform ation m ay warrant a course of action that includes offensive or defensive operations to seize, secure, or destroy those critical resources. In UO initially planned for other than logistic reasons, the inform ation m ay require altering the plan or imposing additional constraints to protect the identified resources. These resources may or may not be critical to current operations; they are usually important to set or shape the conditions necessa ry for Army forces to transition to subsequent m issions or redeploy.

URBAN LOGISTIC INFORMATION 9-11. Figure 9-2 illustrates that a thorough analysis of the key com ponents of urban areas in the com- mander’s AO provides the data fo r an accurate LPT and subsequent UO logis- tic support plan (see Chap- ter 2 and Appendix B).

POTENTIAL RESTRICTIONS 9-12. Commanders are aware of restrictio ns that apply to the use of some non-US resources. Security and requirem ents for US national control dictate that only US assets m ay perform certain services and functions. Therefore, some foreign urban area capabilities, even if abundantly available, m ay not be used. These m ight include— • Com mand and control of m edical supply, service, maintenance, replacements, and communications. • Triage of casualties for evacuation. • Treatm ent of nuclear, biological, an d chemical (NBC) casualties, as well as the decontam ination of US eq uipment, personnel, and remains. • Identification and burial of US dead. • Veterinary subsistence inspection. • Law and order operations over US forces and US m ilitary prisoner con- finem ent operations, as well as accountability and security of enem y prisoners of war in US custody. URBAN SOCIETAL CONSIDERATIONS 9-13. As in all aspects of UO, the urban society is a critical elem ent of the LPT analysis. CSS planne rs canno t simply de termine what urban re source s exist in the AO. They also assess whether they can acquire and use those resources without overly disrupting th e urban society and their environm ent. If the resources are only sufficient for its inhabitants (and dependent popula- tions in outlying areas), and the facilities cannot increase production to accom modate the needs of Arm y forces, then com manders m ay not rely on those resources to support their operatio ns. In fact, the opposite may be true. The effects of UO on the inhabitants, particularly during offensive and defen- sive operations, may place increased burdens on the Arm y’s resources. Logis- tics civilian augm entation program (LOGCAP) contractors represent a poten- tial source of critical LPT planning info rmatio n. LOGCAP contracto rs may already have an e stablished presence in the urban area and can provide real- tim e inform ation on potential resource s. In some UO, especially support operatio ns, the LPT analysis is e sse ntial in de termining the re source s that com manders supply and the services they restore to accom plish the m ission. 9-14. CSS planners also consider the urban society’s ability to restore their own facilities and provide for them selves (if necessary with assistance from Army forces). Throughout this analysis, civil affairs (CA) units can advise and assist in identifying and assessing urban supply systems, services, personnel, resources, and facilities. Critically, com manders understand that purchasing local goods and services may have the unintended consequence of financially sustaining the m ost disruptive and violent factions in the area. Arm y forces seek to purchase urban products and se rvices that will not contribute to prolonging the conflict or crisis. In m any stability operations or support operations, they also attempt to di stribute the contracts for goods and 9-6"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":" Urba n Comba t Se rvice Support services purchased locally as fairly as possible among urban factions and ethnic groups to m aintain im partiality and legitim acy. As part of their coordination efforts, com manders attem pt to achieve the cooperation of relief agencies and other NGOs in this endeavor. 9-15. Finally, CSS planners also iden tify potential threats and increased protection requirem ents that the urban society (crim inals, gangs, and riotous mobs) may present, particularly when C SS units and activities are located in urban areas. T he disposition or allegian ce of the urban population is also important to consider. The infrastructure of an urban area may exhibit great potential to support the logistic efforts of Arm y forces, but if the population is hostile or unreliable, the re sources may be unavailable. SUPPORT AREAS 9-16. A m ajor influence on the operation plan and its subsequent execution is often the pro per ide ntificatio n and pre paratio n o f suppo rt are as. The LPT helps com manders determ ine the need, advantages, and disadvantages of using urban areas in the AO as areas from which to provide support and conduct distribution operations. Ideally, these areas support reception, staging, onward movem ent, and integration operations. They allow easy sea and air access, offer adequate protecti on and storage space, facilitate the transfer of supplies and equipm ent, and are accessible to m ultiple L OCs. Consequently, commanders often establis h support areas near seaports and airports that are part of a larger ur ban area. However, threats recognize the Army’s need for ports and airfields an d may devote substantial resources and com bat power to defend them . Therefor e, planners may determine during the LPT that the risks o f se izing o r establishing urban lo dgme nt are as may be too high (see Chapter 4). Instead, they m ay recom mend building an airfield, conducting logistics over-the-shore oper ations, or constructing logistic bases in m ore isolated locations. OVERALL ASSESSMENT 9-17. As sho wn abo ve, the LPT pro cess and analysis he lp to determine if urban areas in the AO— • Are suitable as areas for support. • Can contribute sufficient quantities of and are a dependable source for resources for the overall operation. • May additionally drain the suppo rted commander’s resources. The results of this process serve as a basis for reviewing requirements for civilian contract support and host-nat ion support and for developing CSS input into time-phased force and deploy ment data. This chapter focuses on the effects urban areas m ay have on a ccomplishing CSS functions and related activities, particularly when CSS units and activities are in urban areas. CSS FUNCTIONS 9-18. CSS consists of m ultiple function s necessary to fuel, arm, fix, and man com bat system s. Sim ilar to the com ponents of the urban environm ent, particularly its infrastructure, they overlap and are interdependent (see Figure 9-3 on page 9-8). The success of one function depends on the success of 9-7"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ several others. Like urban infra- structure, they have two com po- nents: a physical component (supplies, equipm ent, and facili- ties) and a human component (the personnel who execute these functions). Like city m a y o r s , co mmande rs pl an, manage, and synchronize these functions to provide responsive and effi- cient CSS for UO. 9-19. Commanders and planners consider two essential aspects when addressing these CSS func- tions. One aspect looks outward and one looks i nward. The first aspect is how these functions can best support full-spectrum UO—the outward analysis. The second aspect is how the urban area affects the conduct of CSS functions, particularly when those func tions are located or perform ed in an urban area—the inward analysis.

CSS Functions SUPPLY 9-20. The supply function involves acquiring, m anag- ing, receiving, storing, pro- tecting, m aintaining, sal- vaging, and distributing all classes of supply (except Class VIII) required to equip and sustain Army (and joint) forces. In UO, com manders of m ajor opera- tions m ay need to m ake decisions early in the plan- ning cycle. They decide whether to stockpile sup- plies forward or to rely on velocity m anagem ent and scheduled and tim e-definite delivery to satisfy requirem ents. Som e specialized item s identified below m ay not be available through the norm al m ilitary supply system and m ay take logisticians much longer to obtain or fabricate. Operation planners quickly identify the special equipm ent and increased supply requirem ents for UO to give logisticians time to acquire them. Greater friendly force density would appear to make the providers’ task easier. Logic would seem to dictate that more supported units in less space would translate to fewer nodes that require support, or at least less distance between a similar number of nodes than would be found on more open terrain. But the service supporter frequently finds the opposite is the case. . . . one is often not directly accessible from another due to enemy fires or physical bar riers. On the Shoulders of Atla s Increas ed Urban Supply Requirements 9-21. Urban offensive and defensive op erations will often increase require- ments for Class V. Ammunition consumpt ion rates have been five to ten tim es greater than operations in other environm ents. As such, urban com bat operations will require a constant flow of am munition. These operations will 9-8"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":" Urba n Comba t Se rvice Support require more small arms and heavy ma chine guns; tank, antitank, mo rtar, attack helicopter, and field artillery am munition (especially precision muni- tio ns); and mine s, gre nade s, and de mo litio ns. 9-22. With the potential exception of aviation fuel, Class III requirements for UO generally decrease at the m aneuver unit level. Increased fuel require- ments for engineer and power-generating equipm ent attached to or operating with forward units m ay offset these decreases. However, units may obtain tested fuel in the urban area (refinem ent facilities, gas stations, garages, and airfields). 9-23. Class IV will be in great dem and in all types of UO to include large quantities of lum ber (and the power tool s to cut it) to reinforce positions and to bar access to windows and doorways. This lum ber m ay com e from outside the urban area or obtained by dism ant ling existing buildings and structures. Army forces use discretion , m inim izing collateral da mage, preserving critical infrastructure, and understanding the human dimension before they disas- sem ble buildings. Som e structures m ay be required to support operations or the civilian population during subseque nt stages. Forces avoid structures of religious or cultural significance to prevent turning portions of the urban population against US operations and erode legitim acy. Other construction material will also be in high dem and during relief operations to repair buildings and infrastructure damaged during the disaster. Class IV may also include specialized, prefabricated road barriers or collapsible wire-m esh or fabric cribs that can be filled with sa nd, rock, or dirt. They create barricades used to block roads, reinforce defensiv e positions, and protect headquarters and logistic activities. 9-24. Across the spectrum of UO, pot able water may be a critical concern. Planners m ay need to ensure that addi tional containers for water (and fuel) are available to support dispersed stock at small-unit level. Units may need to increase levels of Class I and X supp lies to support the urban population, particularly in urban stability operatio ns and support operations. Soldiers may need m ore Class II, especially clothing and individual equipm ent, as exposure to the urban environm ent (con crete, glass, and steel) causes rapid wear. The chem ical threats posed in UO m ay require pre-positioning large stocks of chem ical protective clothi ng, defensive equipment, and decontami- nation apparatus. Units will also require item s such as rope, grappling hooks, crowbars, ladders, chain saws, elbow- and kneepads, special vehicle and personnel body armor, fire-fighti ng equipment, packboards, and other specialized item s to conduct operations. Storage and Distribution 9-25. UO that are prim arily stability op erations or support operations may be able to rely entirely upon the Arm y’s responsive, distribution-based CSS. Urban offensive and defensive operations can be part of an overall urban operation considered prim arily a stabilit y operation or support operation. In the past, these operations required bo th the attacker and the defender to prestock as many supplies as possible, particularly critical item s. Defending forces recognize that the attacker will s eek to isolate them from sources of supply; they ensure that they have enough supplies to execute the defense and restore their L OCs. Successful isolation of an urban area by the attacker 9-9"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ ultimately results in a supply shortage and defeat. Com plete isolation of a defender is difficult, especially if the urban area is large and the urban civilians support the defending forces. Nonetheless, attacking forces will seek, at a m inim um, to interdict the defender’s resupply operations. Although the isolation m ay be effectiv e and the defense eventually fails, stockpiling supplies in this situat ion contributes to the defense. 9-26. Attacking forces may also want to stockpile supplies. This assists in maintaining the necessary tem po for a successful urban offensive. It can reduce the frequency with which su pplies are m oved over exposed L OCs. Stockpiling for offensive operations is not as com mon a technique as in the defense. Com manders review if they ha ve the storage facilities and transpor- tation assets (equipment and personnel) available. 9-27. Com manders weigh the benefits of stockpiling resources forward against relying on the Arm y’s distribution-based sustainm ent system . Stock- piling brings supplies close to urban forces and helps ensure available sup- plies to support the tempo of UO. However, this method may burden the sup- port structure that moves, handles, and protects large quantities of resources often on a repetitive basis. The Army ’s normal distribution-based CSS reduces this burden significantly; howe ver, available transportation assets (sea, air, and ground) im pacts delivery response tim es. These transportation assets often com bine m ilitary assets over laid on the host nation’s (and urban area’s) transportation and distribution infrastructure. Although the civilian infrastructure may initially support the Arm y’s distribution system , later effects of UO, such as destruction of equipm ent and facilities or loss of civilian workers, m ay degrade the system . Arm y forces m ay have to share these assets with other m ilitary, civilia n, and m ultinational forces or organi- zations participating in the urban operat ion, as well as with civilians. This shared system also puts at risk the tim ely delivery of critical supplies to Army forces. 9-28. CSS planners understand the urban environment and its effects on the proposed m ethod of distribution. They also understand how urban operations (to include CSS UO) may affect the urban environm ent. Storing bulk fuel in or near an urban area, for exam ple, m ay increase the risk of fire hazard to civilians and Arm y forces. With this awareness, planners present the force commander with an estimate that considers both risks and benefits. Depending on the particular area and other MET T-TC factors, they may recom mend one method of distribution later transitioning to another or a com bination of m ethods. To be viable, the overall concept of logistic support, to include supply distribution, enabl es urban commanders to generate enough combat power to conduct decisive and shaping UO when and where required, and at a tempo faster than the threat can react. 9-29. During urban combat operations, the “push system” of supply distribu- tion often works best to maintain the tem po of UO. Under this system , planners estimate supply requirements and arrange to have supplies delivered in preset packages (norm ally strategic, m ission, unit, or com bat configured loads). This method prevents critical delays of a “pull system ” that requires units to request supplies and then await their arrival. The “best” method for tactical UO will be a com bination of the two. 9-10"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":" Urba n Comba t Se rvice Support FIELD SERVICES 9-30. Field services involve feeding, clothing, and providing personal services for soldiers. It consists of food servic es, mortuary affairs, aerial delivery, laundry, shower, and textile repair. The urban com mander determ ines the need and priority of each service after careful METT-TC analysis. Some facilities such as shower, laundry, and cold storage m ay be available in the urban area. Additionally, requirem ents to care for the urban population will increase requirem ents for field services imme nse ly. In so me circumstance s, most notably urban support operations, fi eld service units or activities will be critical and m ay be the only support provided. Food Preparation 9-31. The feeding standard for soldiers operating in urban areas remains the same: three quality meals per day. Urban combat makes higher energy demands on soldiers who require a calo ric intake of about 5,000 calories per day. Producing and delivering prepared m eals to forward elem ents may be im possible or may be im proved due to the urban environm ent. The area m ay contain facilities that aid in food storage and preparation that Arm y forces can use speeding transition to prepared rations. On the other hand, the threat situation (which may include the urban populace), rubble and other obstacles, and isolated and dispersed forces may prevent transporting and delivering prepared m eals even if the capability to prepare m eals is enhanced. Food (and water) may be available in the urban area; however, local sources must be tested, carefully monitored, and medically approved before consumption. Garbage disposal may be an important consideration in the urban area. Im proper trash disposal may leave a signature trail (particu- larly during urban defensive operations ) that m ay produce or worsen unsani- tary conditions leading to increased di sease and nonbattle injuries (DNBIs). Com manders understand that food operations, if not properly positioned and secured, can become a focal point fo r the urban population. Strict policy regarding distribution and control of any Class I supplies (including waste products) will be enforced. Black m arket eers will be attracted to Arm y food service activities as well (even during offensive and defensive operations). Water Purification 9-32. Water is essential; it is necessary for life, sanitation, food preparation, construction, and decontamination. Fu rnishing potable water is both a supply function and a field service. Water purification is a field service, norm ally perform ed with the storage and distribution of potable water—a supply function. 9-33. Vigilant Monitoring. Urban areas will often have a ready source of water to support the urban inhabitants and its infrastructure. However, this water may not be potable for US and allied forces (though the urban popula- tion may have developed immunity to ward its m icroorganism s). The higher concentration of TIM in urban areas compounds this problem, as ground water is highly susceptible to chemical contam ination, even supplies located miles away from the source of contam ination. US soldiers are trained and cautioned against using water from an urban area (to include ice and bottled water) until preventive medicine and ve terinary personnel can determine its 9-11"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ quality. When water quality is unknown, com manders ensure use of tactical water purification equipm ent that will unquestionably upgrade it to Arm y water quality standards. Even if initial testing indicates the urban water is safe for Army forces, personnel cont inuously monitor the water quality. However, Arm y water purification, storage, and transportation requirem ents for UO can be greatly reduced if the existing urban water supply can be integrated into CSS operations. An earl y assessm ent of the feasibility of this course of action is cri tical to CSS planning. 9-34. Greater Requirements. Individual water requirem ents are greater for soldiers operating in an urban environm ent due to increased levels of exertion. Offensive and defensive UO ar e often intense and can produce m ore casualties, including civilians. Conseque ntly, m edical facilities, already con- sum ers of large volum es of water, may require even more water. Water purification, particularly in the urban areas of developing nations and during urban disaster relief operations, will be a critical and constant concern for Army forces. 9-35. Potential Key Terrain. Sites that can control the water of the urban area m ay be key terrain, providing not only a resource for Army forces, but also a m eans to control the threat, the civilians, or both. These sites m ay be the sources of the water—the river, lake , reservoir, or storage tanks—or the means that process and transport the water—pipelines, pumping stations, or treatm ent facilities. Many sites m ay be outside the urban area, as m any large urban areas draw water from distant sources. The seizure of a pum ping station or pipeline m ay m ake it possi ble for commanders to control water supplies without expending resources re quired to enter the urban area. To preserve critical infrastructure, command ers m ay increase security to protect these locations from contam ination or destruction. Engineers also m ay need to restore, m aintain, or operate exis ting water facilities dam aged by the threat or disaster and to drill new we lls and construct new water facilities. Mortuary Affairs 9-36. Mortuary affairs provide the necessa ry care and disposition of deceased personnel. It supports the Arm y across the spectrum of operations. It may directly and suddenly im pact (positively or negatively) the m orale of the soldiers and the Am erican public an d may influence relations with the civilian population in the AO. It can also affect the health of soldiers and the urban populace. Commanders plan evac uation routes and tem porary collec- tion and internment sites, trying to ad here to local custom s and traditions to lessen potential negative consequences. 9-37. Units are responsible for recoveri ng the rem ains of their own fatalities and evacuating them to the closest m ortuary affairs collection point, usually located at the nearest support area. Be cause of the density of noncom batants in UO, com manders m ay also find them selves responsible for civilian rem ains. Deaths of civilians under Arm y control, such as urban evacuees and refugees at Army-operated sites, ofte n obligate the Arm y to care for their rem ains including m edical certification and records of death. High-intensity urban com bat m ay result in civilian deaths, and health concerns will require Arm y forces to deal with civilian rem ains expeditiously. Com manders consult local religious leaders, the Staff Judg e Advocate (SJA), CA personnel, and 9-12"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":" Urba n Comba t Se rvice Support chaplains to verify that they are abiding by law and customs. Overall, com manders ensure that forces treat a ll deceased, including civilians, with dignity and respect (another important aspect of adhering to the urban fundamental of understanding the human dimension). Aerial Delivery 9-38. Aerial delivery is the movement by fixed- or rotary-wing aircraft and delivery by the use of parachute or slin g load of soldiers, supplies, and equip- ment. As a vital link in the distribution system , it adds flexibility and provides the capability of supplying th e force even when urban ground LOCs are disrupted. Forces use aerial deliv ery to deliver supplies and equipment when no other m eans can. However, in support operations it is used exten- sively to move supplies to meet the urge nt needs of a population in crisis. In all UO, delivery aircraft are highly vulnerable to small arms, rockets, and air defense systems. A threat may further decrease an already limited number of urban drop zones (aircraft may be abl e to avoid air defense systems, but ground forces may not be able to secure the drop zone and retrieve the cargo). Equipment and supplies transported by helicopter sling-load lessen the latter disadvantage. There are usually m ore av ailable sites to deposit sling loads, such as rooftops (engineers will be cri tical in determ ining the structural integrity of rooftops for landing helicopte rs), parking lots, and athletic fields. However, load instability during flight m ay restrict a helicopter’s airspeed and m aneuver capabilities m aking it m ore vulnerable to sm all arm s and man-portable air defense system s. F or a ll these reasons, aerial delivery of supplies in UO m ay be m uch less effici ent than in m any other environm ents. Laundry, Shower, and Light Textile Repair 9-39. Soldiers are provided clean, serviceable clothing and showers for hygiene and m orale. A field services co mpany provides direct support at the tactical level. During UO, other sources such as fixed urban facilities obtained via host-nation support and contract services may provide these services. MAINTENANCE 9-40. Maintenance entails keeping m ateri el in operating condition, returning it to service, or updating and upgradin g its capability. It includes recovering and evacuating disabled equipm ent; re placing forward; performing preven- tive maintenance checks and servic es (PMCS); increasing battle dam age assessment and repair (BDAR); and anal yze potential resources for mainte- nance in the urban area. Rapid Recovery Es sential 9-41. Disabled vehicles easily bloc k narrow thoroughfares during urban offensive, defensive, and som e stability operations. This m akes rapid recovery operations essential. Hastily secured unit maintenance collection sites near the dam aged equipm ent and along supply routes are necessary to avoid clogging lim ited LOCs and m ounted avenues with vehicle evacuation opera- tions. The task organization of arm ored units into smaller attachments (often platoon-sized or sm aller) will strain lim ited recovery assets. Units m aintain centralized and responsive control over these potentially critical resources. 9-13"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ Replace Forward 9-42. One of the guiding m aintenance prin ciples is to replace forward and fix rear. Maintenance activities, with a forward focus on system replacem ent, task and use the distribution and evacuation channels to push com ponents and end item s to the sustainm ent level fo r repair. However, the conditions of UO m ay m ake distribution and evacuation difficult. Fixing equipm ent on site is extrem ely im portant in UO. Organizational m aintenance personnel accu- rately evaluate dam age to their equipm ent. Recovery of equipm ent will prove difficult. When recovery is required, eq uipment is moved only as far rearward as the point where repairs can be m ade. When selecting a m aintenance site, com manders consider: security, a sufficient area around equipm ent for lift or recovery vehicles, and use of existing m aintenance facilities or garages. 9-43. The unforgiving urban terrain will invar- iably increase damage to man-portable weapons and equipment, particu- larly electronic equip- ment sensitive to jarring. Although by definition man-portable weapons and equipment are easier to transport, evacuating these sys- tems may pro ve as diffi- cult as evacuating vehi- cles and larger, heavier equipm ent. T herefore, unit or direct support m aintenance support team s (MSTs) will frequently need to repair equipm ent at (or as near as possible to) the point where it was dam aged. Equipm ent operators are responsible to properly diagnose the fault or dam age. Such action ensures that the correct repair parts and mainte- nance personnel are sent forward to complete necessary repairs. In UO, particularly offensive and defensive op erations, units m ay need to replace rather than repair equipm ent, requirin g CSS personnel to plan for increased replacem ent of what m ight norm ally be repairable equipment, as well as increased repair parts for man-portable items. Add-On Protection Increases Wear 9-44. Maintenance units may need to attach additional armor to both wheeled and tracked vehicles operating in an urban environment to increase protection against sm all arm s, m ines, rocket-propelled grenades, and light- weight antiarmor weapons. (Units can also sandbag vehicles to achieve a degree of increased protection. ) These modified vehicles, however, may put excessive wear on brakes, springs, su spension, and tires (already vulnerable to the increased am ount of debris caus ed by many UO). After several months, these sam e vehicles m ay experience seve re damage to major assemblies, such as engines and transm issions. T he increased protection proportionally increases repair parts and com mand em phasis toward inspecting these item s 9-14"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":" Urba n Comba t Se rvice Support during daily operator PMCS. Com mander s em ploying this additional protec- tion m ay also consider increasing the num ber of scheduled services. Increased Battle Damage Assessmen t an d Rep air 9-45. In UO, operators, crews, MST s, and recovery team s execute BDAR far more than in other environm ents. BDAR quickly restores minim um essential com bat capabilities for a specific m ission (norm ally of short duration) or allows the equipm ent to self-recover by expediently fixing or bypassing com - ponents. Com manders m ay need to authorize supervised battlefield canniba- lization and controlled exchange when units lack critical parts or cannot bring them forward. Potential Urban Maintenance Res ources 9-46. Although urban areas can complicate maintenance, they may contri- bute to this CSS function. Analyzing the urban area in the commander’s AO may reveal potential sources of parts, tools, equipm ent, and facilities neces- sary to fix equipment and fabricate critical parts. Urban areas may serve as key sources for parts and facilities (and contract personnel) to repair auto- mation and network com munication equipm ent. TRANSPORTATION 9-47. Transportation supports the concept of the urban operation by moving and transferring units, soldiers, equipm ent, and supplies. Transportation in- corporates military, com mercial, supporting nation, and urban area capabili- ties to build a system that expands to m eet the needs of the force. Transpor- tation includes movement control, term inal operations, and m ode operations. 9-48. Urban areas are often critical to transportation operations. These areas may serve as a lodgm ent or support area for entry of Arm y forces and sus- tainm ent supplies. The existing transp ortation and distribution infrastruc- ture may be essential to reception, st aging, and onward movement. Contracts and host-nation support agreem ents m ay greatly increase the ability of Arm y forces to use the urban area’s facilities, which may include docks, airfields, warehouses, and cargo handling equipment. Urban support may also include skilled urban workers, such as longshorem en and MHE operators. Urban Terminals 9-49. In addition to serving as ma jor seaports and aerial ports of debarkation, other urban areas m ay provide additional term inals in the AO. Forces may use these terminals for furthe r staging, loading, discharging, and transferring the handling between various inland transportation modes and carriers (motor, air, rail, and water) . These urban terminals—with synchro- nized mo veme nt manage me nt—pe rmi t co mmande rs to rapi dly shi ft transpo r- tation modes and carriers. Such action increases flexibility and ensures the continued forward movement of equipm ent and supplies to influence the tac- tical situation. Movement control, part icularly in urban areas, relies heavily on support from military police in their m aneuver and m obility support role. Without this support, urban LOCs may become congested, hinder movement and maneuver, and degrade force effe ctiveness (see FM 3-19.4). Urban com- manders m ay need to establish m ultiple roadblocks and traffic control posts, 9-15"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ restrict selected roads to military traffic, and reroute movement to unaffected road networks when civil support and refugee control operations compete for available routes. Military police operations are critical in this regard and will require continuous, close coordination with urban civilian police. Obstacles to Ground Transportation 9-50. Although urban areas can contribu te to transportation operations, rubble and other damage can become obst acles to ground m ovem ent. Even in an undamaged urban environment, road and bridge weight restrictions may lim it transportation operations. Urban route maintenance, to include rein- forcing bridges, may become a priori ty task for engineer units. Bypassed pockets of resistance and ambushes pose a constant threat along urban supply routes. Urban LOCs will often require increased security in the form of continuous route security operatio ns, regular (daily, if necessary) mine clearance operations, num erous observation posts, and a larger, more mobile tactical combat force. Such security increases manpower requirem ents for sustaining operations and potentially reduces resources fr om decisive opera- tions. Moving critical supplies may requ ire heavily arm ed convoys or lightly arm ored vehicles instead of trucks. Dr ivers are well trained, rehearsed, and alert. They can recognize and avoid po tential mines and minefields (such as driving in the sam e tracks as the vehi cle in front) and can react rapidly to am bushes. (In addition to the m easures above, Russian convoys during their operations in Chechnya were not allowe d to move without attack helicopter escort and the availability of im mediat e close air support.) Aerial resupply alleviates problem s due to ground obst acles, but the air defense threat and proxim ity of threat forces m ay preclude their routine use. Population Effects 9-51. The ability of Arm y forces to use vital urban transportation facilities depends largely on the civilians and the threat. The civilian population can affect the transportation system if th ey do not support the goals of Arm y operations. Urban transportation systems—such as ports, railroads, and rivers—require many specialists to op erate. Without these specialists, the system ’s utility is degraded and m ay no t function at all. In urban stability operations or support operations, Arm y forces will share the system with civilians and other agencies. Civilian authorities m ay refuse to allow Arm y forces to use any portions of an urban area’s transportation system . Nego- tiating for access to that system under these circum stances then becom es a command priority. 9-16"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":" Urba n Comba t Se rvice Support Threat Effects 9-52. The threat can significantly affect urban transportation systems. Many are com posed of sm aller subsystem s. Ea ch subsystem is vulnerable to attack, which in turn often shuts down the whole system . A large canal system , for exam ple, m ay have entrance and exit facilities, the canal itself, a m eans to pull the vessel along such as a locom otive engine, and the civilians that run each of these subsystem s. Both an attacker and defender understand the components of the particular transportation system. If important to their current or subsequent operations, de fending forces then develop plans and allocate forces to protect these subsys tems. Attacking forces, on the other hand, often avoid collateral dam age to the system , while sim ultaneously preventing enem y destruction of the facilities. COMBAT HEALTH SUPPORT 9-53. Combat health support (CHS)— • Encompasses all activities that prevent DNBIs. • Clears the urban area of casualties. • Provides for forward medical treatment and en route care during medical evacuation. • Ensures that adequate Class VIII supplies and medical equipment are available. • Provides required veterinary, de ntal, and laboratory services. CHS operations m inim ize the effects of wounds, inj uries, disease, urban envi- ronmental hazards, and psychological stresses on unit effectiveness, readi- ness, and m orale. Effective UO require a cclim ated soldiers trained in specific urban tactics, techniques, and procedures. CHS helps m aintain the health of urban forces, thereby conserving that trained m anpower. This environm ent has had three to six times greater ca sualty rates than any other type environm ent. CHS operations that keep soldiers healthy and m edically cared for reduce the strain on the replacem ent and evacuation system s. Such care allows soldiers to concentrate on the task at hand instead of the increased risks associated with UO. 9-54. As part o f the overall LPT, co mmande rs and me dical planne rs analyze and continuously assess the urban area. They determ ine the medical threats, required m edical resources, and the quality and availability of m edical facili- ties and resources (to include civilia n m edical personnel). This assessm ent prevents duplicated services and perm its m ore effectively and efficiently organizing medical resources. An analys is m ay indicate available hospitals, clinics, m edical treatm ent facilities, and medical supplies and equipm ent (including production facilities) in the urban area. It m ay also indicate NGOs capable of providing m edical services and supplies. Stringent federal regula- tions, standards of medical care, and a need for unavailable advanced tech- nologies m ay lim it their use by Arm y forces. CHS personnel keep abreast of the operational situation and its im pact on CHS. P eace operations, for exam ple, may rapidly transition to high-intensity offensive and defensive operations requiring m edical support abl e to handle potential mass casualty scenarios. 9-17"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ Care of Civilians 9-55. In com bat operations, the m ilitar y norm ally does not provide injured civilians with medical care. Saving civilians is the responsibility of civilian authorities rather than the m ilitar y. However, based on METT-TC and requirem ents under Geneva Convention s, commanders may need to recover, evacuate, and treat num erous civilians (particularly in urban support opera- tions and som e stability operations) until the local civilian m edical personnel and facilities can be reconstituted and supplied. In urban support operations involving weapons of m ass destruction, the prim ary focus of Arm y support may be CHS. If com manders provide m edical support, they adhere to the UO fundam ental of transitioning control and transferring responsibilities for medical care of civilians to another agency or into civilian hands as soon as is practical. In UO, com manders consider and address the m edical treatm ent of civilians (enem y and friendly) early in the planning process. Any initial assessm ent or survey team s therefore contain CHS representatives. T his assessm ent also considers cultural fact ors related to civilian m edical treat- me nt. C ommande rs may ne ed to de velop sp ecific medical policies, directives, and standing operating procedures to ensure that subordinates know how much medical care they may provide to— • The urban population. • Other host-nation and third-country civilians. • Coalition and host-nation forces. • Contractor personnel. Disease and Nonbattle Injury 9-56. DNBI is a major m edical threat during all operations and UO will be no exception. Urban pollution hazard s and potential exposure to TIM may increase the risk to soldier health. Som e urban areas, particularly those in developing countries, are already larg e sources of com municable diseases, such as tuberculosis, cholera, typ hus, hepatitis, malaria, dengue, and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Physical damage or deteriora- tion of urban infrastructure—such as el ectricity, water, and sewage services and industries that use or produce hazardous materials—will only exacerbate these problem s creating greate r health risks. The density of the environm ent extends these risks to Arm y forces. Com manders establish a medical epidem iological surveillance system early. Such action continually assesses the health of the force and promptly identifies unusual or local occurrences that m ay signal preventive medicine problem s or the influence of biological or chem ical agents. T hese potential hazards, particularly the release of TIM, will influence the type of m edical supplies needed by medical personnel and will also necessitate cri tical planning and preparation for potential m ass casualties (civilian as well as m ilitary). 9-57. Adhering to the UO fundamental of preserving critical infrastructure may strongly influence decreasing DN BI. P reventive m edicine personnel identify the diseases and recom mend control and preventive m easures. In urban areas, particularly during suppo rt operations and stability operations (and when specifically authorized), they may also conduct civilian health screening, health education, and imm unization program s. Medical screening of military personnel, particularly m ultinational forces, m ay be required to 9-18"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":" Urba n Comba t Se rvice Support prevent introducing new diseases (especia lly drug-resistant strains) into an urban area. A new disease m ay tax the m edical system and introduce a new medical problem into an area already in crisis. Lastly, field sanitation training (to include training in the us e of barrier protection such as latex gloves when rendering care to any person and animal, rodent, and pest control), equipm ent, and supplies are part of overall preventive m edicine measures and considerations. Combat S tress 9-58. Stress occurs in every operation and type of environment; some stress is beneficial but too much is harmfu l. Controlled com bat stress can invoke positive, adaptive reactions such as loya lty, selflessness, and heroism. On the other hand, uncontrolled combat stre ss can result in negative, harmful behavior and combat stress casualties. Such behaviors and casualties—battle fatigue, misconduct stress behaviors, and post-traumatic stress disorder—can interfere with the unit’s m ission. P hysical and m ental factors leading to com bat stress result from the environm ent and the deliberate enem y actions aim ed at killing, wounding, or dem oralizing soldiers. However, m any stressors are also generated from the soldier’s own leaders and mission demands. Combat Stress Chechny a – 1994 to 1996 Russia’s 1994-1996 conflict with Chechnya, a republic in the southwestern part of the Russian Federation, produced an increased number of psychological trauma and combat stress casualties. O ne medical survey found 72 percent of the soldiers screened had some sort of psychological disorder symptoms. Of that, 46 percent exhibited asthenic depr ession (a weak, apathetic, or retarded motor state). The other 26 percent exhibi ted psychotic reactions such as high states of anxiety, excitement, or aggr essiveness and a deterioration of moral values or interpersonal relations. The statistics showed more troops experienced combat stress disorders than during thei r 1980s war in Afghanistan. One primary difference was that in Chechnya, Russi an forces conducted combat mostly in cities rather than in mountains , valleys, and other rural areas. Combat always invokes fear in soldiers. However, poor training and planning, uncertainty in their cause, and urban popul ations that resented their presence exacerbated the psychological climate for the Russian forces in Chechnya. Acts of subversion and terrorism by Chechen guerrillas kept the Russians in a con- stant, high state of readiness and anxiety ; the soldiers viewed every civilian— young or old, male or female—as a potential enemy. This psychological pressure was not simply a by-product, but an objec tive of information operations and a prime reason for taking the fight into the close confines of Chechnya’s urban areas. Torture and mutilation of prisoner s; immediate execution of captured pilots; imitative electromagnetic dec eption (Chechens mimicked Russian radio transmissions and directed Russian close air support against their own forces); and propaganda to convince civilians that Russia’s actions had a religious bias against Muslims and Islam were conduct ed to exert intense, unremitting psychological pressure on Russian forces—with great success. 9-19"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ The characteristics of urban areas comb ined with Chechen insurgent activities and information operations, civilians that did not welcome foreigners, and an unpopular and poorly supported conflict with an open-ended mission reinforced the need for the national will to str engthen and support the fight when forces deploy to urban areas. These characteristics also reinforce the need for clear objectives, proper leadership and training, and available medical assets able to properly diagnose and treat combat stress casualties. 9-59. In offensive and defensive UO, compartmented urban combat leads to physical isolation, difficulties in transmitting radio signals lead to communications isolation, and com bined they create an overwhelm ing sense of being alone. Snipers, mines, and booby traps com bined with the closeness and high intensity of urban combat contribute to an unremitting fear of attack from any quarter that further increases stress casualties. Additionally, seeing and perhaps accidentally inflicting casualties on civilians (especially women and children) increases battle fatigue. If civilians are hostile or a threat uses the population as cover and concealm ent, then the potential for m isconduct stress behaviors often increases. Urban areas m ay provide tem ptations for looting, alcohol and substance abuse, black marketeering, an d harmful social interactions; these tem ptations m ay increase m isconduct stress behaviors. Leaders can prevent or rapidly identify, successfully manage , and treat stress-related casualties (see FM 22-51 and FM 6-22.5) and prev ent misconduct stress behaviors as well as potential violations of the law of war. They provide training (both in urban combat and combat stress manageme nt), effective rules of engagem ent (ROE), unit cohesion, strong leadership , and mental health support. Leaders, forward on the battlefield, will determ ine whether discipline perseveres. Evacuation 9-60. Transportation restrictions may preclude evacuation of urban casual- ties. Consequently, units may require mo re litter bearers to move the injured to a point where they can be further ev acuated by ground or air ambulance. Lengthy evacuation routes will require m ore litter bearers, as m ultiple litter relay team s will be necessary to cons erve energy and expedite evacuation. However, unless augm ented or relieved of this responsibility by another unit, these litter bearers will com e from the casualties’ own unit thereby diminishing the unit’s strength levels necessary to accomplish its primary mission. Depending on the expected level of casualties, com manders may augment units with additional personnel to perform evacuation or m ay assign maneuver units this mission. Historic ally, urban offensive and defensive 9-20"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":" Urba n Comba t Se rvice Support operations experienced m ore casualties than these operations in other envi- ronm ents. Evacuation personnel will require specific training in urban evacuation techniques (m oving casualti es from subsurface and supersurface levels to and along the surface leve l). Overall, urban com manders at all echelons develop detailed medical evacua tion plans. Engineers are critical to clear routes for medical resupply and evacuation. Arm y forces m ay need the unique capabilities, equipm ent, and sk ills now typically seen in civilian urban search-and-rescue teams to clea r debris and search for casualties. Specially trained dogs may also play a vital role in locating victim s. Treatment 9-61. First aid training will have incre ased significance in UO. The com part- mented nature of UO, transportation restrictions, communications difficul- ties, and the finite number of combat medics m ay lim it the urban casualty’s initial treatm ent adm inistered by nonm edical personnel or to self-treatm ent measures. Units identify and train com bat lifesavers to perform in the absence of m edics. Since the likelihood of Arm y forces perform ing UO con- tinues to increase, commanders strive to m eet or exceed Arm y standards for the num ber of com bat lifesavers required for their specific unit. This increase in self, buddy, and combat lifesaver care , as well as longer delays in evacua- tion, m ay also increase requirem ents for additional first aid and medic- carried supplies. 9-62. In addition, the increased potent ial for delayed evacuation during UO mandates that Arm y com bat m edics be skilled in prolonged casualty care. (During the 3-4 October 1993 battle in Somalia, seven medics managed 39 casualties for more than 14 hours befo re they could be evacuated.) Evacua- tion delays significantly increase potent ial infection. Such delays m ay cause more casualties dying of their wounds; therefore, com bat m edics should also be skilled in adm inistering antibiotics on the battlefield. 9-63. All CHS personnel can recognize and treat injuries due to incendiary or fuel-air explosives (also known as th ermobaric weapons)—a favored, urban- oriented threat weapon (see Chapter 3). T hese weapons explode; create a cloud of volatile gases, liquids, or powders; and then ignite, creating an immense fireball consuming oxygen an d creating enormous overpressure. When em ployed in an urban structure, the blast wave or overpressure is greatly am plified. Inj uries resulting from these weapons are m assive burns, broken or crushed bones, concussions, m issile inj uries, and internal inj uries. Medics or doctors can easily overlook internal injuries (at least initially) unless they are trained, prepared, and expecting them . 9-64. The increased use of body arm or during UO will help prevent pene- trating chest and abdomen wounds. CHS pe rsonnel expect more groin, pelvis, and extrem ity inj uries. Furtherm ore, wh en fighting soldiers that are known to use body armor, a threat (particularl y snipers) can be expected to target the head and face more often than other anatom ic areas resulting in m ore head injuries. Lastly, hearing loss may increase particularly when firing recoilless weapons in enclosed spaces with little ventilation. 9-21"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ EXPLOSIVE ORDNANCE DISPOSAL SUPPORT 9-65. Explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) support provides the capability to neutralize domestic or foreign conventi onal, nuclear, chemical, and biological munitions and im provised devices. Such devices threaten m ilitary operations and m ilitary and civilian facilities, m ateriel, and personnel. Unexploded explosive ordnance (UXO) creates a m uch greater risk during UO than opera- tions in any other environm ent. Confined spaces, hard surfaces, and m ore personnel (both soldiers and civilians) in the vicinity may magnify the deto- nating effects of UXO. Dense terrain ma kes UXO more difficult to locate. In fact, terrorists select urban settings fo r their im provised explosive devices (IEDs) to potentially kill and destroy m ore, thus gaining greater visibility for their m essage. EOD units perform m any tasks (detecting, identifying, ren- dering safe from , and disposing of expl osives) associated with UXO and IEDs. Urban operations will rely m ore heavily on their role as advisors and instruc- tors on UXO hazards, protection m easures, and disposal techniques. EOD specialists will advise and train other Arm y forces, other services, multi- national partners, and civilian authorit ies. EOD specialists will often work closely with public affairs and psycholo gical operations personnel to increase awareness and teach the urban population to identify and avoid UXO. HUMAN RESOURCES SUPPORT 9-66. Human resources support (HRS) en compasses the following functions: manning the force, personnel support, an d personnel services. These activi- ties include personnel accounting; casu alty management; essential services; postal operations; and morale, welfare, and recreation provided to soldiers, their fam ilies, Departm ent of Arm y civilians, and contractors. 9-67. Successful UO require HRS functi ons. Clearly, HRS focuses on caring for the needs of people: soldiers and the civilians who support them . Since a critical com ponent of the urban environm ent is the population, these activi- ties, when required, may also support them . F or exam ple, personnel elem ents may support accountability of displaced persons and civilian inter- nees. In conjunction with mortuary a ffairs, casualty managers may assist with civilian death records and reports (always m aintaining sensitivity to the confidentiality of casualty inform atio n). A postal company may assist urban officials in training and reestablishing civilian postal operations. Personnel elem ents may also provide identification cards and docum ents to support increased populace and re sources control measures. 9-68. In offensive and defensive UO, HRS personnel will need to account for more casualties and more fre- quent reconstitution. In all UO, success relies on training individual replacements. Urban combat requires soldiers skilled in specific urban combat tactics, techniques, and procedures. They understand the soci etal aspects of the urban population and have training in crowd control to avoid escalating potentially explosive situations. T raining these replacem ents while in the replacem ent system frees urban commanders from having to do so. It also he lps reduce soldier Urban operations will continue to be manpower intensive, even as advances in technology make the conduct of urban battle more precise and discriminating.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS 9-69. Financial management operations make resources available when and where they are needed and assist the urban com mander in m aintaining fiscal responsibilities. Finance operations are necessary to conduct contracting and provide real-tim e inform ation, account ing, and services. Resource manage- ment operations ensure that urban operational policies and procedures adhere to laws and regulations, de velop command resource requirements, and leverage appropriate fund sources to m eet them . 9-70. UO will likely include other US m ilitary services, governm ental agencies, and contractors; m ultinational forces; NGOs; and various elem ents of the host nation. So m any actors complicate financial accounting, resource management, and cost capturing. Yet, these activities are vital to accom- plishing UO and m aintaining legal requirem ents. Arm y forces will receive support from and provide support to th ese participants. Resource managers provide crucial “in-theater” expertis e to the urban com mander on the obli- gation authority. T hey also furnish the docum entation necessary to obtain and pay for local goods and services using contract or commercial vendor services. However, commanders (with finance unit assistance) assess the econom ic im pact of UO on the econom y. Analysis includes how well the urban economics and commerce infrastructure can support the deployed force and how an influx of US currency m ay affect the overall econom y. 9-71. Finance units can also provide joint pay support and non-US pay support for host-nation em ployees and day laborers supporting UO, as well as for civilian internees. These units can support bounty program s and solatia (financial compensation). Commanders use bounty programs to purchase weapons, radios, inform ation, and other item s from the urban inhabitants. They also use cautio n when paying for critical human intelligence. First, they ensure that multiple collection agencies in the command avo id payi ng the same so urce for the same information and interpreting these repeated inputs as validation that inform ation is accurate and reliable. Second, they establish a pr ice or pay scale so subordinate units (particularly in multinational UO) equally com pensate their sources for inform ation. Com manders m ay also need to m ake solatia to alleviate grief, suffering, and anxiety resulting from in juries and property or personal loss resulting from som e aspect of UO. At othe r ti me s, co mmande rs make solatia to m eet cultural expectations of the urban population. These paym ents are nom inal in am ount and without an adm ission of liability by the Arm y. RELIGIOUS SUPPORT 9-72. Religious support entails provid ing and perform ing religious support operations for com manders to protect the free exercise of religion for soldiers, fam ily m embers, and authorized civilians . This includes personal delivery of rites, sacraments, ordinances, pastoral and spiritual care, and religious edu- cation. Such support also consists of advising the com mander on m atters of religion, morals, and morale as affected by religion; the im pact of local religions on the m ission; and the ethical im pact of com mand decisions. 9-23"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ Moral and Ethical Climate 9-73. Chaplains can help com manders sense the m oral and ethical clim ate in Arm y units and understand potential m oral dilem mas associated with planned UO. The urban environment affe cts soldiers’ mental health and can increase combat stress casualties, espe cially misconduct stress behaviors. Chaplains are an important part of combat stress support. The chaplain’s presence and faith sustains soldiers throughout periods of great trauma. Religious support contributes to the tota l well being of soldiers and aids in their return to combat readiness. Chap lains help bolster soldiers’ m oral and ethical behaviors through spiritual fitn ess training so that soldiers may better cope with ambiguous moral and et hical situations. Chaplains can help identify ethical concerns before they become critical co mmand pro blems. To this end, their observations help develop and modify ROE, which—due to am biguity or overly restraining rules—m ay be part of the problem . Influence of Local Religions 9-74. Chaplains advise com manders on m atters of religion as it affects the soldiers within their units. They also ex plain the influences of local religions on the urban populace and their pote ntial effects on Arm y forces and UO. Religion is a crucial aspect of assessing the societal com ponent of the urban environment. Understanding the major te nets and concepts of the religions and the im pact of faith on civilians’ lives m ay help com manders understand what motivates the populace. This und erstanding also helps commanders to appreciate the inhabitants’ attitudes toward other races, religions, and cul- tures and to identify unacceptable kinds of social interaction (particularly between soldiers and civilians). Failure to recognize and respect religious beliefs can rapidly erode the legitim acy of the m ission. A thorough analysis of the urban environm ent also includes the degree of influence religion and religious leaders have on the area’s governm ent, m ilitary, and econom y. LEGAL SUPPORT 9-75. Legal support provides operationa l law support in all legal disciplines (including m ilitary justice, internatio nal law, civil law—com prised of con- tract, fiscal, and environmental law, cl aims, and legal assistance). This sup- port assists in command and control, sustainment, and HRS of UO. Legal considerations are im portant in any op eration; they take on added signifi- cance during UO. They form the foundation for establishing ROE and are critical in the targeting process (determ ining protected targets, for exam ple). They affect how units acquire goods and services from urban areas and provide support to other agencies and organizations operating in an area. The environm ent’s com plex nature requires com manders and their staffs to review and closely consider applicable legal constraints when developing and executing courses of action. Most urban areas have a highly developed legal system. The SJA support to commanders address this urban system and its potential to affe ct, po sitive ly o r ne gative ly, UO. 9-76. International, host-nation, and US law and other regulatory guidelines may vary in their applicability by tim e and place; actions perm issible in one situation m ay be prohibited in anothe r.

FM 27-100 contains detailed legal guidelines affecting UO. International and Host-Nation Law 9-77. International law consists prim arily of agree- ments, treaties, and custo- mary law to include the law known as the law of war (see F M 27-10). T he law of war consists of four general principles applicable when conducting any operation but requiring particular attention during UO. Fig- ure 9-4 lists the four prin- ciples: m ilitary necessity, discrimination (or distinc- tion), unnecessary suffering (or humanity), and propor- tionality. 9-78. International law may affect urban opera- tional issues, such as the right of entry, base opera- tions, use of urban infrastructure, and overflight and landing rights. Status- of-forces agreem ents (SOFAs) exist or can be negot iated to resolve legal issues, such as the status of soldiers operating in foreign areas to include criminal and civil jurisdiction, taxation concerns, and claims for damages and inj uries. Unless a SOF A or other conven tion exists, soldiers operating in foreign urban areas have the same legal st atus as tourists; they are subject to the laws and j udicial process of the host nation. Com manders are responsible to understand the international and ho st-nation agreements and laws that influence foreign UO. If local law hind ers the operation, com manders may be able to inform the local US diplom atic mission and request that it negotiates a solution.

UO also comply with US law whet her it is in the form of a statute, executive order, regulation, or other directive from a federal branch or agency. US law influences UO by governing the acquisition of supplies and services for Army forces, regulating th e assistance that can be rendered to foreign nations, and controlling intellig ence activities. The Posse Com itatus Act, for example, makes it a crime for Army forces to enforce civil law. Simi- larly, portions of the Foreign Assistance Act prohibit soldiers from perform ing law enforcem ent activities in foreign urban areas. However, circumstances— expressly authorized by the Constituti on, acts of Congress, and other excep- tions to these statutes—exist that allow the Arm y to support civilian law 9-25"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ enforcement. Although not nearly all-in clusive, the above dem onstrates how US law further com plicates urban operations, particularly stability and sup- port, and increases the need for SJA advi ce and co unse l in all face ts o f UO. Legal Aspects of Nonlethal Force 9-80. Nonlethal capabilities can augm ent the m eans of deadly force and extend urban firepower options. They enhance the com mander’s ability to apply force in proportion to the threat and to allow discrim ination in its use. The range of nonlethal capabilities incl udes offensive inform ation operations, smoke and obscurants, irritants (such as chemical riot control agents), non- penetrating projectiles, and high-pressu re water devices. These continually expanding capabilities give com manders more options to confront situations that do not warrant deadly force but re quire soldiers to em ploy overwhelm ing decisive power. However, nonlethal capabilities are subject to the sam e legal constraints as lethal force (in fact, som e nonlethal capabilities can cause serious inj ury and death, particularly if not em ployed properly) and undergo the sam e legal review. Like lethal fo rce, nonlethal capabilities show m ilitary necessity, distinguish between combat ants and noncombatants, distinguish between military objectives and protecte d property, are used proportionally, and do not result in unnecessary suffering. Commanders cannot employ chemical herbicides or riot control agen ts without prior presidential approval. BAND SUPPORT 9-81. Bands provide music to instill in Arm y forces the will to fight and win. Bands also foster the support of m ultinational partners and urban popula- tions through support to ce rem onies, troop support functions, concerts, proto- col functions, and religious ceremonies . Army bands quickly and effectively com municate professionalism , a positive image, and a nonthreatening show of force. Throughout the spectrum of operations, planners consider band support when developing their informat ion operations concept of support to UO. Because UO are often resource intensive, band members may be required to assist in other essential ac tivities unrelated to m usic. Such tasks may include casualty evacuation; co mmand post security; and NBC recon- naissance and decontamination. GENERAL ENGINEER SUPPORT 9-82. General engineer support will be essential during UO. This support helps assess, construct, maintain, and restore essential LOCs and urban facilities to sustain Arm y forces, the urban population, or both. Using civilian resources and investing Arm y general engineer resources requires careful consideration by commanders and staff planners. Since all elem ents of the urban infrastructure interconnect, gene ral engineering support touches each category to som e degree. Figure 9-5 illustrates how urban-specific, general engineering tasks align primarily with the transportation and distribution, energy, and adm inistration and hum an services com ponents of the urban infrastructure.

During urban offensive and defensive operations, Arm y engineer units accom - plish tasks to sustain or im prove m obility, surviva- bility, and sustainability of US and allied forces. These units maximize the existing urban facilities, host-nation support, civilian contractors, and j oint engineer assets. Commanders consider how using urban facilities to sup- port m ilitary forces may negatively affect the popula- tion. On the other hand, con- struction and repair may benefit both Army units and the urban inhabitants. Re- storing the urban transportation netw ork not only im proves m ilitary LOCs, but may also allow needed commerce to resum e. Repairing urban airfields or ports increases throughput capabilities for m ilitary supplies, facilitates m edi- cal evacuation operations to the support base, accelerates needed relief efforts, and allows international co mme rce to pro ceed. C ommande rs may f irst invest resources and conduct general engi neering tasks to restore facilities for civilian use. Such actions stem future drains on operational resources or to facilitate later transition of control bac k to civilian authorities. For exam ple, repairing police stations, detention facilities, and marksm anship ranges may help urban governments reestablish la w and order after completing urban offensive or defensive operations. Duri ng most support operations and some stability operations, the focus of general engineering clearly supports and assists the urban population rath er than sustains Army forces. Figure 9-5.

Fire protection and prevention, as well as fire fighting, takes on added significance during UO, particularly offensive and defensive operations. Most ordnance affects by heat and flame. Th is, coupled with an abundance of com- bustible m aterial (buildings, furniture, gasoline, oil, and propane), poses a serious risk to soldiers, civilians, and the urban operation. Large shantytowns can exacerbate this problem . In highly com bustible areas, com manders m ay even need to lim it or preclude the use of sm all-arm s tracer am munition. 9-85. When analyzing the administrati on and hum an services com ponent of the infrastructure, com manders determ ine the adequacy of existing civilian fire fighting support. A deteriorated or nonexistent infrastructure that cannot support the urban area will likely fail to handle the increased risk due to m ilitary operations. Com manders m ay need to provide fire fighting team s to support their own forces and civilians. 9-27"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ 9-86. A m ilitary force task organized with multiple fire fighting team s (even with maxim um use of available civilian fire-fighting assets) will only be able to fight some fires in the AO. Water distribution systems damaged during operations, chem ical and other TIM, an d hostile activities will further com - plicate and lim it fire fighting capabilit ies. Com manders develop priorities for equipm ent, facility, and infrastructure protection. All soldiers need training in fire prevention and initial or im mediate response fire fighting. Such training includes planning covered and concealed movement, withdrawal, and evacuation routes. Soldiers are trai ned to identify and remove ignition and fuel sources and be provided additi onal fire fighting material such as extinguishers, sand, and blankets (see FM 5-415). WASTE MANAGEMENT 9-87. Management of all forms of wa ste, particularly human, putrescible (such as food), and medical, may become a critical planning consideration for Arm y forces. This particularly applies if the urban waste m anagem ent infra- structure was previously inadequate or damaged during UO, the Army force is operating in the urban area for an extended period of tim e, and a signi- ficant number of the urban population rem ains. Failure to adequately con- sider this aspect, possibly coupled wi th an inadequate water supply, may create unacceptable sanitary and hygiene conditions and subsequently increase DNBIs as well as civilian casualties. CIVIL-MILITARY OPERATIONS 9-88. Com manders use civil-m ilitary oper ations (CMO) to establish, m ain- tain, influence, or exploit relations to achieve operational obj ectives. These relations are am ong military forces, civilian authorities and organizations (both governm ental and nongovernm ental), and the civilian population. Because of the urban society’s link to other aspects of the urban environm ent, CMO will prevail in all UO. Com manders may need to assum e tem porary responsibility for functions and capaciti es of the urban governm ent. Although unstated, civil-m ilitary cooperation, pa rticularly during urban stability opera- tions and support operations, will be an essential, im plied task of the mission. Like public affairs, effectiv e CMO is based on establishing and maintaining credibility and trust with the urban populace and civilian organizations operating in the urban environm ent. CIVIL AFFAIRS 9-89. CA units will be critical during UO. While any m ilitary force can con- duct CMO, CA units are specifically or ganized, trained, and equipped to con- duct activities in support of CMO. Th ey have experience in planning and conducting CMO, a regional focus (whi ch includes enhanced cultural aware- ness and language training), and ci vilian technical expertise. Such experience ensures relevant support to commanders conducting urban operations. CA units organize their cap abilities into 16 functional skills nor- mally arranged in four specialty function team s (see Figure 9-6). Com - manders use these skills, often unfam iliar to m ost m ilitary personnel, to— • Develop their situational understanding of the urban environm ent (particularly the infrastructure and society). 9-28"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":" Urba n Comba t Se rvice Support • Plan CMO to support UO. • Public Ad mi nistration • Pu blic Educat ion • Pu blic Safet y • Internationa l Law • Pu blic Healt h • Public Tr ansportation • Public W orks and Utilitie s • Public C ommunicat ions • Fo od and A griculture • Economic Devel opment • Civili an Supp ly • Em ergen cy Servi ces • Environm en tal Ma nage me nt • Cultural Re lations • Civil Inf ormatio n • Dislocated C ivilians Gov ernmen t Pu blic Facilities Ec onom ics an d C ommerce Spe cial Fu nc tions • Achieve many of the fundam entals of UO shown in Chapter 5. Figure 9-6. Civ il Affairs Functional Skills 9-90. In addition to pro- viding essential inform ation for assessing the urban environm ent, CA personnel and activities help shape the battlefield, dominate a civil problem , and tran- sition to a legitimate civil authority. Specifically, CA units and CMO help urban commanders— • Minim ize civilian interference with UO and the im pact of urban opera- tions on the populace and infrastructure. CA personnel can help estab- lish and run a civil-m ilitary operations center to coordinate UO with civilian agencies (both governm ental and nongovernm ental), other ser- vices, and m ultinational partners. • Provide advice and assistance to restore or rehabilitate portions of the infrastructure, particularly life-sust aining portions of the administra- tion and hum an services com ponent of the infrastructure. • Plan, supervise, and execute necessa ry populace and resources control measures (in close coordination with m ilitary police units) until no longer required or the urban operation is com pleted. • When requested or when m ilitary necessity or legitim ate directives require, establish all or portions of the civil adm inistration. • Determine available supplies and services in the urban area and if necessary assist in negotiating thei r acquisition. They also help com - manders assess the capability, dependability, and willingness of urban sources to provide and sustain identified needs as well as to calculate the im pact of using them on other aspects of the urban environm ent. • In conjunction with the SJA, fulfill the Arm y’s responsibilities toward the urban population under international, host-nation, and US law. • Plan and conduct the transition of control for the urban area or opera- tion to another m ilitary or civilian governm ental or nongovernm ental organization or agency. 9-91. Sim ilar to public affairs operations, CMO are related to inform ation operations (see Chapter 4). The nature of CMO and the need for CA person- nel to develop and m aintain close relationships with the urban population put CA personnel in a favorable position to collect inform ation. CA personnel work daily with civilians, their equipm ent, and their records that m ay be prim e sources of inform ation. If used correctly, CA personnel can complement the intelligence collection process, es pecially hum an intelligence, necessary to understand the dynam ic societal com ponent of the urban environm ent and detect significant changes. Howeve r, CA personnel are not, and cannot appear as, intelligence agents; otherwis e, it will underm ine their ability to 9-29"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"FM 3-06 __________________________________________________________________________________ interact with the civilian com munity. Ex am ples of inform ation available to CA units include government documents, libraries, and archives; files of newspapers and periodicals; industrial and commercial reco rds; and technical equipment, blueprints, and plans. ASSESSMENT OF CIVIL CONSIDERATIONS 9-92. As part of the initial planning process, CA units conduct an area assessm ent, which can provide com mander s with essential inform ation about the environm ent. Com manders integrat e this initial assessm ent into the overall urban IPB process (see Appendix C, FM 41-10). To help analyze civil considerations, commanders and staffs can consider many characteristics such as physical terrain, structures, capabilities, organizations, people, and events. T hese characteristics easily align with terrain, society, and infrastructure; and, like them, they are overlapped and interdependent (see Figure 9-7 and FM 6-0). 9-93. Overall, CA personnel help co mmanders understand the com plexities of the infrastructure and societal com ponents of the urban area. T hese com ponents (together with the terrain or physical com ponent of the urban area) interconnect. CA forces help identify and understand the relationships and interactions between these urban com ponents. From this understanding, com manders can anticipate how specific m ilitary actions affect the urban environm ent and the subsequent reacti ons. CA personnel consider the short- term effects and reactions as well as the long-term consequences. Under- standing these long-term consequences helps ensure a sm ooth transition of the urban area back to civilian control. 9-30"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"Appendix A Siege of Beirut: An Illustration of the Fundamentals of Urban Operations The IDF had neither the strate gy nor the e xper ience n or the configuration of forces to fight and sus tain a h ouse -to-house cam paign in Be irut.
