Commanders, trainers, and soldiers will use this manual and STP 21 - 1 - SMCT, Soldier's Manual of Common Tasks, Skill Level 1 , to plan, conduct, sustain, and evaluate individual training of common tasks in units. This manual contains a common task training plan for skill levels (SL) 1 through 4 and task summaries for SL 2 through SL 4 critical common tasks that support unit wartime missions. This manual is the only authorized source for these common tasks. Task summaries in this manual supersede any common tasks appearing in MOS - specific soldier's manuals. Training support information, such as reference materials, is also included. Trainers and first - line supervisors should ensure SL 2 through SL 4 s oldiers have access to this publication in their work areas, unit learning centers, and unit libraries. This manual applies to both active and Reserve Component soldiers. Unless this manual states otherwise, masculine pronouns do not refer excl u sively t o men. The proponent of this publication is the Commander, United States Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) , with the Commander, United States Army Training Support Center (ATSC) designated as the principle pu b lishing, printing and distribution ag ency . Proponents for the specific tasks are the Army schools and agencies as identified by the school code, listed at appendix A, consisting of the first three digits of the task identification nu m ber. All comments, suggestions and reco mmended changes to this public a tion should be submitted as follows: Record any comments or questions regarding the task summaries contained in this manual on a DA Form 2028 ( Recommended Changes to Publications and Blank Forms ) and send it to the respectiv e task proponent with inform a tion copies forwarded to: Commander, U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, ATTN: ATTG - I, Fort Monroe, VA 23651 - 5000, and Commander, U.S. Army Training Support Center, ATTN: ATIC - ITSC - CM, Fort Eustis, VA 23604 - 5166. REPRODUCI BLE FORMS Following the very favorable acceptance of previous skill level 1 SMCTs \"pocket - size\" format, the August 200 3 revisions ( STP 21 - 1 - SMCT and STP 21 - 24 - SMCT ) are printed in 5 - by - 7 - inch format .

Where online access is not available, the soldier's unit must obtain hard copies of these forms SPECIAL NOTE FROM THE STAFF CONCERNING THE REVISED SMCT Experienced trainers will notice that, in addition to numerous new tasks in the revised SMCT, there are many tasks for which the skill level has been lowered from that in the past. This reflects results from the recent survey of approximately 19,000 enlisted soldiers, their commanders, and senior leaders, to determine who was actually performing certain tasks , and the am ount of learning that was actually filtering down in the “one room schoolhouse” of the working Army. When it was established that a significant percentage of soldiers were performing those tasks at skill levels that were above their own, it was decided to lower the task designation, giving trainers — and the Army — the full advantage of accelerated learning at every level. This SMCT, if anything, reflects back to its users a faithfulness to this spirit of Army training from wh om it derived, an allegia nce and gratitude to the profession and legacy of every United States Army soldier. Thank you. United States Army Training and Doctrine Command United States Army Training Support Center"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 1 - 1 Chapter 1 Introduction 1 - 1. GENERAL INTRODUCT ION This manual contains the critical common tasks for skill levels 2, 3, and 4. Mastering the performance of these tasks will help the individual soldier fight better and survive on the battlefield, and perform across the full spectrum of operations. Eac h soldier must be able to perform all critical common tasks for his or her own skill level and below. The individual soldier shares responsibi l ity with the trainer to sustain the skills and knowledge required to perform all critical common tasks. a. Individua l Soldiers. To ensure you can perform each task, have a n other soldier or your supervisor periodically evaluate your performance using the task summaries. If you have questions about how to perform a task or which task to perform, ask your first - line superv isor. The first - line supervisor knows how to perform each task and can direct you to the appropriate training materials. You should also check the Reimer Digital Library for new training materials. It is your responsibility to use these materials to mainta in your pr o ficiency. b. Trainers . If you are a supervisor and trainer and have soldiers wor k ing for you, you must train them to do the tasks for their skill level and below. Commanders and trainers should use the Soldier’s Manual of Common Tasks ( SMCT ) , milit ary occupational sp e cialty (MOS) specific soldier’s training publications (STPs), and mission training plans (MTPs) to establish effective training plans and programs which integrate individual and collective tasks. 1 - 2. SMCT AND SUPPORT OF BATTLE - FOCUSED TRAIN ING a. Overview. The SMCT s document the common tasks by skill level on which all soldiers must be trained and eval u ated. These documents assist leaders in identifying the strengths and wea k nesses of the soldiers in their unit and pro vide a means for evaluating the effectiveness of the unit s individual training program. Evaluation results also tell leaders where to concentrate training to improve unit readiness and help soldiers develop professionally. b. Leader's Assessment. The leader ’s assessment focuses on specific unit mission requirements. It gives commanders a way to evaluate soldier performance on individual tasks that directly support their unit mission. These tasks may be common tasks as well as MOS - specific tasks. Leader’s a s sessments should be conducted year round. Unit commanders should make leader’s comments an integral part of their unit training so hands - on evalu a tion is systematically performed at the unit level."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 1 - 2 (1) Tasks selected for leader’s asses sments include, but are not li m ited to, individual tasks that — (a) Support the unit s mission essential task list (METL). (b) Support other non - METL unit tasks as shown in the MTP. (c) Are identified by higher headquarters for inclusion in planned individual trainin g. (d) Were rated as substandard on previous training feedback , such as the common task test (CTT) or annual general inspections. (e) Are relevant to the soldier’s MOS but not required in his cu r rent duty assignment. (2) Leaders may conduct their assessment — (a) Before, during, or after individual skills training. (b) As part of MTP training. (c) On the job. (d) At specially prepared test sites or in a battlefield scenario. (e) During training or job breaks. (f) After hours in the barracks. (g) During special squad or individual competitive even ts. (3) The leader’s assessment evaluates the combat effectiveness of soldiers and the unit. Commanders can use this evaluation to correct training deficiencies and plan unit training. Commanders can also use the results for personnel actions (such as preparin g enlisted evaluation reports, making re c ommendations for promotions , and other personnel management decisions). c. Common Task Test (CTT). The CTT is a hands - on test to evaluate proficiency on critical combat and survival tasks. A new CTT is fielded each ye ar, based on STP 21 - 1 - SMCT and STP 21 - 24 - SMCT. Refer to AR 350 - 1 for details on test administration and scoring. Units may administer the CTT any time during the test period. CTT evaluations should be integrated with training exercises to conserve resourc es and improve realism. For example, units could test soldiers on CTT tasks during — • MTP evaluations and other collective training activities. • Weapons qualification. • Gas chamber training. • Stations in a soldier battlefield course or military stakes co m petit ion. The CTT is a routine part of the training schedule ; it is a m a jor event on the unit calendar. Like the leader’s assessment, CTT results are objective measures for the commander to use to evaluate unit readiness and the"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 1 - 3 effectiveness of the train ing program. Leaders also consider CTT results when preparing enlisted evaluation reports and recommending so l diers for promotion. 1 - 3. SMCT FEATURES a. Common Task Training Plan . The common task training plan ( chapter 2) lists, by skill level, the critica l common tasks for which all soldiers are responsible. It indicates where each task is first taught to standard and how often training on the task is required to sustain proficiency. Leaders should use this information to develop a comprehensive unit tra ining plan. b. Task Summary. Each task summary documents the performance r e quirements of a critical common task. The summaries provide the soldier and the trainer with the information necessary to evaluate the critical tasks. The task summa ries use the following format : • Task Title. The task title identifies the action to be performed. • Task Number. A ten - digit number identifies each task. The first three digits of the number represent the proponent code for that task. (A list o f the proponent codes is given in appendix A.) Include the entire ten - digit task number, along with the task title, in any correspondence relating to the task. • Conditions. The task conditions identify all the equipment, tools, materials, refe rences, job aids, and supporting personnel the soldier needs to perform the task. This section identifies environmental conditions that can alter task performance ( such as visibility, temperature, or wind ) . This section also identifies specif ic cues or events (such as a chemical attack or identification of an unexploded ordnance hazard) that trigger task perfor m ance. • Standard. A task standard specifies the requirements for task performance by indicating how well, completely, or accurately a product must be produced, a process must be performed, or both. Standards are described in terms of accuracy, tolerances, completeness, format, clarity, number of errors, quantity, sequence, or speed of performance. • Training and Evaluation Guide. This section has two parts. The first part, Performance Steps, lists the individual steps the soldier must complete to perform the task. The second part is the Performance Evaluation Guide. This provides guidance on how to evaluate a soldier’s pe r formance of th e task. It is composed of three subsections. The Evaluation Preparation subsection identifies special setup procedures and, if required, instructions for evaluating the task performance. Sometimes the conditions and standard must be modified so the ta sk can be evaluated in a situation that does not exactly duplicate actual field performance. This subsection may also include instructions the evaluator should give to the soldier before the performance test. The Performance Measures subsection identifies the"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" 1 - 4 criteria for acceptable task performance. The soldier is rated (GO/ NO GO ) on each specific action or specific product produced . As indicated in the Evalu a tion Guidance subsection, the soldier must score a GO o n all ( or each spec i fied ) performance measure to receive a GO on the task. • References. This section identifies references that provide more detailed and thorough explanations of task performance requirements than that given in the task summary descripti on. This section identifies r e sources the soldier can use to improve or maintain performance. Additionally, task summaries can include safety statements, env i ronmental considerations, and notes. Safety statements (danger, warning, caution) alert users to the possibility of immediate death, personal injury, or damage to equipment. Notes provide additional information to support task performance. c. Training Support . This manual includes the following that provide additional training support information. • Append ix A ( Proponent School and Agency Codes ) — lists the task proponents and agency codes (first three digits of the task number) with a d dresses for submitting comments concerning specific tasks in this manual. • Appendix B ( Guide to Forms ) — explain s the use of various SMCT training and evaluation forms and, in the online version , prov ides links to the forms. • Glossary — lists abbreviations and acronyms and their definitions. • References — li sts all reference materials cited in the task summ a ries by type, identification number, title, and date. 1 - 4. CONDUCTING COMMON TA SK TRAINING AND EVAL UATION a. Role of the Commander. As a commander, you must ensure that your training plan prepares the unit for th e full spectrum of operations. The plan should enable your soldiers to develop and sustain proficiency on the MOS - specific and common tasks for their skill level. Use critical common task summaries to evaluate your soldiers' proficiency on those tasks cri tical to your unit mission. An effective training program converts unproductive time into effective training time. This will upgrade the skills of individual soldiers and promote the development of junior leaders. To develop an effective unit training p rogram we reiterate, from the STP 21 - 1 - SMCT, the following seven - step approach — Step 1. Set the objectives for training. Step 2. Plan the resources (personnel, time, funds, facilities, devices, training aids). Step 3. Train the trainers. Step 4 . Provi de the resources."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" 1 - 5 Step 5. Manage risks, environmental and safety considerations. Step 6. Conduct the training. Step 7. Evaluate the results. b. Role of the Trainer. Although training is everyone’s business, you, the NCO, are the key to training the indivi dual soldiers assigned to your unit. You should be the first to recognize which tasks each soldier can or cannot perform. You must ensure each soldier takes steps to master these tasks. This manual will assist you, the trainer, in doing what trainers do be st — train. To train effectively, you must perform the following functions. (1) Plan the training. You can usually integrate or conduct training for specific common tasks concurrently with other training or during slack p e riods. Use the Common Task Training Pl an in chapter 2 to identify the critical common tasks for which each soldier is responsible. (2) Prepare yourself. Get training guidance from your chain of co m mand on when to train, what to train, and what resources are available. Know the training obj ectives for each task and ensure you can perform the task. Gather the necessary training references for each task , as listed in the task summary. (3) Obtain the resources. Gather the required resources and pr e pare the training site according to the conditions statement and the evaluation preparation section of the task summary. Ensure equipment needed to co m plete the task is operational. Coordinate the use of training aids and devices. (4) Train the soldiers. Show the soldiers how to do the task to sta n dard and explain each step. Give each soldier at least one chance to perform the task. (5) Evaluate the soldiers. Evaluate how well the soldiers perform. You may conduct the evaluation during individual training or while evaluating individual performance during the conduct of unit collective tasks. Use the Common Task Training Plan to determine how often to check soldiers to e n sure they maintain proficiency. (6) Record the results. Record the GO/ NO GO results in the leader book. You may use DA Form 5165 - R; see the Guide to Forms ( appendix B) at the end of this publication. Do not make written entries directly on the evaluation guides in the SMCT. (7) Retrain and reevaluate. Work with soldiers until they can pe r form the task to specific soldier’s manual standa rd. Good training increases the professionalism of each soldier and helps to develop an efficient unit. You are a vital link in the conduct of good training."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 2 - 1 Chapter 2 Training Guide 2 - 1. COMMON TASK TRAINING PLAN The Common Task Training Plan provides information to help the trainer plan, prepare, train, evaluate, and monitor individual training in units. It lists , by general subject area and skill level , the critical common tasks soldiers must perform, the initial training loca tion, and a suggested frequency of training. The training location column uses brevity codes to indicate where the task is first taught to standards. If the task is taught in the unit the word “UNIT” a p pears in this column. “SD” indicates tasks trained via self - development m e dia. If it is taught in the training base, the brevity code ( BCT, OSUT, AIT) of the resident course appears. Brevity codes and resident courses are listed below . ANCOC Advanced NCO Course BNCOC Basic NCO Course PLDC Prima ry Leadership Development Course BCT Basic Combat Training OSUT One Station Unit Training AIT Advanced Individual Training UNIT Trained in/by the Unit SD Self - Development Training The sustainment training column lists how often (frequency) soldiers should train on the task to ensure they maintain their proficiency. This information is not a requirement, but rather a guide the commander can use to develop a comprehensive unit training plan. The commander, with the unit trainers, is in the best position to determine on which tasks and how often soldiers need training to maintain unit readiness.

Members of the Armed Forces have a duty to support U.S. interest and oppose U.S. enemies regardless of the circumstances.

The GPW requires that medical personnel and chaplains be allowed to perform their professional duties while captured. However, the captors control the degree to which these duties can be performed. But, even while performing li mited professional duties, medical personnel and chaplains are held accountable for all their actions.

This should be sent before the first correction, or with the first correction. 3. Adjust rounds to within 50 meters of the target, within 45 seconds of the impact of each adjusting round. a. Spot each round when it impacts as right o r left, over or short of your target. b. Determine corrections for deviation left or right of the target. N ote. Measure deviation . Measure the horizontal angle in mils, using the reticle pattern in the binoculars or hand measurement of angular devi ation. Estimate the range to the target and divide by 1,000. This is the o bserver - t arget ( OT ) factor. If the OT distance is 1,000 meters or greater, the OT factor is expressed to the nearest whole number. If t he OT distance is less than 1,000 meters, the OT factor is expressed to the nearest 1/10th. For example, 800 = 0.8. Multiplying the OT factor by the deviation measured in mils produces deviation corrections in meters. c. When the first range spotting is o bserved, make a range correction that would result in a range spotting in the opposite direction. For example, if the first round is short, add enough to get an over on the next round. This is called successive bracketing ( f igure 061 - 283 - 6003 - 2 ). Figure 061 - 2 83 - 6003 - 3 shows the impact of the initial round. The target is 2100 meters away. Since the round is beyond the target, you must drop. You est i mate that the round is 2 50 meters beyond the target. Therefore, you must drop 400 meters to start successive bracketing procedures. The round i m pacted 50 mils left of the target. With an OT factor of 2, the round impacted 100 meters left. Your correction to the FDC is \"RIGHT 100 — DROP 400 — OVER .”"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":" Skill Level 2 061 - 283 - 6003 3 - 73 S kill L evel 2 Performance Steps WARNING DO NOT BRACKET when DANGER CLOSE, it could result in friendly casualties, use the creeping fire procedure (all corrections are 100 meters or less).

Continued work as rapidly as possible. 6. Maintained camouflage and concealment (to include noise, light, and litter discipline). 7. Constructed positions properly. Performance Steps 1. Designate p rimary positions. a. Ensur e each position ha s cover, concealment, and good fields of fire. Position weapons so their fires overlap, m u tually support one another, and can be integrated, so you can place heavy surprise fire on the enemy. Watch closely any routes that could pr o vide the attacker cover and positions from which he can mass his fire on your position. Be sure your entire squad sector is covered so you can repel any assault. b. Consider the number of men available, then position each one so he can support the men on his right and left. When the platoon's key weapons have been positioned, the men in the squad are positioned to protect those weapons from a dismounted a s sault. Each sector of fire must cross in front of another position at a point beyond hand grenade range. Site each fighting position using natural cover and concealment; then — (1) Clear fields of fire to allow each man to do the job for which he is positioned. DO NOT OVER CLEAR. (2) Build artificial cover, such as a parapet, if required. (3) Hide everythin g. c. Ensure that all enemy approaches into your squad sector are ad e quately covered by automatic weapons fire. d. Before digging in, move to the front of the position to e n sure that each fighting position has frontal cover from enemy fire and all positi ons are mutually supporting. Note . A good fighting position should allow you to see and fire to the front when not receiving effective direct fire; however, if effective direct fire is received, the soldier can move behind frontal cover and fire to the o blique. e. To position each weapon of a rifle squad, follow the procedures b e low."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":" 3 - 120 071 - 430 - 0002 Skill Level 2 S kill L evel 2 Performance Steps (1) Automatic riflemen. Identify dismounted avenues of approach, such as ravines, draws, and heavily wooded or brushy areas that are not covered with the machine gun. In ar eas covered by the machine gun, find out what dead space the machine gun has and cover it with automatic rifle fire, if possible. If there is no dead space, assign a sector that will interlock with and overlap the machine gun's sector and final protective fire. (2) Grenadiers. Position grenade launchers to cover the dead space of the automatic weapon final protective fire. They must also be positioned to cover the entire squad sector. (3) Riflemen. Position riflemen between the remaining positions to give continuous observation and fire throughout the squad sector. They provide mutual support between positions and identify targets for the squad and platoon key weapons (grenade launcher, squad automatic weapons, machine gun, and Dragons). (4) Claym ore mines. Use these to cover any dead space that ca n not be covered with 40 - mm grenade launchers, and to supplement the fire of your riflemen. f. S elect a position from which you can control the fire of your squad. Use your weapon on ly when necessary to protect yourself, to direct fire, or to influence the action at a critical point. P osition yourself slightly behind the squad so you can observe and contact your squad, or at least your team leaders. If your sq uad strength is reduced, or the terrain does not permit you to e s tablish a position to the rear, man a forward position. In this case, you may have to construct a single position to be able to observe your squad sector. You must be able to maintain conta ct with your platoon and fire team leaders from whatever position you select. Look for covered routes that you can use to move to the positions of your team leaders and platoon leader. 2. Designate a lternate positions. a. Prepare alternate positions so they are ready for occup a tion by the squad when the primary positions are no longer defendable. The location s of alternate positions are highly dependent upon the terrain, cover and concealment, and existing enemy situation. They must be near enough to the primary positions so the squad can cover the same se c tors of fire as from the primary positions, without sustaining excessive casualties. A soldier's alternate position may be to the flank or slightly to the rear of his primary position. b. When sele cting alternate positions, consider the following points: (1) Do they allow the weapon(s) or element(s) to accomplish the same mission as from the primary positions?"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":" Skill Level 2 071 - 430 - 0002 3 - 121 S kill L evel 2 Performance Steps (2) Do they provide — (a) Observation of the primary sector of fire? (b) Cover and conc ealment? (c) Maximum use of natural and artificial obstacles? (d) Control of the key terrain in the squad sector? (e) Cover of the avenues of approach into the sector? (f) Cover and concealment of withdrawal? c. Pick squad alternate positions based on the alternate pos i tions of key weapons (M60 machine gun, M249 machine gun, and Dragon). d. Depending on their priority, prepare alternate positions immediately after the completion of the primary positions. Construct commun i cation trenches between prim ary and alternate pos i tions as time and terrain permit. When supervising the preparation of alte r nate positions, ensure that they are sited and constructed to take max i mum advantage of the natural defensive characteristics of the terrain and the capabiliti es of organic weapons. 3. Designate s upplementary positions. a. Orient supplementary positions, unlike alternate positions, in a different direction than the primary position normally, within 200 meters of the primary positions. As time and terrain perm it, prepare communication trenches to provide covered routes between primary and supplementary positions. b. When selecting supplementary positions, consider the following: (1) Do they allow the squad to defend as part of the platoon against enemy attack from the flank(s) and rear? (2) Do they cover the most dangerous avenues of approach, other than those into the primary positions? (3) Do they meet the same guidelines that apply to placement and construction of primary and alternate positions?

If the near edge of the area is clear, the over watching elements move forward quickly and the advance continues. 4. Reconnaissance by fire. a. Reconnaissance by fire is accomplished by firing on likely or su s pected enemy positions in an attempt to remove camouflage and to cause the enemy to disclose his presence by movement or return fire. Du ring reconnaissance by fire, positions being reconnoitered must be observed continuously so enemy activity can be quickly and definitely located. b. Reconnaissance by fire may be employed by route reconnai s sance teams as a security measure when time is cr itical and the loss of surprise is not essential. c. If the enemy returns the fire, the situation is further developed. If the fire is not returned, reconnaissance continues.

Entered and left the target area without being detected by the enemy. Performance Steps 1. E stimate the situation. When the reconnaiss ance mission is r e ceived, develop an estimate of the situation. Base the estimate on current intelligence about the enemy in the vicinity of the target area, and on the capabilities of the unit. While planning for the mission, have the unit pr e pare for t he mission also. Tailor the organization to best support the mi s sion. The reconnaissance element of a platoon will normally be no larger than a squad. 2. Plan details. Develop the overall plan with a consideration of the following factors: a. Use Inte lligence. All reconnaissance operations must be based on the best information available as to actual conditions in the objective area. b. Use deceptive measures. The success of reconnaissance operations is determined, to a large extent, on decept ion measures and on und e tected infiltration and exfiltration. c. Use the smallest unit possible to accomplish the mission. This decreases the possibility of enemy detection. Though only a small element reconnoiters, the parent unit must be large eno ugh to provide security or support if the reconnaissance is detected or an enemy force engages the element . d. Remain undetected. The unit uses stealth, camouflage, co n cealment, and sound and light discipline. The se techniques allow the unit to take advantage of periods of limited visibility to avoid contact and to get near , or on , the objective. e. Use surveillance, target acquisition, and night observation (STANO) devices. The unit makes use of STANO devices to help it move and gain information about the enemy. Based on intelligence reports, co n sideration must be given to the enemy's detection devices. When the e n emy may have detection devices, passive devices should be used to d e crease the probability of enem y detection. f. Rehearse. After intelligence has been analyzed, the plan deve l oped, special items of equipment procured and issued, and the troops briefed, the unit rehearses the plan. This rehearsal is a key factor that e n hances the probability of the success of the operation. Rehearsals are as detailed as time allow s and include dry runs and briefings with repetition and questioning as needed to ensure understanding of the plan. Conti n gency plans are also rehearsed . To ensure that the contingency plans are understood , the reconnaissance members must repeat the m ."},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":" 3 - 266 071 - 720 - 0015 Skill Level 3 S kill L evel 3 Performance Steps g. Minimize audio and electronic communications. Co nstraints on communication depend on enemy detection abilities and on how time sensitive the information obtained from the enemy is. There may be i n stances where the importance of the information require s an immediate report. The unit's existence could be threatened. Often, a one - time radio contact during the mission is necessary. h. Inspect. The planning phase of the operation include s at least one inspection of all members of the reconnaissance force, to include their equipment. Only es sential equipment, identified by the platoon leader as equipment required for mission accomplishment, is carried. Special equipment must be closely inspected and safeguarded to ensure it function s during the mission. Extra personnel and equipment a s signed to the unit must also be carefully inspected and monitored prior to and during the operation. Any shortcomings found in personnel or equi p ment are corrected before the operation begins. Thorough inspections and supervision of personne l and equipment before the operation reduce the probabilities of compromise or failure. 3 . Assign subordinate missions. Regardless of the types of reconnaissance, units are normally assigned one of the three subordinate missions: Co m mand and control, reconnaissance of the objective, or security of the force. a. Command and control. The commander of the unit conducting a reconnaissance normally require s a small command group to assist in communicating with higher headquarters, subor dinate elements, and su p porting forces, and to coordinate and control supporting elements, fire su p port, and air or water transport for the operation. For small operations, this group may consist of only the commander and a radio operator. For larger ope rations, the commander may require intelligence, logistics, and fire support elements, with adequate communication personnel for sustained 24 - hour operations. The command group is always kept as small as po s sible."},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":" Skill Level 3 071 - 720 - 0015 3 - 267 S kill L evel 3 Performance Steps b. Reconnaissance of the objective. The element with the reconnai s sance mission approaches the target using stealth and concealment. All plans and applicable contingencies are conducted with the major effort made toward obtaining the information required while remaining und e tected. The r econnaissance element must skillfully avoid all known and discovered enemy sensing devices; therefore, patience is important. Pa s sive STANO devices will be used to observe activities at the objective. Information received about the target may be transmit ted back to the a p propriate headquarters by electronic means as it is observed. Or, the r e connaissance personnel may withdraw from the target and disseminate information by other means. The reconnaissance site should be sterilized before withdrawal. Wit hdrawal from the area must be as skillful, patient, and precise as was the movement into it. c. Security of the force. The reconnaissance element(s) with this mi s sion must provide the commander sufficient warning of the location and movement of enem y forces to permit the parent force to take evasive a c tion or, when this is not possible, to provide covering fires that permit wit h drawal of the reconnaissance element. Only if warnings are timely and information is accurate does the commander have the t ime and space to react. It is also the only way that, if the reconnaissance element is d e tected, the commander can arrange to give it sufficient over watching su p pressive fires or time to evade and withdraw safely. 4 . C onduct an area reconnaissance and obtain information about a specific location and the area immediately around it (for example, road junctions, hills, bridges, enemy positions). Designate t he location of the objective by either grid coordin ates or a map overlay with a boundary line drawn around the area. a. Once given an area reconnaissance mission, the platoon moves to the appointed area in the shortest possible time. This normally involves traveling along existing roads an d, of course, using the appropriate mov e ment techniques. During this movement to an area, the platoon reports and bypasses enemy opposition unless ordered to do otherwise. b. When the platoon reaches its area, it halts and sets up an objective rallying p oint (ORP). Once the ORP has been set up, the objective can be reconnoitered in one of two ways :"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":" 3 - 268 071 - 720 - 0015 Skill Level 3 S kill L evel 3 Performance Steps (1) When the terrain permits the security element to move to a pos i tion to over watch the reconnaissance element, the leader may decide to have sma ll reconnaissance teams move to each surveillance point or va n tage point around the objective instead of having the entire element move as a unit from point to point. After the objective has been reconnoitered, the elements return to the ORP and informati on is issued. The patrol then returns to friendly lines. (2) When the terrain does not allow the platoon to secure the obje c tive area, the platoon leaves a security element at the ORP and uses r e connaissance and security (R&S) teams to reconnoiter the ob jective.

(1) EW is the means through which commanders protect their own electronic systems while attacking those of the en emy. (2) EW exploits, disrupts, and deceives enemy command and co n trol while protecting friendly use of communications and non - communications systems. (3) On the battlefield , EW is divided into two categories: offensive and defensive. b. Define elec tronic attack (EA). (1) Offensive EW is referred to as EA. (2) EA is the transmission of electronic jamming signals that disrupt the enemy's communications and other signal emitter systems. It also transmits false communications that deceive enemy forces through their own information collection systems. (3) EW assets are targeted in much the same way as artillery and other weapon systems. (4) EA includes jamming and deception. c. Define electronic warfare support ( ES ) . (1) Enemy sources of ra diated electromagnetic energy are searched for, located, and identified through a process called ES . (2) ES focuses on the immediate requirements of the tactical commander. (3) ES includes the efforts to search, identify, intercept, and locate electron ic emitters. d. Define electronic protection (EP). (1) Defensive EW seeks to protect friendly use of the electroma g netic spectrum by employing EP."},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":" Skill Level 3 301 - 371 - 1150 3 - 283 S kill L evel 3 Performance Steps (2) EP is the action s taken to protect friendly command, control, and communication (C3) from enemy co llection and disruption efforts. (3) EP is planned around the commander's mission and concept of operations, and is the responsibility of the operations officer (G3/S3). Based on the mission, those communications and electronic systems that must be protected are identified and their vulnerability to enemy EA is assessed. The operation of these systems is then planned and monitored to ensure that the times, frequencies, duration, and location of their emi s sions provide the greatest possible security from enemy collection and disruption efforts. Note . FM 34 - 10 and FM 34 - 25 have not been updated to reflect current IEW terminology. These manuals refer to e lectronic attack (EA) as e lectronic counte r measures (ECM), e lectronic warfare support (ES ) as e lectronic warfare support measures (ESM) and e lectronic protection (EP) as e lectronic counter - countermeasures (ECCM). 5. Determine the role of counterintelligence (CI). a. Counters the hostile intelligence threat. b. Safeguards the command from surprise. c. Deceives the enemy. d. Counters enemy sabotage, subversion, and terrorism. 6. Identify the major intelligence disciplines. a. Human intelligence (HUMINT) includes all information derived through human sources not accessible to other colle ction assets. HUMINT employs overt, covert, and clandestine operations to achieve worldwide collection objectives. b. Imagery intelligence (IMINT). IMINT can be obtained from land, sea, air, and space platforms (radar, photographic, infrared, and electr o - optic imagery). c. Signals intelligence (SIGINT) is the products resulting from the co l lection, evaluation, analysis, integration, and interpretation of inform a tion derived from intercepted electromagnetic emissions. d. Measurement and signature intell igence (MASINT) is scientific and technical intelligence obtained by quantitative and qualitative analysis of data derived from technical sensors for the purpose of identifying any distinctive features associated with the source, emitter, or sender and to facilitate subsequent identification or measurement. 7.

He identifies intell i gence requirements based on the commander's guidance and concept of the operation. b. The G3 has staff responsibility for planning and directing the ja m ming and deception operations of the comma nd. He directs EA actions needed to support planned and ongoing operations. He identifies, in c o ordination with the G2, ES requirements to support EW. c. The m ilitary intelligence (MI) unit commander manages the MI a s sets to accomplish the assigned EW missions. He exercises command and control (C2) over all organic and attached MI elements and oper a tional control (OPCON) over supporting MI assets. 9. Identify how IEW is integrated into the combined arms team. a. Division tactical operati ons center support element (DTOCSE) augments the G2 and G3. Part of this element, the electronic warfare section (EWS), is the principle mission manager for EA. The EWS is also involved with the fire support element in the targeting process. b. The anal ysis and control element (ACE), formerly referred to as the technical control and analysis element (TCAE), is part of the MI ba t talion tactical operations center (TOC) and is the asset manager for all ES and EA missions tasked to the MI battalion. c. Inte lligence and electronic warfare support element (IEWSE) is attached to the maneuver brigade TOC from the MI battalion.

Determine the number of personnel who need to be trained. Check local unit personnel training records to determine the number of qualified combat lifesavers and distribution of the CLs by squad. (See step 9, Ensure combat lifesavers maintain proficiency.) Note . There should be at least one co mbat lifesaver per squad, crew, or equivalent - size unit. Note . If there are too few soldiers to be trained, check other units in the area about combining students for the course. There is the possibility you may have too many students requiring more frequent classes until the required number are trained. Note . Recommend that all qualified combat lifesavers notify the combat lifesaver c o ordinator as soon as a new assignment notification is received.
