Survivability doctrine addresses when, where, and how fighting and protective battlefield positions are prepared for individual soldiers, troop units, vehicles, weapons, and equipment. This manual implements survivability tactics for all branches of the combined arms team. Battlefield survival critically depends on the quality of protection afforded by the positions. The full spectrum of survivability encompasses planning and locating position sites, designing adequate overhead cover, analyzing terrain conditions and construction materials, selecting excavation methods, and countering the effects of direct and indirect fire weapons. This manual is intended for engineer commanders, noncommissioned officers, and staff officers who support and advise the combined arms team, as well as combat arms commanders and staff officers who establish priorities, allocate resources, and integrate combat engineer support.

To achieve success, our forces must gain the initiative, deploy in depth, and stress ag ility and synchronizati on of activities and functions. Such an approach will prevent the en emy from freely maneuvering forces in depth to reinforce an attack, build up a defense, or counter attack. In the next fast-paced battle, our forces must protect themselves as never before from a wide range of highly tec hnical weapons systems. Thus, in both the offense and defense, we will have to be ever-conscious of the enemy's ability to detect, engage, and destroy us. Careful planning and diligent work will enhance our ability to survive. Survivability doctrine addresses five major point s significant to the AirLand battlefield: 1. Maneuver units have primary responsibility to develop, position, and begin building their own positions. 2. The engineer's ultimate role in survivabi lity is set by the maneuver commander controlling engineer resources. 3. Based on those resources, engineer support w ill supplement units as determined by the supported commander's priorities."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"FM 5-103_____________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________ 1-2 4. Engineer support will concentrat e on missions requiring unique engi neer skills or equipment. 5. Survivability measures begin with using all available concealment and natural cover, followed by simple digging and constructing fighting and pr otective positions. As time and the tactical situation permit, these positions are improved. The following AirLand battle conditions will shap e our protection and survivability efforts: • • The need to win at the forward line of our own troops (FLOT), conduct deep battle operations, and overcome threats in the rear area. • The use of effective firepower and decisive maneuver. • The existence of a nonlinear battlefield resul ting from dissolution of battle lines and areas due to maneuvering, and rapid dispersion from areas of nuclear and chemical weapons effects. • Coordinated air/ground operati ons involving frequent move ment by friendly troops. • Proliferation of nuclear and chemical tactical weaponry. • Active reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition efforts through visual, remote sensing radar, and tactical radi o direction finding procedures. • Reliance on electronic warfare as a combat multiplier. THE THREAT During the next battle, US forces are likely to en counter or work with na tions of widely diverse political systems, economic capabili ties, cultures, and armies. Whether the battle is with Warsaw Pact or Third World countries, US forces will be exposed to S oviet-style weaponry and tactics. The following outline of Threat tactics and bat tle priorities provides a key to understanding survivability requirements for US forces. (See Field Manuals (FMs) 100-2-1, 100-2-2, and 100- 2-3 for more detailed information.) DIRECT FIRE WEAPONS The opposing Threat is an offensiv ely-oriented force that uses massive amounts of firepower to enhance the maneuverability, mobility, agility, an d shock of its weaponry. It seeks to identify and exploit weak points from the front to the rear of enemy formations. The tank is the Threat's primary ground combat weapon, supplemented by ar mored personnel carriers (APCs) and other armored fighting vehicles. Large mechanized forma tions are used to attack in echelons, with large amounts of supporting suppre ssive direct and indi rect fire. To achieve surprise, Threat forces train to operate in all types of terra in and during inclement weather. Threat force commanders train for three types of offensive act ion: the attack against a defending enemy, the meeting engagement, and the pursuit. The Attack Against a Defending Enemy Threat forces concentrate their attack at a weak point in the enemy's defensive formation. Threat doctrine emphasizes three basi c forms of maneuver when a ttacking a defending force:"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"_____________________________________________________________________FM 5-103 1-3 envelopment, frontal attack, and flank attack. Penetration of enemy defenses is the ultimate objective in all three operations. The Threat force uses echeloned forces in this effort, and their goal is to fight through to the enemy rear and pursue retreating forces. Threat attacks of strongly-defended positions will usually have a heavy air and artillery preparation. As this preparation is lifted and shifted to the dept hs of the enemy, advance guard units conduct operations to test the strength of the remaining defenders. Critical targets are reduced by artillery or by ground attacks conduc ted by advancing armor-heavy main forces. These forces attack from the march unless they are forced to deploy into attack formations by either the defending force or terrain conditions . The Threat seeks to overwhelm its enemy by simultaneously attacking as many weak points as possible. If weak poi nts cannot be found, the Threat deploys into concentrated attack forma tions, usually organized into two echelons and a small reserve. These formations are initially dispersed to limit nuclear destruction, but are concentrated enough to meet offensive norms for attack. The Threat attacks defensive positions in a column formation and continues the attack in to depths of the defense. Threat regimental artillery directly support s battalions, companies, and platoons for the duration of the engagement. United States Forces United States defending forces conduct extens ive survivability operations during an enemy attack. Preliminary activities include deliberat e position construction and hardening for both weapons and command and supply positions. Alte rnate and supplementary positions are also located and prepared if time allows. Finally, cove red routes between these positions are selected, and camouflage of all structures is accomplished. The Meeting Engagement The meeting engagement is the type of offensive action most preferred by Th reat forces. It relies on a standard battle drill executed from the marc h using combined arms forces and attached artillery support. Threat doctrine stresses rapid maneuver of fo rces and attacking while its enemy is on the march--not when it is in a prepared defense. Attacking a defending enemy requires superiority of forces--a requirement the Threat seeks to avoid. The meeting engagement begins as the Threat advance guard of a combined arms force makes contact with the enemy advancing force. As soon as contact is made, the Threat battle drill begins. When possible, the main Threat force mane uvers its advance guard to a flank and attacks. This preliminary maneuver is supported by a barr age from the Threat force organic artillery which has deployed at the first sign of contact. The Threat forc e then makes a quick flank or frontal attack on enemy forces as they adva nce support their engaged advancing forces. Upon withdrawal from contact and as the enemy force reacts to the flank attack, the Threat reconnaissance force continues its a dvance. This tactic then relies on the elements of surprise and shock for success. The Threat seeks to disable the enemy force along the depth of the enemy's formation. "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"FM 5-103_____________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________ 1-4 United States Forces When US forces are involved in a meeting enga gement, survivability operations are needed, but not as much as in the deliberate defense. Hast ily prepared fighting and protective positions are essential but will often be prepared without en gineer assistance or equipment. Maneuver units must also use natural terrain for fighting and protective positions. The Pursuit The pursuit of retreating forces by a Threat ad vancing force takes place as leading echelons bypass strongpoints and heavy engagements and a llow following echelons to take up the fight. After any penetration is achieved, Threat doctrine calls for an a ggressive pursuit and drive into the enemy rear area. This often leaves encirc led and bypassed units for follow-on echelon forces to destroy. United States Forces Survivability in retrograde operations or during pu rsuit by the Threat force presents a significant challenge to the survivability planner. During retrograde operations, prot ective positions--both within the delay and fallback locations--are requ ired for the delaying force. Company-size delay and fall back fighting and protective positions ar e most often prepared. Planning and preparing the positions requires knowledge of withdrawal routes and sequence. INDIRECT FIRE WEAPONS Threat commanders want to achieve precise levels of destruction through implementation of the rolling barrage, concentrated fire, or a combinati on of the two. Combined with tactical air strikes and fires from direct fire weapons , these destruction levels are- • • Harassment with 10 percent loss of personnel and equipment; organizational structure is retained. • Neutralization with 25 to 30 percent de struction of personnel and equipment; effectiveness is seriously limited. • Total destruction with 50 percent or more destruction of personnel and equipment. The Threat can plan for the total destruction of a strongpoint by delivering up to 200 rounds of artillery, or 320 rounds from their medium rock et launcher, per 100 meter square. Thus, the Threat force attacks with a full complement of di rect and indirect fire weapons when targets of opportunity arise or when the tactical situation permits. United States Forces To survive against this tremendous indirect fire threat, US forces must counter the physical effects of indirect fire, such as fragmentation and blast. Protection from these effects creates a large demand for engineer equipment, materials, and personnel. Careful c onsideration of the time"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"_____________________________________________________________________FM 5-103 1-5 and construction materials available for the desired level of survivability is necessary. Therefore, priorities of construction are necessary. Cove red dismounted firing positions and shelters adjacent to large weapons emplacements are co nstructed by maneuver units, usually without engineer assistance. The mane uver commander must prioritize the construction of overhead cover for command, control, and supply positions. NUCLEAR WEAPONS Threat plans and operations for their nuclear systems are ranked in the following order: • • Destroy US nuclear delivery systems, nucle ar weapons stocks, and the associated command and control apparatus. • Destroy US main force groupings. • Breach US main lines of defense. • Establish attack corridors with in US battlefield boundaries. Threat nuclear targeting pl ans are based on the use of massive amounts of supporting conventional direct and indirect fire. These massi ve artillery barrages enable the use of Threat nuclear weapons systems against targets which c onventional weapons cannot destroy or disable. United States Forces Due to the multiple effects of a nuclear detonation, survivabili ty operations against nuclear weapons are difficult. Thermal, blast, and radia tion effects require separa te consideration when designing protection. However, fortifications e ffective against modern conventional weapons will vary in effectiveness against nuclear weapons. CHEMICAL WEAPONS Often, Threat forces may use massive surprise ch emical strikes in conjunction with nuclear and conventional attacks. These chemical strikes ar e aimed at destroying opp osing force offensive capability, as well as disrupting logistics and contaminating all vulnerable rear area targets. United States Forces United States (US) forces must plan to fight, as well as survive, on a chemical contaminated battlefield. Open or partially open emplacemen ts afford no protection from chemical or biological attack. Personnel in open emplaceme nts or nonprotected vehicles must use proper chemical protective clothing and masks to avoi d chemical vapors and biological aerosols. DEEP ATTACK Threat doctrine dictates that the attack must advance to the enemy rear area as quickly as possible. To supplement this main attack, the Th reat may deploy its airborne, airmobile, or light forces to fight in the enemy rear until relieve d by advancing forces. In most cases, smaller"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"FM 5-103_____________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________ 1-6 airborne/airmobile forces (batta lion or regimental size s) are deployed to st rike targets in the enemy rear which are critical to the success of Th reat forces. Additionall y, covert reconnaissance missions or sabotage and harassment missions ar e accomplished by small Threat teams deployed in the rear. All of the Threat fo rces involved in a deep attack ar e trained and equipped to operate in contaminated environments. Threat organization in the deep attack normally consists of the airborne/airmobile battalion for missions involving a long-range strike group. Op erational maneuver groups will also conduct deep attacks using armor heavy forces. Organiza tion for covert reconnai ssance is normally a platoon-or company-size r econnaissance element. United States Forces When attacks on rear areas are made by Thr eat force aircraft, or by covert or overt airborne/airmobile forces, r ear area activities are suscep tible to many of the weapons encountered in the forward area. Thus, survivab ility of these rear ar ea activities depends on adequate protective construction before the at tack. Technical Manual (TM) 5-855-1 describes permanent protective cons truction in detail. ROLE OF US FORCES COMMANDER'S ROLE Commanders of all units must know their requirements for protection. They must also understand the principles of fighting positions an d protective positions, as well as the level of protection needed, given limited engi neer assistance. Survivability measures are subdivided into two main categories: fighting positions for protection of personnel and equipment directly involved in combat; and protective positions for protection of personnel and equipment not directly involved w ith fighting the enemy. In order to protect their troops in the combat zone, commanders or leaders must fully understand the importance of fighting positions, both in the offense and in the defense. The ini tial responsibility for position preparation belongs with the maneuver commander's own troops. Even with in the fluid nature of the AirLand battle, every effort to fortify positions is made to ensure greater protection and survivability. ENGINEER'S ROLE The engineer's contribution to battlefield success is in the five mission areas of mobility, countermobility, survivability, general engineer ing, and topographic engineering. Although units are required to develop their own covered an d/or concealed positions for individual and dismounted crew-served weapons, available engin eer support will assist in performing major survivability tasks beyond the unit's capabilities. While the engineer effort concentrates on developing those facilities to wh ich the equipment is best suit ed, the engineer also assists supported units to develop other survivability m easures within their capabilities. Before the battle begins, training as a combined arms team al lows engineers to assist other team members in developing the survivability plan."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"_____________________________________________________________________FM 5-103 1-7 Survivability on the modern battlefield, then, depends on progressive development of fighting and protective positions. That is , the field survivability planne r must recognize that physical protection begins with the judici ous use of available terrain. It is then enhanced through the continual improvement of that terrain. In the Offense In the offense of the AirLand battle, fighting a nd protective position development is minimal for tactical vehicles and weapons systems. The emph asis is on mobility of the force. Protective positions for artillery, air defense, and logistics po sitions are required in the offense and defense, although more so in the defense. Also, command and control facilities require protection to lessen their vulnerability. During halts in the advance, units sh ould develop as many protective positions as possible for antitank weapons, indire ct fire weapons, and critical supplies. For example, expedient earth excavations or parapets are located to make the best use of existing terrain. During the early planning st ages, the terrain analysis teams at division, corps, and theater levels can provide information on soil conditions, vegetative concealment, and terrain masking along the routes of march. Each position design s hould include camouflage from the start, with deception techniques developed as the situation and time permit. In the Defense Defensive missions demand the greatest surviv ability and protective construction effort. Activities in the defense include constructing protective positions for command and control artillery, air defense, and critical equipment and supplies. They also incl ude preparing individual and crew-served weapons positions and defila de fighting positions for fighting vehicles. Meanwhile, countermobility operations will comp ete with these surviv ability activities for engineer assistance. Here again, maneuver comma nders must instruct their crews to prepare initial positions without engineer help. As c ountermobility activities ar e completed, engineers will help improve those survivability positions. Two key factors in defensive position fighting deve lopment are: proper siting in relation to the surrounding terrain, and proper siting for the most effective employment of key weapons systems such as antitank guided missiles (ATGMs), crew-s erved weapons, and tanks. Critical elements for protective positions are command and contro l facilities, supply, and ammunition areas since these will be targeted first by the Threat. The degree of protection for these facilities is determined by the probability of acquisition,and not simply by the general threat. Facilities emitting a strong electromagnetic signal, or substan tial thermal and visual signature, require full protection against the Threat. Electronic counter measures and deception activities are mandatory and an integral part of all activities in the defense. COMBAT/COMBAT SUPPORT ROLE The survivability requirements for the following units are shown collectively in the table on Survivability Requirements."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"FM 5-103_____________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________ 1-8 "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"_____________________________________________________________________FM 5-103 1-9 "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"FM 5-103_____________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________ 1-10 "},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"_____________________________________________________________________FM 5-103 1-11 Light Infantry Light infantry units include rifle, airborne, air assault, and ranger units. They are ideally suited for close-in fighting against a force which has equal mobility or a mobility advantage which is degraded or offset. Difficult terrain, obstacles, and/or weather can degrade a mobility advantage. Surprise or stealth can offset a mobility advantage. In restricted terrain such as cities, forests, or mountains, light infantry units are also a challenge to enemy armor forces. Due to the lack of substantial armor protecti on, light infantry units may require extensive fighting positions for individual and crew-ser ved weapons, antitank weapons, and vehicles."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"FM 5-103_____________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________ 1-12 Command and control facilities require prot ective positions. The defense requires fortified positions when terrain use is critical and when covered routes are required between positions. Light forces readily use local materials to develop fighti ng positions and bunkers rapidly. Priorities are quickly established for position de velopment-first to antitank and crew-served weapon positions, and then to command and cont rol facilities and vita l logistics positions. Artillery positions must have hardening impr ovements soon after emplacement is complete. In air assault units, aircraft protecti on is given high priority. Aircraft is dispersed and parapets or walls are constructed when possible. Mechanized Infantry Mechanized infantry operations in both the o ffense and the defense are characterized by rapid location changes and changes from fighting mounted to fighting dismounted. Mechanized infantry units normally fight integrated with tanks, primarily to destroy enemy infantry and antitank defenses. When forced to fight dism ounted, such units need support by fire from weapons on board their APCs or infantry fightin g vehicles (IFVs). When the terrain is not suitable for tracked vehicles or vi sibility is severely restricted, mechanized infantry may have to fight dismounted without the s upport of APCs or IFVs. When m ounted, mechanized forces rely heavily on terrain positioning for fighting posi tions. Fighting positions increase survivability when the situation and time permit construction. Armor The tank is the primary offensive weapon in moun ted warfare. Its firepow er, protection from enemy fire, and speed create the shock effect ne cessary to disrupt the enemy's operations. Tanks destroy enemy armored vehicles and suppress en emy infantry and ATGMs. Armor and infantry form the nucleus of the combined arms team and both complement and reinforce each other. Infantry assists the advance of tanks in difficu lt terrain, while armor provides protection in open terrain, thus providing flexibility during combined arms maneuver. Armor units rely on terrain positioning to decr ease vulnerability. When po ssible, these terrain fighting positions are reinforced (deepened) by excavation. Protective positions for thin-skinned and lightly-armored support vehicles, as well as command posts and critic al supplies, require significant hardening. Armor units enhance protection by construc ting alternate and supplementary positions and defi ning routes between them. Armored and Air Cavalry Armored cavalry units need minimal fighting and protective positions. They rely almost totally on effective use of maneuver and terrain to re duce the acquisition thre at. Air cavalry units, performing the same reconnaissance and security missions as ground armored cavalry, require somewhat more protective constr uction. Protective revetments and/ or parapets are required at forward arming and refueling points (FARPs) and, in some cases, at forward assembly areas. These activities are always time consuming and supplement the basic survivability enhancement techniques of dispersion and camouflage."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"_____________________________________________________________________FM 5-103 1-13 Aviation Army aviation units, in addition to air cavalry un its, consist of attack helicopter and combat support aviation forces. Attack he licopter units are aerial mane uver units which provide highly maneuverable antiarmor firepower. They are ideally suited for employment in situations where rapid reaction time is important, or wh ere terrain restricts ground forces. Combat support aviation units give dismounted infantry and ground antitank units tactical mobility. This enables them to move rapidly to the enemy's flanks or rear, or to reposition rapidly in the defense. Combat support aviation units can quickly m ove towed field artillery units and other lighter combined arms team elements as the commander dictates. They also provide critical supplies to forward areas in the defens e and attacking formations when groundlines of communications have been interdicted. Protection for Army aviation units is employed with full consideration to time constraints, logistical constraints, and the tactical situation. The primary m eans for aircraft protection on the ground is a combination of terrain masking, c over and concealment, effective camouflage, and dispersion. When possible, protec tive parapets and revetments ar e built. Aircraft logistics facilities, including FARPs and ma intenance facilities, require additional pr otective construction. The FARPs require some protection of supplie s and ordnance through the use of protective parapets and bunkers. They also require fighting positions for occupants of the points. Field Artillery Field artillery is the main fire support element in battlefield fire and maneuver. Field artillery is capable of suppressing enemy direct fire for ces, attacking enemy ar tillery and mortars, suppressing enemy air defenses, and delivering scat terable mines to isolate and interdict enemy forces or protect friendl y operations. It integrates all means of fire support available to the commander and is often as mobile as any mane uver force it supports. Fighting and protective position use is one of several altern atives the field artillery leader must evaluate. This alternate may be alone or in combination with other surv ivability operations, such as frequent moves and adequate dispersion. Counterfire from enemy artillery is the most freq uent threat to artillery units. Dug-in positions and/or parapet positions, as well as existing terrain and facilities , can provide protection. Threat acquisition and targeting activities are heavily used agains t artillery and are supplemented by some covert Threat deep ground attacks. Thus, personnel and equipment need some direct fire protection. Fire direction centers and battery operation centers shoul d be protected with hardened bunkers or positions to defeat counterfire designed to eliminate artillery control. In urban areas, existing structur es offer considerable protection. Preparation for these is minimal compared to the level of protection. The us e of self-propelled and towed equipment for positioning and hardening efforts enhance surviv ability. Some self-propelled units have significant inherent protection and maneuverability which allow more flexibility in protective structure design."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"FM 5-103_____________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________ 1-14 Combat Engineers Combat engineers contribute to the combined ar ms team by performing the missions of mobility, countermobility, survivability, topographic operations , general engineering, and fight as infantry. Mobility missions include breaching enemy minefie ld and obstacles, route improvement and construction, and water-crossing operations. Countermobility missions include the enhancement of fire through obsta cle and minefield employment. Survivability missions enhance the total su rvivability of the force through figh ting and protective position construction. Topographic operations engineering missions include de tailed terrain analysis, terrain overlays, trafficability studies, evaluation of co ver and concealment, soils maps, and other information to base mobility, countermobility, and survivability decisions. General engineering missions support theater armies with bot h vertical and horiz ontal construction capabilities. Combat engineer fighting and protective position requirements depend on the type and location of the mission being performed in support of th e combined arms team. Personnel and equipment protective positions are used when project sites are located within an area that the Threat can acquire. Engineers have limited inherent protectio n in vehicles and equi pment and will require fighting positions, protective command and contro l, and critical supply bunkers when under an enemy attack. When time is available and when the mission permits, revetments and parapets can protect construction equipment. Ge nerally, engineers use the same methods of protection used to protect the maneuver for ce they are supporting. When engineers fight as infantry, they employ protective measures similar to those required by light or mechanized infantry forces. Air Defense Artillery Air defense units provide security from enemy air attack by destroying or driving off enemy aircraft and helicopters. Their fi re degrades the effectiveness of enemy strike and reconnaissance aircraft by forcing the enemy to evade friendly air defense. Short-range air defense systems normally provide forward air defense protecti on for maneuver units whether the units are attacking, delaying, withdrawing, or repositioning in the defense. Air defense units also provide security for critical faci lities and installations. The main technique for air defens e artillery (ADA) survivability is frequent movement. Because their main mission is to protect divisional and co rps assets, ADA units are a high-priority target for suppression or attack by enemy artillery a nd tactical aircraft. Signature acquisition equipment, smoke, dust, contrails associated w ith firing, and siting requirements allow them to conduct their mission. Available terrain is generally used for cover and concealment since little time is available for deliberate protective construction. Dummy positions are constructed whenever possible, since they may draw significan t enemy artillery fire and aircraft attack. The ADA equipment used is usually protected by parapets, revetments, or dug-in positions similar to infantry and armor/tracked vehicle positions as long as fields of fire for the systems are"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"_____________________________________________________________________FM 5-103 1-15 maintained. Deliberate protective construction is always done when systems are employed to defend fixed installations, command posts, or logistics systems. Unit Support Systems Several types of combat support equipment a nd their positions are considered unit support systems. These systems include communications and power generation equipment, field trains, forward supply points, decontamination sites, an d water points. Protection for each of these positions depends greatly on their battlefield lo cation and on the mission's complexity. Protective measures for both equipment and organic and su pported personnel are norm ally provided. Initial positioning of these systems takes full advantage of terrain masking, cover and concealment, and terrain use to enhance camouflage activities. Major Logistics Systems and Rear Areas Major logistics systems and rear area operations include rear area supply depots; petroleum, oils, and lubricants (POL) tank/bladder farms; rear ar ea/depot level maintenance activities; and so on. Survivability planners are most concerned with denial of acquisition and targeting of these positions by the Threat. A combination of camoufla ge and deception activities is usually used to conceal major logistics system activities. Actual survivability measures used to protec t large activities depend on the type of threat anticipated and target analysis. The obvious threat to large facilities is conventional or nuclear/chemical artillery, or missile or air atta ck. These facilities need physical protection and built-in hardening. A less obvious threat is covert activities be gun after a Threat insertion of deep-strike ground forces. Measures to counter th is type of threat include some fighting and protective positions designed to defeat a ground force or direct fire threat."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 2-1 CHAPTER 2 SURVIVABILITY ANALYSIS THE PLANNING PROCESS This section outlines the information needed and the decision-making process required for executing survivability missions. Increased engin eer requirements on the AirLand battlefield will limit engineer resources supporting survivability . Mobility, countermobility, survivability (M- CM-S), and general engineering requirements ar e in competition for the same engineer assets. Survivability requirements are compared with th e tactical need and the need for mobility and countermobility operations. The maneuver commander sets the priorities which allow the force to perform critical tasks. The successful force must have enough flexibility to recognize and make immediate necessary changes on the battlefield. DECISION MAKING Both the commander and staff are involved in the military decision-making process. It provides courses of action for the commander and, by selec ting the best course, en hances survivability. The staff input in the decision-making process for planning survivability missions includes: • • Military intelligence (enemy activity, te rrain, weather, and weapon types). • Operations (tactical maneuver, fire support, and engineer support)."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"FM 5-103_____________________________________________________________________ 2-2 • Administration/logistics (personnel and co mbat services supp ort activities). • Civil affairs (civilians possibly affected by military operations). PLANNING SEQUENCE The engineer prepares or assists in the preparation of survivabili ty estimates and plans to support the survivability effort s of the entire unit. In organizat ions without a staff engineer, the operations officer performs the analysis and formulates survivability plans. The following sequence is used to develop surviv ability support options and plans. • • Mission and commander's guidance are received. • Time available is considered. • Threat situation and Threat direct and indirect assets are analyzed. • Friendly situation and su rvivability support resources are evaluated. • Survivability data, including terrain analysis results, is evaluated. • Possible courses of act ion are developed. • The Survivability portion of the engineer estimate is prepared. • Courses of action constraints are compared w ith actual engineer re sources available. • Plans are prepared, orders are issued , and staff supervision is conducted. The survivability planning process is completed when the survivability estimates and plans are combined with those for mobility, counterm obility, and general engineering. The maneuver commander then has a basis for deciding ta sk priorities and allocating support. DATA COLLECTION INFORMATION ON METT-T Information on mission, enemy, terrain and weathe r, time, and troops (METT-T) is compiled. The Mission Subordinate commanders/leaders must understa nd the maneuver commander's mission and guidance. The commander/ leader must know what survivability tasks are necessary and how they interface with mobility, countermobility, and other tasks necessary for completing the mission. In addition, the commander/leader implem enting survivability tasks must know if any additional support is available. The Enemy The maneuver commander and engineer must fully understand the threat to the force. Weapon types, probable number of weapons and rounds, and types of attack to expect are critical in survivability planning. When th ese factors are known, appropr iate fighting and protective positions are designed and constructed. "},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"_____________________________________________________________________FM 5-103 2-3 Terrain and Weather One of the most important sources of info rmation the maneuver commander and supporting engineer receive is a detailed te rrain analysis of the area. Th is analysis is provided by the division terrain team (DTT) or co rps terrain team (CTT). It include s the types of te rrain, soil, and weather in the area of operations. A good mental picture of the area of operations enables the commander to evaluate all M-CM-S and general engi neering activities to create the best plan for attack or defense. Time Every survivability mission has a deadline for reaching a predetermined level of protection. Hardening activities will continue past the deadlin e and are done as long as the force remains in the position. Survivability time constraints are deeply intertwined with mobility and countermobility time constraints. If the level of protection required cannot be achieved in the time allotted, resources are then committed to mobility or countermobility operations, or as designated by the maneuver commander. Troops and Resources The commander must weigh available labor, materi al constraints, and en gineer support before planning an operation. Labor constr aints are identified th rough analysis of th e three sources of labor-maneuver unit troops, engineer troops, and indigenous (host nation/local area) personnel. Supply and equipment constraints are identified through analysis of on-hand supplies, naturally- available materials, and supplies available th rough military and indigenous channels. Careful procurement consideration is given to availabl e civilian engineer equipment to supplement military equipment. INFORMATION ON INTELLIGENCE The maneuver force commander and engineer mu st have access to available intelligence information provided by staff elem ents. Battalion S2 sections pr ovide the bulk of reconnaissance and terrain information, and expe rts at the division level and a bove assist the commander. For example, the DS terrain team, the production sec tion of the division tactical operations center (DTOC) support element, and the corps cartogr aphic company can quickly provide required terrain products. In addition, the commander uses the division intelligence system which provides the Threat order of battle and war-damaged key faci lities.

Using these factors in a vulnerability analys is will show the maneuver commander and the engineer which maneuver, field artillery, and ADA units require the most survivability support. The table Equipment to be Protected lists w eapons systems in these units requiring fighting position/protective position construction. PROTECTION PRIORITIES Based on a vulnerability analysis of systems that need protecting in the tactical situation, the maneuver commander develops the pr iorities for protective activities. Setting survivability priorities is a manuever commander's decision based on the engineer's advice. Using the protection criteria discussed earlier, and an up-to-date detailed terr ain analysis portraying the de gree of natural protection, a commander develops and ranks a detailed tactical c onstruction plan to support survivability efforts. This detailed plan is usually broken dow n into several priority groupings or levels of protection. Primary, supplementary, and alternat e positions are developed in stages or in increasing increments of protection."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"_____________________________________________________________________FM 5-103 2-5 The table below shows example standard survivab ility levels for maneuver units in defensive positions.

General priorities for protective constr uction in a defensive battle position are- • • Antitank weapon protection. • Tank position development. • Armored personnel carrier (APC) position development. • Command post position hardening. • Combat support position (including field artiller y, ADA, mortars, and so on) hardening. • Crew-served weapons position, individual figh ting position, and covered routes between battle positions. PROTECTION PLANNING Operations Staff Officer Priorities of work are recommended by the maneuve r operations staff officer with input from the engineer. Survivability requirements for a defe nsive operation might receive the commander's first priority for engineer work. However, thes e tasks may require using only 10 percent of the engineer resources, while countermobili ty tasks may demand 70 percent. The maneuver commander establishes engineer work priorities and sets priorities for tasks within the functions just mentioned. Using an analysis of what equipment requires protection, what priorities are set for sequential protection of the equipment, and which equipment and personnel require immediate protection, the maneuver co mmander can set individual priorities for survivability work. Engineer Staff Officer Survivability data and recommendati ons are presented to the commander or supported unit through an engineer staff estimate. The engine er estimate includes a recommendation for task organization and mobility, countermobility, survivab ility, and general engineering task priorities. Instructions for developing the engineer estimate are contained in FM 5-100. Tasks Organizations Various command and support relations hips under which engineer a ssets are task-organized can enhance mission accomplishment. The available asse ts are applied to each original course of action in a manner best suited to the METT-T fact ors and the survivabilit y analysis.

Field Manual 5-100 discusses engineer input to OPORDs. It is impossible to divide responsibilities in survivability missions between the maneuver commander and the engineer commander. Maneuver Commander"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"_____________________________________________________________________FM 5-103 2-9 The maneuver commander is responsible for or ganizing, planning, coordi nating, and effectively using engineer resources to accomplish the survivability mission. The maneuver commander must rely on the engineer staff officer or supporting engineer commande r to provide analyses and recommendations for protective constr uction and fighting position employment. The commander implements decisions by setting prioriti es and further defining the constraints of the mission to the engineer. Engineer Commander The engineer commander, in addition to fulfilling advisory responsibilities to the maneuver commander, accomplishes tasks in support of the overall survivability mission as follows: • • Insures timely reports concerning survivability ta sks are made to the engineer staff officer or the operations and plans officer (G3/S3). • Develops survivability operational plans. • Insures engineer tasks are supervised, whethe r or not they are perf ormed using engineer labor. • Inspects fighting and protective posi tions for structural soundness. • Provides advice and repair estimates for fi ghting and protective positions built or occupied by supported units. • Recommends and identifies uses for engineer support in survivabil ity operations through the sequence of command and staff actions. • Evaluates terrain to determine the best areas for construction of survivability systems. Joint Responsibilities Based on knowledge of fighting and protective pos ition effectiveness and protection ability, the engineer continues to advise the maneuver commander on survivability matters following the location, construction, and/or re pair of these positions. The engineer provides valuable information to aid in decision-making for deployment to alternate and supplementary positions and retrograde operations. The engineer keeps the maneuver commander informed on the level of fighting that the existing fighting and protec tive positions support, and what protection the covered routes provide when move ment between positions occurs. STAFF OFFICERS' RESPONSIBILITIES The engineer staff officers' (B rigade Engineer, Assistant Di vision Engineer) responsibilities include Coordination of mobility, countermobility, survivability, and general engineering tasks on the battlefield. As a special member of the commander's staff, the engineer interacts with other staff personnel. This is accomplished by inte grating survivability cons iderations with plans and actions of the other staff me mbers. Staff responsibilities c oncerning survivability plans and execution are as follows. G2/S2"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"FM 5-103_____________________________________________________________________ 2-10 The G2/S2 is the primary staff officer for in telligence matters and has responsibility for collecting information on Threat operations and types and numbers of weapons used.

The positions provide necessary protection for personnel, yet allow for fields of fire and maneuver. A protective position protects the personnel and/or material not directly involved with fighting the enemy from attack or environmental extremes. In order to develop plans for fighting and protective positions, five types of weapons, their effects, and their survivability considerations are presented. Air-delivered weapons such as ATGMs, laser-guided missiles, mines, and large bombs require similar survivability considerations. DIRECT FIRE Direct fire projectiles are primarily designed to strike a target with a velocity high enough to achieve penetration. The chemical energy projectile uses some form of chemical heat and blast to achieve penetration. It detonates either at impact or when maximum penetration is achieved. Chemical energy projectiles carrying impact-detonated or delayed detonation high-explosive charges are used mainly for direct fire from systems with high accuracy and consistently good target acquisition ability. Tanks, antitank weapons, and automatic cannons usually use these types of projectiles."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"FM 5-103 _____________________________________________________________________ 3-2 The kinetic energy projectile uses high velocity and mass (momentum) to penetrate its target. Currently, the hypervelocity projectile causes the most concern in survivability position design. The materials used must dissipate the projectile's energy and thus prevent total penetration. Shielding against direct fire projectiles should initially stop or deform the projectiles in order to prevent or limit penetration. Direct fire projectiles are further divided into the categories of ball and tracer, armor piercing and armor piercing incendiary, and high explosive (HE) rounds. Ball and Tracer Ball and tracer rounds are normally of a relatively small caliber (5.56 to 14.5 millimeters (mm)) and are fired from pistols, rifles, and machine guns. The round's projectile penetrates soft targets on impact at a high velocity. The penetration depends directly on the projectile's velocity, weight, and angle at which it hits. Armor Piercing and Armor Piercing Incendiary Armor piercing and armor piercing incendiary rounds are designed to penetrate armor plate and other types of homogeneous steel. Armor piercing projectiles have a special jacket encasing a hard core or penetrating rod which is designed to penetrate when fired with high accuracy at an angle very close to the perpendicular of the target. Incendiary projectiles are used principally to penetrate a target and ignite its contents. They are used effectively against fuel supplies and storage areas. High Explosive High explosive rounds include high explosive antitank (HEAT) rounds, recoilless rifle rounds, and antitank rockets. They are designed to detonate a shaped charge on impact. At detonation, an extremely high velocity molten jet is formed. This jet perforates large thicknesses of high-density material, continues along its path, and sets fuel and ammunition on fire. The HEAT rounds generally range in size from 60 to 120 mm. Survivability Considerations Direct fire survivability considerations include oblique impact, or impact of projectiles at other than a perpendicular angle to the structure, which increases the apparent thickness of the"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"_____________________________________________________________________FM 5-103 3-3 structure and decreases the possibility of penetration. The potential for ricochet off a structure increases as the angle of impact from the perpendicular increases. Designers of protective structures should select the proper material and design exposed surfaces with the maximum angle from the perpendicular to the direction of fire. Also, a low structure silhouette design makes a structure harder to engage with direct fire. INDIRECT FIRE Indirect fire projectiles used against fighting and protective positions include mortar and artillery shells and rockets which cause blast and fragmentation damage to affected structures. Blast Blast, caused by the detonation of the explosive charge, creates a shock wave which knocks apart walls or roof structures. Contact bursts cause excavation cave-in from ground shock, or structure collapse. Overhead bursts can buckle or destroy the roof. Blasts from high explosive shells or rockets can occur in three ways: • Overhead burst (fragmentation from an artillery airburst shell). • Contact burst (blast from an artillery shell exploding on impact). • Delay fuse burst (blast from an artillery shell designed to detonate after penetration into a target). The severity of the blast effects increases as the distance from the structure to the point of impact decreases. Delay fuse bursts are the greatest threat to covered structures. Repeated surface or delay fuse bursts further degrade fighting and protective positions by the cratering effect and soil discharge. Indirect fire blast effects also cause concussions. The shock from a high explosive round detonation causes headaches, nosebleeds, and spinal and brain concussions. Fragmentation Fragmentation occurs when the projectile disintegrates, producing a mass of high-speed steel fragments which can perforate and become imbedded in fighting and protective positions. The pattern or distribution of fragments greatly affects the design of fighting and protective positions."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"FM 5-103 _____________________________________________________________________ 3-4 Airburst of artillery shells provides the greatest unrestricted distribution of fragments. Fragments created by surface and delay bursts are restricted by obstructions on the ground. Survivability Considerations Indirect fire survivability from fragmentation requires shielding similar to that needed for direct fire penetration. NUCLEAR Nuclear weapons effects are classified as residual and initial. Residual effects (such as fallout) are primarily of long-term concern. However, they may seriously alter the operational plans in the immediate battle area. The figure below of tactical nuclear weapons shows how the energy released by detonation of a tactical nuclear explosion is divided. Initial effects occur in the immediate area shortly after detonation and are the most tactically significant since they cause personnel casualties and material damage within the immediate time span of any operation. The principal initial casualty producing effects are blast, thermal radiation (burning), and nuclear radiation. Other initial effects, such as electromagnetic pulse (EMP) and transient radiation effects on electronics (TREE), affect electrical and electronic equipment."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"_____________________________________________________________________FM 5-103 3-5 Blast Blast from nuclear bursts overturns and crushes equipment, collapses lungs, ruptures eardrums, hurls debris and personnel, and collapses positions and structures. Thermal Radiation Thermal radiation sets fire to combustible materials, and causes flash blindness or burns in the eyes, as well as personnel casualties from skin burns. Nuclear Radiation Nuclear radiation damages cells throughout the body. This radiation damage may cause the headaches, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea generally called \"radiation sickness\". The severity of radiation sickness depends on the extent of initial exposure. The figure below shows the relationship between dose of nuclear radiation and distance from ground zero for a 1-kiloton weapon. Once the dose is known, initial radiation effects on personnel are determined from the table below. Radiation in the body is cumulative."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"FM 5-103 _____________________________________________________________________ 3-6 "},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"_____________________________________________________________________FM 5-103 3-7 Nuclear radiation is the dominant casualty producing effect of low-yield tactical nuclear weapons.

The figure on Tactical radii shows tactical radii of effects for nominal 1-kiloton weapons."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"FM 5-103 _____________________________________________________________________ 3-8 Electromagnetic pulse Electromagnetic pulse (EMP) damages electrical and electronic equipment. It occurs at distances from the burst where other nuclear weapons effects produce little or no damage, and it lasts for less than a second after the burst. The pulse also damages vulnerable electrical and electronic equipment at ranges up to 5 kilometers for a 10-kiloton surface burst, and hundreds of kilometers for a similar high-altitude burst. Survivability Considerations Nuclear weapons survivability includes dispersion of protective positions within a suspected target area.

Personnel should habitually wear complete uniforms with hands, face, and neck covered. Nuclear radiation is minimized by avoiding the radioactive fallout area or remaining in deep- covered protective positions. Examples of expedient protective positions against initial nuclear effects are shown on the chart below. Additionally, buttoned-up armor vehicles offer limited protection from nuclear radiation. Removal of antennae and placement of critical electrical equipment into protective positions will reduce the adverse effects of EMP and TREE. "},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"FM 5-103 _____________________________________________________________________ 3-10 CHEMICAL Toxic chemical agents are primarily designed for use against personnel and to contaminate terrain and material. Agents do not destroy material and structures, but make them unusable for periods of time because of chemical contaminant absorption. The duration of chemical agent effectiveness depends on- • Weather conditions. • Dispersion methods. • Terrain conditions. • Physical properties. • Quantity used. • Type used (nerve, blood, or blister). Field Manual 21-40 provides chemical agent details and characteristics. Since the vapor of toxic chemical agents is heavier than air, it naturally tends to drift to the lowest corners or sections of a structure. Thus, low, unenclosed fighting and protective positions trap chemical vapors or agents. Because chemical agents saturate an area, access to positions without airlock entrance ways is limited during and after an attack, since every entering or exiting soldier brings contamination inside. Survivability Considerations Survivability of chemical effects includes overhead cover of any design that delays penetration of chemical vapors and biological aerosols, thereby providing additional masking time and protection against direct liquid contamination. Packing materials and covers are used to protect sensitive equipment. Proper use of protective clothing and equipment, along with simply avoiding the contaminated area, aids greatly in chemical survivability. SPECIAL PURPOSE Fuel-air munitions and flamethrowers are considered special- purpose weapons. Fuel-air munitions disperse fuel into the atmosphere forming a fuel-air mixture that is detonated. The fuel is usually contained in a metal canister and is dispersed by detonation of a central burster charge carried within the canister. Upon proper dispersion, the fuel-air mixture is detonated. Peak pressures created within the detonated cloud reach 300 pounds per square inch (psi). Fuel-air munitions create large area loading on a structure as compared to localized loadings caused by an equal weight high explosive"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"_____________________________________________________________________FM 5-103 3-11 charge. High temperatures ignite flammable materials. Flamethrowers and napalm produce intense heat and noxious gases which can neutralize accessible positions. The intense flame may also exhaust the oxygen content of inside air causing respiratory injuries to occupants shielded from the flaming fuel. Flame is effective in penetrating protective positions. Survivability Considerations Survivability of special purpose weapons effects includes covered positions with relatively small apertures and closable entrance areas which provide protection from napalm and flamethrowers. Deep-supported tunnels and positions provide protection from other fuel-air munitions and explosives. CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS Before designing fighting and protective positions, it is important to know how the previously-described weapons affect and interact with various materials that are fired upon. The materials used in fighting and protective position construction act as either shielding for the protected equipment and personnel, structural components to hold the shielding in place, or both. SHIELDING MATERIALS Shielding provides protection against penetration of both projectiles and fragments, nuclear and thermal radiation, and the effects of fire and chemical agents. Various materials and amounts of materials provide varying degrees of shielding. Some of the more commonly used materials and the effects of both projectile and fragment penetration in these materials, as well as nuclear and thermal radiation suppression, are discussed in the following paragraphs. (Incendiary and chemical effects are generalized from the previous discussion of weapons effects.) The following three tables contain shielding requirements of various materials to protect against direct hits by direct fire projectiles, direct fire high explosive (HE) shaped charges, and indirect fire fragmentation and blast . The table below lists nuclear protection factors associated with earth cover and sandbags."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"FM 5-103 _____________________________________________________________________ 3-12 "},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"_____________________________________________________________________FM 5-103 3-13 "},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"FM 5-103 _____________________________________________________________________ 3-14 Soil Direct fire and indirect fire fragmentation penetration in soil or other similar granular material is based on three considerations: for materials of the same density, the finer the grain the greater the penetration; penetration decreases with increase in density; and penetration increases with increasing water content. Nuclear and thermal radiation protection of soil is governed by the following: • The more earth cover, the better the shielding. Each layer of sandbags filled with sand or clay reduces transmitted radiation by 50 percent. • Sand or compacted clay provides better radiation shielding than other soils which are less dense. • Damp or wet earth or sand provides better protection than dry material. • Sandbags protected by a top layer of earth survive thermal radiation better than exposed bags. Exposed bags may burn, spill their contents, and become susceptible to the blast wave. Steel Steel is the most commonly used material for protection against direct and indirect fire fragmentation. Steel is also more likely to deform a projectile as it penetrates, and is much less likely to span than concrete. Steel plates, only 1/6 the thickness of concrete, afford equal protection against nondeforming projectiles of small and intermediate calibers. Because of its"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"_____________________________________________________________________FM 5-103 3-15 high density, steel is five times more effective in initial radiation suppression than an equal thickness of concrete. It is also effective against thermal radiation, although it transmits heat rapidly. Many field expedient types of steel are usable for shielding. Steel landing mats, culvert sections, and steel drums, for example, are effectively used in a structure as one of several composite materials. Expedient steel pieces are also used for individual protection against projectile and fragment penetration and nuclear radiation. Concrete When reinforcing steel is used in concrete, direct and indirect fire fragmentation protection is excellent. The reinforcing helps the concrete to remain intact even after excessive cracking caused by penetration. When a near miss shell explodes, its fragments travel faster than its blast wave. If these fragments strike the exposed concrete surfaces of a protective position, they can weaken the concrete to such an extent that the blast wave destroys it. When possible, at least one layer of sandbags, placed on their short ends, or 15 inches of soil should cover all exposed concrete surfaces. An additional consequence of concrete penetration is spalling. If a projectile partially penetrates concrete shielding, particles and chunks of concrete often break or scab off the back of the shield at the time of impact. These particles can kill when broken loose. Concrete provides excellent protection against nuclear and thermal radiation. Rock Direct and indirect fire fragmentation penetration into rock depends on the rock's physical properties and the number of joints, fractures, and other irregularities contained in the rock. These irregularities weaken rock and can increase penetration. Several layers of irregularly-shaped rock can change the angle of penetration. Hard rock can cause a projectile or fragment to flatten out or break up and stop penetration. Nuclear and thermal radiation protection is limited because of undetectable voids and cracks in rocks. Generally, rock is not as effective against radiation as concrete, since the ability to provide protection depends on the rock's density. Brick and Masonry Direct and indirect fire fragmentation penetration into brick and masonry have the same protection limitations as rock."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"FM 5-103 _____________________________________________________________________ 3-16 Nuclear and thermal radiation protection by brick and masonry is 1.5 times more effective than the protection afforded by soil. This characteristic is due to the higher compressive strength and hardness properties of brick and masonry. However, since density determines the degree of protection against initial radiation, unreinforced brick and masonry are not as good as concrete for penetration protection. Snow and Ice Although snow and ice are sometimes the only available materials in certain locations, they are used for shielding only. Weather could cause structures made of snow or ice to wear away or even collapse. Shielding composed of frozen materials provides protection from initial radiation, but melts if thermal radiation effects are strong enough. Wood Direct and indirect fire fragmentation protection using wood is limited because of its low density and relatively low compressive strengths. Greater thicknesses of wood than of soil are needed for protection from penetration. Wood is generally used as structural support for a survivability position. The low density of wood provides poor protection from nuclear and thermal radiation. Also, with its low ignition point, wood is easily destroyed by fire from thermal radiation. Other Materials Expedient materials include steel pickets, landing mats, steel culverts, steel drums, and steel shipping consolidated express (CONEX) containers. Chapter 4 discusses fighting and protective positions constructed with some of these materials. STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS The structure of a fighting and protective position depends on the weapon or weapon effect it is designed to defeat. All fighting and protective positions have some configuration of floor, walls, and roof designed to protect material and/or occupants. The floor, walls, and roof support the shielding discussed earlier, or may in themselves make up that shielding. These components must also resist blast and ground shock effects from detonation of high explosive rounds which place greater stress on the structure than the weight of the components and the shielding. Designers must make structural components of the"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"_____________________________________________________________________FM 5-103 3-17 positions stronger, larger, and/or more numerous in order to defeat blast and ground shock. Following is a discussion of materials used to build floors, walls, and roofs of positions. Floors Fighting and protective position floors are made from almost any material, but require resistance to weathering, wear, and trafficability. Soil is most often used, yet is least resistant to water damage and rutting from foot and vehicle traffic. Wood pallets, or other field-available materials are often cut to fit floor areas. Drainage sumps, shown below, or drains are also installed when possible. Walls Walls of fighting and protective positions are of two basic types-below ground (earth or revetted earth) and aboveground. Below ground walls are made of the in-place soil remaining after excavation of the position. This soil may need revetment or support, depending on the soil properties and depth of cut. When used to support roof structures, earth walls must support the roof at points no less than one fourth the depth of cutout from the edges of excavation, as shown."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"FM 5-103 _____________________________________________________________________ 3-18 Aboveground walls are normally constructed for shielding from direct fire and fragments. They are usually built of revetted earth, sandbags, concrete, or other materials. When constructed to a thickness adequate for shielding from direct fire and fragments, they are thick and stable enough for roof support. Additional details on wall design are given in FM 5-35. Roofs Roofs of fighting and protective positions are easily designed to support earth cover for shielding from fragments and small caliber direct fire. However, contact burst protection requires much stronger roof structures and, therefore, careful design. Roofs for support of earth cover shielding are constructed of almost any material that is usually used as beams or stringers and sheathing. The first two tables present guidelines for wooden roof structures (for fragment shielding only). A third table is converting dimensioned to round timber.

The table on defeat contact bursts gives basic design criteria for a roof. Appendix B of this manual describes a procedure for overhead cover design to defeat contact burst of high explosive projectiles. POSITION CATEGORIES Seven categories of fighting and protective positions or components of positions that are used together or separately are- • Holes and simple excavations. • Trenches. • Tunnels."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"_____________________________________________________________________FM 5-103 3-21 • Earth parapets. • Overhead cover and roof structures. • Triggering screens. • Shelters and bunkers. HOLES AND SIMPLE EXCAVATIONS Excavations, when feasible, provide good protection from direct fire and some indirect fire weapons effects. Open excavations have the advantages of- • Providing good protection from direct fire when the occupant would otherwise be exposed. • Permitting 360-degree observation and fire. • Providing good protection from nuclear weapons effects. Open excavations have the disadvantages of- • Providing limited protection from direct fire while the occupant is firing a weapon, since frontal and side protection is negligible. • Providing relatively no protection from fragments from overhead bursts of artillery shells. The larger the open excavation, the less the protection from artillery. • Providing limited protection from chemical effects. In some cases, chemicals concentrate in low holes and excavations. TRENCHES Trenches provide essentially the same protection from conventional, nuclear, and chemical effects as the other excavations described, and are used almost exclusively in defensive areas. They are employed as protective positions and used to connect individual holes, weapons positions, and shelters. They provide protection and concealment for personnel moving between fighting positions or in and out of the area. They are usually open excavations, but sections are sometimes covered to provide additional protection. Trenches are difficult to camouflage and are easily detected from the air. Trenches, like other positions, are developed progressively. As a general rule, they are excavated deeper than fighting positions to allow movement without exposure to enemy fire. It is usually necessary to provide revetment and drainage for them. TUNNELS"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"FM 5-103 _____________________________________________________________________ 3-22 Tunnels are not frequently constructed in the defense of an area due to the time, effort, and technicalities involved. However, they are usually used to good advantage when the length of time an area is defended justifies the effort, and the ground lends itself to this purpose. The decision to build tunnels also depends greatly on the nature of the soil, which is usually determined by borings or similar means. Tunneling in hard rock is slow and generally impractical. Tunnels in clay or other soft soils are also impractical since builders must line them throughout to prevent collapse. Therefore, construction of tunneled defenses is usually limited to hilly terrain, steep hillsides, and favorable soils including hard chalk, soft sandstone, and other types of hard soil or soft rock. In the tunnel system shown, the soil was generally very hard and only the entrances were timbered. The speed of excavation using hand tools varied according to the soil, and seldom exceeded 25 feet per day. In patches of hard rock, as little as 3 feet were excavated per day. Use of power tools did not significantly increase the speed of excavation. Engineer units, assisted by infantry personnel, performed the work. Tunnels of the type shown are excavated up to 30 feet below ground level. They are usually horizontal or nearly so. Entrances are strengthened against collapse under shell fire and ground shock from nuclear weapons. The first 16½ feet from each entrance should have frames using 4 by 4s or larger timber supports."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"_____________________________________________________________________FM 5-103 3-23 Untimbered tunnels are generally 31½ feet wide and 5 to 6 1/2 feet high. Once beyond the portal or entrance, tunnels of up to this size are unlimbered if they are deep enough and the soil will stand open. Larger tunnels must have shoring. Chambers constructed in rock or extremely hard soil do not need timber supports. If timber is not used, the chamber is not wider than 6½ feet; if timbers are used, the width can increase to 10 feet. The chamber is generally the same height as the tunnel, and up to 13 feet long. Grenade traps are constructed at the bottom of straight lengths where they slope. This is done by cutting a recess about 3½ feet deep in the wall facing the inclining floor of the tunnel. Much of the spoil from the excavated area requires disposal and concealment. The volume of spoil is usually estimated as one third greater than the volume of the tunnel. Tunnel entrances need concealment from enemy observation. Also, it is sometimes necessary during construction to transport spoil by hand through a trench. In cold regions, air warmer than outside air may rise from a tunnel entrance thus revealing the position."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"FM 5-103 _____________________________________________________________________ 3-24 The danger that tunnel entrances may become blocked and trap the occupants always exists. Picks and shovels are placed in each tunnel so that trapped personnel can dig their way out. Furthermore, at least two entrances are necessary for ventilation. Whenever possible, one or more emergency exits are provided. These are usually small tunnels with entrances normally closed or concealed. A tunnel is constructed from inside the system to within a few feet of the surface so that an easy breakthrough is possible. EARTH PARAPETS Excavations and trenches are usually modified to include front, rear, and side earth parapets. Parapets are constructed using spoil from the excavation or other materials carried to the site. Frontal, side, and rear parapets greatly increase the protection of occupants firing their weapons. Thicknesses required for parapets vary according to the material's ability to deny round penetration. Parapets are generally positioned as shown below to allow full frontal protection, thus relying on mutual support of other firing positions. Parapets are also used as a single means of protection, even in the absence of excavations. OVERHEAD COVER AND ROOF STRUCTURES Fighting and protective positions are given overhead cover primarily to defeat indirect fire projectiles landing on or exploding above them.

Overhead Burst (Fragments) Protection against fragments from airburst artillery is provided by a thickness of shielding required to defeat a certain size shell fragment, supported by a roof structure adequate for the dead load of the shielding. This type of roof structure is designed using the thicknesses to defeat fragment penetration given in the table on Indirect Fire Fragmentation and Blast. As a general guide, fragment penetration protection always requires at least 11/2 feet of soil cover. For example, to defeat fragments from a 120-mm mortar when available cover material is sandbags filled with soil, the cover depth required is 1½ feet. Then, the Maximum Span table shows that support of the l½ feet of cover (using 2 by 4 roof stringers over a 4-foot span) requires 16-inch center-to-center spacing of the 2 by 4s. This example is shown below. Contact Burst Protection from contact burst of indirect fire HE shells requires much more cover and roof structure support than does protection from fragmentation. The type of roof structure necessary is given in the following table. For example, if a position must defeat the contact burst of an 82-mm mortar, the table provides multiple design options. If 4 by 4 stringers are positioned on 9-inch center-to-center spacings over a span of 8 feet, then 2 feet of soil (loose, gravelly sand) is required to defeat the burst.

Defeating Super-Quick Fuzes Incoming shells with super-quick fuzes are defeated at a standoff distance with several types of triggering screen materials. The first table below lists thicknesses of facing material required for detonating incoming shells when impacting with the triggering screen.

The figure below shows this added delay fuse protection on top of the contact burst protection designed in appendix B. The rocks are placed in at least three layers on top of the required depth of cover for the expected shell size. The rock size is approximately twice the caliber of the expected shell.

However, some are prefabricated and transported forward to the battle area by trucks or air. If shelters and bunkers are properly constructed with appropriate collective protection equipment, they can serve as protection against chemical and biological agents. CONSTRUCTION METHODS"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"FM 5-103 _____________________________________________________________________ 3-32 For individual and crew-served weapons fighting and protective position construction, hand tools are available. The individual soldier carries an entrenching tool and has access to picks, shovels, machetes, and hand carpentry tools for use in individual excavation an d vertical construction work. Earthmoving equipment and explosives are used for excavating protective positions for vehicles and supplies. Earthmoving equipment, including backhoes, bulldozers, and bucket loaders, are usually used for larger or more rapid excavation when the situation permits. Usually, these machines cannot dig out the exact shape desired or dig the amount of earth necessary. The excavation is usually then completed by hand. Descriptions and capabilities of US survivability equipment are given in appendix A. Methods of construction include sandbagging, explosive excavation, and excavation revetments. SANDBAGGING Walls of fighting and protective positions are built of sandbags in much the same way bricks are used. Sandbags are also useful for retaining wall revetments as shown on the right. The sandbag is made of an acrylic fabric and is rot and weather resistant. Under all climatic conditions, the bag has a life of at least 2 years with no visible deterioration. (Some older- style cotton bags deteriorate much sooner.) The useful life of sandbags is prolonged by filling them with a mixture of dry earth and portland cement, normally in the ratio of 1 part of cement to 10 parts of dry earth. The cement sets as the bags take on moisture. A 1:6 ratio is used for sand-gravel mixtures. As an alternative, filled bags are dipped in a cement-water"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"_____________________________________________________________________FM 5-103 3-33 slurry. Each sandbag is then pounded with a flat object, such as a 2 by 4, to make the retaining wall more stable. As a rule, sandbags are used for revetting walls or repairing trenches when the soil is very loose and requires a retaining wall. A sandbag revetment will not stand with a vertical face. The face must have a slope of 1:4, and lean against the earth it is to hold in place. The base for the revetment must stand on firm ground and dug at a slope of 4:1. The following steps are used to construct a sandbag revetment wall such as the one shown. • The bags are filled about three-fourths full with earth or a dry soil-cement mixture and the choke cords are tied. • The bottom corners of the bags are tucked in after filling. • The bottom row of the revetment is constructed by placing all bags as headers. The wall is built using alternate rows of stretchers and headers with the joints broken between courses. The top row of the revetment wall consists of headers. • Sandbags are positioned so that the planes between the layers have the same pitch as the base-at right angles to the slope of the revetment. • All bags are placed so that side seams on stretchers and choked ends on headers are turned toward the revetted face. • As the revetment is built, it is backfilled to shape the revetted face to this slope."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"FM 5-103 _____________________________________________________________________ 3-34 Often, the requirement for filled sandbags far exceeds the capabilities of soldiers using only shovels. If the bags are filled from a stockpile, the job is performed easier and faster by using a lumber or steel funnel as shown on the right. EXPLOSIVE EXCAVATION Explosive excavation is done by placing charges in boreholes in a particular pattern designed to excavate a certain dimensioned hole. Boreholes are dug to a depth two thirds that of desired excavation. The holes are spaced no farther apart than twice their depth, and no closer to the desired perimeter than the depth of the borehole. The boreholes are dug with posthole diggers, hand augers, or with 15-or 40-pound shaped charges. The holes are backfilled and tamped. Borehole sizes made with shaped charges are listed in the first table below. Boreholes made with shaped charges may need additional digging or partial filling and tamping to achieve a desired depth. When setting explosives, the charges are placed in the borehole with two thirds of the charge at the bottom and one third halfway down. The charges are then tamped. The second table below lists the pounds of explosive needed in a sandy clay soil per depth of borehole. Because soil type and explosive effectiveness vary, the quantity of explosive required may differ slightly from the amounts given in the previous table. A test hole is detonated to check the accuracy of the table in the specific soil condition.

Information concerning the calculation of charge weights and the use of prime cord or blasting caps is contained in FM 5-34 and FM 5-25. To create ramps for positions in relatively flat terrain using explosives, the lower portion is excavated as a rectangular position, as shown, and the upper end is excavated by hand. Charges are not placed closer than the borehole depth from the desired edge, and not farther than twice the borehole depth apart. Portions of the position less than 2 feet deep are usually excavated by hand."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"FM 5-103 _____________________________________________________________________ 3-36 Circular Positions"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"_____________________________________________________________________FM 5-103 3-37 Circular positions are prep ared with a circular arrangement of boreholes surrounding a borehole at the center of the position. Several concentric rings of holes are needed for large positions, and one ring or only one charge for small positions. The charge layout shown on the right is as follows: • The radius of the desired circular position is determined. • The borehole depth is subtracted from the radius and a circle is inscribed on the ground with the new radius length. • The new radius length is divided by twice the borehole depth to determine the number of rings within the position. • Each additional ring is positioned at equal distances between the outer ring and the center of the position. • Boreholes are spaced equal distance along each ring. Each hole should not exceed twice the borehole depth from another hole on the ring. • The charge weight is doubled in all holes in the interior rings. When the position diameter does not exceed twice the borehole depth, a single charge placed at the center of the position is enough. When the position diameter is between two and four times the borehole depth, space three holes equal distance around the ring and omit the center hole. Positions in Frozen Soil"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"FM 5-103 _____________________________________________________________________ 3-38 In frozen soil, blasting requires about 1.5 to 2 times the number of boreholes and larger charges than those calculated for moderate climates. To determine the number of bore-holes needed, testing is performed before extensive excavation is attempted. For frozen soil, hole depth (d) should equal required depth of excavation. The required charge weight (w) is w = 0.06 d 3 pounds, where (d) is in feet. Positions in Rocky Soil Boulders and rocks are removed by using blasting methods described in FM 5-25 or FM 5-34.These manuals also described similar activities for stump and tree root removal. EXCAVATION REVETMENTS Excavations in soil may require revetment to prevent side walls from collapsing. Several methods of excavation revetments are usually used to prevent wall collapse. Wall Sloping The need for revetment is sometimes avoided or postponed by sloping the walls of the excavation. In most soils, a slope of 1:3 or 1:4 is sufficient. This method is used temporarily if the soil is loose and no revetting materials are available. The ratio of 1:3, for example, will determine the slope by moving 1 foot horizontally for each 3 feet vertically. When wall sloping is used, the walls are first dug vertically and then sloped. Facing Revetments Facing revetments serve mainly to protect revetted surfaces from the effects of weather and occupation. It is used when soils are stable enough to sustain their own weight. This revetment consists of the revetting or facing material and the supports which hold the revetting material in place. The facing material is usually much thinner than that used in a retaining wall. Facing revetments are preferable to wall sloping since less excavation is required. The top of the facing is set below ground level. The facing is constructed of brushwood hurdles, continuous brush, poles, corrugated metal, plywood, or burlap and chicken wire. The following paragraphs describe the method of constructing each type. Brushwood Hurdle. A brushwood hurdle is a woven revetment unit usually 6½ feet long and as high as the revetted wall. Pieces of"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"_____________________________________________________________________FM 5-103 3-39 brushwood about 1 inch in diameter are weaved on a framework of sharpened pickets driven into the ground at 20-inch intervals. When completed, the 6 ½-foot lengths are carried to the position where the pickets are driven in place. The tops of the pickets are tied back to stakes or holdfasts and the ends of the hurdles are wired together. Continuous Brush. A continuous brush revetment is constructed in place. Sharpened pickets 3 inches in diameter are driven into the bottom of the trench at 30-inch intervals and about 4 inches from the revetted earth face. The space behind the pickets is packed with small, straight brushwood laid horizontally. The tops of the pickets are anchored to stakes or holdfasts."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"FM 5-103 _____________________________________________________________________ 3-40 Pole. A pole revetment is similar to the continuous brush revetment except that a layer of small horizontal round poles, cut to the length of the revetted wall, is used instead of brushwood. If available, boards or planks are used instead of poles because of quick installation. Pickets are held in place by holdfasts or struts."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"_____________________________________________________________________FM 5-103 3-41 Corrugated Metal Sheets or Plywood. A revetment of corrugated metal sheets or plywood is usually installed rapidly and is strong and durable. It is well adapted to position construction because the edges and ends of sheets or planks are lapped, as required, to produce a revetment of a given height and length. All metal surfaces are smeared with mud to reduce possible reflection of thermal radiation and aid in camouflage. Burlap and chicken wire revetments are similar to revetments made from corrugated metal sheets or plywood. However, burlap and chicken wire does not have the strength or durability of plywood or sheet metal in supporting soil.

Frames of dimensioned timber are constructed to fit the bottom and sides of the position and hold the facing material apart over the excavated width. "},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"_____________________________________________________________________FM 5-103 3-43 Pickets are driven into the ground on the position side of the facing material. The pickets are held tightly against the facing by bracing them apart across the width of the position. The size of pickets required and their spacing are determined by the soil and type of facing material used. Wooden pickets smaller than 3 inches in diameter are not used. The maximum spacing between pickets is about 6½ feet. The standard pickets used to support barbed wire entanglements are excellent for use in revetting. Pickets are driven at least 1½ feet into the floor of the position. Where the tops of the pickets are anchored, an anchor stake or holdfast is driveninto the top of the bank and tied to the top of the picket. The distance between the anchor stake and the facing is at least equal to the height of the revetted face, with alternate anchors staggered and at least 2 feet farther back. Several strands of wire holding the pickets against the emplacement walls are placed straight and taut. A groove or channel is cut in the parapet to pass the wire through. SPECIAL CONSTRUCTION CONSIDERATIONS CAMOUFLAGE AND CONCEALMENT The easiest and most efficient method of preventing the targeting and destruction of a position or shelter is use of proper camouflage and concealment techniques. Major"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"FM 5-103 _____________________________________________________________________ 3-44 considerations for camouflage use are discussed in appendix D. Following are some general guidelines for position construction. Natural concealment and good camouflage materials are used. When construction of a positions begins, natural materials such as vegetation, rotting leaves, scrub brush, and snow are preserved for use as camouflage when construction is completed. If explosive excavation is used, the large area of earth spray created by detonation is camouflaged or removed by first placing tarpaulins or scrap canvas on the ground prior to charge detonation. Also, heavy equipment tracks and impressions are disguised upon completion of construction. Fields of fire are not overcleared. In fighting position construction, clearing of fields of fire is an important activity for effective engagement of the enemy. Excessive clearing is prevented in order to reduce early enemy acquisition of the position. Procedures for clearing allow for only as much terrain modification as is needed for enemy acquisition and engagement. Concealment from aircraft is provided. Consideration is usually given to observation from the air. Action is taken to camouflage position interiors or roofs with fresh natural materials, thus preventing contrast with the surroundings. During construction, the position is evaluated from the enemy side. By far, the most effective means of evaluating concealment and camouflage is to check it from a suspected enemy avenue of approach. DRAINAGE Positions and shelters are designed to take advantage of the natural drainage pattern of the ground. They are constructed to provide for- • Exclusion of surface runoff. • Disposal of direct rainfall or seepage. • Bypassing or rerouting natural drainage channels if they are intersected by the position. In addition to using materials that are durable and resistant to weathering and rot, positions are protected from damage due to surface runoff and direct rainfall, and are repaired quickly when erosion begins. Proper position siting can lessen the problem of surface water runoff. Surface water is excluded by"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"_____________________________________________________________________FM 5-103 3-45 excavating intercepted ditches uphill from a position or shelter. Preventing water from flowing into the excavation is easier than removing it. Positions are located to direct the runoff water into natural drainage lines. Water within a position or shelter is carried to central points by constructing longitudinal slopes in the bottom of the excavation. A very gradual slope of 1 percent is desirable. MAINTENANCE If water is allowed to stand in the bottom of an excavation, the position is eventually undermined and becomes useless. Sumps and drains are kept clean of silt and refuse. Parapets around positions are kept clear and wide enough to prevent parapet soil from falling into the excavation. When wire and pickets are used to support revetment material, the pickets may become loose, especially after rain. Improvised braces are wedged across the excavation, at or near floor level, between two opposite pickets. Anchor wires are tightened by further twisting. Anchor pickets are driven in farther to hold tightened wires. Periodic inspections of sandbags are made. REPAIRS If the walls are crumbling in at the top of an excavation (ground level), soil is cut out where it is crumbling (or until firm soil is reached). Sandbags or sod blocks are used to build up the damaged area. If excavation walls are wearing away at the floor level, a plank is placed on its edge or the brushwood is shifted down. The plank is held against the excavation wall with short pickets driven into the floor. If planks are used on both sides of the excavation, a wedge is placed between the planks and earth is placed in the back of the planks. If an entire wall appears ready to collapse, the excavation is completely revetted. "},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"FM 5-103 _____________________________________________________________________ 3-46 SECURITY In almost all instances, fighting and protective positions are prepared by teams of at least two personnel.

In offensive combat operations, weapons are sited wherever natural or existing positions are available, or where weapon emplacement is made with minimal digging. COVER Positions are designed to defeat an anticipated threat. Protection agai nst direct and indirect fire is of primary concern for position design. However, the effects of nuclear a nd chemical attack are taken into consideration if their use is suspecte d. Protection design for one type of enemy fire is not necessarily effective against another. The fo llowing three types of cover-frontal, overhead, and flank and rear-will have a direct b earing on designing and constructing positions. Frontal"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"FM 5-103 _____________________________________________________________________ 4-2 Frontal cover provides protection from small caliber direct fire. Natural frontal protection such as large trees, rocks, logs , and rubble is best because enemy detection of fighting positions becomes difficult. However, if natural frontal protection is not adequate for proper protection, dirt excavated from the position (hole) is used. Frontal cover requires the position to have the co rrect length so that soldiers have adequate room; the correct dirt thickness (3 feet) to stop enemy small caliber fire; the correct height for overhead protection; and, for soldiers firing to the oblique, the corr ect frontal distance for elbow rests and sector stakes. Protection from larger direct fire weapons (for exam ple, tank guns) is achieved by locating the position where the enemy cannot engage it, and concealing it so pinpoint location is not possible. Almost twice as many soldiers are killed or wounded by small caliber fire when their positions do not ha ve frontal cover. Overhead Overhead cover provides protection from indirect fire fragmentation. When possible, overhead cover is always constructed to enhance protection against airburst artille ry shells. Overhead cover is n ecessary because soldiers are at least ten times more protected from indirect fire if they are in a hole with overhead cover. Flank and Rear Flank and rear cover ensures complete protection for fighting position. Flank and rear cover protects soldiers against the effects of indirect fire bursts to the flanks or rear of the position, and the effect s of friendly weapons located in the rear (for example, packing from discarded sabot rounds fi red from tanks). Ideally, this protection is provided by natural cover. In its absence, a pa rapet is constructed as time and circumstances permit. SIMPLICITY AND ECONOMY The position is usually uncomplicated and strong, requires as little digging as possible, and is constructed of immediatel y-available materials. INGENUITY A high degree of imagination is es sential to assure the best use of available materials. Many different materials existing on the battlefield and prefab ricated materials found in industrial and urban areas can be used for position construction. PROGRESSIVE DEVELOPMENT Positions should allow for progressive development to insure flexibility, security, and protection in depth. Hasty positions are co ntinuously improved into deli berate positions to provide maximum protection from enemy fire. Trenches or tunnels connecting fighting positions give ultimate flexibility in fighting from a battle pos ition or strongpoint. Grenade sumps are usually dug at the bottom of a position's front wall where water collects. The sump is about 3 feet long,"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"_____________________________________________________________________FM 5-103 4-3 ½ foot wide, and dug at a 30-degree angle. The slant of the floor cha nnels excess water and grenades into the sump. In la rger positions, separate drainage sumps or water drains are constructed to reduce the amount of water collecting at the bottom of the position. CAMOUFLAGE AND CONCEALMENT Camouflage and concealment activities are con tinual during position sitin g preparation. If the enemy cannot locate a fighting position, then the pos ition offers friendly forces the advantage of firing first before being detected.

Priority is given to those vehicles containing essential mission-oriented e quipment or supplies. Drivers and crews should use these fighting positions for individual protection also. Parapets positioned at the front of or ar ound major weapons systems will provide improved protection from direct fire and from blast and fragments of in direct fire artillery, mortar, and rocket shells.

Further, the parapet"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"_____________________________________________________________________FM 5-103 4-13 functions as a standoff barrier for impact-detona ting direct fire HEAT and ATGM projectiles. The parapet should cause the fuzes to activate, th ereby increasing survivab ility for the protected vehicles. If the expected enemy uses kinetic en ergy direct fire armor piercing or hypervelocity projectiles, it is impossible to construct parape ts thick enough for protection. To protect against these projectiles, deep-cut, hull defilade, or turret defilade positi ons are prepared. The dimensions for fighting and protec tive positions for essential vehi cles are constructed no larger than operationally necessary. FIGHTING POSITIONS Success on the battlefield requires maneuver among fighting positions between main gun firings. Maximum use of wadis, reversed slope hills, and natural concealment is required to conceal fighting vehicles maneuvering among fighting positions. After a major weapon system fires its main gun, the vehicle and gun usually must maneuve r concealed to another position before firing again. If the major weapon system immediately reappears in the old position, the enemy will know where to fire their next round. The tabl e summarizes dimensions of the hasty and deliberate vehicle positions discussed in the fo llowing paragraphs. Cons truction planning factors for vehicle fighting positions are shown in the table. "},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"FM 5-103 _____________________________________________________________________ 4-14 Hasty Positions Hasty fighting positions for combat vehicles including armored personnel carriers (APCs), combat engineering vehicles (CEVs), and mortar carriers take advantage of natural terrain features or are prepared with a minimum of c onstruction effort. A frontal parapet, as high as practical without interfering with the vehicles' weapon systems, sh ields from frontal attack and provides limited concealment if properly camoufla ged. Protection is improved if the position is made deeper and the parapet extended around the ve hicle's sides. Because of the false sense of security provided by parapets against kinetic en ergy and hypervelocity proj ectiles, hasty vehicle fighting positions with parapets are not recomm ended for tanks, infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs), and improved TOW vehicles (ITVs). Ha sty fighting positions do offer protection from HEAT projectiles and provide limited concealme nt if properly camouflaged. As the tactical situation permits, hasty positions are improved to deliberate positions. Deliberate Positions Deliberate fighting positions are re quired to protect a vehicle fr om kinetic energy hypervelocity projectiles. The position is constructed in four parts: hull defilade, c oncealed access ramp or route, hide location, and turret defilade. Positions formed by natural terrain are best because of easy modification; however, if preparation is ne cessary, extensive engine er support is required. Each position is camouflaged with either natural vegetation or a cam ouflage net, and the spoil is flattened out or hauled away. All fighting positions for fighting vehicles (tanks, IFVs, ITVs) are planned as deliberate positions. Since the lack of time usually does not allow the full construction of a deliberate positi on, then only some parts of the position's construction are prepared. For example, the complete fighting pos ition for a tank requires the construction of a hull defilade, turret defilade, concealed access ramp or route, and hide location all within the same fighting position.

As a general rule, deeper excavation is desired for other than fighting trenches to provide more protection or allow more headroom. Some trenches may also require widening to accomm odate more traffic, incl uding stretchers. It is usually necessary to revet trenches that are more than 5 feet deep in any type of soil. In the deeper trenches, some engineer advice or assist ance is usually necessary in providing adequate drainage. Two basic trenches are the crawl trench and the standard fighting trench."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"FM 5-103 _____________________________________________________________________ 4-20 Each trench is constructed to th e length required and follows either an octagonal or zigzag trace pattern.

These units are required to deploy and remain in one location for a considerable amount of time to perform their mission. Thus, they may require substantial protective construction. FORWARD LOGISTICS Forward logistics are subdivided into the followi ng areas normally found in the brigade trains area of a mechanized division: • Field trains (elements of mane uver battalions and companies). • Forward supply points. • Forward support maintenance. • Medical stations. • Battalion aid stations. • Miscellaneous activities. Field Trains Shelters described in the next section (Special Designs) are adequate for general supply storage. In practice, most of the supplies remain on organic trucks and traile rs in forward areas so trains can responsively move to support combat for ces. They are protected by deep-cut vehicle positions or walls. "},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"FM 5-103 _____________________________________________________________________ 4-22 Forward Supply Points Petroleum, oils, and lubricants (POL) products are a critical supply category in mechanized operations. Tanker trucks of th e supply points are protected by natural berms or deep-cut protective positions. Overhead cover is impractical for short periods of occupancy, but maximum use is made of camouflage nets and natural terrain concealment. Class I, II, and IV supplies not kept in vehicles are placed in deep-cut trenches when time perm its, but are of low priority for protection since even a direct hit on unprotecte d items may not completely destroy stocks. Forward Support Maintenance In a highly fluid battle situation where frequent displacement of the forward support company is required, the company cannot afford the effort required to construct extensive protective positions and shelters due to conflicts with ba sic mission accomplishment. Further, the company base of operations is close to the brigade trains area which is relatively secure from overt ground attack. Also, a large portion of the company is habitually employed away from the company area providing contact teams to supporte d units. Thus, the basic protect ion requirements are simple positions for individuals and crew-served weapons. The specific number of positions is determined by the size of the company position perimeter and the number of personnel and crew- served weapons available to protect the perime ter. In the principal company area, individual positions are constructed near their billeting area s and on the periphery of their work sections. Simple cut-and-cover or other expedient shelters are constructed next to principal shop facilities to provide immediate protection from artillery/ air attack. These shelters are usually not larger than 10-person shelters. Medical Stations The amount of equipment emplaced at a medical clearing station varies from mission to mission. Protection for a minimum of 40 patients is requir ed as soon as possible. Design and construction of shelters with adequate overhead cover is ma ndatory so medical care and treatment are not interrupted by hostile action. Enemy air activity may hinder prompt evacuation of patients from the clearing station; thus, adequate shelte r for both holding and treating patients becomes paramount. For planning purposes, shelters for pr otecting 20 personnel on lit ters or folding cots, and smaller shelters for surgery, X-ray, laboratory, dental, and tr iage functions are considered. The deliberate shelters are generally well-suited to these activities. Protection for personnel organic to medical companies is provide d by individual and crew-served weapons positions. When the situation permits, sh elters are constructed for sleeping or other activities. Ambulances and other vehicles also need protection. Vehicle protection is usually deep-cut type, with maximum advantage taken of protection offered by te rrain and vegetation. Battalion Aid Stations Battalion aid stations normally operate from a tracked vehicle situated behind natural terrain cover. As time and resources permit, this site is improved with overhead cover and parapets allowing vehicle access and egress. Although the patient-holding cap acity of the aid station is"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"_____________________________________________________________________FM 5-103 4-23 extremely limited, some permanent shelters are provided for patients held during periods when enemy activity interrupts evacuation. Miscellaneous Activities Miscellaneous activities include forward ar ming and refueling points (FARPs), water, decontamination, clothing exchange, and bath poi nts. In fast-moving combat situations where established supply points are too distant to provi de rapid fuel and ammunition service, FARPs are established. With the anticipated short time of intense operation of the FARP, personnel have little time for protective activities. Prefabricate d defensive walls provide the necessary protection within the short time available. The various activities involved in water, decontamination, clothing exchange, and bath points require protection for both customers and ope rating personnel. Equipment, such as power sources (generators), needs protec tion from indirect fire fragment ation and direct fire. Operating personnel need both individual fighting positions a nd protective positions. Many of the shelters described in the next sect ion (Special Designs) are ad apted for aboveground use in decontamination operations, clothi ng exchange, or bath points. ARTILLERY FIREBASES Artillery firebases are of extr eme tactical importance and re quire substantial protective construction. The most frequently constructed fi rebase houses are an infantry battalion command element, two infantry companies, a 105-mm how itzer battery, and three to six 155-mm howitzer batteries. A firebase housing the above units consis ts of the following facilities: infantry TOCs, artillery FDCs, ammunition storage positions, garbage dump, command and control helicopter pad, logistics storage area and sling-out pad, art illery firing positions, helicopter parking area and refuel point, and hardened sleeping protective positions. Firebases usually are surrounded by a protective parapet with perimete r fighting positions, two or more bands of tactical wire, hasty protective minefield, and a cleared buffer zone to provide adequate fields of fire for perimeter defense. (Field Manual 5-102 provides detailed info rmation on minefield.) If a local water source is available, an airportable water supply point is setup to provide water for the firebase and the units in the local area. Firebase construction is divided into three phases: combat assau lt and initial clearing (Phase I), immediate construction (Phase II), and final construction (Phase III). Dedicated engineer support is a requirement for the c onstruction of a firebase. Phase I Combat assault and initial clearing consists of securing the firebase site and clearing an area large enough to accommodate CH-47 and CH-54 helic opters if the site is inaccessible by ground vehicle. The time required to complete this phase de pends on the terrain at th e firebase site. If the site is free of trees and undergro wth, or if these obstacles were removed by artillery and tactical air fire preparation, combat engineers can move i mmediately to phase II af ter the initial combat assault on the site. If the site is covered with foliage and trees , the security force and combat"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"FM 5-103 _____________________________________________________________________ 4-24 engineers are required to descend into the site from hovering helicopters. Depending on the density of the foliage on the site , completion of the initial clea ring phase by combat engineers with demolitions and chain saws may take up to 3 hours. Phase II Immediate construction begins as soon as the cleared area can accommodate either ground vehicles or, if the site is in accessible by ground vehicle, medium or heavy lift helicopters. Two light airmobile dozers are lifted to the site and immediately clear brush and stumps to expand the perimeter and clear and level how itzer positions. Meanwhile, the co mbat engineers continue to expand the perimeter with chain saws, demolitions , and bangalore torpedoes. If enough area is available, a heavy airmobile dozer is usually committed to clear a logistics storage area and sling-out pad, then expand the perimeter and fi elds of fire. The backhoes are committed to excavate protective positions for th e infantry TOC, artillery FDC, and, as soon as the perimeter trace is established, perimeter fighting positions. The immediate construction phase is characterized by the coordinated effort of infantry, artillery, and engineer forces to produce a tenable tact ical position by nightfa ll on the first day. A coordinated site plan and list of priorities for transportation and constr uction are prepared and constantly updated. Priorities a nd the site plan are establishe d by the tactical commander in coordination with the project engineer. As soon as a perimeter trace is set up and the site is capable of accep ting the logistics and artillery lifts, maxi mum effort is directed toward the defe nses of the firebase. Combat engineers and the heavy dozer continue to push back the unde rgrowth to permit adequate fields of fire. The two light airmobile dozers are co mmitted to constructing a 5 to 8 foot thick parapet around the perimeter to protect against direct fire. Infant ry troops are committed to constructing perimeter fighting positions at sites previously excavated by the backhoes. With the assistance of combat engineers, the infantry troops also begin placing the first band of tactical wire, usually triple standard concertina. Artillery troops not im mediately committed to fire missions prepare ammunition storage protective positions and parapets around each howitzer. Phase III Final construction begins when construction forces complete the immediate defensive structures. Combat engineers placing the tactical wire or cl earing fields of fire be gin construction of the infantry TOG and artillery FDC. Infantry a nd artillery troops are committed to placing the second band of tactical wire to building pers onnel sleeping protective positions with overhead cover. Phase III is usually a continuous pr ocess, involving constant improvement and maintenance. However, most protective struct ures, including sandbag pr otection of the TOC and personnel positions, usually are completed by the e nd of the fourth day. Time is the controlling parameter in construction of a firebase.

A strongpoint is a battle position fortified as stro ngly as possible within the time constraints to withstand direct assaults from ar mor and dismounted infantry. It is located on key terrain critical to the defense and controls an enemy main ave nue of approach. In some cases, the brigade or division commander may direct th at a strongpoint be emplaced by a battalion or company-sized unit. The strongpoint is essentially an antitank \"nest\" which tanks physic ally cannot overrun or bypass, and which enemy infantry reduces only with expenditure of much time and overwhelming forces. The strongpoint is the \"cork\" in a bottleneck formed by terrain, obstacles, units and preplanned fires. The strongpoint is si milar to a perimeter defense in that it is developed to defeat an attack from any direc tion. It is distinguished from other defensive positions by the importance of the terrain on which it is located and also by the time, effort, and resources spent to its development. A str ong-point is not setup on a routine basis. Survivability tasks necessary to develop a strongpoint are divided into developing positions in open areas and in urban or built -up areas. Critical survivabilit y tasks in open areas include preparation of- • ATGM positions. • Tank hull defilade positions as a minimum for primary, alternate, and supplementary positions. Turret defilade and hide positions are prepared as time allows. • Dug-in positions for command, aid st ations, and critical storage. • Covered routes between positions.

Shelters differ from fighting positions because there are usually no provisions for firing weapons from them. However, they are usually constructed near-or to supplement- fighting positions. When available, natural shelters such as caves, mines, or tunnels are used instead of constructing shelters. Engineers are co nsulted to determine su itability of caves and tunnels. The best shelter is usually one that pr ovides the most protection but requires the least amount of effort to construct. Shelters are fr equently prepared by support troops, troops making a temporary halt due to inclement weather, and unit s in bivouacs, assembly areas, and rest areas. Shelters are constructed with as much overhead cover as possible. They are dispersed and limited to a maximum capacity of about 25 soldiers. S upply shelters are of any size, depending on location, time, and materials available. Large sh elters require additiona l camouflaged entrances and exits. All three types of shelters-b elow ground, aboveground, and cut-a nd-cover-are usually sited on reverse slopes, in woods, or in some form of natural defilade such as ravines, valleys, wadis, and other hollows or depressions in th e terrain.

Protection provided by the walls is restricted to stopping fragment and blast effects from near- miss explosions of mortar, rocket, or artillery shells; some direct fire protection is also provided. Overhead cover is not practical due to the size of the position surrounded by the walls. In some cases, modification of the designs shown will increase nuclear protection.

The few natural or locally-procurable materials which are available in jungle areas are usually limited to camouflage use. Position construction materials are transported to these areas and are required to be weather and rot resistant. When shelters are constructed in jungles, primary consideration is given to drainage provisions. Because of high amounts of rainfall and poor soil drainage, positions are built to allow for good, natural drainage routes. This technique not only prevents flooded positions but, because of nuclear fallout washing down from trees and vegetation, it also prevents positions from becoming radiation hot spots. Other considerations are high water tables, dense undergrowth, and tree roots, often requiring above-ground level protective construction. A structure used in areas where groundwater is high, or where there is a low- pressure resistance soil, is the fighting position platform, depicted below. This platform provides a floating base or floor where wet or low pressure resistance soil precludes standing or sitting. The platform is constructed of small branches or timber layered over cross- posts, thus distributing the floor load over a wider area. As shown in the following illustrations, satisfactory rain shelters are quickly constructed using easily-procurable materials such as ponchos or natural materials. Field Manual 90-5 provides detailed information on jungle operations.

Because of rocky ground, it is difficult and often impossible to dig below ground positions; therefore, boulders and loose rocks are used in aboveground"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"FM 5-103_____________________________________________________________________ 5-4 construction. Irregular fields of fire and dead spaces are considered when designing and locating fighting positions in mountainous areas. Reverse slope positions are rarely used in mountainous terrain; crest and near-crest positions on high ground are much more common. Direct fire weapon positions in mountainous areas are usually poorly concealed by large fields of fire. Indirect fire weapon positions are better protected from both direct and indirect fire when located behind steep slopes and ridges. Another important design consideration in mountain terrain is the requirement for substantial overhead cover. The adverse effects of artillery bursts above a protective position are greatly enhanced by rock and gravel displacement or avalanche. Construction materials used for both structural and shielding components are most often indigenous rocks, boulders, and rocky soil. Often, rock formations are used as structural wall components without modification. Conventional tools are inadequate for preparing individual and crew-served weapons fighting positions in rocky terrain. Engineers assist with light equipment and tools (such as pneumatic jackhammers) delivered to mountain areas by helicopter. Explosives and demolitions are used extensively for positions requiring rock and boulder removal. Field Manual 90-6 provides detailed information on mountain operations. In areas with rocky soil or gravel, wire cages or gabions are used as building blocks in protective walls, structural walls, and fighting positions. Gabions are constructed of lumber, plywood, wire fence, or any suitable material that forms a stackable container for soil or gravel. The two-soldier mountain shelter is basically a hole 7 feet long, 3 ½ feet wide, and 3 ½ feet deep. The hole is covered with 6--to 8-inch diameter logs with evergreen branches, a shelter half, or local material such as topsoil, leaves, snow, and twigs placed on top. The floor is usually covered with evergreen twigs, a shelter half, or other expedient material. Entrances can be provided at both ends or a fire pit is sometimes dug at one end for a small fire or stove. A low earth parapet is built around the position to provide more height for the occupants. DESERTS Deserts are extensive, arid, arid treeless, having a severe lack of rainfall and extreme daily temperature fluctuations. The"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"_____________________________________________________________________FM 5-103 5-5 terrain is sandy with boulder-strewn areas, mountains, dunes, deeply-eroded valleys, areas of rock and shale, and salt marshes. Effective natural barriers are found in steep slope rock formations. Wadis and other dried up drainage features are used extensively for protective position placement. Designers of fighting and protective positions in desert areas must consider the lack of available natural cover and concealment. The only minimal cover available is through the use of terrain masking; therefore, positions are often completed above ground. Mountain and plateau deserts have rocky soil or \"surface chalk\" soil which makes digging difficult. In these areas, rocks and boulders are used for cover. Most often, parapets used in desert fighting or protective positions are undesirable because of probable enemy detection in the flat desert terrain. Deep-cut positions are also difficult to construct in soft sandy areas because of wall instability during excavations. Revetments are almost always required, unless excavations are very wide and have gently sloping sides of 45 degrees or less. Designing over-head cover is additionally important because nuclear explosions have increased fallout due to easily displaced sandy soil. Indigenous materials are usually used in desert position construction. However, prefabricated structures and revetments for excavations, if available, are ideal. Metal culvert revetments are quickly emplaced in easily excavated sand, Sandbags and sand-filled ammunition boxes are also used for containing backsliding soil. Therefore, camouflage and concealment, as well as light and noise discipline, are important considerations during position construction. Target acquisition and observation are relatively easy in desert terrain. Field Manual 90-3 provides detailed information on desert operations. COLD REGIONS Cold regions of the world are characterized by deep snow, permafrost, seasonally frozen ground, frozen lakes and rivers, glaciers, and long periods of extremely cold temperatures. Digging in frozen or semifrozen ground is difficult with equipment, and virtually impossible for the soldier with an entrenching tool. When possible, positions are designed to take advantage of below ground cover. Positions are dug as deep as possible, then built up. Fighting and protective position construction in snow or frozen ground takes up to twice as long as positions in unfrozen ground. Also, positions used in cold"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"FM 5-103_____________________________________________________________________ 5-6 regions are affected by wind and the possibility of thaw during warming periods. An unexpected thaw causes a severe drop in the soil strength which creates mud and drainage problems. Positions near bodies of water, such as lakes or rivers, are carefully located to prevent flooding damage during the spring melt season. Wind protection greatly decreases the effects of cold on both soldiers and equipment. The following areas offer good wind protection: • Densely wooded areas. • Groups of vegetation; small blocks of trees or shrubs. • The lee side of terrain elevations. (The protected zone extends horizontally up to three times the height of the terrain elevation). • Terrain depressions. The three basic construction materials available in cold region terrain are snow, ice, and frozen soil. Positions are more effective when constructed with these three materials in conjunction with timber, stone, or other locally-available materials. Snow Dry snow is less suitable for expedient construction than wet snow because it does not pack as well. Snow piled at road edges after clearing equipment has passed densifies and begins to harden within hours after disturbance, even at very low temperatures. Snow compacted artificially, by the wind, and after a brief thaw is even more suitable for expedient shelters and protective structures. A uniform snow cover with a minimum thickness of 10 inches is sufficient for shelter from the weather and for revetment construction. Blocks of uniform size, typically 8 by 12 by 16 inches, depending upon degree of hardness and density, are cut from the snow pack with shovels, long knives (machetes), or carpenter's saws. The best practices for constructing cold weather shelters are those adopted from natives of polar regions. The systematic overlapping block-over-seam method ensures stable construction. \"Caulking\" seams with loose snow ensures snug, draft-free structures. Igloo shelters in cold regions have been known to survive a whole winter. An Eskimo-style snow shelter, depicted below, easily withstands above-freezing inside temperatures, thus providing comfortable protection against wind chill and low temperatures. Snow positions are built during either freezing or thawing if the thaw is not so long or intense that significant snow melt conditions occur. Mild thaw of"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"_____________________________________________________________________FM 5-103 5-7 temperatures 1 or 2 degrees above freezing are more favorable than below-freezing temperatures because snow conglomerates readily and assumes any shape without disintegration. Below- freezing temperatures are also necessary for snow construction in order to achieve solid freezing and strength. If water is available at low temperatures, expedient protective structures are built by wetting down and shaping snow, with shovels, into the desired forms. Ice The initial projectile-stopping capability of ice is better than snow or frozen soil; however, under sustained fire, ice rapidly cracks and collapses. Ice structures are built in the following three ways: Layer-by-layer freezing by water. This method produces the strongest ice but, compared to the other two methods, is more time consuming. Protective surfaces are formed by spraying water in a fine mist on a structure or fabric. The most favorable temperature for this method is--10 to --15 degrees Celsius with a moderate wind. Approximately 2 to 3 inches of ice are formed per day between these temperatures (1/5-inch of ice per degree below zero). "},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"FM 5-103_____________________________________________________________________ 5-8 Freezing ice fragments into layers by adding water. This method is very effective and the most frequently used for building ice structures. The ice fragments are about 1-inch thick and prepared on nearby plots or on the nearest river or water reservoir. The fragments are packed as densely as possible into a layer 8 to 12 inches thick. Water is then sprayed over the layers of ice fragments. Crushing the ice fragments weakens the ice construction. If the weather is favorable (-10 to -15 degrees Celsius with wind), a 16- to 24-inch thick ice layer is usually frozen in a day. Laying ice blocks. This method is the quickest, but requires assests to transport the blocks from the nearest river or water reservoir to the site. Ice blocks, laid and overlapped like bricks, are of equal thickness and uniform size. To achieve good layer adhesion, the preceding layer is lightly sprayed with water before placing a new layer. Each new layer of blocks freezes onto the preceding layer before additional layers are placed. Frozen Soil Frozen soil is three to five times stronger than ice, and increases in strength with lower temperatures. Frozen soil has much better resistance to impact and explosion than to steadily- acting loads--an especially valuable feature for position construction purposes. Construction using frozen soil is performed as follows: • Preparing blocks of frozen soil from a mixture of water and aggregate (icecrete). • Laying prepared blocks of frozen soil. • Freezing blocks of frozen soil together in layers. Unfrozen soil from beneath the frozen layer is sometimes used to construct a position quickly before the soil freezes. Material made of gravel-sand-silt aggregate wetted to saturation and poured like portland cement concrete is also suitable for constructing positions. After freezing, the material has the properties of concrete. The construction methods used are analogous to those using ice. Fighting and protective positions in arctic areas are constructed both below ground and above ground. Below ground positions. When the frost layer is one foot or less, fighting positions are usually constructed below ground, as shown. Snow packed 8 to 9 feet provides protection from"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"_____________________________________________________________________FM 5-103 5-9 sustained direct fire from small caliber weapons up to and including the Soviet 14.5-mm KPV machine gun. When possible, unfrozen excavated soil is used to form parapets about 2-foot thick, and snow is placed on the soil for camouflage and extra protection. For added frontal protection, the interior snow is reinforced with a log revetment at least 3 inches in diameter. The outer surface is reinforced with small branches to initiate bullet tumble upon impact. Bullets slow down very rapidly in snow after they begin to tumble. The wall of logs directly in front of the position safely absorbs the slowed tumbling bullet. Overhead cover is constructed with 3 feet of packed snow placed atop a layer of 6-inch diameter logs. This protection is adequate to stop indirect fire fragmentation. A layer of small, 2-inch diameter logs is placed atop the packed snow to detonate quick fuzed shells before they become imbedded in the snow. Aboveground positions. If the soil is frozen to a significant depth, the soldier equipped with only an entrenching tool and ax will have difficulty digging a fighting position. Under these conditions (below the tree line), snow and wood are often the only natural materials available to construct fighting positions. The fighting position is dug at least 20 inches deep, up to chest height, depending on snow conditions. Ideally, sandbags are used to revet the interior walls for added protection and to prevent cave-ins. If sandbags are not available, a lattice frame-work is constructed using small branches or if time permits, a wall of 3-inch logs is built. Overhead cover, frontal protection, and side and rear parapets are built employing the same techniques described in chapter 4."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"FM 5-103_____________________________________________________________________ 5-10 It is approximately ten times faster to build above-ground snow positions than to dig in frozen ground to obtain the same degree of protection.

Heavy equipment use is limited by traction and maneuverability. Explosives are an expedient method, but require larger quantities than used in normal soil. Crater formation from surface bursts of explosives is possible and creates craters of a given depth and radius based on the information in the first table below.

Although snow is windproof, a layer of insulating material, such as a shelter half or blanket, is placed between the occupant and the snow to prevent body heat from melting the snow.

Fighting and protective positions range from hasty positions formed from piles of rubble, to deliberate positions located inside urban structures. Urban structures are the most advantageous locations for individual fighting positions. Field Manual 90-10 contains detailed information on urban terrain operations. Urban structures are usually divided into groups of below ground and above-ground structures."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"_____________________________________________________________________FM 5-103 5-17 Below Ground Structures A detailed knowledge of the nature and location of below ground facilities and structures is of potential value when planning survivability operations in urban terrain. Typical underground street cross sections are shown in the figure below. Sewers are separated into sanitary, storm, or combined systems. Sanitary sewers carry wastes and are normally too small for troop movement or protection. Storm sewers, however, provide rainfall removal and are often large enough to permit troop and occasional vehicle movement and protection. Except for groundwater, these sewers are dry during periods of no precipitation. During rain-storms, however, sewers fill rapidly and, though normally drained by electrical pumps, may overflow. During winter combat, snow melt may preclude daytime below ground operations. Another hazard is poor ventilation and the resultant toxic fume build-up that occurs in sewer tunnels and subways. The conditions in sewers provide an excellent breeding ground for disease, which demands proper troop hygiene and immunization."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"FM 5-103_____________________________________________________________________ 5-18 Subways tend to run under main roadways and have the potential hazard of having electrified rails and power leads. Passageways often extend outward from underground malls or storage areas, and catacombs are sometimes encountered in older sections of cities. Aboveground Structures Aboveground structures in urban areas are generally of two types: frameless and framed. Frameless structures. In frameless structures, the mass of the exterior wall performs the principal load-bearing functions of supporting dead weight of roofs, floors, ceilings; weight of furnishings and occupants; and horizontal loads. Frameless structures are shown below. Building materials for frameless structures include mud, stone, brick, cement building blocks, and reinforced concrete. Wall thickness varies with material and building height. Frameless structures have thicker walls than framed structures, and therefore are more resistant to projectile penetration. Fighting from frameless buildings is usually restricted to the door and window areas."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"_____________________________________________________________________FM 5-103 5-19 Frameless buildings vary with function, age, and cost of building materials. Older institutional buildings, such as churches, are frequently made of stone. Reinforced concrete is the principal material for wall and slab structures (apartments and hotels) and for prefabricated structures used for commercial and industrial purposes. Brick structures, the most common type of frameless buildings, dominate the core of urban areas (except in the relatively few parts of the world where wood-framed houses are common). Close-set brick structures up to five stories high are located on relatively narrow streets and form a hard, shock-absorbing protective zone for the inner city. The volume of rubble produced by their full or partial demolition provides countless fighting positions. Framed structures. Framed structures typically have a skeletal structure of columns and beams which supports both vertical and horizontal loads. Exterior (curtain) walls are nonload bearing. Without the impediment of load bearing walls, large open interior spaces offer little protection. The only available refuge is the central core of reinforced concrete present in many of these buildings (for example, the elevator shaft). Multistoried steel and concrete-framed structures occupy the valuable core area of most modern cities. Examples of framed structures are shown in the following figure. Material and Structural Characteristics Urban structures, frameless and framed, fit certain material generalities. The first table below converts building type and material into height/wall thicknesses.

The relationship between building height and thickness of the average brick wall is shown in the second table below. SPECIAL URBAN AREA POSITIONS Troop Protection After urban structures are classified as either frameless or framed, and some of their material characteristics are defined, leaders evaluate them for protective soundness. The evaluation is based on troop protection available and weapon position employment requirements for cover, concealment, and routes of escape. The table below summarizes survivability requirements for troop protection."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"_____________________________________________________________________FM 5-103 5-21 Cover. The extent of building cover depends on the proportion of walls to windows. It is necessary to know the proportion of non- windowed wall space which might serve as protection. Frameless buildings, with their high proportion of walls to windows, afford more substantial cover than framed buildings having both a lower proportion of wall to window space and thinner (nonload bearing) walls. Composition and thickness of both exterior and interior walls also have a significant bearing on cover assessment. Frameless buildings with their strong weight-bearing walls provide more cover than the curtain wails of framed buildings. However, interior walls of the older, heavy-clad, framed buildings are stronger than those of the new, light-clad, framed buildings. Cover within these light-clad framed buildings is very slight except in and behind their stair and elevator modules which are usually constructed of reinforced concrete. Familiarity with the location, dimension, and form of these modules is vital when assessing cover possibilities. Concealment. Concealment considerations involve some of the same elements of building construction, but knowledge of the venting (window) pattern and floor plan is added. These patterns vary with type of building construction and function. Older, heavy-clad framed buildings (such as office buildings) frequently have as full a venting pattern as"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"FM 5-103_____________________________________________________________________ 5-22 possible, while hotels have only one window per room. In the newer, light-clad framed buildings, windows are sometimes used as a nonload bearing curtain wall. If the windows are all broken, no concealment possibilities exist. Another aspect of concealment undetected movement within the building depends on a knowledge of the floor plan and the traffic pattern within the building on each floor and from floor to floor. Escape. In planning for escape routes, the floor plan, traffic patterns, and the relationships between building exits are considered. Possibilities range from small buildings with front street exits (posing unacceptable risks), to high-rise structures having exits on several floors, above and below ground level, and connecting with other buildings as well. Fighting Positions Survivability requirements for fighting positions for individuals, machine guns, and antitank and antiaircraft weapons are summarized in the table below. Individual fighting positions. An upper floor area of a multistoried building generally provides sufficient fields of"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"_____________________________________________________________________FM 5-103 5-23 fire, although corner windows can usually encompass more area. Protection from the possibility of return fire from the streets requires that the soldier know the composition and thickness of the building's outer wall. Load bearing walls generally offer more protection than the curtain walls of framed buildings. However, the relatively thin walls of a low brick building (only two-bricks thick or 8 inches) is sometimes less effective than a 15-inch thick nonload bearing curtain wall of a high-rise framed structure. The individual soldier is also concerned about the amount of overhead protection available. Therefore, the soldier needs to know about the properties of roof, floor, and ceiling materials. These materials vary with the type of building construction. In brick buildings, the material for the ceiling of the top floor is far lighter than that for the next floor down that performs as both ceiling and floor, and thus is capable of holding up the room's live load. Machine gun positions. Machine guns are usually located on the ground floor to achieve grazing fire. In brick buildings, the lower floors have the thickest walls and thus the greatest degree of cover. In frame buildings, walls are the same thickness on every floor and thus the ground floor provides no advantage. Another consideration is the nature of the local terrain. Should a building selected for a machine gun position lie over the crest of a hill, grazing fire is sometimes not possible from a ground floor. In such cases, depending on the area's slope angle, grazing fire is achieved only from a higher floor. Antitank weapon positions. The positioning of antitank weapons within buildings demands consideration of the critical need for cover. Buildings with fairly thick walls have rooms that are too small to permit firing of heavy antitank weapons, such as the TOW. Therefore, only the LAW, Dragon, and the 90-mm recoilless rifle (RCLR) are usually fired from these buildings. When antitank weapons are fired, backblast is present as illustrated below."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"FM 5-103_____________________________________________________________________ 5-24 When weapons are fired in enclosed areas in structures, the following conditions are required: • The area must have a ceiling at least 7 feet high. Minimum floor sizes by weapon and type of construction are as shown in the table below. • Approximately 20 square feet of ventilation is necessary to the rear of the weapons. An open door normally provides adequate ventilation. • Small, loose objects and window/door glass are removed from the firing area. • Combustible material is removed from behind the weapon. Curtains and over-stuffed furniture out of the blast area are usually left in place to help absorb sound. • For ATGMs, vertical clearances between the bottom of the launch tube and the wall opening are 6 inches for TOW and 9 inches for Dragon. • Occupants must be forward of the rear of the weapon and wear helmets and earplugs."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"_____________________________________________________________________FM 5-103 5-25 For heavy ATGMs (TOWS) designed for effectiven ess up to 3,750 meters, there is an acute need to select light-clad framed buildings that have considerable fields of fire. Antiaircraft weapon positions. The deployment of antiaircraft weapons can also be related to a consideration of building characteristics. An ideal type of building for such deployment is a modern parking garage (one with rooftop parking). It offers sufficient cover, a circulation pattern favoring such weapons carried on light vehicles, and frequently offers good lines of sight. Other Planning Considerations Fighting and protective positions located inside urban buildings sometimes require upgrade or reinforcement. Prior to planning building modification, the following factors are considered: • Availability of materials such as fill for sandbags. • Transporting materials up stairwells and into attics. • Structural limitations of attics and upper level floors (dead load limitations). COMBINED OPERATIONS The United States maintains substantial forces in Europe for North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) operations and forces in Korea as part of the combined forces command (CFC). In these areas, established command and control arrangements permit detailed peacetime planning, base development, and host nation support agreements. In most potential combat theaters, however, international agreements with United States allies on principles and procedures do not exist or are only partially developed. In both types of possible theaters of operations, combat activities will involve combined operations with allied forces."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"FM 5-103_____________________________________________________________________ 5-26 Interoperability is the capability of multinational forces to operate together smoothly. Commanders involved in combined survivability operations must have a knowledge of standing operating procedures (SOPS), standardization agreements (STANAGS), and any other procedural agreements made between forces. In addition, a commander should maximize training and use of equipment and supplies organic to friendly foreign forces. Host nation support agreements may provide equipment and indigenous labor for protective construction. These assets require full identification and use. Interoperability is discussed in FM 100-5. Terrain and climate characteristics of the following three NATO regions are critical to the survivability planner in Europe. ALLIED FORCES, NORTHERN EUROPE (AFNORTH) The Northern European Command, also known as Allied Forces, Northern Europe (AFNORTH), is made up of Norway, Denmark, and that portion of the Federal Republic of Germany north of the Elbe river. The climate of this area includes subarctic and arctic winters which, in some locales, 8 months out of the year. Terrain is generally very lightly wooded and susceptible to flooding in many areas. ALLIED FORCES, CENTRAL EUROPE (AFCENT) Allied Forces, Central Europe (AFCENT) includes most of Western Europe-specifically West Germany. The climate of this area is usually cold and wet. The terrain is generally rolling and open, with many urban and built-up areas of 50,000 population and upward. ALLIED FORCES, SOUTHERN EUROPE (AFSOUTH) Allied Forces, Southern Europe (AFSOUTH) includes Italy, Greece, Turkey, and countries in the Mediterranean area. Generally, this area has a warm and comfortable climate, but it also includes some bitterly cold regions. The terrain of northern Italy, Greece, Turkish Thrace, and eastern Turkey is mountainous and affords excellent natural protection. The plains of the Po River Valley, however, provide unrestricted mobility and direct fire, and require substantial protection activities. "},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"_____________________________________________________________________FM 5-103 5-27 PACIFIC COMMAND (PACOM) United States forces stationed from the west coast of the Americas to the east coast of Africa and in the Indian Ocean come under the umbrella of the Pacific Command (PACOM). Two important areas of the command are Japan and Korea. As in NATO, important differences in capabilities, doctrine, and equipment exist among various national forces in PACOM. Unlike NATO, few STANAGS exist to negotiate the differences. Korea The powerful North Korean army is a threat to the Republic of Korea (ROK). It is continually poised for attack along the 151- mile demilitarized zone (DMZ). The area in which protection activities would take place includes mountainous, rugged terrain with a temperate, monsoonal climate. Most of the terrain favors light infantry operations, yet two major avenues of approach from the north allow mechanized activity. Because of the segregation of US and ROK units, existing survivability /interoperability problems are considered when protection activities are planned. Japan The five major islands of Japan have a climate similar to that of the east coast of the United States. The islands are mostly mountainous, with the urban areas and huge population centers situated in and around the remaining habitable areas. Operations in Japan are governed by the provisions of the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan. Significant efforts are required to ensure interoperability of forces. Survivability tasks will most likely center around protection of built-up areas. CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS Contingency operations, generally initiated under circumstances of great urgency, are geared to protect vital natural resource supplies or assist a threatened ally. The US contingency force must have the capability to defeat a threat which varies from terrorist activity to well-organized regional forces armed with modern weapons. Contingency forces must prepare for chemical and nuclear warfare, and also for air attack by modern, well- equipped air forces.

Most potential locations for contingency operations are relatively undeveloped. Logistics and base support requirements will dictate operational capabilities to a much greater extent than in a mature theater. Planners must provide ample logistic basic loads for initial construction and use locally available materials for expedient structures. General contingency plans must allow for rapid changes in the tasks, organization, and support to adapt to widely-varied potential threats and environments. The composition of the contingency force must permit rapid strategic deployment by air. At the same time, it must possess sufficient combat power and equipment to provide necessary engineer support. The lack of logistic support for the deployed task force requires a capability to fully exploit whatever host nation support is available. Deployed engineer forces are responsible for all engineer functions. Initially, there is little back-up support for engineers organic to combat forces; however, engineer support in the survivability effort is essential. Survivability missions in contingency operations are of primary importance after deployment. The force requires protection at all levels since the enemy often expects the force's arrival, and since assembly areas are limited until specific missions are developed. Due to the light force structure and limited logistical support, priorities are established to determine where the engineers should dedicate their resources. Conditions such as delayed supply and resupply operations, and scarcity of engineer equipment, demand force maneuver units or light forces to prepare their own fighting and protective positions. The situation will determine whether shifts from those priorities are necessary."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":" A - 1 APPENDIX A SURVIVABILITY EQUIPMENT This appendix contains powered survivability equipment used in engineer operations.

These devices detect reflected short-wave and radiated long-wave infrared (ir) energy. Special video devices \"read\" ir energy and detect dead or dying vegetation as well as objects painted similar to their surroundings. As a counter, special camouflage paint having a short-wave infrared response much like natural vegetation is available. The long-wave or thermal infrared energy radiated by a surface depends on the surface temperature. Hot surfaces radiate much more energy than cool surfaces; thus, hot surfaces are normally easier to detect with thermal infrared or heat- sensitive devices. Certain precautions are taken against detection by these devices. • Hot objects such as generators, stoves, or other heat- generating items are not openly exposed. • Artificial surfaces are shaded or insulated to reduce solar heating. • Distinctive shapes or patterns which readily identify the type of feature or facility are obscured. If natural material is used for camouflage, there are two major considerations. First, gathering natural material nearby creates voids, changes the appearance of the natural surroundings, and reduces the effectiveness of the camouflage. Therefore, limbs are cut from several trees, not just one. Also, limbs are cut as close to the trunk or main branch as possible. A tree should still appear \"natural\" after branches are cut. Secondly, while natural material aids both visual and infrared camouflage initially, it loses effectiveness as it dries out. Thus, when vegetation is cut for camouflage use, it is watered and/or replaced as it withers. The replaced camouflage is disposed of so that it does not draw attention to the concealed area. Excess soil from constructed positions, waste materials, and any worn or damaged camouflage are moved to another area and made to look like natural terrain. These materials are also used for constructing a poorly camouflaged dummy position. Regardless of the materials used to camouflage a bivouac site, both visual and infrared capabilities are considered. For example, a field fortification constructed of galvanized steel is set in a grassy area. During midday, the steel appears"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"FM 5-103 _____________________________________________________________________ D - 2 unnaturally bright to both visible and thermal infrared sensing devices. In the visible range, it reflects more light than the grass and differs in color. In the short-wave infrared range, it appears darker than the surrounding vegetation. In the thermal infrared range, it is much hotter than sod or vegetation. Sodding the roof camouflages the position for all three types of always possible, artificial materials are used. Paint or nets, such as those used on vehicles, may help. Paint protects against detection by visible and short-wave infrared devices, but shading by nets reduces the thermal infrared signature and thus the detectability of the site to heat-sensitive devices. Natural Materials Natural materials are used for the three methods of concealment- hiding, blending, and disguising. Indigenous materials provide the best concealment, are economical, and reduce logistic requirements. For camouflaging, natural materials are divided into four groups: growing vegetation (cut and planted), cut and dead vegetation, inert substances of the earth, and debris. Cut vegetation is used for temporary concealment, completing or supplementing natural cover, and augmenting artificial cover. It is also excellent for overhead screening if cuttings are carefully placed to appear as in the natural state. Cut foliage wilts and is therefore replaced frequently (every 3 to 5 hours). In addition, cutting large amounts reveals the site. Inert substances such as cut grass, hay, straw, or dead branches require very little maintenance. However, because of their dry nature, these items are a potential fire hazard and lose their ability to provide infrared detection protection. Inert materials are ideal when vegetation is dormant. Other substances such as soil, sand, and gravel are used to change or add color, provide coarse texture, simulate cleared areas, or create shapes. Debris such as boxes, tin cans, old bottles and junkyard items are also used for camouflage in some cases. In winter, snow is used, but some differences are expected between undisturbed and reworked snow, especially with infrared detection devices. Man-Made Materials Man-made materials fall into three categories: hiding and screening, garnishing and texturing, and coloring."},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"_____________________________________________________________________FM 5-103 D - 3 Hiding and screening materials include prefabricated nets, net sets, wire netting, snow fencing, truck tarpaulins, smoke, and so forth. Generally, these materials are most effective when used to blend with natural overhead or lateral cover. Garnishing and texturing materials are used to add the desired texture to such items as nets and screens. Examples of such materials are gravel, cinders, sawdust, fabric strips, feathers, wood shoring, and Spanish moss. Coloring with standard camouflage paint, available in ten colors in addition to black and white, allows selecting a color scheme which blends with any natural surrounding. Normally, standard camouflage paint has a dull finish, is nonfading, possesses a certain degree of infrared reflectivity, covers in one coat, and lasts approximately 9 months. If this paint is not available, other materials such as crankcase oil, grease, or field- expedient paint can be used as a stopgap measure. FIELD SITE DEVELOPMENT The four stages in the development of a field site are planning, occupation, maintenance, and evacuation. Since units often move without an opportunity to plan, the first stage is sometimes eliminated. In that case, the five points listed in the following paragraph are satisfied after arrival to the area. Planning Because of the frequent halts characteristic of modern mobile warfare, planning is difficult. Since there is seldom time or facilities available for elaborate construction, sites are quickly entered and evacuated. However, no matter how swift the operation or how limited the time and facilities, the unit commander plans for concealment. The general area of the halt is determined by the tactical plan. Prior to entering the area, the quartering party becomes familiar with the terrain pattern through a careful study of maps and aerial photographs. The party is also fully acquainted with the tactical plan and the camouflage requirements. The five critical points for the party are: • Unit mission. • Access routes. • Existing concealment. • Area size. • Concealment of all-around position defense."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"FM 5-103 _____________________________________________________________________ D - 4 Camouflage begins before the unit moves in to occupy the site. Vehicles are carefully controlled in their movements so telltale tracks do not lead directly to a camouflaged position. All traffic moves on existing roads or trails or follows tree lines. Occupation Occupation is achieved with a carefully controlled traffic plan which is strictly followed. Guides posted at route junctions, fully aware of the camouflage plan, enforce camouflage discipline. Turn-ins are marked to prevent widening of corners by vehicles. Foot troops follow marked paths as closely as possible. The position is sited so that it is not silhouetted against the sky when viewed from an attacker's ground position. It also blends--not contrasts--into the background. Maximum use of trees, bushes, and dark areas of the terrain reduces the amount of camouflage required and the likelihood of air observation. It is equally important that the concealing cover not be isolated, since a lone clump of vegetation or a solitary structure is a conspicuous hiding place and will draw enemy fire whether the enemy \"sees\" anything or not. The terrain should look natural and not be disturbed any more than absolutely necessary. This objective is best accomplished by removing or camouflaging the spoil. Natural terrain lines, such as edges of fields, fences, hedgerows, and rural cultivation patterns, are excellent sites for positions since they reduce the possibility of aerial observation. Regular geometric layouts are avoided. The lightweight camouflage screening system (LWCSS) is especially important in preventing identification of recognizable military outlines. Before any excavation is started, all natural materials, such as turf, leaves, forest humus, or snow, are removed, placed aside, and later used for restoring the natural appearance of the terrain. When a position cannot be sited under natural cover, camouflaged covers are valuable aids in preventing detection. Materials native to the area are preferred; however, when natural materials are used over a position, they must be replaced before they wilt, change color, and lead to detection. Maintenance Next to occupation, maintenance is the most critical stage. If the occupation was successful from a camouflage standpoint, maintenance is relatively simple. Successful maintenance"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"_____________________________________________________________________FM 5-103 D - 5 involves frequent inspection of camouflage; active patrol measures for discipline; and, where possible, aerial observation and photos. When critical unit activities require congestion of troops, such as for dining, the traffic plan must be rigidly enforced. It is often necessary to use artificial overhead cover, such as LWCSS. Garbage disposal pits are concealed, with special care given to the spoil. During hours of reduced visibility, it is human nature to relax and assume that the enemy cannot see during darkness or in fog; however, the maintenance of noise and light discipline, as well as camouflage, is important at all times. Failure to maintain light and noise discipline may make all other methods of camouflage ineffective. Even during periods of reduced visibility, an exposed light can be seen for several miles. Any unusual noise or noise common to military activity may draw attention to its source. New thermal imagery technology is capable of detecting equipment not covered by thermal camouflage nets, regardless of light or weather conditions. Generators, heaters, or any other running engines create additional thermal signatures which must be limited as much as possible. As a result, stricter camouflage discipline is required during the hours of reduced visibility, since a camouflage-undisciplined unit will become even more recognizable. Wire and taped paths will aid personnel in finding their way with minimum use of flashlights. Evacuation Although evacuation is the last operation at the halt site, camouflage does not end when the unit prepares to move out. An evacuated area can be left in such a state that aerial photos reveal the strength and type of unit, its equipment, and even its destination. It is an important part of camouflage to leave the area looking undisturbed. Trash is carefully disposed of or taken with the unit. Spoil is returned to its original location to assume a unit is not engaged when it departs. If engaged, it may not be possible to return the site to its original appearance. CAMOUFLAGE OF UNIT POSITIONS Command Post Since the command post is the nerve center of a military unit, it is a highly-sought enemy target. Command posts have functional requirements which result in creating easily- identifiable signatures such as--"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"FM 5-103 _____________________________________________________________________ D - 6 • Converging communication lines, both wire and road. • Concentration of vehicles. • Heavy traffic which causes widened turn-ins. • Antennas. • New access routes to a position which could house a command post. • Protective wire and other barriers surrounding the site. • Defensive weapon positions around the site. Primary camouflage solutions include intelligent use of the terrain and backgrounds, and strict enforcement of camouflage discipline. Site Requirements The site requirements of a large command post are primarily reconnaissance and layout, quartering parties, rapid concealment of elements, camouflage discipline, and a well-policed track plan to prevent visitors from violating it. Since a large headquarters is likely to remain in an area for a greater length of time than a halted maneuver unit, the site must be capable of being disclosed by changes in the terrain pattern. It is unwise to locate a headquarters in the only large building within an extensive area of operations. If the command post is located in a building, there must be other buildings in the area to prevent the target from being pin pointed. Communications Communications are the lifeblood of a command post. Command posts sited to take advantage of existing roads and telephone arid telegraph wires are easiest to conceal. When new communication means must be created, natural cover and terrain lines are used. The use of remote communications should be concealed wherever possible. Discipline After the site has been selected and camouflaged to supplement whatever natural concealment is present, continued concealment depends on discipline. Tracks are controlled; vehicles are parked several hundred meters from the command post; security weapons and positions are concealed and tracks to them made inconspicuous; all spoil is concealed, and protective and communication wires follow terrain lines and are concealed as much as possible. Night blackout discipline is rigidly enforced. Routes to visitor parking areas are maintained in accordance with the track plan. Power generation equipment is also"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"_____________________________________________________________________FM 5-103 D - 7 concealed to protect against noise and infrared signature detection. In open terrain where natural concealment is afforded only by small scrub growth and rocks, overhead camouflage is obtained by using the LWCSS. Even in desert terrain, broken ground and scrub vegetation form irregular patterns and are blended with artificial materials. Digging-in reduces shadow and silhouettes, and simplifies draping positions or tents. In open terrain, dispersion is particularly important. Routes between elements are concealed or made by indirect in straight lines. CAMOUFLAGE OF CIVILIAN STRUCTURES A headquarters within an existing civilian structure presents the problem of hiding day movement and concealing the evidence of night activity when blackout conditions prevail. Military movement in a village or a group of farm buildings is less discoverable if kept to a minimum. Attempts to alter the appearance of buildings by disruptive painting is evidence of occupation and simply reveals a military presence. Erection of a small structure simulating a new garage or other auxiliary civilian building is unlikely to arouse suspicion. Any major changes, however, especially if the enemy is familiar with the area, will be closely scanned by enemy air observers. When buildings are partially destroyed and left debris-littered, installations are camouflaged with debris to blend with the rough and jagged lines of the surroundings. A few broken timbers, pieces of broken plaster, and a few scattered rags accomplish quick and effective concealment. Other debris usually available includes rubble, scrap metal, wrecked vehicles, and furniture. CAMOUFLAGE OF SUPPLY POINTS Camouflage of a supply point includes all the difficulties of both maneuver unit and command post concealment, plus a number of particularly troublesome factors peculiar to supply points alone. Supply points vary in size from large concentrations of materials in rear areas, to small piles of supplies in the forward areas. Large amounts of equipment are quickly brought up, unloaded, and concealed, yet are easily accessible for redistribution. Flattops are used effectively providing the supply points are not too large, time and materials are available, and they blend with the terrain. For supply points which cannot be concealed, decoy points will often disperse the force of an enemy attack."},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"FM 5-103 _____________________________________________________________________ D - 8 Natural concealment and cover are used whenever possible. Stacks of supplies are dispersed to minimize damage from a single attack. New access roads are planned using existing overhead cover. In more permanent installations, tracks running through short open areas are concealed by overhead nets slung between trees. Traffic control includes measures to conceal activity and movement at, to, and from the installation. Even when natural cover is sparse or nonexistent, natural terrain features are advantageously used. In cultivated fields, supplies are laid out along cultivation lines and textured with strip-garnished twine nets to resemble standing stubble. In plowed fields, supplies are stacked parallel to the furrows and covered with earth-colored burlap for effective concealment. Access routes are made along the furrow, and no unnatural lines appear on the pattern. Camouflage discipline measures at supply points include track plans that result in minimal changes to terrain appearance, debris control to prevent accumulation and enemy detection, concealment and control of trucks waiting to draw supplies, and camouflage maintenance. CAMOUFLAGE OF WATER POINTS Effective concealment of water points and other support activities require • An adequately concealed road net. • Sufficient concealment to hide waiting vehicles. • Adequate concealment-artificial or natural for operating personnel, storage tanks, and pumping and purification equipment. • Strict enforcement of camouflage discipline. • Control of spilled water and adequate drainage to prevent standing pools of water which reflect light. Foliage not sufficiently thick for perfect concealment is supplemented by natural materials or LWCSS. Concealment is required for water point equipment, the shine of water in the tanks, and any small open areas that are crossed by vehicles or personnel. Shine on water is concealed by a canvas cover or foliage. The characteristic shape of tanks is distorted by foliage or artificial materials. Camouflage discipline at a water point requires a water supply schedule for using units. Lack of a schedule, or violation of it, usually causes a jam of waiting vehicles which cannot be concealed."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"_____________________________________________________________________FM 5-103 D - 9 CAMOUFLAGE OF CREW-SERVED AND INDIVIDUAL FIGHTING POSITIONS If positions are expertly camouflaged and maintained, the enemy will have great difficulty in locating them until stumbling into a kill zone. Natural materials used to camouflage fighting positions should be indigenous to the area. As an example, willow branches from the edge of a stream will not appear natural in a grove of oaks. Since spoil may differ in color from the ground surface, it may be necessary to camouflage the soil or remove it from the unit area. Routes taken by troops to fighting positions are obscured so footprints or telephone lines do not reveal the positions. All camouflage procedures used for any field location, both visual and thermal, are successfully applied and maintained. CAMOUFLAGE OF OTHER DEFENSIVE POSITIONS Other positions are camouflaged the same way as positions located in the defensive area. Positions include those for major weapons, special design shelters, protective walls (in some cases, obstacles), and trenches. CAMOUFLAGE IN SPECIAL TERRAIN Special terrain conditions, such as deserts, snow regions, and urban areas require special camouflage measures. Deserts Areas where there is no large convenient overhead cover are unplowed fields, rocky areas, grasslands, and other wide-open spaces. In certain types of flat terrain, shadow patterns and judicious use of drape nets render objects inconspicuous. Units in deserts or other featureless terrains are highly vulnerable to breaches of light or sound discipline during day or night. The eye's capability to reasonably discern stationary objects is greatly reduced by this type of terrain. Dust trails from moving vehicles identify a military position faster than open, stationary, noncamouflaged vehicles. Luminosity at night in open plain areas significantly degrades depth perception and, dependent upon surface texture, makes visual observation useless at long ranges and significantly enhances sound detection methods."},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"FM 5-103 _____________________________________________________________________ D - 10 A desert version of the LWCSS provides concealment against visual, near infrared, and radar target acquisition/surveillance sensor devices. A radar transparent version of the LWCSS allows US units to camouflage radar without degrading operations. The desert camouflage net is a complete cover since it depends on ground surface imitation, both in color and texture, for effect. Snow Regions A blanket of snow often eliminates much of the ground pattern and makes blending difficult. Differences in texture and color disappear or become less marked. Snow-covered terrain, however, is rarely completely white. By taking advantage of dark features in the lines, stream-beds, evergreen trees, bushes, shadows of snowdrifts, folds in the ground, and the black shadows of hillsides a unit on the move or halted successfully blends itself into the terrain. However, exhaust, ice fog, and infrared signatures are difficult to overcome regardless of how well the unit is hidden. Good route selection in snow-covered terrain is usually more important than any other camouflage measure. Because of the exposed tracks, skis and snowshoes are not used near the area since their marks are more sharply defined than foot tracks, and may be discovered with infrared imagery."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"_____________________________________________________________________FM 5-103 D - 11 <> To avoid tracking up the area, personnel, vehicles, and material are restricted from open areas. Well concealed positions in snow terrain are easily identified when the snow melts, unless precautions are taken. Light discipline is enforced to prevent disclosure of the position. Compacted snow on well-traveled paths melts slower than the uncompacted snow, and leaves visible white lines on a dark background. The snow is then broken up and spread out to hasten melting. By following communication lines or other lines which are a natural part of the terrain, tracks are minimized. Tracks coinciding with such lines are harder to identify. A turn-in is concealed and the tracks themselves continued beyond the point. Windswept drift lines cast shadows and are followed as much as possible. Straight tracks to an important installation are avoided. Snow region camouflage nets and paints assist in camouflage operations. Urban Areas Because vegetation is scarce in urban areas, maximum use is made of the shadows available. Outside buildings, vehicles and defensive positions use the shadows to obscure their presence. Troops inside buildings observe from the shadow side of a window in order to be inconspicuous. Combat in the urban environment usually produces considerable rubble from damaged buildings and roads. This material is used for obstacles as well as camouflage for defensive positions. These positions are blended into the terrain and placed behind rubble as it would naturally fall from a building."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"FM 5-103 _____________________________________________________________________ D - 12 In urban areas, the prime concerns for individual fighting positions are exposure and muzzle flash. When firing from behind a wall, the soldier fires around cover (when possible), not over it. When firing from a window, the soldier avoids standing in the opening and being e xposed to return fire. Also, the soldier avoids firing with the gun muzzle protruding, especially at night when muzzle flash is so obvious. When firing from a loophole, the soldier gains cover and concealment. The soldier is positioned well back from the loophole to keep the weapon from protruding and to conceal muzzle flash. When firing from the peak of a roof, soldiers use available cover. The principles for individual fighting positions also apply for crew-served weapons positions, but with the following added requirements. When employing recoilless weapons (90-mm RCLR and LAW), the soldiers select positions which allow for backblast. Shown is a building corner improved with sandbags to make an excellent firing position. Similarly, another means of allowing for backblast while taking advantage of cover in an elevated position is also shown. When structures are elevated, positions are prepared to take advantage of overhead cover. However, care is taken to ensure that backblast is not contained under the building, causing damage or collapse of the structure, or possible injury to the crew.
