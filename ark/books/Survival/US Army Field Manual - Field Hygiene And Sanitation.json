MESSAGE TO THE UNIT COMMANDER DISEASE AND NONBATTLE INJURY A DNBI casualty can be defined as a military person who is lost to an organization by reason of disease or injury, and who is not a battle casualty. This definition includes persons who are dying of disease or injury due to accidents directly related to the operation or mission to which they were deployed. The acronym, DNBI, does not include service members missing involuntarily because of enemy action or being interned by the enemy (as a prisoner of war). The total number of DNBI casualties is evaluated to identify DNBI rates per number of service members in an operation. The DNBI rates are critical in evaluating the effectiveness of PVNTMED missions within the area of operations (AO) and in determining the health of a force within an operation. Historically, in every conflict the US has been involved in, only 20 percent of all hospital admissions have been from combat injuries. The other 80 percent have been from DNBI. Excluded from these figures are vast numbers of service members with decreased combat effectiveness due to DNBI not serious enough for hospital admission."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"1-2 FM 21-10/MCRP 4-11.1D Preventive medicine measures are simple, common sense actions that any service member can perform and every leader must know.

Both units had to be replaced (medically evacuated) without seeing any enemy action because they were not combat ready. The use of insect repellents and insecticides and the elimination of standing water would have prevented this. Merrillís Marauders : Disease was an important detractor to this famous unit. The medical threat faced by the Marauders in the jungles of Burma was great. Everyone was sick, but some had to stay and fight. Evacuation was limited to those with high fever and severe illness. One entire platoon cut the seats from their pants because severe diarrhea had to be relieved during gunfights. After a bold and successful attack on a major airfield, Merrillís Marauders were so decimated by disease that they were disbanded. Section II.

HEAT INJURIES OVERVIEW Heat injuries can occur anywhere, depending on physical activity (work rate) and clothing worn. However, they occur most frequently during warm-weather training, exposure to high climatic temperatures, high humidity, and bright sunlight. These conditions make it difficult for the body to regulate its temperature. Hot weather also increases daily water requirements, because body water is lost as sweat. Dehydration leads to added heat stress, increased susceptibility to heat injury, reduced work performance, and degraded mission capability. ACCLIMATIZATION When the mission permits, all personnel should work and exercise in a manner so that they gradually become acclimatized to the heat and humidity in the AO. Significant heat acclimatization requires at least"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"2-2 FM 21-10/MCRP 4-11.1D 3 to 5 days and full acclimatization can take up to 2 weeks. Exercising in the heat and humidity for 1 to 2 hours daily, gradually increasing the workload each day, can produce acclimatization. (Refer to Table 3-1 in Chapter 3.) When the mission does not permit time for gradual increases in workload, then leaders and buddies must observe each other and ensure that everyone drinks plenty of water during each work period. Individuals leaving a cold or cool climate will require additional time to become acclimatized to a hot climate. DRINK PLENTY OF WATER Depending on the heat and activity level, you may need to drink from 1 / 2 to 1 1 / 4 quarts of water per houró 3 gallons/12 liters per day in hot, dry climates . Drinking water is a must in order to prevent heat injury. If desired, individuals may add flavoring to the water to enhance consumption. Field rations/meal(s), ready to eat (MRE) have flavoring for water in each meal. It the flavoring is used, add it to water in your canteen cup. Do not add flavoring to the water in your canteen; it increases the risk of contamination and illness. Never flavor the bulk source water supply. (Flavoring the bulk source water supply will reduce the action of water disinfectants.) See Table 3-1 for water intake requirements. ï Drink extra water before starting any mission or hard work. Cool water (60∞ to 70∞ Fahrenheit [F]) is absorbed faster than cold water. ï Drink small quantities of cool fluids frequently. Carbohydrate/electrolyte beverages (sport drinks) may provide supplemental nutrients under conditions of extreme calorie and water requirements; such as extremely vigorous activity. However, they cannot replace and must not be used to meet all water requirements."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"FM 21-10/MCRP 4-11.1D 2-3 ï Drink ìnon-caffeinatedî fluids even if you are not thirsty. (Caffeine increases water requirements in all environments.) ï Refill your canteens at every opportunity, using only treated water, if possible. NOTE The color and volume of the urine steam are good indicators of a service memberís hydration status. If your urine stream is dark yellow and the volume is small, or if you are constipated and experience hard stools, you may not be drinking enough water. Maintain a urine stream that is clear or light yellow . Thirst is not a good indicator of dehydration during physical activity. USE WORK/REST CYCLES ï Work and rest as your leader directs. (See Table 3-1.) A rest period helps prevent dangerous increases in body temperatures by minimizing heat production. ï Work and rest in the shade, if possible."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"2-4 FM 21-10/MCRP 4-11.1D EAT ALL MEALS TO REPLACE SALTS Eating all meals in the field will usually provide the bodyís requirements for salts. Field rations/MRE meet the daily requirements for minerals and electrolytes (sodium). DO NOT take extra salt in meals unless medically indicated. NOTE DO NOT TAKE SALT TABLETS. One salt tablet increases your water requirement by at least a pint. Salt draws water from muscles to dilute your blood. Salt tablets can cause vomiting. RECOGNIZE THE RISK OF MISSION-ORIENTED PROTECTIVE POSTURE/BODY ARMOR/ARMORED VEHICLES ï Mission-oriented protective posture (MOPP)/body armor increases your heat stress. (See Table 3-1.) You mustó ï Drink more water. DO NOT EXCEED 1 1 / 4 QUARTS PER HOUR. ï Work and rest as your leader directs."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"FM 21-10/MCRP 4-11.1D 2-5 ï You may be at a greater risk of heat injuries when in armored vehiclesóyou may need to drink more water.

NOTE When the threat from biting arthropods is high, keep your shirtsleeves rolled down and pants bloused in boots."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"2-6 FM 21-10/MCRP 4-11.1D NOTE See Graphic Training Aid (GTA) 8-5-50 and FM 21-11, for information on heat injury prevention and first aid. Section II. COLD INJURIES OVERVIEW Cold injuries are most likely to occur when an unprepared individual is exposed to winter temperatures. They can even occur with the proper planning and equipment. The cold weather and the type of operation in which the individual is involved impact on whether a service member is likely to be injured and to what extent. The service memberís clothing, physical condition, and mental makeup are also determining factors. Well-disciplined and well-trained service members can be protected, even in the most adverse conditions. Service members and their leaders must know the hazards of exposure to the cold. They must know the importance of personal hygiene, exercise, care of the feet and hands, and the use of protective clothing. Cold injuries may be divided into ìfreezing and nonfreezingî types. A freezing type is frostbite. The nonfreezing types are chilblains, trench foot, and immersion foot. (See FM 21-11.) ï Frostbite can occur when the temperature is at or near freezing or colder. Frostbite can also occur when the skin is exposed to winds of less than five miles per hour and actual temperature readings of 30∞ F."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"FM 21-10/MCRP 4-11.1D 2-7 ï Trench foot (and immersion foot) results from prolonged exposure to a wet, cold condition, or the outright immersion of the feet in water with a temperature usually below 50∞ F. ï At the upper range of temperatures, exposure of 12 hours or more will cause injury. Shorter duration at or near 32∞ F will cause the same injury. ï A trench foot injury is usually associated with immobilization of the feet. WEAR UNIFORM PROPERLY ï Wear the clothing your commander and leaders direct. ï Wear clothing in loose layers (top and bottom). Avoid tight clothing, including tight underwear. ï Keep clothing clean and dry. Remove or loosen excess clothing when working or in heated areas to prevent sweating. ï Wear headgear to prevent body heat loss. The body loses large amounts of heat through the head. ï Avoid spilling fuel or other liquids on clothing or skin. Evaporating liquids increase heat loss and cool the skin. Also, liquid stains on clothing will reduce the clothingís protective effects."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"2-8 FM 21-10/MCRP 4-11.1D ï Change wet/damp clothes as soon as possible. Wet/damp clothing pulls heat from body. KEEP YOUR BODY WARM ï Keep moving, if possible. ï Exercise your big muscles (arms, shoulders, trunk, and legs) frequently to keep warm. ï If you must remain in a small area, exercise your toes, feet, fingers, and hands. ï Avoid the use of alcohol as it makes your body lose heat faster. ï Avoid standing directly on cold, wet ground, when possible. ï Avoid tobacco products. The use of tobacco products decreases blood flow to your skin. ï Eat all meals to maintain energy. ï Drink plenty of water and/or warm nonalcoholic fluids. Dark yellow urine means you are not drinking enough fluids! You can dehydrate in cold climates too! ï Buddies should monitor each other for cold weather injury."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"FM 21-10/MCRP 4-11.1D 2-9 PROTECT YOUR FEET ï Bring several pairs of issue boot socks with you. ï Keep socks clean and dry. Change wet or damp socks as soon as possible. Socks can become wet from sweating. Apply foot powder on feet and in boots when changing socks. ï Wash your feet daily, if possible. ï Avoid tight socks and boots (completely lace boots up as loosely as possible). ï Wear overshoes to keep boots dry. NOTE A decrease in physical activity reduces the exposure time necessary to produce injury. In all types of footgear, feet perspire more and are generally less well ventilated than other parts of the body. Moisture accumulates in socks, decreasing their insulating quality. The feet are susceptible to cold injury and are less frequently observed than the remainder of the body. PROTECT YOUR HANDS ï Wear gloves with inserts, or mittens with inserts."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"2-10 FM 21-10/MCRP 4-11.1D ï Warm hands under clothing if they become numb. ï Avoid skin contact with snow, fuel, or bare metal. ï Waterproof gloves by treating with waterproofing compounds, such as snow seal. PROTECT YOUR FACE AND EARS ï Cover your face and ears with a scarf or other material, if available. ï Wear your insulated cap with flaps down or wear a balaclava and secure under your chin. ï Warm your face and ears by covering them with your hands. Do not rub face and ears. ï Do not use face camouflage when windchill is -10∞ F or below; prevents detection of cold weather injury (frostbite). NOTE Rubbing cold extremities can be potentially harmful. Frostbitten areas that are rubbed can cause additional injury to the affected areas. ï Wear sunscreen. Solar UV exposure is doubled when you are surrounded by snow. ï Exercise facial muscles."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"FM 21-10/MCRP 4-11.1D 2-11 PROTECT YOUR EYES ï Wear sunglasses (or goggles) (Sun, Wind, and Dust, National Stock Number [NSN] 8465-01-004-2893) to prevent snow blindness (gray lens insert for above system is NSN 8465-01-004-2891). ï Wear Spectacles, Protective, Laser-Ballistic, NSN 8465-01-416-4626, or Special Protective Eyewear, Cylindrical System, NSN 8465-01-416-4626. ï Improvised sunglasses (slit goggles), if actual sunglasses are not available, can be made from the field rations/MRE cardboard box or other opaque material. PROTECT YOUR BUDDY ï Watch for signs of frostbite on the service memberís exposed skin. The affected skin will appear as pale/ gray/waxy areas (it may be hard to see these changes in poor lighting or on service members with dark skin). ï Ask the service member if his feet, hands, ears, or face are numb and need rewarming."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"2-12 FM 21-10/MCRP 4-11.1D ï DO NOT allow the service member to sleep directly on the ground. ï To prevent carbon monoxide poisoningó ï DO NOT let the service member sleep in or near the exhaust of a vehicle with the engine running. ï DO NOT let the service member sleep in an enclosed area where an open fire is burning NOTE Service members may check circulation in the fingers and the toes by pinching the nail beds and checking how fast the color returns in the beds under the nails. The slower the return to a natural color, the more serious the potential for frostbite on the fingers and the toes. NOTE See GTA 8-6-12 and FM 21-11 for information on cold injury first aid procedures. During extended activities in a cold environment, warming areas should be provided; for example, a service member performing guard duty."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"FM 21-10/MCRP 4-11.1D 2-13 Section III. ARTHROPODS AND OTHER ANIMALS OF MEDICAL IMPORTANCE OVERVIEW Poor sanitation and improper waste disposal under wartime conditions greatly increase the disease vector potential of such common pests as filth flies and rodents. Even in mobile field situations these ìcamp followersî have historically amplified sanitation problems, often resulting in epidemics of diarrheal diseases that have caused many casualties. This threat is even greater in urban areas converted to temporary or semipermanent military use. A dangerous temptation in field training or in deployment operations is to ignore the field sanitation standards. Some people think, ìThe rules donít apply here.î Yielding to that temptation can cost your health and the health of those around you. There is no excuse for forgetting to bring protective equipment or failing to use it. Be sure to follow all safety precautions on all labels of the pesticides that you use. They are there for a reasonóto protect your health. USE THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE INSECT/ARTHROPOD REPELLENTS The concurrent use of a skin insect repellent (N, N-diethyl-M-toluamide [DEET], NSN 6840-01-284-3982) and a clothing insect repellent (permethrin [NSN 6840-01-278-1336 and 6840-01-345-0237]) is necessary to obtain maximum protection against insects/arthropods."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"2-14 FM 21-10/MCRP 4-11.1D APPLY N, N-DIETHYL-M-TOLUAMIDE ï Apply DEET insect repellent to all exposed skin. ï Follow label directions. ï Apply a light, even coating to exposed skin, not under clothing. ï DO NOT apply to the eyes and lips, or to damaged skin. ï One application may last 8 to 12 hours; if you receive bites, reapply a light uniform coating of repellent. ï Application of DEET can be safely used with camouflage face paint. Apply a thin layer of DEET first, then apply face paint. NOTE Reapplication of DEET may be necessary (check container label) due to heavy sweating, or after river-crossing operations, exposure to rain, or in locations where arthropod density is very high."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"FM 21-10/MCRP 4-11.1D 2-15 APPLY PERMETHRIN CLOTHING REPELLENTS TO FIELD UNIFORMS/ SLEEPING EQUIPMENT ï Permethrin is the most effective clothing repellent available. ï Treat military field uniforms, including NomexÆ/Kevlar uniforms, tent liners, ground cloths, and bed nets with permethrin. This should be done before wearing in field training or military operations. Follow label instructions when applying to clothing . ï Permethrin will remain in the material after repeated washings. ï Treated uniforms can be safely worn in the rain or when crossing rivers or streams. NOTE Permethrin does not rinse out in cold water (or rain or streams). ï DO NOT apply directly to skin, to underwear, or to cap. ï DO NOT wear treated uniforms unless they are first thoroughly dried after treating. ï Apply permethrin outdoors or in well-ventilated areas only."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"2-16 FM 21-10/MCRP 4-11.1D ï Wear uniform as your commander directs. ï Wear a loose fitting uniform, not tightly tailored, to prevent arthropods from biting through the fabric; repair tears/holes. ï When the arthropod threat is highó ï Blouse pants in boots and completely lace boots. ï Tuck undershirt in at waist. ï Wear sleeves down. ï Button blouse/shirt at the neck and wrist. ï Do not use aftershave lotion, cologne, or perfumed deodorants or soaps in the field; they attract arthropods. ï Wear headgear (cap, helmet, arthropod head net) when necessary to protect your head. KEEP YOUR BODY AND UNIFORM CLEAN ï Bathe every day if possible, or at least once a week. Good personal hygiene practices reduce infestation of insects such as body lice and mites."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"FM 21-10/MCRP 4-11.1D 2-17 ï Wash your uniform frequently (a minimum of every 7 days) to remove arthropods and their eggs which may be attached to the uniform. If the situation permits, use the quartermaster laundry; otherwise, use a stream, lake, or washbasin. Air-dry uniforms, especially underwear and socks, if possible. FOLLOW MEDICAL ADVICE ï Take medications that help prevent diseases (such as anti-malaria pills) when directed by your commander. ï Use medications, such as cream/shampoo, when prescribed by medical personnel for treatment of lice, chiggers, poison ivy, and so forth. PROTECT YOURSELF AT NIGHT ï Ensure your bed net is in good repair. ï Use your bed net when sleeping. ï Tuck net under sleeping pad or sleeping bag so there are no openings."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"2-18 FM 21-10/MCRP 4-11.1D ï Follow the label directions and precautions when using DOD-approved insect spray (for example, Insecticide, Aerosol d-PHENOTHRIN, 2%) if insects are present inside the bed net (and inside closed tent). Allow vapors to disperse for 10 minutes before entering the enclosure. ï Treat bed net with permethrin for added protection. ï Repair holes in your bed net. Generously apply DEET skin repellent to those areas likely to touch the insect net during sleep (knees, hands, elbows, and feet) to prevent bites through holes in the fabric. PROTECT YOURSELF FROM OTHER MEDICALLY IMPORTANT ARTHROPODS AND ANIMALS Spiders, Scorpions, and Centipedesó ï Remove spiders from tents or buildings. ï Shake out and inspect clothing, shoes, and bedding before use. ï Eliminate collections of papers, unused boxes, scrap lumber, and metal. ï Thoroughly clean beneath and behind large items; spiders and scorpions may be resting in these areas."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"FM 21-10/MCRP 4-11.1D 2-19 ï Check field latrines before use; run a small stick under the rim of the latrine hole to dislodge any spiders or scorpions there.

DOMESTIC AND WILD ANIMALS OR BIRDS ï Do not handle or approach so-called ìpets.î ï Exclude such animals from your work and living areas, unless cleared by veterinary personnel. ï Do not collect or support (feed or shelter) stray or domestic animals/birds in the unit area, unless cleared by veterinary personnel. Section IV. POISONOUS PLANTS AND TOXIC FRUITS OVERVIEW Many poisonous plants have thorns that can puncture the skin, introduce poison into the skin, or cause infection. (See FM 21-76.) Clothing can serve as a protective barrier for"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"2-22 FM 21-10/MCRP 4-11.1D the skin. Clothing can also be a source of exposure if it is not properly cleaned after contact with poisonous plants. Toxic fruits can also cause significant harm to service members, ranging from minor wounds to rapidly fatal poisoning. The threat is magnified for US military personnel who may be unfamiliar with native species and unaware of these poisonous plants and toxic fruits. ï Avoid contact with poisonous plants by properly wearing the uniform. ï Avoid areas where poisonous plants grow. ï Only eat plants or parts of plants that have been approved. If you do not know, DO NOT eat it. ï DO NOT put grasses or woody twigs or stems in your mouth; they may be poisonous. Section V. FOOD-/WATER-/WASTEBORNE DISEASE/ILLNESS OVERVIEW Prior to deployment, the key to preventing illnesses and diseases from consumption of food and water is following the strict guidelines and procedures established by PVNTMED.
