Each of these steps is explained further as you read through the manual. 1. Make sure the area is safe. Failure to do this can lead to you becoming injured. 2. Activate the Emergency Medical System. Call 9-1-1. 3. Perform the Primary Survey (see appendix B for more detail): a. Open the airway. b. Check for breathing. c. Start CPR (and check for severe bleeding). 4. Perform a Secondary Survey: check for non-life thre atening conditions. 5. Rest and reassure the casualty. 6. Monitor and treat for shock. YOUR OWN SAFETY There is no one more important than you. This is so mething that you must keep in mind when faced with a situation where someone else needs help. Thi s is not a selfish statement; in fact it’s a selfle ss statement. It means that first you need to take car e of yourself before you can take care of anyone else. Rushing into a situation without first checki ng for safety may result in you also becoming injur ed which means you will not be able to help the other person, and you are now also a casualty. Before entering a situation you must make sure that there are no dangers that can harm you, other bystanders, or the casualty. Some of the things to check for include; • Fires or potential fires • Fumes or smoke • Falling objects • Broken glass on the floor where you’ll be leaning • Electrical wires/sources • Oncoming traffic if on the road If there are dangers you have three possible choice s. You can either go and get help immediately and not get any closer. You can move the casualty away from danger, or you can eliminate the danger if you can do so safely (e.g. open windows to expel fu mes). Remember, if you get hurt you are not going to be a ble to help anyone else."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" Visit us at www.firstaidtopics.com Page 3 ACTIVATING THE EMERGENCY MEDICAL SYSTEM Don’t hesitate to get help when someone is hurt. In most cities the best and fastest way to get help i s to call 9-1-1. By calling this number you will be a ctivating the Emergency Medical System, also known as EMS. This service will get you the police, the f ire department, and the paramedics. Although the paramedics are the best trained for medical emergen cies, all are trained to administer first aid, and can be of assistance. When activating the EMS stay calm and answer the qu estions that the dispatcher will ask. They need to know things such as where you are, what happened , how many people are hurt, and who is doing first aid. When they have finished asking you quest ions then they will tell you to hang up, don’t do s o until they are done talking to you. You can call 9-1-1 from any phone that has an outsi de line, such as a public phone, a cell phone, your home phone, your work phone, etc. If the phone you are using does not have a direct line to the outside then you may have to press a special number first, such as “9” and then dial the emergency number. If you are using a public phone it is free to dial 9-1-1, you don’t need a quarter. When using a regular land line the phone can easily be traced and the paramedics will know where you are calling from. But, just to be safe give the m your location anyway. If using a cell phone they may be able to triangulate your location but will p robably not know exactly where you are so you will have to provide this information as accurately as y ou can. If the area you are in does not have the 9-1-1 serv ice then you should know the emergency number for that area, or dial zero and go through the oper ator. Remember, stay calm and answer their questions. The EMS dispatchers are very well trained to handle these kinds of situations. Sometimes there is a fee for calling 9-1-1. But, th is will be between the EMS and the person who was injured. During an emergency you should not be conc erned with minor details; your primary concern is to help the injured person. "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" Visit us at www.firstaidtopics.com Page 4 There is no penalty for you as a rescuer for callin g the EMS, as long as you thought it was an emergency. Do not call 9-1-1 for situations which a re not an emergency. Some examples of an emergency include: • Fires • Thefts in progress • Vehicular accidents where someone is hurt • Medical emergencies ICE: this stands for In Case of Emergency. It is so mething that has recently begun and many people are doing it. In case you are injured it is really help ful for the police if they know who to contact (e.g . family members). So, on your cell phone you should label a couple of important phone numbers as “ICE” this way the police will know that these are the people are the ones to contact. Otherwise they need to sift, and possible call, many numbers on yo ur contact list. "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" Visit us at www.firstaidtopics.com Page 5 ANATOMY & PHYSIOLOGY RESPIRATORY SYSTEM This is made up of your mouth, nose, throat, air pa ssages, and lungs. The main purpose of this system is to bring fresh air into your body and the get ri d of used up air. The respiratory system can get in to trouble if the person can’t breathe properly. CIRCULATORY SYSTEM This is made up of your heart and blood vessels. Th e heart is responsible for pumping blood throughout your body. The blood contains the fresh air which was obtained from your lungs. The blood also brings used air back to the lungs to be breathed out. As you can imagine, the respiratory and the circulatory systems work very closely toget her. When there is a problem with one it usually causes a problem with the other. The heart is a very special organ. It has its own e lectrical system. It is made of a muscle called the myocardium which can transmit electrical signals. J ust like any other tissue it requires oxygen to wor k properly. The heart gets oxygen through its very ow n circulatory system called the coronary arteries. These arteries intertwine throughout the myocardium to supply the tissue with fresh oxygen. It is when there is a problem with the coronary arteries, or with the electrical system, that a person may have a heart attack. Some things that can cause a problem with the respi ratory and circulatory systems: • Choking • Allergies which cause swelling to the throat • Asthma • Hyperventilation • Heart attack • Suffocation • Smoke inhalation • Drowning • Physical injuries to the airway (mouth, throat, lun gs, ribs) • Heart attack • Strokes • Bleeding • Shock Most of these topics will be covered as we go along through the book. "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" Visit us at www.firstaidtopics.com Page 6 Some of the other body systems include: • The nervous system, which is responsible for sensin g everything around you, controlling all your movements and all your organs. • The skin, which is your protection from the environ ment. The skin also helps control your body temperature. • The immune system which protects your body from har mful pathogens. Occasionally the immune system ‘over reacts’ which can lead to anaph ylactic shock. Remember, that all systems need to function properl y. When there is a problem with one of the system it usually causes problems with the other sy stems."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" Visit us at www.firstaidtopics.com Page 7 CLINICAL & BIOLOGICAL DEATH CLINICAL DEATH This is when someone’s lungs and the heart stop wor king. Usually the lungs will stop first then shortl y after that the heart will stop as well. All living tissue in the body needs oxygen to survive. Because of this treating clinical death is vital to keeping th e organs alive. BIOLOGICAL DEATH This is when brain cells begin to die because of la ck of oxygen. Once the body does not have oxygen it takes about 4-6 minutes until brain cells begin to die. After about 10 minutes without air there is a high chance of irreversible brain damage. Notes: • Our goal as first aiders is to prevent biological d eath by getting help for the person as soon as possible, and performing CPR if the casualty become s unconscious and their breathing stops. • Remember, as first aiders we will not know if they have brain damage so we must do everything we can to help them. We are not allowed to decide if someone is biologically dead or not. Even paramedics will do everything they can to save someone, until they are told to stop by a medical doctor, which is the only one who can pronounce some biologically dead. "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" Visit us at www.firstaidtopics.com Page 8 PROBLEMS WITH THE AIRWAY AND BREATHING - ASTHMA DEFINITION • Asthma is a disease that you can be born with or de velop later on in life. Some people outgrow it as they get older. When someone has an asthma attac k their air passages become very tight, they spasm, and secrete mucous. This makes it very diffi cult to breathe. Usually breathing out may be more difficult than breathing in. CAUSES • Physical exertion, emotional stress, irritants in t he air such as dust or smoke, cold dry air, or hot humid air. WARNING SIGNS • The person will be gasping for air, there will be w heezing sounds, they will appear weak and tired, they will be anxious, and will become unconscious i f the condition worsens. HELPING • Find out if they are having an asthma attack by ask ing them. Help them take their medication. But remember that you are not allowed to administer it. All you can do is help them take it. Help them move away from the cause of the asthma attack. Activate the EMS if the medication doesn’t help or they become worst. Notes : • There are different types of medication but they al l involve spraying of the medicine into the mouth. Anyone with asthma should always be wearing their medic alert tag, and should always have their medication with them. • Children may need what’s called a spacer to assist them in taking their medication. This is a plastic tube that is attached to their puffer on on e end, and a mask on the other end. This is needed because children may not have learned yet ho w to control their breath, which is needed to inhale directly from the puffer."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" Visit us at www.firstaidtopics.com Page 9 PROBLEMS WITH THE AIRWAY AND BREATHING - HYPERVENTI LATION DEFINITION • Hyperventilation is when someone is taking in more oxygen than they really need. This causes an imbalance of the various gases in your body. Althou gh it may sound good to get in more oxygen, in fact it is not, and can cause havoc with the bre athing mechanism. CAUSES • A person may hyperventilate because of anxiety, emo tional stress, or by doing it on purpose by breathing too fast. WARNING SIGNS • The person will be breathing too fast, they will lo ok anxious, weak, tired, and they will become unconscious if the condition continues. HELPING • Help move the person away from the cause (e.g. watc hing an accident scene), talk and reassure them, have them sit down, ask them to breathe with you so they will slow down their breathing rate. If the condition continues then you need to a ctivate the EMS because this can result in unconsciousness. Notes : • Do not have them breathe into a paper bag this will only make them much more anxious. Do not leave them alone as they may become unconscious and stop breathing. "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" Visit us at www.firstaidtopics.com Page 10 PROBLEMS WITH THE AIRWAY AND BREATHING - ANAPHYLAXI S DEFINITION • An over-reaction of the body’s immune system, where different chemicals are released to try and destroy the perceived invader. CAUSES • Medication, foods (e.g. eggs, nuts, kiwis, strawber ries, sea food, etc), perfumes and soaps. WARNING SIGNS • There will be redness, hives, and itchiness in the area. There will also be swelling which can be life threatening if this is near the throat or face beca use it can restrict breathing. • Unconsciousness. HELPING • Immediately remove the person from the cause. Activ ate the EMS immediately. Assist them in taking their medication (Epi-Pen). • The epi-pen is injected in the upper thigh, where t here is plenty of tissue and blood flow. First, the top safety cap needs to be removed which allow the spring inside the tube to work once the epi-pen is thrust into the leg muscle. Once injecte d the epi-pen should be held in place for about 20 seconds to make sure all the medicine enters the tissue. • This needle is a single dose, meaning you cannot us e the same needle more than once. • If the person has a second epi-pen, do not use it u ntil the symptoms return. Notes : • Their medication will help control the swelling. Th e EMS must be activated even if they have medication because it will only last for about 10-1 5 minutes. People can develop allergies at any time throughout their lives. "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" Visit us at www.firstaidtopics.com Page 11 PROBLEMS WITH THE AIRWAY AND BREATHING - CHOKING DEFINITION • This is where something is stuck in your throat and you are having trouble breathing. It can be a partial obstruction where you can still cough and b reath, or it can be complete where you cannot breathe at all. CAUSES • Eating too fast, swallowing without chewing, laughi ng and talking while eating. For children and infants some other common causes include broken bal loon pieces, toys, and other objects that they may find lying around. WARNING SIGNS • If it’s a partial obstruction the person will be at tempting to remove the object by coughing. If it’s a complete obstruction the person will not be able to cough, they will be turning blue, they will look scared. HELPING • If it’s a partial obstruction just stay with the pe rson and encourage them to keep coughing. If you think it’s getting worse then get help. If it’s a c omplete obstruction then you need to do abdominal thrust (chest thrusts if they are pregnan t or too large for you to get your arms around them).Continue the thrusts until the objects comes out or the person becomes unconscious. Notes : • The practical components are explained further in a ppendix A. "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" Visit us at www.firstaidtopics.com Page 12 PROBLEMS WITH BREATHING The important thing to remember is that any problem s with the airway will cause a problem with breathing. And this can become life threatening. RESPIRATORY DISTRESS • This is where the casualty is still able to breathe , but is having problems doing so. RESPIRATORY ARREST • This is where breathing has stopped all together, a nd it is now an emergency. The casualty may still be conscious or may be unconscious. RESCUE BREATHING • If the casualty has become unconscious then you mus t begin CPR. Refer to appendix A for the detailed steps. "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" Visit us at www.firstaidtopics.com Page 13 PROBLEMS WITH CIRCULATION Circulation refers to blood circulating throughout the body. The major cause of circulation problems i s usually a heart attack, but can also be caused by i njury, breathing problems, shock, etc. If the perso n is not breathing than circulation will also stop, ther efore, CPR must be started as soon as possible. The practical components are explained further in appen dix A. BLOOD VESSEL DISEASE • This is sometimes referred to as coronary artery di sease, cardiovascular disease, heart disease, atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis. But, the bottom line is that it all means the same thing. DEFINITION • It simply refers to the narrowing of the blood vess els by plaque buildup. This will cause poor blood flow to any part of the body, including the h eart which can cause a heart attack, or the brain which can cause a stroke. In the case of a he art attack the blood vessels (coronary arteries) have become blocked and no longer allow blood to fl ow through to the heart muscle. As a result the heart muscles cannot function properly and will soon die. CAUSES The causes are referred to as Risk Factors. There a re two categories: • Non-Modifiable Risk Factors, meaning you cannot con trol these. They include; age, gender (male or female), type I diabetes, heredity/genetics. • Modifiable Risk Factors, meaning you can control th ese. They include: smoking, obesity, sedentary life style, high blood pressure/hypertens ion, and diet (e.g. fat/cholesterol intake). MORE ON RISK FACTORS • Age: as we get older there is a bigger risk of hear t disease simply because we’ve had more time to damage our bodies. • Gender: men have a higher chance for two main reaso ns: \u0001 Men carry excess fat higher up in the bodies which affects internal organs. The belief is that this causes higher blood sugar and higher chol esterol. \u0001 Estrogen (which men don’t have) has been shown to r educe the chance of heart disease in women. • Diabetes: this disease, over years, will cause dama ge to small blood vessels which affects circulation. This can lead to heart disease, kidney failure, blindness, and amputations."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" Visit us at www.firstaidtopics.com Page 14 • Genetics: as unfair as this may seem there are some people genetically predisposed to developing heart disease. If heart disease has been a problem with older family members then this may also be a problem for you. • Smoking: there is no doubt that smoking is harmful. What some people don’t realize is that it is not just a risk for lung cancer. The poisonous chem icals in smoking are absorbed by the blood and carried throughout the body. These poisonous chemic als cause high blood pressure, cause your arteries to become very stiff, and cause plaque to build up in the arteries. • Obesity: having excess fat puts a lot of stress on your body. It also causes high blood pressure, high triglycerides, and is associated with high sug ar levels in the blood. Losing excess fat is not easy but following a healthy eating style and being physically active is the best approach. • Sedentary lifestyle: Exercise is one of the best th ings you can do for your body. It strengthens the heart muscle, lowers blood pressure, controls exces s calories from being stored as fat, strengthens bones and muscles, etc. To stay healthy exercise sh ould be done almost daily. So, go for a walk, jog, swim, play tennis, squash, do an aerobic class , etc. Whatever you need to do to get your body moving. • High blood pressure (HBP): this is defined as the f orce the blood is exerting on your arteries as it flows through them. It is also called hypertension. If the pressure is too great the blood vessels stretch beyond their capacity which will lead to sm all cracks. These small cracks are wounds which must heal. This means that as they heal there may b e scar tissue that develops in the area which may impede blood flow. Or, if pressure is too high, the blood vessel may simply burst causing an aneurysm. Despite contrary belief there are no warn ing signs for HBP except to have it checked by your physician at least once a year. • Poor diet: most people in North America have poor e ating habits. Way too much processed, refined, and high saturated-fat foods, too much sug ar, etc. And, not nearly enough fresh fruits and vegetables. Poor diets can easily lead to high chol esterol, obesity, HBP, type 2 diabetes, etc. The more risk factors you have the higher your chan ce of developing blood vessel disease. There is no cure for blood vessel disease. That is why it is so important to start regular life style habits early on. CPR • The new 2006 guidelines state that if an unconsciou s person has stopped breathing you must begin CPR. The reason for this is that when breathi ng stops the heart will also stop soon after. So, CPR is needed to keep the blood moving throughout t he body. "},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" Visit us at www.firstaidtopics.com Page 15 HEART ATTACK WARNING SIGNS • Pain/tightness/numbness in the shoulders, arms, nec k, back, chest. • Bluish, pale skin. • Rapid but weak pulse. • Shallow rapid breathing. • Nausea or vomiting. • Unconsciousness (refer to appendix for steps to tak e). • These warning signs may come and go. Even if the wa rning signs disappear this person may still be having a heart attack and still need immediate h elp. HELPING • Help them get in a comfortable position, make sure they are resting. • Activate the EMS. • Reassure them that help is on the way. • Check for medical history of a similar problem, as they may have medication (but only assist, do not administer medication). o Angina is a condition of partial blockage of the ar teries feeding the heart muscle. If they say they have this condition then help them take th eir medication (nitroglycerin). o This medication will help dilate the blood vessels so more blood can flow through. o If they have taken any erectile-dysfunction medicat ion within the last 48 hours they should not take nitroglycerin because both medicine s have a similar affect (blood vessel dilation) which can lead to very low blood pressure , unconsciousness, and death. Ask first! • If they wish, they may take one Bayer Aspirin, as t his may prevent further damage to the heart muscle. Note, if they have asthma they may be aller gic to aspirin – ask first! • Do not give them anything to eat or drink. • Stay with them all the time and comfort them. Notes : • It is extremely common for people to ignore the war ning signs of a heart attack. Unfortunately, this is one reason why so many people die from this disease – because they don’t get help soon enough. As a first responder it is your job to acti vate the EMS as soon as possible. "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" Visit us at www.firstaidtopics.com Page 16 DEFIBRILLATION (AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATION – AED) Fibrillation is what happens in 80% of the cases wh en someone is unconscious from a heart attack. This is a condition where there is still electrical activity in the heart, but it is very irregular an d erratic. As a result, the heart is not working properly to c reate circulation. An Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is a mach ine that is designed to administer an electric shock. The concept behind this is that the shock wi ll momentarily cause the heart’s electrical system to stop, and then it will begin to work again with a regular rhythm. The main reason this works is because the heart has its own, self-sustaining, ele ctrical system. A defibrillator can detect electrical signals from the heart and determine if a shock would benefit th e person. The main factor is whether or not the heart is fibrillating. If the electrical rhythm is norma l, or there is no electrical activity at all, then the ma chine will not shock. AEDs are now becoming more common in our society, a s they have been shown to save many lives if they are used on the spot by trained bystanders, be fore the paramedics arrive. The key to this lifesaving machine is that it must be administered as soon as possible, because the casualty’s chance of being saved decreases by about 10% with every mi nute of delay. CPR is still an important component in helping someone with no signs of circu lation. How to use a defibrillator: • These machines should only be used on an unconsciou s non-breathing person. They are designed for adult and children over 25kg in weight. • Bear the person’s chest. Remove all clothing, inclu ding bras and jeweler. If needed shave the areas where the pads will be placed. • Remove the covering from the pads and place one pad on the right hand side between the shoulder and the neck, just over the collarbone. Pl ace the second pad on the left side about 3 inches below the left breast over the ribs. Look at the diagrams on the pads for more info. • Plug the pads into the machine. • Turn the machine on. • Once the machine is on follow the machine’s instruc tions fully. It will tell you exactly what to do. • First, the machine will analyze the heart’s electri cal activity. It will do this every two minutes regardless of what happens next. • If the machine detects a non-shockable rhythm then the machine will tell you to begin CPR. In the meantime it will give you a two minute count down, at which point it will re-analyze. • If the machine detects a shockable rhythm it will b egin to charge. When it is ready it will tell you t o deliver a shock. You do this by simply pushing the shock button. • Before delivering the shock make sure no one, inclu ding you, is touching the person, as this is electricity and can be very dangerous."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" Visit us at www.firstaidtopics.com Page 17 • After the shock the machine will tell you to begin CPR. In the meantime it will give you a two minute count down, at which point it will re-analyz e. • This process will be repeated to a maximum of 9 tim es. At which point the machine will not shock again. But, if needed, continue CPR until paramedic s arrive. Note: • Once the machine is on do not turn it off. • Machines record voices for learning and statistical purposes. • The battery is lithium and lasts a very long time ( usually guaranteed up to 3 years). • Machines do a daily, weekly, and monthly self tests . If there is a problem they will usually emit a beeping noise. • Most machines will have an extra set of electrical pads, a pair of scissors, and a razor. "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" Visit us at www.firstaidtopics.com Page 18 STROKE WARNING SIGNS • Numbness, tingling, paralysis on one side of the bo dy, extremities, hands, and feet. • Slurred speech, not making sense. • Trouble understanding you. • Uneven pupils. • Nausea or vomiting. • Decreased level of consciousness. HELPING • Help them get in a comfortable position on their si de, make sure they are resting. • Activate the EMS. • Reassure them that help is on the way. • Keep them warm with a blanket. • Do not give them anything to eat or drink. • Stay with them all the time and comfort them. Notes : • It is extremely common for people to ignore the war ning signs of a stroke. Unfortunately, this is one reason why so many people die from this disease – because they don’t get help soon enough. As a first responder, it is your job to activate th e EMS as soon as possible. Sometimes a stroke is called Cerebral Vascular Accident (CVA). Mini stro ke is a condition where the casualty experiences similar warning signs as that of a stro ke, but these warning signs go away on their own. This is a warning sign that a serious stroke m ay occur and the person needs medical help immediately. This condition is sometimes called Tra nsient Ischemic Attack (TIA). "},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" Visit us at www.firstaidtopics.com Page 19 SHOCK DEFINITION • Poor circulation to the vital organs. CAUSES • Dilated blood vessels, bleeding, and severe dehydra tion, all leading to a drop in blood pressure, which results in poor circulation. These can be cau sed by severe emotional trauma, physical injury, illness, etc. WARNING SIGNS • Unusual behavior (e.g. very calm or very anxious), lack of pain to an injury, rapid breathing, rapid but weak pulse, bluish skin (cyanosis), unconscious ness. HELPING • Activate the EMS right away. Assist the person to l ie on their side to improve circulation, treat any injuries, and help them take any medication for an illness. Notes : • Shock is very serious and life threatening. The cas ualty may not know that they are in shock. Stay calm, make sure they rest, and reassure them that h elp is on the way. "},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" Visit us at www.firstaidtopics.com Page 20 FAINTING DEFINITION • This is very similar to shock accept it’s a tempora ry condition. CAUSES • It usually occurs because of a temporary decrease o f blood flow to the brain, which can be caused by not eating properly, standing up too fast, or lo w blood pressure. WARNING SIGNS • The casualty feels faint, or faints. HELPING • If they feel faint have them lie down which will he lp with circulation. If they faint they will usuall y wake up in a few seconds. Encourage the person to s tay lying down for a few minutes until they feel better. If they do not wake up within one minu te, or they became injured during the fall then activate the EMS, and treat any injuries. Notes : • If someone has fainted, even if they feel fine afte rwards, they should still go see their doctor to rule out any major problems. "},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" Visit us at www.firstaidtopics.com Page 21 EXTERNAL BLEEDING DEFINITION • This is where the blood vessels and the skin are cu t and blood is escaping the body. CAUSES • Damage to the skin caused by trauma. Can be a lacer ation (clean cut), abrasion, or avulsion (with skin still hanging). Helping : • If it’s a minor bleed allow some bleeding to take p lace as this will help clean the wound. Then wash with warm water and soap, apply a dressing to keep it clean, change the dressing every few hours, and monitor for signs of infection. • If the bleeding is severe than apply the RED princi ple: • R est: make sure the person is resting so as to decre ase the heart rate and blood pressure. • E levate: raise the injured limb above the heart to s low down the bleeding. • D irect Pressure: put pressure directly over the woun d to help control bleeding, tie the dressing in place. But, do not make the dressing to o tight so as to restrict blood flow. Do not remove the dressing. Get medical help. Notes : • If there is an impaled object do not remove it as t his can cause much more injury and bleeding. Instead, apply dressing around the object then tie in place to control bleeding. Take extra care not to move the object. Refer to appendix B for bandaging techniques. "},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" Visit us at www.firstaidtopics.com Page 22 INTERNAL BLEEDING DEFINITION • This is where the blood vessels are broken but the skin is not, so the person is bleeding under the skin. Injured organs will result in internal bleedi ng. CAUSES • Usually physical trauma, being hit, falling. Very c ommon in car accidents. WARNING SIGNS • Bruising, pain, tenderness, mechanism of the injury , blood in spit, vomit, or urine. HELPING • If it’s a minor bruise on the arm or leg then rest the injured part, apply an ice pack for a few minutes, and watch for signs that it is not healing . If it’s severe internal bleeding in the core of t he body then active the EMS, make sure the person is r esting, treat for shock, apply an ice pack, but do NOT put pressure over the wound. Notes : • Internal bleeding is not always obvious, but can be life threatening. • Infection can occur with any would whether internal or external. If you suspect an infection then seek medical help immediately, as it can become lif e threatening. Watch out for warning signs such as; the wound is not healing or is getting big ger, discoloration, fluid discharge, and increased pain. "},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" Visit us at www.firstaidtopics.com Page 23 SECONDARY SURVEY This involves checking for other non-life threateni ng injuries. Obviously it is done after the primary survey, which involves looking after the life threa tening injuries. It is done by starting from the he ad and moving down to the toes while checking for bump s, bruises, bone deformity, and minor cuts. If anything is found it is treated and/or reported to the paramedics once they arrive. If the person is unconscious you do this by looking and by touching (feeling for bumps and broken bones). If the person is conscious you do this by talking t o them and asking them questions. If you think there is an injury do NOT move that bo dy part. Keep in mind that this is secondary to primary. Nev er ignore breathing problems, or CPR, or severe bleeding in order to do a secondary survey.

The fuel that your body needs is called glucose, a form of s ugar. Glucose comes from foods such as breads, cereals, pasta, rice, potatoes, fruits and some vegetables. To use glucose, your body needs insulin. Insulin is made by a gland in your b ody called the pancreas. There are two major types of diabetes: type 1, and type 2. • Type 1 diabetes is when the body makes little or no insulin. It used to be called insulin- dependent or juvenile diabetes. This requires daily injections of insulin. • Type 2 diabetes: occurs when your body can’t use th e insulin it makes. If you have type 2 diabetes, you may be able to keep your blood glucos e levels in a target range by healthy eating, exercising, and taking medication. There are 2 types of diabetic emergencies • Hyperglycemia (insulin shock): this is where there is too much sugar in the blood, and not enough insulin. It can occur by not taking medication and/ or by eating things high in glucose. • Hypoglycemia (diabetic coma): in this case there is not enough sugar and too much insulin. This can occur if too much insulin is taken or not enoug h glucose has been consumed. CAUSES • Hyperglycemia: • Eating food high in simple sugars. • Not taking medication (insulin). • Hypoglycemia: • Not eating at the right times (missing a meal). • Being over active without having planned for it. • Taking too much medication. PREVENTION • There is no way to prevent type 1. • Type 2 can be prevented by following a healthy life style of regular physical activity, healthy eating, and controlling obesity. "},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" Visit us at www.firstaidtopics.com Page 25 WARNING SIGNS • Dizziness, drowsiness, and confusion. • Rapid breathing. • Rapid pulse. • Feeling and looking ill. • Unconsciousness. HELPING • Help the person take a bit of sugar (candy, juice, fruit, etc), however, NutraSweet or aspartame is not effective. Monitor their condition and do not h esitate to call an ambulance if their condition does not improve within a couple of minutes. Do NOT administer medication; this is reserved for medical professionals only. Notes : • Diabetes is a life-long condition. High blood gluco se levels over a long period of time can cause blindness, heart disease, kidney problems, amputati ons, nerve damage, and erectile dysfunction. Good diabetes care and management can delay or prev ent the onset of these complications."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" Visit us at www.firstaidtopics.com Page 26 SEIZURES DEFINITION • Seizures are neurological disorders where the signa ls in the brain become mixed up. CAUSES • The most common cause is from the medical condition called epilepsy. However, they can also be caused by concussions, allergic reactions, brain tu mors, and high fever in children. PREVENTION • If someone has epilepsy they may have medication to take which will reduce the chance of seizures. Other causes are hard to prevent because nothing is suspected of being wrong until the seizure. WARNING SIGNS • Aside from the casualty having some kind of aura, e .g. smelling burnt toast, there are no warning signs that a seizure is about to happen. Once it be gins the person may appear totally spaced out, may appear to be sleep walking, or may be on the gr ound convulsing. HELPING GENERALIZED CONVULSIVE SEIZURES • Keep calm and let the seizure take its course. Do n ot try to stop the seizure or revive the person. • Protect person from further injury by moving hard o r sharp objects away, but do not interfere with the person’s movements. Place something soft a nd small, such as a sweater, under their head, and loosen tight clothing around the neck. • Do not force anything in the person’s mouth. This c ould cause teeth and jaw damage, or choking. The person will not swallow their tongue during a s eizure. • Roll the person on their side as soon as possible, to allow saliva or other fluids to drain away, helping to clear the airway. Do not be frightened i f a person having a seizure stops breathing momentarily. • If a seizure goes on longer than 5 minutes, repeats without full recovery, or the person becomes injured, then call for medical assistance. • Always be comforting, be gentle, and reassure the p erson, as it may take some time for them to become re-oriented.

This happens because the area builds up with more calcif ication than before. • Joint injuries usually involve a dislocation. This is where the bone has popped out of its socket. This may be accompanied with a fracture, a strain, or a sprain. It may pop back in it may not. Either way seek medical help. Do not push it back i nto place. • Tendons are strong tissues that connect a muscle on to a bone. When a tendon tears it is called a strain. They become torn they take a very long time to heal, many times never as good as before, and sometimes surgery is required to reattach them. • When a ligament is torn it is called a sprain. Liga ments connect a bone to another bone. These are found around the joints. Ligaments are very str ong, but, as with tendons, when they tear they take a long time to heal, never as good as before, and sometimes surgery is required.

It may act within a matter of seconds (e.g. carbon monoxide) or a matte r of years (car pollution). There are four basic ways in which poison can enter the body; by swallow ing, breathing, injecting, or absorbing. INGESTED POISONS Some examples can include bad food, household clean ers, perfumes, nail polish remover, etc. If the person is having trouble breathing, is convu lsing, is unconscious, or is in pain, call the EMS immediately. If the person appears to be fine but y ou want to make sure call the poison control center. For your area this number can be found at t he front of your local telephone directory. In orde r for them to help you they need to know what the per son took, how much, their age and weight, and their present condition. They will either tell you to seek medical help immediately, give them something to drink, or to monitor them to make sure they don’t get worse. Make sure you do not induce vomiting unless you are told to do so by the poison control center as some substances are corrosive and may burn on the way up. Also, do not give anything to drink unless instructed by the poison control centre as some substances may react more with drinks. Always keep cleaners and chemicals high up so children cannot access them. BREATHED/INHALED POISONS This can include fumes from household cleaners, ind ustrial products, smoke, etc. Fresh air is the immediate first aid treatment. But first make sure you are not putting yourself in danger. Seek medica l help for the person immediately. Never mix cleaners unless it specifies on the container. Never use chemicals in poorly ventilated areas. Be aware of carbon monoxide as it cannot be smelled , has no taste, and cannot be seen. It can be produced by any engine (e.g. house furnace, car), o r even a fireplace with poor ventilation. Every home should have a carbon monoxide detector. If the detector begins to sound you need to leave the house immediately and call the fire department from the neighbor’s house. Carbon monoxide poisoning makes you feel sleepy and drowsy and can have an effect in a matter of minutes so you aren’t aware of what is happening.

ABSORBED POISONS These are poisons which enter the body through the skin, but do not cause a puncture. Some examples are household cleaners, industrial product s, poisonous plants, etc. Remove the substance as soon as possible by using large amounts of running water. Do your best not to contaminate other body parts. There are some chemicals that will reac t more with water, but if you leave them on the skin they will react anyway with the skin moisture.

The rabies virus attacks the nerv ous system, and, depending on how much is transmitted, and where in the body it enters, will cause death within 3 days to about 4 weeks, if the vaccine isn’t administered soon enough. If one cont racts rabies they must get the vaccine before they experience secondary warning signs. If not, death i s imminent. WARNING SIGNS • The primary warning signs: • Getting bitten or scratched by a rabid animal. Of c ourse one won’t know for sure if the animal is rabid, so the safest thing is to assume that it is and seek medical help. • The secondary warning signs: • trouble swallowing • saliva building up in the mouth • aggressive or irregular behavior • dizziness • loss of balance • memory loss These warning signs are the same for animals and hu mans. PREVENTION • Stay away from wild animals. • If you see an animal that has wound marks, or is po rtraying warning signs listed above, call the animal control centre. • Never try and catch a wild animal, you will get bit ten for sure. HELPING • Treat the wound for bleeding and seek medical help immediately. Notes: • Even household pets, if allowed to roam outside, ca n contract rabies and bring it back in the home. • The only way to test for rabies is by killing the a nimal and testing its nervous system. • If treatment isn’t sought quick enough death is the only outcome."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" Visit us at www.firstaidtopics.com Page 43 TICKS DEFINITION These are tiny insect-like bugs that live in the wo ods and can easily fall on you as you walk by.

CAUSES Being away from medical facilities and not having t ransportation is the most common cause for this situation. WARNING SIGNS If the mother says, “the baby is coming,” or the ba by’s head is showing, or the contractions are less than two minutes apart, then it is time to deliver the baby on the spot. HELPING Although it is very easy to panic in such a situati on keep in mind that giving birth is natural and ha s been done for thousands of years, even before hospi tals were created. As a rescuer here’s what you should do: • Make sure the EMS has been called. • Make the mother comfortable on her back. Remove any necessary clothing but keep her covered to protect her privacy. Put some clean towels under her. • As a rescuer all you have to do is support the baby as it comes out. Hold the head as it is heavy compared to the rest of the baby. • As soon as you can see the baby’s throat make sure the umbilical cord is not wrapped around it. If it is use your finger to loosen it and pass it over the head. This is easy to do. • Once the baby comes out wrap it in a clean towel. • Clean its mouth and nose. • If it is not breathing massage its back and tickly its feet. This should help stimulate the breathing mechanism. • If it is still not breathing begin rescue breathing and CPR. • Never hold the baby upside down and slap it. This i s a TV thing, and if you should drop the baby you’ll be in trouble. • If the baby is fine give it to the mother to hold. • The other end of the umbilical cord will be attache d to the placenta which will still be inside the mother. Do not pull, it will come out on its own in a few minutes in another set of contractions. • Do not cut the cord. Simply wrap the placenta in a towel and keep with the baby."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" Visit us at www.firstaidtopics.com Page 46 • Never put the placenta lower than the baby as blood may drain from the baby back into the placenta.

WAKE THEM UP • Gently try to see if they can respond by calling ou t to them and gently tapping their shoulders. 9-1-1/EMS • If they don’t wake up (or if they are injured) you or someone else must activate the EMS. AIRWAY • Place them on their backs, carefully so as to not c ause any injury. • Open their airway by tilting their head back and li fting their chin upwards. This will remove the tongue from blocking the airway. Keep the airway op en. BREATHING • Check for Breathing by looking, listening, and feel ing for air (10 seconds). • If they are breathing then monitor and put them in the recovery position until the paramedics arrive. • If they are not breathing give them 2 breaths, allo wing the air to come out in between. • If the air goes in then go to “Circulation.” • If the air does not go in, re-position the head-til t/chin-lift a bit further back and try blowing agai n. • If the air still does not go in then go to “Circula tion” but check the mouth for the food after doing CPR. CIRCULATION • Start CPR if needed (compressions and breaths). • It is 30 compressions to 2 breaths. Continue until paramedics arrive or until something changes with the person (reassess at this point). • If the air was not going in make sure you check the mouth, to see if the food came out, after each set of compressions. If you see the object in their mouth, take it out and reassess breathing. CONSCIOUS CHOKING ADULT OR CHILD "},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" Visit us at www.firstaidtopics.com Page 48 • Ask them if they are choking. • Ask them if you can help. • Step behind them and do abdominal thrusts (chest th rusts if they are big or pregnant). • Continue until the food comes out or until they bec ome unconscious. • If the food comes out make them comfortable and act ivate 9-1-1 if they need it. • If they become unconscious; • Lay them down. • Activate 9-1-1. • Check their mouth for the food. • Follow the ABC steps above. CONSCIOUS CHOKING INFANT • Lay them on your arm face down and give 5 back blow s. • Turn them over face up and give 5 chest compression s. • Continue until the food comes out or until they bec ome unconscious. • If the food comes out make them comfortable and act ivate 9-1-1 if they need it. • If they become unconscious; • Lay them down. • Activate 9-1-1. • Check their mouth for the food. • Follow the “Unconscious Casualty” steps above. HEAD/TILT-CHIN/LIFT • This is done so as to lift the tongue off the throa t so as to open the airway. It is done by placing one hand on the forehead and pushing the head back, and by placing on finger on the underside of the chin and lifting the chin upwards. • If you suspect a neck injury then you should open t he airway using the modified jaw thrust, without the head tilt. TONGUE-JAW LIFT • This is done when you want to see if there is food inside an unconscious person’s mouth. • It is done by opening their mouth and grabbing thei r tongue (like a tongue depressor) with your thumb. Now you can see inside their mouth. • If you see an object, then use the other hand to pu ll it out. • Never put any foreign objects, e.g. tweezers, insid e their mouth to pull out the object. • If the object is liquid or hard to get out, turn th e person on their side and try scooping it out from this position. "},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":" Visit us at www.firstaidtopics.com Page 49 APPENDIX B BANDAGING Bandaging is something you would do to control seve re bleeding. Ideally you want to use sterile dressing, however, when someone is bleeding severel y you may have to use whatever you have near you (e.g. towels, clothing). The idea is to put pre ssure over the cut, with a dressing, to control bleeding, and tying the dressing in place. You want to tie with enough pressure to control the bleedin g but not so much so that blood does not get through to the remainder of the limb. If you restrict blood flow that area may die and may require amputation, so be very careful. As you are tying the dressing ask the injured person to make sure you are not mak ing it to tight. Once you’ve tied the dressing you need to check to make sure you did not make it too tight, and check this every couple of minutes. For example, if you’ve bandaged a forearm here’s how yo u check for circulation: Compare both hands to make sure they are similar in temperature and color. • Check the hand to make sure it is not swelling or t urning blue. • Ask the person if the hand feels numb or tingly. • If they lose sensation then it’s too tight. Do not remove the bandage but loosen it a bit. • If the first dressing becomes soaked with blood the n simply put another one on top. Do not remove the original one as you will be reopening th e wound. Notes: • Always use caution when dealing with bodily fluids. Wear gloves and wash your hands immediately after. • Keep in mind that the injured person may go into sh ock. SLING A sling is something you use to keep the hand/arm e levated above the heart and to make it more secure and comfortable for the injured person. It s hould only be used if it does not cause more pain o r discomfort.

It shoul d only be done if paramedics are going to take a long time arriving, or if you have to move the person. Never move or try to realign the injured body part. Always splint in the position found. There are three main types of splints: Anatomical: this means using a non-injured body par t to immobilize an injured body part. E.g. to splin t a broken left lower leg you would tie both legs tog ether so the good leg provides support to the injured leg. 1.
