Our intention is to give you an idea of the realities of daily life – what to expect, and at least some of the changes you may go through if you choose to live the survivalist/self-sufficient/off- grid/prepper lifestyle. We've made it. We live on a 40 acre ranch within a huge working cattle ranch in the mountains of New Mexico, in a house we built by ourselves, living a life of somewhat physically hard but extremely rewarding daily work, connected to nature and working on our personal enlightenment. People are waking up in exponential numbers to the fact that their current cushy, urban/suburban, comfy lifestyle may not be around in the very near future and that maybe it's a good time to make a change to one of more self-sufficiency. Better late than never. But our family has been making this change and working toward this goal for well over 20 years and have had the luxury of making the necessary adjustments incrementally. Frankly, we feel sorry for those who now have to make them all at once, or who will go back into “society” with their tail between their legs – and the vast majority will be the latter case. This is not just a how to book. There are plenty of books, Internet sites, talk shows and know-it-alls who will tell you how to become a survivalist – technically . They will tell you their way to build a house out of rocks and © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 5 –"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"mud, how to make your own solar panels, how to cook on a wood stove, how to garden, etc., etc., etc. Most of this is very good information. But we have yet to find anyone who will also tell you what it takes gut-wise , i.e., psychologically – the mental and emotional changes you will go through to be successful in this lifestyle. One reason for this is that many people who call themselves “experts” at living off the grid and away from society, don't live the life themselves. The author of one of the most popular websites on off-grid living actually lives in London. The author of many works on surviving whatever Planet X may bring lives in Orange County, CA and suggests that you do what the government tells you to do because they have your best interests at heart. We are here to tell you what it was like making all the psychological adjustments to the physical changes that this lifestyle requires, as well as practical ways to live this lifestyle. We was blessed with being different than most in that we could see the bullshit behind the “norm” of society at a very early age. We understood how the world really works, who pulls the strings and why, and what the bigger picture portends. We agreed when we decided to share our life 25 years ago that our yet-to-be-conceived children would not attend public schools (nor private ones for that matter) and that, having the luxury of our trade not relying on where we lived, we would live as remotely as practical and possible, seeing where the road would take us. That road eventually led us to a 40 acre parcel in New Mexico, in one of the last truly open range areas (all the free manure we could ever want), where we built our own house out of cinder block and the abundant local adobe © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 6 –"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"clay in our late 50s with our 20 year old son (more like we helped him ), and where we expect to stay as the world as we know it falls apart so that a better paradigm can come to fruition. Although many of the things that alerted us 25 years ago to the coming demise of society are now abundantly apparent, suffice it to say that 25 years ago to even broach the subject among the still-blinder-ed folk on topics such as the fiat money system, the dangers of the social welfare state, imperialism and wars was only going one place, would have you labeled as a “tin-foil-hat-wearing kook” and find you immediately dismissed. We've made many, many costly mistakes along the way (and still were successful), and we intend that by reading this book you may be able to avoid some that we've had the luxury of time to repair. After closing our successful business, after we had been on the land for a while and living off our storage foods, after “living the life” for a while, we realized that there were still some loose ends we needed to tie up in the areas of replenishing things we used more than we thought we would in our planning. We also were altruistic enough to believe that there were other people like us who knew that it was time to separate ourselves from society, but who didn't have the 20+ years we had to find their own Shangri-La. So, being the entrepreneurs we are, we decided to lease off parts of our 40 acres. We didn't need all that space and we thought that it would be good to have other people like us (we didn't realize how unique we really were) join us in a community for better chances of survival. © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 7 –"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"It was through this leasing process that we discovered the true variations of those who call themselves survivalists, but who are mostly “wanna be's” or, more correctly, “scared to be's”. Scared-to-be's feel that itch in the back of their minds, telling them that a drastic change is needed, but they only want to investigate making the change long enough to find a good enough reason NOT to make the change for real. On this road of living the survivalist/self-sufficient life, we have met dozens of interesting, even diabolical people and seen amazing weather, majestic mountains, beautiful wildlife, but most importantly, we found peace of mind and tranquility. It takes only a sincere desire to stop beating your head against a brick wall for the pain to stop. We know this because we have lived both lifestyles – and we prefer this one wholeheartedly. This morning after breakfast we were going to need 10 cups of flour to make bread. In this REAL world that we live in, she wasn't asking someone to run to the corner store to buy flour. She was asking to get out the hand-crank grain mill and the red wheat berries and grind them into the flour we needed to make our bread today. So this morning's “work obligation” consisted of 60 minutes of grinding red wheat into flour. We're sure this is more exercise than most get on a cardio machine. It's certainly more gratifying. In the current paradigm, or what we here like to call “the outside world”, most of your worries are external to you. By this we mean your mortgage, your insurance payment, getting the next cool gadget because your neighbor has one. But done properly, these will not exist in your survivalist world. © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 8 –"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"As an old friend of ours, used to say, “Life is so daily.” What he meant by this was that the tasks we perform in life become our daily devotion. In the self- sufficient life, your daily devotions are entirely internal to you, that is, they affect you directly. Tending the goats and chickens, taking care of the greenhouse and gathering wood are all directly for your own daily bread, not to make someone else richer. As you read this book you may notice that it is written from a completely different perspective than you currently have – and that's a good thing. We have attempted – and believe we have achieved – to help you understand what actually living this survivalist/self-sufficient/off- grid/prepper lifestyle is really like on a daily basis, regardless of what does or does not happen in the “outside world”. © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 9 –"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Chapter 1 Where is Your Head? We don't mean this in the terms of the 60's saying. We mean, what do you really believe? Nine out of ten people we've met who expressed an interest in being a survivalist or prepper, I have to say, frankly did not know their own mind. Like being at the poker table, to win you must either be all in, or don't bother playing. You can't get to home plate if you keep one foot on third base. Often the problem comes in not with someone's own head, but with the heads of people they are attached to – wives, children, mothers, fathers, pets, friends, bosses, mild acquaintances. We could recount endlessly the amount of times we met people who were conflicted by others, who vainly labored at – or sought others to labor at – convincing their son, daughter, dog, cat, minster, rabbi, imam, boss, wife, husband that they should join in the bug-out. Truth is, everyone of the aforementioned entities has a strong vested interest in keeping you in the system. It is like asking a butcher if it's good to eat meat. If you discuss with people your desire to drop out of society – those entrenched in society, even those at the lowest echelons of society – it gives them permission to validate their own choices through you. And believe me, they will do everything in their power to prove you wrong so that they can validate their own decisions – or because they are too afraid of the changes coming to admit that their comfy life may not be around tomorrow. And in case you feel a need to give it a try, don't bother trying to convince anyone else that your decision is © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 10 –"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"right, either. It won't work and it will only lead to hard feelings with what once were your friends, relatives and acquaintances. If you seek Nirvana, you seek to know yourself. Your “self” is a solitary, singular word. If you are fortunate enough to have a significant other who agrees with you on the need to get to a survivable location and live a neo- primitive lifestyle, you are very lucky. But most personal set backs by those trying to achieve this lifestyle are related to family relations. So we'll take it on face value that you are reading this book to find out how YOU can achieve this lifestyle. First and foremost, be honest with yourself and others who may be considering going with you. Countless times we have seen a wife who wanted to do this and hoped by some miracle that didn't necessarily involve them actually doing anything that her husband would suddenly be on the same page as she was. That is a pipe dream. If you feel strongly a certain way (and in this case that way is to become a neo-primative survivalist) then for God's sake please discuss it honestly with your spouse. Innumerable times a wife or husband would schedule a visit (when we were leasing off parts of our ranch as survival retreats) in the hopes that we would somehow convince their reluctant spouse. Every time we have been asked to do that for someone, we have flatly refused. On the face of it, it's dishonest. This lifestyle is hard and any problems you had in the outside world, vis a vis, your honesty with each other, will become intensified when you have no outside distractions to mask them. A lack of honesty will turn into outright visceral resentment. This is also true of any other shortcomings your relationship may © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 11 –"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"suffer from. So having a heart-to-heart with whomever you plan to have join you and coming to terms with it is your first step. You notice I am not convincing you that you need to do this. We presume you understand that. Your biggest bug-a-boo is who you bring with you, not what. In this circumstance, it is all about compromises. If two people really care for each other, then in any discourse there is give and take. Find your happy medium and create an intention that it be successful, then take action to see to it that it is. To be fair, it is also a consideration towards those relationships that you are better off without. I can't tell you what they are, but deep down inside of you, you already know. The real question you have to ask yourself is, “Is this relationship worth dying for?” Of course this presupposes that you do not see a good end for this current world manifestation in the near future. These are questions that will help you know your head and find your center. It is also a rational decision to stay in the outside world with those you love knowing that you may very well die there. You will get no greasy-eyed looks from me about it...I salute you. It takes balls to make either decision. To decide to stand with those whom you love is admirable. For them to decide to live with you is also admirable. But make a decision – one way or the other – and then make that reality. Consider these in your dialogue with your family and friends; 1. Be honest – about what you feel, what you want, your motivations. I know for some of you this will be nearly surreal © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 12 –"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"because you may have never done it before. But you may be pleasantly surprised that honesty, especially in this case, works best of all. 2. Don't sensationalize. Many a spouse has taken the liberty to use questionable facts and outright bullshit to get their spouse to agree to a lifestyle change. There is a property to bullshit that needs to be considered. Most people can smell it coming off your lips. So don't sensationalize. Ask yourself if you would like to make a life-change decision based on bullshit and sensationalized facts. How would you feel when you found out it was bullshit? This can create problems down the road, so don't create any minefields to convince someone else that you are right. It's an easy pitfall to avoid. 3. Decide beforehand who is worth telling and who is not. Far too often people use people who mean little to them or people to whom you mean little as the first ones to approach about your lifestyle- change decision. WRONG, WRONG, WRONG!!!!! Earl Nightingale gives us excellent advice on this topic... (paraphrased) don't bother discussing your goals with those not intimately involved with those goals. They will shoot you down every time and destroy your ego. Only discuss your goals with those who are intimately involved with them or who you © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 13 –"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"love. So don't use the guy who sits next to you in the subway or the guy you casually have lunch with to discuss your plans. Make a list of those who would be directly involved with your decision and talk only with them about it. Saying you have everything ready is a misstatement for most. The most important place to have ready is your mind. Some of you say that you can't wait till you no longer have to wait in line at Starbucks, or fight the traffic to get to your cubical at your job, but all those activities in the pop culture world create neural-synaptic connections that become your current addictions. Most of our addictions are consumer addictions. The rituals – vis a vis going to Starbucks or walking around the mall – are deep-seated in our brains through what scientists call a neural-synaptic connection. These connections become warm, fuzzy, homey feeling. That's what they are designed to do. Nobody really pays $8 for a cup of coffee with cream for the coffee or the cream. They are paying for the feeling they get when they do it. © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 14 –"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"If you truly want to be successful in the survivalist lifestyle, you need to begin now breaking old patterns or prepare for the culture shock of your life. We have seen this undo people more than any other cause – more than money, more than physical hardships, more than lack of ability. The culture shock is your real enemy. Most people, when told this, slough it off and usually say something like, “Oh, that won't be a problem for us, we're already out of the system,” when what they mean is, “I only buy organic foods at the supermarket.” It takes much more than that. Our advice to someone considering the self-sufficient lifestyle is to begin now breaking patterns. Patterns to Break: • dependency on alcohol, tobacco, illicit drugs, sugar drinks, etc. • watching TV • shopping as entertainment (Wal-mart, supermarkets, etc) © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 15 –"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"It's not only about your head, but also about the heads of those you care for and love. Now, understand this. For you to be successful in changing from an urban/suburban you must truly believe that this is the way to go. You have to believe in yourself, and you have to believe that there will be a future that will be better than the paradigm we have now. You have to believe it so deeply that it won't matter when people tell you you're crazy – and they will. Not everyone is meant to understand what is happening in the world today – even some family members will not wish you well in your endeavors.

If you're expecting a sales pitch on why you should be a survivalist, you won't get one here. For most of you, your reason for wanting to know more about survival is enough. Some of you want to know what to do “just in case” and others are just tired of being in a system that considers you a resource to be exploited, and still others believe in the Myan prophesies from the Popul Vu, Planet X, the Bible and other ancient wisdoms. It makes no difference what your motivations are, the end result is the same – knowing that there is something wrong out there and that never seems to get corrected. The reasons for your adventure are yours to conjure.

Just a look at a few web pages should give you all the motivation you'll ever need. You can find your own reason to bug out of society – war, famine, dollar collapse, civil unrest, collapsing infrastructure, weather changes, pole shift – take your pick. If you need someone to convince you then you are choosing not to be awake. You are deluding yourself if you think things will just get better from here. Who Really Lives in Fear? Many people excuse themselves from self- reliance/ survivalism by saying, “I don't want to live my life in fear,” assuming that we are here in our retreat because we fear the outside world. What they don't understand is that they are the ones living in fear day in and day out, but in living with it every day, it's hard to notice. Answer this honestly – why do you buckle your seat belt? Is it because you are going to have an accident today and you think it will prevent you from injury? Does it protect you any better than an air bag does? There are © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 18 –"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"times when a seat belt is a detriment to the accident victim. If you are honest, you buckle your seat belt because that is the price you pay to drive on the highways, even city streets, even rural roads, without being stopped and harassed by the local or state police and given an expensive ticket. You fear the consequences of not buckling your seat belt in order to drive or be a passenger on the public roads. Why do you not make a joke in the airport? Is it because you have no sense of humor? Or is it because you are afraid that someone will be listening and call the “See something/Say something” hotline?

When you truly disconnect from society, that's when you have lost the fear. When you know that you can depend on yourself, no matter what happens, that's when you have lost the fear. With the very delicate state of the world – geo-politics, economic collapse, strange weather, threat of war on a global scale set to break out at any moment – the real issue is not selling you on why to do this. The real issue is, will you be one of the rare ones who see the storm coming and prepares or one of those who gets it at the very last minute and sees the need to prepare too late. Suffice it to say that no one can or should talk you in to this life style. You are the only one who can do that. But if your reading includes books like this one, then it should be safe to say that you do understand the need to prepare and are looking for ways to accomplish that. © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 20 –"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 Reasons Not to Prepare This article first appeared on The American Dream website.

To be reminded by an external source that you have made the right decision can be a relief, as world events should make abundantly clear soon enough. We (as in society) make it too easy for those trying to control the majority of the population. For the most part we already control each other. We attempt to make small changes in our lives to constructively avert control and the controllers need not do anything that our peers won't execute more promptly for them. The “troublemaker” is expelled from urban/suburban society and he then keeps himself under control. “If I tell the neighborhood that they're all being lied to and are in grave danger, I won't be invited to Jim's barbecue.” This poor mind decides never to wake up entirely and take appropriate action for the reason of trivia such as “What © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 26 –"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"will the neighbors think?” This is a very old paradigm losing it's relevance fast.

Not that the cabin was a bad place, not that it was unclean, but it was just a big room (16' by 32') that contained a wood cook stove, a counter top with a sink, a dining room table and our bed. The bathroom was also quite primitive, a 4' by 8' area containing an RV toilet and a hole in the floor for the shower water to drain. There were no luxuries – like running water or paint on the plywood – but we were quite proud of what we had built with our own hands and it gave us good shelter for 2 years while we built the charming adobe house we now live in. The domestics' horror was brought on by confusing opulence – or even luxury – with value . Don't let others who don't understand the difference make you feel inadequate. Frankly, we feel sorry for those who don't understand that the freedom gained by living this lifestyle is worth giving up a luxury or two.

By far their favorite is “for the children”. Our daughter, who never had a social security number, went to get a passport. She told us that the people at the passport office actually seemed scared of her because she did not have a SSN. What on earth could possibly be frightening about not having an SSN at 18 years old?

The Army's stated plan for when that time comes (yes – they have a plan) is to isolate the urban and suburban areas by choking off critical roads – Interstates, State roads, etc. This means that most people will be stuck in urban and suburban areas, like it or not. Some people, though, will get out and be looking for a place to land – or a place to take over. We're talking about the possibility of some real “desperadoes” here. © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 55 –"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"You don't want to be in a place where some gang can happen upon your survival spot by accident. For most, the general rule should be at least 100 miles away from large cities and the potential of marauding hoards. Our place is over 20 miles from even a paved road and a good part of the dirt road is “primitive” – very rocky and pretty scary for city-folks. There is nothing but some cattle drinker wells between us and the paved road. So a gang or even a sole individual would have to know for a fact that it was worth taking the trip to see if we were “pushovers” and if we had anything here worth his while. Just to get to the dirt road requires a trip of about 30 miles from even the smallest town. We're almost 200 miles from a major city, which would be where a gang might come from. They couldn't even get enough gas to make the whole trip here if they were driving, let alone being able to walk here. And if they did bother to make the trip, they'd have to be sure that they were not going to face someone who knew how to defend themselves. In itself, our location is a big deterrent. © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 56 –"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Some people think that if they are in a “rural” area (something less populated than suburbia) they are in a good place for survival. What is mostly available in these areas is a place in a “subdivision” (sometimes called a “development”) where you can get a 5 acre lot for somewhere around $20,000. It's very attractive to someone from a city. It gives the illusion of being “away from the world” to those who are not quite comfortable about being very remote. But we tend to call these subdivisions “suburbia with bigger lots”. On our journey to find the right spot for ourselves, we wasted lots of time and effort and LOTS of money in subdivisions. What we found – © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 57 –"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"without exception – was that these subdivisions are overwhelmingly populated with those living in one form or another off government checks (Social Security, Welfare, VA Disabilities, etc.) and waiting for next month's check to stock up on beer and alcohol, cigarettes, Mountain Dew and – only if they had enough left over – some prepared or “junk” foods. In addition they were dependent on the medical system for their Prozac, Viagra and Oxycodone prescriptions. In some of the subdivisions in which we lived, within the span of a year the population tripled. Here's what often happens: Your daughter's husband is out of work and they, along with their bratty kids need to move in with you. Then you remember that you have an RV on one of these 5 acre lots in a subdivision where you planned to retire someday but rarely visit. Hey! Your daughter and her family can go live there rather than your house! We know personally of several situations like this in which these down-on -their-luck families find it a good opportunity to steal whatever they can from the rest of the population in the subdivision. The week after we sold and moved out of one subdivision, someone came along and stole the solar panels we had left for the new owner from the roof of the house! They didn't know the new owner had already installed a video camera to watch the property. Even the nicest people's grown kids were involved. It was only because we were pretty much always home that our own property was not bothered.

It will be worse than if you had stayed in suburbia, where the Army will at least give you hope that “the situation is well in hand.” Subdivisions and developments often have pages and pages of “covenants” – rules about what kind of building can be erected on your land, how long you can live in an RV on your land, what kind of livestock you can have on your land and on and on. And they usually have a “homeowners' association” to make sure the rules are followed and new ones added. Another word about subdivisions. It is the ideal setting and a magnet for “meth chefs”, people who manufacture methamphedimines in their homes. No one nearby savvy enough to know what that smell really is, no one close enough to see what's going on, and not a lot of police in the area.

Your choice of gun and ammo are are important. I know that many of you already have your choices of weapons in your gear. This is for those who have not made those choices. Your weapon should be able to be carried in the pack along with the ammo. This may limit your choices of weapon to a pistol, but the Ruger 10/22 is also a possibility.

What you are looking for is REAL RURAL PROPERTY. It won't be easy getting a real estate agent to be creative and find land not in a subdivision, so insist that he or she not waste your time. Keep looking until you find the right agent, or look for sellers directly on the Internet (ebay and cragslist are good places to look). Our ideal – and where we settled – is a county of over 7500 square miles. That's bigger than most of the states in Southern New England combined. The year round population of this county is under 2500, making the population density less than one person per square mile. Thats a good ratio. You may not be able to achieve that but try to keep the number at less than 6 people per square mile. Many people become very insecure living in a place that EMTs do not service, or living on a poorly maintained dirt road that is over 30 miles long. Fear keeps them away, and that is something you can use to your advantage. If you are planning a survival retreat somewhere, the fact that the Sheriff only comes if someone is shot and dying and EMTs dare not tread is just what you are looking for. Here in our county in New Mexico, it is a requirement that all home owners own a firearm. This is because there is one Sheriff and 4 Deputies to cover the entire 7500 © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 67 –"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"square mile county.

Frankly, that's the way a real survivalist would rather have it anyway. If the land you are considering is difficult to get to, that's a plus. You don't want it to be impossible to get to, but difficult is ok. That's a deterrent to marauding gangs as we discussed in a previous chapter. You'll probably want to be able to get to a town at least once in a while to pick things up here and there until things totally collapse. © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 68 –"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"When we do make a grocery run, we patronize the local small grocer rather than the great big supermarkets. The selection of foods is modest and the prices are just slightly higher than the big markets. But if you need something special, or if you forgot to fill your checkbook and need some short-term credit, you get to talk to the owner who is glad to offer extra customer service – not some flunky who can only do what the corporate rules say he can do. So when you are land hunting, stop in at some of the local retailers and see how you feel about them. Water availability is a big consideration, especially here in the Southwest. This doesn't necessarily mean that the land you are considering must have its own well already. There may be a natural water source nearby that you can take advantage of, or the rainfall patterns allow you to collect enough water, or there may even be a water delivery service – I'm not talking about the “Culligan © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 69 –"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Man” bringing you 5 gallon bottles of tap water, I mean someone local who will deliver a tanker truck load of well water for your water storage tank(s).

The average cost to dig a well in this area is $22 per foot, and that includes the casing pipe. You'll still need a pump and a power source. Another consideration would be the property tax rate and the ability to pay those taxes somewhat in advance. The property taxes on our 40 acres, before improvements is $24 PER YEAR. Yes – twenty-four dollars per year ! After we put a house on the land they went all the way up to $94 per year. Yes – ninety-four dollars per year ! Granted, we don't have a lot of amenities here, and it costs $75 per year for a permit to dump garbage in the county dumpsters, but it suits us just fine. Find out what – if any – building codes, building permit requirements, etc., are applicable for the land you are considering. In this area, because we are on ranch land there is no requirement for building permits, nor restrictions on what kind of building can be erected. Also, according to NM State © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 70 –"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"law, if we do not use any licensed contractors in our construction, building codes may not need to be followed.

A land contract is not a mortgage, it is a contract between the buyer and seller that you pay monthly until the contract is paid off, often through an escrow company. In this area and other very rural areas of New Mexico, banks simply will not give mortgages to purchase property. So if someone wants to sell property out here, they have to be willing to allow for a land contract or sit and wait for someone who can come up with the entire purchase price in cash. It's quite secure for the seller since, if the contact is not paid as agreed the seller gets to keep the monies paid and sell the property all over again. On the face of it, a land contract is no different than a mortgage. Land contracts are simple and usually easier to get – most of the time there is no credit check and the biggest thing needed is the down payment (typically 10% of the purchase price). Often the interest is simple interest rather than amortized, and they generally have a shorter term (5 to 15 years) with lower payments than a mortgage. With a mortgage, if you fail to pay the bank it will have to foreclose on you. This legal process can take months, even years. With a land contract you can be evicted from the property as it is stated in the contract. Most contracts have a clause that states failure to make the monthly payments constitutes default and in 45 days you can be evicted. © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 72 –"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"It is also easier to renegotiate the terms, since the owner doesn't want to have to go through reselling the property if it can be avoided.

At the time our pay-off would have been about $14,000. The seller agreed to a lump-sum payment of $8000, which really helped! Try doing that with a bank mortgage. © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 73 –"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Chapter 14 Funding For most of you – let me guess – you'll say that you don't have the resources to make this lifestyle change. But that may not be entirely true. The differences between the survivalist life style and the worldly lifestyle is very great. Many of the things you have that have value in the outside world are nearly worthless to the survivalist. Some of the items that are worthless here are, first and foremost, high-wattage electrical devices. These include toasters, toaster ovens, blenders, high definition TVs, exercise equipment, laser printers and most things that are commonly used in the suburban lifestyle. For our daily use we have • a laptop computer that can also play DVDs and music, an Internet connection (see Satellite Internet ) consisting of a modem and a wireless router so we can all be on the Internet simultaneously • a AAA through D size battery charger that works on 12 volts DC, and • our much loved Grundig YachtBoy 400 radio (we can pick up Coast to Coast A.M. ) that uses AA batteries that we charge on the 12 volt DC battery charger. Thats it for electrical items now. In our old life we had two SONY Wega flat screen TV's, a 100 watt stereo system, the kids had the latest video games – you know, the typical suburbanites.

Part of the self- sufficiency mindset is knowing when you have enough – and that's a big threat to the consumerist paradigm. If you are trying to gather money to make the change, you may have a good chunk of what you need in the stuff you're not going to bring with you. Yard sales are still a great way to gather the money hidden in your household items. Craigslist and ebay (use local pickup on ebay for larger items) and those type of Internet sites are also very good to sell off the excess items that have no value in the survivalist life. Ebay and Craigslist can also be used to research prices of comparable items so that you will have an idea how to price your items.

If you are considering a trust, please seek legal advice from a attorney. This is simply a recounting of what we learned from what we did. If you are like most true survivalists, you are not buying a survival retreat for its future appreciated value. (Although we have seen people do just that.) But if you want your place to be your permanent residence, placing your land holdings into a land trust may be right for you. A land trust is an excellent way to keep your haven safe from prying eyes and anyone who may want to sue you. What a trust does is create a privacy hedge around you and your assets. In most states, creating a revocable land trust is very easy to set up. Look up private paralegal services in your area. Paying a lawyer for this service can cost several hundreds or even thousands of dollars, but most paralegals have a word processing document that they or you can just fill in the blanks and is much less expensive. Basically, the assets named in the trust (typically the land and all improvements, vehicles and any other assets you wish to include) are moved from your legal possession to becoming a possession of the trust as a separate entity. Sort of how executives are not held personally responsible for any shortcomings or wrongdoings of a corporation.

No action can be taken for which there is not unanimous consent, so the other beneficiaries cannot sell the land, for example, with out your consent and the consent of all other beneficiaries. The trustee is basically the caretaker of the trust in that they ensure that the property taxes are paid, etc.. Basically, the trustee follows the directions of the beneficiaries. The trust documents are kept by the people in the trust and are not filed anywhere except among the people involved in the trust. So if there are 4 people involved in a trust only those 4 people know who is named in the trust and it would take a court order for an outsider to find out who is named in that trust. Anyone wanting to know the identities of the beneficiaries would first need probable cause to even ask for that information. Suffice it to say that most litigious lawyers see a trust and lose interest real quick. You are not required to tell anyone who is involved in the trust. Its a great way to make your self invisible and what lawyers call “ JUDGEMENT PROOF ”! The only part of the trust that is recorded is the transfer (grant) of the deed from you to the trust (as an entity) and is recorded in your county.

This has been the most – ahem – “interesting” part of our journey, by far! By the time we had purchased our land, built a temporary shelter and lived the life for a couple of years, we found that we were in need of a few more supplies, some things needed replenishing (we had had time to determine what we actually used more than other things in living the lifestyle) and we decided upon what we wanted and could accomplish for a permanent house. That meant we needed another influx of cash. We had sold off our business, but still had a small cash flow from some books we had written. But that would not be enough to put the finishing touches on our paradise. We had purchased 40 acres and we knew we didn't really need all that land for ourselves. (We were lucky enough to get such a small parcel of such remote land – it's usually sold in “sections” of 160 acres.) We also thought that it would be good to be not quite so solitary – if we could find others that we could “tolerate” as neighbors. We thought that a small community would have a better chance of survival when TSHF, and we certainly had a good place to develop that. We also believed that there were others who understood where society was headed, but who hadn't had the opportunity to take the 20+ year journey we took to find the right place. So we decided to offer portions of our land for long- © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 80 –"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"term (5 to 99 years) lease.

Whether you are considering starting your own survivalist community or joining one, caution is urged. When we were starting our survivalist community we met con men, thieves, liars, bankruptcy cheats, VA Disability cheats, Social Security Disability cheats, child support cheats, and even someone under indictment for 2 nd degree murder who was looking for a place to lam it if things didn't go his way. As much as I would like to tell you that there is an Internet service to do background checks, you need to understand that that is superficial at best.

They want to “investigate” the lifestyle – but just deeply enough to discover the excuse they need as to why they shouldn't make the change. Survival Tourists may also use visiting a survival community like someone would visit a zoo. They want to “gawk at the provincials” and say to themselves, I'm so glad I don't have to live like that! (See the chapter, There But For the Grace of God Go I? ) They don't have a clue – or at least can't admit to themselves – that things are about to change. They can't face it and they don't believe in their own capabilities, so they'll just go a long to get along. That's their choice. One couple from Southern CA asked to come for a weekend to visit and see what we were offering for lease. Once they got here, their interest centered around hiking and sightseeing. The second day they were here they left to go to town (60 miles away) for dinner. Two days passed and they did not return, although their tent and belongings were still here. Naturally, we became concerned. Then on the 2 nd night of their absence a © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 82 –"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"neighbor (from 5 miles away) drove them up to our place after finding them lost, confused and nearly delirious on the dirt road. On their way back from the restaurant they made a wrong turn into an extremely inhospitable arroyo in a small hybrid rental car and became stuck. In their desire to show their “wilderness prowess”, they began to wander and did so for 2 days, dipping their now empty bottled water containers in cattle drinking tanks and getting quite sick. It was obviously the most harrowing experience they had ever had. They told us that they were frightened to the bone upon hearing coyotes each night – as well they should be. They could have been attacked by those coyotes, wolves, mountain lions, poisonous snakes to name a few. The reason we tell you about these particular people is that they are indicative of the survival tourist mentality. The survival tourist mentality is often “I like to go rock climbing, hiking, etc., so I will make a good survivalist.” NOT necessarily ! Even though this couple was very adept at mountain biking, skiing, hiking, camping, rock climbing, etc. in the outskirts of suburbia, they were hopelessly unprepared for the realities of the wilderness. A weekend camping or hiking trip has nothing to do with living a survivalist lifestyle. If you find yourself falling into the category of survival tourist, we suggest you either re-assess your priorities and motivations or stay in the system.

We're not saying you need to burn every bridge, but we are saying that you need to choose which path you are on. Just In Case-ers Another category of survivalist is the JIC-ers (Just in Case-ers). These types tend to have a successful business in the suburbs and lots of disposable cash. They are convinced, along with the survival tourists, that once the SHTF all they will need to do is get in their Land Rover, head out to their bug-out land and all will be well. Good Luck. Some JIC's have gone through basic training in the military and some have even served in the infantry. This is excellent training. You learn to depend on yourself.

We are not saying you don't need guns and ammo. But you are not likely to need them for the reasons that militia types believe you do. If the army or police SWAT team decides to attack you, your chances would not be very good, no matter how much ammo you fired. We believe in the law of attraction. Walking around wearing BDUs and carrying an AK-47 or AR-15 and thinking you are part of the “army of the Republic” is not only deluded, but very dangerous for those involved. If you are a militia type, you are the excuse they are looking for to institute tighter restraints and controls. Feds love to show up at militia meetings looking like average Joes, and who say they want to share their money, illegal guns, and even supply bombs to “help with the cause”. Of course, these are all just set-ups.

I only found out later how close I came to meeting my maker when I found out that he was the “good citizen” who helped set up Randy Weaver.

Religious Zealots With all due respect to those who take their religion seriously, we have met many “crazies” who used their religiosity as an excuse for bad behavior. We were contacted by these religious types because we have a policy in our community of not being religion-based and not being judgmental of others beliefs. So this did open the door to people with divergent beliefs. Now, to be frank, we are not religious at all. We are spiritual, but follow no organized religion. I understand that some people do need religion. That's something that people have to work out on their own. But many – even most – survivalist communities have strict dogmas attached to them that all members must adhere to. If that is what you are comfortable with, just understand that the problem often is that there is a patriarchal “emperor” who calls the shots.

The possibilities are virtually endless, from plywood shacks to earthships to hobbit houses to Taos adobe to veritable mansions. Here are some things we learned by having built and lived in several houses over the years in the wilderness. As with any building project, planning is the key. What we have done with the 3 houses we have built is lay an outline of the house on the ground where we plan to build. Then we wait and study it for a while. You'll find that the longer you have it laid out on the ground, the more revisions you'll come up with as you feel your way around it. Better to make revisions in dirt than lumber. In the house we now live in, by using this technique we added a bedroom and and outdoor kitchen (a very popular addition here in the South West with our hot summers) before we set one cinder block in place. Don't be afraid if you have never done this type of work before. I spent nearly 40 years working on watches. We watch makers are reluctant to use power tools and risk being called “Lefty” or “3-finger Jake”. But once I got in to building I found that I took to it well and got in shape real quick. Moving 1600 cinderblocks into staging position and then up walls, carrying 4 x 8 sheets of plywood and 2 x 6s around is more effective than going to a health club – and while you're doing it you get a house!

We were in Tucson at a large campground and had to have some repairs done to our RV (a 2003 26ft travel trailer). The repairman had previously been an engineer at one of the many Terre Haute, Indiana RV manufacturers. He told us that the average life cycle of an RV was less than 6 months of use. He explained that the life cycle was planned for the owners' use for 6 summers in a row, for a week or weekend twice a year, and the rest of the time it sits.

We built an entire 750+ sq. ft. house out of cinder blocks and filled the cinder blocks with this adobe mixture. We only used 40 bags of Portland cement for the entire house, and this included the stuccoing we did inside and out.

These late summer storms can drop many inches of rain in a relatively short time. Being ready to collect this water bounty is important. In the Southwest water is key to survival. No mater what type of house you decide to build, it will have a roof. The best type of roof for water collection is a single slant roof. This type of roof drains the water on one side and therefore only requires one length of gutters under which a water tank or barrels are used to collect the water. You'll want to avoid using tar paper if you intend to drink your roof water. The best roofing to use for water collection is corrugated steel roofing.

Many survival guides don’t include this basic information. It starts with a solar panel, which collects light and converts it to power. The power is stored for use in batteries, and the batteries are connected (directly or through an inverter) to the devices that require power. It’s that simple. Illustration 15 : Solar Panel & Solar Cell If must power your household devices (laptops, etc.) using the AC power supply you’ll need to use an “INVERTER”. An inverter changes DC (direct current - 13.8 Volts DC) into 110 Volt AC (like house current). © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 104 –"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Inverters should only be used if there is no other way to power your devices. Converters change the voltage, not the polarity, for example, they can change 13.8V DC to 30V DC. This is what my satellite Internet modem uses. We found the converter on eBay for $10. Inverting power from DC to AC causes too much power loss and inverters themselves are not efficient as they drain, on a continuous basis a certain wattage, even if it’s not needed at the moment. Direct connection to your solar grid at 13.9V DC is best and if needed a converter can be used. Our D-Link wireless router uses 7.5V DC. We got a converter for that on eBay for $7 that handles 1.5V, 3V, 4.5V, 6V, 7.5V and 9V for $6. That powers the router without the use of an inverter. In the few instances in which we need to plug a device into 110 AC, we use a 750 watt inverter and this does everything we need it to do without drawing too much power. Other than that, all our devices are connected directly to the DC power. For most folks going solar means getting your mind into a solar power state of mind. What I mean by this is that you need to understand the electrical term, “WATTAGE”. Wattage is the amount of power an electrical device uses. All electrical devices have what is called a “UL” tag on the back or bottom of the device. The UL tag tells how much power the device needs to operate. For example, my Dell Laptop uses 60 watts and the power supply says 110v AC (house current) 60 watts, 60 cycles. © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 105 –"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Illustration 16 : Solar Roof Panels You’ll need to make a list of all devices you plan to put into your off the grid house.

Plan for Redundancy. Once you have lived the survivalist life – boots on the ground, so to speak -- you come to a bedrock realization that certain things were never made to be used long-term. Unfortunately, many of the tools and devices we've become accustomed to using fall into this category. Things like generators, electric well pumps, things that require propane gas, gasoline or diesel fuel are all on the road to becoming your next big disappointment when you actually have lived this way for a while. In everything aeronautical, every device is completely redundant. That is, there are two of everything. Two fuel pumps, two distributors, two sets of spark plugs, etc., so that in mid-flight, if one fails the second takes over seamlessly. When you live the survivalist lifestyle, it's like being up in an airplane. If something fails, you have to be prepared to have something to take over the job – that you have primary systems and redundant fall-back systems. Aside from certain machines' inherent nature of being unreliable, no matter how much gas, diesel or propane you have stored, you're bound to run out at some time. So we offer the following suggestions based upon our seven years experience and hard-learned lessons. “I'm okay – I've got a well, I've got a generator and I've got a heavy duty pump.” Well, of course, the weakest link in this chain is the generator itself, followed by the need for gas. In the last 7 years we've owned a dozen generators or more. Admittedly, early on in this life we had a lot of © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 114 –"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"dependence on generators for building houses and such. But that aside, even with meticulous upkeep and maintenance, all generators have a finite amount of hours they will live and when they go, they go hard, that is, usually unrepairable. We're not saying you shouldn't use a generator at all, but relying on it solely for getting water out of the ground is looking for disappointment. What would you give for water if an EMP knocks out your generator, or your electric well pump quits, or you run out of gas, or your generator just stops working? It would make your well a really expensive hole in the ground and not of much use. Even if you could get a bucket down there, how many times could you pull a bucket filled with water (at 11 pounds per gallon) up a few hundred feet with a rope? We found an excellent way to have a redundant (or even sole and reliable) system . It's called a Flojak deep well hand pump. So simple it's priceless. Installation only takes a few hours, most of that time spent gluing PVC together. With the PowerJak handle, it's easy to pump water out of deep well situations and releases you from the reliance on generators if you're off the grid, or from electricity if you are on the grid. No more dependence on gas, diesel or propane. And you don't have to give up your electric pump until you really have to, because the Flojak fits into the well alongside your current electric pump, ready to take over when needed. We met up with an old mountain hermit last weekend, who lives a few miles from us. No roads to get there, we took a nice brisk walk. He told me a couple of years ago that he knew living this life I would lose weight and get washboard abs because being self-reliant usually means © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 115 –"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"chopping your own wood, pumping your own water, toting the wood back to the house and many other countless chores.

Everything from McCullough to Stihl to Husqvarna, and being an old salt and having owned a few boats, most of them would make great anchors. In keeping with the theme or redundancy, all machines that inevitably break down or need non-renewable resources (gas) need a redundancy plan as well. Even if your chainsaw is still working and you still have gas, two-cycle oil, bar oil, a spare bar, a new chain, additional spark plug, etc., etc,, we found that a better way to go is a two-man saw . No stopping every few minutes to tighten the chain, or add oil, or re-fuel. And all we hear as we are cutting is the sound of birds, a gentle breeze through the trees and the rhythmic back and forth of wood being cut by hand.

Cluck, Yes! Chickens are a microcosm of sustainability. You can only store so much chicken feed and at some point the chickens must sustain themselves or become dinner. You'll be surprised to see how little tending chickens need, and how they are actually a very tight community. We have seen the rooster wait to begin eating to make sure that his hens are fed first and he is the first one to sound the alarm if something is not right. When the hens hear this alarm they begin to crouch around the rooster for protection. Our rooster will do battle with any one any time. He is quick to let you know that he is the god of the coop – and that's a good thing. Many years ago we lived in central PA among the Amish and Mennonites. They always said that the healthiest chicken was the one with the most varied diet. Luckily, we humans throw out a lot of food that chickens regard as the big buffet. Into the “Chicken Bowl” that sits on our counter, we break up and put stale bread, biscuits, tortillas, leftovers of virtually every kind and a little bit of feed (when we have it). A quick word on feed – if you buy feed, you want “scratch” which is a simple mixture grains. Any “crumble” will have additives in it, and pellets, in addition to the additives are made to be metabolized extra quickly in the chickens' digestive system. “Layer” feeds have additives that make the chickens convulse – and this is often arsenic – in order to squeeze out more eggs. We © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 118 –"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"prefer a more natural feed – “scratch” – over any of the others if we need to supplement their free-ranging and leftovers. Chickens are naturally very adept at finding their own food. It's called free ranging. Free ranging must be done knowing a few things about your chickens first. Knowing what time of day your chickens lay their eggs is key. If your chickens are like ours, they begin laying after noon. So we send them out to free range early in the mornings. We have them trained to return to the coop at noon by the sound of the chicken bowl shaking with the grain, leftover toast, etc., making a maraca kind of sound. Most come running once they see me carrying the bowl. In order to train any animal you must be very consistent, that is, every time you bring them food – either when they are in the coop or free ranging – make their food container rattle and do it at approximately the same time every day. They will get used to the rhythm very quickly and you can use this to round up the chickens before their laying time. If you allow the chickens to free range all the time you'll find eggs under trees, under your house, etc., which is why we round them up before their laying time. Molting is when a bird sheds some of it's feathers. All birds molt, it's natural, not necessarily a sign of disease. It happens every 12 to 16 months. For young chickens (those 16 months and under), molting usually happens in the Autumn © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 119 – Illustration 19 : Molting Chicken"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"of the year and last for about 4 weeks. The older the chicken is, the longer it takes for them to recover from their molting. Avoid buying molting chickens. A dozen laying hens on average will produce a minimum of 7 or 8 eggs per day, year round, with that number spiking as the days get longer and warmer. Typically, 12 laying hens can help feed 4 people daily with minimum effort. What to do with excess eggs? Noodles that are dried very well can be stored long term. Pickling eggs is another way to keep eggs long term. We also include eggs in soups and stews etc. Of course, the price of chickens will vary depending on your location. The best chickens to buy are pullets which are young hens, soon to lay. In so much that laying hens last an average of 5 years, it's best to get them early in their life. Prices can vary wildly. A search of craigslist will reveal what is for sale in your area. But on average, pullets range in price from $5 to $12, depending on your location. There are many designs on line for small, efficient chicken coops. We prefer to use stucco netting rather than chicken wire, because it is much more sturdy and can easily be buried and surrounded with rocks to keep predators away from your chickens. All you'll need is a few 2x4s, some stucco netting and a few pieces of plywood and you'll have an inexpensive chicken coop.

In our case we have 7 goats and we made a 4 ½ foot tall by 10 ft. square stone house with a plywood roof. They love to play “king of the mountain” on top of the goat house and they are fun to watch. Nothing is quite as playful as young kid goats. To begin raising goats, if your requirement is for both meat and milk you'll need one Billy (male) goat and 4 Does or Nannies (females).

If you are set on having a chain saw (read further on about alternatives), then in our opinion there is only one brand of chain saw to consider – Stihl. No matter what brand you get, get very familiar with its operation. You will have to know how to tighten the slack of the chain on the bar, how to mix gas and two- stroke oil (most chainsaws operate at a 50:1 gas to two- stroke oil mixture – check your manual), how to tighten the slack of the chain on the bar, when to add oil and bar oil (bar oil is different than oil) and how to tighten the slack of the chain on the bar. Did I mention tightening the slack of the chain on the bar? It happens a lot! You'll also want to learn how to sharpen the chain. We bought a DC sharpening tool, which is like a specialized Dremmel, but found we prefer doing it by hand with a round file. You can get a file and a guide wherever you purchase your chain saw. Stihl makes many different models, but for most of us who are not going into the commercial firewood business, we find the best models are the MS280c and MS290c.

We also highly recommend that you wear safety goggles when using a chain saw. Needless to say, using a chain saw to gather your wood is not as simple as pulling the starter rope and cutting. There is a simplistic alternative to a gas chain saw. A two-man saw is not as much work as you may think. Our son at 21 and myself at 59 use one together and actually have found it to be a much better experience. We rely on our body weight more than we do brute force.

Because we use cedar, juniper and pinion which are not very hard woods, a good hatchet is sufficient. Here in the Southwest USA, and at the altitude we are, we have a few different varieties of trees. The pinion pine is a pine tree that has pinion nuts in its cones. This is a slow burning wood, and can create a creosote build up in chimney and stove pipes. Many pinion pines are now dying because of the Japanese pine bark beetle infestation, and, unfortunately, the federal government has imposed a ban on cutting down the pine bark beetle infected trees. This beetle has devastated many of the Southwest's pinion, ponderosa pine and Douglas fir trees. We have observed in the areas around New Mexico towns like Cloudcroft, Ruidoso and Mayhill standing dead pine trees as far as the eye can see because of the pine bark beetle. © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 142 – Illustration 40 : Beetle Blighted Forest"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":" This could has been avoided if the federal government allowed private lumber companies go in to the infected areas and cut down the infected trees 10 years ago. On the bright side (?) in some parts of the Southwest, this makes finding standing dead pine trees less of a problem. Cedars here are not like the great redwoods of Oregon and California, but here in the Southwest, and at this altitude, our cedar trees are seldom larger than a good sized juniper tree (typically under 12 feet tall). We never cut a live tree, especially here in the Southwest where trees are not plentiful, because if you look around it won't take long to find what we call a “standing dead tree”. A standing dead tree is one that has died and is basically already seasoned, however it is still in the ground. Some areas of the Southwest (like where we are) have lots of standing dead cedars and junipers. These dead cedars and junipers did not die from the beetles (junipers and cedars are impervious to the bark beetle), they just got old and perhaps did not live though a drought.

Another good reason for pulling and cutting these standing dead trees is that they pose an obvious fire hazard. Cedar is the wood stove cook's first choice for fire wood. It burns hot, but fast. Cedar is reddish in color, has a very pleasant smell and splits very easily. Juniper is the type of cedar that has an edible blue berry (not a blueberry, but a blue-colored berry), not the red berried shrubbery that can be found back East (called “faux juniper”). This juniper is an aromatic pine much like the cedar. The trunk is two-tone (light tan and tan) inside, burns for a moderate amount of time (not as long as pinion) and puts off moderate heat. This tree along with the cedar tree should only be cut down if they are standing dead, no exceptions.

If it is a home to a rattler this should cause the snake to come out and coil and rattle. Its a good idea to have a side arm when doing this type of work, loaded with snake shot for the times when there is a snake living or hunting in downed trees or slash. Removing all the downed slash and trees from an area of at least 200 feet in all directions from your house will keep the rodents and rattlers away for your house, and owning a few cats will help with the rodents and snakes as well. It has been proven that the smell of a cat's urine will cause all rodents to have an immediate and extreme anxiety attack, so own a few partly in-home kitties and partly feral – feral enough to kill rodents.

Junipers have a very pungent cedar smell and have virtually no insects – much like the reason we use cedar chests to store clothes for long term. Place your clothes on the juniper tree “clothesline”. The clothes will have a very nice juniper smell and if they dry where the air is very rarefied (like it is here) you can also smell the ozone in them when you take them down. You don't need clothes pins, you just wrap a shirt around a branch and button it up. Socks are just placed over the juniper branch like it was a foot.

Why would anyone take pleasure in adulterating the food supply? Try this theory – if TPTB can make the masses believe that the cheap crap they get fed (butter substitutes from hydrogenated oils, sugar substitutes, flavor substitutes, etc.) is actually good food, then the less the peons need to have money and the more money is available for TPTB to harvest.

It sends out extra insulin to gobble up the sugar that is actually in your blood, causing you to be more hungry when your sugar levels dip. • GMO – yes, these do affect your genes as well! • Canola Oil – was first developed as a cheap machine oil. It has been shown to scar arteries and is made from a GMO “rapeseed” plant, which was originally used to keep deer away from other crops. Canola is short for Canadian Oil Co. • Hydrogenated Oils – this is a process in which natural oils are mixed with water to the point that the fat cells are broken down so that they actually emulsify with the water molecules. The detrimental effect is that now those fat cells can be absorbed through the intestines and get more fat and cholesterol into the bloodstream. This is also true of Homogenized milk. Milk is splatted against a steel wall so that the fat breaks down to be evenly distributed throughout the milk (hence, no more cream at the top of the milk carton). Again, this makes it easier for the fat to get into the bloodstream. • Soy Products – virtually all soy is GMO and soy raises estrogen levels – in men as well as © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 151 –"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"women. • Fluoride – fluoride is a toxic waste product of the aluminum making process. “ Hey, why not feed it to the people!

We knew someone who was a cook for one of the “elite.” He told us that his boss would eat NOTHING that wasn't grown on his own farm (meats included), and that this was the case with all of the other “elites” he was in contact with. But if one of the “peons” cares about what they eat, they are labeled a kook and told to take Prozac. All we know is that since our family is more careful to eat as little of these detrimental foods as possible – we spend hours reading labels before we buy anything – we feel better, are healthier and have more vitality than before and our minds are sharper . Speaking of reading labels, don't let a big splashy “Organic” on the front of a package fool you. It is now legal to call a food “organic” if only ONE ingredient in that food is actually organic! Foods that are labeled “organic” can contain any of the above foods to avoid as well, again, as long as ONE ingredient is truly organic. Bring your glasses to the grocery store and READ THE LABELS!

Our diet consists mainly of whole, organic grains (wheat that we grind into our own flour and brown rice), proteins from lentils and beans, farm fresh eggs from our own chickens, sea salt, raw sugar and vegetables from our own garden. We do eat meat occaisonally. For most of you, eating nutritious food that you prepare yourself will be a new experience.

It seemed so complicated with all those doors, levers and implements. I got a lot of good information from the book, Woodstove Cookery, by Jane Cooper. But actually, it turns out that it’s more \"feel\" than exactness. And as you use it, that “feel” becomes something you don’t have to think about. But here are some basics that will shorten your \"trainee time\". First, don’t be afraid of your stove. Feel the different temperatures on different parts of the stove (must I say it? Be careful not to burn yourself!), notice how long things take to get to the different stages of being cooked. Try using lower temperatures and notice how the food changes, and what subtle differences there are in the end result. If it gets too hot, close down the vents and see if that brings it to the temperature you need. Even if you burn something, there’s a lesson to be learned here, too --- just don’t do it too often! You will find that this is really an art, and very willing to give up her secrets. What kind of stove to get - Some people are lucky enough to find an oldie but goodie, used but still usable, antique. eBay has them from time to time, but you have to be able to pick them up yourself, as shipping costs would be unbearable. Besides, you would want to inspect it before you closed the deal. Most new stoves I have seen range about $2000. I got mine at a local building supply house, for only $411 in 2008 (I understand it’s $700 now in 2009). It’s a medium- © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 157 –"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"sized model, a “Hasty Baker 1864”, cast iron, made in China. But it has 6 burners (I’ll explain more later) and an oven that holds a small roast, 2 chickens, or two loaves of bread. It’s more than adequate. I’ve been using it all day, every day for about 6 years now and I have no complaints. We covered the kitchen floor with saltillo tile, so that sparks would not be a problem, and we built a platform out of cement board and saltillo tile so the cooking surface would be high and comfortable enough for us. The surival cookstove was also our source of heat in a 700 sq. ft. house we used to live in. Because woodstoves have a small firebox, it was necessary to fill it more often than we would have liked, so on the coldest nights, we had to get out from under the covers about every half hour to add more wood. But it did the job. How does it work - Most wood cookstoves will have a front configuration like this: © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 158 –"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Illustration 43 : Wood Cook Stove Front View On the top, near the stovepipe, should be a lever to open and close the flue (the opening for the chimney or stovepipe). On the left side of the stove should be another grate that can be opened to allow more air to flow in. There is another air-flow grate on the back, behind the ash box. The top will look like this: © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 159 –"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Illustration 44 : Wood Cook Stove Top View About once every month or two (depending on the type of wood I use and how often I use the stove), I burn a \"creosote log\" to clean out the chimney. This helps prevent a chimney fire and cleans out the chimney so that the draft is good, giving a better fire for cooking with. Some people say that if you get a really hot fire going for a while it will burn out the creosote, but I’d rather be safe than sorry. A basic concept of any survival guide. How to BUILD a fire - © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 160 –"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"The first thing to do is make sure that the ash box and the area that the ash box slips into are cleaned out of yesterday’s ashes. Then open the chimney flue all the way, open the left side vent grate and if you want or need to, the back air flow grate. Whenever I am teaching someone to start a fire, I always tell them to remember this: You are BUILDING a fire. This means, don’t start off stuffing all your big logs onto the newspaper or whatever you use for kindling, strike a match and expect it all to go poof and light. Start with small pieces and as the fire grows, add bigger pieces. Here is another thing to keep in mind when building a fire. Fire takes fuel (the wood) and air . If your kindling or bigger logs are too close together, you won’t have a good fire. I place three small rolls of paper (I find paper grocery bags ripped into 8\" by 12\" pieces and rolled up the best, newspapers second) on the grate in the firebox, and a few pieces of kindling on that. Don’t use too much paper, it’s not necessary and it will \"dirty-up\" your stove pipe. Kindling wood is the small pieces that come off the wood when it’s being split or is out on the ground. About 1/8\" thick and maybe 6\"-8\" long, and very dry. Rough, broken pieces light better. Make sure that there is air flow around the kindling, not all in one pile. Actually, I like to criss-cross the kindling over the newspaper to ensure that there is good air flow. Then I light the paper with a match and let the kindling catch a good flame. When the kindling is burning well, I add a couple of bigger pieces of wood until they catch well, then I add more logs to fill the fire box, but being sure I have air flow. At this point, I close the back © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 161 –"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"vent and bring the flue to halfway closed. This will keep the heat on the cooking surface and oven, rather than mostly flowing up the chimney. The next thing you have to do is wait – until the stove gets hot enough to cook with, usually about 15 minutes to 1/2 hour, depending on what you are cooking. First thing in the morning, I put the tea kettle on when I get the fire lit, and when it boils I know the stove is ready. If I should let the fire go unattended for too long and find you only have a few coals left, I add a few pieces of kindling on top of some of the hot coals, and then I blow on it gently through the firebox door (move your face away when you inhale) until the kindling lights, then I re- build the fire as above. Cooking on the Stove Top For the first few weeks, when what I was cooking was ready, I had to stop myself from reaching for the knob to turn off the heat! In wood stove cooking, heat is mitigated by where you place the pot or skillet. The heat on the stove top graduates like this (with 1 being hottest): © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 162 –"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Illustration 45 : Heat Distribution Numbers 1 and 2 are the hottest, since they are directly over the firebox, with 1 being hotter because the draft of the chimney is pulling the heat up to itself. Since the stovetop is flat, it’s easy to move pans around to change the amount of heat they get. I use mostly plain cast iron cookware, except for the few pieces of Le Creuset I have left over from a “former life” and some stainless steel pots I use for things like boiling macaroni. Once the cast iron cookware is seasoned, clean up is very easy, just remember to dry them after washing so no rust forms. But again, you have to wait until it’s well heated before cooking. (Wood stove cooking allows you to learn the pleasure of patience and taking your time.) However, it heats much more evenly © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 163 –"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"and holds the heat longer. For hotter heat, we add cedar logs, which burn hot and fast. Then I temper the cedar with pinion (pine) or juniper, which burn less hot, but longer. If you have a cast iron wok (or even a stainless steel one), you can remove the burner #1 above and set the wok right into the open fire. How to Bake There is a layer of air between the oven box and the rest of the stove which is how the oven gets its heat. This is also a place where ashes and creosote can build up. On most survivalist wood cook stoves, not only the heating circles, but the surface tops that hold them in place are removable so that you can get to the top of the oven box can be cleaned. I scrape it off so that it falls below the oven box and there is an opening there to scoop them out. Baking is a whole ’nother thing in a wood cook stove oven. It’s not easy to regulate the temperature, so you have to keep an eye on what it is you are baking or roasting, and turn it often to get more uniform cooking. Do get an oven thermometer. Even an inexpensive one is just fine, it will give you at least a good idea of the oven temperature. Once you have gotten the oven up to temperature (remember to have the flue only about 1/2 way opened so that the heat gets to the oven, not up the chimney), close the left side air grate and, sometimes, close the flue all the way (this is one of those \"feel\" things...you’ll know). This will cause the wood in the fire box to become a big bed of coals, rather than flames, which is what you want for baking. It will hold the heat © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 164 –"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"longer and at a more steady temperature. When you do need to add more wood to the fire box, just add a couple of logs, don’t fill it up. This will allow the oven to come back up to the temperature you want without over-doing it and running the risk of burning your food. I find that sometimes the heat on the firebox side of the oven is just too intense and burns the top of what I am cooking. I make a shield out of aluminum foil (without it touching the food), or cook in a covered pot. I will admit that when I make bread, the top of the crust ALWAYS burns. Try as I might, if I keep the oven cool enough that the crust doesn’t burn, the bread doesn’t cook. If the bread comes out right, the top burns and that’s all there is to it! So -- we all have to make sacrifices sometimes. We leave the top crust, but enjoy the bread. May burnt crusts be your worst problem. At least it means you have bread - and you're a survivor. © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 165 –"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Chapter 32 Recipes – What to Do with Your Storage Foods I can't tell you everything there is about how to cook your storage foods.

I have been doing all of my cooking for the last several years at more than 7500 ft. above sea level, so you may have to adjust some things for other altitudes. Just wanted to start off with a little explanation of some of the basics... Wheat Berries Wheat berries are the whole grains of wheat. They contain the bran and germ that are the most nutritionally valuable part of the wheat, and they are taken away to make white flour. If I have to use some white flour (to make something a bit lighter or because I’ve been too lazy to grind some whole wheat flour), I at least use unbleached. I like to think is has a bit more nutritional value than bleached flour. Soothes my conscience! Grain Mills For several years we used a \"Basics\" grain mill.

This breaks it up enough to allow it to cook easily, but retains enough of the \"roughage/fiber\" to aid good health. You can pick these up now for about $25 on ebay. We recently got the best grain mill we've ever had – a Wonder Junior Deluxe Hand Grain Mill by the Wondermill Company. We were investigating the Country Living Mill at about $400, but found and chose this one instead at $219. It has a large capacity hopper, comes with sets of both a steel and stone burrs, attaches to the table with either permanent lag bolts or a stable, double screw-on-and-off mechanism and grinds excellently.

Use plenty of flour while you roll these out – it will keep them from sticking in the oven. Place the rolled pieces onto the baking surface and check at about 2-1/2 to 3 minutes. At this point, they will be puffed into pockets, if they are going to do that at all. Puffed or not, flip them and cook another 2-1/2 to 3 minutes. I like to roll the next batch during the second half of the cooking. During the first half of the cooking, I’m usually stuffing the fire box in the wood stove. It’s important to keep the heat up while you are making these. I usually make a double batch (24) of these when I make them, because half of them get eaten up before I get the next batch out of the oven!

I place them on a floured baking sheet, rub in a bit of olive oil on top and sprinkle the tops with salt and garlic powder. Then I bake them in a hot oven for about an hour, turning every half hour to ensure an even baking. They pretty much double in size in the oven. This is the best white bread we've ever had!!! (Sometimes I substitute 2 cups of whole wheat flour for some of the white – no problems with the baking.) Cooking Brown Rice I use organic, SHORT grain brown rice. It cooks easier than long grain, and requires no soaking. But it still has all the nutritional benefit that brown rice naturally does. The water to rice ratio is 2:1. Two cups of rice needs 4 cups of water to cook. I heat my cast iron or stainless steel rice pot while I measure the rice and water. I add salt and pepper to the measured rice, then put it in the hot pan (no oil necessary) just to toast it a bit. Then I add the 4 cups of water, cover it, and set the timer on 50 minutes. I generally cook it on a high heat, even letting it boil over a bit. After 50 minutes, I check to see if the water on the bottom of the pan has dried out – been absorbed really. If so, I remove the pot from the heat and leave it uncovered for 10 minutes. If it’s still soggy, I check it every 5 minutes or so till it’s dried and I can move and uncover it. © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 175 –"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"After that 10 minutes I fluff it (brining any last soggy rice to the top) and cover it till I’m ready to use it.

The pasta can be rolled by hand to whatever thickness you desire. If it's nice and dry, this will be hard to do, but letting it rest every now and then helps a lot. Then roll up the rolled dough and cut into strips while rolled.

Fold it in half and crank again, repeating until you have the shape you want and it is smooth. Then run it through incrementally down to the thickness you want. You can use the machines cutters, or cut it yourself. If your rolled dough is a little too wet for the cutters, let it dry out a bit before trying again. I do so much with pasta. I run it to the thinnest setting and cut with the spaghetti cutter for fine noodles for veggie or chicken soup.

Dutch Oven Baked Beans Being at an altitude of over 7000', water boils here at 186 º F., not at 212 º like at sea-level. So getting beans to break down by simple boiling takes forever ! Especially Anasazi beans, which are extremely nutritious, but can also be tough. We discovered that cooking them in a cast iron Dutch Oven in a carefully tended “campfire” (extremely high heat) helps. But here's a tip we learned to make bean cooking take no time at all, and we find it alleviates most of the gas beans usually cause in the digestive system! Put your beans into a pot and cover with water, about an inch or two above the beans. Add 1 Tbs. baking soda per cup of beans and bring to a boil. Boil for 10 minutes.

We're just going to offer some short notes on hunting. As a basic rule, never shoot across a road, never shoot towards or near a house, and never shoot at anything you can't positively identify. That's just common sense. The lands of the Southwest are teeming with all sorts of wildlife, some of them edible, some not, and others only at certain times of the year. Rabbits and hares (jackrabbits are hares, not rabbits) are very low in nutrition and can only be eaten at certain times of the year. Rabbits and hares in the spring can carry a disease called “March Hare Disease”, a viral infection and the inspiration for the Alice in Wonderland character. This disease can be passed onto humans during the Spring. For this reason DO NOT HUNT RABBITS IN THE SPRING ! The disease affects the neurological system. It causes tremors and a high fever.

They are certainly not for everyone, probably an acquired taste (we don't eat rabbits/hares). Some of you from places where rabbits, squirrels, possums, etc., are eaten may have a different opinion. If this is your first experience eating a wild rodent, it may not be for you. If you choose to hunt rabbits/hares here are some things to know. Rabbits/hares never go too far from their holes and always run in concentric circles to make their way back to their holes. You can know where their holes are by watching what direction they travel when chased. Also, the vision of most of the predators of rabbits and hares is movement based. This means that rabbits and hares will stand completely still thinking that the predator (you) can't see them. This is good time to take a shot, because at any point they will take off running. I like the Ruger 10-22 for use in hunting a rabbit or hare, or a shot gun. If you want to be really primitive, you can set traps.

We are not going to go into great detail on this, but a little background will help. First thing you need to remember is that an elk, deer, or even an antelope is a very big animal. Typically an elk can weigh as much as 1000 lbs. This means you'll end up with over 500 lbs. of meat to either eat right now or preserve (See our section on © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 185 – Illustration 49 : Antelope Illustration 50 : Elk"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"how to preserve meat for long term storage with out refrigeration), using brines and jerky methods.

Antelope and deer poop are similar – little pellets of poop about the size of a pea. The deer's poop is a little larger. After a few days on the ground the poop will change from dark brown to light brown and eventually mix in to the dirt and disappear.

When we opened it up to field dress it, we found that it had its lungs, heart and liver all virtually destroyed by the shot (using an 8 millimeter Remington Magnum ). The animal was running on pure adrenaline.

Dill and garlic work well. Heat till completely dissolved and allow to cool completely. Then pour over two 1 gallon jars filled with peeled, hard-boiled eggs until the eggs are covered plus a little more. We also add sliced onions to the jars. Cover the jars and put them away. The longer they stay in the brine, the better they are. In our house, they don't stay around that long. A long time ago we gave a gallon of these pickled eggs to a family member who brought it to his favorite private bar. They got put into a closet and were re- discovered about FIFTEEN YEARS LATER ! A brave soul decided to try one. He said they were a bit crunchy, but still good! They don't stay around our house long enough to verify how long they'll keep this way.

Place a weight on top of the meat so that it stays submerged in the brine. When the meat no longer floats to the top, it's completely brined. To use the meat, we always boil it in an ample amount of water to remove most of the salt. Then we add some potatoes to the water and have a “New England Boiled Dinner”, or we fry it up with home fried potatoes. If you don't boil it first, remember that it will be extremely salty, so use it sparingly as a seasoning for soups (pea soup is especially good), etc. We were given the front quarter of an elk last year, and pickled it using this brine.

What will you do when there is no Internet? What will you do when there is no cellphone service? How will you know what's going on in other parts of the country or the world? Radio signals don't need an intermediary (read: controller) – they just bounce all over the earth and are received by radios. It's not even necessary that you transmit (speak) on the radio, but the information you can garner from just listening to others from far away is worth the time it takes to understand how to use a radio. We own a used Grundig Yacht Boy 400 and recommend it highly. These were made in the 1990s, but are still state-of-the-art. The CCI radio company sells a clone of this model today. Good used Grundigs can be found on ebay in the $50 to $100 range.

Our Yacht Boy 400 receives from 55 Kilohertz through 30 Megahertz, covering the entire HF (high frequency) band. In a time of crisis, shortwave may be the only radio signal out there. It may come in real handy when we can't depend on the Internet to know what is going on. WWV is the international time standard hack that can be found on the following shortwave frequencies; 2500 khz 5000 khz 10000 khz 15000 khz 20000 khz This radio station also allows you to check space weather as well as satellite environment (interference). We can use these frequencies to gauge the effect of solar activities on our radio communications. WWV has a very strong signal. For most it will be received as a strong S 8 to 10 signal strength. But in the event of adverse solar activities even these stations can become covered up with static and noise. So if you are trying to receive a certain station and are having difficulties, check WWV to see if their signal is coming though alright, or if it is covered up © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 195 –"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"with static. In that case, the sun is most likely the cause of your problems. Communications radios “Family Radio Service” (FRS) and “Business Radio Service” (BRS) are the frequencies for the common walkie-talkies you see often. They often say that they have an 8 mile range, however, most of these radios have a hard time transmitting farther than 2 miles. Not everyone lives in a laboratory environment. The 8 mile range estimates take into account “line of sight” factors only. If you can see the other party that you are trying to communicate with, you can talk to them. We don't live in a flat world without a horizon and without trees, buildings, mountains, etc. Because of this, these radios are over rated and can only be used for close-up communications (typically less than 3 miles at best). They can be useful if your community uses them in a small area (40 acres or less). The Business Radio Service does have base radios that have more power than family radios, and you can add an external antenna on a mast high above the ground to stretch their effectivity (up to 10 © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 196 – Illustration 62 : Family Service Radios Illustration 63 : Business Service Radio"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"miles). Some of you may be FCC Ham radio operators and have a Tech Class license currently using the 2 meter band (144 megahertz band). This is a good radio for the pre- collapse world. This band uses VHF frequencies. The drawback is that this frequency range is best when using repeaters (a relay station for radios to communicate with others). Once chaos ensues and repeaters do not work, the 2 meter radio becomes strictly a local communication device (typically a few miles, mostly line of sight). For long term planning you should consider an HF radio with a frequency range of 30 kilocycles to 30 megahertz. There are many ways to go in purchasing a radio, depending on your budget. You can buy yourself a brand new, state-of-the-art Kenwood or I-com for example, both of which are great radios. But the expense can be quite high, typically in the many hundreds of dollars. A less expensive but just as viable way to go is a “freeband radio”. This is a 10 meter ham radio that has had its MARS and CAPS frequencies installed. This will expand coverage to include the 12, 11 (the CB frequency © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 197 – Illustration 64 : RCI 2950 Freeband Radio"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"band) and sometimes 9 meter bands. More on freebanding later. A 10 meter radio is very common and inexpensive. Many can be found on ebay for under $200 and may already have the additional frequencies installed. NOTE: Expanding the frequencies coverage is often a very simple procedure. In some radios like the RCI 2950, 2970, 2990, etc., you only need to unplug a wire and press the reset button on the back of the control panel to expand the frequency coverage. Others may need a wire connected. If you have a little technical know how or know some one who does, it should not be a problem. The Internet is replete with plans to convert these radios. Just do a search for your radio model conversions. Any frequency on the radio can be used in various modes, the most common being AM, Single Side Band (SSB) and Upper Side Band (USB). Freebanding is when a unlicensed radio operator uses the un-allocated frequencies in the 11 meter band (CB © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 198 – Illustration 65 : Uniden 2510 Freeband Radio"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"radio and beyond). The legal frequency range of a Citizens Band radio is 26905 megahertz through 27405 megahertz (mostly in 10 kilocycle steps per channel), covering the 40 AM channels of CB radio. Most freebanders use the Single Side Band (SSB) mode of these channels as opposed to the AM mode. The chatter you may have heard on channel 19 (the truckers channel) is in the AM mode. AM mode of operation is limited in range, however using the SSB mode affords greater range and more out put power. A legal CB radio has 4 watts output on the AM band and 12 watts on the SSB band. This means that when conditions are right (sunspots, etc.) SSB signals can travel greater distances than those in the AM mode. One early morning, while driving west on I-90 in Idaho, I made a contact with Tokyo, Japan using SSB and my HR 2510 Uniden radio. That was a contact of over 7000 miles with less than 20 watts of power. Once the world goes in to collapse there will still be thousands of people using the freebands. This can be used to create a radio round-robin or relay to share information and help others.

A call frequency is a frequency on which we make contact with someone who would like to have a conversation with us. The parties then go to another frequency of their choice to continue the conversation. It is unlike the chatter you may have heard on the AM side – CB Channel 19 and all that noise.

Antennas There are many different kinds of viable antennas to use with your communications radio, some very cheap some very expensive. Some of you may choose to make a wire antenna. One of the simplest wire antennas is the “Inverted V” – very good for long distance communications that the radio community calls “skip”. The inverted V can be made for the cost of some wire and a pole. Others may prefer to purchase something ready made, in a box. For those of you who do, we can strongly suggest the “V Quad”. This is a directional aluminum antenna that sends a strong signal in only one direction. Like the directional TV antennas of past times, this antenna needs a rotor (this is a motor to turn the antenna from the radio shack).

When radio operators say, “conditions are right” they mean that the skip conditions are good, allowing the radio signals to be received over longer distances than normal.

Like a flat rock across a lake, the signal will skip along rather than pierce the ionosphere and go out into space.

Our satellite Internet connection is our only connection to the “outside world”, since we have no phone service (land line nor cell phone signal) available here. Satellite Internet connection speed is generally somewhere between the old dial-up AOL and a slow DSL connection. What we have experienced is about 150 kilobytes upload and 250 kilobytes download, not fast enough for a VOIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol – Internet phone) but it's OK for email, surfing and light duty stuff. These are some of the companies that offer satellite Internet services; • Wild Blue – not much on customer service, does not offer upload speeds that support VIOP. • Direct TV – Offers a package that includes a basic TV service and basic Internet service. • Hughes net – good customer service. • Starband – Offers speeds that support VOIP, however, our experience with their customer service caused us not to use their service. © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 211 –"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Some satellite Internet modems can be converted for use with a direct DC connection.

TV is not entertaining, it's mind-numbing. And it's not just the shows aired on TV, it's the TV itself. TV uses a standard flicker rate of 29.9 frames per second. As we discussed earlier in this book, this flicker rate will put your mind into a state (Theta) that is perfect to program suggestions into your subconscious while you think you are just watching a mindless sitcom or other show. If you haven't seen John Carpenter's movie, They Live , do your self a favor and watch it. It's truer than you know and was produced way back in the 1980's! If you think you are bing informed because you watch the mainstream media on that box, you sure are. You are being informed of exactly what TPTB want you to think.

Once you pull yourself out of this spell, you gain a new perspective about what is on the TV, and what is real in the world. A couple of years after we stopped watching TV we had occasion to spend a night in a hotel. Having been away from it for a while and having nothing else to do in the hotel room, we decided to turn on the TV. WOW! We were appalled, not only by the moronic programming, but the commercials just blew our mind! We are not slow-minded people, but we couldn't read the words flickering by within the commercials fast enough to read a complete sentence. We were truly out of that system, mentally.

It's not done to give you more information, it's done to confuse you and cause your conscious walls to break down so that the neuro-linguistic programming (do some research on NLP) can take a hold of your subconscious more easily. So, now that you've given up TV, what do you do with all those hours you used to spend in front of the box? Well, there is still talking available! One of the nicest parts of our days is first thing in the morning, when our son comes over from his house, we get the cook stove fired up and we all sit around the stove talking while the stove and the house warm up. There are also – believe it or not – books ! The kind that have pages you actually turn as you read each one to go on to the next, that don't depend on a machine and electricity being available.

Reading a book is very different from watching a TV show. Reading actually exercises your mind by transforming the words into images (which is how the brain handles thought – you think in images, not words) and you get to sort the puzzle out for yourself. I remember reading Stephen King's Cujo and wondering how they could possibly make a movie out of this book and relay all those thoughts the dog was having as the rabies overtook him. Radio is another form of entertainment and information gathering that we use around here. But here, too, you must be discriminating about what you listen to. The same mainstream, CIA directed news is broadcast on the radio as on TV, just in shorter spurts. And the noise level of all the “news analysis”/call-in shows, from Rush Limbaugh to Michael Savage to Glen Beck is enough to keep listeners off-balance and wondering just what the truth is. NPR stations spew the same garbage, they just sound a little better while they are doing it. But there is alternative news as well as other countries' views available on shortwave radio, and it's not that mysterious. For those times when we just really want to “zone out”, we have a collection of about 1200 DVDs that we watch – over and over again. They've become like old friends. We make each other laugh by speaking the lines we've memorized from so many views!

Could you live without seeing a doctor on a regular basis? Can you handle a medical emergency or a first aid need?

I venture to say that there isn't anyone who attended public or private school who isn't damaged in someway with feelings of inadequacy and insecurity brought on by not being like – nor accepted by – everyone else. Some of us feel this more than others. Not being chosen for the football team, cheerleading squad, French club, student council – whatever – leaves immutable scars that can be exploited later on in your life. Most of our feelings of inadequacy come from the school experience. All these feelings of inadequacy are programmed into children five days a week, 9 hours a day. So it's no wonder we are slow to take action. For lack of a better word, “the Man” (governments, corporations, et al) knows your inadequacies and exactly what to do to use them to their own benefit. The implanted insecurities are later exploited by advertisers to ensure that we are turned into consumers as soon as we are old enough to be given a credit card – or beg our parents to use theirs – and by governments to ensure that we are controllable and controlled. Michael Cremo's book, Forbidden Archeology , proves beyond a doubt that academia is solely interested in maintaining the status quo and a chosen orthodoxy, with out any regard to what is true, scientific or provable.

Even though you would think this would have been a fantastic find, one that the scientific community would cheer and acclaim, not a word of it gets aired in academic circles. Not a word at all. The reason you never hear of these “startling discoveries” is that the system is designed to produce “repeaters”, not thinkers. (I borrow this euphemism from David Icke.) Go to school for 12 years and repeat all the bullshit they stuff in your ears and you will be given a diploma that says you can repeat what they told you. I used to ask of people (and I always got strange responses), how much bullshit can I put into your gallon of milk? Even if we said that your milk was 99% bullshit free, would that be OK? Of course, the answer is you don't want ANY bullshit in your milk. Then why would anyone want bullshit in what they learn ? The system is not working wrong or badly. As magus Jordan Maxwell says, there is nothing wrong with the school system. It is working the way it was planned to. Schools are paid for by your taxes and spent by your government.

When we started this life I weighed 300 lbs. Now I barely weigh 200 lbs. Hard work out side will get you buff quick. And then theres the tan! Our house is cinder block and adobe and is under 800 sq. ft. That's barely the size of a moderate apartment. Our son, Jesse, and we built it from the ground up, block by block, and hand-stuccoed the walls, inside and out. It took about 3 months to get to move-in stage. If we knew how much work this would be, we might have opted for something different. We're glad we didn't know – we just did it. Move-in Stage means that after the walls were built we had the windows and outside doors in and got the floor and roof in for the bedroom section, where we also had installed a box wood stove where I would be cooking meals for the next couple of months. We had plywood separating the bedroom from the rest of the house, which had dirt floors and still needed a roof put over it! We moved in on Dec 4 th , 2011 and that night we were hit with our first cold snap – 7 º below zero! Now that we are settled into our beautiful adobe hacienda, here is what our daily life is like: • We carry water to the house from the storage tank or well with a dolly for the two 17 gallon water barrels we use on an average day. • We cut fire wood with a two man saw and split it with a hatchet. © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 231 –"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"• We cook on a wood cook stove that has an oven.

It's also important – maybe a matter of life and death – that you be honest with yourself . No force on earth is more powerful than the subconscious. The subconscious is responsible for directing your actions so that what you think the world should look like is the same as what the world looks like when you view it. Simply put, if deep-down you don't think you should be living the survivalist life – or if you don't really want to – the subconscious will cause you to screw up badly enough to make that lifestyle impossible for you. And those actions can harm not only yourself, but others around you as well. It's understandable that giving up some creature comforts, fast Internet speeds and proximity to a supermarket is scary . Frankly, suburbia will be a much more scary place when TSHTF.

Living without the bonds of TV affords me the luxury of having time to read. As my third book this month, I happened to pick the Leon Uris novel, QB VII, written in the 1970s, when there was still something to be proud about in America, and when there were still enough people around who could remember the horrors of WWII. The story takes place in post-WWII England, and is about a libel suit brought by a Polish Nationalist doctor (Kelno), a former POW in Jadwiga concentration camp, against a Jewish-American author (Cady) who names him as performing surgeries for German doctors who were experimenting on Jewish prisoners. This is part of the opening statement made by the defense attorney (for Cady) in the British courtroom: “ “Well, as a matter of fact there were some Germans, soldiers, officers, priests, doctors, and ordinary civilians who refused to obey these orders and said, ‘I am not going to do this because I would not like to live and have this on my conscience. I’m not going to push them into gas chambers, and then say later I was under orders and justify it by saying that they were going to be pushed in by someone anyhow and I can’t stop it and other people will push them more cruelly. Therefore, it’s in their best interest that I shove them in gently.’ You see, the trouble was, not enough of these people refused.” 1 ” When my tears subsided I thought, what an amazing time to be reading this.

The dozens of people we've seen succeed and the dozens of people we've seen fail gave us a keen eye to the attributes necessary to be a survivalist. Like we've told many people before, no matter how prepared you think you are, you're gonna go through some changes! So after many years of observation, below are listed the 6 essential traits every survivalist should possess to be successful. 1. Tenacity (“stick-to-it-ness”). This more than anything else has beaten many a would-be survivalist. We knew a young couple from TX who bought a 5 acre parcel in a very rural, mountain subdivision. They purchased a camper and a 40' shipping container and filled them with supplies. Before they ever made the move, the husband freaked out when he discovered that there were ants on the property! (Aren't ants everywhere ?) These weren't Fire Ants, just plain old picnic ants, and it was a real problem for him, resulting in their abandoning the property for the comfort of their old apartment. The ants were just his way out of a situation he never was committed to in the first place. As Sun Tzu said, “No one can ever be defeated who has made a strong resolve to win.” 2. Resourcefulness – in today's modern world, being resourceful usually means knowing what aisle at home depot has that pair of pliers. What we're © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 243 –"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"talking about here is true resourcefulness. Resourcefulness like building a house out of local rocks and local adobe, taking apart another house to use the lumber for your roof. Resourcefulness like butchering a chicken, foraging for Navajo figs, Yucca fruit and Pinion nuts, and then creating a glorious dinner with them. Resourcefulness like seeing the potential in a junker truck or a broken washing ma chine to be used in a new way. There is a house outside of Taos NM that was built entirely out of adobe and the windows from an abandoned truck, total cost for the house, $200 for 20 bags of lime. Resourcefulness is thinking outside the box. 3. Thick Skin – There will be countless people all around you who are more than willing to tell you you're crazy. You need to understand that you're the one who is seeing the world unveiled. Most people are very reluctant to admit that they are a product of television programming. Edward Bernaise coined the term “programming” because that's exactly what he intended. TV was developed to program society to take certain actions, feel certain emotions, want certain items and live a certain way – and to fear those who do not . Many people will try to validate their life choices by convincing you that you made the wrong choice, not them. Also, those who will try to take advantage of you are all too common. Many people who are conscious enough to be looking for a better way to live tend to be overly charitable.

If you've been given the gift of a vision of a better life, don't let someone take that away. 4. Improvise, Adapt and Overcome – This is the mantra of the U.S. Marines and should be the mantra of every survivalist. To improvise means to take what you have and use it in unconventional way to accomplish your goals, such as removing the alternator from a car and giving it new life as a generator to power your home. To adapt means to make course adjustments along the way to accomplish your goal, such as changing your house plans from stick-built to rock construction because rocks are plentiful. To overcome means to let nothing stand in the way of accomplishing your goals – to know that you can solve any puzzle put before you, face any foe and triumph. Be flexible and ready to make adjustments. 5. Solidarity – with everyone in your party. Whether you are a family or non-related group, everyone should be striving towards a common goal. This is much overlooked, however, crucial. I can't tell you how many times a wife or husband has asked us to convince their spouse of the importance of preparing. You must all be of the same resolve deep within to be successful. A disgruntled spouse or family member can scuttle the entire enterprise, whether overtly or covertly, often even below the consciousness of the scuttler. Have a sincere talk with anyone you plan on © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 245 –"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"joining forces with and make sure everyone is on the same page. 6.

The One Most Important Question Survivalists Can Ask Themselves Why Are You Trying to Survive? With the news being what it is, the world has now come to the point at which a huge shake-up is undeniable – to anyone who has 2 cents worth of brain matter between their ears. So hoards are joining the stampede to become “survivalists”. The movement has even spurred the development of the “survival industry ”, with commercials now being played on mainstream media stations for freeze-dried storage foods and solar generators. There is an old saying, “If you don't know where you're going, any road will do.” So if you are going to go the path of being a “survivalist”, first you'll want to know where you are going – and why. Plenty of alternative news outlets are trumpeting that “martial law” is soon to be implemented – and the facts they present in support can only lead to that conclusion. So everyone wants to survive martial law. But what is on the other side of the marital law? The reality is that martial law can't go on forever, but what will society/government look like after it has been dismantled? If 9/11 caused so much restriction – by law or by fiat – of travel, of personal dignity rights, of speech, of redress of grievances, what will the next event (planned by man or by the hand of The Almighty) bring? Will you take the chip to be given your ration of food? If you allow your children to stand naked to be viewed by pedophiles in order to shop in a mall or fly on a plane, will you say no to anything else demanded of you? Another major story all over the internet – alternative AND mainstream outlets – is that virtually the entire world's economy is about to collapse – again, a foregone © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 247 –"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"conclusion. Not a matter of if, but when. Eventually, the creditors demand their due. So everyone wants to survive an economic collapse and the chaos that will bring. But what is on the other side of the collapse? Putting aside all the sensationalism, putting aside all the hype and all the wishes, the most likely scenario is that a new monetary system, digital in format, no cash, will be instituted and run by the same bankers who run the dollar systems now – if not the same people, people with the same heart. They will tout the new system as being just like before (hush.... except that everyone's every financial move will be tracked, incoming and outgoing). It will usher in the removal of personal privacy and the instilling of fear. Fear that stops you from doing something, not because it's not right, but because someone says you shouldn't do it – usually because it does not benefit them. Is that alright with you? Will you join that society? Is that why you want to survive – to end up just as entrapped, even more so, than you are now? Far too many people die soon after reaching retirement. The reason for this is that they have spent their entire careers with the only goal being that retirement. They did not have a vision of life after retirement, and so they had none. An unfortunate fact. We have met many people who believe that they truly want to be survivalists. They have many reasons for wanting to survive, based on what they understand of the news. But over time they show that they still want to have one foot on third base, and so will never make it to home plate. They really don't want their comfy lives upset, they don't really want to have to give up their 62” plasma screen TV, they don't really want to eat foods they actually have to cook, they want to be able to whip out their credit © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 248 –"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"card at Trader Joe's forever...but they want to be out of the way when TSHTF, too. Their vision is to “hole-up” in a sanctuary until the noise stops, and then go back to the same rat race they were in before – the same rat race that got us all in the predicament in which we now find ourselves as a society. So why bother? If your ultimate goal is to save your neck so that you can go back to the same old same old, why would you put yourself through this? It's like quitting smoking and starting again, knowing that you'll just have to go through the withdrawal all over again. To be more exact, an ancient book of wisdom talked of “a dog returning to its own vomit.” Why put yourself through that? Why dislocate yourself and your family, mentally as well as physically, if you are ultimately happy right where you are? If you are contented to fight your way through the morning commute so that you can be given a paycheck for performing a job you hate just so you can still afford your $8 Latte Enema at the local coffee chain and you can use that money to buy your kids every throw-away toy the commercials tell them they want, STAY THERE ! You won't be comfortable outside of those bonds. The right answer to the question proposed in the title is: I want to survive because there is a better way to live, regardless of what the world “out there” does or does not do. I want to be paid by nature for my own labor and that of my family (by blood or otherwise) in being good stewards of the Earth. I want to help others who are also willing to work toward a common goal, each lightening the load of the other.

It is being lived now by those who choose to survive – not to survive the chaos, but to survive the beating down of the human spirit so that they may be a beacon to renew that spirit in light.

Not everyone can afford to go out and buy a 5 kilowatt solar array and the associated batteries. This article is written for those of you who want to begin your road to energy independence, as well as being able to use your laptop, mobile devices, or home security gear like the stuff at Safemart . Being self-sufficient doesn't necessarily mean living like a caveman.. 1. Switch to Linux Linux is an operating system – the way that Windows is an operating system – usable on PCs, MAC and Android devices. Linux's biggest advantage, other than being free, is that it does not allow viruses to infect your system. Any change to your system must be verified with your system password, so a virus cannot slip in. Applications such as word processing, video editing, spreadsheet programs and just about anything you can do on a Windows system are all also free. The goal of Linux as a community is to make software available to anyone who can use or develop it. One if its biggest advantages is the lack of anti- distribution or pirating measures like product keys or need to activate. As Windows operating systems require online activation, if the Internet is for any reason not available making activation impossible, you could potentially be unable to restore your hard drive without the ability to activate in 30 days. 2. Set up local communications with routers. © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 254 –"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"So, the internet is down and your modem rendered useless. What ever you do, don’t dispose of that wireless router. This can be an indispensable device for keeping local communication possible. This can be done by setting up a VPN (Virtual Private Network). The installation process of a VPN will depend on which operating system you use. If running Linux, you can easily set up an alternate to a VPN called IPTux. It is less secure than a VPN, but simpler. This simple to setup piece of software works more or less plug and play. Have your router powered up and broadcasting and have all PCs that receive your wi-fi signal run the IPTux application. To use it, just start the program in the system hooked up to your router (does not have to be connected to the Internet) and start chatting. This is a simple and effective way to keep in touch with a small community in a blackout scenario and can go as far as you have repeaters for. If you are concerned about securing your communications, a VPN would be recommended. 3. Keep alternative power systems, even if you’re tied into the grid. There’s no reason not to use solar or any other type of free energy, even if your needs are more than a simple off-grid power system can handle . You could still have your lower wattage devices running on solar or wind or other power source and not only save on your electric bill, but be prepared to still have basic appliances working if power is unavailable. It is always a good idea to dabble with off the grid technology. The more you put in to it, the more prepared you are to handle potential blackouts. 4. Have at least one man-powered generator for low © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 255 –"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"sun/wind days. With the many natural forces that you can harness as clean electricity, there will still be days when mother nature needs a break. If you want to keep your power more reliable than the forces of nature, it’s good to have a hand crank, stationary bicycle, treadmill, or anything you could use to manually spin a generator. Something as simple as a battery operated drill gun can be used to generate safe, reliable, clean power. This can be crucial. You may have a dire need of your power and be forced to wait until more favorable weather. You can avoid this by using a power source that runs on calories, the most simple of which is a hand crank. A generator with a crank handle can produce power right away. The stationary bicycle can also be an excellent choice. A treadmill however is unique because it already has a motor connected to it that can be reversed with blocking diodes. 5. Save important software and operating systems. You can download a Linux operating system and keep it on a flashdrive for posterity. Many contemporary Linux users will just download the software each time they restore, but you may eventually want to restore your hard drive or update your Operating System when the internet is not available. In this case, you want to have any software, operating systems, and data files backed up. It’s as simple as saving packs and folders to a thumb drive. 6. Become familiar with your computer’s finer components and keep spares. Generally, you won’t have to take anything off your motherboard but, for example, you can look at your power supply. This has one component in particular that is © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 256 –"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"normally the cause of the power supply itself coming to an untimely demise ... that would be a voltage regulator. This very small, three legged piece of silicon can be replaced on a board level if you’re somewhat familiar with a soldering iron. Notice the serial number on the regulator and make sure you have a few to spare. Other small, easily dispensed parts are, DC input jacks, diodes, resistors, peripherals (internal and external drives, etc.), and such. 7. Chelate Your Lead Acid (6 and 12 volt) Batteries. NOTE: Use extreme caution when doing this...use chemical gloves and eye protection. If you are not comfortable with this process – don't do it! Do not try to do this with a sealed-cell battery. This is a very simple and safe chemical process. What you will need will be battery acid (available at auto parts stores), distiled water, a 12v power source, baking soda and a supplement available in health food stores known as EDTA. In a nutshell, what you do is empty old the acid out of the battery and cover it with the baking soda to neutralize it. Rinse the battery’s cell with distiled water and drain it, and again cover with baking soda. Once you’re sure the acid is properly rinsed out of the cell, add a mixture of EDTA and distiled water. Hook the battery up to your solar panel or other 12 volt source and allow to charge until the battery is at 12.7 to 13.4 volts. The EDTA combined with the electrical charge will remove any minerals clinging to the lead plates. Rinse the cells again with more distilled water and cover the rinse water with baking soda. Then add the new acid and distiled water mixture. This will bring new life to old batteries. It is still important not to do this unnecessarily. You may waste acid © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 257 –"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"if you do this too often and you will gradually eat away more lead as you repeat this process. 8. Regularly recondition lithium batteries. This method of restoring smaller batteries used for your portable electronic devices (e.g. laptops, cellphones, mobile devices) is simpler than it may sound. It is done entirely by tricking the software. Turn off any of your operating system’s functions used to save battery power and allow the battery to completely discharge. Once you’ve done this, plug it back in and charge it, uninterrupted, until completely charged. It is vitally important not to unnecessarily stop a charge before it’s completely done. Your battery may eventually lose the ability to charge up passed a certain point if it gets used to being partially charged (battery memory). 9. Did I mention back up? Okay, I did. But this is, as I said, crucial if the Internet becomes unavailable. Always have duplicates or even triplicates if you find it absolutely necessary to have access to a particular file. Backing up is rarely punished and often rewarded. 10. Keep devices in a grounded box if you’re concerned about an EMP (Electro Magnetic Pulse). If you’re concerned about an EMP rendering your electronics to mere plastic and silicon, maybe a shield is in order. The design is pretty simple. You want to place your electronics into a metal covered box (it can be a cardboard box covered with aluminum foil), lined with a non- conductive foam rubber and grounded. This may protect your devices from damage from an unexpected “space © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 258 –"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"goat fart”. © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 259 –"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"VI. Choosing a Chief As the nation readies to choose a leader, to choose the one “on top” of the country, forget about the choices you have been given and consider what the criteria for a leader should be. Here's a concept to consider: Being on top means you serve others. Many Native American tribes choose a new chief by determining who has done the most for the tribe. Who has given the most to the tribe, in time, labor, courage? Who has taken in the most orphaned children, taken care of the most widows, given his plate of food to a hungry mouth? Who has done these things without thought of compensation for doing them? This is the one who knows the right path to follow, the path on which to lead the people. Who is our leader today? It is a man whose speeches use the word “I” more than any other past President's speeches. “ I did this...” “ I did that...” He has told business builders that they are nothing special and would have nothing without the government. Aggrandizement of self is not the sign of a good leader. Our current President stated that his wife should receive a salary for all the wonderful works she does. I guess all those taxpayer funded social trips to the luxury spots of the world for her, their children, plus her entourage of secret service agents, stylists and family members along for the ride isn't compensation enough. And I guess it isn't enough just to know you've done something positive (Has she? Is making school children eat scallions a positive act?). That statement by the President can only be translated to say, “I'm only in this for the money.” Who do we have to choose from in this “election” (read: © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 260 –"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"imaginary choice between the lesser of two evils)? One candidate has already had 4 years in office and has benefited only the bankers and a few huge corporations while more and more Americans go sleepless worrying about feeding their family tomorrow. The other candidate has spent most of his career amassing huge sums of money by sending American jobs overseas. How does that help the people of this country? How does that make him qualified – let alone worthy – of being the leader of the American people? Do we base our choice for a leader on promises never to be kept? Why do we even ask a candidate what laws he wants to create? A PRESIDENT DOESN'T MAKE THE LAWS! That is the job of the Congress – not simply to pass, without review, anything the President says to pass. The strength of the Constitution, the “checks and balances”, has been done away with along with most of the Bill of Rights. Is the question “who to vote for?”, or is it “why vote?” If your only choice is between two people unworthy of the office because the main factor in choosing a candidate is how much money they have and can amass (money is the key to candidacy and election), that is antithetical to the Native American way – with predictable results. Choosing the lesser between two evils is not the right way to choose any leader, it's like choosing which poison you'd like to die from. So if the choice is between demonstrably the worst president ever, and a corporate stooge who's only claim to fame is that he is really good at sending American jobs to China, then there is no choice at all. In an election, we are only allowed to make a choice between the candidates that have been “anointed” by the powers that be. And they have already chosen the winner, © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 261 –"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"and that choice was “announced” by the winner's attendance at the table of the powers that be. Lets take a look at the last 8 Presidents: • Richard Nixon – TriLateral Commission Member (TLC), Council on Foreign Relations member (CFR), Bohemian Grove attendee (BG) • Gerald Ford – CFR, 33 rd degree Free Mason (FM) • Jimmy Carter – TLC, CFR, Personal Valet to Rockefeller • Ronald Regan – 32 nd degree Free Mason, BG • George H.W. Bush (Bush 1) – Palladian Rite Free Mason, Skull and Bones Fraternity, CFR, TLC, BG and Bilderberger Meeting Attendee, as well as being the head of the CIA • William Clinton – CFR, BG, Palladian Rite Free Mason • George W. Bush (Bush 2 ) – CFR, BG, Palladian Rite Free Mason, Skull and Bones Fraternity • Barak Obama – Known CIA asset, Prince Hall 32 nd degree Free Mason. And ALL are related to each other and the royal families of Europe. Voting for no one when given a choice of two absolutely dreadful candidates is truly voting. Your not voting sends a message. The mainstream media rationalize that the reason why the numbers of people voting is dwindling due to apathy. Just the opposite, it is a declaration of dissatisfaction with the choices. A little known fact about elections: unless you are a member of the “demopoops” or “repooplicans”, getting into a congressional race or even the local dog catcher race becomes an unsolvable, deterring maze and nearly © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 262 –"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"impossible to accomplish. In the State of Georgia, there is a half-million dollar cash bond required to enter a state- wide race (senator, governor, etc.) if you are not acting under one of the two main parties. Then, if you do not receive 5% of the vote, your bond is forfeited. Any American can become President????? American democracy is strikingly different from European democracy. In Germany for example, there are the communist party, social democrat party, socialist party, workers party, Christian democrat party, the green party to name a few. And all have a place on the ballot. Also in Europe, the parliamentary system allows a vote of “no confidence”. If that vote is approved, the prime minister and his cabinet step down. If our Constitution included that feature, would our Presidents be a little more motivated to do a better job? We must stop choosing leaders by how well they did for “themselves”, and begin looking for the person who will do the most for his people – not someone whose only interest is what they are going to get out of it. Wouldn't you prefer to vote for someone with the spirit of the Great Chiefs: Pontiac, Seathl, Joesph? These men gave selflessly of themselves, for the greater good of their people. There's a new paradigm coming. The old rotting edifice of the current society is soon enough going to come to an end. If we have wisdom we will remember the lessons that the great Native American chiefs left for us... to be a leader means to serve. © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 263 –"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"VII. The Top 8 Deadly Myths About Survivalism For the last several years, our family – Dan, our son Jesse and I – have been living what some may call the “survivalist” lifestyle. Actually, we live the off-grid (so far off the grid that there is no land line and no cell phone service available), self-sufficient life. We're not here to get away from the world for a few days while chaos happens and calms down – we don't think that's the way it will go, anyway. We're here because we have chosen to separate ourselves from the rate race, the system, and not be swept away in the tide of what we see as society running amok. This is not a temporary lifestyle to us, it's a wonderfully peaceful, sometimes difficult and always rewarding life. Regardless of what does or doesn't happen “out there”, this is how we choose to live. We were basically “city folk”. But over the past 20-plus years, we formulated, clarified and realized our vision to make the transformation to our current life. We understand the fear and panic many are now feeling in contemplating making a lifestyle change in a short time because world events require that it be done. That is why we wrote our book, Surviving Survivalism – How to Avoid Survivalism Culture Shock . At one point we chose to lease parts of our land to form a small community of “like-minded” people (I would rather call it “like-spirited”) to help each other make it through what we know is coming down the pike soon – geo- politically, earth-chages-wise, etc. In that search for the right people (who we eventually did find) we met many types of self-proclaimed “survivalists”, most of whom were in reality “survival tourists”, a phrase our son coined for those who only wanted to investigate survivalism just © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 264 –"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"deeply enough to find the reason they couldn't/shouldn't do it (“Phew, I almost had to wash my dishes by hand !”). We met people who spent lots of money on land, a shelter and storage foods, only to forget the prepare the most important thing – their minds! It's going to take so much more than a gross of toilet paper to save your ass. You're going to have to put on your “big boy pants” and deal with things like going out in the cold to get firewood, learning to make pancakes with just flour you've ground, an egg and water and wearing the same clothes for years without falling apart (neither the clothes nor you!). The things you might think are important now will seem silly to you when you're more concerned with the dailiness of your chores that simply keep you alive through a cold winter. We met people who didn't think they could live without their 62” plasma screen TV. We've been watching the same 1200 piece library of DVDs on our laptop for our evening's entertainment for several years. We know the scripts backwards and forwards, but it takes our minds off the day's work when we need it. Before we were able to have our well drilled, we were depending on a local water delivery service (2500 gallons at a time, not a 5 gallon visit from the “Culligan Man”) who suddenly decided that he didn't want to make the rough trip to our ranch any longer. We had to make our last 500 gallons last throughout a brutally cold winter, washing dishes with 2 gallons a day, washing our hair about once very 2 weeks. But you find that you make it through. Here are The Top 8 Deadly Myths about Survivalism : 1. It's just like camping. It's nothing like camping. When you go camping, if you can't take a shower © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 265 –"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"for a couple of days, no problem, you'll take one when you get home. This will be your home , and you'll have to figure out how to keep your body (and clothing) clean all year long, in the cold, snow or wind. You can do without anything for a couple of days, even weeks, on a camping trip or you can jump back in the car and go to the nearest grocery store to pick up what you need. What if there were no grocery store available? How will you feel when your daily habits are interrupted, not just for a few days trip, but for the foreseeable future? 2. You can buy enough food and supplies for forever. No, someday what you have will run out. You'll have to learn to grow and/or gather new food supplies and to learn to use what you have, even if that means pancakes without baking powder. Someday you will have to wipe your butt with a washable rag instead of disposable toilet paper. Someday there will be no gas to get to the store and the store won't have anything on the shelves anyway. 3. Your neighbors will gather around and help each other. Think about your neighbors who haven't got a clue – or can't bear the thought – about their comfy suburban lives changing when the reality of where society is going hits them “upside the head”. What if your neighbors can't get their daily supply of cigarettes, beer, Prozac, soda pop, etc., etc., etc.? Are they going to be the kind of people you can depend on? For how long? 4. If I buy enough gadgets (mini washing machine, © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 266 –"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"generator, solar tracker, ) I'll be OK. If you truly believe that society is in for a big shake up, you'll realize that this is not a time to spend money unnecessarily, but to put every penny you can into what is practical . Gadgets are going to break down and then you will have to learn to live without them anyway. Why not learn now? 5. I can get to my survival location when TSHTF. This is the most flawed – and perhaps the most popular – plan: thinking that when all hell breaks loose you will know in advance enough to travel the hundreds of miles to your survival location. When the door slams shut the highways will be blocked, the urban and suburban streets will be blocked and patrolled and no one will be going anywhere! Even if your survival location is only a few miles away, you probably won't be able to get there. If you truly understand the need for being “survival- minded”, why not begin living the self-sufficient lifestyle NOW? Learn what it really means to live off-the-grid NOW, not when there is chaos all around you. You may find that it's a much better lifestyle than the one you are living now. 6. I can convince my “significant other” that this is the right move. No, you can't – and you shouldn't. All you can do is give them information and allow them to do with it what they do. People either get this or they don't. It's not for everyone. This goes for all family members. I'm not saying go or don't go without them. That's an individual, circumstantial decision and action. If all members © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 267 –"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"of your family are not on the same page, you'll have to determine what to do. Staying where you are may be your choice. Just do it as an informed decision. 7. I don't need to prepare a place. I'll just grab my Bug-Out-Bag and find a cave somewhere. How many others do you think have that same plan? Especially those who live near caves, already know where they are and already expect to be occupying them? And can your bug out bag hold what you really need for an extended period of time? 8. My kids will be bored. Your kids will be learning so many new ways of living, so many daily activities and chores, connecting with nature in so many new ways, they won't have time to be bored. Allow them the freedom to discover things like what bugs are in the grass around your home, what plants grow, what wildlife is still abundant on this beautiful land...if your attitude is one of wonder, not worry, so will theirs be. Help them look at this as an adventure, not a burden. If you do not yet understand why it might be time to make a move from your comfy, familiar, suburban lifestyle, you're not watching the news. Or maybe you are only watching mainstream news, who tell you “everything is as it should be.” It's not. Friedrich Nietzsche was right... “That which does not kill us makes us stronger.” It's amazing to see just what we are capable of living through, of accomplishing when we depend only on ourselves. When there is no safety net, sometimes you just learn to fly. © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 268 –"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"VIII. A Day In the Real Life Thank you for the wonderful response to our article, Top 8 Deadly Myths About Survival. Many of you wrote asking for more information about the day-to-day life. Here's a peek at a typical non-winter day. It's noon-ish. The first round of chores are pretty much done. So far today, here is what we've been up to: Woke up at 4:00 a.m. because a pack of coyotes was howling too close to the chicken coop and we had to let the dog out to protect them. Then we went back to sleep to the sound of the dog barking. Well, okay. That's not exactly a daily happening, but it did happen – last night! Around 6:00 a.m. we get up for real. I light the kitchen wood stove to warm up the house and get breakfast going. Breakfast is usually fresh farm eggs, pancakes, biscuits, cracked wheat cereal or such. We grind our own flour by hand. That means attaching the grain mill (we use and recommend the Wondermill Junior Deluxe Hand Grain Mill) to the kitchen table and the guys taking turns cranking for about ½ hour to an hour, depending on how much flour I think I'll need that day. Sometimes we add rice flour with the wheat, and rice is even harder (and slower) to grind than wheat berries. The guys are getting such bulging biceps! If you'd like to know how to use that flour for biscuits, etc., we've got a great recipe section in our book, Surviving Survivalism – How to Avoid Survivalism Culture Shock . While breakfast is being made, the guys feed the chickens yesterday's leftovers, and feed the dog and cats. Cats are an absolutely necessary tool in the wilderness. They not only keep the mice at bay, they take care of snakes and © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 269 –"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"large bugs, too. Also while breakfast is made, the guys tend the garden and greenhouse. They water it, feed it with a little extra compost and prune the suckers off the vegetables. Then they jump on the Internet to check things out...and see if the outside world is still in existence! Breakfast is done about 8:00 a.m., when the guys go out to cut and gather wood, tote water from the large storage tanks into the house and into the garden for afternoon waterings (don't forget we live in the desert) while I clean the house – clean the kitchen, make the bed, sweep the floor (a never ending battle between us and the dust!) Before I do the dishes, we need to make sure the gray water cllection barrel under the sink is emptied to be used for plant watering or mixing mortar. I want to note here that we do not assign chores based on gender, but by ability and availability. Many days I have something else taking my time and by the time that chore is done, the kitchen and cleaning chores have been done by Dan or Jesse. I can't help cut the firewood, so since the dishes need doing, I do them – with a happy heart. If I am interrupted in the middle of cooking, one of the guys steps in to take over so I don't have to worry about it while I'm busy with something else. While I'm cleaning, I put up a big pot or rice for later meals. Usually we'll fry up the cooked rice with seasonings, herbs, maybe scramble an egg or two in it for lunch. Sometimes we make fried rice balls. Sometimes we make veggie gravy to go with it. You really can do a lot with just a few ingredients! After I'm done cleaning, I get the bread dough mixed and rising. I make two loaves of peasant bread (a very simple bread, only flour, water, salt and yeast in the ingredients © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 270 –"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"list, baked free-form – no loaf pan) each day. They're usually both gone by the evening, but if I'm lucky I have a half loaf left for toasting for breakfast the next day. Some days I make whole-wheat tortillas instead. By mid-afternoon (often earlier) it's time to get dinner going. Often it's lentil chili, or home made pasta, boiled then sautéed with our garden vegetables, or beans and rice, or stir-fried veggies, or maybe this week we've got a chicken for soup with fine noodles. After dinner we generally watch DVDs to just chill out. In between chores, at any time of day, we take a break here and there outside, under a juniper tree, enjoying the light breezes and just stopping for a moment to smell the roses – well, cactus anyway! In addition to the daily chores, we experience some things that throw our schedule off – • The toilet is backed up and needs fixing. • No power because of clouds several days in a row. • Having to stay indoors more for a few days because of smoke conditions in the air from distant wildfires. • Someone gives us a gift of a ¼ of an elk and we spend the day butchering, pickling and feasting! • Some days it's the day we plant the garden. • Some days we pump water from the well into the storage tank. • Some days we do laundry – during “monsoon season”, July and August, that means we put the dirty clothes into a barrel of soapy water, stir them around, squeeze them by hand and lay them, soapy, along the slash fence, waiting for the next rainstorm to rinse them and the next morning's sun to dry them. © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 271 –"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"Add to that in winter months that we are constantly filling both wood stoves to keep warm.

Removal of Choice This is a special report from the outskirts of the action as the U.S. – as we grew up to know it – is in its final death throws. This is less than a week from the infamous Batman Massacre and the new talk – not unexpectedly – is for more gun control, to the point of total disarmament – but of the people, only! This morning I heard an excerpt from a speech by Mr. Obama in which he said that he was as for the 2 nd amendment as anyone, because he understood that it's an American tradition to hunt and shoot, but that you don't need an AK47 to do that. Well, that's not what the second amendment is about. They've been trying to make us forget that the second amendment was put there for the people to protect themselves against a tyrannical government. If we were true to that, we would have weapons that were equal to those the government has! But we don't, and, frankly, we don't even want them. We have a weapon far superior to anything they can put in our faces... the power to say “no” to doing something that is, at its essence, wrong. Many people are awaiting the “big event” so they will know it's time to do something. Well, it's not going to happen that way. It is happening now and has been happening for decades in the “bologna slice” method. Say someone gives you a whole bologna. Then they take one slice and, well, that's ok, it's just a little slice. You still got plenty. Then they take another slice, and another slice and pretty soon, you got no bologna left. Like I said, they've been doing this to the U. S. for decades, but it's been put into hyperspeed since 9/11.

What matters is that they are trying to completely take away your CHOICE ! That's the most egregious aspect of this slaughter of America – the removal of choice.

It was also when Marabel Morgan wrote the book, the total woman, which was about being extremely – even overly – feminine. Time magazine did a story on the book and I wrote a letter to the editor which actually got printed. It said, “I wish to thank Marabel Morgan for allowing me to feel good about being a feminine woman. And I wish to thank the national organization of women for giving me a choice.” Having a choice is what is important. And the more it's ok with you that you have no choice in this or that, the more choices will be taken from you.

And if your decision is to take the medical care, how long will it be before you have no choice as to what drugs you do or do not take. If you're overweight, will you be allowed NOT to take the newest weight loss drugs, regardless of any side effects they may have? Or regardless of the fact that you may be happy with yourself at whatever weight you are? Slice of bologna, slice of bologna. Who makes the choice of how you live your life? Very few – a minuscule number – of people can say they do and be telling the truth. You may think you choose where you work, but the schools have guided you and trained you to have what TPTB consider a good job. Good enough to filter most of your paycheck up to them. You may think you choose where you live, but the corporations set up their offices in the place that is best (i.e., most cost effective) for them and you live nearby because you have been guided by the schools and every commercial you see to get the most money you can, and the big corporations seem to promise that.

An Unusual Perspective Some may call it a self imposed exile, but several years ago we separated ourselves from so-called “society”. It's a 90 minute ride to even get to a town from here, mostly across dirt ranch road, some of it “primitive” (white knuckles). About a year ago, our Ford Bronco died, and we got swindled out of $3000 for a replacement truck that...well, long story, but suffice it to say we haven't had a vehicle since then. We haven't left the ranch in about a year. The handful of times we had visitors since then, they have been so kind as to bring us up some small amount of groceries for a “treat” or two, but we gained something very special in that time – perspective . It's not like we've always lived so remotely and we don't know what the other side of the world is like. Many of the past 25 years we lived in suburbia, raising our kids and working our successful business. We traversed the country more times than I can count as we drove to the seminars we taught, kids in tow, giving them a better education than they could have gotten in a classroom. We stayed in major cities when we, too, were involved in the never-ending rat race. We went to restaurants too crowded to enjoy a meal, we took the kids to the requisite amusement parks, we stayed in hotels that didn't realize their business was hospitality . But our vision was always to walk away from that life, towards one more connected to the nature part of human nature. To live a more natural life, abiding by natural law – which is the only absolute law under which humanity lives, anyway, whether we know it or not. As our culture fights natural law, believing that it can overcome the natural consequences of our actions, we © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 277 –"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"simply screw things up for ourselves. In fulfilling our vision, in breaking away from riding that wave all the way to the shore, we halted those pieces of personality from their natural path within the human psyche – their final destination to dehumanize those caught within it. What we see from our vantage point is too many people living around millions of other people and having no connection to them whatsoever. Thirty years or so ago, and for a couple of years, I commuted from New Jersey to my job in Manhattan by train, walking through Penn Station at the rush hours to get to and from my office. This was about the time that the Sony Walkman (a personal audio cassette player if you're really that young!) was developed. Daily I saw hordes of people, walking around – no, shuffling around, it was too crowded to really walk – who believed that if they had their Walkman headphones on in that sea of bodies they would be carried away to a place that was not so frighteningly crowded. They actually felt like they had some kind of privacy while trying to catch the next train home. It was like thinking that if you close your eyes, the world no longer exists. What we see from our vantage point is too many people trying so hard to keep their heads above water that they are sure to drown. It's so hard these days to just make a mortgage or rent payment, hard – and soon to be much harder – to feed yourself and your family a satisfying meal (let alone what is available as food) that the population can do little else but think of themselves. By financial and other manipulations by TPTB, we have been taken from a prosperous culture with a bright and hopeful future to a slave society with no future other than to push papers around, serve a hamburger, or take a government job in © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 278 –"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"which we can get to feel superior to the masses, so that we can pay for our own room and board while any spare change goes to the top echelons, leaving most people with no time to be kind and considerate to themselves nor to others.

What we see from our vantage point is too many people who have no soul left, no more light of intelligence, common sense or even lust for life left in their eyes, following the daily routine they have been given to follow without question of its rationale. The masses wait placidly on line to be physically molested or irradiated for the privilege of boarding an airplane, watching silently as the 87 year old granny is strip searched for a fabled threat. Too many drivers go past and don't really see the newly stacked jersey barriers on the highway that wait their turn to be used to choke off the traffic flow.

Running Out – A Prepper's Worst Nightmare September is “National Preparedness Month”. The one thing left out of all the hype for this new “celebration” (yes, I've read an ad on a web site that said “Celebrate [9/11] with a 20% discount...”)is, for how long do you need to be “prepared”? You have to understand that you cannot buy enough toilet paper to save your ass. Say you're one of the smart ones who has been prepared for whatever is coming down the pike to survive through. You're already set up in a remote location, gotten your dwelling built, and you have separated yourself and your family from “normal society (the system)”. You've been studying and experimenting with gardens, but haven't perfected the art yet. You haven't had a need for money in a year or two, because you've been living off your well- stocked larder for that time. Suddenly, and seemingly all at once, things in that larder begin to run out. Now what do you do??? When the baking powder runs out, you learn to make flat pancakes. When your chickens aren't laying to put eggs in the pancakes, you make breads instead (and a pot of chicken soup here and there). When the flour runs out, you grind rice and get creative with it. When the rice runs out, you start eating lentil soup, lentil burgers, lentil chili (even though your chili powder ran out a month ago, too) – and you lose a lot of weight. Just take a trip into town to re-supply? Well, maybe that's ok for now, while there still is some semblance of an economy. But what will you do if that economy – and society – have completely collapsed and there are no stores in which to shop? Prepping is a great way to start to get you mentally ready for separating from the current average urban/suburban lifestyle.

I'm not talking about being a weekend warrior. I'm not even talking about going on an extended hunting trip. I'm talking about learning to live a new way, a way that includes new ways to find food other than going to the local supermarket. A way that includes using washable rags instead of disposable toilet paper. The idea may be frightening to many – probably most – of you. You've been taught that there is only one way to live and that is the consumerist life. A sure sign of success is how much “stuff” you have. Well, in the near future, success may be boiled down to did you eat today, did you feed your family today, did you sleep inside, out of the cold last night?

Fear Itself If we were to pinpoint the one pervasive emotion in society today, it would be fear. People all around you are fearful of almost everything. They fear the police. They fear the IRS, ATF, TSA and all the other “alphabet police”. They fear losing their job. They fear loosing their house. They fear their city or town government. And they fear the mother of them all – fear of continuing life without enough money to maintain their current lifestyle (or at least the one the remember from a decade ago). Most people rationalize these fears as normal because “everyone has them”. We are trained from a very early age to act out of fear. We fear our teachers wrath, so we do our homework. We fear clergymen, for they decide if we go to heaven or hell, so we say all the right prayers. We fear older children who may bully us so we cross the street to avoid them. Later on in life we fear the cost and hassle of a ticket, so we fasten our seatbelts. We fear losing our house so we work in a job that means nothing, offers us no personal satisfaction other than just enough money to keep us trying to reach the carrot on the stick. Try this experiment... list all your obligations for the next 30 days – work, social and financial – then place a star beside those that cause you any concern (fear). Most people who do this discover there are multiple things in their immediate lives that cause them fear. Today, in 2012, there is plenty outside of our daily lives to fear: Will the world end on December 21 st ? Will WWIII start in Iran? Will the economy collapse? Will the poles shift position? Will the sun (or another country) send an EMP that knocks out the electrical grid? Will martial law © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 285 –"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"be implemented? Have we foolishly given the President of the United States so much power that he can become a dictator? Will food supplies run out? Will the weather continue to be abnormal? Will chemtrails ultimately poison us? Will GMO crops take over all others? Are you scared yet? Many of these fears are constantly and purposely reinforced by what I like to call “the pop culture”. Television is the greatest purveyor of fear, usually by embedding feelings of inadequacy. I recently read that the average American watches 34 hours and 39 minutes of TV per week. That's a good deal more than it would take to participate in a college course. Like the college course, you are being instructed and trained by the TV. Edward Bernaise coined the term “television programming” and his rationale was crystal clear – television was designed to program people into becoming happy consumers. These happy consumers are being motivated to purchase garbage by an external force that exploits feelings of inadequacy. Every time we watch a commercial that shows the handsome man with a real “babe” sitting next to him in his shiny new car, in our minds we feel inadequate for not having a new car, too. These feelings of inadequacy open the door to fear, especially when we are given nothing of real value to replace those desires. Fear is the toolbox of “the powers that be” (TPTB). Fear is the lowest vibration humans can be affected by or give off. It impedes our path to higher (vibratory) levels of consciousness and ascension as human beings. People who live in a constant state of fear are very manipulatable. TPTB understand that if they can make people fearful, they can make them do anything.

The intensification of this fear began as a full-frontal assault in the days immediately after 9-11. It was fear that caused Americans to lay down – not once, not twice, but 3 times – and approve and abide by the Patriot Act and now NDAA. It was fear, not patriotism that caused many of us to cheer the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. It is manipulated fear that allows a once free society to accept such a campaign such as “see something/say something” – fear your neighbors, fear those who think the Constitution was a pretty good document before it was overruled by executive orders, fear those who are not dependent on “the system” for their lives, fear those who have a different opinion than you do. It is fear that keeps us from opening our mouths and saying “No” to those actions that we know are not right. TPTB know this music very well and play it long and hard for all it's worth. They are congratulating themselves, patting each other on the back for causing 350 million people to be so fearful that they consistently act against their own self-interest – and against the last vestiges of freedom. Their jubilation is caused by knowing that 99.9% of you are easily controllable and predictable. Hitler's “final solution” required countless numbers of troops, gestapo and SS to carry it out.

How do we overcome this fear that has been instilled in us?

I was never afraid of a thunder storm again. Look at the reality of that which you fear. Do we need to fear Al-qaeda because of 9-11 to the point of fearing any Muslim person? It wasn't they who planned it out, they were simply to stooges used to perpetrate an evil action against 3000 innocent Americans, which action was at its essence an excuse to take Americans' freedoms away. There has been no secondary attack in the 11 years since that horrific event. If they wanted to destroy us, wouldn't they attack when we were still reeling from the first one? Do we need to fear a neighbor who might be having an exercised conversation on his cellphone in a Wal-Mart to the point of calling in a SWAT team? Not if we take the time to take a walk passed our own house to our neighbor's to introduce ourselves and thereby learn who he or she is. Do we need to fear an 83 year old grandmother taking her final flight to see her grandchildren to the point of humiliating her before allowing her on a plane? Or a 4 year old child screaming in terror? Or a business executive? Or YOU?

One In a Million One in a million spouses, that is, would dare live the survivalist/self-sufficient lifestyle. The thought came to me as I watched my wife, Sheila, sweep the plywood floors of our hacienda style house and thought to myself, how many wives would even consider living this way? The plywood floors will be replaced next spring with tapped clay floors – and that will present its own challenges – but really, when you break it down, how many of us have a spouse who would even for minute consider the self-sufficient, minimalist life style? Truth is, maybe 1 in a million. Just take a look at survivalist single sites. It's mostly men looking for a woman to share their cabin in the wilderness with. Women have a nesting instinct (nothing sexist in that remark, it's just a truth of physiology) and usually seem to know exactly what they want. Men also know exactly what they want. Regrettably, the two seldom find common ground. One of the books of ancient wisdom says, “Two cannot walk together lest they be agreed.” Unfortunately, we have seen a lot of people trying to do just that – living the off- grid life because that's what their partner wants, not because that's what they want. This always results in failure. All too often that failure exhibits itself in sub- conscious self-sabotage. I can't count the number of times someone has contacted us to ask us to convince their spouse to agree with them about the need to prepare. Certainly more than the number of times we've met a couple who shared the same sentiments about the self-sufficient lifestyle. And it's about 50/50 as to whether it's the woman or the man in the relationship who “needs convincing”. © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 290 –"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"But the truth is, you can't – and shouldn't try – to convince anyone to live a lifestyle that is foreign to them. All you can do is put the information before them and allow them to do with it what they will. If that is ignore it or run away from it, then they'll ignore it and run away from it. If they ask more questions, perhaps they can face the reality of what is happening and can understand the need to take action after being given a bit more information. But if the significant other cannot bring themselves to make a life- change, then the next step is to make your decision. You may choose to go on to a new lifestyle without your spouse – or you may choose to stay where you both are. Each circumstance is unique and no decision about this should be judged by others outside of the relationship. But if you make the decision to stay, do it with your eyes open and without resentment of the other person. Do it because it's your choice, given all the information, emotional information included. However, in the infinitesimal number of cases in which both spouses are of the same mind about living the self- sufficient/survivalist life, amazing things can be accomplished by two people who love each other and work together on a common goal. Certainly, one can survive alone. But if you are going to live the self-sufficient life with someone, make sure it's someone who honestly has the same goal as you. © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 291 –"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"XIV.

I know another family that lives in a big suburban house in a gated community. Dad goes off to work every day and is not involved with the children much except to pay for what they see on TV with his 12-14 daily hours of labor. Dinners are usually eaten separately and consist of whatever was convenient to pick up from a fast-food restaurant on the way home.

Fear Itself – Part II The Power of NO Some people in the scientific community speak of “genetic memory”, also known as racial memory. This is the way in which a person's DNA can be permanently altered by external, psychological forces. This change – and its emotional effect – is then carried forward to the next generations. There are genetic fears implanted deeply within us by which we are manipulated on a daily basis. It is also possible to be free of these fears and loosen the controls under which you live. The purpose of programming fear into the masses of people is to control us – and is it ever effective! Fear, although it is a very low vibrational force, is an extremely powerful emotion. It is used extensively in brainwashing programs, because nothing makes the implanting stronger than a good dose of fear. In order to rid ourselves of the fear, we must look at the methods used to instill it. According to ancient stories, Nimrod of old Babylon, King of the Chaldees, known as a brave hunter of boars, convinced his people that there were great dangers outside his city walls (See Hegelian Dialectic and external threat), and that not only should the people live within its walls, but they should give him all their grain and other produce, plus any precious metals or gems, to hold in his protected bins for “security” (or rather, the illusion of safety). He even gave them a little clay tablet as a receipt that he told them could be traded for other goods. (Sound familiar?) But the people did as they were told because they were given a dose of fear. That is, until all the goods in © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 296 –"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"Nimrod's treasury were spent, leaving the city and its people bankrupt and open to invasion and defeat by the Persians. But still it left a genetic memory implant to fear a non-existent external threat. In the dark ages the feudal system trained us to fear the lord of the manor, who was, in turn, controlled by the church. The lord promised to protect his serfs from marauding bands of strangers (the fear factor) if they would work the land and give him all but a minuscule part of what they produce – just enough for the serfs to stay alive to be able to work the land next spring. If he sold his estate, they were considered part of the property – nothing more important than a plow. Education was repressed for the masses and allowed only to the gentry, lest the serfs discover the deception they had been enslaved under. The people did as they were told because they were given a dose of fear. That is, until the repression was so heavy that it gave rise to all manner of secret societies where scholars could freely discuss more enlightened ideas. But still it left a genetic memory implant to fear a non-existent external threat. The European Royalty did not bother inventing an outside entity for the people to fear. They taught their subjects to fear the kings and queens by the public execution of those who disobeyed their commandments. They used the guillotine or draw-and-quartering, and they made sure that the people watched the event. The people weren't there because they wanted to see the blood and gore, they were there because the were commanded to do so. So the people did as they were told, because they were given a dose of fear. That is, until the people had enough and revolted, overturning or changing the monarchies. But still it left a genetic memory implant to fear “authority”. © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 297 –"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"I'm going to use the term “Black Magic” here, but call it what you will – propaganda, mind control, group think, 100 th monkey, etc., it's all the same thing under different names. Regardless of whether or not you believe it or believe in it, it is what TBTP use, so it bears discussion. Under black magic rules, the subject of the malicious intent MUST ACQUIESCE FIRST. The victim must be in agreement on some level for the power to work. When you do not acquiesce, they have no power over you whatsoever. So the choice of being groped so you can travel by air or not is very important, but not in the ways you may think. Most will say “I need to travel for my job.” Others will say “I want to be able to visit Grandma for the holidays.” And still others figure it's a small price to pay to be able to go to Hawaii for vacation. But few really understand what is going on. The malicious, occult intent of all the enhanced security procedures is pure black magic being used against you. It doesn't matter to those who practice black magic whether you believe in it or not. For most of those who are employed by TPTB, they don't really believe in it either – they are just compartmentalized functionaries, being used to carry out an esoteric mission. But the choice is still the same: you can either go through the cancer causing scanners or the pervert grope line. Either way they've got you by the balls. And they have you by your own choice, your own acquiescence.

There is something far more valuable going on than your ability to have a job, to visit granny, to vacation in Hawaii. They really don't want you to know how much they've gotten you to give up. Nothing you possess is more valuable than your sacred choice. The most important thing TPTB try do you is make you forget that you have a choice. And they do it with fear. Those who allow this fear into their lives – with excuses like it's my job, my visit with relatives, my vacation – need to realize they are being deeply conditioned to acquiesce to the next piece of your humanity that TPTB want to take from you. TPTB are just waiting for you to say “please let me visit granny, please let me have my job, please let me have my vacation” or whatever carrot they dangle in front of you next, whatever next manufactured fear they have a solution for, waiting for you to acquiesce, to ask them to take your natural rights, so that you feel secure against whatever imaginary monster they have caused you to fear.

She said NO. She told her employer that she would not agree to being groped nor irradiated in order to fly. They sent another employee in her place. Her co- workers asked why going through the TSA was a problem for her. She said, “Because it's not a problem for you,” and then proceeded to educate them on what is going on around them. What sets these people apart in history is not only that they said NO, but that they continued to say NO in the face of adversity – even under extreme persecution, some even unto the threat of death.

Would You Recognize Kindness If You Saw It? Do you sit in traffic on the morning commute trying to get an inch ahead of the next guy, while he's trying to get an inch ahead of you? Would you consider fighting someone for a would-be holiday gift on Thanksgiving shopping day? Do you have to endeavor to keep your work noticed so that you get the promotion instead of your co-worker getting it? Are you sleepless many nights because your income doesn't quite cover your outgo? Are you so used to the dog-eat-dog world that you unconsciously nip at everyone around you? What happens when you are confronted with kindness? Can you shed that persona needed in what you call the “real world” long enough to accept it, much less return it? Do you take it as a sign of weakness and take advantage of the kind person? Does kindness confuse you? More and more people are noticing how badly kindness is dealt with. Apparently, it makes the receiver believe that the giver feels they owe something to the receiver. It is so strange to come across a kind person that it causes confusion and even suspicion. How tragic. In today's society, suspicion has been so ingrained in the masses that there is little room for kindness. We are told, “see something/say something,” and we are so well programmed with fear that we call the DHS at the slightest imagined provocation. Our children are taught that any “stranger [is a] danger” so thoroughly that any adult who attempts to have a civil conversation with a child, even in the presence of a parent, is immediately viewed as a pedophile. It is apparently now a crime to be kind to your neighbors by giving – yes, I said giving – them real food (that is, © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 302 –"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"garden produce, raw milk, etc.). But don't worry, it's still OK to buy frankenfoods! And if you are kind enough to your own body to want only whole, organic foods to nourish it, you are labeled an orthorexic, derived from the Greek word, orthorexia, literally meaning a correct diet, and now used to describe a “neurotic” behavior. Many so-called “acts of kindness” are merely disguised acts of self-servitude. An act of kindness done for it's direct reward (or for any reward for that matter) is not an act of kindness. But true kindness given does, indeed, reward the giver. Of course, rewards from acts of kindness are rarely seen in conjunction with the act itself. They happen when you are the one in need of kindness and it appears from out of the blue. Kindness – real kindness – can take many forms. It can be as simple as someone asking if you need some groceries brought from town, or some help building that new storage shed. Or it might be something you don't really need per se, but appreciate having. It's a jar of jelly or a listening ear when you needed one. But it always comes from someone caring enough about someone else (you) enough to know what might be needed or appreciated or make you smile, without being told or asked. Performing a kind act is one of those things that resonates on a higher frequency, a place in which you want to spend more time – another reward from “out of nowhere.”. Higher frequencies are where peace resides. Higher frequencies are where meditators and yogis strive to be. Higher frequencies allow us to connect with the universal energy – some call it ascension. Some of us feel we are so unworthy of kindness when we are offered it that we refuse it as a matter of course. But it is also a kindness to allow someone to be kind to you.

Get a Job Our commitment to living the survivalist lifestyle includes living so far off the beaten path as to make a daily commute to work impractical to say the least. And so, in monetary terms, we have been living on just a few hundred dollars a year. Someone, not understanding the essence of survivalism, suggested recently that we “get a job”. For their sake, as well as anyone else out there who thinks that living a survivalist life means transferring your suburban life to another location, here is my job description and “payment” schedule: 1. Collect firewood. Much of this is done by dragging fallen and standing dead pinion, cedar and juniper trees, later to be cut into correct sizes for the wood cook stove and the wood heating stove. That replaces our gas bill. 2. Keep the storage batteries full of water and check connections to the solar panels. That replaces our electric bill. 3. Do the laundry by the \"Armstrong” method. That is, wait until the rainwater barrels are full enough to wash and rinse the clothes by hand. More replacement of the electric bill. 4. Tend the garden and greenhouse. This is a 9 month a year job, and includes collecting manure from the pastures, turning the soil, planting the seeds, watering, removing bugs by hand, pulling weeds, © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 305 –"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"staking plants, pollinating as needed and harvesting. This replaces our food bill. 5. Tend the animals. This includes feeding the chickens, feeding the goats, feeding the cats and dog, providing them all with water, collecting eggs, milking and butchering. Also replaces our food bill. 6. Pumping water from the well to the storage tank by hand . This replaces our water bill. 7. We don't have phone service available here, so one of my tasks is to not jump when the phone doesn't ring. This negates our phone bill. 8. Use herbal and natural remedies for staying healthy. This replaces our medical bills. 9. Take time to enjoy the stunning scenery, the warmth of the sun, read a book, have conversations with loved ones, cook an exquisite dinner. This replaces psychiatrist bills. In my spare time , I write books, articles and podcasts, answer e-mailers' questions about living the survivalist lifestyle – and all before dark. I may be without money, but I'm not without value. And I certainly don't need a job. © 2012 www.survivingsurvivalism.com Page 306 –"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"XVII. 22 Things to Do Around Your Survivalist Homestead When It's Cloudy and You Don't Have Enough Solar Power to Surf the Internet We had an elongated “monsoon” season this year. It rained about 4 weeks longer than usual. And it stayed cloudy most of that time. This led to precious little time available to run the Internet modem, since the batteries weren't getting a direct sunlight charge during this rainy spell. So we had to find things to do other than surf! 1. Play cards 2. Scrape the burnt food from the kitchen wood stove top 3. Read a book 4. Increase the winter woodpile 5. Pump water into the holding tank from the well 6. Butcher a chicken for dinner 7. Collect juniper berries 8. Paint the wood trim 9. Bake an extra loaf of bread 10. Bring the extra loaf of bread to a neighbor 11. Take the dog on a hike 12. Take a luxurious bath 13. Write another chapter in your novel 14. Make whoopee 15. Dust behind the pictures 16. Mend socks 17. Make a kitchen planter box for herbs 18. Decide what you want to plant in next year's garden 19. Daydream 20. Sunbathe 21. Air out the pillows and blankets 22.

Sometimes in the middle of a conversation we decide to cook up something unusual (saueeed ground chicken meat marinated in ginger, mustard, sugar, leeks and vinegar this week) and have a feed.
