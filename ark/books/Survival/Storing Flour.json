[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"STORING FLOUR If you are actually serious about storing foods for your own survival, you MUST store whole wheat and a grain grinder! There simply is no substitute for long term storage of whole wheat that can be home ground into flour for cooking. But you can store any kind of flour by sealing it into bags (I use a small kitchen garbage bag), freezing at 0 F for 4 days, then storing it on a shelf or closet...it will keep for several years this way. To store wheat in small quantities, place a tall kitchen garbage bag into a 5 gallon bucket, fill with whole wheat, use a straw to remove all air, seal the bag, snap on the lid of the bucket, and freeze it for 4 days...it will last for decades this way. A normal (white) 5 gallon bucket is actually only about 4 gallons, and will hold 30 pounds of rice, 25 pounds of beans, or about 25 pounds of wheat. You should have at least 10 buckets filled with each of the above for each person."}]
