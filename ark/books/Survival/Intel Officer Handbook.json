Intelligence is the commander's decisionmaking tool. The commander, who drives intelligence, does so for planning before deployment, while enroute, and during operations and redeployment. The S2/NCOâ Provides the commander timely and accurate intelligence, IPB, I&W, and vulnerability assessments for force protection, targeting, and BDA. Makes decisive predictions on when and where an action will take place. Prioritizes IR. Integrates with other staff elements on I&S issues. Provides the commander with a view of all facets of the battlefield. Ensures his staff is trained. PURPOSE OF THIS HANDBOOK This manual does not replace the doctrine and TTP contained in the other FM 34-series manuals; it does, however, focus on their application. It also summarizes information that helps the S2 manage and coordinate the CCIR. It provides the S2 the roles and missions required for executing the intelligence support function. The G2/S2 is the âTop Downâ/âBottom Upâ integrator of RISTA operations, which have always been performed at the brigade and battalion levels. Three factors help to redefine traditional R&S planning: Top Down reporting. Bottom Up reporting. Digitization. Systems and technologies available to units make an integrated approach to managing âtop downâ and âbottom upâ reporting feasible. The ACT serves as the nexus of RISTA operations, digitally linking the brigade S2 with the automated capabilities of the DS MI company, resulting in RISTA operations which blend intelligence, R&S, and TA. (See FM 101-5 for G2/S2 responsibilities and Table 1-1 for RISTA collection resources.) Table 1-1.

There is no single method to support force projection. This chapter identifies key principles and considerations for planning and executing IEW force projection. Successful force projection of IEW support is based on understanding and applying the key principles shown in Figure 2-1. Other key force projection components are intelligence readiness and a requirement to define responsibilities each echelon performs down to the lowest tactical level. This chapter discussesâ Intelligence readiness. I&W. Stages of force projection operations (minus operations). Considerations are in a logical order but may not be sequential nor applicable for all force projection missions. Corps and division G2s must provide primary planning support for force projection operations because of their expertise. The S2 at each level identifiesâ Personal knowledge deficiencies (e.g., communications architecture, imagery dissemination systems and methods, ability to identify the staff's shortcomings)."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"FM 34-8-2 2-2 Technical limitations (e.g., ASAS, SIDS capability). Intelligence gaps with adequate specifics. INTELLIGENCE READINESS In a JTF force projection operation, higher echelons will provide intelligence for situation and target development to lower echelons (top down) until the tactical ground force completes entry and secures the lodgment area. The JTF J2 may be reluctant to push everything down through tactical intelligence channels due to the volume of the intelligence information available. The S2 may receive support on a âsmart pushâ basis, and needs to know his requirements to be able to do a âsmart pull.â The most significant change in the evolution of force projection operations is the enhanced information flow through hierarchical and non-hierarchical networks (computer, communications, and personal). The S2 shouldâ Review available databases on assigned contingency AIs; conduct IPB on these AIs; and develop appropriate IPB products. Be aware of higher HQ SOPs and DIA manuals for specific CM guidance. Prepare, practice, and conduct information collection activities as part of in-garrison IO rehearsals."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"FM 34-8-2 2-3 Preplan and practice an intelligence \"surge\" on likely contingency crises. Prepare and practice coordination from predeployment through redeployment with personnel from imagery, SIGINT, HUMINT, SWO, CA, PSYOP, and SF units, to include databases and connectivity. Ensure the following are a part of the daily operating environment: â RC and other augmentation. â Line numbers and SOPs including a linguist plan with proficiency scores (alert through early entry phases of deployment). â Training (individual and collective). Form ad hoc intelligence links and networks early on to meet a developing contingency. Incorporate, request, and receive intelligence from unfamiliar sources (linguists, MI augmentation, other services); exploit NGOs and PVOs once a crisis emerges. Exchange communications protocols with theater and higher HQ and subordinate and lateral units. Forward all RIIs to the higher HQ IAW SOPs. The J2, G2, and S2 can focus intelligence downward based on the commander's needs. Understand the JTF J2's multiple echelon and broadcast dissemination capability to ensure NRT reporting to all deployed, in transit, or preparing to deploy forces. Maintain an intelligence database on the battlefield environment and threats for each contingency. The S2 must state and record the CCIR as PIR, subordinate SOR, and SIR, and include the following: â For the battlefield environment, the commander's approval of the AI, to include separate ground, air, littoral waters, and political AIs. â Maps, terrain, and weather products. Request from National Imagery and Mapping Agency hard copies (unclassified or at the lowest classification). Request authority to declassify these products locally."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"FM 34-8-2 2-4 â Digitized products (map sheets for ASAS, terrain data, and imagery). â Physical environmental information. The TERRA BASE program allows S2s to template the effects of terrain on communications and direct fire. During mission analysis, TERRA BASE or other automated terrain productsâWINCATS, TOPOSKINNERâprovide the S2 a tool to help the commander visualize how terrain can affect friendly and enemy forces. These products can illuminate terrain effects for subordinate commanders in the OPORD brief. [Technique: Use the program at Home Station to develop and sustain proficiency.] The supporting engineer staff officer may also have terrain visualization products. â Threat or potential threats. The intelligence community, primarily the NGIC, and open sources produce products useful for intelligence readiness. These products can be tailored to best support the commander. (See FM 34-3 for information on intelligence analysis.) INTELLINK will be an S2's primary access to any type of requested strategic intelligence. Examples of strategic level products includeâ Global security forecast. Battlefield development plans. Automated and hardcopy databases. Arms proliferation and military power studies related to the weapons acquisition strategies and the overall military power and potential of selected foreign military forces. TECHINT and User Bulletins. CIA World Fact Book and DIA country studies. Open source studies and articles. Other services. INDICATIONS AND WARNINGS Theater and national intelligence units monitor regional and global threats to"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"FM 34-8-2 2-5 provide I&W intelligence to the NCA and military commanders. I&W intelligence flows to strategic, operational, and tactical commanders; it prevents surprise, reduces risk, and supports development and refinement of CONPLANs. The S2 must ensure the commander identifies PIR, IR, and targeting requirements for each assigned contingency area. The S2 shouldâ Conduct CM and synchronization planning on I&W requirements. Review your unit's collection plan and preplanned SOR for each contingency area. If necessary, refine existing collection plans and SOR. Review and modify reporting procedures for I&W contingency areas. This may involve changing intelligence reporting (e.g., increasing reporting on one area and decreasing reporting on another) and message routing addresses and precedence (e.g., FLASH designation). Prioritize and forward SOR to higher headquarters. Disseminate intelligence and information to the commander, staff, and subordinate units. Coordinate for direct dissemination when possible. Recommend to the commander whether to maintain or increase unit readiness levels; plan and surge the intelligence effort for the impending operation; or move the unit from its current mission to contingency, branch, or subsequent operations. Adjust intelligence readiness steps according to pre-crisis I&W. STAGES OF FORCE PROJECTION OPERATIONS REMINDER: All phases of the intelligence cycle are being executed continuously during all stages of force projection. MOBILIZATION: Mobilization is a process in which the armed forces augment the AC capability in preparation for war or other national emergencies. It includes activating all or part of the RC assembling and organizing personnel, supplies, and materiel; and certifying the proficiency of individuals and units."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"FM 34-8-2 2-6 (See FM 100-17 for mobilization process.) In peacetime, AC and RC MI units plan, train, and prepare together to accomplish mobilization and deployment tasks. During the mobilization phase, the S2 shouldâ Assist the mobilizing RC unit by preparing and conducting intelligence training and threat update briefings and by disseminating intelligence. Identify force requirements for the different types of operations and CONPLANs. Employ and adhere to existing procedures. If possible, use prior coordinated IMAs to fill gaps created by personnel shortages. These IMAs should already have a working knowledge of your SOPs and understand the mission. Monitor intelligence reporting on threat activity and I&W indicators. Conduct or coordinate CI and OPSEC training and operations. Manage IR and RII from your unit and subordinate units. Evaluate reporting. Update collection planning. PREDEPLOYMENT ACTIVITY: Predeployment activity provides the foundation for subsequent force projection operations. I&W will continue throughout force projection operations. The S2 must perform IPB early and continuously. (See FM 33-1, FM 34-130, FM 41-10.) Accelerated training will ensure all AC and RC MI units are able to conduct IEW operations. Integrate mobilization and deployment tasks into unit METL and training; emphasize and integrate critical aspects of force projection into battle tasks and planning. Focus broadbased knowledge to support CONPLAN refinement (IPB)."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"FM 34-8-2 2-7 Ensure tactical tailoring or split-based operation planning is based on an existing CONPLAN. Establish appropriate relationships; establish higher, lower, and lateral liaisons if they are different. Continuously conduct and update CM and IEW synchronization planning. â IO synchronization ensures IO are linked to the CCIR and respond in time to influence decisions and operations. IO encompasses more than just MI assets and requires MI support. (See FM 34-40 and FM 100-6.) â IEW synchronization ensures IEW operations are linked to the CCIR and respond in time to influence decisions and operations. IEW is a subset of IO. â The commander generates CCIR. CCIR focus on what is critical. They should change as the situation changes. CCIR affect PIR, IR, EEFI, and FFIR. Plan imagery coverage for target nomination, validation, and PSA. Require from collection assets, timelines for preplanned and dynamic collection requests. Plan synchronization through all five steps of the intelligence cycle. Ensure each PIR is related to a specific operational decision. (See FM 34-2 and FM 100-6.) Prepare an ISM and backward plan so collection production efforts are executed with the operation; deliver focused intelligence to support operational decisions. Coordinate with the S3 and signal officer for EW offensive and electronic deception operations, specifically for target nomination, no-fire target criteria, protected frequencies, and synchronized EW effort during all phases of the operation. Plan BDA requirements. Refine, manage, and update SOR. Monitor and maintain synchronization."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"FM 34-8-2 2-8 Anticipate and initiate collection early against long lead-time requirements. Ensure CCIR process is continuous and the intelligence cycle and IEW operations remain tied to the commander's decisions and concept of operations. Identify collection gaps after you synthesize available information on the AO and coordinate the collection efforts of existing intelligence organizations. (Consider national, EAC, other US forces and services, and HN support.) Develop a collection strategy which factors PIR, IR, and METT-TC. Submit RII and other requests for support to adjacent, higher, and HN units. Develop a collection plan which supports all PIR and IR and maintains synchronization. Develop your intelligence team: â Commander's intelligence support : The S2 and supporting MI commander form the maneuver commander's intelligence team. ASAS is the primary intelligence processing system supporting this team. A unit may need to augment its S2 staff, to include area experts, TECHINT LNOs, linguists, interrogators, intelligence analysts, and CI agents. Tailor the size and sophistication of the deploying unit's intelligence staff to the mission. â ACT : The DS MI company provides an ACT to support the commander's intelligence team at brigade. â Additional attachments : These could include PSYOP and CA. â DISE : This is a small intelligence support team that provides communications, automated intelligence fusion, and broadcast downlinks in a small package capable of deploying with Army early entry forces. Decide whether you will form the DISE from the organic assets of the early entry force or from the corps ACE, supporting EAC MI brigade, or a combination thereof. Plan the configuration, which can range from \"briefcases\" (Mini- DISE) to HMMWVs (DISE vehicular), and are normally staffed by 5 to 12 soldiers, respectively. Build the supporting hardware systems around the Armyâs ASAS and integrate them with other Army, joint intelligence, and communication capabilities."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"FM 34-8-2 2-9 Plan whether the DISE will expand to a full ACE as lodgment operations are completed or will disband once the mission is accomplished. Plan situations in which the DISE will go directly to higher headquarters for information without the home base's approval. Plan on requirements to support the DISE with 24-hour operations. â ISB : This is the rear element of split-based operations that provides processed and analyzed intelligence to the DISE. Plan the automation, communications capacity, and personnel necessary to provide continuous intelligence requirements management, collection, processing, and reporting. Plan all procedures for the DISE to \"pull\" specific intelligence products and reports, obtain status of collection, and \"push\" the current intelligence picture from the lodgment back to the ARFOR and JTF commanders if not in theater. â Plan all links to higher intelligence organizations, including the JIC and the elements designed to leverage theater intelligence; focus on support down to the corps and echelons below corps (e.g., the CMISE). â Coordinate with and understand the capabilities of the JTF to include the NIST if formed. â Plan to use RC augmentation. Some examples are a mix of CI agents, UAVs, interrogators, and linguists. Transportation availability (aircraft or naval vessel) for deployment. Sustainability. Portability once deployed. Disciplined operations. The commander's ability to collect may be affected by nonmilitary decisionmakers. The CINC can contribute to the deploying commander by ensuring at the outset that intelligence is decompartmented and releasable to allied units (if"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"FM 34-8-2 2-10 applicable). â Review applicable publications (ARs, DA Pamphlets, USSIDs). â Review SOFAs, ROE, international laws, and other agreements. (Coordinate with SJA on these issues.) â Review applicable NIMA guidance.  â Establish force deployment priorities based upon METT-T. Sequence initial required forces and capabilities, build-up priorities, and follow-on forces to ensure a sequenced plan, a tailored force, and established command and support relationships. Consider sensors, processors, preprocessors, CI, and HUMINT. Maintain unit integrity. â Plan communications architecture (build redundancy when possible). Remember toâ Plan links to the JTF DISE, if formed, that complements the NIST. (See FM 34-25-3 and FM 34-37). Ensure intelligence links provide the early entry commander vital access to multisource Army and joint intelligence collection assets, processing systems, and databases. â Ensure collection is synchronized with production, and intelligence is still synchronized with operations (specify reporting procedures and timelines). â Finalize the IEW OPLAN (terrain and communications deconfliction). Coordinate with the MI commander on his tactical decisionmaking process. Understand the MI commander's SOR that are his specified tasks, implied tasks, task organization, concept of operation (the organization, deployment, allocation, and employment of subordinate MI units), and coordination requirements with forward maneuver units. â Establish the intelligence crossover point. Estimate the time and establish a measurable criteria to indicate when you have reached that point. Intelligence crossover occurs when enough tactical collection assets are in theater to reduce the dependency upon strategic"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"FM 34-8-2 2-11 or national assets.

S2s should inform commanders and operators on CI and MDCI analysis. Train your MDCI analysts to conduct reverse IPB and think like the enemy S2, to include the enemy's perception of friendly centers of gravity and how he will attack or influence them. Incorporate your MDCI analysis into the G2/J2 situation and decision briefings and all planning (especially deception planning). Assign CI and MDCI sections appropriate missions and analytical responsibilities, such as rear area threat analysis, and continuously assess effectiveness. â Identify potential countermeasures to deny the enemy access to friendly critical areas. â Identify and recommend actions to counter enemy intelligence collection capabilities. â Implement the following controls to support force projection: Establish access to national HUMINT and CI databases, automated links to joint service, coalition, and HN sources to help identify, assess, and develop countermeasures for threats. Develop FLASH precedence reporting procedures."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"FM 34-8-2 2-13 Receive and disseminate CI information and specific CI tasks from ASAS and other means such as the CHATS. Support further CONPLAN and OPLAN development. MI units continually monitor and update their CONPLANs to reflect the evolving situation, especially during crises. Immediately before deployment, update deploying forces with the most recent intelligence on the AO and update your technical databases and situation graphics. Develop contingency tailored packages that allow the G2/S2 to place the right force support teams in a deployable posture with an adequate amount of training. DEPLOYMENT: Success in force projection operations hinges on the capability of airlift and sealift assets to move forces into the AO. Force protection is more critical during this stage. Monitor intelligence reporting on threat activity and I&W indicators. Continuously conduct and update IEW, CM, and synchronization planning. Plan enroute updates to eliminate information voids and allow your commander to adjust OPLANs prior to arrival in theater. Request supporting intelligence organizations use SATCOM, broadcast technology, and ADP systems to provide graphic and textual intelligence updates while enroute. Continue IPB. Provide timely, accurate, and specific infrastructure and weather information. IMETS can provide weather information. Use accurate situation development to help the commander understand and reduce risk on the battlefield. Use the DST, collection plan, R&S plan, ISM, and SOR to anticipate which decisions the commander and staff will make."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"FM 34-8-2 2-14 ENTRY OPERATIONS: During initial entry operations, EAC organizations provide major intelligence support in a \"smart push\" mode. This support may include departmental, joint, and scalable Army intelligence elements capable of deploying forward. Entry units must continue to \"smart pull\" the intelligence they need for operations. Continue to conduct force protection planning. Monitor the buildup of the in-theater capability required to conduct sustained IEW operations and to reduce your total dependence on split-based, \"top driven\" intelligence from outside the AO. As organic IEW assets flow into the theater, assess their reliability for tactical intelligence. (National and theater organizations will still remain sources of strategic intelligence.) Determine intelligence crossover point. Monitor intelligence reporting on threat activity and I&W indicators. â Routinely debrief troops. â Use local nationals employed by or in frequent contact with your force to provide information (area experts must analyze it). Ensure liaison personnel and basic communications are in place prior to the scheduled arrival of parent commands. â Deploy HUMINT forces into theater as early as possible. â Contact HN or civil authority.

WAR TERMINATION AND POSTCONFLICT OPERATIONS: Upon cessation of hostilities or truce, deployed forces transition to a period of postconflict operations. Commanders redirect PIR and IR to support units conducting restoration operations (e.g., engineer units conducting infrastructure reconstruction operations, medical and logistics units providing humanitarian relief). The nature of the PIR shifts from assessing threat forces to assessing political, economic, social, religious, and other conditions that affect force protection and the desired end-state; planning residual presence of US forces; and preparing for redeployment of forces."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"FM 34-8-2 2-16 Continue to conduct force protection planning.

Use pre-deployment tactical tailoring procedures to plan a phased redeployment of IEW assets and personnel ensuring continual coverage of the commander's requirements. REDEPLOYMENT AND RECONSTITUTION: As the combat power and resources decrease in the AO, force protection and I&W become the focus of the CCIR. This drives the selection of those MI units that must remain deployed and those which may redeploy. Monitor intelligence reporting on threat activity and I&W indicators. Continue to conduct force protection planning. Request intelligence BOS support (theater and national systems) and provide intelligence in support of redeployment and reconstitution (reverse intelligence crossover point).

The MDMP is a single, established, and proven analytical technique. The commander must follow the one- third/two-thirds planning rule. MDMP helps the commander and staff examine a battlefield situation and reach logical decisions. The commander can decide to use the complete or abbreviated version. Staffs should train on both the complete and abbreviated versions. Incomplete execution of the MDMP is a recurring deficiency at the CTCs. Intelligence in the MDMP MDMP is based on continuous IPB, especially initial IPB during mission analysis. The commander drives intelligence; IPB is an integrated staff function driven by the commander. Train your section to conduct IPB so you can coordinate closely with other staff and BOS representatives. You must understand how all the BOS operate and how to integrate intelligence during planning, especially within the targeting process IAW FM 6-20-10. \" Push \" the staff to develop a robust and integrated R&S plan. Staff Estimates FM 101-5 provides a generic staff estimate. The generic staff estimate is the base for the commander's operations, personnel, intelligence, logistics, CMO, communications, and special staff estimates. These staff estimates are designed to form, analyze, compare, and recommend friendly COAs. Staff estimates are continuous, must not be overly time consuming, and do not have to be a written product (time dependent). The wargame results and staff estimates help the staff compare COAs. The Intelligence Estimate The purpose, scope, and content of the intelligence estimate changed with draft of FM 101-5. The old intelligence estimate was a text-based product derived from IPB that focused on ECOAs, capabilities, strengths, and vulnerabilities. This old intelligence estimate is functionally replaced by IPB products. A standard staff estimate prepared by the G2/S2 is the new intelligence estimateâit is radically different. The new intelligence estimate focuses on the G2/S2's ability to support friendly COAs and is used to compare and approve friendly COAs."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"FM 34-8-2 3-2 Step 1: Receipt of Mission The mission comes from higher headquarters or is derived from an ongoing mission. On receipt of a new mission, the G3/S3 issues a WARNO to the staff. The staff immediately prepares for mission analysis (SOP preparation). Immediately the commander and staff do a quick initial assessment with emphasis on an initial allocation of available time. The commander issues his initial guidance, and the G3/S3 issues a WARNO to subordinate units. Intelligence in Step 1 Collaborate with your higher G2/S2 before and during receipt of mission to facilitate the initial IPB. As part of the initial assessment, look for gaps in your intelligence database and products. Proactively request/prepare terrain products, weather, light, and climatology data; update the MCOO and doctrinal templates; maintain the enemy situation. Focus on the initial time allocation (complete or full MDMP), R&S guidance, and any additional tasks or focus from the commander's initial guidance. Establish/verify an IHL. Step 2: Mission Analysis 1. Analyze the higher HQ order. (If confused by or you disagree with it, seek immediate clarification or resolution.) 2. Conduct initial IPB. 3. Determine specified, implied, and essential tasks. (It is important to understand specific requirements for each task.) 4. Determine the AI. 5. Review available assets. (The staff must identify additional resources needed to ensure the mission's success.) 6. Determine constraints (normally found in the scheme of maneuver, concept of the operation, and coordinating instructions). 7. Identify critical facts and assumptions. (List all appropriate assumptions from higher; state relevant conditions over which the commander has no control.) 8. Conduct risk assessment. 9. Determine initial CCIR. (Limit to 10 or less.)

Start the subsequent steps of CM & intelligence synchronization (FM 34-2) to support the initial collection plan (at a minimum SII, SIR, and SOR). The R&S plan is a coordinated staff effort that must include FS, MEDEVAC, and CONPLANs (e.g., what the brigade does if 2 key scout sections are destroyed). The MI Bn/DS MI Co participates in mission analysis and briefs the collection status and capabilities. Step 3: COA Development 1. Analyze relative combat power. See FM 34-130 for estimating relative-force ratios. 2. Generate options. Goal is to develop COAs for every feasible ECOA; however, the commander usually limits that option with his guidance. 3. Array initial forces. Identify number of units needed and operational methods; develop a knowledge base to help make decisions. 4. Develop the scheme of maneuver. 5. Assign headquarters.

The commander selects the order of comparison of threat to friendly COAs. The staff must evaluate the need for branches and sequels. When technically possible, the staff should capture as much of the wargame on ATCCS as possible; otherwise, use a wargame worksheet or ISM. These wargame results are key to developing DSTs and BOS synch matrix. Use the action, reaction, counteraction method (consider at a minimum maneuver, FS, mobility, counter- mobility, survivability, and IEW). The staff should track force ratios throughout the wargame.

Only the accelerated technique is discussed herein because it is the most difficult to implement. (See CALL Newsletter Update No. 95-12.) The accelerated technique may be used when one or more of the following conditions apply: Commander has a staff available to assist him in developing the plan, but little time to use a more formal process. Commander does not have a staff, or the staff is not accessible. When these conditions apply, the commander must rely primarily on TLP to develop his plan. The accelerated technique assists the commander in developing a tentative plan. Under extreme circumstances, this may be little more than a mental process; nonetheless, the commander can use it to assist him and key staff members (S2/S3/FSO/XO) as he develops his plan. The accelerated technique follows the basic procedures in the deliberate and abbreviated processes, but the differences are more significant. The major differences between the abbreviated and accelerated techniques involve the commander's guidance and the COA development phase (Figure 3-1). The accelerated technique is characterized by active participation by the commander, and development of one COA that is suitable, feasible, and flexible. In some situations, the products developed using the accelerated technique may be the same as those developed when using the deliberate or abbreviated technique. Because time is the key factor, the accelerated technique will normally result in the development of a FRAGO. "},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"     FM 34-8-2 3-7 MISSION ANALYSIS: ISSUE: The commander and staff must be able to rapidly conduct the mission analysis to determine the restated mission. DISCUSSION: When using the deliberate or abbreviated technique, the staff conducts a detailed mission analysis to develop the restated mission. As previously stated, resorting to a mental process in lieu of a detailed restated mission is acceptable; however, this should be the exception rather than the norm. The staff may be forced to brief their initial estimates orally, without the use of charts or viewgraphs. Conduct as formal a mission analysis as time allows. During the mission analysis, there are no major differences between the three techniques. There are no techniques that will significantly reduce the amount of time required to conduct the mission analysis. Anticipation, prior preparation, and experience by the staff are the keys to a timely mission analysis process. TECHNIQUES:"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"FM 34-8-2 3-8 Commander must get personally involved by supervising and managing the mission analysis process. In extreme situations, the staff must be prepared to brief the commander without the use of visual aids. COA DEVELOPMENT: ISSUE: When time is severely limited, providing the commander's guidance after the mission analysis may not be the most appropriate time. DISCUSSION: Instead, the commander may decide to immediately begin personally developing one COA with input from selected staff officers. There is probably not time to seek input from every staff officer, so the commander must determine relevant and critical staff officers (e.g., S2, F3, FSO, XO). This team may vary depending on the type of mission. For example: In the defense include staff engineer. During SASO include CA, PAO, SJA, PSYOP. In other situations, include subordinate commanders because of their experience. This team must then quickly develop a flexible COA to accomplish the mission. The key to success, when using the accelerated technique, is to rapidly develop a base plan with appropriate branches that is flexible, feasible, suitable, and acceptable. DO NOT WORRY ABOUT DEVELOPING THE PERFECT COA; THERE IS NOT TIME FOR IT . This is the major distinction between the accelerated technique and the others. Once the COA is developed, the commander might consider conducting a hasty wargame. In extreme situations, this may be the only opportunity to conduct the wargame process. Next, the commander should begin to quickly develop his guidance to the staff. The accelerated technique is characterized by an active role of the commander, and very specific guidance to the staff. TECHNIQUES:"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"     FM 34-8-2 3-9 Focus on developing one COA with branch plans that is flexible, feasible, suitable, and acceptable. The commander plays the central role when developing this COA. COMMANDER'S GUIDANCE: Once the commander has developed the COA, he must issue guidance to his staff so it can refine and wargame the COA. The commander's guidance to the staff must be directive and specific. The staff's responsibility is to support the commander's plan, not to develop the perfect plan. Well- developed and clearly communicated commander's guidance can be a significant timesaver. The commander's guidance should serve to keep the staff focused by establishing parameters to work within. Commander's guidance must be constantly reviewed and analyzed. As the situation changes and information becomes available, the commander may have to alter his guidance to the staff. COA ANALYSIS: ISSUE. The commander and staff must rapidly conduct the COA analysis process. DISCUSSION: Conducting the wargame process using the accelerated technique is the most difficult of the three processes because only one COA was developed. The purpose of the COA analysis is not to analyze and compare multiple COAs that result in a recommendation to the commander, but to synchronize and integrate the commander's directed COA. This wargame session should focus on refining the branches or contingencies to the base plan and follow the formal wargame process as much as time allows. Focus on the most critical events. You do not have time to wargame the entire operation. When wargaming using the accelerated technique, the commander's involvement is even more important. The staff should use the box technique, focusing on actions at the objective or the engagement area. If time permits, wargame other critical events as well. The staff must work to support the commander's plan. However, as the staff works to refine the plan, it cannot become so biased that it develops a plan that is infeasible and insupportable. If the staff determines that it cannot support the commander's plan, then a new COA must be developed."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"FM 34-8-2 3-10 TECHNIQUES: If time permits, conduct a hasty wargame session during the COA development step. Ensure you identify and develop branches to the base plan. Involve the commander. He must supervise the wargame session, actively participate, make decisions, and provide guidance as required. Use the box technique, focusing on the most critical event first. DECISION: When using the accelerated technique, a decision brief is not required because only one COA was developed. The only decision that may be required is if the developed COA becomes unsuitable, infeasible, or unacceptable. If this occurs, another COA must be developed. ADVANTAGES: Requires less time. Facilitates adaptation to a rapidly changing situation. Allows commander to compensate for lack of a staff or an experienced staff. DISADVANTAGES: Significantly limits staff initiative and flexibility. Very directive, explores only one friendly COA.

RECONNAISSANCE PLANNING While the DMP for reconnaissance operations is conducted in the same manner as for any other combat operation, the following steps will assist the reconnaissance planner in ensuring that the unique features of reconnaissance operations are addressed. Reconnaissance Mission Analysis Identify Reconnaissance Objectives. Reconnaissance mission analysis must identify the objectives of the unit's reconnaissance effort. These objectives are obtained fromâ - PIR. - DPs. - HPTs/HVTs. - Confirming Events. (These are enemy actions and counteractions that confirm an ECOA and are determined by event analysis.) The reconnaissance planner may determine that some of the above requirements may be accomplished by RFIs to higher HQ, but all of those that are not must become reconnaissance objectives. Identify Reconnaissance AO. Reconnaissance planners identify the area in which reconnaissance forces will be operating, either specified by control measures such as LOAs or CFLs or implied by the location of reconnaissance objectives. Restate Reconnaissance Missions. Once reconnaissance objectives have been determined, the mission for each element of the unit reconnaissance force must be determined from task analysis and stated as a subunit task. The task analysis processâdetermining specified, implied, and essential reconnaissance tasks and identifying limitations and constraintsâis described in FM 101-5. Reconnaissance missions will be determined to be reconnaissance-in-force or zone, area, route, or force-oriented reconnaissance missions. Identify Available Reconnaissance Force. Reconnaissance planners must identify the subunits that are available to execute the unit's reconnaissance effort and their current and projected status."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"FM 34-8-2 4-9 Table 4-4. Mission planning sequence (continued) . Identify Available Equipment. Reconnaissance planners must identify the equipment available in an FMC status that will be used by elements of the reconnaissance force to accomplish reconnaissance tasks. RCOA Development Identify Required Reconnaissance Force. Reconnaissance planners must identify the force required to accomplish the unit's reconnaissance objectives. The number and type of elements involved will be based on the following: - Number, type, location, and sequencing of reconnaissance objectives. Some objectives will require constant surveillance. Some will be time-phased and need only be observed for part of the battle. Some elements of the  reconnaissance force will be able to accomplish several reconnaissance objectives. - Type of reconnaissance mission. A route reconnaissance will require a different element than a reconnaissance-in-force. - Strength, composition, and disposition of enemy security force. For each element of the reconnaissance force, the decision will have to be made whether it will have to infiltrate or penetrate the enemy security force. Infiltrations dictate stealthy elements and techniques while penetrations will require the correct reconnaissance force ratio. Identify Required Equipment. Each reconnaissance objective will require specific reconnaissance equipment based on the following: - Proximity of the reconnaissance element to the objective. What is the effective observation range? - Environmental conditions. What will be the impact of severe weather? Night? - Signature provided by the target. Does it emit a signal? Heat? Does it need to talk to anyone? Determine the Reconnaissance Scheme. The RCOA must ensure that all reconnaissance objectives are addressed by elements of the reconnaissance force that can provide the read on the objective required by the commander. The reconnaissance force must therefore be in the right place, at the right time, and with the right observation, communications, and force protection equipment. The RCOA must deploy the reconnaissance force in depth to ensure that contact is not lost with moving reconnaissance targets. It must identify reconnaissance objectives that cannot be addressed so that RFIs may be prepared or risk accepted. In developing the RCOA, reconnaissance planners must answer the following questions: - Are all PIR, HPT, DP, and confirming events addressed as reconnaissance objectives or RFI? - What role will other BOS/combat operations play in the reconnaissance scheme? â¢ FS (to include EA and SEAD for air insertions/extractions). â¢ Air defense. â¢ Mobility/counter-mobility. â¢ CSS. â¢ Deception. â¢ OPSEC. - How will this RCOAâ â¢ Maintain focus on the reconnaissance effort? â¢ Gain and maintain contact with reconnaissance targets? â¢ Provide early warning? - How will we ensure that reconnaissance operations remain the bde/TF initial main effort?"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"FM 34-8-2 4-10 Table 4-4.

What are the control measures? - How will fire support be integrated into this RCOA? Determine Task Organization, C Relationships. Once the reconnaissance force 2 and its associated equipment are determined, it must be task organized to accomplish the RCOA in the most efficient manner. The C structure must address unity of effort 2 by identifying the COR. The COR must have the control structure and authority to direct the reconnaissance force. Reconnaissance operations often take place over large distances and long periods of time where communications systems are subject to attack. The communications plan will require careful attention to the use of retransmitted teams and redundant systems. Identify Control Measures. While reconnaissance operations require the same positive control measures as any other, some require special attention. - LOA. This measure identifies the forward edge of the reconnaissance battlespace and is usually associated with a CFL or FSCL. - BHL. Reconnaissance forces operate throughout the unit's AO, but must be able to coordinate the acceptance of reconnaissance targets entering their battlespace with the unit to their front. - TF Forward Boundary. In brigade operations there will often be a need to identify a brigade zone forward of the subordinate maneuver TFs. Determine CSS Requirements: - Resupply: How often, by whom, where, how? - CasEvac: By whom, how? - Reconstitution: From where will reconstituted reconnaissance forces come? What are the priorities? RCOA Analysis and Wargaming Key Events to Wargame During Analysis of an RCOA: - Infiltration or penetration of the enemy security force. - Insertion/extraction methods. - Backup communications plan. - CasEvac operations. - Change in reconnaissance objectives based on new information. - Handover of reconnaissance target leaving reconnaissance unit's LOS or AO.

Reason: Shorter overall mission time, less fuel needed, more payload or  ordnance. â Exceptions which cause deviation from this rule: * Heavy concentrations of air defense. * Major terrain features that can mask the approach of aircraft at low altitudes. * Terrain that may force unnecessary exposure. * Terrain exceeding the operating ceiling of rotary-wing aircraft. â What happens in the vicinity of the target? * Most attacking aircraft will drop lower to use terrain masking and minimize early warning and exposure times to associated air defenses. * How will the enemy aircraft approach the target (Hi-Hi-Lo, Lo-Hi-Lo, or Lo-Lo-Hi, etc)? * To engage the target the pilot must be able to see it (visual, radar, sensor). * The pilot must approach his target so he can see it at far enough distance to allow lock-on and engagement by his weapon system. * The pilot will maximize his standoff range to increase survivability. â How to determine the direction of attack: * Know the enemy HPT; what friendly asset he must destroy. * Know the location of these assets. * Know the location of known or suspected enemy airbases and FARP.

The most important part of determining enemy air COAs is to understand the ground situation and enemy ground COAs. With the information and analysis you've done in the first three steps, determine how the enemy will employ his air assets. Consider enemy doctrine, AAAs, terrain in the target area, and current weather conditions. You must answer the following questions: â When will the enemy commit his air assets? â Where will the enemy commit his air assets (target area)? â What air assets will the enemy commit (number of aircraft)? â How will the aircraft attack in the target area (AAA or delivery profile)?

Subordinate units plan the use of available R&S assets to satisfy taskings from the brigade and their own requirements. They strive to complete their plans quickly (using the 1/3, 2/3 rule) so R&S assets have time to prepare and execute the plan.

PIR may change in order or be replaced entirely. IR are requirements for intelligence to fill a gap in the commandâs knowledge and understanding of the battlefield or threat forces. They target specific COAs. Indicators are positive or negative evidence of threat activity or any AO characteristic which points toward threat vulnerabilities or adoption or rejection by the threat of a particular capability, or which may influence the commanderâs selection of a COA. During wargaming, the S2 develops a set of PIR for each friendly COA. Each is linked to a specific enemy action that requires a friendly response (DPs). PIR are those IR critical to accomplishing the mission. Wargaming will dictate which IR will become PIR as the mission runs its course. The S2 should nominate PIR for approval ONLY FROM THE LIST OF ALREADY PLANNED AND COORDINATED IR. EXAMPLE OF A POOR PIR: \"Will the enemy attack? If so, how, when, where, and in what strength?\" The PIR contains five significantly different questions. Which one is the priority? Unless the S2 gives more guidance, the individual collector must determine which part of this PIR to work. The S2 probably knows more about the situation than \"the enemy might attack somehow, sometime, somewhere, and in some strength.\" The PIR as stated might prompt some collection assets to collect known information."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"FM 34-8-2 D-2 Even for issues that the S2 does not know, the enemy can only select from a limited range of COAs due, for example, to terrain, weather, policies. If the PIR consider IPB, the S2, through more specific tasking, will minimize the chance that collection assets will look for the enemy where they are not likely to be. When the staff wargames, it may find some aspects of this question to be irrelevant to the present situation. For example, the defense may be fully capable of defeating an enemy attack regardless of when they actually attack. Why waste collection assets on a question that does not need to be answered? EXAMPLE OF A GOOD PIR: There is no \"set\" of PIR we can present that will be useful for all tactical situations any more than there is a set of maneuver paragraphs that the S3 can plug into any OPORD. Below are examples of types of PIR the S2 presents to the commander for approval. Because intelligence needs change over time, most PIR will be important only during certain times. Referring to PIR as \"timephased\" is redundant. They are dynamic just as the battle will be dynamic. Just as there are no standard situation templates or friendly COAs that will serve in all situations, there is no standard set of PIR. Good PIR, however, have some things in common: They ask only one question. They focus on a specific fact, event, or activity. They provide intelligence required to support a single decision. They are tied to key decisions that the commander has to make. They give an LTIOV. Examples: \"Will the enemy defend OBJ JAMES using a forward slope defense?\" What size force is defending OBJ NACO?\" Which bridges over the San Pedro River are intact?\" Not all PIR are appropriate as questions, particularly those associated with moving targets or formations. PIR are requirements and should be stated as such when appropriate. In addition, PIR for moving targets must include the requirement to continue to maintain contact with the target. Simply locating the target once will not prevent it from surprising the commander later. Example: \"Locate and track the enemy's battalion reserve.\""},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"  FM 34-8-2 E-1 APPENDIX E GRAPHIC REPORT FORMATS Intelligence personnel use a variety of formats to request, report, and disseminate information (see FM 34-3). Personnel working in a joint environment should use JCS Pub 6-04.11. The formats assimilate information into automated intelligence support systems, such as the ASAS. This appendix concentrates on graphic report formats, specifically the graphic INTSUM and the graphic intelligence estimate. The INTSUM is the main focus, but a graphic intelligence estimate is also provided. GRAPHIC INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY The graphic INTSUM is used by units at all echelons to rapidly convey threat situation dynamics. The graphic INTSUM is a current depiction of significant threat dispositions, activities, strengths, and weaknesses and an assessment of the most probable ECOA. A current, complete graphic INTSUM will provide for efficient collection and enable the commander to exploit fleeting threat vulnerabilities. The graphic INTSUM can be maintained on conventional maps of any scale as an overlay or created electronically and disseminated to computer and television screens. For example, army-level organizations may utilize a 1:250,000 map scale and focus on an army or front-level threat, whereas in SASO activities the deployed unit may utilize a map scale of 1:25,000 or smaller and focus on a platoon or company-size threat. The graphic INTSUM (Figure E-1) may contain 12 components: Legend and margin information. Area orientation. Threat unit locations and mission activities. Threat mission capabilities assessment.

The purpose of targeting is to disrupt, delay, or limit threat interference with friendly COAs; it requires coordinated interaction between FS operations, intelligence, EW, and plans cells. Targeting is based on the enemyâs assets that provide him an advantage (HPTs), friendly scheme of maneuver, and tactical plans. (See FM 6-20-10. ) Target development is one of the six IEW tasks. Mission analysis must precede generating any ECOAs. These ECOAs are the starting point for all other staff actions to wargame against, and to develop follow-on products. The products of the decide function are briefed to the commander. Upon his approval, his decisions are translated into the OPORD with annexes. (See FM 34-130.) METHODOLOGY Decisions create the guidelines for the acquisition and engagement of targets. TA and attack are made through a decision cycle.

STEP 1 - DECIDE:"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"FM 34-8-2 F-6 DECIDE provides the overall focus and sets priorities for intelligence collection and attack planning (Figure F-4). Targeting priorities must be addressed for each phase or critical event of an operation. The decisions made are reflected in visual products as follows: HPTL is a prioritized list of HPTs whose loss to the enemy will contribute to the success of the friendly COA. Intelligence collection plan, or R&S plan, answers the commanderâs PIR, to include those HPTs designated as PIR. The plan, within the availability of additional collection assets, supports the acquisition of more HPTs. Determining the intelligence requirements is the first step in the CM process. (See FMs 34-2 and 34-2-1.) TSS matrix addresses accuracy or other specific criteria that must be met before targets can be attacked. AGM, approved by the commander, addresses which targets will be attacked, how, when, and the desired effects. The formats for the HPTLs, TSS, and AGMs are examples only. Targeting personnel must understand all that is involved in building these targeting tools. However, experienced staffs may prefer to develop their own tailored formats. IPB and Mission Analysis . IPB, including EPB, is a continuous process and starts in the preparation phase. It continues to provide updated as well as new products and supports the targeting process. The intelligence estimate provides key support to target development. MCOOs, doctrinal, situation, event, and DSTs help identify ECOAs, NAIs, TAIs, HVTs. TVA and Wargaming . The battlefield environment, its effects on combatants, and the threat are considered in IPB analysis to arrive at an intelligence estimate. TVA yields HVTs for a specific ECOA. Target spreadsheets identify the HVTs in relation to a type of operation, and target sheets (see FM 6-20-10, App A) give detailed targeting information for each HVT. This information is used during the IPB and the wargame processes. Both tools are developed by the G2 ASPS."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"  FM 34-8-2 F-7"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"FM 34-8-2 F-8 TVA, which is a detailed analysis of the enemy in selected COAs, uses the following enemy characteristics: Doctrine. Tactics. Equipment. Organizations. Expected behavior. TVA methodology provides a relative ranking of target sets, or categories. It begins when target analysts in the G2/S2 assume the position of enemy commander. The target analyst, in coordination with other staff members, wargames the operation. During wargaming, alternate friendly COAs are analyzed in terms of their impact on enemy operations and likely responses. The enemy battlefield functions that must be attacked to force the best enemy response are identified. The commander and staff analyze the criticality of friendly battlefield functions on a specific COA. The best places to attack HPTs are identified as TAIs. DPs or decision TPLs are used to ensure that the decision to engage or not to engage occurs at the proper time. Wargaming also identifies HVTs in priority that are critical to the success of the enemy mission. It also identifies the subset of HVTs which are HPTs that must be acquired and attacked for the friendly mission to succeed. HPTs selected are recorded on the DST. Collection managers evaluate HVTs to determine asset detection capability. HPTs receive priority in the allocation of assets. The FSO determines friendly weapons systems capable of attacking HVTs with lethal fires, and the EWO nominates and coordinates to provide non-lethal fires. Using the capabilities of the system to attack the targets, the G2/S2 analyzes and synthesizes the threat's response to each attack. Targets should be assigned priorities according to description, signature, degradation, and graphic representation. If targets have the same relative importance, a targeting team must prioritize the targets and seek advice from the FSE targeting analyst and the FAIO. After the targets are prioritized, they are placed on an HPTL (Figure F-5). After the HPTL is approved, the G2 will use it to develop the collection plan."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"  FM 34-8-2 F-9 EVENT OR PHASE: PRIORITY CATEGORY TARGET Figure F-5. Example high-payoff target list. TSS. TSS are criteria applied to enemy activity (acquisitions and battlefield information) used in deciding whether the activity is a target. TSS break nominations into two categories: targets, which meet accuracy and timeliness requirements for attack; and suspected targets, which must be confirmed before any attack. HPT. This refers to the designated HPTs which the collection manager is tasked to acquire. TIMELINESS. Valid targets are reported to attack systems within the designated timeliness criteria. ACCURACY. Valid targets must be reported to the attack system meeting the required TLE criteria. The criteria is the least restrictive TLE considering the capabilities of available attack systems. Considering these factors, different TSS may exist for a given enemy activity on the basis of different attack systems. For example, an enemy artillery battery may have a 150-meter TLE requirement for attack by cannon artillery and a 1 km requirement for attack helicopters. TSS are developed by the FSE in conjunction with MI personnel. Intelligence analysts use TSS to quickly determine targets from battlefield information and pass the targets to the FSE. Attack system managers, such as FSEs, FCEs, or FDCs, use TSS to quickly identify targets for attack. Commands can develop standard TSS based on anticipated enemy OB and doctrine matched with the normally available attack systems.

The TSS can be depicted in a TSS matrix (Figure F-6). The matrix lists each system that forwards targets directly to the FSE, FCE, or FDC. The effects of weather and terrain on the collection assets and on enemy equipment are considered. TSS are keyed to the situation.

Example target selection standards matrix. Attack Guidance. Knowing target vulnerabilities and the effect an attack will have on enemy operations allows a staff to propose the most efficient available attack option. Key guidance is whether the commander wishes to disrupt, delay, limit damage, or destroy the enemy. During wargaming, DPs linked to events, areas (NAIs and TAIs), or points on the battlefield are developed. These DPs cue the command decisions and staff actions where tactical decisions are needed. On the basis of commander's guidance, the targeting team recommends how each target should be engaged in terms of the effects of fire and attack options to use. Effects of fire (see Joint Pub 1-02) can be to harass, suppress, neutralize,"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"  FM 34-8-2 F-11 or destroy the target. The subjective nature of what is meant by these terms means the commander must ensure the targeting team understands his use of them. Applying FS automation system default values further complicates this understanding. Harassing fire is designed to disturb the rest of the enemy troops, to curtail movement, and, by threat of losses, to lower morale. The decision to employ harassing fires needs careful consideration. Harassing fire has little real effect on the enemy, subjects gun crews to an additional workload, and increases the threat of counter-battery fires. ROE or the potential for adverse public opinion may prohibit its use. However, harassing fires may be a combat multiplier in some situations. Consider their use in SASO , delaying actions, and economy of force operations. Suppressive fire on or about a weapons system degrades its performance below the level needed to fulfill its mission objectives. Suppression lasts only as long as the fires continue. The duration of suppressive fires is either specified in the call for fire or established by SOP. Suppression is used to prevent effective fire on friendly forces. It is typically used to support a specified movement of forces. The FSCOORD needs to ask or calculate the when and how long questions. Neutralization fire is delivered to render the target ineffective or unusable temporarily. Neutralization fire results in enemy personnel or material becoming incapable of interfering with an operation or COA. Key questions the FSCOORD must ask are when and how long does the commander want the target to be neutralized. Most planned missions are neutralization fires. Destruction fire is delivered for the sole purpose of destroying material objects. It physically renders the target permanently combat-ineffective unless it is restored, reconstituted, or rebuilt. Setting automated FS default values for destruction of 30 percent does not guarantee achieving the commander's intent. The surviving 70 percent may still influence the operation. Destruction missions are expensive in terms of time and material. Consider whether neutralization or suppression may be more efficient. The decision of what attack system to use is made at the same time as the decision on when to acquire and attack the target. Coordination is required when deciding to attack with two different means (such as EW and combat air operations).

Targeting officer and FSO. This process determines accurate, identifiable, and timely requirements for collection systems. The ACE must ensure collection system asset managers understand these requirements. Information needs for target detection are expressed as PIR and IR. Their priority depends on the importance of the target to the friendly COA and tracking requirements. PIR and IR that support detection of HPTs are incorporated into the overall unit collection plan. Targets are detected by the maximum use of all available assets. The G2/S2 must focus the intelligence acquisition efforts on the designated HPTs and PIR.

This information lets analysts develop the enemy situation and identify targets (Figure F-8). FS personnel provide the G2/S2 with the degree of located accuracy. The accuracy requirements are matched to the TLE of the collection systems. This allows the G2/S2 to develop more detailed TSS. NAIs and TAIs identified are matched with the most capable detection system available. If the target type and its associated signatures (e.g., electronic, visual, thermal) are known, the most capable collection asset can be directed against the target. The asset can be placed in the best position according to estimates of when and where the enemy target will be locate d. Assets are positioned based on friendly estimates of where the enemy target is located. Information needed to detect targets are expressed in PIR and IR, which are incorporated into the collection plan. The collection manager translates the PIR and IR into SIR. The collection manager considers the availability of all collection assets at all echelons. When a target is detected, the information is passed to the FAIO to determine if it is an HPT, its priority, and if it meets the TSS. To ensure that target information is passed quickly, the FAIO should be located in the ACE with communications to the FSE. Once an HPT is discovered, the FAIOs coordinate with their respective G2s/S2s and pass the targets directly to the FSE. If the commander approves the target, it is then passed to a firing unit.

Coordination between the intelligence staff and the FSE is essential to ensure that the targets are passed to an attack system that will engage the target. The FAIOs can coordinate with the G2 and FSE to pass HPTs and other targets directly to the FCE at the division artillery TOC or, if approved by the maneuver commander, directly to a firing unit.

Tracking priorities are based on the commanderâs concept of the operation and targeting priorities. Tracking is executed through the collection plan. Not all targets will be tracked. Because many critical targets move frequently or constantly, these HPTs require tracking. Synchronization of Intelligence Collection . While conducting operations, the G2/S2 monitors execution of the collection plan. He uses an ISM to synchronize the intelligence system in order to give answers to PIR in time to affect the decisions they support. As HPTs are identified, he informs the appropriate FSE and cross-cues collection assets to support BDA as needed. During delivery, NRT collectors and observers are cued to continue tracking targets during their engagement. Planned or cued BDA collection and reporting help determine if the engagement produced the desired effects. If not, continued tracking supports immediate reengagement. To facilitate hand-off of target and tracking responsibilities, the G2/S2 coordinates with higher and subordinate units. Requirements for intelligence in a given area can then be directed to the unit responsible for that area. Operational graphics are useful when tracking particular threat units or HPTs. Passing responsibility for the target as it crosses the graphic ensures that it is not lost in crossing. Synchronization continues during the CM process. The G2/S2 uses the products of the targeting process to develop SIR and SOR that synchronize the collection effort with command DPs. He plans and allocates time for collection, processing, and dissemination. During execution the collection manager monitors the collection and reporting to ensure synchronization. He prompts asset managers to meet timelines, cross-cueing, and retasking as necessary to keep intelligence operations synchronized with command operations. IEW Systems .

The degree of reliability and credibility of the assessment relies largely upon collection resources. The quantity and quality of collection assets influence whether the assessment is highly reliable (concrete, quantifiable, and precise) or has low reliability (best guess). The best BDAs use more than one collection discipline to verify each conclusion. Each BDA has three assessment components (Figure F-11). Each requires different sensors, analytical elements, and timelines. They are not necessaril y subcomp onents of each BDA report. (See FM 6-20-10, Appendix D.)

SASO CONSIDERATIONS Target development and targeting are difficult in an SASO environment. Although the principles of the targeting process still apply in SASO, consider the following: ROE tend to be more restrictive than in conventional combat situations. Everyone involved in the targeting process must completely understand the ROE. Identification of HVTs, threat intentions, threat locations, and weapons systems is slow to develop and may not be able to be acted upon when fully developed. Because of the nature of the threat (usually a relatively small, unconventional enemy may constitute a significant threat to US forces) determination of HVTs (specifically, what constitutes an HVT) is extremely difficult. Thus, it is difficult to develop precise time, location, and rates of march for a threat force. \"Targets,\" which blend into the population, are often less visible than conventional targets. When identified, targets present less of a window of opportunity in which to react, decreasing decision time. Because of considerations of the HN population, targeting must be precise. Selecting the right weapons system for the right target is paramount. Interaction and coordination with nontraditional elements and agencies may be required. This may include private organizations, NGOs, other federal agencies, civil agencies, allies or coalition forces, and HN forces.

INTERACTION OF BATTLEFIELD ENVIRONMENT ELEMENTS Weather conditions, terrain, BIC, illumination, and background signatures are some primary conditions found in a battlefield environment (Figure K-1). A weather element is an atmospheric variable that is measured in a weather observation. A weather parameter is derived from one or more weather elements. Example: Density altitude is a weather parameter derived from the element's barometric pressure and temperature. Weather conditions such as wind, precipitation, and clouds can impact or can be influenced by the other conditions of the battlefield. All of these conditions are interdependent, to a certain degree, and must be considered as a whole (Figure K-2). WEATHER EFFECTS AND TERRAIN Terrain features affect weather elements such as visibility, temperature, humidity, precipitation, winds, clouds. The most common example of terrain affecting weather is that on the windward side of high terrain, such as mountains, the rainfall rate will be greater than on the leeward (opposite) side. Weather conditions have a definite effect on the terrain and can enhance or limit military operations such as trafficability, water crossing (fording), and the first-round accuracy of supporting FA fires. The responsibility for determining mobility and counter-mobility is given to the terrain team at division."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"FM 34-8-2 K-2 ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE: Atmospheric pressure is the pressure exerted by the atmosphere at a given point and measured by a barometer in inches of mercury (Hg) or in millibars (Mb). Pressure Altitude: This is indicated in an altimeter when 29.92 is set in the barometric scale window. High pressure altitude is critical to the lift capability of fixed wing aircraft. Density Altitude: This is a place in the atmosphere corresponding to a particular value of air density. High pressure is critical to helicopter operations. CLOUDS: The amount of sky covered by clouds is usually described in eighths: Overcast (8/8ths), broken (5 to 7/8ths), or scattered (1 to 4/8ths). Cloud conditions are described by the amount of cloud cover and the height of the base of the cloud AGL. A cloud ceiling is the height of the lowest broken or overcast layer, and is expressed in feet. A higher layer of several scattered layers of clouds is designated as a cloud ceiling when the sum of the coverage of the lower layers exceeds 4/8ths.    DEW POINT TEMPERATURE: Dew point is the temperature to which the air must be cooled for the air to become saturated and allow dew, and probably fog, to form. HUMIDITY: This is the state of the atmosphere with respect to water vapor content. It is usually expressed as: Relative Humidity: The ratio between the air's water content and the water content of saturated air. Absolute Humidity: The measure of the total water content in the air. It is high in the tropical ocean areas and low in the arctic. PRECIPITATION: Precipitation is any moisture falling from a cloud in frozen or liquid form. Rain, snow, hail, drizzle, sleet, and freezing rain are common types. The intensity of precipitation is described as light, moderate, and heavy. Light Rain: Drops are easily seen, very little spray, and puddles form slowly, and accumulation is a trace to 0.10 in/h. Figure K-1. Common weather elements."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"FM 34-8-2 K-3 Moderate Rain: Drops are not easily seen, spray noticeable, puddles form rapidly, and accumulation rates are 0.11 to 0.30 in/h. Heavy Rain: Drops are not seen, rain comes in sheets with heavy spray, puddles form quickly, and the rate is more than 0.30 in/h. Light Snow: Visibility is equal to or greater than 5/8 miles, or 1,000 meters in falling snow; and a trace to 1 in/hr accumulates. Moderate Snow: Visibility is 5/16 to Â½ statute miles, or 500 through 900 meters in falling snow with 1 to 3 in/hr accumulation. Heavy Snow: In heavy snow, visibility is cut to less than 1/4 statute miles, or 400 meters, with more than accumulation of 3 in/h. TEMPERATURE: Temperature is the value of heat or cold recorded by a thermometer normally at 6 feet AGL at the observation site. Temperatures are normally given in both Fahrenheit and Celsius values. It is sometimes referred to as the ambient air temperature.     VISIBILITY: A measurement of the horizontal distance at the surface or aloft that the unaided human eye can discern a large object or terrain feature. Visibility is reported in meters or fractions of a mile, and is reported as a prevailing value of the visibility in all directions. Thus, a visibility report of 1,600 meters may not reveal that fog is diminishing visibility to 400 meters in the northwest if the observer has good visibility in other directions. However, such an event would typically be carried in the weather observation's remarks section. WIND SPEED AND DIRECTION: These two measure the rate of movement of the air past a given point and the direction from which the wind is blowing. A gust is a rapid fluctuation in wind speed with a variation of 10 knots or more between peak and lull. Gust spread is the instantaneous difference between a peak and a lull and is important for helicopter operations. Figure K-1.

BATTLEFIELD-INDUCED CONTAMINANTS During combat operations, visibility can become severely reduced by BIC. These contaminants are either induced directly by combatants or occur as by-products from battlefield operations. Two significant sources of battlefield contaminants are dust produced by HE artillery or mortar rounds and deliberately employed smoke. HE rounds used in a pre-attack barrage not only may kill enemy forces but also may restrict the visibility of your own troops by dust caused by the HE if you do not consider the direction of the wind. Smoke produced by smoke generators, vehicle exhaust emission"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"FM 34-8-2 K-5 systems, smoke pots, indirect fire, and smoke rounds also produce battlefield contaminants. Wind speed and direction are critical to maintaining an effective smoke screen. Rain can remove BIC quickly. Weather inversions over valley areas can sustain airborne contaminants for long periods. Other sources of BIC that will lower visibility in the AO are clouds of dust from vehicle traffic or smoke from fires. These types of contaminants not only blind you but also may help your adversary in detecting troop movements and pinpointing your location. A unique BIC affecting visibility occurs in conditions when temperatures are in the range of -30 E C or -22 E F or colder. When a source of moisture or water vapor is released into the cold air by internal combustion engines, artillery fires, or launched self-propelled munitions, visibility can be reduced to zero when the moisture freezes instantly and changes into ice fog. Ice fog may restrict visibility across a whole valley and can linger for hours. Ice fog crystals permit ground objects to be seen from above while severely restricting visibility on the groundâan advantage for aerial reconnaissance. On airfields an ice fog created by fixed-wing aircraft may cover an entire runway. Visibility can be reduced so that other aircraft cannot take off or land if the wind is calm. The ice fog also draws attention to the airfield location. Launching missiles such as the TOW in very cold air can create an ice fog. As the TOW moves to the target, the exhaust blast exits into the air where it condenses and creates the ice fog. If the wind is calm, this fog follows the trajectory of the missile and reduces launch point visibility to such an extent that the operator loses sight of the target. Also, the launch point can be identified by threat forces from the condensation trail of the missile. ILLUMINATION Natural light is critical in planning operations where NVD are used or in operations timed to use only available light. Natural light values vary as a function of the position of the sun, moon, stars, and clouds. Light data are available from your SWO for any time period and place. These data are particularly important for determining first and last light, moonrise, and moonset, and are most effective for planning use of NVD."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"FM 34-8-2 K-6 Variables such as altitude, cloud cover, terrain-produced shadows, visibility, and direction of vehicle or aircraft movement in relation to the sun or the moon can also affect light level availability. Artificial light is intended to increase visibility but, under certain weather conditions, this does not always occur. Example: Low cloud ceilings will limit the area covered and effective time of flares. Rain, snow, or fog can reduce flare effectiveness. However, under the right conditions, cloud cover can enhance the effects of artificial light due to cloud base reflection. Snow- or sand-covered terrain also reflect both natural and artificial light. BACKGROUND SIGNATURES Temperature, wind, and precipitation have a major influence on your ability to pick out a target from the background in the infrared spectrum. They also affect seismic (sound and acoustic) signatures. Detection of objects in the infrared spectrum depends on a temperature contrast between the object and its surrounding environment. This difference is known as the background signature. Snow, rain, and wind influence the background signature because they can change the surface temperature of objects. These elements lower object temperatures and thus reduce the differential between a target and its background. A heavy layer of snow produces a washout during any part of the day since it causes both the object and the background to exhibit the same temperature. Precipitation also degrades seismic sensors through the introduction of background noise (rain), while a snow-covered surface will dampen sound and the movement of troops. SEVERE OR HAZARDOUS WEATHER In addition to a continuous need for forecast updates, you need non-forecasted or unanticipated severe or hazardous weather warnings. WETMs normally issue severe weather warnings and advisories. Check for the values at which each weather element becomes known as severe. You will be concerned with conditions such asâ"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"FM 34-8-2 K-7 Tornadoes. Thunderstorms producing winds in excess of 45 knots and hail greater than 3/4 of an inch. Hurricanes and typhoons. Precipitation (rain or snow) when X inches fall in Y hours. Surface winds in excess of X knots. Maximum and minimum temperatures; when a forecast value misses the actual temperature by X degrees. You want to know that an earlier forecast for light snow was amended to a forecast of a 16-inch accumulation within the next 12 hours. We cannot over emphasize that you need to work with your next higher HQ S2/G2 and the SWO so that your needs are realistically stated and can be supported. All of your weather support needs should be reviewed every 6 months in garrison and as required in the field. LIGHT DATA Another weather-related element that your commander needs is light data. NVD and NVG have made many night operations feasible. Your SWO provides official times for sunrise and sunset, BMCT and EECT, BMNT and EENT, length of absolute darkness, moonrise, moonset, lunar phase in percent, and time periods for using NVD and NVG. Light data to support NVD is needed because there are times when there is not enough moon or starlight to use them. Civil twilight is sufficient for conduct of combat operations while nautical twilight permits most ground movements without difficulty. Nautical twilight allows a general visibility of up to 400 meters (1,320 ft) and lets you distinguish silhouettes from the background. The actual duration of light varies with latitude and time of year. For example, in the vicinity of 35 to 40 degrees north latitude, civil twilight generally occurs 30 to 45 minutes before sunrise and after sunset. In the tropics, twilight is shorter. Once light requirements are determined, relay them to your next higher S2 and SWO. This information is important for your commander because he needs to know not only when he can begin friendly military operations (day or night) but also when threat operations could begin."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"FM 34-8-2 K-8 OTHER CONSIDERATIONS Although HF radio wave propagation forecasts are not normally available to the SWO, he can make arrangements before he deploys to receive these forecasts. When available, they should be given to every signal and intelligence organization. The SIGO should know that when HF is not effective, it may be because of solar activity rather than enemy jamming. The USAF Global Weather Central can routinely provide solar forecast products to the SWO even in the field. Other data, such as tidal information and sea state conditions, can be obtained from the SWO but are normally provided only to specific Army units upon request. RECEIPT OF FORECASTS Every tactical echelon should receive the weather forecast prepared and briefed to the commander at the next higher echelon. With no SWO at a maneuver brigade, you receive both the forecast briefed at division covering the division AO and the forecast made by the division SWO specifically for your brigade. Each forecast message received should be worked by you to discover the direct weather impacts on your unit. A commander wants the weather forecast. He also needs the effects and impacts of the forecasted weather interpreted for his specific operations, systems, and personnel. Schedule your forecasts so they arrive in time for you to prepare your commander's briefing. HOW G2 OR S2 RECEIVE WEATHER SUPPORT It is your responsibility to provide weather and weather effects information to your commander and supported or subordinate units. Methods may vary among units and echelons. At higher echelons, the SWO has primary responsibility for providing weather support. There, the G2 simply contacts the SWO, states requirements, and receives the needed weather support. If you have no SWO, you must pass the request up the chain of command to a level where one is assigned. Once your requirements have been validated, weather support products flow back over the same path. In addition to weather forecast products, the SWO can provide specialized weather effects products. You must provide the threshold values used in developing these products."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"FM 34-8-2 K-9 You alert your commander and staff about the adverse impact of the forecasted weather. You prepare two simple charts to use during your commander's stand-up briefing. You can post these charts in the CP for reference. Update the charts when a new forecast is issued by the WETM. Methods used in briefing your commander during the morning and evening briefings may vary greatly among commands. The formats below are a guide and should be modified to suit your situation.

WEATHER AND ENVIRONMENTAL ELEMENTS AND PARAMETERS IMPACTING ARMY SYSTEMS AND OPERATIONS:"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"FM 34-8-2 K-18 Table K-4 is compiled from a study conducted by the US Army Intelligence School as part of the IEWMAA. Each TRADOC branch was asked to survey the impact of weather and environmental elements on their operations, systems, and personnel and rate them as either essential (E) or desired (D) . Also included are other Army agencies' requirements. E âSome positive action had to be taken by the user based on severe current or forecasted weather conditions.

Primary concerns are physical exhaustion and dehydration. You must consider both because a common work task will take longer and additional water may have to be transported during hot weather. The following are specific concerns: Water Adequacy . Water supplies and the enforcement of its intake before, during, and after physical activity is critical for survival. Workload Correlation. Adapt workload or training activities to environmental heat stress conditions. Rest Periods. Provide adequate break time for physically active personnel in a hot environment. Chilled Drinking Water. Soldiers will often reject warm drinking water even when they are significantly dehydrated. Physical Activity. Soldiers' introduction to physical exertion in a hot climate upon arriving from a temperate climate should be as gradual as circumstances allow. They will need 1 to 2 weeks' time to physiologically adjust to the new climate. Lighten physical activity during this period to ensure optimum performance. Salt. Sodium intake must be maintained in hot weather. Two good meals a day normally provide enough salt for most soldiers. Humidity. A low WBGT index (e.g., in the morning) may not be a totally safe indicator if the humidity is high. High humidity retards cooling by evaporation of sweat and decreases the urge to drink sufficient water. Water Spray. A water mist will cool a person. But it should never be substituted for adequate consumption of water before, during, and after strenuous activities in the heat.
