It turned out great. Basically, I just halved your recipe and added a few things. My DAK is a 3 cup flour model, is yours? If I'm using whole wheat or rye flour, I can add more flour because it doesn't rise as much. Also, whenever I use whole wheat, etc. I add vital wheat gluten and lecithin to aid elasticity and to help it rise. This is what I put in the DAK and the order I used: Turn the light/dark setting to 12 o'clock and set the menu to Sweet Bread (the auto. one, not the manual one) Later, at the beeps, I added 3/4 c. pecans (didn't have walnuts on hand). I usually add large pieces since they are kind of cut up by the B/M while knead ing. We can keep experimenting with this....let me know if you try it and what you add or subtract. Have you ever added raisins, oatmeal or any kind of seeds? The B/M gives me the lazy way out, and I wanted to see what it would do in it. Thanks so much for taking precious time to post the recipe. P.S. I have some of the beer s/d starter to give you when we get together, but the whole wheat starter is GREAT!. Regards, 08/21 11:14 P.M.

On a trip to New England I bought bread in a town square, it was wonderful! Later I wrote the baker for the recipe and she kindly sent it. I've only tried it once (I'm new to bread making). But now I'd like to try it in my BM. (the directions follow for assembling ingredients, etc. but since I want to make it in my BM, I'm not including them. Divide dough in two. Divide each half into 3 and make 3 ropes. Braid them and make into a circle. Attach both ends,repeat with other half. The bread was delicious and I would appreciate any help someone can give me.

It will become bubbly and foamy. Watch for its 'peak'. This usually occurs 8 to 10 hours after feeding. It is best to keep the starter warm (75 to 85 degrees). If it cold out, leave it in the oven with the light turned on! * Make your bread during the peak...while the starter is VERY active. * Dump the unused starter back into the mother pot. Following this method, you can even make sourdough in the b/m without yeast. Really! *Variation: Separate your starter into two batches. Create a \"beer\" starter with one batch. You will feed this pot with flat beer and flour instead of water and flour. A very unique and delicious taste! * To create your own sourdough recipe: Substitute 7/8 cup start for 1 cup liquid Reduce flour by 1/4 to 1/2 cup ----- ---------- Recipe via Meal-Master (tm) v7.05 Title: FLOUR MEASURING HINT Categories: Information, Breadmaker, Breads Servings: 1 Diana Lewis vgwn37a All flour is presifted but it settles during shipment.

What is a Sourdough Starter? \"A sourdough starter is a wild yeast living in a batter of flour and liquid. Yeasts are microscopic fungi related distantly to mushrooms. There are many varieties of these tiny organisms around us everywhere. Wild yeasts are rugged individualists which can withstand the most extreme of circumstances. Some will make delicious loaves of bread; others will create yogurt and cheese out of milk; still others will turn the juices of grains and fruit into beer and wine.\" \"Active dry yeast, the kind we can buy in packets at our grocer's, is a domesticated descendant of these wild relatives, one which has been grown for flavor, speed of growth and predictability. But domestic yeasts are much more fragile and can't be grown at home without eventually reverting to their original wild state.\" \"If you can imagine a world without any packets of active dry yeast, you can imagine how important your sourdough starter would be to you. Without it, you would be doomed to some pretty awful eating. It is no wonder that sourdough starters were treasured, fought over, and carried to all ends of the earth. To the early prospectors, it was such a valued possession (almost more than the gold they were seeking), that they slept with it on frigid winter nights to keep it from freezing. (Ironically, freezing won't kill a sourdough starter although too much heat will.)\" Fermentation (or the Microscopic Magic of Yeast): \"As we mentioned above, yeast is a microscopic fungus. As it feeds on the natural sugars in grain, it multiplies and gives off carbon dioxide (just as we do when we breathe). This invisible activity of yeast is called fermentation. When you make"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":" bread with wheat, by kneading the long elastic strands of wheat protein (called gluten) into an elastic mesh, you create traps for these carbon dioxide bubbles causing the dough to expand as if it contained a million tiny balloons.\" ----- ---------- Recipe via Meal-Master (tm) v7.05 Title: KING ARTHUR FLOUR - SOURDOUGH STARTER TIPS 2 Categories: Information, Breads Servings: 1 -DEBBIE CARLSON (PHHW01A) -KING ARTHUR FLOUR HINTS (Continued) How to Feed & Care for Your Sourdough Starter: \"Keeping a sourdough starter is somewhat like having a pet because it needs to be fed and cared for. But its requirements are simple and not time consuming. Baking with sourdough is also a simple process. All it takes is a little planning and timing. The results are so satisfying, you'll grow to treasure your invisible pet the way our ancestors did.\" \"When you receive your starter, refrigerate it if you don't intend to feed it immediately (at any rate, starter should be fed as soon as possible after you receive it). To feed it for the first time, snip off a corner of the plastic bag and squeeze the starter into a glass or ceramic bowl (not metal). Stir in 3 cups of lukewarm water (what feels comfortable on your wrist) and 3 cups of unbleached all-purpose flour. Mix until it's well blended and the consistency of pancake batter. Let the replenished starter sit at room temperature for at least 12 hours to give the yeast a chance to multiply and become active before you put it in the refrigerator. Ordinarily you would feed your starter when you remove some to bake with it. A good rule of thumb is to replenish it every two weeks or so, preferably because you made a wonderful loaf of sourdough bread, a stack of pancakes or a delicious sourdough cake.\" (This previous paragraph is for those people who have ordered King Arthur's Sourdough Starter from their catalog.) \"During the time the starter is stored in the refrigerator, it becomes relatively dormant which is why it can survive so long with so little attention. You'll find that a clear, amber colored liquid will accumulate on the surface of the starter. This liquid contains 12% to 14% alcohol.\" \"When yeast is in contact with air, it produces carbon dioxide; when it's not, it produces alcohol. When you blend the alcohol back into the starter, it helps produce the unique flavor you find in good sourdough breads. For milder flavor, you can pour off some of the alcohol if you wish although this will thicken the starter requiring a bit more liquid to return it to its \"pancake batter\" consistency. (To \"sweeten\" a starter in another way, see Troubleshooting which follows.)

You may want to transfer it to a plastic container first as it will expand as it freezes. When you are ready to use it again, give it a day to revive, feed it a good meal, give it another day to build up an armada of fresh, new wild siblings and it will be ready to go to work.\" \"Drying: An alternative storage method is to dry your starter by spreading it out on a piece of heavy plastic wrap or waxed paper. Once it's dry, crumble it up and put it in an airtight container. Store it some place cool, or, to be safe, in the freezer. To reactivate the dried starter, grind it into small particles with a hand cranked grinder, a blender or a food processor. Pour 1 to 1 1/2 cups of warm water (what feels comfortable on your wrist) into a glass or ceramic bowl. Stir in and dissolve a tablespoon of sugar or honey. This isn't necessary but it gives the yeast an easy \"first course.\" Blend in an equal amount of flour and dried starter. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and watch for small telltale bubbles which should begin to appear on the surface within a few hours. Once you see them you'll know it's alive and well. Let it continue to feed and grow for a further 12 hours before you cover and refrigerate it.\" How to Remove Some Starter for Baking: \"With a spoon or wire whisk, blend the liquid back into the starter and then measure out the quantity required by your recipe.

(Or instead of discarding the starter you removed, ask a neighbor if he or she would be interested in adopting a starter of his/her very own.) Let the resuscitated mixture sit at room temperature for 12 hours or so before you return it to the refrigerator.\" Treating a \"Sluggish\" Starter: \"If you feel that your starter is just not \"up to snuff,\" dissolve a teaspoon of yeast in the cup of water you mix into the starter when you feed it. (If you live in an area where water is chlorinated, let some sit out overnight to allow the chlorine to dissipate to preclude any interference with the development of the sourdough micro-organisms).\" Sweetening a Starter: \"If your starter becomes too sour, take out 1 cup, dispose of the remainder, and add 2 cups of each of flour and water to refreshen it.\" Increasing Your Starter: \"If you want to grow a large amount of starter to give some to a friend or to do a lot of baking, simply increase the amount you feed it.\" Resuscitating a Neglected Starter: \"If your sourdough starter has sat in the refrigerator months beyond the point of health, give it a fighting chance for survival before you throw it out. A little warmth and a good meal of strong, high energy carbohydrates may be all it needs to get it off and running again.\" \"The layer of liquid on the surface will probably be very dark, making it look as if the starter must surely have expired.

Gluten is an element of the wheat berry that contains two special proteins, gluten in and gliadin. When you are making bread, and you add liquid to the flour, you get these two proteins in business. They start to interact and form a web which traps the carbon dioxide that the yeast is giving off. This web is developed during the kneading process. Wheat is the only grain which contains gluten.\" \"To use gluten, we have found that adding a tablespoon for each cup of flour called for in the recipe will increase the rise in the bread from 25% to 30%. The proper way to measure the gluten is to put 1 tablespoon of the gluten in your measuring cup and then spoon the flour into the cup on top of the gluten.

Yeast Proofing: To \"proof\" yeast, first dissolve the sugar (about 1 Tbsp. for each 2 cups liquid) or other sweetener in warm water (about 95 degrees) and then add your yeast. Wait several minutes for it to dissolve and begin to \"work\", or develop tiny bubbles. If it doesn't show signs of life, discard it and try another batch. Because yeast doesn't like salt, add it after the yeast is \"proofed\". 2. A Better Measure: Because flour settles and compacts in storage, fluff it up before you measure. Then,"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":" gently sprinkle it into your measuring cup and scrape the excess off with the back of a knife. This will insure a 4 oz. cup of flour rather than the 5 oz. you would have if you scooped it out with your cup. 3. Rest When You \"Knead\" It!: After 3 or 4 minutes of kneading dough, let it rest for a few minutes. The rest relaxes the dough and makes the remaining kneading easier. 4. Liquid Assets: Instead of the water your recipe calls for, try juices, bouillon, or water you've cooked vegetables in. Instead of milk, try buttermilk, yogurt, or sour cream. It can add a whole new flavor and improve nutrition. 5. Sweeteners: Even though you don't need it when making bread, a little sugar can bring out flavor, just as salt can. For added moisture, try honey, maple syrup, or regular or dark unsulphured molasses. 6. Oil for Longevity: If you don't mind a few extra calories (12 to 15) per slice (a slice of bread without fat has only 60 to 65 calories!), add a couple of tablespoons of butter or vegetable oil to your dough, and your bread will stay fresher for a longer period. 7. Storing King Arthur Flour: If you use your flour fairly quickly, store it in a cool, dry cupboard and stick a couple of bay leaves in the bag to discourage any visitors. If you use your flour more slowly, especially your whole wheat, put it in a lock-type plastic bag and store it in your freezer. 06/30 09:22 pm LORELI Loafing and Laughing in Ocala,L FOOD AND WINE BB TOPIC: BREADS BY MACHINE TIME: 06/30 9:24 PM TO: LORELI AGUDA (WSKD49A) FROM: LORELI AGUDA (WSKD49A) SUBJECT: \"MEGA 500+\" FOR JUDY ----- ---------- Recipe via Meal-Master (tm) v7.05 Title: OAT-WHEAT BAGEL BREAD Categories: Breadmaker, Breads Servings: 1 1 1/2 ts Yeast - 1  1 1/2 ts Cinnamon 1 1 1/2 ts Gluten - 1  1 ts Salt - 1 1/2 1 1/2 c Oat flour 1 3 tb Honey - 2 1 1/2 c Whole wheat flour - 1 1 c Water - 5 1/2 oz 1437 cal - 1030 - Amounts are for 1 1/2 pound loaves - amounts to the right"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":" are for 1 pound loaves.

Stir in flour and yeast. Leave uncovered in a warm place for 2-5 days, depending on how long it takes it to bubble and sour. If it starts to dry out, stir in enough tepid water to bring it back to the original consistency. Once it has a good sour aroma and is full of bubbles, it is ready to use. Try to maintain about 1 and 1/2 cups of starter. Each time part of the starter is used, replenish with a mixture of equal parts milk and flour. Leave at room temperature several hours or overnight, or until it begins to fill with bubbles. Then cover and store in refrigerator. Starter is best if used at least once a week. If starter isn't, used for 2 or 3 weeks, spoon out and discard about half and replenish as described. Given attention, a starter becomes more flavorful with age. Starter can be frozen if it is not to be used for several weeks. This will slow down yeast action and should be left at room temperature for 24 hours after thawing.

Combine flour, salt, yeast and water in bowl. Blend well, turn out onto floured surface. Knead well, about 15 minutes. Place in lightly greased bowl, not buttered, cover with a damp cloth and let rise for 1-1/2 hours (until doubled in bulk). Turn dough out, punch down and knead for 5 minutes or so. Return to bowl and let rise until doubled in bulk. Punch down and turn out on lightly floured board. Roll and press out to about 1/2 inch thickness. This recipe makes about 1-12 inchers-so you can judge whether to double or reduce the recipe. Rub surface of baking (cookie) sheet with oil and transfer the dough round to the sheet. Make several indentations with the point of a knife in the dough and insert garlic slices and rosemary into indentations.Rub olive oil (pour) onto surface and gently smooth over the surface. Salt and pepper surface LIGHTLY. Bake 10-12 minutes or until just golden. Remove from oven and TAKE OUT THE GARLIC SLIVERS!

Let it cool to lukewarm while softening yeast in a small bowl with the warm water. When soft, add the egg and beat together slightly. Pour the yeast/egg mixture into the milk mixture and stir them together. The flour may be sifted or poured into the liquid. With a large spoon, stir until flour/milk is well mixed. You should have a firm, but not stiff dough. Without removing it from the bowl, cover the dough with a plate or towel and set aside to rise until double in bulk (about 2 hrs depending on the temperature in the kitchen). Instead of letting the dough rise at this point you may put it in the refrigerator and use it later, or the next day. Watch to make sure it doesn't spill out of the bowl. If it starts to spill before you're ready to use it, punch it back down. Refrigerated dough is easier to handle but takes longer to rise. BREAD: If you want to make bread, dump the dough out of the bowl onto a floured surface and with more flour as needed to keep it from sticking, knead it until springy and easy to handle. This dough does not require a lot of kneading; only enough to make it easy to handle. For 2 medium size loaves cut the dough in half and knead/shape each into loaves and put into greased baking pans. Allow about 2 hours for the dough to double again. Bake in a 375 degree oven until lightly browned on top (if uncertain whether or not bread is done, tip out of pan and see if bottom is browned too). ROLLS: To make rolls, work and knead dough until springy and easily handled. Roll out with a rolling pin and cut with a biscuit cutter and fold over and place on a greased cookie sheet (Parkerhouse rolls), or break dough into small pieces, make into little balls and place 3 in each section of a greased muffin pan (Cloverleaf rolls). SWEET ROLLS: For Christmas bread or sweet rolls, roll out dough as for Parkerhouse rolls, except trying to make an oblong instead of a round. Spread it with raisins and sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar. Dot with butter and roll as for a jelly roll. Slice and place on a greased pan or make into a circle and make slashes through the dough at intervals. Let rise and bake as for loaves. Top with an icing made of confectioners' sugar, melted butter, milk, and vanilla or rum flavoring and drizzle over the bread or rolls while hot. Decorate with nuts or fruits. If you want to make a whole wheat bread, use half white and half whole wheat flour, and use brown sugar instead of white.

This recipe is adapted from the nutrition dept. of the Univ. of Washington School of Medicine. Combine flour, sugar, xanthan gum, milk powder, and salt in bowl of heavy duty mixer. Use your strongest beaters. Dissolve the 2 teaspoons of sugar in the 1/2 cup of lukewarm water and mix in the yeast. Set aside while you combine the shortening and 1 1/4 cups water in saucepan and heat until shortening melts. Turn mixer on low. Blend dry ingredients and slowly add shortening and water mixture and the vinegar. Blend, then add the eggs. This mixture should feel slightly warm. Pour the yeast mixture into the ingredients in the bowl and beat at highest speed for 2 minutes. "},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":" Place mixing bowl in a warm place, cover with plastic wrap and a towel, and let the dough rise approximately 1 to 1 1/2 hours or until doubled. Return to mixer and beat on high for 3 minutes. Spoon the dough into 3 small (2 1/2\" x 5\") greased loaf pans or 1 large one. Use muffin tins and bake any remaining as small rolls. Or make all rolls (approximately 18). Let rise until the dough is slightly above the top of pan. Bake in preheated 400 degree oven for 10 minutes. Place foil over bread and bake large loaves 50 minutes longer, small loaves slightly less time, and rolls about 25 minutes. NOTES: The dough texture will seem more like cookie dough than bread dough, so don't be alarmed. Bread is better when baked in small loaf pans and delicious in rolls. I have successfully doubled the recipe to turn out 2 large loaves plus 18 rolls in the muffin tins or 3 small 2 1/2\" x 5\" loaves plus 24 rolls. This bread freezes well. For convenience, slice before freezing. This bread may be made with either brown or white rice flour in the GF flour mix. GF flour mix: 2 parts white rice flour 2/3 part potato starch flour 1/3 part tapioca flour Source: The Gluten-Free Gourmet by Bette Hagman NOTE: The book says xanthan gum is necessary for all yeast recipes to help make the breads springy and chewy. It helps to replace the gluten the rice and potato flours lack.

Turn out onto floured surface and kneed for about 10 minutes, adding extra flour if too moist. Kneed until dough is smooth and elastic. Cover with towel and rest for 30 minutes. Cut into 4 portions, keep pieces covered until used. Get out your machine and set dial on widest setting (1 on the Atlas). Flatten dough ball and run through rollers several times until smooth (you may add a bit of flour here too). Move rollers to next setting and roll again once. Continue to roll until pasta is the proper thickness (5 or 6 on the Atlas). You may cut sheet in half if it's too long. Continue with other pieces and then put the finished sheet aside to dry for about 3 minutes. Attach desired pasta cutters and run the sheets through. You can use right away or spread out the pasta to dry overnight and then freeze extra. To cook, drop into large pot of boiling water with a bit of salt and oil. Cook until al dente, which should only take about 2 minutes for fresh. A tip - be sure the dough is fairly dry, otherwise it won't cut into separate strands. Another tip - You can substitute heavy cream for the 1/3 c water for a richer pasta.

When ready to serve frozen hush puppies, place on oven rack in preheated 250\"F until very hot and crisp. Makes about 48 hush puppies 2\" round. Hints on frying: Using a small diameter heavy saucepan allows using a minimum oil; a 5 or 6 inch pan with oil 1 1/2 inches deep and heated to 350\"F will cook three hush puppies in about 2 1/2 minutes. When batter consistency is correct and oil is at 350\"F, hush puppies will become firm, round shapes almost as soon as they enter the hot oil. If they are cooked in oil that is too hot, they will not cook in the center. Serving suggestions: Especially good served with fried catfish, trout, shrimp, oysters, chicken or chicken-fried steak.
