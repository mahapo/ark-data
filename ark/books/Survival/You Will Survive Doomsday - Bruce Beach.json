DOOMSDAY MYTH #01: Almost everyone will suddenly be killed on doomsday. You will survive doomsday. And here yo u thought that if it ever happened the bomb would fall right on you. Probably not. It wi ll more likely go like this. One day, the inferior Ru ssian computers may make a mistake and decide that the US has already launched a pre-emptory attack against Russia. The US warning system ha s made that same sort of mistake many times and a number of times we have gotten just minutes away from launching our retaliation before the mistake was discovered. Who is to say the Russians will always be so smart?

Before this occurs the US has just minutes within which to respond or it will be caught with its missiles down. The hotline to Russia happens to be no t working (this has also happened a number of times before). That is one of the factors that entered into the Russians decision to launch. So, what's his name in the White House reaches for a jellybean and pushes the button. In terception missiles of cour se try to stop the Russian missiles before they reach their first two primary targets, NORAD (NORthern Air Defense) he adquarters in Colorado Springs, Colorado and its backup at North Bay, Ontario. These are hardened unde rground computer and co mmunication sites that may require several bombs to wipe them out. Given the number of missiles that may be inte rcepted the Russians have sent a handful. A better way to wipe out the communications of No rth America is to just explode four thermonuclear devices at a high altitude over the continent. These will generate an EMP (Electro Magnetic Pulse) that will knock out most electric and el ectronic devices tied into th e power grids. It will also knock out any new devices that contain IC's (integ rated circuits) and that have an antenna over thir ty inches long. That mean s that your car radio, portable radio, and television will be inoperable, even if the power ever does come back on. All over the continent the power and li ghts will suddenly go off. If you happen to be listenin g to a battery operated old tube type radio (when did you last see one of thos e?) that is tuned into a \"hardened\" transmitter sight (I don't know where you will find one) that transmits (fat chance) the EBS (Emergency Broadc ast Signal) then you will know that doomsday has begun. Otherwise you will be standing out th ere with the rest of us survivors saying, \"Nice day, eh? St range the power would go off on a nice day like this.\" Silence. The sun w ill continue to shine, an d the birds will sing, and the breezes will blow and you will still not know that they have a bit of a problem up in North Bay. They ar e no longer there. Silence.

You th ought you had seen rapid inflation before but this is like from zero to a million in sixty seconds. At the supermarket, if you are early enough, you will find pandemonium. If not, you will find pr actically nothing. Maybe a large bag of dog food (take it) and some cans of floor wax (f orget it). The rest of the stuff was all in those carts that you met come flying up the walk as you came running down. There won't be any girls at the cash registers, (they have done their shopping and gone). Besides, the ca sh registers aren't working anyhow, with no power. It may have taken the hired mana ger a little longer to figure out that he should grab what he can and head home to his family, but he has probably gone now. The on ly cops you will see are the one's grabbing stuff themselves. If on the way back you sp ot a shopping basket with something in it - think twice before helping yourse lf. If there is an alterc ation there are probably no doctors at the hospital to sew up the lacerations. Everyone else is also too busy to bother calling an ambulance, if they could, and one wouldn't be available if they did. Of course the trip to th e supermarket may have been nothing like that at all. It may have just been a bit more active than usual but if most people haven't caught on yet then we are ve ry lucky.

The primary targets are now most like submarine bases, to prevent more subs from leaving port). Then they will start on the secondar y targets. All the SAC (Strategic Air Command) bases both in the US and around the rest of the world. Oh, they have lots to keep them busy for a while. Citi es themselves are pretty far down the list. Maybe they won't even go for them. Any airport with over a ten thousand foot runway is pretty important ho wever because the SAC could land and refuel their bomber there. So you know where that puts us. They will probably get around to us in the next day or two. There are two strategies of warfare. On e is called counterforce and the other is called countervalue . With counterforce yo u knockout the enemy's forces so he can't harm you. This can be very chivalrous like the fighting codes of the knights of old. You never harm th e women and children. On the other hand, with countervalue , you go after everything the enemy holds dear in order to demoralize him. This wa s the technique of the Mongolian hordes. \"Take no prisoners.\" \"Eliminate the en emy.\" \"The only good Indian is a dead Indian.\" \"Eliminate the Je ws.\" \"Sock it to the Japs.\" Women, children, babi es, everybody goes. Now the problem with countervalue wa rfare is if everybody knows they are either going to win or die, some people can ge t very tough. So maybe the best thing is to knockout the mili tary forces and ho ld the cities as hostage. \"Now, either surrender or we bomb the cities.\" Anyway, the cities aren't generall y the first targets. And so here we sit. Un scratched, the day after doomsday. But we can see some problems on the ho rizon. Very possibly th e city is going to be bombed in the next day or two.

A world without el ectricity, automobiles, radio, television, telephones, and supermarkets. And maybe eventually with only twenty million people in North Americ a. (They won't all be Canadians).

Nothing, of course, would protect you if there were a direct hit on yo ur shelter, but a good bomb shelter could certainly g ive you very g ood protection as little as five miles from ground zero. The trouble is that subways and under g round g ara g es are not desi g ned as blast shelters. They do no t have blast vents and d oors. Anyone in such a place, at the time of blas t, within a couple of mile s of ground zero will be subjected to a ph enomenon called popcorning . Minute particles of greatly accelerated sand will caus e blisters to pop out al l over exposed parts of the body. This, combined wi th several other patholo g ical mechanisms, will probably result in a rather pa inful death within a few days. Although the blast protection in an underground shelter is much superior to being above ground there are reason s that one is better off staying in their high-rise apartment rather than going to a large public shelter if they feel there is little or no danger of blast. The public shelters ha ve no supplies and no equipment. The average designated public shelter is suppose d to shelter over three thousand people. Can you imagine the anarchy and conditions there? Without food, the first to die will be infants who are not being breast fed. Other early candidates will be persons who requ ire special medications (especially the elderly) and anyone who happens to be injured. Not only will deaths have negative ps ychological effects on the survivors, they will create severe sanitation problems. There will be enough sanitation problems an yway if the water and sewage systems are not working. Most of the designated shel ter locations do no t have sanitary provision for three th ousand people in the first place. One of the greatest haza rds in an underground shelter is carbon dioxide poisoning. The designated public shelters, almost without exception, do not have adequate ventilation for large numbers of people over a considerable period of time. And the existing ventilation systems generally depend upon elec tricity being available. There are ventilation defense and surviv al techniques available. However, if you were to try to implement them in a large public shelter situation you would probably be one of the first persons kille d by the other survivors. The reason is that most people have misconceptions about either the air becoming radioactive, or containing radioactive particles that they feel would be more dang erous than the carbon dioxide. Add to these problems th e fact that you might no t have any light in the shelter, that anarchy may become ra mpant, and that there will almost certainly be no food, and perhaps, more importantly, no water and you Pa g e 8 of 42 You Will Survive Doomsda y - FREE online book of Nuclear Radiation, vi a War/Acciden... 10/10/2002 htt p ://www.ki4u.com/survive/doomsda y .htm"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"will see why no trained survivalist woul d want to be caug ht dead in the place. Returning to one's own high rise apar tment, after the da nger of blast is past, g ives much more favorable opportun ities for continued survival than given by remaining in a public shelte r. If you are ten or fifteen stories above the ground the distance will pr obably adequately protect you from any radiation from the fallout on th e ground. If there are ten or more stories above your head then that distance will also protect you from fallout on the roof. The apartment dweller shou ld try to secure an inner room without any windows. A blast fifteen or more mi les away will knock out the windows and it is the glass shards that will kill most pe ople. Pulling drapes and blinds are all helpfu l defenses. A blast wave will be preceded by a brilliant flash of light. The survivor will have from several se conds to three or four minutes, depending upon the distance from the blast, to duck behind a sofa or to take other shelter. Training oneself to take similar immediate defensiv e action can also help give protection from th e intense thermal radiation that accompanies a nuclear blast, and th at can start fires fifteen to twenty miles from ground zero. Fires, in themselv es, can be a problem and if you are downwind from a large fire or firestorm you ha ve to watch out fo r carbon monoxide poisoning. Fire defense techniques are generally well known so I wi ll not dwell upon them here. One thing you need not do is call the fire department, if you could. There is little th ey could do, if they we re still around, without central water supplies. Bu t the thing you can do is improvise closings to seal off all the apartments above yo u, and those immedi ately below you, so that fallout will not blow in and se ttle on the fl oors over your head, or otherwise near you. Now, it may be possible to organize your activities with other survivors to become a cliff dweller like those of old. A bucket on a rope might be used to haul up water gotten from a near by stream or pond, and waste could be let down in the same way. Some ingenuity may be required in providing heat and light, but if you really have sufficient supplies of food for yourself and your fellow survivors to hold out un til another crop can be planted and harvested (most survivalists recommend at least two years supply), and you seriously face up to the sanitation problems create d by morbidity, and you and your co-survivors ar e sufficiently organized against anarchy, and there are no more nearer bomb blasts - then you are probably well on your way towards continue d survival.

There may be all sorts of reasons why you elect to remain in the city rather than head for the country. If the attack comes in the winter and you do not have a planned escape ro ute, adequate clothing and supplies to make the trip, are not physically able to make the trip, and do not have a known destination of refuge, well then... Those who have most prep ared themselves and have made the best plans should pray that their fl ight does not come in the winter. During a storm, or severely cold weather, it is very likely that many more persons may be killed by exposure than by any other single cause. The roads and highways will most likely be jammed. If there ha s been an explosion in the vicinity then overpass es and utility lines may have been dropped onto the roadways making them unusable. Even without a blast having occurred, traffic jams, accidents, or vehicles j ust runnin g out of g as will probably create bo ttlenecks that completely clog the roads. Once people find themselves just si tting there, not movin g , they will abandon their vehicles. My g uess is you can for g et usin g an automobile for esca pe unless you had a plan and immediately implemented it before th e general panic set in. A motorcycle, scooter, or even a bicy cle might offer certain advantages over an automobile. One might carry a smaller form of conveyance on a larger one and then impl ement the smaller means of conveyance, such as a bicycle, when that became the necessity. The most dependable mean s of escape would probab ly remain walking. If one had to walk all the wa y out, and they were in any physical shape at all, they could surely do it in tw o or three days. Once again, proper preparation can make all the differ ence. Proper walking gear, proper survival clothing, a planned escape rout e, proper selection of material to be packed, and proper al location of loads. And, as before, there ar e better alternatives. On e could have pre-arran g ed pickup points and time s with co-survivors coming from the refuge destination, or in a worsening pre-cr isis situation you may have made an early dispersal. But the gr eater likelihood is that anyone with a practical survival plan who reacts immediatel y can get out well before the rush sets in.

That is of cour se the fallout from the weapon explosions that took place many hundreds of miles away. This fa llout may require from a few hours to a day or tw o to arrive. If the we ather permits, and the survivors know what they are doing, th ey may still have time to build an expedient shelter against the fallout. Techniques for defense against fallout have been developed and tested at g reat expense by almost every nuclear nation. Whil e information on these techniques has been made readily avai lable, most people have not availed themselves of it. Two basic techniques are available. One is to leave the contaminated area. But the extent of the contamin ated area may be far too wide to escape, or one may not have accurate information as to the delineation of the contaminated area, or they may not have the means of transportation, nor the means of survival should they reach a radi ation free area. The other basic means is to provide shelter within the contaminated area. Weather, ground, and time conditions permitting it is possible to dig a trench and cover it with dirt supported by pole s, wooden doors, or a vehicle. Properly design ed, such an expedient sh elter can make all the difference between avoiding the effe cts of fallout radiation, and not avoiding those effects. The details of how to buil d an expedient shelter ar e to be found in books listed in the bibliography . One of the most important and often overlooked factors in designing a shel ter is the matter of prov iding an airpump so as to eliminate the problem of carbon dioxide poison ing. The technique for building such an expedien t pump from materials readily available in time of crisis is also found there. The effect of fallout radiation is not always death, although many times it is. Even if it is death it is not immediate deat h. Intense radiation causes a very painful, and horrible de ath (what the lit erature calls a hard death) over several days. More likely the ef fects are drawn out over a period of weeks, months, or even year s. As the title of this document points out, all these people will have survived doomsday . It is not a question of survival but the condition of surv ival with which we mu st concern ourselves. Everyone will die eventually but it is the quality of life in the interim that is of importance.

The distance be tween the roof and the basement (a two-story house offers more than a bungalow in this way) does allow some additional protecti on, but this factor, al ong with the combined density of all the matter described, would not equa l more protection than would be afforded by six to eight in ches of earth. When, within such a basement situation, one starts to cr eate an expedient shelter using, as is us ually advised, such mate rials as bookcases and trunks (filled with earth if possible), there are ce rtain design errors that are liable to creep in. Piling dirt or ot her material on th e floor above will help but the g reatest dan g ers will be from the ar eas outside the basement wall where the foun dation extends above the grou nd. It is best to keep ones shelter at least three feet belo w the outside ground level, and to have at least three feet of soil above one's head. The next most overlooked problem is th at of proper ventilation, so as to avoid carbon dioxide pois oning. As stated before, most survival experts advise a location other th an the basement for such reasons as the threat of carbon monoxide poisoning in case of fire, broken gas mains, and the threat of fire itself that may resu lt from the wide spread firestorms caused by the thermal radiation a ssociated with a nuclear blast. There are certain advanta g es to a basement shelte r. One may have access to necessities such as food, clothing , and blankets stor ed in the home. There may still be water available from the hot water tank. And, most importantly, one may feel certain psychological co mfort by being in the familiar surroundings of their own ho me. None of thes e advantages of course hold a candle to the advanta g e of bein g in a properly equipped and manned survival center. MYTH #04: You must filter the air co ming into a shelter to remove the fallout. One of the g eneral misconceptions re g ardin g fallout and fallout shelters is that the air itself may become radioact ive. This is simp ly not true.

That is true, but a properly designed air intake, even for an expedient shelter, will cause most of the particles to drop out of the air flow before the air enters the shelter. Should the number of particles still suspended in the air be a problem, an expedient filter, such as a damp sheet hung in the air intake passageway, will do an adequate job of filtering the air. If the air vents do not have automati c blast valves then the air passage should be quickly shut and remain shut for a few minutes after the brilliant flash of a nearby nuclear explosion (so as to prevent the popcornin g effect described earlier). The air passa g es will have to be shut in every case where there is a large fire nearby th at is generating carbon monoxide that would otherwis e seep into th e shelter. Most expedient shelters will not ha ve precautions such as those just described. The danger of carbon monoxide poisoning is one of the main reasons that most survival experts recommend that even if one has a basement in their house it is preferable to buil d an expedient shelter a considerable distance outside and away from existing st ructures in case of fire. MYTH #05: Water would become radioactive. As has been mentioned before, the materials necessary for building an airpump, and an expedient radiation detector, are available in almost every home. Anyone planning on attemp ting to use the basement survival method should obtain ahea d of time the detailed instructions for building these devices, and store these instruct ions in their home , along with an emergency supply of food and contai ners for storing approximately 14 gallons of water fo r each individual that is going to be accommodated. There is a similar misc onception about water becoming radioactive as there is about air becoming radioactiv e. This may have something to do with misconceptions about the nature of heavy water , but we won't go into that here. Radioactive particle s do become suspended in water, however, and that is why for the sh elter confinement period, you must make sure that you have a sufficie nt store of potabl e water available ahead of time. During the recovery period, after ra diation has decreased to the point where it is safe to work outside, th ere are techniques for letting fallout settle out of water, and for distillin g water, in order to make sure that it is safe for drinking and co oking. However, far from keeping air and water out of a shelter, it is ab solutely necessary to life that they be available.

The matter is sufficiently comp licated that a pers on should have professional advice. However, if there wa s no doctor g oin g to be available to set a broken leg I pr esume you would go ahea d and do the best you could. And if one had to build a bridge to get acro ss a river and there was no structural en g ineer around, a g ain I presume one would have a g o at it. Doctor's would like to ha ve their x-ray machines available when setting a leg, and engineers woul d like to have their surveying equipment, specification guides, and computers or slide rules when they are building a brid g e. So you can well ima g ine a radiolo g ical defense offi cer would like to have radiation detection equipment available when giving advice in a radiation defense situation. However, if the advise, expertise, or equipment, is not available, one must g o on. One rule of thumb is that if there is not enou g h fallout that you can see it, then there is not en ough of it that it will kill you. Fallout is usually small grain dust or grit , often having a light co lor, but not always. It depends upon its source. The best place to spot it is on a smooth surface, like the hood of a car. The more dense fallou t is, probably the g reater the hazard, althou g h there isn't necessarily a direct correlation. It may fall thick enough that quite a little heap of it may be brushed up fr om a surface that is one foot square. It is possible to build, from commo n materials found around the home, an expedient radiation dete ction meter. The details for such a meter are found in books listed in the bibliography . Even if one has commerc ially available radiation detection equipment there is still some considerable ski ll required in its use. For example, almost all survey equipment is designed to be used by an adult of normal stature. This means that if the equipm ent is held in the hand of a walking adult it will tell how much radiation is bein g received 3 1/2 feet above the ground, and particularly by the adults vital orga ns which are above that level. A child's or an infa nt's vital organs will be below that level and will be exposed to much more hazardous levels than an adult's. For this reason, if one is passing through an area that is suspected to have any radiation at all, a child should be carried on an adul t's shoulders.

This is called the seven/ten rule. This is based upon standard decay. It is useful as an example, for training, and in building theoretical models, but in actual practice the decay rate is likely to be something qu ite different. It is determined by the isotopic composition of th e matter under consideration. There is another commonly held misconception among semi-trained individuals that low levels of radiatio n cannot be rapidly fatal. Someone, after several days in th e confines of a cramped expedient shelter, might conclude that because th eir meters now indicate a very low level of radioactivity (or perhaps no radioactivit y if it is a high-range instrument), that it would now be all right to go outside and sl eep on the ground in the cool breezes beneath the bright summer stars. The fallacy again arises from taki ng measurements at a level that assumes the vital organs are well abov e the radiation source. This is not the case when a person is stretched out on the ground for long hours of sleep. These lon g hours of low level radiatio n exposure to the vital or g ans will result in a fatality in just a few days. Likewise, perfectly healthy adults wh o take infants out of the cramped, unpleasant, expedient shel ter to allow them to pl ay during the day on a blanket spread out on the ground wi ll be quite shoc ked to see those infants sicken and die in just a few days while they themselves remain healthy. The infant's vital organs ag ain being close to the weak radiation source for a long period while the adults' vital or gans are being protected by distance. MYTH #07: Radiation sickne ss is not contagious so there is no danger in assisting those affected. The statement that radiation sickness is not contagious is often found in the literature. That is tr ue. The erroneous conclusion is drawn, however, that being around person s with radiation sickness is not dangerous. The danger arises from the manner in which radi ation kills. Sufficient radiation can cook the vital organs, but more often what happens is that it kills the white corpuscles and the ability of the bone marrow to make more of them. It is the white corpuscles that are the body's defenders against viruses, bacteria, and other disease causing bodies. Once these defenders are lost the pe rson succumbs to a disease they might have otherwise warded off, and once that disease takes hold in the individual they may beco me highly contagious.

It is not that the hazards ar e so onerous, but simply that we are not fam iliar with them. FOOD - Some Important Considerations MYTH #08: Food exposed to radi ation becomes radioactive and is therefore not edible. Food is the most serious problem. Most food that is in the house will not be harmed by the radiation, no matt er how intense. Th ere are three types of radiation that are found in fallout. Alpha particles, be ta particles, and gamma rays. As the first two names indicate, they are particles. They are minute (too small to be seen) pieces of atom ic matter that attach themselves to the fallou t (bits of dust that ma y or may not be large enough to be seen). In any case, these partic les may be simply wash ed off many types of foods that have a natural covering, such as eggs, bananas, potatoes, oranges, etc., or off well sealed fo ods such as those in vacuum packed cans. Foods such as grains (rice, dry cereals, etc.) that are in partially used packages that have been opened should be viewed with suspicion. Fallout dust may have crept in. The food in its unopened container or natural covering should be rinsed under flowing water and th en placed on a surface that has been similarly cleansed, before opening. Make sure that the hands (and under the nails) have been thorough ly cleansed before handling the food. There is little dan g er in handlin g such articles. The radiation g iven off by these particles is so weak that it will often not even penetrate so mething as thin as the cellophane wrapper on a package of cigarettes.

This is not to say that you need not worry about getting the alpha and beta partic les on your skin. You do . Because they can cause skin burns. However, good hygiene practice can eliminate that problem but they are a much more severe hazard internal ly than externally. MYTH #09: If you have a special radiation suit like you see in the movies and on TV you will be prot ected from th e radiation. As an aside, this is one of the reasons that those fallout or radiation suits that you see in all the pictures and movies and on TV are such a joke. Those thin g s are not g oin g to protect the g uy from anythin g , that a couple of good garbage bags wrapped around his feet and made into a hood to go over his head, would not do as we ll. In fact the garbage bags are in many ways better. They would be considered disposable. The main purpose of the fallout suits is to pr event the wearer from tracking the fallout into the shelter. The user simp ly takes the suit off at the door. If the person we re to wear it on insi de, it would defeat the purpose. There are some clean handling techniques that are beneficial to know and practice, but in a wartime situation there is so much of the stuff around that peacetime standards of exposure and clean liness lose their meaning. The g amma rays are another matter. They are very penetratin g . No fallout or radiation suit is g oin g to protect you from them . It requires much more dense matter to protect yo u than you could lift, le t alone lug around. This is why one must remain in a shelter when there is intense radiation. With good housekeeping there should not be so much dust inside a shelter as to create a hazard from gamma rays. However, be sure to dispose of the contaminated rinse water that you have used for cleaning the food containers and persons returnin g from outside. It ma y contain matter that is giving off gamma rays. There will probably not be sufficient fallout on the food packages (or you can get rid of it quickly enough) that you need concern yourself about the amount of gamma radiation that you are going to get fr om that source during the decontamination process. However, the food may have been stored in an area that has received very intense radiation. That can of beans or peaches may have been st ored right out th ere where it was receiving 1000 roen tgens of radiation per hour . An amount that would have killed you right away. Bu t it will not be harmed. That is right. It is perfectly edible. If it were not so I wo uld have told you. It is only living things that radiatio n hurts.

If the radiation is strong enough it may kill an y bacteria that happen to st ill be living in the food and thus preserve it even further. If the food is su pposed to contain bacteria (such as yogurt) I am not sure what it would do for that! Radiation preservation of food is a te chnique that is alre ady being used in industry and will probably become much more widely used in future years. Many people alre ady have radiation (mic rowave) ovens in their homes today. One further analogy. Fire will kill living animals but we use it to cook our food. Yo u really shouldn't be ov erly frightened about radiation, either. MYTH #10: New crops of food gr own in future years will not be radioactive. Food that is grown in radioactive soil, or that has not yet been harvested when, fallout falls on it is another matter. Th is food will absorb the particles of radioactive matter into its own structure and thus become dangerous. The biolo g ical food chain acts as a marvel ous strainer and concentrator of radioactive isotopes. This was well demonstrated in certain tests that took place at Almagordo. From so me intentional surface bursts and because of the unintentional venting of some underground bursts there was some fallout carried onto th e milkshed for southern Utah. The amount of fallout de posited over the surface was so slight that the most selective instruments could not detect it. An at omic or nuclear explosion releases its great amounts of energy by chan ging some matter into energy. It also changes certain amounts of matter into new and different types of matter. Without going into deta il about atomic theory, the nature of the at om with its electron rings, and its nucleus consisting of protons and varying nu mber of neutrons, let us simply say that these new forms of matter are g enerally unstable isotop es. That means they are going to change into an other form of matter. Once again, the matter, in the process of changi ng from one state to another, releases certain amounts of energy. It is this energy that we measure as radioactivit y. The energy, depend ing upon the isotope involved, may be rapidly di spelled or it may continue to be released for a very, very long time. Mo st unstable isotopes re lease their energy and transform into a stable state within fr actions of a second or at least within Pa g e 19 of 42 You Will Survive Doomsda y - FREE online book of Nucl ear Radiation, via War/Acci d ... 10/10/2002 htt p ://www.ki4u.com/survive/doomsda y .htm"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"minutes after a nuclear explosion.

For all practical purposes we can say it is not g oin g to g et any more. Once that isotope has released all its excess energy it wi ll become stable. Since the isotope releases its energy at a specified rate we can say how long it will take to lose half of its energy. After that, it will then take the sa me length of time again for it to lose (give off) one ha lf of the remaining amount of energy. Question: When will all of the energy be given off by the isotope? An ancient Greek philosop her posed the same proble m. He said, \"Suppose there is a bear at the back of a cave. On the first day the bear walks halfway to the entrance. On the next day he walks half of the distance that remained to the entr ance after the first day. And on the day followin g the bear walks half of th e distance that remained to the entrance from the previous day. The bear continues to do this same thing on each subsequent day. He walks half of th e distance to entr ance of what was left from the previous da y. The question is: when will the bear get out of the cave?\" The answer is: \"Nev er.\" This sort of regressi on is what mathematicians call asymptotic. That is to say the figures contin ue to approach zero, closer and closer, but they never reach it. So just as the bear never gets out of the cave, all of the energy is never lost. But much (one half) of the energy is lost in th e first half-life. An d three quarters of the energy is lost by the end of the second half-life. After ten ha lf lives a very large percentage of the energy is gone. It is because so much of the energy is lost in the early periods (half- lives), as compared to the later period s, that it is important to be in shelter during the early periods after fallout has fallen. We might divide the half-life times of radioact ive isotopes into three cate g ories. Very short term, medium term, and very long term. As mentioned earlier, most of the unstable isotopes generated by an atomic or nuclear explos ion are very short term. They give off all their significant amounts of energy in a matter of seconds. Unless you are within very close ran g e of an atomic or nuclear bomb there will be no way for this radiation to reach you. It was this initial radiation that caused the horrible radiation burns and sick ness at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. First the good news. There will not be any persons su bjected to long suffering from the initial radiation by the nuclear weapon s of today.

On the other hand, the survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasa ki did not have much problem with fallou t. The first major victim s of fallout were some fishermen many, many miles downwind from the Bikini Island tests. Fallout is a phenomenon much more associated wi th nuclear weapons. Nevertheless, there was fallout in Southern Utah. As stated before, it was so slight it could not be detected by the most sensitive instruments. The specific matter of interest in southern Utah was the isotope 131 of iodine. This was absorbed by minute bacter ia in the soil. In the process of filtering the iodine out of the soil the bacteria gr eatly concentrated it. The bacteria were absorbed by legume s and other biologic al forms higher in the food chain. Each in turn further co ncentrated the io dine isotope. Finally, after the iodine had found its way into the g rass a cow came alon g and ate it. Now a cow is a very complex organism in itself. Th ere are all sorts of biological activities going on in a cow. Various organs and the bone marrow filter out different mine rals for different purposes. One of these complex systems form s milk. This particular cow, and hundreds of others like it, was milked , and the milk was bottl ed and distributed to children all over the area of southern Utah. The children were also complex biological organi sms. They in turn had numbers of specific organs that specialized in straining out various minerals and compounds from the fo od that they consumed. The end result was that thei r thyroids once a g ain concentrated the iodine 131. And this to such an extent that if you he ld a radiation detect or next to their necks it buzzed like a rattlesna ke. This was not healthy. In fact numerous problems develope d among the popula tion. There were a great number of mentally retarded children born, and a number of other unpleasant ramifications. This need not have occurred from the iodine 131 if we had known what we know today. MYTH #11: There is no such thing as a fallout pill. There is a simple pill that would ha ve prevented the di fficulty. It is supplied in every nuclear emergenc y kit in Russia and available in Denmark and Sweden. Unfortunately it is not sold in North America. Fortunately, however, the pill is qu ite simple to make. Ahead of time, obtain a quantity of pota ssium iodide from your local drug store. Five dollars worth should be lo ts.

Canadians have nothing. I'll take that back. They do have lots of nuclear plants and the distinct possibility of bo mbs exploding over their heads and on their soil.

Yes, but th ose isotopes are our friends. (That may be putting it a bit strongly.) An yway, they are not near so harmful as many people think. There is th e point of view that no radiation is good for you. Some derm atologists maintain that you should not even get a suntan. (Yes, that is ra diation that you ge t from the sun.) There is even the theory that it is cosmic radiation that causes both overall g enetic chan g e, a g in g , and death. In any case we are all sub j ected to many sources of radiation every da y. The question is not whether or not you are g oin g to receive radiation, but ho w much and how quickly. Let us compare the radiation we are conc erned about with another type of radiation. Heat. Just as we measure radioactivity in roentgens we measure heat in calories. If I were to tell you that that pipe over there was g oin g to put off a million calories of heat , you might say, \"Let me get away from it!\". But, if I then said that it wa s going to be over the next million years, at the rate of one calorie per year, you woul d realize that you were in greater danger of freezing to death than of burning to death if you were depending upon that pipe for heat. It is not how much heat is going to be given off (it may be a large amount) but how much over what pe riod of time. A mere two hundred calories suddenly inflicted upon one po int of the skin wo uld create a bit of a sting, but hundreds of thousands mi ght be comfortably absorbed from a heating pad over an approp riate period of time. It is the same with radiation. Most isotopes give off their energy so rapidly that they are like flash bulb s. Flash and they are gone. It just happens right in th e vicinity of the bomb. Ot hers are like regular light bulbs that g ive off their li g ht and heat for some peri od of time before they burn out. They may trav el a long way from the bomb as fallout before they dissipate their energy . For these we need a sh elter to protect us if we are in their vicinity. Nothing else will do.

One or tw o of them in a room with you will not harm you.

Fallout is just the same way. A few pieces inside a shelter wi th you will not harm you, but if you go outside where there are mil lions of the little beasts lying around then you have had it. The only difference between their radiation and the radi ation from a little flashlig ht bulb or a match is that it is invisible radiation that you ca nnot see or feel - like that from an x-ray machine. MYTH #14: There would be no dangerous radioactivity after a couple of years. After having explained all this, now I must tell you that there are some isotopes that unfortunately do no t fall into eith er the short ran g e of initial radiation (which we do not need to worry about because it does not extend out of the blast area), nor the medium range (t hat you will be protected from by a fallout shelter), nor the very long range (that decays over so many hundreds of years that their energy is t oo weak to concern us here). These remaining isotopes are real meanies. There may be solutions to the problems they pres ent but there are no simple solutions. There will not be enou g h of them around that they will make walkin g around dan g erous for most people but the proble m is that they get into the food chain and that they have relatively short half- lives, between five and 30 years. That means that during the next couple of hund red years they are going to be g ivin g off most of their ener g y. Fortunately, some of them are rather rare, and given that they are going to be widely dissipated in worldwide fallout we can largely ig nore their effects. Others may be concentrat ed in certain areas, certain types of soil and certain foods where we can avoid them also. So they will not be that serious a problem.

MYTH #15: You are prep ared if you have a tw o weeks emergency supply of food stored. More important to the present th eme are questions as to what preparations survivors should be maki ng ahead of time. Since it will take a while to get crops grow ing again because of so cial disorganization, ozone depletion in the atmosphere, cl imatic changes, crop adaptation, early crop failures , soil deprivation, and simila r factors, survivors will need a couple of year's supply of food. Wheat and hone y are the only two basic foods, of which I am aware, th at have an indefinite shelf life. Thousand year old kernels found in the pyramids have still sprouted. Fortunately, these two f oods, wheat and honey, m eet most adult nutrient requirements. Powdered milk will be necessary if one wi shes to reduce the infant mortalities. Th e infants will not survive otherwise, unless their mothers have adequate natural milk, wh ich is unlikely. Salt is important as a preservative, am ong other purposes. In addition to storing the four basic survival foods (wheat, honey, powdered milk and salt), it is hi g hly advisable that on e also store a couple of year's supply of a variety of (non -hybrid) seeds. So me seeds will not store very well and need to be continually replaced. It is equally important to develop certain skills. Gardening skills . I particularly recommend the area of hydroponics becaus e this would be one way to grow foods free of contamination. Preserving skills . Here I recommend learning to dry foods using ho t air. Freeze-dryin g requires too much elaborate and expensive equi pment and freezing itself is not reliable when electric ity is not reliable. Preparation skills . Bread making, use of lentils, and making of many foods, or their substitutes, that today are commonly gotten in prepared form. On all of these subjects one could write a book. Indeed many books have been written on them. Ev en if one does not have time to immediately develop all these skills they might do well to get themselves a survival library and then as a next step acquir e the essentials in materials listed in checklists in most well organized manuals.

Few people could af ford the equipment that an organization can have. One well-equipped laborato ry for testing for alpha and beta particles in food costs $5,000. Alon g with other radiation detection equipment and many other types of emergency supplie s, what individual can afford it? Yet no nuclear survival grou p should be without one. Even in building a shelter the mayor expense is the entr ance and support mechanisms such as emergency lig hting, water source, etc. The incremental cost for spac e for one additional indi vidual is quite small. Thus, the greater the numb er of people the overal l cost can be spread over, the less th e average cost. Moreover, no individual has the person al resources that a group has. If the head of a single family survival group is injure d or lost the chances of survival for that group ar e much reduced. However, if it is a large group then there are numbers of people ava ilable to continue to give support. Just like there are numbers of people available to maintain twenty-four hour watches, or to create a well manned convoy to go after necessary supplies. One more prepared and eq uipped individual added to such a group is an asset, wherea s in a situation like a pu blic shelter, one more unprepared and unequipp ed individual is just another liability.

MYTH #17: Any survivors would have to live the rest of their lives underground. Many people ask how long they might ex pect to have to live in a shelter. There are no fixed answers. If your shelter is an expe dient hole in the ground you might want to stay in it no longer than was absolutely necessary. Maybe as much as a couple of weeks. If you dug a pretty elaborate hole in the gr ound you might be able to expand upon it and make it into a place where you could survive through a winter. If you owned space in a sh elter city, like there is in southern Utah or southern California, you might plan to live there the rest of your life. The co-operative shelter th at I have been describing in the previous paragraphs is not sufficie ntly elaborate that anyo ne would want to make it a permanent home. Some persons woul d probably be able to find larger and more adequate quarters el sewhere after a few weeks. Others might improve upon the existi ng structure and remain there for a year or two until more adequate homes could be built elsewhere. Decontamination procedures would pr ovide work areas, schools, and school grounds outside of the shelte r where people woul d carry on their daily activities after a few weeks. However, it might be beneficial for young children and expectan t mothers to sleep in th e shelter or a similar structure for several months.

Just th e same, certain biol ogical conditions dictate that certain individuals, (particularly the reproductively active) should receive less radiation exposure and that others may receive much larger amounts.

It may be that some limited amount of the potential for dest ruction will be used. Another rationalization often heard is that the person fe els they live in a target area such as in the vicinity of a nuclea r generating plant. In actuality the Russians ha ve little need to target the nuclear generating plants and probably can do more dama ge by not doing so . A bomb on the plant would just blow it to smithe reens and the materi al in the plant mi g ht add little to the radioactive fallout . On the other hand, as a result of the EMP, if the plant is le ft on its own when it lo ses its computer control it will go into a meltdown and add subs tantial radioactive material to the atmosphere.

About the Author The main author of this document built twenty -three fallout shelters in Kansas and Utah in th e 1960's. He completed th e US Office of Civil Defense course in 1970 after moving to Canada and then the Radiological Defense Officer's course at Arnprior, Ontari o in 1976, and the Radiolo g ical Scientific Officer's course in 1977. While in the USAF, he was a contro l tower operator and graduated as Honor Student from the AA CS supply school. Because of this training he was asked to inspect the Titan missile sites after his honorable discharge. He refused because of his understandin g of what the miss iles could do to mankind. He has been a member of various anti-war groups and his personal motto is \"Bell th e Cat and Ban the Bomb\", bu t he thinks it is now too late to do either. His master's degree is in Economics from Texas Christian University, and he holds certificates in both data processing and info rmation technology, the latter from MIT. [He has also written and edit ed several books in the field of computer science]. Prior to becoming a college teache r of computer science he was a telephony engineer an d holds both US and Canadian patents.

[Author's update note: Wh ile those two books are st ill very valuable, and it is a good idea to read more th an one author's id eas on the same subject, still there is a new book about which I am quite enthused. This book is the most recent book of which I am aware and it gives some new and updated information. From the source, presenta tion, and approach of the book it somewhat makes me think that its writing may have been commissioned or supported by the Mo rmon Church, but (which is not a negative but) whatever its source it is excellent.] The book is \"Nuclear Defense Issues\", by \" Paul Seyfried an d Sharon Packer of Ut ah Shelter Systems\". You can order in on the net from: Utah Shelter Systems or by mail (for $25) from: Utah Shelter Systems P.O. Box 638 Heber, Utah 84032-0638 U.S.A.
