Take the rope apart, separate it into the small threads that compose it, and you can break them one by one. You think, “That is all ther e was!” But twist them all together and you have something trem endous.

Show that you know first aid for injuries or illness that could occur while working on pioneering projects, including m inor cuts and abrasions, bruises, rope burns, blisters, spl inters, sprains, heat and cold reactions, dehydration, and ins ect bites or stings. 2. Do the following: a. Successfully complete Tenderfoot requirements 4a and 4b and First Class requirements 7a, 7b, and 7c . (These are the rope-related requirements.) b. Tie the following: square knot, bowline, sheepshank, sheet bend, and roundturn with two half hitches. c. Demonstrate the following: tripod and round lashings. 3. Explain why it is useful to be able to throw a rope, th en demonstrate how to coil and throw a 40-foot length of 1/4- or 3/8-inch rope. Explain how to improve your throwin g distance by adding weight to the end of your rope. 4. Explain the differences between synthetic ropes and natural-fiber ropes. Discuss which types of rope are sui table for pioneering work and why. Include the following in y our discussion: breaking strength, safe working loads, and the care and storage of rope. 5. Explain the uses for the back splice, eye splice, and sho rt splice. Using 1/4- or 3/8-inch three-stranded rope, demonstrate how to form each splice. 6. Using a rope-making device or machine, make a rope at least 6 feet long consisting of three strands, each havi ng three yarns. 7. Build a scale model of a signal tower or a monkey bridg e. Correctly anchor the model using either the 1-1-1 anchori ng system or the log and stake anchoring method. Describe th e design of your project and explain how the anchoring sy stem works. 8. Demonstrate the use of rope tackle to lift a weight of 25 pounds and pulling a log at least 6 inches in diameter and 6 feet long with the tackle. Use the tackle to put tension on a line. Explain the advantages and limitations of using a rope tackle. In your explanation, describe the potential dama ge that friction can do to a rope. 9. By yourself, build an A-trestle OR X-trestle OR H-trestl e using square and diagonal lashings. Explain the appli cation of the trestle you build. Demonstrate how to tie two spa rs together using a shear lashing. 10. With a group of Scouts, OR on your own, select a pion eering project. With your counselor's guidance, create a rough sketch of the project. Make a list of the ropes and spar s needed, then build the project. (Note: This requirement may be done at summer camp, at district or council event s, or on a troop camp outing.) 33 Bridges Monkey Bridge Suspension Bridge Double Lock Bridge"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"32 Brynbach Tower 5 Pioneering Knot List Knot or Lashing Rank/ Handbook Page Rank/ Handbook PageRank/ Handbook Page Rank/ Handbook Page Notes NotesNotes Notes Square Knot Scout Rank P. 8 Clove Hitch 1st Class 7B – P. 139 Timber Hitch 1st Class 7B – P. 138 Bowline 1st Class 8A – P. 149 Sheet Bend 1st Class 8A – P. 160 Sheep Shank Round Turn & 2 Half Hitches Basic Knots For Pioneering MB Whip & Fuse Rope Tenderfoot Rank 4A – P. 34 Two Half Hitches Tenderfoot Rank 4B – P. 36 Taut-Line Hitch Tenderfoot Rank 4B – P. 36 Square Lashing 1st Class 8A – P. 141 Shear Lashing 1st Class 8A – P. 142 Diagonal Lashing 1st Class 8A – P. 143 Pioneering MB Additional Knots Double Sheet Bend Honda Carrick Bend Prussic Rolling Hitch Cat’s Paw Pipe Hitch Rope Tackle Barrel Hitch Fisherman’s Knot Constrictor WC Shear Lashing Bowline on a Bight Butterfly Knot Water Knot Masthead Knot "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6 Rope Care and Safety SELECT BEST ROPE FOR THE JOB . Choose the right material, size and strength. STORE ROPE PROPERLY. Rope should be dry, untied, properly coiled after use. KEEP ROPE CLEAN . Dragging rope on the ground or floor causes abrasive dirt to weaken the rope fibers. KINKS CAUSE ROPE FAILURE . Kinks cause damage. Straighten them by twisting, not pulling. AVOID SUDDEN STRAINS . Jerks may break a rope normally strong enough to handle the load safety. A steady, even pull assures full strength from rope. DOUBLE CHECK all poles, ropes, knots, lashings, anchors etc. before using any pioneering structure. NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVERNEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER • Wrap rope around any part of the body except for demonstrating or using proper knots. • Trust your weight to a rope of unknown strength or condition • Use a rope as a whip 31 Ten Minute Tower "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"30 Short Splice (I) Unlay the lay of both ropes for several times t he rope diameter. A temporary whipping one will prevent unr aveling. Marry the strands together alternating one from eac h end. (II) Tuck F under E and G under D (III) First two tucks completed (IV) Rotate the splice 180 degrees and tuck H under C. This completes the first set of tucks. Continue tucking F,G and H over one lay and under the next. Remove the temporary whipping and tuck C, D and E over one strand and under the next . Tuck each lay three times 7 Rope Materials, Characteristics and Use Laid Rope Laid rope is made up of fibers twisted into yarns that are twisted into strands and laid into a rope. Braided Or Woven Rope Twelve-Strand Braided Ropes : 12 strands are braided over and under each other in a maypole fashion to create a hollow, tubular structure. Plaited Ropes : Eight strand plaited rope formed by intertwining four pairs of strands in a maypole fashion with two pairs moving clockwise and two pairs moving counter-clockwise. Double Braided Ropes : Two ropes in one, a braided core is over-braided with a cover braid, hence the terms braid on braid and 2 in 1 braid. Hollow & Diamond Braids : A hollow, tubular structure braided in a maypole fashion to produce a plain braid pattern with and without a core Solid Braids : The strands are intertwined by braiding in a circular pattern to form a solid tubul ar structure.

It has a good size t o strength ratio, does not stretch too much and handles well w hen tying knots and lashings. While it can withstand frequent wetti ng and drying it must be stored dry to avoid mildew and rot. Sisal Has a poor size to strength ratio, does not handle well and wears our quickly. While it is less expensive than manila it’s limited use and durability make it a second choice for pioneering. Cotton Braided or twisted cotton is outclassed in strength and durability by just about all other ropes. It is sui table for clotheslines and hammocks but not for pioneering or camping. Polypropylene Has an excellent strength to size ratio, handles we ll but weakens with long exposure to sunlight. Nylon The stretch factor in nylon rope makes it difficult to work with when lashing. An excellent size to strength ratio a nd durability make it a good rope for general use. Polyester Most braided climbing ropes are polyester. It handl es well, has an excellent weight to strength ratio and limit ed stretch factor. It is much more expensive than manila or nylon ropes a nd has limited use in pioneering. Polyethylene The least expensive of the synthetic fiber ropes. I t’s stiffness and poor handling qualities make it undes irable for pioneering. Binder Twine Loosely twisted jute fibers treated with oil. It se rves as a lightweight cord for throw-away uses such as lash ing small diameter poles or staves for camp gadgets. Binder t wine is used to demonstrate rope making and can serve as a reasonab ly good fire starter 29 Back Splice 1. Unlay the rope 5 or 6 turns 2-3 Form crown knot as shown. From above it should look like this: 4. Tuck one lay over the adjoining end and under itself. 5. Tuck the next strand over and under 6 Tuck the remaining strand over and under. To finish the back splice continue tucking each lay over and under several times. The finished splice "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"28 Eye Splice (1)&(2) Count back and unlay 5 rounds of the lay of the rope. 3) Fan the unlaid end of the rope and place it over the standing part of the rope. The strand to the inside of the eye must look like it is coming out from under the other two strands and the other two strands must be fanned in such a way that they do not cross each other. (4) While holding the inside strand in place, stick the middle strand under one of the strands of the standing end of the rope. (5) Pass the inside strand over the standing end strand and stick it under the next standing end strand. N0TE: The second strand goes in where the first strand came out. (6) Turn the splice over. ( 7) Stick the third strand under the remaining strand of the standing end. NOTE: The third strand is stuck in where the second strand came out and comes out where the first strand went in. [NOTE] When the third strand is stuck it appears to go backward but when it is examined closely you will see that it is stuck in the same direction as the other two strands. (8B) & (8F) Complete the splice by working the strands snug and adding 3 to 5 50unds of tucks. NOTE: When the strands are folded back over the eye, you will notice that there is one strand going in and one strand coming out between each of the strands of the standing end 9 Sail Maker’s Whipping 1 . Begin by unlaying (untwisting) the rope two inches. Make a bite in a 3- foot length of whipping thread and place it around one of the strands. 2. Re-lay the rope. Wind the whipping thread tightly around the rope end for a sufficient number of turns. 3. Carry the bight originally formed back over the end of the same strand around which it was laid. 4.Pull ends tight and tie them with a square knot between the rope ends. Trim ends of whipping thread. English Whipping Form a loop in whipping thread and lay it along the end. Wrap the whipping thread tightly around the rope. When the whipping is as wide as the rope is thick, slip the end through the loop, pull hard, and trim whipping thread. "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"10 Knot Tying Terms What Kind of Knot is it? Bend - joins two ropes together Hitch – ties rope to a post, stake etc. Stopper – usually on the end of a rope to prevent it being pulled through an opening Loop – forms a single or multiple loop. Lashing –binds objects together with multiple turns. 27 Turks Head Neckerchief Slide "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"26 Monkey’s Fist Coiling Rope Grommet 11 Knots Bends Double Sheet Bend Used to join two ropes of different diameter. Carrick Bend The first and almost always best way to join the en ds of two ropes. Computer generated knots"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12 Fisherman’s Knot The Fisherman's knot is used to tie two ropes of eq ual thickness together. It is used by fishermen to join fishing l ine, and is very effective with small diameter strings and twines. Water Knot Shown here tied with webbing the water knot can be tied in rope as well. Use wherever a strong non- jamming knot is called for to join the ends of ropes. Sheepshank Used to shorten rope under tension. 25 Pioneering Anchors "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"24 Trestle The trestle demonstrates pioneering construction techni ques. Begin by lashing the ledgers to the legs and add the b races. The center diagonal lashing should be tied last. Bracing d iagonally give the structure adding great strength and rigidity . This technique is called triangulation. Note that one end of the brace is opposite the other four ends to add locking tension to the brace. 13 Hitches Rolling Hitch If you look at this hitch closely you see that it i s really a clove hitch that ends with a turn. Best tied so that the load p ulls against the hitch as shown. Pipe Hitch This hitch will not slip on pipes, poles or other r ound objects. Celtic Knotwork "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"14 Round Turn & Two Half Hitches Provides a strong, non jamming hitch. The additiona l turn is added before the two half hitches are tied. Scaffold Hitch The scaffold hitch is made with two loops or strops to form a bosun’s chair. The chair can be used for overhead tramways or a work platform. 23 Filipino Diagonal Lashing "},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"22 Japanese Square Lashing Figure of Eight Lashing 15 Barrel Hitch Provides a lifting sling for barrels or buckets. Tw o hitches will help stabilize the load. Constrictor The constrictor knot is important as temporary whip ping and as permanent binding. Never use it if you need to unti e it. When you cannot place the knot around the object after the k not is formed, you have to tie it round the object. This may be diffic ult if you did not leave enough room to put the end through."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"16 Loop Knots Jug Knot 21 Lashings Gin Tripod Lashing A quick, strong lashing for lightweight tripods. 1. Make a loop over one of the poles with the ends leading between the other two. 2. Lead the long end of the rope above the loop and wrap it around all three poles about five or six times. Put the loop o ver the wraps and over top of same pole. 3. Pull the loop tight with the short end of the ro pe. Lead the short end over the wraps in the between two poles opposite th e loop. 4. Tie the ends of the rope together with a square knot between the ends of the poles. West Country Shear Lashing This lashing is a series of overhand knots made on alternating sides and finished with a Square Knot. Two lashings make a strong shear joint between two poles."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"20 Rope Tackle The rope tackle is used to tighten lines or lift lo ads.
