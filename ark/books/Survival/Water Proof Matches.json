To make matches water proof all you need to do is dip some wooden \"strike anywhere\" matches into melted wax. After dipping, lay them out to dry on a piece of aluminum foil. When wax is hard, remove from foil and pack them away. Bee's wax is the preferred wax to use because it stays soft whereas other waxes get pretty stiff. Either will work if that's all you have. NOTE: Don't put the wax on too thick, you could break the matches when you pull them a part."}]
