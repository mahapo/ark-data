Introduction to Krav Maga: History(video) "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" Krav Maga Official Israeli System Of Self Defense History Krav Maga first appeared approx. 40 years ago, making it one of the most modern self defense methods. It was created for use by the Israeli Defense forces. The IDF needed to teach self defense to a variety of people with varying abilities in a very short amount of time. Krav Maga was integrated into army training by Imi Lichenfield, a career IDF officer and chief instructor at the armys physical training facility at Wingate Institute. Imi is still active involved in the Krav Maga Association and maintains the role of president. Through the years, the system came to be used not only by the IDF but also by Israeli's security forces, the Mosad and the police. This system is computer tested, reexamined and adjusted on an ongoing basis. Krav Maga focuses on building readiness, physical fitness and confidence. Krav Maga is taught in many public schools in Israel. Content The style includes techniques utilized in Aikido, Karate, boxing, Judo and Jujitsu as well as a variety of techniques from a number of less well known defense methods. The style looks to build on a persons natural reflexes so that initially, the student can build up a repetoire of simple but effective techniques for various threating situations including necklocks/chokes/bear hugs/shirt holds and arm grabs . Krav Maga has no katas or specific sequences that must be followed. Students use the basic/core sequence of moves in conjunction with any one of a number of other dynamic moves to fend off an attack, the key idea being adaptability to new situations through improvisation. Also in the initial stages, students are taught to kick and punch effectively. The punching being drawn from boxing as opposed to the traditional martial art styles and low kicks to knee and groin being emphasized. Also the beginner is taught to be able to fall and roll correctly. In later stages, restraining techniques along with neck and wrist manipulation are learned along with ground- based drills. At this stage, techniques for dealing with an armed opponent are introduced. Weapons include stick, knife, gun , and bayonet rifle . Also it is not assumed that you are always unarmed and so proficiency with a knife and stick are also taught. As training continues, learning to deal with more than one armed opponent are introduced. These situations do not have specific sequences as predicting the actions of two people is near impossible and so the student must"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"use and adapt what he has learned so far to cope with a ' chaotic ' situation. At the highest levels, hostage situations are introduced i.e. drills to deal with a 3rd person being threatened with a gun also Military techniques of covert debilitation and assassination are shown. Emphasis is put on speed, endurance, strength, accuracy and co-ordination especially for intensive Krav Maga training. Attire/Equipment Initially all a beginner needs to wear are - casual track suit bottoms, soft/light shoes and a t-shirt, the preferred color of the T-shirt being white. However if training is progressed, other equipment gradually accumulated is shin-pads, groin cup, mouth guard, gi and a set of boxing gloves. Purpose A major difference between Krav Maga and other martial art forms lies in the fact that this style has no rules. The student is taught where vulnerable points on the human body are and is encouraged to use that knowledge in fending off an attack. This is a style that was developed for street use only. Due to this there are no competitive tournaments. Krav Maga has a belt ranking system. White belts for beginners, followed by yellow, orange, green, blue, brown and black. All certificates come direct from the Krav Maga Association in Israel. The information presented here will be very helpful to the beginner and will also serve as a refresher for those of you already familiar with the subject. I will start off by talking about basic things such as stance, what you should and shouldnâ€™t do when fighting and other information that the beginner will need to know. Then, I will give you a list of over 20 vulnerable points that one should always try attacking in a fight along with the way these points should be attacked. Finally, I will give you some more fighting tips and information on how you can continue learning about hand-to-hand combat.  Now, let me discuss some of the basics you will need to know when you are in any combat situation. Stance The best stance when confronting an enemy is to put your feet at shoulders length apart and your arms should be facing forward, parallel to each other and bent at the elbows. Keep your knees slightly bent and stand on the balls of your feet."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Remember, you always want to maintain this stance when you are not striking at the enemy. Balance It is always important that you keep your balance. If you use the stance I have described above, you will never have to worry about it. If by chance you do lose your balance even for a second you can kiss your ass goodbye as the enemy will probably kill you. Aggressiveness Always be aggressive and always attack. Donâ€™t just stand back and defend yourself against the enemyâ€™s strikes as he will end up killing you eventually. If you are not aggressive, the enemy will think you are scared and he will have an advantage over you. A great thing to do is yell at the enemy. This will scare the shit out of him if you start yelling at him and plus it also allows you to get more oxygen in your lungs so you will have more strength. Natural Weapons Your natural weapons are as follows: knife edge of either hand, the heel of your hands, your fingers folded at the second knuckle, your boot, your elbow, your knees, your teeth, your fore finger and second finger forming a â€žVâ€œ shape, and your fist. These body parts alone are some of the most powerful weapons you can use.  ^*^ Since you now know the basics of fighting, let me list for you the best places where you should strike your enemy. Temple A sharp blow to the temple ensures instant death since there is a large artery and nerve located close to the skin surface. If you give a medium blow to the temple it will cause severe pain and concussion but a hard blow will kill the enemy instantly. The best way to strike the temple is with the knife edge of your hand or if he is on the ground you can kick him with the toe of your boot."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Eyes The eyes are a great place to strike if you can since a good strike in the eyes will cause temporary or permanent blindness. To blind the enemy, make a â€žVâ€œ shape with your fore finger and second finger and stick them into his eyes while keeping your fingers stiff. Also, you can gouge the eyes with your thumb. Nose The nose is another excellent place to attack. Hit the bridge with the knife edge of your hand and you will cause breakage, severe pain, temporary blindness and even death. Or you can use the palm of your hand to strike upwards and push the nose up into his brain. If done hard enough the nose bone will puncture his brain and he will die. Upper Lip The upper lip contains a lot of nerves close to the skin surface so if you strike it with the knife edge of your hand it will cause great pain and if delivered hard enough he will become unconscious. Mouth If the enemy is on the ground, use the heel of your boot and strike him on the mouth. Since there are a lot of veins and arteries in the teeth there will be a lot of blood which will frighten the enemy and he will lose concentration on defending other parts of his body. Chin The chin should only be struck with the palm of your hand as you can break your fingers on the enemyâ€™s chin. Use the palm of your hand and strike the enemy with a very strong upward blow. This will cause extreme discomfort. Adamâ€™s Apple Usually the enemy will defend this part of his body well but if you do get the chance give it a sharp hit with the knife edge of your hand. If you hit it hard enough you will bust his windpipe and he will die. You can also squeeze the Adamâ€™s Apple between your fingers. Esophagus"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"If you have a chance to get a hold of his neck, press your thumbs into his esophagus (located below the Adamâ€™s Apple). Pushing hard will be very painful and it will block the oxygen flow to his lungs and he will die quickly. Neck If you give a very strong blow to the base of the neck with the knife edge of your hand you will usually break it. However, if it is not hard enough, the enemy might just be knocked unconscious so be sure to hit him in the temple or twist his neck around to be sure he is dead. The neck is the best place to hit someone if you want to be quiet as it is quick and the enemy goes down without a word. Collar Bone The collar bone is an extremely sensitive part of the body. A sharp blow to it with the knife edge of your hand or your elbow gives the enemy excruciating pain. Also, digging your finger into the collar bone can bring your enemy to his knees. Shoulder The shoulder is easy dislocated and it takes little strength to do. However, it should be done quickly. Grab the enemyâ€™s arm and pull it behind his back and then jerk it upwards quickly. You should here a popping sound which means you have dislocated the enemyâ€™s shoulder. There are other methods of doing this but this is the easiest. Armpit Although it is hard to get at, the armpit has a large network of nerves. If the enemy is on the ground, hold up his arm and then kick him in his pit. This will cause severe pain. However, it is not a very common place that will be struck in a fight but is good to keep in mind anyways. Rib Cage A strike to the rib cage with your fingers folded at the second knuckle is rather painful and if done hard enough causes severe pain and breakage. Only use your fingers folded at the second knuckle since that hurts the most. Solar Plexus The solar plexus is located on the chest at the little â€žVâ€œ shaped point where the rib cage ends. There are a large amount of nerves so a blow with the knuckle of your second finger can cause severe pain and even"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"unconsciousness. Floating Ribs The floating ribs are the lower ribs located at the front and sides of the enemyâ€™s body. Use the knife edge of your hand or the heel or toe of your boot. The blow will cause pain and will stun the enemy. Spine A blow to the spine with the heel of your boot can paralyze or kill your enemy. The lower spine between the enemyâ€™s kidneys is the best place to hit as that is the least protected part of the spine. You will only be able to attack the spine when your enemy is on the ground or if his back is turned to you. Kidneys The kidneys have two large nerves that are close to the skin surface. If you strike the kidneys hard it will cause death. You can use a fist or the knife edge of your hand to hit the kidneys. Or a kick with the heel of your boot will work too. Groin The groin is a good place to strike if you get the chance. Generally, the enemy will protect this area the most but if you have a chance, strike it with your knee in an upward motion or with your fist. Iâ€™m sure you can imagine the pain the enemy will get from it. Tailbone The tailbone which is located above the anus is a very sensitive part of the body as a lot of spinal nerves are located there. Use the toe of your boot to strike the tailbone. The pain from that is unbelievably severe. Elbow The elbow is easy to break or dislocate. Pull the enemyâ€™s arm behind him and with the palm of your hand push his elbow inwards until it either cracks or pops. When the enemy has a useless arm, you have a great advantage over him. Fingers"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"The fingers should be broken because the enemy becomes almost helpless with broken fingers. Grab the enemyâ€™s arm with one hand and with the other hand push the fingers upwards until they snap. It is only necessary to break the first two fingers. It is also helpful in breaking a grip. Knee You can destroy the knee by kicking it with the side of your boot in an upward motion. This will rip the ligaments and the cartilage. This will cause unbelievable pain and make it impossible for the enemy to move around. Once a knee has been ruined, you will have a great advantage over the enemy. Ankle If the enemy is on the ground, get a hold of his ankle and twist it until it snaps. This will make it almost impossible for him to walk and he will then be easy to kill.  ^*^ Let me talk about some more important things you should remember when you are fighting somebody. Tactics Always try to throw your enemy off balance. You can do this by charging the enemy and pretending to strike him. This will make him flinch and lose his balance. Always look for a weak spot and attack it. Whenever he leaves a vulnerable part of his body unprotected attack it with all your strength. By doing this, he will then try to protect the part of his body that you just struck thus leaving even more unprotected parts open. Use any available object that you can. By this I mean throw sand in his eyes, block his strikes by hitting him with a large branch, or any other kind of available material that can be used as a weapon against him. Foul Play In a life or death situation there is no such thing as foul play and there are no rules either. Although hitting someone in the groin is considered a cheap shot in high school, it is a very effective way of destroying your enemy. Just hit him where you can and kick him when heâ€™s down. That way, he will never get back up again."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"  ^*^ I have now explained to you the basics of fighting and the best places to attack your enemy on his body. Just because you have read this file doesnâ€™t mean you will be able to go out and kick somebodyâ€™s ass in. These methods take a lot of practice in order to do them properly. If you enjoyed this file and would like to practice these methods get a partner who is also interested in this and work on each type of strike and kick. When you first start out, go slowly and remember that these methods are deadly and do not require much force to be effective so take it easy on your partner. Some of you may decide that practicing is not enough and you would like to learn more than what I have told you in the above. Well, there are several good books with illustrations on this subject which go into much more detail than I ever could in this file. The book I used mainly to write this file was â€žThe Marine Corps Field Manual on Physical Securityâ€œ. You can get this book through a good book store or if you happen to know a marine, he can get you a copy very easily. There are also camps where you can go for 1-2 weeks to learn all sorts of things like this such as firing weapons, detailed hand-to-hand combat, doing raids on enemies and all sorts of other stuff like that. The instructors that teach these programs are well trained and have had years of experience with this. However, usually you have to be 18 years or older to get into these programs and you have to be very serious about it as well. This is not one of those programs where you can say â€žTime-out, I need to rest.â€œ They donâ€™t stop just to suit you. To get more information about these programs, you can usually find out about them in magazines like â€žSoldier of Fortuneâ€œ and other magazines with similar theme. Well, thatâ€™s it for now. Perhaps in the future I can discuss the fun stuff like fighting people with knives and all the other lethal weapons you can use in a fight. If you liked this file, let me know and I will continue on with this subject.

If you can feign symptoms of sickness and keep it up, you may be released in an interim deal. 9. Don't wear religious or other insignia. The hijackers may not share your beliefs! No T-shirts with political slogans either!"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"10. Travel in loose, comfortable clothing. If you are hijacked you'll have to keep yourself cool, clean and healthy for some time. Play mind games to keep yourself sane. 11. Don't carry military documents on board. Pack them in your main luggage. If a hijacker finds out you're connected, you'll be singled out for rough treatment. 12. If the aircraft you are on is hijacked the best way to stay alive is not to attract attention. When hijackers make their move, they are looking for opposition. Anyone who looks like they're trying to stop them is likely to be shot. 13. Keep your eyes open, your mouth shut... and don't volunteer for anything! 14. If it looks like you going to die fight back.

What is a just war? Just war principles "},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":" Back to table contents"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Home Back The \"Real\" Deal about Nuclear, Bio, and Chem Attacks by SFC Red Thomas (Ret) Since the media has decided to scare everyone with predictions of chemical, biological, or nuclear warfare on our turf I decided to write a paper and keep things in their proper perspective. I am a retired military weapons, munitions, and training expert. Lesson number one: In the mid 1990's there were a series of nerve gas attacks on crowded Japanese subway stations. Given perfect conditions for an attack less than 10% of the people there were injured (the injured were better in a few hours) and only one percent of the injured died. 60 Minutes once had a fellow telling us that one drop of nerve gas could kill a thousand people, well he didn't tell you the thousand dead people per drop was theoretical. Drill Sergeants exaggerate how terrible this stuff was to keep the recruits awake in class (I know this because I was a Drill Sergeant too). Forget everything you've ever seen on TV, in the movies, or read in a novel about this stuff, it was all a lie (read this sentence again out loud!)! These weapons are about terror, if you remain calm, you will probably not die. This is far less scary than the media and their \"Experts,\" make it sound. Chemical weapons are categorized as Nerve, Blood, Blister, and Incapacitating agents Contrary to the hype of reporters and politicians they are not weapons of mass destruction they are \"Area denial,\" and terror weapons that don't destroy anything. When you leave the area you almost always leave the risk. That's the difference; you can leave the area and the risk; soldiers may have to stay put and sit through it and that's why they need all that spiffy gear. These are not gasses, they are vapors and/or air borne particles. The agent must be delivered in sufficient quantity to kill/injure, and that defines when/how it's used. Every day we have a morning and evening inversion where \"stuff,\" suspended in the air gets pushed down. This inversion is why allergies (pollen) and air pollution are worst at these times of the day. So, a chemical attack will have it's best effect an hour of so either side of sunrise/sunset. Also, being vapors and airborne particles they are heavier than air so they will seek low places like ditches, basements and underground garages. This stuff won't work when it's freezing, it doesn't last when it's hot, and wind spreads it too thin too fast. They've got to get this stuff on you, or, get you to inhale it for it to work. They also have to get the concentration of chemicals high enough to kill or wound you. Too little and it's nothing, too much and it's wasted."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"What I hope you've gathered by this point is that a chemical weapons attack that kills a lot of people is incredibly hard to do with military grade agents and equipment so you can imagine how hard it will be for terrorists. The more you know about this stuff the more you realize how hard it is to use. We'll start by talking about nerve agents. You have these in your house, plain old bug killer (like Raid) is nerve agent. All nerve agents work the same way; they are cholinesterase inhibitors that mess up the signals your nervous system uses to make your body function. It can harm you if you get it on your skin but it works best if they can get you to inhale it. If you don't die in the first minute and you can leave the area you're probably gonna live. The military's antidote for all nerve agents is atropine and pralidoxime chloride. Neither one of these does anything to cure the nerve agent, they send your body into overdrive to keep you alive for five minutes, after that the agent is used up. Your best protection is fresh air and staying calm. Listed below are the symptoms for nerve agent poisoning. Sudden headache, Dimness of vision (someone you're looking at will have pinpointed pupils), Runny nose, Excessive saliva or drooling, Difficulty breathing, Tightness in chest, Nausea, Stomach cramps, Twitching of exposed skin where a liquid just got on you. If you are in public and you start experiencing these symptoms, first ask yourself, did anything out of the ordinary just happen, a loud pop, did someone spray something on the crowd? Are other people getting sick too? Is there an odor of new mown hay, green corn, something fruity, or camphor where it shouldn't be? If the answer is yes, then calmly (if you panic you breathe faster and inhale more air/poison) leave the area and head up wind, or, outside. Fresh air is the best \"right now antidote\". If you have a blob of liquid that looks like molasses or Kayro syrup on you; blot it or scrape it off and away from yourself with anything disposable. This stuff works based on your body weight, what a crop duster uses to kill bugs won't hurt you unless you stand there and breathe it in real deep, then lick the residue off the ground for while. Remember they have to do all the work, they have to get the concentration up and keep it up for several minutes while all you have to do is quit getting it on you/quit breathing it by putting space between you and the attack. Blood agents are cyanide or arsine which effect your blood's ability to provide oxygen to your tissue. The scenario for attack would be the same as nerve agent. Look for a pop or someone splashing/spraying something and folks around there getting woozy/falling down. The telltale smells are bitter almonds or garlic where it shouldn't be. The symptoms are blue lips, blue under the fingernails, rapid breathing. The military's antidote is amyl nitride and just like nerve agent antidote it just keeps your body working for five minutes till the toxins are used up. Fresh air is the your best individual chance. Blister agents (distilled mustard) are so nasty that nobody wants to even handle it let alone use it. It's almost impossible to handle safely and may have delayed effect of up to 12 hours. The attack scenario is also limited to the things you'd see from other chemicals. If you do get large, painful blisters for no apparent reason, don't pop them, if you must, don't let the liquid from the blister get on any other area, the stuff just keeps on spreading. It's just as likely to harm the user as the target. Soap, water, sunshine, and fresh air are this stuff's enemy.

These are the only weapons of mass destruction on earth. The effects of a nuclear bomb are heat, blast, EMP, and radiation. If you see a bright flash of light like the sun, where the sun isn't, fall to the ground! The heat will be over a second. Then there will be two blast waves, one out going, and one on it's way back. Don't stand up to see what happened after the first wave; anything that's going to happen will have happened in two full minutes. These will be low yield devices and will not level whole cities. If you live through the heat, blast, and initial burst of radiation, you'll probably live for a very very long time. Radiation will not create fifty foot tall women, or giant ants and grass hoppers the size of tanks. These will be at the most 1 kiloton bombs; that's the equivalent of 1,000 tons of TNT. Here's the real deal, flying debris and radiation will kill a lot of exposed (not all!) people within a half mile of the blast. Under perfect conditions this is about a half mile circle of death and destruction, but, when it's done it's done. EMP stands for Electro Magnetic Pulse and it will fry every electronic device for a good distance, it's impossible to say what and how far but probably not over a couple of miles from ground zero is a good guess. Cars, cell phones, computers, ATMs, you name it, all will be out of order. There are lots of kinds of radiation, you only need to worry about three, the others you have lived with for years. You need to worry about \"Ionizing radiation,\" these are little sub atomic particles that go whizzing along at the speed of light. They hit individual cells in your body, kill the nucleus and keep on going. That's how you get radiation poisoning, you have so many dead cells in your body that the decaying cells poison you. It's the same as people getting radiation treatments for cancer, only a bigger area gets radiated. The good news is you don't have to just sit there and take it, and there's lots you can do rather than panic. First; your skin will stop alpha particles, a page of a news paper or your clothing will stop beta particles, you just gotta try and avoid inhaling dust that's contaminated with atoms that are emitting these things and you'll be generally safe from them. Gamma rays are particles that travel like rays (quantum physics makes my brain hurt) and they create the same damage as alpha and beta particles only they keep going and kill lots of cells as they go all the way through your body. It takes a lot to stop these things, lots of dense material, on the other hand it takes a lot of this to kill you. Your defense is as always to not panic. Basic hygiene and normal preparation are your friends. All canned or frozen food is safe to eat. The radiation poisoning will not effect plants so fruits and vegetables are OK if there's no dust on em (rinse em off if there is). If you don't have running water and you need to collect rain water or use water from wherever, just let it sit for thirty minutes and skim off the water gently from the top.

Jesus is well known for His continued emphasis on love, forgiveness, and \"turning the other cheek.\" It is therefore surprising to find Jesus advising the disciples to buy a sword in Luke 22:36: \"But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.\" Did Jesus in this verse advocate the use of a sword for self-defense purposes? This is an issue over which Christians have vehemently disagreed for many centuries. Following is a summary of the two basic views of how Christians have interpreted Jesus on this issue. THE PATH OF NONRESISTANCE. Christian pacifists believe it is always wrong to injure other humans, no matter what the circumstances. And the same principles supporting pacifism carry over to nonresistance--the belief that any form of self-defense is wrong. This view is usually based on the exemplary life and teachings of Jesus Christ. According to Christian pacifist John Yoder, Jesus rejected the existing political state of affairs and taught a form of radical nonviolence. Central to Christ's teaching, Yoder says, is His biblical mandate to \"turn the other cheek\" when encountering violence (Matthew 5:38-48). In Yoder's view, the way to victorious living is to refrain from the game of sociopolitical control. Jesus exposed the futility of the violence engrafted in the present world system by resisting its inclinations even to the point of death. Hence, Christians are to refuse the world's violent methods and follow their Savior to the cross (Matthew 26:47-52). When Jesus told the disciples to buy a sword (Luke 22:36), pacifists suggest He was only speaking figuratively. \"TURN THE OTHER CHEEK\" ALWAYS? It is true that Jesus said to turn the other cheek in Matthew 5:38-42. However, many scholars do not believe pacifism (or nonresistance) is the essential point of His teaching in this passage. These scholars do not believe Jesus was teaching to \"turn the other cheek\" in virtually all circumstances. Even Christ did not literally turn the other cheek when smitten by a member of the Sanhedrin (see John 18:22-23). The backdrop to this teaching is that the Jews considered it an insult to be hit in the face, much in the same way that we would interpret someone spitting in our face. Bible scholar R. C. Sproul comments: \"What's interesting in the expression is that Jesus specifically mentions the right side of the face [Matthew 5:39]....If I hit you on your right cheek, the most normal way would be if I did it with the back of my right hand....To the best of our knowledge of the Hebrew language, that expression is a Jewish idiom that describes an insult, similar to the way challenges to duels in the days of King Arthur were made by a backhand slap to the right cheek of your opponent.\" The principle taught in the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew 5:38-42 would thus seem to be that Christians should not retaliate when insulted or slandered (see also Romans 12:17-21). Such insults do not threaten a Christian's personal safety. The question of rendering insult for insult, however, is a"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"far cry from defending oneself against a mugger or a rapist. In terms of following Christ's example, one must remember that His personal nonresistance at the cross was intertwined with His unique calling. He did not evade His arrest because it was God's will for Him to fulfill His prophetic role as the redemptive Lamb of God (Matthew 26:52-56). During His ministry, however, He refused to be arrested because God's timing for His death had not yet come (John 8:59). Thus, Christ's unique nonresistance during the Passion does not mandate against self- protection. THE BIBLICAL CASE FOR SELF-DEFENSE. It is noteworthy that the Bible records many accounts of fighting and warfare. The providence of God in war is exemplified by His name YHWH Sabaoth (\"The LORD of hosts\"--Exodus 12:41). God is portrayed as the omnipotent Warrior-Leader of the Israelites. God, the LORD of hosts, raised up warriors among the Israelites called the shophetim (savior-deliverers). Samson, Deborah, Gideon, and others were anointed by the Spirit of God to conduct war. The New Testament commends Old Testament warriors for their military acts of faith (Hebrews 11:30-40). Moreover, it is significant that although given the opportunity to do so, none of the New Testament saints--nor even Jesus--are ever seen informing a military convert that he needed to resign from his line of work (Matthew 8:5-13; Luke 3:14). Prior to His crucifixion, Jesus revealed to His disciples the future hostility they would face and encouraged them to sell their outer garments in order to buy a sword (Luke 22:36-38; cf. 2 Corinthians 11:26-27). Here the \"sword\" (Greek: maxairan) is a dagger or short sword that belonged to the Jewish traveler's equipment as protection against robbers and wild animals. A plain reading of the passage indicates that Jesus approved of self-defense. Self-defense may actually result in one of the greatest examples of human love. Christ Himself said, \"Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends\" (John 15:14). When protecting one's family or neighbor, a Christian is unselfishly risking his or her life for the sake of others. Theologians J. P. Moreland and Norman Geisler say that \"to permit murder when one could have prevented it is morally wrong. To allow a rape when one could have hindered it is an evil. To watch an act of cruelty to children without trying to intervene is morally inexcusable. In brief, not resisting evil is an evil of omission, and an evil of omission can be just as evil as an evil of commission. Any man who refuses to protect his wife and children against a violent intruder fails them morally.\" The Complete Book of Bible Answers , by Ron Rhodes, answers over 350 common"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Home Back The Just War Theory by Brother John Raymond Introduction There is no doubt in the minds of many that the issue of war and the Christian conscience has been a long-standing problem. When asked about war some would allude to the Just War Theory. What is this theory and how did it come about? Is it still applicable with modern warfare? What are the arguments for and against a just war? These are the questions that we wish to investigate. War Defined Before talking about a just war, one must define what is meant by war. It is \"defined as a state of conflict between two or more sovereign nations carried on by force of arms.\"(1) Looking into this definition more closely we see that war involves a state of conflict contrasted with passing conflicts such as border skirmishes or momentary conflicts. It involves sovereign nations, which rules out civil wars and riots. Also a nation fights a nation and not a particular individual or group in a nation. Force of arms excludes for example trade embargoes and blockades. These make up the basic components of a war. Origin of the \"Just War\" Most authors agree that \"St. Augustine was the originator of the Just War Theory.\"(2) When it came to individual self-defense, St. Augustine contended that one's own life or property was never a justification for killing one's neighbor. Christian charity was the motivating force behind this statement. But when one speaks of rulers of nations they have the obligation to maintain peace. This obligation gives them the right to wage war. He says, \"'The natural order conducive to peace among mortals demands that the power to declare and counsel war should be in the hands of those who hold the"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"supreme authority.'\"(3) Those subject to the rulers must obey unless they command something against a Divine Law. For St. Augustine the only reason for waging a war would be to defend the nation's peace against serious injury. He says, \"'A just war is wont to be described as one that avenges wrongs, when a nation or state has to be punished, for refusing to make amends for the wrongs inflicted by its subjects, or to restore what it has seized unjustly.'\"(4) The intention of the war is very important for St. Augustine. He says, \"'The passion for inflicting harm, the cruel thirst for vengeance, an unpacific and relentless spirit, the fever of revolt, the lust of power, and such things, all these are rightly condemned in war.'\"(5) St. Augustine emphasizes the idea of restoration of peace as the main motive of war. He says, \"'We do not seek peace in order to be at war, but we go to war that we may have peace. Be peaceful, therefore, in warring, so that you may vanquish those whom you war against, and bring them to the prosperity of peace.'\"(6) So in St. Augustine's thinking a war \"was limited by its purpose, its authority and its conduct.\"(7) Further Developments - St. Thomas Aquinas and the Middle Ages A great impetus to the Just War Theory was St. Thomas Aquinas. He emphasized St. Augustine's statements about war and added a little to them. He followed a similar reasoning breaking up his argument into three necessary conditions for a just war: authorized authority, just cause and rightful intention. In speaking about who authorizes war St. Thomas emphasizes that the sovereign has the responsibility for the common good of those committed to his care. Only he can declare war. Moreover the sovereign has the lawful right of recourse to \"the sword\" to defend his people against internal strife by punishing those who do evil, justified by St. Paul in verse 4 of chapter 13 in the letter to the Romans. Therefore it is his duty to defend the common good against external enemies by having recourse to arms. A just cause is required to wage war. St. Thomas considers such a cause to be \"that those who are attacked, should be attacked because they deserve it on account of some fault.\"(8) Finally St. Thomas discusses the right intention for waging war. Only two possibilities are presented: either the furthering of some good or an avoidance of some evil. The underpinnings of his arguments and most important contribution to St. Augustine's theory \"would appear to consist in his stress on the natural law.\"(9) The Middle Ages were occupied mostly with the right to wage war and restoring peace"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"through mercy and justice. After St. Thomas other authors on a just war such as St. Ramon of Penafort just elaborated on his position. They mainly concentrated on specifying the proper authority, just causes and intentions of St. Thomas. A Fully Developed Theory Although St. Augustine introduced the idea of a just war and the Middle Ages furthered its cause, it was not until the 16th and 17th centuries that a complete theory, which included the proper waging of a war, was established. Two names of importance regarding this development are Vitoria and Suarez. Fr. Conway, S.J., has synthesized their teaching. Hostilities are divided into two classes: an armed attack against a peaceful society and injurious actions taken against the same (generally defined as an infringement of a right). The first class from which an armed response resulted would be considered as a defensive war. This type of war was distinguished from the second class hostility. An armed response to an injurious action was considered an offensive or aggressive war. According to Vitoria and Suarez a defensive war needed \"no special moral justification.\"(10) They saw an armed response as an involuntary act forced upon a nation. On the other hand, the aggressive war needed to be justified. An injurious action done does not involve destruction and death so how was it possible for the Christian willfully to choose war as a response? The problem for them arose from the conflict between a Christian wanting love and peace but responding with death and destruction. So they proposed conditions under which a Christian could respond to injurious action while preserving Christian values. So for them the just war conditions only apply to aggressive wars. The three conditions of St. Thomas are retained by them in their theory. But they added two more: the war must be fought as a last resort and in a proper manner (without killing the innocent). Following the conditions outlined above moral theologians have tried to define them more explicitly. Regarding an injurious act it was taught that \"only an injury so grave that it outweighs the risks and losses of war is a justification for making war\" following the principle of double effect.(11) If such a weighty injury does not exist then in charity one would have to tolerate the injustice. What are sufficient causes for war? \"Grave injury to the honor of a nation. . .to the natural right of the nation. . .to the rights of the nation under positive law.\"(12) Examples of injury to honor would be"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"insulting a ruler or ambassador. Natural right injuries would include a nation's existence, property or freedom within their own nation. Violations of positive law would include breaking international agreements or treaties. Injury done to another nation can be grounds for entering into a war especially if one is allied to them or out of charity to protect them from a stronger aggressive nation. The idea of war being fought in a proper manner means that not all is fair to do in war. Three main areas of discussion here are violent acts done against things connected with religion, against people and against property. Sacred places such as churches are not to be harmed unless there is a real military necessity. A church could be used for military purposes and thus becomes a target of attack. Also it may happen that a church is next to some military target and unintentionally is harmed by attacking it. Apart from these circumstances they cannot be attacked. People during war can be divided into various categories. Combatants are \"all those who are engaged in the actual promotion of war.\"(13) Direct combatants are the fighters themselves. Indirect combatants are the unarmed helpers of the soldiers in military ways such as transporters of supplies, weapons producers, etc. Noncombatants are those people who are members of the enemy nation that are chaplains, medical personnel and civilians. Also there are neutral people who are not part of either warring party and are not involved in the hostilities. The killing or wounding of enemy combatants falls under the natural law idea of self-defense. The indirect killing of non- combatants or neutrals is permissible according to the principle of double effect. But such killing must be unintentional and unavoidable. Direct killing of such people is murder, that is, when it is intentional and avoidable. The military property of one's enemy can be confiscated or destroyed just as one can do so against an unjust aggressor. Public, non-military property may be occupied or movable goods can be appropriated. Private property both movable and immovable must be respected and only taken for some necessary purpose of war. These are the main amplifications and developments of the conditions outlined for a just war. There are other considerations that moralists have made but it is not our purpose to give an exhaustive analysis of it."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Arguments For a Just War As we have already seen St. Augustine argues from the natural order of peace to the right of rulers to declare war to maintain it. St. Thomas also sees the justification for war in the natural order but stresses more the common good of the people. Scriptural passages are used to defend the just war. St. Thomas cites another's commentary on the centurion that states, \"'If the Christian Religion forbade war altogether, those who sought salutary advice in the Gospel would rather have been counselled to cast aside their arms, and to give up soldiering altogether. . .If he (St. John the Baptist) commanded them to be content with their pay, he did not forbid soldiering.'\"(14) St. Thomas argues that St. Paul, as already mentioned, gives those in authority the right to punish by the sword disturbers of their commonwealth's internal peace. Therefore it is also their duty to use arms against a commonwealth's external enemies. St. Thomas puts forward some counter arguments to war and refutes them. The first argument says that God only punishes the sinner. Therefore when Our Lord told St. Peter that he who takes the sword will perish by it all wars would be unlawful. To counter this argument St. Thomas quotes St. Augustine who says that taking the sword is to be understood as arming oneself to kill another without the permission of authority. In war the sword is taken with permission. The second argument refers to the Divine precept not to resist evil. St. Augustine is referred to as saying such a precept is to be always kept in mind and when necessary put into practice. On the other hand, sometimes it is necessary, St. Thomas says, to act differently for the sake of the common good or the good of those one is fighting. Quoting St. Augustine a reference is made to sometimes having to punish people with a kindly severity even against their will to strip them of their sins. Finally an argument is put forward that sin is contrary to virtue. Since peace is a virtue and war is contrary to it therefore it must be a sin. St. Thomas answers this similar to St. Augustine's thought that the purpose of war is to bring about peace. Therefore it is not contrary to it. ( Click here for the full text of St. Thomas' Arguments in the Summa) A more modern author cites Melchisedech blessing Abraham when he returns from a victorious war against four kings as an example that war is \"under the law of nature\".(15) (Gen. 15; 18-20) God in the Old Testament \"many times ordered or"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"approved of war, as can be seen from Exodus and following books in numerous places.\"(16) In the New Testament a centurion was praised by Our Lord. (Matt. 8,10) Our Lord used physical force against those doing evil. (Jn. 2,15) Cornelius a centurion is called a devout and God-fearing man. (Acts 10,2) St. Paul praises warriors in the Old Testament such as Gideon, Barac, Samson, etc. (Heb. 11; 32-34) All these passages are seen as examples of God condoning war. Regarding the Church the same author says she has never condemned war. The Church has always promoted peace and tried to lessen the evils of war. Official declarations, Fathers and Doctors of the Church have recognized that war is not necessarily sinful. The Church from necessity has even promoted wars such as the Crusades and approved of military orders. Even soldiers such as Martin of Tours have been declared saints. In discussing the natural law, this author argues from individual rights to those of the State. Since an individual can defend himself against unjust aggression so can the State. An individual is allowed to seek justice for an injury or loss therefore the State can use force to compel another nation to make reparation. These are some, although I'm sure not all, of the arguments for a just war. Arguments Against a Just War \"The basic lines of objection to relying on just-war theory seem to me to come down to three points: first, the pacifist thesis that the theory is theologically unacceptable and is incompatible with basic Christian values; second, the view that the theory effectively leaves out of consideration some aspects of either the particular situation or the general character of modern warfare that need to be considered if a satisfactory and conclusive verdict on the morality of a given war is to be reached; third, the view that the theory contains so many indeterminate elements and potentially contradictory considerations that we should not be surprised that applying it does not yield a determinate result.\"(17) First let us look at some of the pacifist arguments against all war. Starting with the Bible they make the case that in the days of Jesus the idea of loving one's neighbors but hating one's enemies seems to have been an accepted principle. Jesus clearly rejects and replaces this with loving one's enemies. (cf. Mt. 5:43,44) The Old"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Testament had established love between neighbors but according to Ronald Musto, \"Christ establishes a New Law; he builds upon the old in a moral progression. Not only is one not to resist one's enemies, but one is to love them. This love applies not only to one's personal enemies but to public enemies and potential foes in battle. Ecthros, the Greek word for enemy, is used in the New Testament for both.\"(18) So those in favor of total pacifism undercut Old Testament argument for justifying war by seeing God as morally progressing His people toward the culminating point of the New Law. Also, they point out that is not so clear from the Greek whether Our Lord was addressing His statements to personal enemies or public one's . Some promoters of war see much of the imagery in the New Testament as a support of war. Gerardo Zampaglione examined the \"'imagery of violence in the New Testament and finds that in all cases it is used either allegorically or in parable form.'\"(19) Violence in parables is never the main part of the story. The same author says that \"'it is difficult to justify even the just, defensive war if one takes seriously the message of the Sermon on the Mount, which is the heart of the Gospel.'\"(20) Our Lord's driving out the money changers from the Temple is used to justify war by the righteous. Those against war claim that \"there is no evidence of violence done to people. . . Christ's action does not show the force of war; rather the scourge is used to show His messianic role.\"(21) When Our Lord refers to no greater love than when one lays down one's life for a friend pro-war advocates use it to praise soldiers giving their life for their country. But to use the text in this way is to extract it from a call to love. \"The purpose of the soldier is not to lay down his life, but to make the enemy lay down his.\"(22) The text of St. Paul that everyone must be subject to higher authorities is used to justify the State's right to require its citizens to kill in war. (cf. Rom. 13:1-7) This passage is seen by those against war to be pointing to the legitimate realm of police power in civil governments. Jean Lasserre and Richard McSorley, S.J., examine and explain the distinction between \"indiscriminate violence of war and the legitimate function of the police who seek to contain violence and uphold the law.\"(23) The same authors \"address the notion of violence done in the spirit of love and both reject it on scriptural grounds.\"(24) Jesus as our model rejected physical force and revenge that \"led inevitably to His Passion and humiliating death on the Cross.\"(25) St. Paul's writings reflect the spirit of the Gospel being lived by the Christian"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"communities. He speaks of not rendering \"evil for evil\" but of overcoming it with good. (Rom. 12:17,21) The Martyrs of the pre-Constantine era are an example of Christian praxis in the face of violent opposition. It is \"'the story of the successful Christian revolution against the Roman Empire,'\" that is, nonviolence over violence.(26) Regarding Christian military service \"before the year 172 there was none. . .Evidence of Christians serving in the Roman army before the third century is suspect. . . A study of tombstone inscriptions reveals that only 7 Christians out of 4,700 extant inscriptions were members of the military.\"(27) This evidence shows few served in the military. Of the 7 military tombstone inscriptions it is not clear whether these people converted in the service or entered already converted. In 298 Marcellus, a centurion, refused to continue military service. In front of the Emperor he claimed he would only serve Jesus Christ. Brought to trial Marcellus argued that \"he could not inflict wounds.\"(28) He was executed for defying the Emperor. In the third century \"Christians certainly served in the army; but their numbers were small, their service peaceful, and their testimony one of peace and not of violence.\"(29) When we arrive at St. Augustine his justifications for war \"are based on Cicero and other Roman thinkers. . . (with) Manichaean and Neoplatonic influences.\"(30) There is a dualism in his writings over the possibility \"to love an enemy internally and still to kill him.\"(31) St. Augustine \"seems never to have satisfied himself as to how it (war) is fully compatible with Christian charity.\"(32) During the Middle Ages while the Just War Theory was becoming more developed and Crusades were being preached peace movements among Christians flourished, also. St. Francis \"may not have been a pacifist, but 'he lived as if he were.'\"(33) A peace movement known as the \"Great Alleluia\" involving thousands of people took place in northern Italy in the 13th century. In 1233 the movement had grown to such proportions that 400,000 people gathered to demonstrate for peace and reconciliation. Another Italian peace movement known as the \"Bianchi\" moved about in thousands from city to city. Peacemaking was their major work. One chronicler notes that by the time one of these processions reached Rome its numbers had swelled to 200,000. Another approach to condemnation of war that began to develop at this time was a distinction between war in the abstract and the reality of war. These thinkers say that"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"while one can hold to war as justified in theory, in practice it cannot be justified. In the 16th century St. Thomas More was such a thinker. In his \"Utopia,\" or ideal society, St. Thomas allowed for war only as a defensive measure. But \"in reality no war that he knew in history, in the present, or in the foreseeable future was just.\"(34) So St. Thomas More used the Just War in theory to condemn all wars in reality. Some modern authors use the same approach. Fr. Emmanuel McCarthy says that he has \"found no war that has ever been fought according to the moral norms of the Just War Theory. . .(and) cannot imagine a war that could be conducted within its moral perimeters.\"(35) To sum up what lies behind many Pacifist claims is this: \"war's central action of inflicting suffering and death is directly opposed to the example of Christ in enduring these same realities. . .(it) conflicts with the essence of the Gospel.\"(36) The Just War Theory is looked upon by them as a compromise to Christian ethics introduced during the Constantine era when the Church became identified with the Roman Empire. These are some of the arguments presented by Pacifists but in no way is it an exhaustive list. Modern Warfare As we move into the modern age warfare of massive destruction capabilities Pacifists see Christian thought returning full circle to the absolute pacifism of the primitive Church. We begin with World War I and Pope Benedict XV. This Pope made very strong statements against war. \"Benedict opposed war in any form and rejected the theory of the just war as historically outmoded and theologically inadequate.\"(37) Further he rejected the distinction made between public and private morality. \"'The Gospel has not one law of charity for individuals and another for states and nations, for these are but collections of individuals.'\"(38) Pope Benedict first statement could be placed under the argument against the Just War Theory on grounds of insufficiency in modern warfare. World War II with its atomic capabilities changed the perspective on the just war. Pope Pius XII modified the traditional teaching of warfare by saying that, \"the enormous violence of modern warfare means that it can no longer be regarded as a reasonable, proportionate means for settling conflicts.\"(39) Regarding a question"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"posed to him about a self-defensive use of ABC (Atomic-Bacteriological-Chemical) warfare this Pope answered by referring to \"the same principles which are today decisive for permitting war in general.\"(40) Notice that the Pope is here making a reference to the Just War Theory. Pope John XXIII's encyclical \" Pacem in Terris\" seems to have condemned aggressive or offensive war when he stated, \"'Therefore in this age of ours, which prides itself on its atomic power, it is irrational to think that war is a proper way to obtain justice for violated rights.'\"(41) This Pope says that a proportional injury does not exist anymore to justify war. If the Just War historical account is true, the Pope in condemning the offensive or aggressive war at the same time eliminated the Just War Theory, as it applies only to that type of war (not a defensive one), as set forth by Vitoria and Suarez! It is interesting to follow Vatican II's teachings on this issue. In \" Gaudium et Spes\" the document stresses that modern weapons lead to atrocities in war far exceeding any known before. Also, the complexity of international relations can make an incipient war develop into full-scale war. Modern weapons \"can inflict immense and indiscriminate havoc which goes far beyond the bounds of legitimate defense.\"(42) Because of this reality total warfare is most definitely condemned following Pope John XXIII's and Pope Paul VI's statements on this matter. Also, modern weapons are seen by the Council as not even justified in a defensive war with their indiscriminate destruction. On the other hand, not all warfare is condemned. The Council justified \"the right of a nation to defend itself by a discriminate and proportionate use of force as a last resort.\"(43) The Council does not mention the Just War Theory but uses some themes recognizable from it such as: 1. War is to be used only after all efforts for peace have failed. 2. Government leaders have the duty to protect their people's interests - the common good. 3. A right intention rules out force being used for political or military objectives. 4. Not all is fair during war. 5. Indiscriminate killing of the innocent is prohibited. So after the Council the idea of war comes down to this: \"war is not morally justifiable . . .to punish an offense or. . .to recover a thing, but is justifiable only. . .to repel injury and aggression.\"(44) Any strategy with the intention of attacking cities or large areas along with their populations cannot be morally tolerated, even as a last resort."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Further developments among Bishops and Popes to the present involve a Catholic policy where nuclear deterrence can only be a temporary solution. The Catholic goal is to de-nuclearize the world. Arms control, even as an important contribution to present day problems, is not enough. Only a strategy that tends toward disarmament is an acceptable strategy for the Church. Two principles from the Just War Theory stand out in all of this modern day analysis. War is limited by the immunity of noncombatants and the general principle of proportionality. The former limits the widespread destruction of ABC warfare. The latter even limits legitimate self-defense. The relatively recent Gulf War provided moralists with a modern day war example to analyze. Francis Winters claimed that \"on balance the theory failed the test of providing wise judgment.\"(45) Another author thought the theory could be applied to it with some adaptations. Although at the same time he recognized a \"serious problem in how we understand and apply the notion of noncombatant immunity. . .(and that) the principle of proportionality is all too likely to raise large questions that require political judgments and do not yield definite answers.\"(46) These problems of applying the theory would seem to point to the argument already mentioned that the Just War Theory cannot yield a determinate result. The modern war debate is far from over. Some talk of a limited nuclear war. Others claim that the limitation of war is impossible. One thing is for sure - if the limited war people are wrong the destruction of the world will end the debate! Conclusion In this investigation we have tried to provide a general survey of the history of the Just War Theory with some of the arguments for and against it. As we have seen St. Augustine is considered the originator of the theory. St. Thomas Aquinas and other Middle Age authors further clarified its justification. The proper authority, just causes and intentions for waging a just war were further elaborated on at this time. Victoria and Suarez in the 16th and 17th centuries fully developed the Just War Theory. They distinguished between offensive and defensive wars. Also they added two more conditions to the theory: war as a last resort and the proper manner of fighting a war."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"From there we move into the modern age of warfare with its potential for massive destruction. The Popes of this World War century rule out aggressive wars leaving only defensive wars. The principles of proportionality and immunity of noncombatants are an important contribution of the Just War Theory to the modern situation. Whether or not the theory itself is still applicable to war at present is still being debated. On the question of the justification of war different arguments are put forward. Both the Old and New Testament are used to show war is not against the will of God. Also of importance related with this is the special authority given to government leaders to safeguard the natural order and the common good. Another argument put forward is to reason from the rights of the individual to those of the State. Finally an appeal is made to the history, teaching and practice of the Church. Those against war argue mainly from Sacred Scripture, especially the New Testament. The main claim made is that Jesus taught and lived a nonviolent position. St. Paul and the primitive Church continued this tradition. The Constantinian era compromised Christian thought by identifying the Church with the State. Nevertheless, examples of pacifist movements can be seen in later Church history. A different form of argument especially brought forward with St. Thomas More is the possibility of a just war in theory but impossible in reality. Others attack a Just War Theory as irrelevant in modern warfare. Still others claim the theory is useless in coming to conclusions. Certainly this issue is relevant and important in our modern era. While we debate other moral questions the threat of the gravest moral evil constantly hangs over our heads - the suicide of mankind. Fortunately even if the war issue cannot be resolved at least the Just War Theory provides a limiting factor. Also, efforts are being made to eliminate ABC warfare and promote peace. Certainly more people need to see the urgency of this issue for our modern world.

All non-violent options must be exhausted before the use of force can be justified. l A war is just only if it is waged by a legitimate authority. Even just causes cannot be served by actions taken by individuals or groups who do not constitute an authority sanctioned by whatever the society and outsiders to the society deem legitimate. l A just war can only be fought to redress a wrong suffered. For example, self-defense against an armed attack is always considered to be a just cause (although the justice of the cause is not sufficient--see point #4). Further, a just war can only be fought with \"right\" intentions: the only permissable objective of a just war is to redress the injury. l A war can only be just if it is fought with a reasonable chance of success. Deaths and injury incurred in a hopeless cause are not morally justifiable. l The ulimate goal of a just war is to re-establish peace. More specifically, the peace established after the war must be preferable to the peace that would have prevailed if the war had not been fought. l The violence used in the war must be proportional to the injury suffered. States are prohibited from using force not necessary to attain the limited objective of addressing the injury suffered. l The weapons used in war must discriminate between combatants and non-combatants. Civilians are never permissable targets of war, and every effort must be taken to avoid killing civilians. The deaths of civilians are justified only if they are unavoidable victims of a deliberate attack on a military target."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"free stuff Find old friends Get a date Free downloads Webmaster$$$ ANTI-TERRORISM CLASS FREE INFO!
