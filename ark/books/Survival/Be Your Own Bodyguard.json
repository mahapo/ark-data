Before delving into this treasure chest of safety tips, it’s necessary to understand a bit of rudimentary predator psycholog y. Whether you’ re dealing with pr o wlers, con-artists, or serial rapists, rarely do the heart- breakers and life-takers of the world pick their victims at random. This w ould be much too dangerous, with a high risk of getting hurt or being caught. Instead, predators tend to pick their victims very carefull y, and the y usually conduct their attacks in three stages: 1. Identify a likely target. During this stage , the predator hunts for vul - nerable pr ey. “Good victims” are usually unaware of their sur r oundings, or appear to ha v e weak defenses. This guide will help you a v oid giving the impression that you might make easy pr ey. 2. T est the target. T o lo w er the risk of being hurt or caught, predators usually check the cooperativeness of potential victims. This can be done co v ertly by observing the habits of potential victims and searching for opportunities to strik e, or it could take on a co v ert form, such as verbal or psychological “tests”. This guide will help you a v oid offering exces - sive opportunity in your daily habits. 3. Assault the target. Once the predator is reasonably confident that he will be successful, he commits the assault. Unfortunatel y, it’s be y ond the scope of this guide to offer techniques for responding to violence–our verbal and physical training courses address these com - plex issues. Ho wev er , b y following the tips and tricks in this guide , y ou will substantially lo w er your chances of e v er reaching this stage of the assault. Of course , y ou can ne v er completely eliminate the chances of violent conflict, and that is why physical and verbal training is a vital par t of any personal protection strateg y.

Strengthening your home , whether you live in a house , an apartment, or a condominium is a matter of looking for weaknesses the same way burglars do. General tips Case the joint! Start the process of fortifying your home by looking at your house or apartment from a burglar’s point of vie w. “Case the joint” as a burglar would and look for weak spots in your defenses. Ask yourself,“how would I break into this place?” The tips in this book - let will help you strengthen weaknesses. Remember that burglars lo ve to work in concealment, and keep these questions in mind as you g o conduct your search: • Are your windows and doors hidden from the view of y our neighbors? Av oid giving burglars privacy to work on break - ing into your home . Problem areas include windows or doors hidden by high hedges, lack of lighting, or entry ways that are hid - den from vie w, such as garage-to-house doorways or deep win - dow wells where a burglar can work undisturbed and unseen. • Do you offer robbers easy access to loosely-guarded win - dows via trellises, downspouts, and utility poles? Some bur - glars specialize in 2nd-story entry or “balcony-hopping” wher e they mo v e from one apartment to another by way of balconies. Don’t assume that a high window is a secure windo w. Once a burglar has made it inside , he can exit right through the front door with your valuables. • Do you display signs that you’ r e not home? Burglars often learn the habits of their victims, and they know what a vacant house looks lik e. When you lea v e home , av oid the obvious piled newspapers or mail. Timed lights and radios that turn on at the same time e v ery day are good, but alternating intervals are e v en better . Most personal safety catalogs offer devices to control the timing of se v eral lights and appliances throughout the house . A single light that ne v er turns off is a sure sign that the occupants are not home . P eaceful Paths Personal Safety Tr aining Be Y our Own Bodyguar d Motes & allig ator s?

What follows is a list of deter r ents, including infor - mation on alarms, dogs, and methods for safeguarding your property and becoming your own bodyguard! Houses Lighting: One of the most important deter r ents for houses is light. Houses usually offer many more points of entry that do apartments or condominiums. Doors and windows should be in plain view and well- lighted from the outside . Open, unconcealed spaces are an excellent deter r ent–it’s hard for a burglar to work when he is in plain view of the neighborhood. Be sure that your lights are not all at the same le v el and easily accessed from the ground. Lights with motion sensors ar e becoming cheap and easy to install–consider using them at strategic places outside your house such as walkways, side yards, or other areas that are not commonly used at night. Be sure to light your alleywa y and back yard to discourage predators from lurking unseen and study - ing your home and habits. Y ou might also consider installing a panic switch (independent of your alarm system, or integrated with it) that will flood your house with light, both inside and out. Lighting your house may frighten off intrud - ers before they enter , and it can draw attention to your house . Be sure that the numbers on your house are large and well-lit. This will help emergency personnel respond to your house more quickl y. Automatic gara g e doors: These can be particularly tempting to burglars because they are easily jimmied and often pr o vide easy access to the rest of the house . Garage doors should sound an alarm if opened without the remote . If you lea v e town, be sure to unplug your automatic opener . Y ou can also drill a hole through one or both of the door tracks and insert padlocks when you’ r e gone . This pr ev ents the door from being jimmied, and also deters a thief from stealing your car P eaceful Paths Personal Safety Tr aining Be Y our Own Bodyguar d No priv acy Lighting is one of the most important defenses for any home .

Garage-to-home doors (the passageways that connects a garage and house) are fa v orites among burglars because they are generally com - pletely concealed, and usually flimsy . Be sure that this passageway is strong–see our section on doors & windows to help you fortify this w eakness. Apartments, condominiums, and dormitories Whereas houses tend to offer criminals more points of entry than a partments and condominiums, the latter present their own set of saf e- ty concerns because of the increased traffic of strangers in and around y our building. Managers, landlords, and maintenance people may ha ve ke ys to your unit, security among other tenants may be lax, and the la y- out of your building may offer predators concealed access to your doors and windows, or e v en concealed access to you in elevators and laundry rooms. But in spite of these challenges, y ou can still be your o wn bodyguard by becoming aware of the opportunities that predators search for . Ke ys: Y our first concern when moving into a new unit should be the ke y to your front door . Many people ha v e lived here before you, and y ou may be surprised to learn how many people could still ha v e k e ys to your unit. The solution to this problem is simple and cheap: install a new lock whene v er you mo v e into a new unit. When you give the ne w ke y to management, place it in a sealed, notarized en v elope . Establish a clear understanding that the k e y may only be used in case of emer - gency , and routine maintenance should be scheduled for when you ar e home . This should discourage management from taking advantage of y our k e y–if not, y ou might be living in the wrong complex. Elevators: Elevators can be dangerous areas in any building. Muggers, rapists, and other criminals often use this environment to trap their pr e y by pressing the emergency stop button, or by car r ying them to a floor where their criminal cohorts are waiting. Here are a f e w tips to k eep in mind any time you ride an elevator : When waiting for an eleva - tor , stand away from the entrance so that you are not pulled or pushed in when the door opens. If you are on an elevator with a stranger , position yourself next to the control panel so that you can exit the ele - vator if you need to , and so that a predator doesn’t ha v e easy access to the emergency stop button. If e v er you are uncomfortable entering an elevator with a stranger , simply wait for the next car .

A couple of moments spent waiting for the next car is a small price to pay for peace of mind. Stairwells: These areas can be as dangerous as elevators, if not mor e so . By la w, stairwells are constructed to be fireproof. The heavy , latch - ing doors tend to insulate sound, and this could put you in a precarious position if confronted by a predator . The same rules that apply to ele - vators apply to stairwells: If you’ r e uncomfortable , lea ve. If you ar e under attack, y elling “fire” in apartment buildings, hotels, or businesses will attract attention–much more so than on the street. Laundry Rooms: Unfortunatel y, laundry rooms are often ideal envi - r onments for predators. Many times they are located in the corner of unpopulated basements, and they can be deserted and dangerous dur - ing non-peak hours. Additionall y, some laundry rooms ha v e windows that are left unlatched for the sake of ventilation, creating easy access f or strangers. As much as possible , use the laundry room when you know that others will be around, and be sure the landlord hasn’ t propped the window open for ventilation so much that a stranger could work his way in. Secured entry ways: In many complexes, secured entry ways that r equire strangers to be “buzzed” in by a tenant actually offer little security against someone who truly wants to get in. Criminals can pr e- tend they ha v e legitimate business and slip in with someone who has a key, they can dupe tenants with any number of claims that they ar e there to do repair work or e v en that they are authority figures, or the y can simply push se v eral buttons with the sure knowledge that someone will buzz them in unchallenged. The best defense is for all tenants to take a secured entryway seriousl y. Ne v er let strangers in, no matter how harmless they may seem. If the y truly had legitimate business in your complex, they would be buzzing the people they came to see , not bothering you. And ne v er lea v e front or back doors propped open as a “fa v or” to a friend (a habit common to dormitories). This renders your first line of defense completely use - less and puts your neighbors in danger .

Please refer to our section on securing these doors. Make sure your front door has a peep-hole .

Most burglaries occur during the da y. Ha v e your complex increase security during this time , as it is usually lax. Be sure you ha v e at least one solid-core deadbolt on your front door . See our section on locks for tips on selecting a deadbolt. A door chain is also a good idea, but the only chain worth its salt is one that bolts into the door frame and loops o v er the doorknob , and is made of heavy steel.

All locks can e v entually be jimmied or broken. The question is, how long will it take? Old-fashioned k e y-in-knob locks are the easiest to jimm y. They can often be broken with a strong twist of a scr e wdriver . Even a g ood, strong deadbolt can be broken with a swift kick–not because they are weak, but because the strike plate is usually poorly mounted into the door frame with small, shallow scr e ws.

Reinforce this lock with at least one deadbolt. Deadbolt: These locks should be solid cor e, which means that the part that slides into the door frame is steel or has a steel cor e. It should extend at least one inch into the door frame . The strike plate (the flat piece that you mount on the door frame) is just as important as the lock, but is often o v erlooked. Don’t mount this piece with the small, one-inch scr e ws that come with the lock. Instead, purchase larg - er scr e ws that are at least three inches long with a course thread. These longer scr e ws should mount all the way into the frame of the door , not just the trim, to pr ev ent the lock from being defeated with a kick. T o further strengthen this weak link, y ou can purchase a heavier strike plate than the one that came with the lock. When you buy a deadbolt, don’t skimp . A f e w extra dollars will buy y ou a good barrier against the knuckleheads of the world. Medeco locks are of exceptional quality , and two deadbolts are optimal. P osition them at least 18 inches apart so that the force of a blow is ev enly distributed. In houses and condo’s, consider installing a security storm door that has its own double-k e y deadbolt. This pr o vides an exceptional physical barrier because the storm door will open outward, therefore making it impossible to kick in. A double-k e y deadbolt pr ev ents the possibility of breaking the glass and unlocking the door–just make sure that if you lock it at night you keep a k e y close to the door so that you don’t pr e- v ent escape during an emergency . Cane bolt locks: These locks are mounted at the top and bottom of the door , and slide into the upper and lo w er frame of the door . The y are very effectiv e. If your door opens outward: If your door opens outward, the hinges are probably exposed and the hinge pins could be remo v ed. This is a burglar’s dream.

Drill into the door-side of the hinge a hole about 1/4 inch deep and 1/4 inch wide where the scr e ws used to be . On the frame side of the hinge , mount a 1/4 inch headless scr e w that protrudes 1/4 inch. When the door is closed, the headless scr e ws will project into the door , “pinning it” and making it impossible to easily remo v e the door e v en if the hinge pins are remo v ed.

General safety tips for doors: • Make sure your deadbolts are good quality , solid cor e. • Lock doors e v en if going out for a minute . • If you mo ve, ha v e a licensed locksmith change the locks or do it y ourself. • Give extra protection to concealed entrances. If a door is una v oidably concealed from the view of neighbors, install at least two deadbolts, or consider cane bolts. Security storm doors pr o- vide an excellent physical barrier . • All external doors should be a minimum one and 1/2 inches thick, solid cor e. If your doors are hollow cor e, they can be penetrated with a bare fist. Solid-core with a metal shell are the most secur e. • Strike plates must penetrate the door jamb and frame . Use three or four inch scr e ws with a course thread, and use L-shaped strik e plates–these are stronger than the standard cur v ed strike plates that come with most locks. Use hardened steel deadbolts. • If you ha v e a window within 44 inches of your doorknob , use a double-k e y lock to pr ev ent someone from breaking the glass and r eaching in. But be sure that you and your family keep a k e y close to the lock so that you are not trapped inside during an emer - gency . • Replace small windows that are close to the door or in the door with lexan rather than glass. Lexan plastic is very hard to break. • If you use two or more locks, position them at least 18 inches a part. • If the door opens out, pin the hinges. Sliding glass doors These doors, as they come from the factor y, are particularly easy to penetrate because they can be lifted from the tracks, or the flimsy locks can be jimmied.

Be sure that this part of the door is securely bolted to the frame from the inside so that it cannot be pried out. • Don’t gain a false sense of security by laying a broomstick in the track of your door . This can be defeated with a common coat-hanger slipped between the doors. Instead, purchase a hinged prop that can be mounted on the sliding door rather than the frame . • T o pr ev ent the sliding portion of the door from moving, any number of small deadbolts can be mounted at the top and bottom of the door . They usually require that you drill a hole into the non-sliding panel, taking care not to crack the glass. • T o pr ev ent the sliding portion of the door from being lifted and r emo v ed from the track, y ou can mount scr e ws into the track abo ve the door so that they extend far enough down to pr ev ent the door from being lifted when it is closed, but not so far that it interferes with the mo v ement of the door . Mount these scr e ws e v ery eight to ten inches. • T o permanently lock a door , y ou can drill through the bottom of the frame and into the track, taking care not to crack the glass. Drilling three or four holes, spaced e v enly along the bottom of the door , and scr e wing the door frame into the track will secure the door , but be a ware that you ha v e eliminated an emergency exit. While these scr e ws can be remo v ed, they can’t be remo v ed in less that 5 minutes or so (this option is best for the non-sliding portion of the door). As an easily-removable option for the sliding portion of the door , consid - er placing three or four nails than can be easily pulled out. • If you own your unit, consider installing a second sliding door in front of the first, or persuade your landlord to do it if you are renting. This will pr o vide heat insulation, as well as an added barrier that pr o wlers w ould just as soon not deal with. Windows • Of course the first line of defense with windows is to ha v e them in plain vie w, and well lit. See our section on lighting.

If you are concerned about any particular windo w, inquire at your hardware store about locks that require k e ys from the inside . Remember to store your k e y near the window in case of emergency . • If you install bars, be sure that you can open them from the inside . • Reinforce deep window wells with horizontal bars that are secured b y a cable with a release mechanism so you don’t eliminate an emer - gency exit.

Dogs Dogs, particularly large , f ormidable breeds, are one of the most effec - tive deter r ents against intruders.

Alarms Alarms are meant to accomplish two tasks. First, they ser v e as a deter - r ent to criminals. Second, they pr o vide a warning to you. In order to meet these goals, an alarm system should be fairly obvious (that’s wh y they come with window stickers and yard signs) and they should be loud and bright when tripped. Silent alarms that are used by business - es can backfire on families by failing to chase away the assailant. Alarms should not only alert you, but also the police and your neigh - bors by way of horns and lights. If an alarm only alerts the occupants of the house , the only one who will hear the alarm if no one is home is the burglar . A professional burglar can silence an alarm in less than 30 seconds, so it’s important that others immediately know that the alarm has been tripped. At minimum, an alarm system should include the following: 24-hour monitoring by trained professionals, control pad, audible alarm, door and window sensors, window stickers, battery backup , and a panic but - ton. Make sure that sky lights and 2nd story windows are co v ered b y the system. Don’t forget the all-important alarm on the garage door . Before selecting a compan y, check the response time with neighbors. If their response time is more than five minutes, it is too long. Additionall y, they should pr o vide immediate response to panic buttons and se v ered lines. Remember that no matter how efficient an alarm is, it does not pr o- vide any physical barrier against intruders.

About alcohol Alcohol in any environment increases your chances of injur y. Alcohol is often a factor in violent acts including family violence , sexual assault, rape , assault and aggravated assault, m urder , and suicide .

When alcohol is in v olved, always tra v el in groups, or with someone you know very well. Some of the warning signs for alcoholism include: • Frequently needs a drink. • Obsesses o v er alcohol or drinks alone . • Frequent difficulty remembering what took place when drunk. • Lies to conceal drinking. • Argues with friends and family members about drinking. • F eels that alcohol enhances performance , or needs alcohol for certain activities. • Ignores work, school, or family obligations for alcohol.

More often then not, guns are used on the wrong person or by the wrong person–guns kill many more family members than burglars. The bottom line is, if you ha v e a gun in your house you are much more lik e- l y to incur a tragic e v ent than you are to a v oid one . If you ha v e a gun, assume that a child will find it, ev en if you don’t ha v e children. Don’t keep or car r y a gun (or any other weapon for that matter) unless you are willing to use deadly force . If you hesitate , it can be taken and used against you. If you wish to car r y a concealed gun, be aware of the laws in your area. In some places, it’s completely illegal to car r y concealed weapons, and in other places you need a permit. Be aware also that shooting some - one on the street is much harder to justify than in your house . Even in y our own home , despite the common misperception of so-called “mak e m y day laws,” most states fr o wn on homeowners shooting intruders. It m ust be pr ov ed that the homeowner’s life was at stak e, and that the shooting was committed in self-defense . This is a burden of proof that lies entirely on the homeowner , and failure to pr o vide this difficult evi - dence can result in devastating lawsuits.

This in itself may be enough to sa v e your lif e, but any deter r ent must be accompanied by training. If you car r y pepper spra y, car r y it at the ready when you are in a ques - tionable environment–it won’t do you any good if it’s at the bottom of y our purse when you need it. Make sure that your pepper spray is fully-charged. If you ha v e any concern about its functionality , purchase a new canister . When purchasing spra y, make sure that it has at least 10 continuous seconds of spra y, and that it is at least 10% OC (oleoresin capsicum–the hot stuff). Practice with your pepper spra y.

Don’t be surprised if you need to hit an attacker more than once with pepper spra y. Other deter r ents Stun guns are more useful as visual deter r ent than as a weapon.

Additionall y, it can take up to four seconds of continuous contact to immobilize an assailant. That is entirely unrealistic during a struggle . W orse yet, because this weapon r equires that you physically struggle with your attacker , there is a good chance that this weapon can be taken and used against you. Even if you don’t ha v e a weapon at hand, virtually any item can be used to distract an attacker long enough to escape . A rolled-up magazine jabbed to the throat, a pencil jabbed to the face , or the corner of a book to the e y e might possibly buy you a f e w seconds. A common bit of advice is to interlace your car k e ys between your fin - gers and punch your assailant in the face .
