Whatever your background or preparation for the situation in which you find yourself, it is important to get over the initial trauma quickly . Remember that the circumstances you are in are no dif ferent to those that men and women have known – and survived – for centuries, even to this day in remote areas throughout the world. Although you may not be aware of it, you already have the necessary qualities to survive built in – determination, perseverance, ingenuity and humour . All you need to do is to adapt them as quickly as possible to your new circumstances. Y ou may not be used to having to go out and forage for food or to locate sources of water . But remember that the qualities and skills you use in finding and holding down a job, and in negotiating the best deal for yourself and your family in your daily life, are similar to those that men and women have always used to find shelter , warmth and food for themselves and their families. As you adapt, you will find that if you take sensible precautions in a planned way your body will adjust as far as possible to the environment you are in. Y our senses, somewhat dulled by urban comforts, will become sharper and your mind will begin to deal with planning your daily requirements."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"If you hold on to your determination to survive, despite setbacks, you will begin to master your environment. By maintaining a positive attitude you will find the necessary will and energy to locate food, water and shelter , and to set about achieving rescue. A thumbnail guide to survival If you are cold, wet, hungry and maybe injured, your immediate priorities are to: Account for survivors. Carry out First Aid. Find the right clothing and survival equipment. Find shelter. Provide warmth, water and food. Rest. You will be in a far better position to cope with your circumstances and plan a survival strategy once you have dealt with these necessities. The order you take them in will depend on your particular environment, and you will find guidance in the appropriate chapters in this book. If you are in a group, you can each be responsible for a task. No matter how tired you are, set about collecting branches and wood to make a shelter (unless you have other materials to hand), make a fire, and take as much food and water as is appropriate, according to your available supplies. Remember not to eat too much if you have little water ."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"By constructing a shelter and providing yourself with warmth and sustenance you will greatly improve your morale and your ability to cope. Y ou will also have made it possible to gain much-needed rest, which will make it easier to go about your various tasks. Do not allow yourself to worry too much about the wider picture, since you will need all your concentration and energy for the immediate priorities. By putting one foot in front of the other and achieving things bit by bit, you will gradually surmount the problem."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Plan for survival Once you have answered your immediate wants, you will need to decide whether you should stay and wait for rescue, or travel in search of help and civilisation. If you are near a large object such as an aircraft, it will be much easier for rescuers to find you. If you are under a thick jungle canopy , however , you may need to travel so that you can either find a clear area in which to signal from or a place of human habitation. Location Try to pinpoint where you are. Are you near any recognised routes? If so, your chances of being found are good. If not, you may wish to consider moving to an area where you are more likely to be found. Radio equipment Check to see if there is a working radio, and try to establish contact."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Equipment Draw up an inventory of equipment in your possession, and also any materials that may come in useful. Supplies Check your available supplies of food and water , and ascertain how far you are likely to be able to walk with what you have. Physical condition Check your own physical condition and that of others. Y ou may need time to deal with wounds or recover your strength. Y ou will need to weigh this up against the likelihood of being able to find suf ficient food and water in the area you are in. Weather Do present conditions make it likely that a rescue search could be successfully mounted? If you plan to travel, what does the weather portend? Do you need to wait for better conditions? Signalling"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Check all available signalling equipment and have it ready to use as soon as possible. You do not want to miss your chance if an aeroplane suddenly appears overhead. How to use this book The first part of the book is divided into physical types of regions, namely Desert, Sea, Tropics, Polar and Mountain, with an additional chapter on how to cope with Natural Disasters, such as earthquakes and hurricanes. The second part gives more detailed information on particular aspects of survival, such as navigation or firemaking. Read through the chapter that applies to your environment first. It will give you hints on what your priorities are and how to go about them, such as building shelters and where to find water and food. It also lists dangerous animals to be avoided. The mental and physical quality that is most required of you as a survivor is endurance. It will not be easy to solve all the problems with which you are faced. Only you can decide on what you can endure. Rely on your training, initiative and God- given skills to solve the rest."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"P 1 Any journey that takes us away from our familiar world, with its easy supplies of water, food, warm clothing and sources of heat, to some extent places us in the survival category. Preparation and Equipment eople travelling by car in a country as populated as the United States have been cut off in blizzards and caught in snow drifts for hours before rescue services could reach them, and no doubt found themselves wishing they had brought more warm drinks, warm clothing, food and water ."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Those who set out on long expeditions to remote mountains, deserts or across oceans will be fully aware that they are embarking on a journey of survival and will have made the necessary preparations. Even they , however , may be overconfident of their fitness and the quality of their pack, and may find themselves overstretched or caught out by the variable forces of nature. However well equipped you may be, it is always best to be aware that chance and accident can place you in a dangerous predicament. The more aware you are of the potential hazards the better prepared you are likely to be to cope with them. A compass, matches, torch and fishing kit are several of the many items a person should have with them in a survival situation. One of the first rules of survival is not to take for granted the methods of transport or organisations you may be relying on. Learn to prepare and equip yourself so that you are one step ahead of the worst eventuality . PLANNING The adage that time spent in planning is never wasted applies as much to survival as it does to of fice work. Simply thinking through a journey in advance, and considering some of the options if things do not work out as scheduled, will be time well spent. You will find that if things do go wrong you will be prepared. Y ou may be able to prevent a good deal of inconvenience, or even save the precious moments that could mean the dif ference between life and death for yourself and others. If you are setting out on an expedition that will involve any measure of endurance and exposure to the elements, detailed planning will obviously be necessary . This should be geared to the particular requirements of the environment you will be in. Equipping a vehicle with the right tools, a medical pack and spare food and water is a significant step in the right direction. EQUIPMENT Owing to the current vogue for outdoor equipment, the greatest danger is not so much not knowing what to wear or carry but being bewildered by choice and ending up with the wrong equipment. The best approach is to ask trained staf f in a specialist shop, many of whom will be outdoor enthusiasts themselves. They will help you to cut through the jungle of rival products and give you straightforward advice on what you"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"require for your particular circumstances. For example, there is an endless range of excellent boots for sale which may leave your mind buzzing, but if you are intending to go mountain climbing the selection can be quickly narrowed down by an expert, saving you time and energy . Real deal One note of caution is that since the fashion industry has adopted the ‘outdoor look’, you will need to make sure that the clothing and footwear you buy is the real McCoy and not a fashionable imitation. With regard to clothing in general, the layering system transfers sweat away from the body towards the outside. If you choose your clothing carefully , the material will not absorb the sweat and become wet, cold and uncomfortable.

Make sure you are equipped with at least one sturdy hat. If you are going into a cold environment you will want something along the lines of a balaclava or a hat that can be pulled down to cover the ears and neck. If it is going to be wet you will want something waterproof to supplement the hood of your jacket. In the desert it will be a good idea to follow the example of the Arabs and carry a keffiyeh, or Arab headdress, also known as a shemagh. If you cannot obtain the real thing, carry a piece of light cloth about 3ft 3ins (100cm) square that can be folded to cover the head, neck and shoulders, and wrapped round the face when necessary . These cloths can be obtained from survival shops. Jackets A good-quality , breathable jacket is a worthwhile investment. It will help to keep you dry and warm, not only by protecting you from rain but, if it is a breathable material such as Gore-T ex, by reducing the amount of body sweat. That will also help to reduce your water consumption, which is a priority in any climate. The jacket should have a deep hood with a wired peak, storm flaps and large adjustable pockets, to keep your hands warm. Pullovers A warm, dry pullover and/or fleece should be available to wear , for example, when you have stopped walking, and should be kept easily accessible in your backpack. Do not wear too much clothing when you are exerting yourself physically , otherwise you will not have anything warm and dry to put on when you need it. Shirts and t-shirts Shirts and t-shirts are widely available in materials that are both cool in hot climates and warm in cold ones. Once again, if you are not experienced in this area, or confused by the range of products, ask an expert. Pants You will want pants that are light and comfortable for walking. Another advantage of a light material such as cotton is that the pants will dry more quickly . As long as your upper body is warm, light pants are adequate even in cold, though not extreme, climates. Reinforced knee- covers are advisable. Y ou may also want to consider such features as spare pockets for maps, etc. In extreme climates you will need specialist pants, such as those designed for desert wear ."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"TIP: SURVIVAL PACK • Compass • Flint and steel firelighter (you may want to add a small cigarette lighter) • Windproof matches • Striker board • Candle (some versions are edible) • Magnifying glass • Flexible saw (and/or Swiss army knife equipped with saw) • Sewing thread (for a quiet evening by the fire) • Needles • Single-edged razor • Heliograph (for signalling) • Fishing gear • Wire snare • Cotton wool ball • Whistle • Water bag • Water purification tablets • Bag closures • Wound closures • Antiseptic • Plasters • Sunscreen/insect repellent • Safety pins • Electrolyte concentrate • Pencil • Notepad • Signal flares • Mess pack This is what a well-equipped soldier will carry in his backpack.

Y ou will want to pull waterproof pants over your boots. Socks Good walking socks are easy to find, and depending on the climate and the type of activity , you may want to wear two or more layers of socks. Make sure you have enough spare socks to be able to put on a dry pair when necessary . You will find socks classified under dif ferent categories, such as for walking and climbing. Some socks are impregnated with anti-bacterial agents to guard against infections. Gaiters These will be necessary in snow and generally help to protect the leather of the boots from damage. Boots There is a wide range of boots designed for dif ferent climates and uses. Do not just buy the toughest-looking pair , since they may not be suitable for the kind of activity you have in mind. A mountain boot, for example, will not be as flexible as a low-level walking boot. Get advice or read the reviews in specialist magazines. Ideally, boots should be broken in and adjusted to your feet before you use them in earnest. Consider how many layers of socks you will need to wear , and always try on boots in shops in the afternoon when your feet are warm and expanded. Insoles are an optional extra to consider . If you have leather boots, carry boot wax to keep them waterproof. The ideal boots will also have waterproof leather and may even have fabric linings such as Gore-T ex, Cordura and Cambrelle, which aid breathability , comfort, warmth and dryness. Backpack The backpack you select will depend on the amount of gear you have to carry and the range of your expedition. The principle of carrying a load on your back is that if it is high and close to your body , the weight will be directed more ef ficiently down to the ground, with the least amount of strain on your shoulders. The further the weight is behind you, the more it will pull back on your shoulders and create pain around the shoulders and neck."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Survival tin Remember to have items packed in such a way that quick changes of clothing, such as putting on a warm sweater or a dry pair of socks, can be performed without having to rummage around in the pack. Some packs are designed with brightly coloured interiors so that gear is less likely to get lost in a black hole! Military personnel often wrap items of gear , including boots, in waterproof bags to ensure they are kept dry . In doing this a soldier can even cross a river , using the back pack as a raft, without wetting any gear . You may want to attach such items as an ice axe; some packs will be fitted with straps and holders for the purpose. WEAPONS"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"If you are a servicemen you may be armed with a rifle or pistol, which will give you more options in hunting game, etc. If you are a civilian you will obviously be limited by the hunting and weapon-carrying regulations of the country you are visiting. Never try to enter a country without declaring a weapon, especially a firearm. You can carry something relatively light like a catapult that can be kept with your survival pack. Knives An effective knife will make life much easier and it can be used to perform a range of tasks. Y ou can carry a wooden-handled survival knife as well as a knife with a lockable blade. The knife can be used for chopping wood and skinning animals, among other uses. A blunt knife means more hard work and will consume your precious energy . Use a round stone with a rough and fine grain to sharpen the knife. Make sure the stone is wet. SURVIVAL PACK This is an easily portable pack which contains certain survival essentials that will help to keep you going in extremis. It can be stored in a pouch or a tin (see opposite), the advantage of a tin being that items can be more easily accessed, and the inside of the lid can double as a mirror . MEDICAL PACK The following is a guide to some basic items which may come in useful (see p16). Y ou may want to add or subtract items, or seek specialist medical advice, depending on the area you will be visiting and your state of health. Y ou can obtain commercially available packs adapted to the region you will be visiting, i.e. tropical, temperate, or desert."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"T 2 The desert is a place of extremes–extreme heat in the day and freezing temperatures during the night. In addition, there are the perils of blinding glare, sandstorms and, of course, little or no water. Survival in the Desert here are over 50 major deserts in the world, some of the best known of which are: the Arabian (500,000 square miles/1,290,000 square km); the Gobi in Mongolia (400,000 square miles/1,040,000 square km); the Kalahari in southern Africa (200,000 square miles/520,000 square km); the Libyan (650,000 square"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"miles/1,680,000 square km); the Mojave in California (15,000 square miles/38,850 square km); the Rub al-Khali, part of the Arabian Desert (250,000 square miles/650,000 square km); and the Sahara (three million square miles/ 7,770,000 square km). CLIMATE Deserts are characterised by less than 10ins (25.4cm) of annual rainfall, an evaporation rate that exceeds precipitation, and a high average temperature. No cultivation is possible and perennial plants are confined to watercourses or other places where water accumulates. High pressure gives sparse and irregular rain, clear skies, high temperatures, strong winds and intense evaporation. The little rain that falls is unpredictable – the central part of deserts can receive rain at any time. The lack of moisture in the soil and low humidity in the atmosphere means that most of the sunlight penetrates to the ground. Daytime temperatures can reach 131°F (55°C) in the shade, of which there is little. At night the desert floor radiates the heat back, causing temperatures to drop to near freezing. The temperature range can be as great as 86°F (30°C), and will vary considerably from one season to another . Frosts may occur during winter months. Your priority in the desert is to protect yourself from the sun, find water and avoid dangerous animals. Deserts"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"LAND AND WATER Since the desert soil is unprotected by vegetation, it is easily eroded by wind and water. Water rushing down from hills can form canyons and large slopes of debris. In turn, these slopes level of f to form low basins which fill with water when the rain comes. Desert terrain varies between mountainous, rocky , sandy , salt marsh and wadi. It is invariably dif ficult to traverse on foot, and native peoples do not go far in the desert without either a camel or some other means of transport. PERSONAL CLOTHING It is a good idea in any environment to follow the example, where possible, of the native people. In North Africa, for example, the Bedouin wear light-coloured, loose- fitting clothing (the hooded cloak is called a burnouse) in order to cover the head and neck to give protection against sun, wind and sand. The air trapped between the clothing and the body acts as extra insulation against heat. Even if traditional clothing is not worn, follow the same principles of protection and insulation. ‘Army uniform was abominable when camel-riding or when sitting about on the ground; and the Arab things, which I had learned to manage before the war, were cleaner and more decent in the desert.’ ( Seven Pillars of Wisdom , T.E. Lawrence) Maximum temperatures of desert areas Desert Temperature highs Sahara 130°F (54.4°C) Namib 88°F (31°C) Kalahari 110–115°F (43–46°C) Takla Makan 70°F (39°C) Gobi 113°F (45°C) Thar 122°F (50°C) Atacama 66°F (19°C) Points to note • Flash floods may run off the high ground without warning, and thus be life-threatenin g. This is likely to happen in rocky plateau deserts"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"such as the Golan Heights. • Sand dunes can be up to 1000ft (300m) high and 15 miles (24km) long. • Salt marshes should be avoided. They are flat areas where water has evaporated leaving an alkaline deposit. • Rain erodes sand into canyons and wadis, which can be difficul t to traverse easily . • Sandstorms are frequent and, apart from being extremely uncomfortable, they can also cause you to lose your bearings. • Mirages are refractions of light through heated air. The effect they have on objects makes it difficu lt to assess distances and identify objects clearly . FACE AND EYES A characteristic of the desert is the blinding glare: ‘The particles of sand were clean and polished, and they caught the blaze of sun like little diamonds in a reflection so fierce, that after a while I could not endure it. I frowned hard, and pulled the head- cloth forward in a peak over my eyes, and beneath them, too, like a beaver, trying to shut out the heat which rose in glassy waves off the ground, and beat up against my face.’ ( Seven Pillars of Wisdom , T.E. Lawrence) The headdress can be worn to protect the face and eyes by wrapping it round the face, leaving only a small slit for vision. Additional protection can be provided by sun- glasses or eye covers, improvised from suitable material such as cloth or even bark from a tree. Headdress"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"FEET The desert floor will be either intensely hot or intensely cold, which can cause blistering of the feet and cracking of the heels: ‘The sand was still very cold beneath our feet. Usually, when they are in the Sands during the winter or summer, Arabs wear socks knitted from coarse black hair. None of us owned these socks and our heels were already cracking from the cold. Later these cracks became deeper and very painful.’ ( Arabian Sands , Wilfred Thesiger) Do not attempt to walk barefoot, as it is unlikely that your feet will be hard enough. If you have shoes or boots, ensure that sand is kept out of them by binding cloth, bandage or other material over the top of the footwear and round the ankle. Check footwear regularly to ensure no sand is inside, as the sand will be abrasive on the feet. Also, check for scorpions and other dangerous animals when putting on footwear . If the footwear is inadequate (e.g. thin-soled) you might be able to improvise an extra layer of protection on the bottom of the shoe (e.g. a piece of rubber) or inside the shoe (e.g. a piece of felt) in order to reduce the heat. SHELTER The type of shelter you choose will depend largely on your circumstances and the material you have available. If you are near a crashed plane, for example, it is a good idea to build a shelter near the aircraft as rescuers will be able to spot it relatively easily. Do not shelter inside it in the desert sun as it is likely to be too hot. First consider the amount of time and energy you have. It is better to build a full shelter in the morning or evening and to improvise temporary shelter during the heat of the day . Site of shelter If you are near rocky outcrops or caves, these may provide suitable shelter , but beware of unwelcome insects, snakes and other animals that may also be sheltering there. Do not construct a shelter in a gully in case there are flash floods. Look out for indentations in the ground which can provide the basis for a shelter . TYPES OF SHELTER Rock outcrop with canvas or other material Stretch your canvas, poncho or other material from the top of the rocky outcrop to the ground, weighing down each end with stones, sand, etc. Site it in such a way as to"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"minimise the risk of rainwater flowing down the rock and into the shelter . Sandy area shelter Either use the side of an existing dune or build a mound of sand. Anchor your material with weights or plenty of sand on top of the sand bank and extend the material to be anchored at the lower end in the same way . For either kind of shelter , two layers of material are better than one. Allow a gap of about 16ins (40cm) between them and place some light-coloured material on the outside to reflect the sun’ s rays. Underground shelter This shelter will take more time and should therefore be constructed when the temperature is lower . Find a depression in the ground, a suitable area between rocks or dig a trench up to 25ins (60cm) deep. Make sure that you will be able to lie in the sunken area comfortably and store any equipment you may have. Place your material over the area. If you have dug a trench, pile the sand round three sides of it to anchor the material, allowing for adequate entry . If you have enough material, place a second layer over the first, with a gap of about 18ins (45cm). Underground shelter"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Shelter open on four sides Similar in principle to the underground shelter , this one is constructed in such a way that all sides are open, i.e. anchored at the four corners of the material. WATER In the desert, water definitely comes before food. If you have food but little or no water, eat sparingly until a fresh supply of water has been located, as the food you eat will increase the rate at which your body absorbs water . If water is available, work out a sensible ration. Then drink enough at least to clear the head, which will make it easier to plan how to locate other sources of water .

If you rest during the day and walk at night (travelling about 25 miles/40km), you should last two and a half days. Dehydration Even in a temperate climate, a minimum of 3¼US pints/2¾UK pints (1.5 litres) of water is lost by an adult every 24 hours through sweating, breathing and in urine. In a hot climate, as much as an extra 4¼–10¾US pints/3½–8¾UK pints (2–5 litres) of water may be lost, and up to 21¼US pints/ 17½UK pints (10 litres) if hard physical exertion is involved. When walking in a temperature of over 100°F (38°C), the sweat loss is 2 US pints/1¾UK pints (1 litre) per hour . Dry river bed"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Foods that are rich in fat require more water to break them down than foods that are rich in carbohydrate or starch and sugar . If you have had the chance to build a shelter , stay inside it during the hottest part of the day , as this will greatly reduce the rate of water loss. A Bushman of the Kalahari adopts the following method of finding water . He finds the deepest part of an old watercourse, then digs a hole in the sand to arm’ s length to find moist sand. He takes a tube almost 5ft (1.5m) long, made from the stem of a bush with a soft core, and winds 4ins (10cm) of dry grass lightly round one end. The Bushman then inserts the tube into the hole and packs the sand round it, stamping down the sand with his feet. He sucks on the tube hard for about two minutes, and eventually water comes into his mouth. It should be said that this skill may require a considerable amount of practice to master . Water can also be extracted from sand or mud by putting it in a cloth and wringing it out into a container . During the rainy season, ensure that any rain is caught. This can be done by staking out or suspending a piece of tarpaulin so that water flows to the centre."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Solar still Dew may form at night in the cooler months. Constructing a solar still is an ef fective way of catching dew (see opposite). PLANTS THAT PROVIDE WATER Cactus You can cut of f the top of a barrel cactus and extract water from the pulp by squeezing or mashing it. Do not eat the pulp, just suck out the juice. TIP: BUILDING A SOLAR STILL Materials required: 6ft-square (0.5m square) clear plastic sheet Container Drinking tube Rock First dig a round hole approximately 3ft (1m) across and about 2ft (0.6m) deep in an unshaded spot. Dig a further hole for the container at the bottom of the hole – the wider the container , the more water it will catch. Place one end of a tube in the container and pass the other end up to the"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"lip of the hole. Place the plastic sheet over the hole, covering the edges with soil to anchor it. The sheet should droop into the hole about 16ins (40cm), but should rest clear of the container . Put a fist-sized stone at the centre of the sheet, directly above the container . Make sure the sheeting does not touch the side of the hole, otherwise the earth will absorb the condensed water . Within 24 hours there should be at least 1US pint/ UK pint (0.5 litres) of water in the container , maybe about 2US pints/1¾UK pints (1 litre). The distillation makes the water safe to drink. Drink it through the tube. One still will not be enough for survival. Three or four are recommended if it is to be the main source of water . The upper surface of the still will catch rainwater , as a bonus. TIP: FINDING WATER Look for: • Valleys, gulleys and water courses. Water will normally collect at the lowest point, on the outside of a bend. • The movement of animals, birds and insects. Follow footprints and animal droppings if necessary . • Any signs of greenery , especially palm trees. • Clouds, rain and lightning in the distance – head in that direction. • The foot of cliffs or rock outcrops. Water may have collected in depressions or holes in the rocks. • Caves and fissures. Look for any signs of moisture or trickling water that may indicate larger supplies.

Look for mounds (formed of hardened animal excrement) that might mark a water hole. • Water sources sometimes covered by drifted sand in rocky areas. Dig in the areas where water is likely to have collected. • If you find salty water which looks unpalatable, find the spring where the water will be fresher .

When looking for animals, keep an eye out for obvious signs such as droppings, tracks, trails and feeding areas. AILMENTS Heat cramps Caused by excessive loss of salt through sweating, cramps normally occur in muscles that are being used, e.g. abdomen, arms and legs. The symptoms are shallow breathing, vomiting and dizziness. Move the patient into shade and provide water with salt dissolved in it (2 tablets per 2US pints/1¾UK pints/1 litre of water). Heat exhaustion This is characterised by fatigue, dizziness or nausea due to long exposure to heat; the body may have a temperature below normal and there is persistent sweating. The skin is moist and clammy , the pulse weak. First aid involves cooling the person and providing small sips of water . Heat exhaustion can be accompanied by cramps of the extremities, which should be treated by local massage. Heatstroke Humans will die after losing 12–13 per cent of their weight as body water . When the body dries out, the blood becomes more viscous and cannot circulate around the body adequately . Death from heatstroke occurs when the blood is no longer able to transport the metabolic heat from inside the body to the skin. Symptoms are: hot, dry skin; no sweat; flushing of the face and feverishness; raised temperature with rapid, strong pulse; severe headache and often vomiting. The victim may become unconscious. The body temperature must be lowered as soon as possible. Lay the victim in the shade, with the head and shoulders slightly raised. Remove outer clothing, wet inner clothing and fan the patient. If no water is available, dig a trench in the sand and place the victim in the bottom. When the patient is conscious again, provide water with salt added (2 tablets per 2US pints/1¾UK pints/1 litre of water). First aid must be immediate (see Chapter 6, Survival in Mountains), and the temperature must be brought down to below 102°F (39°C). This can be done by rubbing the victim’ s skin with cold water or alcohol. Sunburn"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Sunburn can be dangerous if the victim is overexposed. Make sure the body is adequately protected against the heat of the sun. T reat using sunbathing/ rehydrating cream. Sore eyes Soreness can be caused by a mixture of glare and exposure to flying sand. T reat the eyes with boracic ointment and bandage lightly . If no ointment is available, apply a damp bandage. All desert cuts and sores should be treated with antiseptic ointment as soon as possible. NAVIGATION Setting course The desert nights will normally be clear , allowing identification of the Southern Cross, which indicates true south. Once a course has been set, direction should be maintained by your compass. Without a compass, desert navigation is problematic, since there are few features to follow. One method of navigating is to follow objects in direct line with each other , and as far apart as possible. Before one object is reached, a third should be chosen in direct line with the second, and so on. Assessment of distances Another dif ficulty in the desert can be assessing distances. The clear atmosphere makes objects appear closer than they really are. As a rough guide to correction, multiply by three the visual estimation of distance. It will also be necessary to use a more accurate method of determining distance. Pacing A proven method of estimating a distance is to measure it through the number of paces taken. The average stride of a man is 2ft 6ins (0.75m), which is 25ft (7.5m), every 10 steps. It is useful to know the length of your own stride, and to practise measuring distances in this way , before embarking on an expedition. Timing Another method of estimating distance is by using a watch, working on the knowledge that the average person walks about 2½ miles (4km) per hour . Take care to adjust for difficult terrain, such as deep sand."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"You could also combine the two above methods to double-check.

If abandoning a ship or aircraft, take whatever warm clothing is available as well as easily portable food (chocolate and sweets). Do not jump into the water with an inflated life jacket, as the impact may be dangerous. IN THE WATER Once in the water , swim steadily and look out for any floating objects, such as pieces of wood, that will help you to keep afloat. If available, use a life raft. If you are escaping from a ditched aircraft, swim or paddle upwind, especially if the plane is on fire. Remember , any large object, such as a plane or boat, will create a suction when it sinks beneath the surface which can drag survivors down. Therefore, get away from the plane or boat as soon as possible. If you are the victim of a boat or plane crash and find yourself stranded at sea, you should use a life raft or whatever improvised flotation device you can locate. If there is burning oil on the water , attempt to swim under it, using underwater breaststroke (you may need to deflate or discard your life jacket). When you need to come up for air , allow enough time to clear a space in the burning area by pushing the water aside from beneath the surface. Then take in enough breath and, if possible, look to check the shortest route to clear water before submerging again, straight downwards, feet first. Once clear of immediate danger , practise relaxing by floating on your back with your face above the water . This will allow you to recoup energy before swimming again to the nearest life raft or large floating object. If no life raft is available, but you are wearing a life jacket, adopt the Heat Escaping Lessing Posture (HELP) to conserve as much body warmth as possible.

HELP posture IN A LIFE RAFT The immediate priorities are rescue, protection from the elements and water to drink. Observe the following important checklist: • Administer first aid, giving priority to any wounded survivors. Include dry clothing where possible. • Check that any signalling equipment is ready to hand, which may include flares, emergency radio and flags. Conserve batteries of signalling equipment, i.e. use only when search aircraft or ships are in range. • Salvage any useful material that may be floating nearby (it can be tied securely to the dinghy to allow more space inside)."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"• Ensure that one member of the crew is attached to the life raft with a line, in case it tips over and is blown away. • Institute water rationing immediately. • Check for desalting equipment and solar stills. • Check supplies of food. • Follow life raft instructions, such as inflating the floor, putting out a drogue to reduce drift, and closing any sea curtains in the direction of the prevailing wind. • Paddle towards other dinghies and attach a line of about 25ft (8m). • Remove wet clothing when appropriate, and dry out. Consider fashioning alternative clothing out of other materials, such as parachute cloth. • In a cold climate, huddle together to share warmth. • In a hot climate, keep at least one layer of clothing on to protect the body from direct and reflected sunlight. Life raft and contents RESCUE"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"The priority is to be seen or find safety such as a landfall. Y our chances of being found are greatest if you are close to the area where rescuers were last in radio contact. Stay in the area for at least 72 hours to give them a chance to locate you. The following actions will maximise your chances of being rescued: • Put out a sea anchor in order to stay close to the site. When open, the anchor will help to keep the dinghy in one vicinity. When closed, it will cause the life raft to be pulled along by the current. • Signalling and navigation equipment should be carefully protected from the elements, but easily accessible if they need to be used quickly. • Exercise leadership skills where necessary and allocate tasks (e.g. signaller, navigator, spotter and fisherman). Try to find out who has any specialist skills that might be useful. If you are not the leader, concentrate on carrying out your particular duty effectively and consider the best ways you can do so. Do not interfere with other people’s tasks unless asked. • You will be thinking most clearly in the early stages when you are reasonably well fed and watered, so make plans then that you can remember and follow if things become difficult and you become weaker. • Put up any permanent signals, such as a flag. • Work out the best way of using the signalling equipment available in the life raft, following instructions (see also Chapter 11, Navigation and Signalling). • Keep a log, which records the prevailing winds, weather, currents and state of the crew on board. This will help in such matters as navigation. FINDING LAND If rescue has not come or if, for any reason, you consider this to be unlikely (it may be that you are too far out to sea), then attempting to move towards land may be your best option. The life raft will be moved by a mixture of water current and wind. If the raft is low in the water , the ef fect of the current will be maximised. If it is high in the water and travelling light, the wind ef fect will be proportionately greater . Assess which is the most efficient way of making progress. If there is a high wind, it is probably a good idea to bring in the drogue and throw out unnecessary ballast. Signalling with a mirror"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Improvising Indications of land • A stationary cumulus cloud is often an indication of the presence of an island. • Birds will often be heading towards land in the afternoon and evening. Look out for the particular types of bird and the direction they are flying. If it is the morning, they will most likely be heading away from land, out to sea. • A lagoon can create a reflection greenish in colour on the underside of clouds. • Floating vegetation and pieces of timber may indicate the proximity of land. An excerpt from The Kon-T iki Expedition , by Thor Heyerdahl, illustrates the possibilities of finding land: ‘With each day that passed, larger flocks of sea birds came and circled over us aimlessly in all directions. One evening, when the sun was about to sink into the sea, we perceived clearly that the birds had received a violent impetus. They were flying away in a westerly direction without paying any attention to us or the flying fish beneath them. And from the masthead we could see that as they came over they all flew straight on exactly the same course. Perhaps they saw something"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"from up above which we did not see. Perhaps they were flying by instinct. In any case they were flying with a plan, straight home to the nearest island, their breeding-place. We twisted the steering oar and set our course exactly in the direction in which the birds had disappeared. Even after it was dark we heard the cries of stragglers flying over us against the starry sky on exactly the same course as that which we were now following. It was a wonderful night; the moon was nearly full for the third time in the course of the Kon-Tiki’s voyage . Next day there were still more birds over us, but we did not need to wait for them to show us our way again in the evening. This time we had detected a curious stationary cloud above the horizon. The lonely cloud on the horizon to the south-west did not move; it just rose like a motionless column of smoke while the trade wind clouds drifted by. Cumulonimbus is the Latin name for such clouds. The Polynesians did not know this, but they did know that under such clouds land lay. For when the tropical sun bakes the hot sand, a stream of warm air is created which rises up and causes its vapour content to condense up in the colderstrata of air.’ (Chapter VI, ‘Across the Pacific II’) MAKING A LANDING Signal if the land is likely to be inhabited and wait for rescuers to come out to you. If you have to make a landing, choose your position carefully , keeping clear of rocks or strong surf. Look for gaps in the surf line. Go round to the lee of the island, where you will be sheltered from the wind. Strong tidal currents may wash you back out to sea, so try to spot a sloping beach where the surf is less strong. You may be carried along parallel to the beach and some distance out to sea by a rip current, or rip tide. This is a surge of excess sea water escaping from the beach. Do not try to swim or paddle directly against the current. Swim or paddle along with the rip current for a short distance to allow its force to dissipate. Then head back in towards the shore. Beware of coral reefs in the Pacific – they will be dif ficult to see from low down in the water . Keep looking out for gaps. Do not get so close that you are sucked on to the reef. If you are negotiating a reef in a raft or dinghy , put out the sea anchor to pull the craft head on to the obstacle. Pull the sea anchor in when you judge the moment is right to take a wave over the reef. W ear shoes and hang on to the craft when going over coral or rocks. When coming in to beach, ride the crest of a large wave and remain in the life raft until it is grounded. Again, in The Kon-T iki Expedition , Thor Heyerdahl wrote: ‘We tied the longest rope we had to the home-made anchor and made it fast to the step of the port mast, so that the Kon-Tiki would go into the surf stern first when the anchor was thrown overboard. The anchor itself consisted of empty water cans filled with used wireless batteries and heavy scrap, and solid mangrove-wood sticks projected from it, set crosswise. Order number one, which came first and last, was: Hold on to the raft! Whatever happened we must hang on tight on board and let the nine great logs take the pressure from the reef. We ourselves had more than enough to do to withstand the weight of the water. If we jumped overboard we"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"should become helpless victims of the suction which would fling us in and out over the sharp corals.’ (Chapter VII, ‘To the South Sea Islands’) If you have to swim ashore, keep your clothing on and sit in the water with your feet up as protection against rock. DRINKING WATER The minimum requirement is 1US pint/¾UK pint (½ litre) a day , though, in some circumstances, a man or woman can live for about 10 days without water . Dos and don’ts include: • Do not drink for the first 24 hours, or until you developa headache. • In a hot climate, keep out of direct sunlight and dampen clothes during the day to keep cool, but do not over-wet or get water in the raft. • Keep physical exertion to a minimum, especially in the hottest parts of the day. • If you feel at all seasick, take whatever seasickness tablets are available. Being sick will result in a heavy loss of water. • Do not be tempted to use sea water for drinking or for mixing with fresh water. It is likely to cause vomiting. • Alcohol will exacerbate the water deficiency, so do not drink it. • If there is insufficient water, do not eat, because the food will absorb water from your body. In a hot climate especially, food is secondary to water. • Look out for rain and make sure you catch it in a tarpaulin and/or other containers. Store as much as possible and drink as much as possible in a steady way so as to avoid vomiting. Allow the body to absorb the water rather than over-filling your stomach. Moisten your lips and mouth before swallowing water. SOLAR STILL A life raft may be supplied with a solar still. Read the instructions carefully as the still will not work unless the sea is calm. ICEBERGS Old sea ice will have lost much of its saltiness, but new ice will be unpalatable. Old ice can be recognised by its smooth shapes and bluey tinge. Do not approach any berg that is likely to crush the life raft or overturn it suddenly . FINDING FOOD It is advisable to eat nothing for as long as possible. Carbohydrate-rich foods, such as chocolate, if available, could be eaten to of fset hunger when water is scarce. Fish are the obvious source of food, but remember not to eat too much with little water. Fish and seaweed are high in protein, and foods of this type require a"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"comparatively larger amount of body water to digest. Of fshore fish are usually safe to eat, whereas inshore fish can be poisonous. Catching fish • Protect your hands when holding a fishing line, as well as when holding a fish. • Use small fish as bait (rig up a net to catch them). They can also be used as food. • Cut loose any over-large fish and do not fish if sharks may be near. • Head for large shoals of fish but remember that shark and barracuda may also be present. • Take care not to puncture the dinghy with fish hooks, etc. • Fish should be gutted immediately after catching them (see Chapter 10, Trapping, Fishing and Plant Food). Any fish that you will not be eating immediately can be dried in the sun. But do make sure that you have enough water if you are going to eat dried fish. • In addition to a fishing line, you can also bind a knife to an oar to use as a spear to catch larger fish, though be cautious with regard to the size of the dinghy and a possible capsize or anyother damage. Birds All sea birds are edible. They are best caught either with a diamond-shaped gorge, covered in fish, which can be trailed behind the boat and which gets stuck in their throat or by a noose, similarly camouflaged, with which you may be able to trap their legs. Seaweed This should only be eaten if it is firm to the touch and odourless. Do not eat slender , branched varieties of seaweed as they contain irritant acids. Make sure any small sea organisms that may be attached to the seaweed come of f before eating. DANGEROUS SEA LIFE Sharks Some sharks are deadly . Beware of all sharks and try to ensure that you do not draw their attention. Sharks can be found in every ocean and sea, and can sense movement as well as blood and other decaying matter , such as vomit. Dos and Don’ts: • Treat seasickness as soon as possible so as to avoid putting vomit in the water. If you do need to get rid of vomit, throw it as far away as possible behind the raft, so that the current sweeps it away. • Try to limit the amount of urine or defecation that goes into the water at any one time. • If you are cut or have been bitten, stem the bleeding as soon as possible. • If on a dinghy or raft, do not dangle your limbs under the water, and be cautious about underwater repairs of the craft. • Like most predators, sharks will normally attack an animal that is giving signals of weakness. So if under attack, shouting, slapping the water, kicking or rapping or poking the shark with a stick may be enough to persuade it to turn its attention elsewhere."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"• If there are other people in the water, huddle together facing outwards, and beat the water with strong regular strokes. The shark will sense the confidence of the movements. • Let your adrenalin fuel your anger and not your fear. NAVIGATION AT SEA If you are in a properly equipped life raft, it should contain navigation equipment with instructions. If you do not have the usual equipment, such as a compass or sextant, the following points may help: Sun rise method The sun rises in the east and sets in the west. If you are north of latitude 23.5°N, the sun will pass south of you. If you are south of latitude 23.5°S, the sun will pass north of you. If you are between these two latitudes, the sun’ s path varies according to the time of year . Use the table on p49 to estimate your position according to the direction in which the sun rises at certain times of year . Watch method Between sunrise and sunset, and north and south of the latitudes shown in the table – N at 60° and S at 30° S – you can gain a rough estimate of direction by using your watch. Aim the hour hand at the sun. The point half way between the hour hand and twelve o’clock will show the approximate direction of true south if you are in the northern hemisphere, and the approximate direction of true north if you are in the southern hemisphere. However , if you are in the tropics, i.e. between 23.5°N and 23.5°S, this method is unreliable. Stars The night stars are a reliable guide and have been used by navigators for thousands of years. The key navigational aid in the northern hemisphere involves Polaris (North Star), which stands over the North Pole. Polaris is part of a faint constellation known as Ursa Minor (Little Bear), or Little Dipper , and can be identified in the sky by following a line through the two brightest stars of the constellation known as Ursa Major (Great Bear), or Big Dipper (see Chapter 1 1, Navigation and Signalling ). Without a sextant and navigation tables you will only be able to get a very approximate idea of your latitude by measuring the angle of the North Star over the horizon. A five-degree margin of error in the angle could put you out by as much as 300 nautical miles."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"In the southern hemisphere a constellation known as the Southern Cross is used as a guide. The four brightest stars form a cross tilting to the side. Follow the axis of the two furthest apart and continue an imaginary line five times the length of this axis.

Winds At low levels, winds flow around regions of relatively low pressure (cyclones) and high pressure (anti-cyclones). W inds flow anti-clockwise around lows in the northern hemisphere, and clockwise in the southern hemisphere. W ind systems rotate in the opposite direction around the centres of high pressure. The Beaufort scale Lying approximately between latitudes 10°S and 10°N is an area of low pressure and hot air . This area is known as the Doldrums.

It is not a straight north– south flow because of deflection by the rotation of the earth. The corresponding wind in the southern hemisphere is called the south-east trade wind. In the middle latitudes, the winds are called the prevailing westerlies, though their direction can be af fected daily by a number of factors. During the summer , the land continents are areas of low pressure, attracting winds in from the colder oceans. In the winter , the continents have high pressure, and winds flow towards the warmer oceans. Local winds In the summer , in particular , the land is warmer than the sea during the day , but it is colder than the sea at night. Breezes thus flow from the sea into the land during the day, and flow out from the land towards the sea at night. This phenomenon occurs across a band of up to 30 miles (50km) width, over land and sea. Ocean currents The prevailing winds af fect the ocean currents, which are seen in the map opposite. Clouds Four main groups are categorised on the basis of height. 1. Cirrus Usually about 4 miles (6km) above the earth, cirrus clouds are composed of ice particles. They are feathery and elongated, and appear as bands. They are known as mare’s tails. These clouds can often indicate fine weather , but when they are accompanied by a regular north wind in cold climates, they sometimes precede a blizzard. Cirrostratus This fine veil of whitish clouds are darker than cirrus. When cirrostratus follows cirrus across the sky , bad weather may follow . Cirrocumulus Small white balls arranged in groups, these clouds indicate good weather ."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"2. Cumulus Fluffy, white and heaped together , these clouds are often indicators of fine weather , and can appear around midday on a sunny day . If they pile up and push higher into the atmosphere they can become storm clouds. 3. Nimbus Clouds of uniform greyness extend over the whole sky . Cumulonimbus These clouds are dark with flat bases and rounded tops. Sometimes they form an anvil shape at the top, looking like cirrus. They often mean sudden heavy showers of rain, snow or hail. If a thunderstorm occurs, you can expect a strong wind from the direction of the storm as well as a rapid drop in temperature. Ocean currents 4. Stratus Low clouds composed of water droplets make up an even, grey layer of cloud. They inevitably mean rain or snow . Altostratus Holes in this layer mean that the weather may not be too bad.

T ypical rainforests occur in South and Central America, W est and Central Africa, Indonesia, South-East Asia, and in Australia."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"TROPICAL REGIONS Rainforest Temperatures are both even and high, with mean monthly temperatures between 75 and 82°F (24°–28°C). This is because the upper layers of tree canopies and lower layers of branches filter sunlight and reduce wind. The forest normally has three layers of tree crowns: the highest forms the forest canopy; below this is a layer of young trees, shrubs, large herbs and lianas; and a third layer , of tree branches, twigs and foliage, lies just above ground level. The forest floor is clearer than is usually thought, with a layer ofhumus and fallen leaves. Humidityis very high near the forest floor,but more variable near the canopy . To be able to survive in the tropics, you need the know-how to build shelter , the means of gathering rainwater for drinking and the knowledge to identify edible plants . There are mountainous regions in all major areas of rainforest and increases in altitude are matched by increases in rainfall. Primary and secondary jungle Primary jungle is typified by tall trees and layers of vegetation below , as described above. Secondary jungle results from the clearance of primary jungle for cultivation by man. The jungle eventually reclaims an abandoned cultivated area, but instead of tall trees there is a mixture of dense undergrowth and creepers, making this kind of jungle more dif ficult to cross. Monsoon forest Also called dry , or tropical deciduous, forest, the monsoon forest has trees that shed their leaves in the dry season. This type of forest is most evident in South-East Asia and is characterised by teak trees and bamboo thickets. Savanna Savanna is found in tropical regions around 8° to 20° from the equator . Mean annual precipitation is somewhere in the region of 31–59ins (800–1500mm), and rain falls in about October to March in the southern hemisphere and April to September in the northern. Mean monthly temperatures are between 50°F (10°C) and 68°F (20°C) in the dry season; 68°F (20°C) and 86°F (30°C) in the wet season."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Tropical rainforests Savanna is characterised by continuous grass cover , but it can vary according to the density of trees and shrubs.

Mangrove swamps Mangroves develop in both tropical and sub-tropical regions, and can be found in the river deltas of the Amazon, Mekong, Congo and Ganges. Many of the animals that populate these areas are dangerous or unpleasant, such as leeches, stinging insects, crocodiles and caimans. Freshwater swamps Found inland, freshwater swamps are mostly near rivers that supply the water for them. The water flows slowly through the abundant vegetation, and these areas are difficult to navigate. T ropical swamps include sedges, such as papyrus, as well as trees such as palms. Savanna"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"PERSONAL CLOTHING An environment with close, often thorny , vegetation and a vast range of insects as well as leeches demands strong clothing. Thick trousers and strong shirts are recommended, as well as plenty of clean changes of socks. W eight considerations may mean it is not possible to take more than two changes of clothing (not including socks), in which case it is advisable to keep one dry set sealed up in waterproof bags to change into at the end of journeys and for night wear . Due to the humidity , clothes are unlikely to dry soon enough, so it is better to change back into the wet kit for the next journey . There is a wide range of strong, specially adapted jungle boots on the market. As in desert environments, it is crucially important to check footwear and other clothing for insects before putting them on. Powder your body with zinc talcum powder and use insect repellent on your body and socks to keep leeches, mosquitoes and a host of other undesirable creatures at bay . SHELTER In tropical regions it is important to be aware of the possibility of flooding, so find high ground and/or an area where there is no evidence of previous flooding, such as silt. Make sure there is no dead wood above or immediately around you, as this could fall in a storm and cause severe injury . Termites are one sign of dead wood. Also keep away from coconuts or any other large objects that may fall. Clear away dead and rotting vegetation to make the site less attractive to insects and poisonous snakes.

Platform shelters These can be made from wood or bamboo lashed together . Bamboo can be split down the sides to create interlocking sections to be used as a bed and/or a roof. Large leaves such as palm and atap can be woven together to create a roof and walls for the shelter as well as bedding. T ake care when handling bamboo, as it can split suddenly when cut and send out sharp splinters. Leaves can be razor sharp and can inflict painful cuts if not handled carefully . Platform shelters Swamp bed This should be constructed in such a manner as to keep you out of harm’ s way in a swamp. Either find four trees in a rectangle or drive four poles into the ground. Then lash some cross poles across at both ends. Poles should then be laid along the long sides, resting on top of the crosswise short poles.

Cut of f the top and let the water drip into a receptacle during the night. (see p69) Coconuts Green, unripe coconuts have a refreshing milk which is a good substitute for fresh water. Do not drink from ripe or fallen coconuts. TIP: Water purification The best ways of purifying suspect water are: • Boil it for at least three minutes. • Use water-sterilising tablets. • Use two or three drops of iodine to 2US pints/1¾UK Pints (1 litre) of water, allowing it to stand for 30 minutes. • Use a few grains of permanganate of potash (a form of salt derived from permanganic acid) to 2US pints/1¾UK Pints (1 litre) of water and allow it to stand for 30 minutes. If you are taking water from a stream, don’t drink it directly from the surface but use a receptacle so as to check that the water is free from such things as leeches. Muddy water can be strained through a sand-filled cloth or a bamboo pipe filled with leaves and/or grass. The following sources of water will most probably require purification: • Stagnant water , such as small pools or water in tree trunks. • Water holes and large rivers. The water should be strained, allowed to stand for a few hours, strained again, and then purified by boiling or dissolving sterilising tablets. • Water from digging.

Mark out a rectangle in the snow . Cut out snow blocks just over 4ft (1m) deep from the marked-out area. Cut an L-shaped step 6ins (15cm) deep and 6ins (15cm) wide along the top edges and sides of the trench. Lean two blocks together at the opposite end from the entrance to start forming the roof. Make sure they are of fset, i.e. with one of the snowblock’ s edges extending beyond the other , so that the next block can be laid in place and supported. Cover each end with a block and dig a burrow-like hole at one end for an entrance. Alternatively , lay the side blocks upright with roof blocks placed horizontally across. Igloo or snow house"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"(See p98.) This requires some skill and practice, and you will also need a snow saw or adequate knife to do the job. Draw a circle of 8–10ft (2.5–3m) diameter in the snow to mark the inside of the igloo. Cut snow blocks from a nearby trench. When you have 12 blocks you can start building. Place blocks in a circular row with the side faces of each block angled to the centre of the igloo, and the tops of the blocks sloping inwards. Shave the tops of this row of blocks in a sloping angle to form the first rung of a spiral. Start the next row of blocks, cutting the blocks in such a way as to make the igloo curve inwards. When placing the key block, the hole should be longer than it is wide so that the block can be passed up through the hole and allowed to settle back into position. Pour powdery snow over the structure to seal any gaps. The Inuit sometimes insert a clear sheet of ice as a window . Inside the igloo cut a subterranean entrance, a sleeping level and a cooking level. You will need insulation on the sleeping level. Place sleeping bags so that the head is nearest the entrance. Use a snow block for the door , which should be left open during the day . Remember to insert ventilation holes. Inuit igloo Insert a clear piece of ice or a piece of seal intestine as a window . Have a flap of seal skin near the entrance to help keep the wind out. Cover the bedding area with willow twigs topped with animal furs. Lean-to shelter You can sling a horizontal bar between two trees or uprights and lean branches or boughs down the back for shelter , allowing enough space to lie inside with equipment. You can cover the roof with sod blocks, which should be arranged like tiles to allow water to run of f. You can build snow up on the sides where appropriate to provide extra insulation.

Willow-frame shelter This involves constructing a frame from willows, which can be either upright or elongated. The framework can then be covered with parachute material or with branches, overlaid with sods of soil and snow . Moulded dome shelter This shelter requires less expertise and time to construct than, for example, an igloo. Fill a poncho or other large piece of material with bark and small boughs. Cover the material with snow , leaving a gap for the entrance. When the snow has hardened, remove the material and contents, thus creating a living space.

T o make a fire, you will need to construct the right kind of base and also find kindling and fuel. Do not build the fire under a snow-covered tree or near anything that is likely to put it out. The fire should be constructed on a firm platform which you can make out of green wood logs, or stones. Failing that, you can dig down to firm soil. If you want to cook, construct a frame to concentrate the heat and to hang a pot on. If you want to heat a shelter , construct a reflector . Fuel Pick up kindling during the day wherever you can find it. Dead trees are best for fuel, though birch will burn if split, and green wood will burn on a hot fire. Cassiope is a plant used by Eskimos for fuel when there is no other wood. Other fuels can be peat, animal dung and dry grass twisted together . Lighting the fire Make sure everything is easily to hand before attempting to light the fire. If you have matches, use one to light a candle or a bundle of sticks with which you can then light the fire. When kindling is lit, gradually add the fuel, without packing it too densely . Blow on the fire if necessary .

Symptoms Urine is a thick yellow colour , and a headache is developing. T reatment Ensure that you drink enough water to restore the balance. Y ou should know that you are all right, and that the water has filled your cells, when your urine is clearer and your head feels clearer too.Allowing yourself to become dehydrated will af fect your ability to think and plan. Prevention Make sure you drink an adequate amount of water every day , and do not allow yourself to sweat excessively . Adjust your clothing accordingly . Hypothermia This means that the body temperature is below normal. Symptoms Lowered resistance to cold, excessive shivering and sluggish movement and thinking. T reatment Return the body to normal temperature as soon as possible. Ideally this should be by immersion of only the torso in warm water (100° to 1 10°F/37.7° to 43.3°C). Care should be taken with this treatment, as total immersion in warm water couldresult in shock and cardiac arrest. In a survival environment, the most likely cure is to wrap the patient in a sleeping bag with someone who is warm. Ideally , both should be naked. Do not delay too long, and if the person is conscious start to give him/her hot, sweetened fluids. It is not enough simply to remove the patient from the source of heat after the body temperature has returned to normal, as the patient is apt to revert to a low temperature once he/she is removed from the source of heat. Allow the patient to regain a reserve of body heat by keeping him/her warm and administering hot drinks as necessary . Prevention"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Do not allow yourself or others to undergo continuous periods of cold without food, hot drinks or other sources of warmth, and beware the danger of getting wet, especially in a wind. If you fall into water in polar regions: • Swim violently and rapidly towards land. • Roll yourself in snow, which will absorb some of the water. • Get yourself to a shelter and warmth as fast as possible. • Brush off loose snow before entering the shelter. • Dry your clothing and take hot drinks and food. Frostbite Symptoms This is a serious injury to the skin and sometimes other body tissues by freezing or by formation of ice crystals in the tissue cells. It usually occurs when the temperature is below 10°F (12°C) but can occur at around 32°F (0°C) when there is a windchill factor or when the patient has got wet. Since the cold has an anaesthetic ef fect, frostbite may not be immediately noticed by the person concerned. Frostbite normally af fects those parts of the body that have the least protection, such as the face, nose, ears, hands and feet. The first signs are a dull whitish colour in the skin, then the formation of blisters, followed by the death of some skin cells and underlying tissue. T reatment • Warm up the affected area and ensure it does not freeze again. • Put affected hands inside clothing near the body. • Place frostbitten feet inside a companion’s clothing. • Do not burst blisters but dust them with antiseptic powder. • Cover the affected area with surgical dressing or some other clean material. • Do not dip the affected area into hot water or try to warm by a fire. Use body warmth instead. • Use morphia if there is too much pain. • Serious and deep cases of frostbite should be treated by trained medical personnel. Prevention • Do not wear tight clothing, which reduces circulation and increases the risk of frostbite. • Keep out of the wind as far as possible. • Do not go outside without adequate clothing. • Keep clothing dry. • Move extremities as far as possible, including the face by making expressions and exercising the facial muscles. • Do not touch cold metal with bare hands. • Take special care if you are tired and low in energy."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"• Do not allow yourself to be splashed with petrol on bare flesh. Trench foot Symptoms Long exposure to cold and wet can cause feet to turn pale, numb, cold and stif f. The feet will begin to swell, making walking painful.

Clean with soap and water , dry the feet and then keep them raised. Do not walk if you are suf fering from this condition. Put on dry socks and make sure there is always a spare, dry pair available to you. Prevention Keep footwear as dry as possible and change socks frequently . Snow blindness This is caused by the intense glare of the sun, which is reflected of f the snow or intensified by ice crystals in clouds. Symptoms Sensitivity to glare. Pinkish vision and watering eyes. Intensifying of reddening vision and pain like grit in the eyes. Loss of vision behind painful, red curtain and sharp pain. T reatment Urgently place bandage over the eyes and/or place the patient in a dark place. A cool, wet bandage may help relieve the pain. T ime is required for the eyes to recover . Prevention Wear sunglasses. If sunglasses are not available, improvise eye shades by cutting slits in bark or some other material and placing them over the eyes. Rubbing charcoal into the skin around the eyes will help to reduce glare. Carbon monoxide poisoning This is particularly dangerous in extreme cold climates because shelters are likely to be small and well sealed against the elements, increasing the risk of insuf ficient ventilation.

Prevention Keep all shelters well ventilated, which means having at least two ventilation holes to allow circulation. Do not let fires burn up too high. T urn off all stoves and lamps before going to sleep. FINDING WATER There is no lack of water in polar regions, but the quantity of water obtained from snow and ice will depend on the amount of fuel available to melt it. It is preferable to melt ice rather than snow , as the volume of water will be greater . You should not sacrifice water intake to save fuel as this will eventually lead to serious side-ef fects. You should aim to limit the amount of water lost through sweat by loosening or removing clothing when you are working. In the summer , water can be obtained from streams, lakes and ponds. In tundra regions the water may be stained brown by vegetation, but it is still fit to drink. Despite the fact that water in polar regions is, comparatively , cleaner than in other regions of the world, you should still purify water before you drink it and, if necessary , strain it. In winter you can obtain water most easily from lakes under the ice and snow . Since the lower surface of the ice follows the contours of the surface of the snow above it, you should dig where the snow is deepest and then chip through the ice under this to find the least cold water . When heating snow , melt a little at a time and wait until it is fully melted before adding more. Otherwise, the unmelted snow will draw up the water and the pot will burn."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Old sea ice yields much better drinking water than young ice, which will still be salty . Old sea ice will be rounded and have a bluish tinge. Do not fill your water bottle right to the top with water – you need to allow some movement in the water to prevent it freezing again. Also, keep the water bottle close to your body . FINDING FOOD Ideally, you should have at least two hot meals a day in an extremely cold environment, as well as an occasional hot drink. Food is not abundant in polar regions, though in summer months you should easily be able to obtain fish and other water life from coastal waters, streams, rivers and lakes. Y ou should easily be able to find clams, crawfish, mussels, snails, limpets, chitons, sea urchins and King Crab on most Arctic shores. Do not eat dead shellfish. The small black-purple mussel of the northern Pacific waters is poisonous and should be avoided. Do not eat fish that have sunken eyes, slimy gills, flabby flesh or skin, or an unpleasant smell. Do not eat any kind of jellyfish. Kelp and other smaller seaweed are edible, though you should avoid seaweed that has long filaments and tendrils. Ice fishing Ice may be as much as 12 feet (4m) thick, so you will need to choose an appropriate spot to create a borehole for fishing, where the ice is not too thick to make a hole but thick enough to bear your weight. Y ou can dangle a line on the end of a small stick with some form of signalling device attached to it, such as a handkerchief or piece of card. T ie this stick to another which is across the fishing hole. When a fish bites it should cause the pennant to spring up. (See Chapter 10, T rapping, Fishing and Plant Food, for further advice on fishing techniques.) LAND ANIMALS Polar bears are normally found near the coast and should be treated with extreme caution. Only tackle one if you have a good rifle as they are very dangerous animals. In spring, earless seals can be found basking on the ice near their breathing holes. They are extremely vigilant, however , and dif ficult to approach. Y ou are only likely to"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"be able to kill a seal with a clear shot to the brain, and preferably before it slides into the water , as it will be very dif ficult to retrieve.

TRAVEL The decision to travel when in a survival predicament should be based on the likelihood of reaching safety as opposed to rescuers being able to find you, especially if you are near a large object like a crash-landed plane. Other factors include the weather and your own physical condition. Y ou should not venture out in a blizzard or , if a blizzard is threatening, you need to be fully aware that travel will involve plenty of physical exertion and an increased amount of food and water. You will also need to be able to build temporary shelters en route. When crossing thin ice, lie flat and crawl so as to distribute your weight.

Mountain climbing is a specialist skill beyond the scope of this book, but what follows are some of the basic skills which will help you survive and reach safety in mountainous regions."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Mountains usually exist in ranges which consist of peaks, ridges and intermontane valleys. Although some mountains stand on their own, the smallest group is usually the range which can be made up of either a single ridge or a series of ridges. Closely related ridges are called mountain systems, and more than one system joined together is called a mountain chain. A mixture of ranges, systems and chains is called a belt or cordillera. CLIMATE Temperature falls at a more or less constant rate with increasing altitude – about 33– 34ºF (0.5–1°C) for every 328ft (100m). Wind systems are forced by mountains to rise and cool as they do so, causing higher precipitation on windward mountain slopes. When the wind descends the leeward slope, it warms up and precipitation reduces, creating rain shadow . If you are able to escape from the mountains, abseil or descend by another means. If not, build a snow cave and await rescue. Mountains in desert regions receive little rain because the air is so dry . On equatorial mountains, although temperatures are low at high altitudes, winter and summer are indistinguishable. There are rapid changes in temperatures, from about 28°F to 46°F (–2°C to 8°C).

After that, vegetation can be almost non-existent. PERSONAL CLOTHING AND EQUIPMENT Depending on how high you are up a mountain, you will either be cold or very cold. Having the right kind of clothing will make a big dif ference. Layers The layering system is not new; it is simply the case that the range of materials has substantially improved. Whereas early climbers were restricted to variations on wool and tweed, climbers today have a wide range of synthetic fibres from which to choose, most of which are available from local department stores. Base layer The idea of this is that a thin layer of, usually , synthetic material should transfer moisture from the skin away from the body , while being too thin to absorb moisture that may be coming in from outside. The result is that you should always remain reasonably dry despite the level of exertion or outside conditions. Insulating layer The latest and most ef fective insulating material is fleece, which has developed from being the preserve of the cognoscenti to a ubiquitous fashion item. It is worth taking care when choosing a fleece, as there are dif ferent thicknesses and some have breathable material inserted. There are other factors to consider , such as ventilation zippers and stretch fleeces. As in most cases, apart from rainforest wear , thin trousers are ideal for walking since they allow ease of movement and dry easily . Obviously , warmer over-trousers, such as Mountain Equipment Ultrafleece, should be worn in extreme cold. Shell layer Ideally this should be a breathable fabric such as Gore-T ex. For mountains, a three- ply layer is recommended. Other variations can be considered, such as Patagonia H2NO. If you are mountaineering, you will want to ensure that the clothing you buy is adaptable to the activity and to the extra equipment you may be wearing, such as a"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"helmet. Over-trousers should be designed in such a way – perhaps with articulated knees – as to allow ease of movement. Single-layer system This is a cheaper option, perhaps for those who do not wish to invest so much time and money in a particular outdoor activity . The emphasis is on breathability and the transfer of moisture away from the body . All the above garments will function much better if they are kept clean and properly maintained. Boots There is a huge variety of boots available on the market, most of which are good. It is important to remember , however , that boots are built in dif ferent ways according to the type of conditions or environment that they are to be used in and should be selected with care. Obtain specialist advice on boots from an expert in a reputable, outdoor equipment shop (but always bear in mind that the salesman’ s job is to sell you something). Do your own research through magazines, which sometimes carry special equipment surveys. The major grades of conditions for which you will require dif ferent boots are hillwalking, winter mountaineering and snow and ice-climbing. Boots that are flexible and ideal for hillwalking will not provide the stif fness and support required to negotiate snow without crampons. If you are planning to do winter or Alpine walking, therefore, wear stif f-soled boots with supportive uppers. Crampons can be added when necessary , and will be more ef fective on this kind of boot. Ice axe To move on snow and ice, this is a basic piece of equipment that can be used for support, braking, digging and probing. Its basic components are the head (adze and pick), a shaft and a spike. Ski stick This will make movement through snow easier . You can carry a telescopic ski stick in a backpack. MOUNTAIN HAZARDS Avalanche"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"While an avalanche can occur wherever snow lies, it is influenced by certain conditions. If the snow is well bound together , then the risk of avalanche is reduced. If there are marked dif ferences in the hardness of layers of snow , then the risk of avalanche increases. You can assess the likelihood of an avalanche by digging into the snow in a representative area to test the hardness. If you prod the snow with an axe shaft and notice sudden changes in resistance, that is quite a good sign that the area is prone to avalanche. Y ou can perform the test more thoroughly by digging a snow profile, preferably all the way to the ground, which will allow you to assess dif ferences in hardness, moisture content and crystal size in the various layers of snow . Avalanche risk Water is a lubricant, so if the snow is very wet it will be denser and heavier , and more likely to slide. A rough guide to the wetness of snow is that if you can make a snowball out of the snow , it is quite wet. If your gloves are dripping wet from handling the snow , it is very wet. Ground If the ground is hard and smooth, then snow is more likely to slide over it. Long grass will also provide a slippery surface for snow . Slope"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"If the slope is concave, it is less likely to have an avalanche. If it is convex, it is more likely to have an avalanche. Obviously , the angle of the slope is also an important factor. The steeper the slope, the more likely the snow is to slide of f it. Slopes of between 20° and 50° are most likely to have an avalanche. W ind slab The most common type of avalanche is called wind slab, and is caused by the ef fect of wind on falling or fallen snow . Wind slab snow is chalky in appearance, has a fine texture and makes a squeaky noise when walked on. Powder snow Avalanches can be caused when powdery snow accumulates in conditions of no or little wind. Over 1ft 4ins (40cm) of fresh snow is an indicator of a high risk of this kind of avalanche. Ice Avalanches caused by ice usually occur in warm weather when ice masses fall after thawing. Pinnacles of ice, or seracs, are most likely to fall in the morning or evening, due to the change in temperature. W et snow A rapid rise in temperature or an area exposed to direct sunlight implies the risk of a wet snow avalanche. See if there are snowballs running down a hill, which is an indicator of this kind of avalanche. What to do in areas at risk of avalanche • Cross a danger zone one at a time, connected by a rope. • Cross the slope as high as possible. • Take advantage of any available protection, such as rock outcrops. • If you are caught in an avalanche, do your best to maintain your present position. This may mean digging your axe into an area of snow above you that is not moving. By staying where you are, you will allow the dangerous snow to pass safely below you. • If you are falling in an avalanche, try to move across to the side of the fall by rolling sideways. Use swimming motions to try to remain near the surface. If still caught in the avalanche when it has stopped, use all your energy to ‘swim’ to the surface. • If you are buried, try to clear a breathing space as soon as possible in front of the face. • Conserve oxygen by not shouting, which is unlikely to be heard anyway. Rescue If you see someone taken by an avalanche: • Mark the spot where you saw him/her before the avalanche fell, and then the place where the avalanche hit the person. Follow the line through these two points and continue it below to find the most likely place of burial."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Rescue search • Call for help, but do not leave the area to find assistance that is more than 15 minutes away. • Look for anything like personal items that may indicate where the burial site is. • Systematically check the area by probing with an axe shaft or other means. • On finding the victim, clear the mouth and airways. Remove the weight of snow from the chest. Give artificial respiration immediately if the person is not breathing, even before fully removing the body from the snow. Cornice These are overhanging masses of snow which usually form on the crests of ridges and plateaus, but which can occur at any sharp changes of angle. The most common angle of slope on which a cornice forms is 17°. A cornice can break of f well back from the actual edge, so keep as far away from the edge as possible. It is advisable to be roped up when you are negotiating a ridge with a cornice. Glacier"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"A glacier is a mass of ice in an area of permanent snow . The weight of snow creates a pressure that turns snow to ice, which then begins to move downhill under the force of gravity. As the glacier moves, it melts, and only stops moving when the amount that has melted is equivalent to the accumulation of snow at the source of the glacier . The surface of the glacier is a brittle crust which can crack under the strains of glacial movement to form features such as crevasses, ice falls, seracs, etc., all of which constitute dangers for mountaineers. The glacier picks up crushed rock, which is known as moraine. The rock may then be deposited in ridges along the side (lateral moraine), along the centre (medial moraine) and at the end of the glacier (terminal moraine). Mor-aines can be loose and dangerous to traverse. Moving on glaciers • Take special care in areas where the glacier starts to become steeper or where it bends, as this will create dangerous features. • Take care with snow bridges (which cross crevasses) as they might give way at any moment. • Try to cross a glacier in the early morning when it is still cold, before ice has turned to meltwater. • If the glacier is covered with fresh snow, features like crevasses will be difficult to see and, therefore, climbers should be roped up to each other. It is much safer to be roped up whatever the conditions. Diagonal ascent"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"• Temperatures may be high on the glacier during the day, but climbers should take care about how much clothing they remove because, if they fall into a crevasse, the temperature will plummet quickly. When roped up, allow about 82ft (25m) of rope between at least two, and preferably three or more, people. Some rope can be coiled round the body , over the right shoulder and under the left arm, to make a distance between walkers of about 50ft (15m). An overhand knot should be tied round the coils and the main rope. Loose coils of rope should never be carried, and the rope should never be slack between the climbers. If the first man falls into a crevasse, the rest of the team should quickly move backwards and down on their haunches, with their heels dug into the snow to stop the fall. Approach a crevasse at right angles, and if jumping one remember that snow may be loose on the far side. Make sure you fall forward after the jump, preferably with an ice axe to dig in at the other side. Keep an eye out for any abnormalities in the surface of the snow , such as dark patches or dips, which may be covering a crevasse."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"MOVING IN MOUNTAIN SNOW AND ICE You can kick steps when walking in snow , but on ice wear crampons (on the correct kind of stif f boots). Direct ascent Hold the ice axe with the pick pointing backwards and use it for support. Only move it when both feet are fully secure in steps. Kick a step into the snow , which is angled slightly downwards. The step should be deep enough to take at least half the foot, though this may not be possible in very hard ground. Diagonal ascent The steps should be horizontal, created with the side of the boot, and angled slightly into the hill. Kick along the slope to saw away the snow . Push the axe into the hill with the inside hand for stability and security . Descent This time the steps are made with the heel of the boot, with an almost stif f leg. Arresting a fall If you slip and you have an ice axe, immediately drive the shaft vertically into the slope and keep one hand holding it near the base. Kick both toes into the snow to get a foothold. On harder snow , the pick of the ice axe should be used, forcing it into the snow to create a brake. Braking position One hand should be on the head of the axe and the other on the shaft. If the left hand is on the axe head, the adze should be under the left shoulder , with the right hand on the shaft to the side of the body . The pick should be forced into the slope by pushing down with the right arm and shoulder . The adze of the axe should be pushed into the hollow just below the collar bone. Pressure should be on the axe and on the knees with feet raised. Braking positions"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Braking without an axe"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"The above is the basic position, but obviously you may not be in the ideal position when you fall. The important thing is to act as quickly and instinctively as possible. Practice with the guidance of a good climbing manual will make a considerable difference. Braking without an axe If you lose the axe in a fall or do not have one, use your arms, feet, hands and legs to break the fall. One technique is to roll on your front, push up from the slope with your arms and concentrate all the pressure on your toes. This has a wedge ef fect which should bring you to a halt. Glissading If you intend to glissade, you should be competent at ice-axe braking. Only glissade if you can see where you will stop. Standing glissade"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Like skiing, you should adopt a relaxed position with knees slightly bent and the feet apart. Hold out the arms for balance. T urn by moving the body , and stop by turning the feet across the slope. Crouching glissade Crouch down grasping the ice axe, with one hand on the top and the other on the shaft. Drag the spike of the axe in the snow for balance. T o brake, put your weight on the shaft of the axe. Sitting glissade Sit on the snow and slide down, using the axe in the same way as in the crouching glissade. If you lie back and raise your feet, you will go faster . To stop, put your feet down and use the axe. DESCENDING FROM A HILL OR MOUNTAIN Descent is your main priority , because on a mountain you will be both cold and exposed. If you need to rest and find temporary shelter , work your way round to the lee of the mountain, out of the wind. • Look out for worn paths or other signs that the route has been used by people, to make your descent easier. • In poor visibility, you will need to be extremely cautious, as finding your way in a mist is difficult even for experienced climbers with compasses. • If you are scrambling down a hillside, make sure you are facing inwards towards the rock. • Avoid gullies, as the risk of stone falls is greater. If you are in a group, ensure that those below are not in danger of being hit by rocks loosened by those above. • You should not have to use a rope on a hill; however it is always wise to carry a rope in case of real emergencies. • If traversing a glacier in a group, keep roped together. Follow existing tracks if possible, but be aware that they may have been left by inexperienced climbers. • Beware of slopes covered with small, loose stones (scree), as they may lead to a cliff which you cannot see from the top. Abseiling (See p127–28.) The following description of a classic abseil assumes you are only equipped with a rope. Abseiling is not an easy option and is treated with caution by even experienced climbers. Pictures of civilians abseiling of f buildings give a false impression – they are usually under strict guidance by experienced servicemen. Resort to abseiling only if there are no options, or if you or a companion are trained in the technique. How to abseil"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"First of all find a solid anchor; a second anchor point may be used as a backup. The anchor should ideally be located above the ledge on which you are standing. Make sure the rope will not move once it is under strain. Keep the rope clear of narrow cracks, which may prevent you retrieving it when you need to. Also, keep it clear of sharp edges that could cut into the rope. If it is necessary to do a long abseil you may need to join two ropes, in which case try a double fisherman’ s knot. A void loose rock or sharp edges in the area where the rope will run, as the rope may become severed. Make sure that long hair and loose clothing do not get caught up in the abseiling devices and ropes. Tie yourself and the top of the abseil rope to the anchor(s). If necessary – and to avoid abseiling of f the end of the rope – tie a knot in the bottom end of the abseil rope before throwing the rope down the clif f. Make absolutely sure that anyone below is aware of what you are doing, and that the rope reaches down as far as the ledge you are trying to reach. Pass the rope, from front to rear , between your legs, round your upper left thigh, diagonally across your chest, over your right shoulder , under your armpit and into your left hand. W alk slowly backwards over the edge, and crouch low if there is any danger of lifting the rope of f the top of the anchor .

Once down, if pulling the rope through, beware of any rock that may be loosened by the rope. Belaying First of all, find an anchor . This could be a spike of rock, a tree or a jammed stone. Make a loop in the main rope and place it over or around the anchor point. The securing loop is formed using a figure-of-eight knot.

Take a seated position, with feet firmly anchored. Make sure the rope between you and the anchor is taut. Y ou and the anchor should be in line with the direction of force. To stop a fall, bring the dead hand across the front of the body . Never take the dead hand of f the rope when the rope is being paid out or drawn in. The live hand, nearest the climber , should do this work. KNOTS Greater detail on knots is given in Chapter 13, Ropes and Knots, but below are a few knots that are useful for climbing. Overhand knot Probably the simplest of all knots. Double overhand knot This is the same as the overhand knot but the end is taken twice round the ropes before being fed through. Figure-of-eight A versatile climbing knot which is easy to tie and untie. The knot should not be tied with too short a tail, and if the tail is short, tie a stopper knot on the end of it. Bowline This is a good way of tying on to the rope. T ake care to tie it properly . Secure it with a stopper bound round the rope in the loop.

EARTHQUAKE Earthquakes are impossible to predict and can have a number of dif ferent classifications – tectonic, volcanic and artificially produced. No place on earth is free from the danger of an earthquake. Preparation and a calmness during crisis are the keys to surviving natural disasters such as tornadoes, earthquakes and floods.

HURRICANE A hurricane is a storm with winds of between 74 and 200mph (120 and 320km/h). Hurricanes have their source in equatorial waters, particularly the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. In the western Pacific Ocean they are known as typhoons and in the Indian Ocean and around Australia they are known as tropical cyclones."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Dangers The destructive power of a hurricane can be manifested in dif ferent ways, including wind power , tornadoes, rainfall and storm surges. The storm surge is the most dangerous aspect of the hurricane, accounting for 90 per cent of deaths. It is caused by changes in atmospheric pressure inside the hurricane sucking up the sea. Hurricane winds also pile up the water against the coastlines. The resulting wall of water can be up to 40ft (12m) high, though it diminishes as it heads inland. Fujita-Pearson tornado scale F–0: 40–72mph (64–115km/h) Chimney damage, tree branches broken F–1: 73–1 12mph (116–179km/h) Mobile homes overturned F–2: 113–157mph (180–251km/h) Considerable damage, mobile homes demolished,trees uprooted F–3: 158–205mph (252–328km/h) Roofs and walls torn down, trains overturned, cars thrown F–4: 206–260mp (329–416km/hh) Well constructed walls levelled F–5: 261–318mph (417–509km/h) Houses lifted off foundations and carried considerable distances; cars thrown as far as 100m (330ft) Forecast It is difficult to forecast a hurricane. Even meteorological of fices in developed countries can be caught with their guard down. Hurricanes tend to be more prolific in the Atlantic region in August and September . The source of the hurricane consists of warm water influenced by the Earth’ s rotation. The sea temperature must be at least 79°F (26°C). Hurricanes occur at least 4–5° polewards from the equator , and no closer .

If a hurricane is expected in less than 24 hours a Hurricane W arning is issued. During a hurricane watch, listen to a battery-powered radio for updates, and make preparations. Preparation • Board up windows in a building. Taping up windows will not help. • Trim any weak branches off trees that may be near houses. • Bring inside any objects, such as rubbish bins or garden chairs, that the wind could pick up. Action Inside • Shelter in the cellar or somewhere away from windows or the roof. A hurricane can rip off the roof. • Do not drop your guard when the calm eye of the storm passes over. The other side of the storm, with winds travelling in the opposite direction, will soon reach you. Outside • Find a cave, ditch or rocky outcrop to shelter in or under. • Be prepared to adjust your position when the eye of the storm has passed over. • Do not attempt to drive anywhere in a car in a hurricane. • Take care with bridges, which may be washed away. TORNADO Hurricanes can spawn tornadoes, which are much more unpredictable. The track of a tornado is erratic, and so all the more dangerous. A tornado will not give you time to plan and think. Be ready to act fast. A tornado looks like a grey spiral, funnel or elephant’ s trunk, and wind speeds can be anything from 300 to 350mph (480 to 560km/h). It is made visible by the dust that is sucked up by the winds and by condensed water droplets. The area of the tornado touching the ground is usually only a few hundred metres across, though it can be up to ½ mile (1km) wide. A tornado can cause a house to tear apart by creating higher pressure inside the house than outside it."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Preparation Find a cellar or tornado shelter in good time before the storm arrives. Remember , even if the tornado does not appear to be heading your way , it may suddenly change course. Action Inside • Shelter in the basement or lowest level of the building. • Stay in the centre of the room, away from corners and windows. • Shelter under strong furniture, such as a heavy table, and hold on tightly. • Protect your head and neck with your arms. Outside • Do not walk around outside as you could be plucked up by the wind or struck by heavy objects thrown by the wind. • Do not stay in a car, but get out and find the most solid shelter available to you. • Shelter in a ditch if necessary or under a sturdy rocky outcrop. LIGHTNING Lightning is a visible electrical discharge between clouds, or between a cloud and the Earth. More people in the developed world are killed by lightning than by any other natural phenomenon. It is, however , easier to protect yourself from lightning than from an earthquake or a hurricane. Prediction There is such a thing as a bolt from the blue (lightning out of a clear , blue sky). The most likely source of lightning is dark thunderclouds. If you see them, take precautions. Lightning is accompanied by thunder . Since light travels faster than sound, you can estimate the distance in miles between yourself and a thunderstorm by counting the seconds that elapse between the lightning and the thunder , and dividing by five. Y ou are still in danger from lightning, even if the storm is far away . Protection You can protect a building from lightning by attaching a metallic rod, wired to the ground, to the highest part of the roof. Action Inside"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"• Stay away from telephones, electrical appliances, computers and, in particular, televisions. • Do not use taps in sinks or bathtubs because metal pipes and water conduct electricity. Outside • Do not shelter under a single tree, as the lightning is likely to strike the tree. • Lie flat on the ground if you are exposed in a thunderstorm. • Find a ditch or depression to lie in. • If you feel your hair standing on end out in the open, bend forward and put your hands on your knees. Adopt a low crouching position with your feet together and hands on ears to minimise thunder shock. Remove any metal objects. • If you need to take shelter in a cave, make sure you go deep inside if possible. Do not stay near the mouth of the cave. • Avoid water. • Avoid high ground. • Avoid open spaces. FLOOD Floods are a common and very dangerous form of natural disaster , especially for the large part of the Earth’ s population living beside coasts, river deltas and estuaries. After rainfall, water is absorbed by the soil and vegetation, or by evaporation. The remainder , called the runof f, runs into streams and rivers. When the runof f is too large, and streams and rivers cannot contain it, a flood is caused. Intense rainfall over a small area causes flash floods. Handling a flood while in a car Flood avoidance Prevention is always better than cure. Forward planning and common sense may save you from a potentially disastrous scenario that may result either in serious damage to your car or risk of death by drowning. • Check on likely weather conditions for the term of your journey. • Check a map to see if your route will take you near rivers or flood plains in stormy weather. • Consult a route planner such as those provided by major motoring organisations in the United Kingdom. • If there is a risk of flooding, do not drive at all unless it is absolutely necessary. • Make judgments based on the suitability of your vehicle for prevailing conditions. If you are on the road and do come across a flood you will need to make a judgment based on the likely depth of the water and the type of vehicle you are driving. A standard family saloon car will not be capable of driving through water and you are likely to encounter a variety of problems if you do. • The water may prove to be too deep. An average saloon car may float in water about 2ft (60cm) deep. Be aware that it is often difficult to judge the depth of water in a flood."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"• Water may enter the exhaust pipe (especially if the engine stalls). Caught in a flood • Water may be sucked into the engine air intake, which is often located close to the ground at the front of the car. • Water may cause a catalytic converter to crack. This will be expensive to replace. • Water may adversely affect the braking system. Brakes should be tested after emerging from a flood plain. • Water inside the car may cause short-circuits and set off airbags. If the decision has been taken to drive through a flood, first gear should be engaged and the car driven at a steady rate, without causing too much of a bow wave at the front. If you attempt to drive at speed through standing water , even if it is relatively shallow , the car is likely to aquaplane and control over steering will be lost. Do not drive through a flooded area where there is fast-moving water , for example near a river that is in spate. Car flood emergency If the car is caught in a serious flood or driven into a river , lake or the sea, depending on the depth of the water you can: • Abandon the vehicle and wade to safety. • Climb on to the roof of the vehicle, exiting via an open window, and signal for help. • Make an emergency exit as detailed below. If the car is totally immersed in water , the pressure outside and inside the car will be uneven until the car interior has filled with water . In this case it will be dif ficult to open"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"a car door until the pressure has equalised. Also, any attempt to open a window will result in a heavy in-rush of water , which may prove severely disorientating and not give you time to catch your breath. Before the car begins to fill up with water , take a few deep breaths of air to fill your lungs and also to help reduce any possible inclination to panic. T ake a final breath before your head is immersed and instruct any passengers to do the same. Energetically force open a door and signal to any others to exit that way . Once outside the car swim to the surface, having checked that all other occupants are out. Preparation Find out about water level at flood stage in the place you are staying. Fill bathtubs, sinks and buckets with clean water , in case the water supply becomes contaminated. Keep in touch with flood warnings on a battery-operated radio. Action Inside • Collect vital supplies and move to an upper part of the house. Be prepared, if necessary, to climb out on to the roof. Take warm clothing with you. • Take some rope with you to tie yourself and others to a stable structure like a chimney stack if you are on the roof. Outside • Make your way to high ground. • Do not, if at all possible, wade through flood water. If absolutely necessary,perform the routine for river crossings as described in Chapter 12, Rafts and River Crossings. • If you are in a vehicle that has stalled, abandon it and get to high ground as quickly as possible. TSUNAMI Tidal waves called tsunamis are caused by earthquakes with vertical movement that create water displacement. Prediction It is difficult to predict a tsunami from the behaviour of waves at sea, since tsunami waves might travel a long way at a height of no more than 3ft (1m) and therefore pass by ships unnoticed. When they reach land they can be about 50ft (15m) high. Japan’ s worst tsunami involved a wave 80ft (24m) high. Tsunami alerts are issued on the basis of earthquake reports. Although this system can work well for places that are far enough away from the earthquake, it is often the case that the tsunami will have struck before the warning can be given."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Keep in touch with earthquake warnings, and beware any unusual rumblings. Preparation Plan an escape route to an inland location that is above the likely height of any approaching wave. Put together an emergency kit with food and first aid. Action • Do not head towards the beach to check if you can see a wave approaching. If you can see it, it is too late to escape. • A series of waves may be involved. Do not return to the danger area until there is a complete all- clear. DROUGHT The average person needs 2 pints (1 litre) of water per day to stay alive. The human diet requires about 300 tons (304 metric tonnes) of water to grow the necessary food for each person’ s annual intake. In the United States drought is defined as less than 0.09ins (2.5mm) of rainfall in 48 hours. In Britain an absolute drought is defined as a period of 15 days with less than 0.009ins (0.25mm) of rain each day . In India a drought is declared if the rainfall is less than 75 per cent of the average. How tsunamis work Major droughts tend to occur at latitudes of about 15–20°, in areas that border on the permanently dry areas of the world. Due to unpredictable rainfall, Africa is more at the mercy of droughts than any other area. Seasonal rainfall in Africa can show large"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"variations within the season, and tends to fall in short and intense storms. The rain can also be extremely localised. Types of drought Meteorological drought Unusual precipitation for a certain region during a certain time scale. Agricultural drought Inadequate soil moisture for the growth of particular plants in certain regions. Hydrological drought Reduced precipitation for an extended period; usual water supplies, such as lakes, rivers and reservoirs, are deficient. Socioeconomic drought Water supplies are so low that the community is adversely affected. Preparation You will need to have a store of water and take care that water supplies do not become contaminated during a drought. Ensure that all water is boiled before drinking. (See Chapter 2, Survival in the Desert, for more tips on finding water in arid regions.) FIRE Aridity and drought can lead to bushfires. Australia is especially prone to these, with the native eucalyptus tree being a prime culprit in the spread of fire. There tends to be a great deal of dry bark and other matter on the floor of Australian forests, providing good fuel for fires. The amount of litter and the time that has elapsed since the last fire are critical in judging how intensely a fire will burn. Prevention • Take great care when lighting a camp fire, especially in a very dry area. Types of fire Ground fire Burns below the surface of the earth in layers of organic material such as peat. They tend to smoulder , have no flame and little smoke. They are difficult to control."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Surface fire Includes grass fires and forest fires that burn debris on the forest floor. They can also burn the lower branches of trees. Crown fire Burns the tops of trees, and they are dangerously unpredictable. They can burn ahead of the surface fire. Spot fire Caused by burning leaves and bark being blown ahead of the main fire, and causing secondary fires elsewhere, sometimes many kilometres away . • Use a constructed fireplace or light the fire in a trench at least 1ft (30cm) deep. • Clear the ground in the area at least 10ft (3m) from the camp fire. • Do not light a fire when conditions are hot and windy, and when the bush is very dry. If you see a fire starting, use a branch with green leaves to damp it down or use any available fire-fighting equipment, such as poles with flaps on the end, which can be found in most forests. Do not swing the flames around and thus spread the fire.Remember that fires burn more rapidly uphill and that burnt material can roll down the hill. Action If you are trapped by a fire: • Try to crouch in a pond, lake or river. • Look for shelter in a clear area. Recommended safety area around a camp fire in a forest"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"• Lie flat and cover your body and head with wet clothing or with soil. • Breathe the air close to the ground to avoid scorching your lungs or inhaling smoke. • As a last resort, if you see an opening, and the fire is not too deep or too high, you can attempt to dash through the flames to the area behind them that has already been burnt. You will need to be absolutely resolved to go all the way through and not try to turn back, so be sure. If the flames are higher than head height, do not attempt to run through them. • If you decide to dash through the flames, cover as much of the surface of your body as possible and dampen clothes and hair if you have water. • If your clothes catch light, do not stay on your feet once out of the fire, crouch down. • Do not try to escape a fire by running uphill, unless absolutely necessary. VOLCANO Volcanoes are formed by the outpouring of lava and by other fragment material. There are a number of active volcanoes around the world and some volcanoes, such as Vesuvius, are dormant. Dangers When a volcano erupts, lava mixed with steam and other gases is forced out of the earth and forms an impenetrable cloud. The lava rises inside the vent of the volcano, some pieces shoot up into the air and other lava flows over the crater . Some lava may emerge from a secondary vent in the side of the volcano."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"The lava flow is generally slow-moving, though this is not always the case. Pahoehoe is a smooth lava that forms a ropy surface. Aa is sharp and twisted, much like clinker , and tends to flow faster than pahoehoe. The latter flows at about 3ft (1m) per minute, though if the slope is steep and the lava emission is heavy , this speed can increase to 14mph (400 metres per minute), which can overtake a person. Aa tends to move in surges, piling up each time before moving on. As well as lava, the volcano can throw out material which ranges from fine ash to 8-tonne bombs that can travel up to 3 miles (5km). This flying material, or pyroclastic flow , is the most dangerous element of the the volcano, since the lava itself, with a certain amount of warning, can be avoided without too much dif ficulty. Another highly destructive characteristic of some volcanoes is nuees ardentes, or glowing clouds. These are ground-hugging clouds of molten lava fragments that can move with great speed down a mountain. Secondary effects Secondary ef fects from a volcano include earthquakes (normally preceding the eruption), flash floods, landslides and mudflows, thunderstorms and tsunamis. In Colombia, in 1985, a volcano precipitated a landslide of mud and rock that buried a whole town and its inhabitants. Because the soil on the edges of volcanoes is fertile, larger numbers of people than ever before are willing to take the risk of living in the danger area. The presence of other people does not mean it is safe. Prediction It is difficult to predict accurately a volcanic eruption, just in the same way as it is difficult to predict an earthquake. One of the best indications of timing is the record of the particular volcano, which will give a fair idea of when it is likely to erupt again. An earthquake almost invariably precedes an eruption, though the timescale can vary from hours to months. Preparation Learn about and be aware of the warning systems in your area. Remember that some countries have better warning systems than others, so be prepared to make your own judgments about danger signs when necessary . Always err on the side of caution, because even highly experienced volcanologists have been killed by volcanoes. Make sure you have an evacuation plan prepared. Ideally , this should involve getting to high ground as far away from the eruption as possible. Also prepare an"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"alternative route.

There may be damage to electrical systems within buildings. • Ruptured gas mains. • Fires and floods. • Dangerous flammable or toxic fluids and materials. • Ruptured water pipes and contaminated water. • Burst sewage pipes. • Aftershocks that can bring downweakened structures. • Animals, even tame ones, becoming more dangerous. Treat all animals with caution. Use your common sense, and proceed with caution. Finally , do not forget to help others in need, such as children and the elderly . VEHICLE PREPARATION AND MAINTENANCE You will greatly reduce the danger of becoming stuck in a remote area if you have checked and maintained your vehicle properly .

Vehicle recovery The following items may be required if you get your vehicle stuck in mud, ice or sand: Winch, large bow and D-shackles, tow-rope, kinetic recovery rope, high-lift jack with jacking plate, spade. Vehicle protection Depending on the kind of terrain you will be negotiating, you may need some or all of the following equipment: Bull bars, sump guard, sand channels, armoured brake hoses, light covers, roll cage. DRIVING OFF-ROAD Keep the vehicle moving and have maximum traction. Do not drive too fast of f-road and try not to come to a halt in a soft area, which will cause the wheels to spin. Getting stuck If you do come to a halt and the wheels start spinning, take your foot of f the accelerator . If you keep the wheels spinning the vehicle will simply dig deeper into the hole. First of all try reversing out slowly . If the vehicle still does not move, try rocking it gently in a forward gear to try to tease it out of the hole. If this does not work, get out and place brushwood or stones under the wheels to improve traction. Y ou may have the option of either towing the vehicle out with another vehicle, or using a winch with one end attached to the front of your vehicle and the other to a solid object, such as a nearby tree."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"When towing or winching, make sure any bystanders are well out of reach of the length of the towing cable in case it should suddenly snap. Winching • Keep bystanders well clear. • If you are in the vehicle, raise the bonnet for protection. • Wear strong gloves when handling cable. • Wear boots with good grip. • Put a piece of canvas on the middle of the cable to reduce recoil if the cable breaks. • Place the winch sling round a tree or rock. Ruts Drive across ruts at a diagonal to keep all four wheels on the ground and provide the maximum traction. If the ruts are not too deep, you can drive along them like a train. Beware of sudden spins on the wheel and try not to fight the direction of the ruts. If they are too deep, you will need to place one side of the wheels on the top of one of the ruts and the other side of the wheels on the verge. T ry not to slip of f these two supports. Sand Sand becomes progressively more dif ficult to drive on as it becomes drier during the day. The tyres can be deflated to a pressure of about 12lb per square inch (5kg per 6.5 square cm) to aid sand travel but remember that this also reduces ground clearance. If the vehicle enters soft sand, change to four-wheel-drive and keep the vehicle moving evenly , changing down smoothly when necessary , and keeping the wheels as straight as possible. Water To drive through water you will need to check that the vehicle is waterproofed in the vital areas, such as the electrics and any breathing tubes. W ade across the water obstacle with ropes attached and carefully check the depth of the water , the strength of the current and for any hidden obstacles. Y ou will need to ensure that any loose items either in or on the vehicle are securely lashed down. The crossing should be performed at a low and constant speed until the vehicle is well clear of the water . Check over the vehicle and remember that there will be a temporary reduction in braking ef ficiency for a while after leaving the water . Hills"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"A four-wheel-drive vehicle is normally high-sided and therefore it is relatively easy to tip it over .

This can be picked up from books, though finding a centre that can provide practical training is probably the best option. First Aid he sequence for administering first aid should be as follows: 1. Is it safe? 2. Rapid assessment: ABC (Airway, Breathing, Circulation)."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"3. If necessary, institute immediate resuscitation. 4. Recovery position, if appropriate. 5. Full assessment: examination techniques. 6. Stabilise condition and get help as needed. IS IT SAFE? The first thing to ask yourself when you come across a victim is: ‘Is it safe?’ This means that you should consider whether you will be risking your own life in rushing to the aid of the victim, for example by running into a busy road. Once you have checked the potential risks, move the victim to a safe place, e.g. dragging them of f a road or away from a rockfall. Y ou may need to remove a dangerous object from the vicinity of the victim, making sure you do not put your own life at risk in the process. Artificial resuscitation, clearing blockages and improvising stretchers and slings are several of the many first aid techniques you will learn in this chapter . Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation RAPID ASSESSMENT: ABC ABC stands for Airway , Breathing, Circulation. These three must be checked – and in that order – properly to assess the victim’ s overall condition."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Airway Check that the airways are open and clear , and that there are no obstructions, such as blood, vomit, loose teeth, etc. Check that the tongue has not fallen back down the throat. Use a gudel airway if necessary . Breathing Look to see that the chest is rising and falling. Listen for the sound of breathing. Feel with hand in front of nose and mouth for exhaled air . Circulation Check for a pulse. Is the pulse strong and regular? Check for major blood loss. Institute immediate resuscitation, if necessary . ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATION If the victim is not breathing, he or she will die in a short time. Y ou must, therefore, restore breathing immediately (see left). After clearing the airway of any blockages and ensuring the victim is on a reasonably firm surface (A), tilt the victim’ s head backwards and place the heel of your hand on the forehead of the victim so that the chin is raised. With the hand resting on the forehead, pinch the victim’ s nose with thumb and forefinger (B). T ake a deep breath, place your mouth tightly over the victim’ s mouth and blow air from yours into their mouth (C). Stop blowing when the victim’ s chest is expanded (D).

Give the victim further quick breaths, taking a deep breath yourself between each one. Carry on blowing into the victim’ s lungs at a rate of 12 breaths per minute until the victim begins to breathe on his or her own. Y ou can then stop blowing at this stage. EXAMINATION TECHNIQUES The basic sequence when assessing a victim, unless the symptoms are obvious, is – LOOK, FEEL, LISTEN. If you are examining a limb joint, the sequence is: LOOK, FEEL, MOVE. A general examination should take into account the victim’ s weight and general fitness, their skin tone and their psychological state at that time. Lie the patient down and examine the following, from the right of the body . Reassure the patient continuously . Hands – check nails and palms for anaemia. Pulse – check the rate, rhythm and volume. Blood pressure – hypotension is low , hypertension is high. Head – eyes, ears, lips and mouth. Neck – check not broken/bruised. Chest – lungs and heart. Abdomen – liver , spleen, kidneys. Limbs – look, feel, move. CARDIO-PULMONARY RESUSCITATION (See p170.) This method is used when the patient has stopped breathing and when there is no pulse. It should only be performed by someone who has had training in the method. Never perform this technique if there is even a trace of a pulse. If after performing artificial resuscitation the victim’ s heart is still not beating, place the heel of one hand on the lower part of the breastbone and place the other hand on"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"top (A). T ake care when you apply pressure not to damage the ribs (B). Y ou should compress the breastbone 80 times per minute, with a pause every 15 to give the victim two breaths (C and D). If there are two people available to help, one should perform the chest compression and the other mouth-to-mouth respiration. This should be at a ratio of one breath per five compressions. Y ou should give 60 compressions per minute with a pause of one to one and a half seconds after every five compressions. Children and infants You should exert less pressure and increase the number of compressions per minute. Use two fingers on an infant, compressing 100 times per minute. T ake care only to depress to about 1in (2.5cm). With children up to 10 years, use the heel of one hand and push lightly 90–100 times per minute. Only compress by 1½ins (3.5cm). Y ou should give five compressions for every lung inflation. CHOKING (See p172–73.) Choking is caused by a blockage of the airway , often by food. Signs of choking are a person holding their throat, an inability to cough, a wheezing sound, blue skin (if unconscious), no rise and fall of the chest (if unconscious). Conscious victim Lower the victim’ s head to below chest level and then administer some blows to the back (A). They should be firm but take care not to damage the spine. If this does not work, stand behind the victim and place one fist just under the breastbone or sternum (B). Hold the fist with the other hand, and then make a sharp, hard thrusting movement inwards and upwards (C). If you are alone and you are choking, administer abdominal thrusts to yourself with your hands (D) or use a blunt projection, for example, a tree stump or , if you are indoors, the back of a chair (E).

Place the other hand on top, and press with a quick upward thrust. If the obstacle is not freed, try removing it with a finger or an instrument such as a pair of forcepts or tweezers. Use a torch if necessary to examine the upper airway . If the victim stays unconscious, call for help. If there is no breathing, use artificial respiration. Infant Straddle the baby over your arm with the head below the level of the rest of the body . Support the baby’ s head by holding its jaw . Give the baby four firm blows between the shoulder blades, taking care not to damage its spine or bruise it. Choking"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Recovery Position RECOVERY POSITION If there is any danger of spinal injury , particularly to the neck, the spine should be immobilised before moving. If there is no danger of spinal injury , place the victim in the recovery postion, which will stop them choking. Turn the head of the victim towards you, tilting it back slightly so as to open the airway. Put the arm that is nearer to you by the side of the victim and slide it under their buttock. Lay the other arm across the chest of the victim. Then place the leg that is further away from you across the one that is nearer to you at the ankle. Pull the victim gently towards you by grasping clothing around the hip with one hand, and support the head with the other hand. Rest the victim against your knees. Bend the top-side leg so that the body does not roll. Keep the head tilted back to maintain an open airway . NEAR DROWNING Signs of near drowning include: • Pale and cool skin. • No breathing."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"• Blue lips (cyanosis). • Weak or absent pulse. • Unconsciousness. Treatment ABC – Airway , Breathing, Circulation. CPR – Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation if the victim has no pulse. Treatment for hypothermia. Treatment for shock. It is vital that you keep the head lower than the rest of the body in order to allow water to drain naturally from the lungs. If the patient is coughing and spluttering, turn him/her on their side. If he/she is unconscious, use the recovery position (see diagram opposite). Then call for medical assistance. BLEEDING Severe loss of blood will lead to shock (see below). Bleeding can be arterial, venous or capillary , in order of seriousness. Arterial Blood in the arteries is under high pressure, and therefore if an artery is ruptured the victim is in danger of a fatal loss of blood, and could die within minutes. Arterial blood can be recognised by its bright red colour and by the spurting ef fect in time with the pumping of the heart. Venous Venous blood is more easily controlled than arterial blood, and is a darker shade of red. Capillary The blood vessels opened in minor cuts and grazes. Severe wounds First of all apply direct pressure to the wound in order to stop the flow of blood. Y ou will need to allow enough time for the wound to seal itself. Apply a sterile dressing with firm pressure to control the bleeding. If bleeding continues, do not remove the"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"first dressing but add other dressings on top, as appropriate. If there is no fracture or dislocation, try to raise the limb that has been wounded and support it. Another , less ef fective way of controlling bleeding is by using pressure points to seal off an artery above the wound. Y ou should apply pressure at the end of the joint just above the injured area. On the hands, feet and head, this will be the wrist, ankle and neck respectively . Cuts and grazes If there is a slight cut, try to rinse the wound in clean water to remove any grit or dirt. Dab it gently with sterile gauze to dry it and quickly apply a dressing or plaster . Internal bleeding Signs of internal bleeding may include frothy , bright-red blood coughed up by the victim (indicating bleeding in the lungs) or red blood in vomit (indicating bleeding in the stomach). Internal bleeding may be less obvious than external bleeding, in which case you can make deductions about what is likely to have resulted internally from the type of accident the victim suf fered or the areas of bruising or tenderness. Other signs and symptoms of internal bleeding include: • Pale, clammy skin. • Rapid and weak pulse. • Rapid, shallow breathing. • Tenderness in the abdomen. • Any pain or discomfort. • Nausea and/or vomiting. • Shock. If you suspect internal bleeding, lay the victim down with their legs elevated and their knees bent. Remember , all a person’ s blood can be lost in the body cavities. Call for medical assistance. Do not give anything by mouth. WOUNDS Open wounds need to be treated with great care in a survival situation because of the danger of contamination and the dif ficulties in keeping things clean. Remove any clothing from around the wound, if necessary by cutting it away . Clean the skin round the wound and irrigate the wound to remove any dirt. Cover it with a clean dressing, which should be changed daily to check for infection. If the wound does become infected, place a warm moist compress on it and hold it there for 30 minutes. Allow the wound to drain. Then dress and bandage the wound"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"again. If maggots get in the wound, you can leave them for as long as they are feeding on dead tissue. Pain and redness indicate that they have begun to feed on live tissue, in which case the maggots should be flushed out with sterile water or urine. General rules for applying dressings • The dressing pad should always extend well beyond the wound’s edges. • Place dressings directly on a wound. Do not slide them from the side, and replace any that slip out of place. • If blood seeps through a dressing, do not remove it; instead, apply another dressing over the top. • If there is only one sterile dressing, use this to cover the wound, and use other materials as top dressings. TIP: Burns Type of Burn Damage Treatment First- degree Top layer of skin, e.g. sunburn. Skin turns red and then peels off. Rehydrating creams. T reatment for restlessness, headache or fever – cool water at regular intervals. Second- degree Deeper damage to the skin, causing blisters. Shock. Use antibacterial dressing, or leave wound undressed but kept scrupulously clean. Treatment for shock. Third- degree Damage to all layers of skin. Shock. Requires specialist treatment. Applying sterile dressings • Remove the wrapping. Unwind the bandage’s loose end, taking great care not to drop the roll or touch the dressing pad. • Unfold the dressing pad, holding the bandage on each side of the pad. Put the pad directly on the wound. • Wind the short end of the bandage once around the limb and the dressing to secure the pad. Then, leave it hanging. • Wind the other end of the bandage around the limb to cover the whole pad, leaving the tail hanging free. • To secure the bandage, tie the ends in a reef knot, tied over the pad to exert firm pressure on the wound."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"• Check the circulation to the extremity of the injured limb. Loosen the bandage if necessary. Adhesive dressing If it is a gaping wound, you can use adhesive tape cut in the closure form of a butterfly clip to bring the sides of the wound together . Ensure the wound is thoroughly clean and sterile before closure. If necessary , and if you have confidence and training, you can use sutures. Suturing a wound Ensure there are no pockets of air or blood left below the skin. Make sure all materials used are clean. Pass the needle into one edge of the skin, through the full depth of the wound and out of the other edge. Knot each stitch at one side. T ake in equal amounts of skin on both sides to align the edges of the wound. Tie the sutures with a square knot. Loop over the needle holder , grasp the end through the loop and pull tight; loop round the needle holder in the opposite direction, grasp the end through the loop and pull tight again. You should leave the sutures in place for about ten days. When you take them out, grasp the knot with forceps and tweezers and pull the stitch out with a firm pull. BOILS Apply warm compresses for long enough to allow the boil to develop into a head. Y ou can then cut into the boil with a sterile knife or other sharp instrument (hold the blade over a flame first to sterilise it) to allow the pus to drain away . The pus should be thoroughly washed out with soap and water . Cover the wound and check it periodically while it heals. RASHES Rashes can be treated in dif ferent ways according to the cause. The general rule is: keep it dry if it is moist, and keep it moist if it is dry . A rash should be dressed and cared for in the same way as an open wound. Severe burns • Cool the area with water for 10 to 20 minutes or use a burn gel. • Make the victim as comfortable as possible, protecting the wound from dirt. • Do not remove anything that is sticking to the burn. • Do not apply lotions, ointments, butter or fat to the injury. • Provide adequate fluid for the victim to drink."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"• Get help as soon as possible. SHOCK This is the rapid lowering of blood pressure owing to the lack of circulating volume to vital body organs, such as the brain, heart, liver and kidneys. If the victim has suf fered burns they will have lost plasma. If they have suf fered from vomiting or diarrhoea, they will have lost water . The ef fects of shock are inevitably worsened by pain and anxiety . The major signs of shock are: • Pulse – fast and almost imperceptible. • Pallor – pale skin; cold, clammy; sweating; shivering. • Pupils – dilated. Treatment for shock • ABC – Airways, Breathing, Circulation. • Lie victim down and elevate his/her legs. • Provide moderate warmth. • Loosen tight clothing. • Provide reassurance. • Control the bleeding. • Replace fluid intravenously. Do not give the victim food or drink. • Provide pain relief if possible. • Call for medical assistance and/or evacuate by stretcher. FRACTURE This is a break in a bone, usually caused by a fall. A closed, or simple, fracture is where the broken bone ends remain beneath the skin, whereas an open, or compound, fracture is where both ends of the bone protrude through the skin. Signs Swelling, deformity or projecting bone ends. Severe pain, made worse by movement. Treatment • Do not try to force the bones back together again but seek medical assistance. • Treat all open wounds with a clean dressing. • Splint the fractured area in exactly the position that you find it in, pending removal to hospital or the arrival of expert medical aid. • If the arm is fractured, splint it, and then set up a sling if the arm can be moved across the chest. • Do not move the victim at all if you suspect a spinal injury. Splints You can use sticks, tree branches, boards or even a rolled newspaper to make a splint. The splint should be long enough to immobilise the limb above and below the"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"fracture. Ensure the limb and splint are tied at four points, two above and two below the fracture. T ie the splint with non-slip knots, with the knot on the outside. Make sure that the splint is adequately padded anywhere it touches a bony part of the body , otherwise it will be uncomfortable for the victim. Y ou may tie the wounded limb to another part of the victim’ s body, e.g. a wounded leg tied to a healthy leg, or a wounded arm to the chest. Place a splint on each side of the limb. When tying the splints on, make sure the bandages are tight enough to prevent the splints from slipping, but not so tight as to impede circulation. Splints Circulation It is important to check the circulation below the point of injury before tying on the splints. If there is no circulation in this area for too long, the limb may have to be amputated. If the skin is pale or bluish in colour , this may indicate damage to an artery . You can also check by pressing down fingernails into the skin and watching how quickly the colour returns (known as capillary return). Check this by comparing with an uninjured extremity . Also check the temperature of the limb against another limb. Check for circulation after tying on the splints. Damaged arteries require urgent medical attention."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Neck fracture emergency sling Sling (See p185.) This can be made from non-stretching cloth or even a belt. The sling should place pressure on the uninjured side of the body and the hand should be slightly higher than the elbow when put in place across the body .

Alternatively , place a rolled towel or cloth under the neck to support it and two weighted objects on either side of the head to keep it stable until medical help arrives. Fractured ribs"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"A fractured rib causes severe pain, which is worsened by deep breathing. Strapping is rarely used for a rib injury because of the dif ficulty of maintaining breathing with a strap in place. The victim should be encouraged to hold the injured side while taking deep breaths. There is a danger that a fractured rib might pierce a lung. The signs of this may include dif ficulty in breathing, a blue colour (cyanosis) and shock. Get urgent medical help. Skull fracture Most skull fractures are closed and do not create complications. A severe injury may cause bone fragments to be forced inwards, rupturing the blood vessels of the membrane covering the brain. The blood clot that results may press on to brain tissue. If there is straw-coloured fluid seeping from an ear or the nose, this may indicate rupture of the brain membrane blood vessels by a fracture of the base of the skull. The victim should be put in the recovery position, allowing any fluid to run out. Call for urgent medical assistance. DISLOCATION Dislocation means the displacement of two bones in a joint, and usually involves tearing the joint ligament and damage to the joint capsule. A fracture can also be involved. Symptoms are severe pain and swelling round the joint. Do not attempt to manipulate the bones back into position unless you have had first aid training. Instead, make a splint or , if it is a dislocated shoulder , a sling in order to prevent movement. Call for medical assistance. If you have first aid training, act quickly before the muscles around the joint begin to tighten up. Apply traction or pull the joint, then move the attached limb in the direction that it would normally move. Release the traction or pulling force and check for nerve response. If a nerve is pinched, repeat the procedure. Apply cold packs to reduce the swelling. SPRAIN Sprain is the tearing or stretching of the ligaments in a joint caused by a sudden strain. It usually applies to the ankle, when the complete weight of the body is placed on the ankle by a falling motion towards the outside of the foot. There is usually pain and a spasm or contraction of the muscles round the joint."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Apply an ice pack (if available; alternatively a container filled with cold spring water) to the area of the sprain.

POISONOUS BITES OR STINGS Snake bite If the bite is on an arm or leg, place a constricting band, of one to two finger lengths, above and below the bite. If you only have one band, place it between the bite and the victim’s heart. The band should be tight enough to prevent the flow of blood near the skin of the af fected area, but not tight enough to interfere with circulation. If available, place an ice bag over the area of the bite. Do not attempt to suck out the venom. Do not use ointments on the bite. Do not give the victim food, cof fee or tea, drugs or tobacco. Insect bites and stings Remove the stinger by scraping the flesh. Do not squeeze the sack attached to the stinger . Wash the area with soap and water . Use an ice pack on the area if available as this will reduce the spread of poison. If the reaction to the bite or sting is serious, treat as for snake bite.

Worms"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"Ways of preventing worms and other intestinal parasites are to avoid going barefoot, to avoid uncooked meat and raw vegetables that have come into contact with human waste, and to observe good habits of cleanliness such as washing daily . If you do not carry a worm medicine, try one of the following: Salt water Dissolve four tablespoons in 2US/13Ú4UK pints (1 litre) of water . Use this method only once. T obacco Eat one or one and a half cigarettes. Do not repeat the treatment for at least 24 hours. Kerosene Take a dose of two tablespoons, taking care not to inhale the fumes. Again, do not repeat the dose for at least 24 hours. Hot peppers Eaten as part of your daily diet, hot peppers will successfully keep parasites at bay . HEAT INJURIES The availability of water , shelter and wearing the correct kind of clothing are crucial factors in the control of heat injuries (see Chapter 2, Survival in the Desert). A balance must be kept between sweating (which keeps the body cool) and the intake of water . If heavy work is to be carried out, the quantity of water intake must rise to compensate. As well as exertion, other factors that can af fect susceptibility to heat injury are weight, health, fitness and food, and alcohol intake. Heat cramps They are caused by too many body salts being lost, for example, by excessive sweating, vomiting or diarrhoea. Signs of heat cramps include cramps in the arms, legs or abdomen, heavy sweating and thirst. Move the victim to a cool, shady area, give him/her water to drink, and loosen clothing. Seek medical assistance if there is no improvement. Heat exhaustion This is caused by an imbalance between sweating and water intake. The major signs of heat exhaustion include heavy sweating with a pale, clammy skin; headache;"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"dizziness and confusion. Move the victim to a cool, shady area, give him/her water to drink, and loosen clothing. The victim should not be under exertion for the rest of the day . Seek medical assistance if the symptoms do not disappear shortly . Heatstroke This is caused by a failure of the body’ s cooling mechanisms after prolonged exposure to heat and sunlight. The lack of sweat causes the skin to become red and dry. The victim may have a rapid, weak pulse, headache, dizziness and nausea. Move the victim urgently to a cool, shaded area. Give him/her water to drink slowly if conscious, and cool down the victim with water externally , if there is enough available. Massage the victim’ s extremities to improve the blood flow and raise their legs. Seek medical assistance immediately and monitor the victim carefully in case further first aid treatment is required, such as ABC. COLD INJURIES The susceptibility to cold injuries can be aggravated by wind, water , anxiety , dehydration, lack of food, physical condition, physical type, lack of rest, and by psychological factors such as depression, anxiety and poor leadership. To prevent cold injury , wear layers of clothing that can be adapted to the changes of temperature and amount of exertion. Do not wear so many clothes as to cause sweat, as this will lead to both dehydration and wet clothing, which in turn will lose its heat retentiveness. Have warm clothing, such as a woollen pullover , to put on when you have stopped walking, for example. Cold injuries can be dif ficult to detect, especially by the person who is suf fering. Tingling or pins and needles can be signs of a cold injury , as can be pale skin in the area of the injury . Slight cold injury can be treated by placing the af fected part in warmth, such as placing cold feet in a warm dry area where circulation can begin to improve. Do not expose the af fected part to direct heat or attempt to massage. Deep cold injury requires urgent treatment and medical assistance. Chilblains"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"This is caused by lengthy exposure of the skin to low temperatures which causes constriction of the small blood vessels that lie below the surface of the skin. Chilblains presents itself as an itchy , purple-red swelling, usually on a toe or finger . The symptoms should disappear as soon as the af fected part is warmed, e.g. exposed hands put in warm gloves. Trench foot or immersion foot This is caused by the exposure of feet to wet and damp conditions over a prolonged period. Feet will initially turn pale, with little detectable pulse, and later become red, swollen and painful, with a strong pulse. If the feet are at the stage where they are pale, warm them gently . Do not expose them to direct heat as this can lead to gangrene (tissue death). If the feet are at the stage where they are red and swollen, cool them down gradually . Painkillers may be required. Do not massage the feet or apply direct heat or cold, such as ice. T o prevent trench foot, ensure that socks are changed daily . You can keep up a rota of socks by tying a damp pair round your midrif f where they will dry as you go about your activities. Frostbite Direct exposure to wind and cold can cause frostbite by damaging tissue. The symptoms are pins and needles followed by numbness. The skin is first white, cold and hard, then it becomes red and swollen. There is a danger of gangrene if the blood vessels are af fected. Place the victim in a warm area and remove clothing from the affected part. Put clean, warm clothing on the af fected part and keep in a warm area, such as under the armpits if it is your own hand. Seek medical assistance. Hypothermia Hypothermia involves body temperature falling below 99°F (37°C). The signs are drowsiness and lowered breathing and heart rate, which can lead to unconsciousness and even death. Wind chill and wet clothing can increase the susceptibility to hypothermia. Treatment involves urgent rewarming of the whole body , evenly and gently . If the victim has any wet or frozen clothing, remove it and replace it with clean dry clothing. Place the victim in a sleeping bag in a warm protected area. Ideally someone else should also be in the sleeping bag to improve the warming conditions. Be ready to"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"give artificial respiration if the victim’ s breathing stops. Seek medical assistance immediately . PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS Anxiety This is a sense of impending disaster , which can be brought on in a survival environment by the dif ficulties of finding basic needs. Symptoms may include palpitations, stabbing pains in the chest and dif ficulty in breathing, sighing and overbreathing. There may also be muscle tension, pains in the back and a tendency to grasp things too tightly . Other symptoms may include dry mouth, diarrhoea, nausea, belching and dif ficulty in swallowing. External symptoms may include pallor , sweating and yawning. Anxiety will reduce performance if steps are not taken to counter it. The best short- term way of coping is to try to identify the particular problems causing the anxiety . Write them down and deal with them one by one. As you deal with the problems that are making you anxious, you are likely to become more confident and less anxious. Depression Depression can involve a feeling of hopelessness or inability to cope, perhaps in the face of overwhelming dif ficulties or repeated failure. Anxiety can be linked to depression, and in many people the symptoms involve slowing down and listlessness. Depression can be made worse by feelings of guilt or personal fault, especially where there is little reassurance to the contrary . A depressed person may feel that anyone else would have performed better in particular circumstances. This may result from over-competitive or dominating behaviour by others. A cure for this negative way of thinking is for the depressed person to think about and develop their personal gifts and to take sensible measures in dealing with weaknesses. Depression is common and should be viewed as something that will pass away . Consider that even a great man like Winston Churchill suf fered from depression, which he called his ‘black dog’, but he did not allow it to grip him for too long. T ry and view your depression dispassionately and do not let it grow roots. Let it pass away . Stress It will be natural to suf fer stress in a survival environment, especially one that has involved any kind of accident. Stress is the body’ s natural way of dealing with"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"problems that require urgent reactions, and in the right circumstances it will improve performance. If the stress factor continues for a long period, however , the body’ s reactions have a tiring ef fect which actually reduces the ability of the individual to cope. Exposure to stressful situations can cause symptoms of anxiety or depression, such as palpitations, indigestion and muscular aches and pains. The best way to deal with stress is to attempt to control it. Y our ability to control it will improve with practice, though in the early stages there is a strong urge to let the body’s reactions rule you and for you to lose your composure. When circumstances allow, make a conscious ef fort to calm your racing mind and to slow your physical movements (unless of course you are in an emergency , such as a fire, where you need to think and move very fast). Identify the problems that are stressing you, itemise them and set about dealing with them one by one."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"F 9 Survival is, in essence, about making the best use of available resources so that what is lacking can be made useful, and what is available can be used in the most efficient way. Firemaking, T ools and W eapons ire has long been one of the fundamental tools of mankind, giving him superiority over other animals and which gave him a multitude of options in mastering his environment. From Neolithic times, man learned how to create fire by creating friction with tools, such as saws and drills and by producing sparks with stones such as flint. FIREMAKING"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"Whichever area you find yourself in, whether it be deserts, tropics or polar regions, a fire is always essential. A fire will provide warmth and dry clothes, it will cook food and heat drinks, it will keep wild animals at bay and ward of f insects. It provides light, it can be used for signalling and, last but not least, a fire provides a special morale booster . In order to start and maintain a successful fire it is vital to collect the right grades of material and to get the balance right between the dif ferent elements of the fire, which are air, heat and fuel. In a survival situation, fire is your greatest asset. Find dry wood and kindling to start a fire (use friction to create a spark) and ensure it is kept alight until rescue arrives. MATERIALS Tinder This is required to get a fire started from the first sparks and may consist of wood shavings, lining of bark, sawdust, cotton fluf f, bird down, dried grass or pine needles. Kindling This is the material you use to expand the fire to the stage when it can take larger fuel. It includes twigs, bark, tufts of dry grass, paper or rags soaked in fuel. Fuel This may be wood, such as dead branches or the inside of trees, coal, peat (as long as it is dry enough – look at the top of undercut banks), dry animal dung, or dry grasses twisted into bunches. SITE Build the fire in a place where it will not be put out by a strong wind or falling snow , or where it is likely to set light to vegetation or your equipment. Consider whether you will need to build stones round the fire to concentrate the heat (for cooking), or whether you will need to construct a reflector to maximise the heat in a shelter . The fire should be built on a firm base, which can be made up of stones, green wood or solid earth. The fire may need to be in a hole in the ground or surrounded by rocks if wind is likely to be a problem."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Safety night fire TYPES OF FIRES There are a number of dif ferent kinds of fire lays that are suitable for dif ferent uses and areas. Safety night fire This type of fire is designed to burn through the night with minimal risk of falling logs. It can also include a heat reflector , set back from the fire. It is designed to have few air spaces, so that the flame will burn low , and two leaning logs have the ef fect of pushing the fire away from your shelter . Long fire (See p200.) This fire can be constructed either as a trench or between two parallel green logs. The logs should be thick, and supported by two sticks to improve the airflow. T-fire Just as it sounds, this is a fire kindled in a simple T shape carved out in the earth. It is an ideal fire lay for cooking on, since the main fire can be maintained in the top part of the T, while cooking can be done on hot coals and embers that fall into the stem of the T. Tepee fire (See p200.) This fire is good for both cooking and heat, and is constructed with a slanting stick fixed into the ground over some tinder . Other sticks are then leant on the"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"slanting stick, leaving a suitable opening on the wind side. The fire should be lit with your back to the wind. Star fire (See p200.) An economical fire which should be made with hardwood logs. The logs are arranged in a star shape and gradually pushed inwards as they burn away . Pyramid fire (See p200.) Lay two logs parallel to each other , and lay a number of smaller logs across them to form a base. Lay another layer of yet smaller logs at right angles to form the next layer , and so on, until you have a small layer at the top on which to light your tinder . The fire will gradually burn downwards, making it a good long-term fire to have during the night. LIGHTING A FIRE Make sure you gather all materials before you start. Matches Windproof matches are the easiest and most obvious way of lighting a fire, and you should have a set in your survival kit. Y ou might, however , wish to keep these for emergencies or you may have run out. If you are planning to set out on a journey , keep the matches, since you will have less time when travelling to set up other means of fire lighting.

Angle the glass to obtain a concentrated ray of heat on to some dry tinder , which should start smoking and then glow red. Blow gently to encourage a flame. Flint In your survival kit you should have a fire-lighting piece of equipment which consists of a small saw and a small metal bar . It is easy to draw the saw across the bar to produce a strong spark. Otherwise, a piece of flintstone can be struck with metal to produce the same ef fect. Battery You can attach wires to each terminal of the battery and touch the wires together to produce a spark to start a fire.

Small particles of wood are thrown up by the ploughing and the friction should eventually ignite them. TOOLS AND WEAPONS Club The club is a basic and useful tool which can be used for finishing of f animals caught in traps, or for killing slow-moving animals, as well as for providing a sense of security in the wilderness. The easiest club to make is a medium-sized staf f which is thick at one end and fits securely into the hand.

Take a forked stick and fit a slightly narrower stone into the fork, and lash the fork ends securely . Alternatively , the end of the wood can be shaved and bent over the stone, to be lashed back onto the shaft. This kind of club will require careful construction and maintenance. Fire plough Throwing stick Find a piece of hardwood bent naturally at about 45° and shape it like a boomerang. If you cannot find a curved stick, use a straight one about 2ft (60cm) long with a thickened end. Spear The simplest kind of spear is a bamboo shaft shaved on one side at the end. This will provide a very sharp and useful weapon that can be used on small game. Similar spears can be made from hardwood poles sharpened at the end. Alternatively , attach a piece of sharp metal or bone to the end of a shaft by splitting the shaft at the end and inserting the blade into the groove before lashing it securely . A prong-like ef fect can also be achieved by splitting the end of the shaft and keeping the sharp points apart with spacers lashed in. This kind of spear will be useful for fishing.

A stick can be shaved on the insides at both ends, away from the central area, which will be gripped in the hand, in order to improve its qualities. Cut notches at both ends for the string, which should ideally be made from rawhide. Sling the bow taut but not too tight. The wood can be maintained by rubbing animal fat or oil into it. The arrows can be sharpened hardwood sticks or have suitable pieces of stone, bone, metal or glass attached.

Three stones should be enough. Swing the stones above your head, taking care not to hit yourself, and release in the direction of the prey. Practice is definitely required if this weapon is not to be of greater danger to yourself than to your prey .

This can be determined by looking for"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"droppings, tracks, burrows, hair and fur . The dif ference between an animal trail and a run is that the former will be used by a variety of animals, whereas the latter is used by only one species. Make sure your trap is adapted to the run and to the animal you wish to catch. SNARES A snare is a wire or string loop placed in such a way that an animal is forced to put its head through it. The snare then tightens, killing the animal, though not always immediately . Commercial snares are often self-locking, but the home-made variety can be just as ef fective. Y ou should have some simple snares in your survival kit and try to disguise your human smell on the snare by smearing your hand with mud when handling it, and/or covering the snare with ashes. Water is the most precious commodity in a survival situation, but you will soon die if you do not locate food. This chapter instructs you how to live off the land safely. Positioning snares"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Positioning snares (See pp210–1 1.) Position the snare in such a way in the animal’ s run that it will be difficult for the animal to avoid it.Keep the loop open and unrestricted, and a proper distance of f the ground. Wire snares are easy to position because of their rigidity . Set snares on heavily used trails or in areas where animals feed on vegetation or a carcass (A, B and C), or near a den or frequently visited food store (D). Do not place the snare too near water , as the animal will be extra alert in these areas. Arrange the surrounding vegetation in such a way that there is a tunnel just before the snare, slightly wider than the animal’ s body. Take care to avoid breaking vegetation when setting up the channel and leave the area looking as natural as possible, by , for example, smearing mud into cuts in trees."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"The snare will need to be attached to a firmly embedded stick or branch that will hold the animal when it struggles. Make sure you regularly check any snares you have set up, since the animal will have a better chance of escaping given more time, and it may also be taken by another predator . Animals will normally be moving about at first and last lights. Twitch-up snare This type of snare will release a branch under tension or with a counterweight. Use two forked sticks, one with a short fork to act as a catch. One stick is driven into the ground, while the other is attached to cord holding a sapling under tension. This device should be set up in such a way that when the animal runs through the snare it pulls the fork attached to the sapling away from the catch. An alternative method is to set two sticks with notches in them into the ground on either side of the run. Attach one end of a cord to the sapling and tie the other end to a cross bar which should be set into the notches. The crossbar should be high enough not to impede the run of the animal, and the open snare should be set below it. TRAPS Deadfall (See pp214–15.) Deadfalls are activated either by trip wires or by bait. If the animal runs through a wire or takes the bait, a weight such as a heavy log or stone falls on it and traps or kills it. Making a figure four trigger A figure four trigger consists of an upright stick, a release stickand a bait stick. For the upright stick, cut the top at an angle and square of f the tip to allow it to fit into a notch in the release stick. Cut a square notch near the bottom to fit a corresponding square notch in the bait stick. Flatten the sides of the stick at this notch to guarantee a good fit. For the release stick, cut the top so the deadfall will rest on it securely until triggered. Cut a notch near the top in which to fit the upright stick. Then, cut the bottom end at an angle to fit into the bait stick. To make the bait stick, cut a notch near one end in which to place the end of the release stick. Shape the other end to hold the bait and cut a square notch at the spot"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"where it crosses the upright stick. The notches in the upright stick and the bait should fit firmly together . Rest the trigger on a stone or a piece of wood to stop it sinking into the ground. N.B. Deadfall traps are easily set of f and can kill humans. Always remember where you have set your traps. Spear trap (See p216.) With this device a branch is held under tension with one or more sharp spears attached to it. When the animal trips the wire, the spring-loaded branch is released which drives the spear into the animal. Great care must be taken when setting or checking these traps so that they are not set of f inadvertently . Always approach from behind the spear point. Bird trap A bird trap can consist simply of nooses suspended over a branch where birds alight. ANIMAL HAZARDS • Do not tackle animals such as bears, wolves, big cats, crocodiles, alligators and poisonous snakes, unless you feel it is absolutely necessary. • Do not put yourself in a position where you are cornering a dangerous animal by blocking its escape route. • Beware all animals that are still alive in traps. They will fight for their lives and deliver severe bites to you. • If you find yourself confronted by a dangerous animal, breathe deeply to control your nerves and to convey confidence to the animal. Talk calmly and move away slowly and with assurance. • Make sure a large animal is dead before getting too close. Test by stabbing it with a spear or knife on a stick before you come near it. Deadfall traps"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"Spear traps FISHING Fish are an excellent source of protein and can be caught in a variety of ways. Fish tend to be attracted to the shaded parts of streams and to deep pools and backwaters. Bait Bait should be as similar as possible to what the fish in the area are already feeding on, for example worms, insects, minnows, maggots or scraps of flesh. Fish traps (See p220.)

Y ou can leave lines out in a river with weights attached and smaller lines trailing of f them. This gives you a better chance of getting a catch. Y ou can check the lines for a catchoccasionally . Fly fishing (See p219.) A fishing rod can be improvised from a suitable branch with a line and fly attached. The fly should be whisked on to the surface of the water upstream and allowed to float downstream. Fish will only attempt a bite during seasons when flies and insects are at large. Y ou can use something like a beetle or grasshopper for this kind of fishing, as it will struggle on the surface of the water and attract the attention of fish. Nets (See p219.) Y ou can narrow a stream with stones in order to channel fish to where a net is placed at one end of the stream. Ensure the net is held securely so that it is not taken away by the fish or any other floating material. Nets can be strung out across a stream with stones to weigh down the bottom of the net. Spearfishing (See p219.) Y ou will need to be near shallow water where the fish are large and plentiful. Y ou can use a piece of sharpened bamboo as a spear , or a sharpened sapling, or a pole with a knife, or other blade, attached to the end. Put the end of your spear under water and move it slowly towards the fish. Then impale a fish with a sharp strike.

Move carefully, rolling the foot from the heel through to the toes on each step, so that you can feel for breakable twigs, and other things likely to make a noise, under your feet. • Crawl on hands and knees when necessary to avoid being seen by alert animals. • Stop moving when an animal looks in your direction. Move again when it resumes feeding. • If you get within range, aim at a point just behind the front shoulder. • Do not immediately chase a wounded, bolting animal but give it time to stop again. PREPARING FOOD When an animal is caught it needs to be gutted and skinned properly if it is not to cause unpleasant side ef fects when eaten. Gutting (See pp222–23.) First drain the blood by slitting the throat. Cut around the anus and cut the skin parallel to the penis if the animal is male (A). Insert two fingers between the skin and the membrane containing the entrails. Place the knife blade between your two fingers and cut up towards the chin (B). Cut the diaphragm at the rib cage, and cut the pelvic bone and remove the anus (C). Split open the breast and remove as much of the windpipe as possible (D). T urn the animal on its side and roll out the entrails (E). If it is a large animal, you will need to cut it up to make it manageable. Y ou can cut through the tissue connecting the front legs to the body and cut the hindquarters of f. Cut away the muscles on either side of the spine and separate the ribs from the backbone.

Almond The almond can be found widely across tropical, temperate and arid areas. Similar to the peach tree, the almond is covered by a thick, brown, dry skin. They are highly nutritious, like all nuts. Arrowroot (See p228.) Found in moist areas throughout temperate and tropical zones. It has arrow-shaped leaves. The roots can be boiled as a vegetable. Asparagus Found in temperate areas worldwide. In spring, green, finger-like growths accompany fine foliage and red berries. Boil young stems for at least 15 minutes before eating. Beech Found in many temperate zones in moist areas. The tree has a light grey bark and dark green leaves. Beechnuts are edible after removing a thin shell. Arrowroot"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Blackberry and raspberry Found throughout temperate regions. They have prickly stems and edible fruits of different colours. The leaves can be boiled to make tea. Burdock Found widely in northern temperate zones. There are arrow-shaped leaves and pink flowers with bristly burs. The leaf stalks can be eaten raw or cooked, and the roots boiled. Carob Found in the Mediterranean, Middle East and North Africa. The seedpods are known as St John’ s bread. The young pods are edible raw or boiled. Older pods can be crushed to make a type of porridge. Chestnut Found in temperate and tropical zones. Chestnuts are traditionally roasted in embers, which causes the shell to crack, revealing the delicious and nutritious nut. Chicory"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"(See p230.)

Navigation and Signalling his chapter provides basic information on using maps and compasses as well as navigating without these usual aids. It is recommended that you make yourself familiar with map reading and navigation techniques before setting out on a major"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"expedition. In the signalling section you will find information on how to attract the attention of rescuers. MAPS A map uses lines and symbols to portray a certain geographic area, along with its fixed features which can range from mountains and cuttings to footpaths and bars. Ordnance maps typically have a set of symbols which can be easily understood and which are also explained on the side of the map. Not all maps explain their symbols, so before setting out on a journey into a potentially hazardous environment, make sure that you are familiar with the symbols on the map you are using. In addition to symbols, there will be abbreviations, such as CG – Coastguard. If you are not in possession of a compass to direct you or flares to attract attention do not despair . There are many alternative ways to navigate and signal your way to safety . It is far better to take a reliable and familiar map such as an Ordnance Survey type with you than expect to pick up a map you will be able to understand in the area you are visiting. Scales The scale of a map will be represented in either words or figures, such as 1:50,000, which means that one unit of measurement on the map represents 50,000 of the same unit on the ground. The scale line will show equivalent distances, typically in kilometres, miles and nautical miles. Measuring straight-line distance The measurement to the right of zero on the map scale is called the primary scale, while the measurement to the left of zero is called the secondary scale. The secondary scale has the primary unit of measurement, e.g. a kilometre, divided into blocks, typically of 10 metres. If you want to measure the distance between two points on the map, mark the points on the edge of a piece of paper . Place the right mark on a point in the primary scale with the left point falling on the secondary scale to measure whatever fraction of a kilometre or mile you wish to find out. If you want to measure the distance along a road or track then it is best to use a piece of paper . Place one end at the start and follow the road with the edge of the"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"paper until the road turns away from the paper . Mark the point and swivel the paper round on the pencil until it reaches the road again, and so on. Grid system This provides a straightforward and accurate means of finding a position on a map, and it is governed by easily understood rules. The vertical lines on a map are called Eastings and the horizontal lines are called Northings. Y ou always read the Eastings first and the Northings second. Six-figure grid reference You read the first half of a printed grid reference along the horizontal grid line, representing Eastings. The last figure of that half will represent tenths of the grid square, so estimate the appropriate distance across the grid square (e.g. a figure of 5 means the location is halfway across the grid square). Then follow the same procedure for the second half of the grid reference along the vertical grid line. See the example opposite of 204559. Map grid"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"Contour lines"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"Contours A contour is usually a brown/ orange line on a map that joins areas of the same height. It is a useful way of gauging the lie of the land. There are other ways of showing elevation, such as hachures (short parallel lines), hill shading and layer tints, but these are not as accurate as contours. In addition to contour lines, the map reader can use spot heights and trig points (see p250), and conventional signs to judge elevation. Contour lines on a map are always the same distance apart, e.g. 30ft (10m). The spacing of contour lines indicates the nature of the slope. Evenly spaced and wide"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"apart lines (A) means a gentle, uniform slope; evenly spaced and close together (B): a uniform, steep slope; and a ticked contour (C): a vertical or near vertical slope. Other points to note about contours are: • They always form a v-shape when they cross a river. • They will not show every regularity of the ground that is below the height of the vertical interval between the contours, i.e they won’t show a change in height of 15ft (5m) if the contour spacing is 30ft (10m). • A road or path along which a contour runs is likely to be level. • A stream is always in a valley and a lake or pond in a depression. TIP: Contour lines and what they indicate Contours Type of slope Evenly spaced Uniform Close to each other Steep Far apart Gentle Varied spacing Changeable Close at foot of hill, wide at top Convex Far apart at foot, closer at top Concave Spot height This is normally a black point on the map with a figure beside it showing the exact height above sea level at that point. It is not represented on the ground. Trig point A small triangle on the map with a dot in the centre shows the altitude as well as a location used in survey triangulations. T rig points are represented on the ground by small triangular concrete blocks, which can be seen as the tops of many major hills. Drawing a cross-section of the ground between two points Draw on your map a line of the ground you want to see in cross-section. Draw a second line, of the same length, horizontally on a piece of paper to represent ground level (A–B). Then, above and parallel to this ground level, draw lines to mark the contour heights, e.g. 50, 100, 150, etc. Mark every point on the map where the line crosses a contour , and transfer this data to your duplicate line on the paper . Raise a perpendicular line from each point to mark the appropriate height. Join up all these points to reveal a cross-section of the ground."},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"Cross-section Navigation with a Silva compass Using a Silva compass, you can point the arrow on the front of the compass in the direction you wish to go. Then turn the dial so that the North mark is in line with the red compass needle. Y our bearing will be shown by the black marker , in line with the direction-of-travel arrow . Holding the compass in front of you, it is relatively easy to stay on the correct bearing by keeping the marker of North on the compass lined up with the compass needle. To work out your course from a map, place the side of your compass on a line between your position and your objective. T urn the compass dial until the marked orientating lines on the dial are parallel with the north–south lines on the map, with the orientating arrow pointing north. Note the reading on the marker line and then add the required number of mils for magnetic variation. The compass is now set on the correct bearing.

Point the arrow on the front of the compass at the first landmark and turn the bowl until the North mark on the compass is lined up with the red compass needle. Note the bearing and subtract the correct number of mils for magnetic variation. Place the side of the compass on the landmark on the map and turn the compass base until the orientating lines in the base of the compass dial are lined up with the north–south grid lines, with the orientating arrow pointing north. Draw a line along the compass base from the landmark. Repeat the procedure for the second landmark and find your position from where the two lines intersect. NAVIGATION WITHOUT MAP OR COMPASS There are a variety of navigation aids, some of which are more reliable than others. It is a good idea to work on the evidence of more than one aid before coming to any firm conclusions. Sun The sun rises in the east and sets in the west. At midday in the northern hemisphere the sun is due south, and due north in the southern hemisphere. Watch In the northern hemisphere, hold the watch with the hour hand pointing to the sun. Imagine a line travelling through the 12, and true south is midway between the hour hand and the 12.

Regardless of where you are, the west part of the east–west line shows 0600 hours and the east part 1800 hours. The north–south line becomes the noon line and the shadow of the stick becomes the hour hand. Stick and shadow East–west line: Put a stick about 3ft (1m) high into the ground, which should be flat and clear of debris. Mark the tip of the shadow with a stone. T en minutes later mark it again. The straight line between these points marks the east–west line. North–south line: (See p255.) Put a stick about 2ft (0.6m) high into flat ground. With a piece of string, stretched from the stick, draw an arc round the base of the stick, the same radius as the shadow . When the shadow touches the arc again, mark it with a stone or peg.

Back up the evidence with other means. Certain rules can be followed: • Flowers tend to grow towards the sun. • The foliage of trees will be most abundant on the sunny side. • Moss tends to grow on the damper side of a tree, i.e. the side away from the sun, but this can be influenced by other factors. • In the northern hemisphere, the rings of a tree stump will be closer together on the south side of the tree, and the bark will also tend to stretch more on the south side. Improvised compass needle You can magnetise a needle by stroking it with a magnet or a piece of silk, repeating the process every few hours to keep it magnetised. Hang the magnetised needle freely from a piece of thread, making sure there are no twists in the thread to influence the needle. The needle should point north. DEAD RECKONING This way of estimating distance that you travel involves plotting a series of points on your route with the help of a map, compass, protractor , route card and log. Plot your route on the map, and mark out the distance and direction of each leg of the journey on the route card. When walking, keep a record of the bearing and distance covered in the log. If for any reason you have to change direction, record this in the log. Work out your average pace, as this will help you to tell how far you have travelled. The average pace is 60–70 double paces per 32ft (100m) on flat easy round. Y ou will need to have an idea of the dif ference in your pace when walking uphill, and also the"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"kind of terrain you are crossing. If you are walking on slippery ground or have shoes with poor traction, you will tend to take shorter paces. SIGNALLING Signalling will make a great deal of dif ference to your chances of survival if you can communicate ef fectively , for example to a passing aeroplane. It may be your first and last chance. Y ou do not want to wave frantically at an aircraft only to see the pilot give a friendly wave back and then disappear over the horizon. In this section you can learn a few of the internationally accepted signals that will be instantly recognised by potential rescuers, and also ways to make sure they are likely to be seen. Y ou will need to find the highest and flatest area on which to make your signal. Body signals (See pp260–61.) These should be made in such a way as to make it obvious to a pilot in an aeroplane or helicopter precisely what you are communicating. If the pilot has understood your message he will either tilt his wings or flash green signal lights. If he has not understood, he will encircle the aircraft or flash red signal lights.

Listen carefully to instructions from rescuers at all stages. Fire Three fires in a triangle is an internationally recognised distress signal. They can also be in a straight line with about an 80ft (25m) gap. It is dif ficult to maintain three fires over a long period, so if necessary have one burning and two more ready to light if required. Mirror This can also be a suitably burnished shiny object, like the inside lid of your survival tin. A reflected signal can be seen for up to 62 miles (100km) in normal conditions, and up to 100 miles (160km) in the desert.

A single tree can be set alight and turned into a burning torch. Make sure it is not near other trees that will catch alight. Pyrotechnics Since you are likely to have a limited supply of pyrotechnics, it is best to use them with care, and only when you consider they are likely to be seen by a passing aircraft. An aircraft using the Night Search T echnique will fire green flares every 5–10 minutes. If you see one or more of these flares, wait for the aircraft to be clear of the glare of its own flares and then fire a red flare, followed by a second flare after a short interval."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"The aircraft will turn towards the first flare if it is seen and check its course on the second one, firing a succession of green lights until it is overhead. W ait for the aircraft to be overhead and then fire a third flare. Y ou can also fire the third flare if you think the aircraft is going of f course. Handle flares with great care. Hold them at arm’ s length and at shoulder height, and make sure they are not pointing at anyone or anything. A hand-held flare should have a cap that should be removed before removing the base cap, which will expose a short string or other safety device. Make sure the flare is pointing up and away before pulling the string or other firing device. Prepare yourself for the recoil from the flare as it ignites. A flare may become hot – make sure you do not drop it on anything that will catch fire, or into the bottom of a lifeboat. Lights If you are using signal lights, send six flashes in one minute, then allow one minute’ s pause. Then send six more flashes, and so on. A green light from an aircraft will mean message understood. A red flare indicates distress. A white flare acknowledges or warns. Sound If you are using sound, send six signal blasts in one minute, then allow one minute’ s pause, then six more blasts, and so on. Sound carries further at dusk. If an aircraft rocks from side to side, it means ‘message understood’. If it circles to the right, it means it does not understand the message.

When tying the logs together , make sure you cut deep notches into the logs so that the rope or other material you are using to bind them does not slip under the twisting action that will take place in the water . You can float the logs in the water (making sure they are tied to the land) to see what their natural flotation properties are, i.e. which side will be submerged and which side will form the deck. Place the logs over two cross-bars at either end, with the longest log at the centre and place the next size down on either side symmetrically , so that you have some kind of prow on the raft. Lash the main logs together and then place two bars across the raft at both ends above the other bars. Cut notches in these bars and then lash them together to create pressure on the sides. Y ou can add more cross-bars to form a flatter deck, according to how much time you have and how detailed you require the construction to be. In the wilderness, villages are often formed alongside river banks, so following the course of a river , via a well-built raft, is an excellent way of finding help.

As in all survival matters, you can improvise according to your needs and the available materials. Raft steering You can construct an A-frame at the back of the raft to hold a steering oar , but the A- frame will need to be firmly constructed and lashed if it is not to collapse. Alternatively , you can use a simpler method, which is to build up the rear of the raft with another couple of logs and then fix the steering oar on top of these in such a way that you will be able to turn it without losing it in the water (A). Bamboo raft You can cut 10ft (3m) lengths of bamboo (the number will depend on the number of people using the raft). If you use about 12 lengths, side by side, the raft should be able to take up to four people. In the penultimate bamboo section at each end, cut a hole so that a cross stake can pass through all the lengths of bamboo lying side by side. Each bamboo cane should then be lashed to the cross stakes. Y ou can then construct a second layer to form a platform, ideally with longer arms on the outside so that the platform can be more easily lashed to the bottom layer . The platform will give the raft depth and improve its flotation. Brush raft Take two ponchos and tie of f the necks with the drawstring. Attach ropes to the corners and sides of the ponchos.

Test the device to make sure your measurements are right and that it works before using it in deeper water . You can improvise other flotation devices, depending on your requirements and the materials available. RIVER CROSSINGS You will need to choose a suitable spot to cross a river . Look out for: • A place where you are least in danger of losing your footing. • Easy access to the water on one side and a way out on the other side. • Safety from any dangerous wildlife. • A good vantage point, by climbing a tree if necessary, so that you can plan your crossing. • Currents. Make allowances for being carried downstream by the current and for missing your ideal landing spot. • Where the water is shallowest, or where the river is divided up into separate channels that can be negotiated individually, or where there are natural stepping stones in the water. • Areas to avoid, such as where water is running rapidly over rocks, or where water eddies show that there is an obstacle under water that is creating dangerous back currents. • Estuaries, which you also want to avoid. They can be wide and prone to awkward tide movements. Wading across Take your clothes of f and store them in a plastic bag in your backpack. Keep your boots on to improve traction on the river bed.

Cross the river at an angle of 45° to the current. Roped crossing for three or more people A roped crossing requires a loop of rope about three times as long as the width of the stream. The strongest person should go across first, with the rope tied round his/her chest. The other two let out the rope, making sure it does not snag on any obstacles, ready to haul the first person back if necessary . When across, number one unties himself/herself and number two ties the rope round the chest. That person’ s crossing is monitored by rope holders on both banks. Number three then crosses, with one person holding the rope taut on the opposite side, and the other ready to help pull the rope if necessary . Alternative roped crossing The strongest person goes ahead and ties the rope to a tree or other firm anchor on the far bank. The rest of the team follow , for example by hitching a karabiner with a chest harness on to the rope. The back packs can be brought across in a similar way . The last person swims across, with other team members ready to haul him/her in. Swimming Do not try swimming unless you are confident you can manage the current (throw bits of wood into the river to test the strength of the current), or that it is not too cold and that you will not be tangled up in weed, branches or other obstacles that may be in the river. You will want to keep your clothes dry , so think of how you can create a waterproof flotation device that you can hold in front of you as you swim, kicking with your legs. Use flotation devices, such as the brush raft described above, or anything else that will float, to help you cross.

Ropes and Knots ou may need to tie knots or use lashings in a variety of instances, such as for abseiling or constructing a raft. The following pages will provide guidelines on the most common knots and lashings and it is highly recommended that you prepare yourself by tying a few of them before you set out on an expedition."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"ROPES It is encouraging for the survivalist without modern equipment to know that rope, cord and string used to be made entirely out of natural materials such as plant-stems and stalks. Plants from which they were made included cotton, sisal and hemp. If you are caught without a rope, therefore, you can go a long way by improvising with the natural fibres around you. Although natural materials are still used today , they are generally weaker than modern man-made fibres, which include polyester , nylon, polypropylene and aramid fibres. In this chapter you will learn how to tie all manner of knots, hitches and lashings that could prove vital in a survival situation – from the reef knot and sheet bend to the half hitch and shear lashing.

A bend is a knot that joins two separate ropes or other bits together . A hitch is used to attach a line to a rail, a post, a ring or even onto another rope. Remember that a knot is the weakest part of the rope when it is tied, and will make the rope even weaker if it is not tied properly . Types of knots Overhand knot Make a loop and pass the working end back through it. Double overhand knot This is the same as the overhand knot but the working end is taken twice round the ropes before being fed through. Reef knot This should not be used for major work with ropes, but is useful in tying bits of string or cord together for lighter work. The principle is ‘left over right and right over left’. The loops should then slide over each other . Fisherman’ s knot This is a useful way to join two similar ropes. Lay the two ropes parallel to each other . Tie an identical overhand knot round each standing part with the other working end, and then pull them tightly together . Double fisherman’ s knot A more secure method of joining two ropes, this involves tying two double overhand knots round each rope and pulling very tight.

Sheet bend (See p280.) This can be used for tying ropes of unequal size together , but it can tend to jam and it is not among the strongest of knots. Make a loop near the end of the rope, with the short end on the right. Pass the end of the second rope up through the loop, round the back from right to left, and then tuck through its own standing part. Double Sheet Bend (See p281.) This is more secure and it requires an extra turn through the tuck. Carrick Bend This knot is often used for joining larger ropes and cables. W eave the ropes over and under in such a way that the working ends come out on opposite sides of the knot. Pull the knot tight. Loop making The bowline knot and its variants are some of the most widely used loop knots, largely because they are relatively simple to tie and have a high level of security . The bowline itself is also extremely easy to untie. Like all knots, the bowline knots require practice to make for best use. Bowline (See p282.) This has a wide range of uses and is often used by climbers for tying on. Decide how large you want your loop to be, allow three times the length of the loop, lead the end of the rope up through the loop, around the back of the standing part and back down through the loop (A). Triple bowline (See p282.) This is made with a double rope. First, make a loop and then pass the double working ends through the loop, behind the standing part and back through the loop. This can be used for such requirements as forming a boatswain’ s chair or a chest harness (B). Bowline in the bight (See p282.)

A turn consists of wrapping the rope 360° round a bar so that the end points in the same direction that it was pointing before the turn. This can be used to add extra friction when taking the strain on something and paying out the line slowly . A round turn is a turn-and-a-half, resulting in both ends pointing in the same direction, which gives even more friction and therefore control than a turn. If you add two half hitches, you have achieved this knot, which is often used for tying up boats to a post or bollard.

Bringing the rope between the bars, frap a few times round the binding. End with a clove hitch on the pole opposite the one you started on.

DANGEROUS SITUATIONS"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"Posture You can greatly reduce the chances of coming under attack or of being ‘picked on’ by the way you act or your expression and the way you move. Most assailants are looking for an easy win over their opponent and will measure their chances by signs of weakness. If you move in a calm, measured way , maintain a steady gaze, hold yourself upright with your shoulders back and breathe deeply , you are more likely to project signals of confidence and strength that will deter a potential assailant. If you are walking, resist the temptation to hurry . This will give the impression you are running away and will invite pursuit. Sometimes, you can even try slowing down and walking in a measured way . This will disconcert any potential assailant because it is the last thing they would expect you to do. Certain self-defence techniques, such as the twist punch, can be learned here, but you should attend a class to get a solid grounding in the art of protecting yourself. Physical presence You can ‘act’ confident but it will help if you keep yourself physically fit on a regular basis. A fit person projects strength and confidence almost without trying. You can enhance your physical presence when standing by crossing your arms in front of your chest or by resting both hands on your hips."},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"Dog-handling experts recommend when dealing with an aggressive animal who may be about to attack never to show any signs of panic or to run away . They recommend standing at an angle of about 45° to the animal, with arms crossed and a severe expression on your face. This posture is remarkably similar to the one recommended when dealing with human aggressors. The posture indicates both that you do not want a confrontation (sideways stance) but that you are also ready and not running away . The crossed arms increase your physical presence and will also enable you to rapidly deploy your arms to defend your face and neck. The facial expression indicates you are firm without losing control to anger . You should speak in a calm way with depth of tone. Do not let your hand stray over your face. Although the danger may remain, subliminal messages you send out may make the dif ference between verbal abuse and an actual physical attack.

Distraction assault Awareness Be aware of where you are. Remain near friendly groups and do not let yourself be isolated. If you are alone, do not let yourself get trapped in corners or blind alleys and avoid places such as tunnels. If you are using a train, stay in the crowded carriage. If you have a face-to-face confrontation in a crowded place, you will need to gauge the appropriate level of response and the size of your potential support."},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"If it is a bar or club with either a bouncer or a hefty bartender , you may just need to control the level of prevailing aggression until help is at hand. That way , the aggressor is the one who is likely to be picked up and thrown out and not you. If there is little support available or the bystanders are hostile, you will need to control the situation until you can work out a means of escape. Anger has its own logic and will quickly spiral into violence. It is more dif ficult to control an angry exchange so it will help to keep a dialogue that may exist below the anger threshold. In other words, it is in your best interest to stop the escalation of verbal violence that may lead to physical violence. If a potential assailant’ s words are like water of f a duck’ s back and you do not respond in kind, he will have to justify his own anger and his wrath may begin to subside. At this point you may need to show him the way out: he will need to be able to rationalize that he has won without having had to resort to violence. Show him the door . Distraction assault Someone who stops you in the street for an innocent reason, like asking you the time, may be putting you of f your guard, either to carry out an assault themselves or to allow an accomplice to come up behind you. One of the disadvantages of urban life is that humans tend not to use their senses to full capacity . Everything we require is normally to hand and we have lights and volume controls to aid our senses of sight and hearing at all times. It is useful to be aware of the extent of your field of vision and the capabilities of your peripheral vision. The field of vision in humans is about 180°. Peripheral vision is the capability of seeing outside the centre of gaze. It is divided into ‘far peripheral vision’, on the edge of the field of view; ‘mid-peripheral vision’, in the middle of the field of view; and ‘near peripheral vision’, nearest to the centre of gaze. Although you cannot see as clearly with your peripheral vision as you can with your central vision, it is well adapted to detect movement. This is due to the sensitivity of the ‘rods’ in your eye that are dedicated to peripheral vision. By turning your head, even slightly , from one side to the other you can monitor any movement around you without losing track of what is happening in front of you."},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"If you are unsure about a frontal approach, stay in an easy defensive position at about a 45° angle to the person in front.

It will be to your benefit if you do not allow yourself to be dragged into the cycle of anger and do not allow yourself to be compromised if law of ficers arrive. Y our aim is always to remain as calm as possible and to reduce the level of violence if possible. Apart from anything else, if you remain calm, you are more likely to think clearly . If physical violence seems inevitable, adopt a guard position. If you are right- handed, you should step forwards with the left leg (or the right leg if you are left- handed) and maintain your body at an angle of about 45° to your opponent. Keep your hands open and raised, ready to deflect any blows or missiles. Open hands will send signals to your opponent that you are both open to reason and ready to defend yourself. Keep your vision centralised on your opponent, watching out for lateral limb movements.

Unless you are trained and well practised in martial arts, it is better to learn a few simple techniques that will enable you to deflect blows and to deter an assailant by landing a few of your own. Basic defence against an unarmed attack If, despite all precautions, the chips are down and you come under attack, you have the right to defend yourself. The law being what it is, you must defend yourself in a proportionate way , bearing in mind that you yourself could become liable if the aggressor sustains an injury . It is worth remembering that you may find it dif ficult to prove that you were the victim of an assault and not the aggressor . If you have to get your retaliation in early in order to preempt and deter an attack, the object is either to stop the aggressor from continuing his assault or to allow yourself time to get away . The object of the defence is to make the aggressor feel like he is running into a brick wall, which may cause him to change his mind and give up.

Eye strike"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"Unarmed defence against a knife attack A knife is a formidable weapon when used in close-quarter combat and poses a number of problems for the defender as the knife can be used in both a forward, stabbing, as well as a backwards, slashing, mode. The defender must be aware of the fact that the knife is likely to be extremely sharp so that even the slightest contact at speed is likely to cause a severe wound. Bearing in mind that any defence should be proportionate to the level of the threat, the defender is entitled to use maximum deterrent force when faced with a knife attack, assuming the defender is unarmed of course. Taking into account the potential severity of a knife wound, the first priority is to keep vital organs as far as possible out of reach of the blade. However , you as defender may have to take some risks with your limbs, especially arms and legs, if you are ef fectively to deter a potentially lethal attack. Defending against knife attack"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"Kick to knee or shin (See pp306–07.) This is one example of a defence that maintains the vital organs as far away as possible from the knife. While keeping his arms at the ready to protect his upper body , the defender stands sideways to the assailant, in order to minimise the exposed area of the body , and delivers a decisive kick to the assailant’ s knee or shin, the object of which is to cause him a disabling level of pain. If the assailant doubles up in pain, the attack may be followed up by the defender by raising the knee sharply into the assailant’ s rib cage. This may allow the defender time to take the knife from the assailant and to make good on his escape. Do not use the knife on the assailant. There are a number of other defences against knife attacks, including a defence against a lunge, but it would be naïve to expect that these could be learned successfully from a book. It is recommended, therefore, that sophisticated defence techniques such as these should be learned from professional instructors. The lethal nature and unpredictability of a knife attack is such that for an untrained defender the principle of distracting or keeping the attacker away , should be followed where possible. In order to achieve this, you can throw dust in the assailant’ s eye or use any available weapon such as a stick to strike the knife-bearing arm or to hit some other vulnerable part of the assailant’ s body . The object is to buy yourself enough time to make a successful escape."},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"Defence from the ground If for whatever reason you have fallen to the ground and your assailant is attacking either with a knife or unarmed, the same principle of deterrence applies. A determined kick to the shin or knee of the assailant’ s leading leg may cause him disabling pain, giving you time to escape. Alternatively the kick may be aimed at the assailant’ s groin. TRANSPORT Cars Most cars are fitted with essentials, such as a jack and tools for changing wheels as well as a spare wheel. Ensure that the spare wheel is inflated and/or carry a pump (either a foot-pump or an electric one) in the car with you. Emergency triangles are not always supplied as standard by car manufacturers and it is essential to carry one to provide early warning to drivers, especially if you need to change a wheel on the side of a road and particularly at night. Another useful item is a torch with a flashing setting that can be placed on the car or in some other visible position to act as a warning to other drivers. You should also carry spare water and a first aid kit. Security Most modern cars have advanced security systems, including both standard and deadlocks as well as car alarms. If your car is an older model and does not have such advanced equipment, you may want to consider having an alarm fitted and/or using a steering-wheel immobiliser . If your car is fitted with expensive tyres, alloy or spoked wheels, these will be attractive to thieves and may be stolen. It is advisable, therefore, to fit locking wheel- nuts. It is obvious that valuable items should not be left on display in a vehicle. It is also important, however , that you should not leave less valuable items lying around as this will attract the attention of thieves and raise the expectation that there may be other , more valuable items in the car . Fuel, oil and water You should check the fuel level in the car at the beginning of each journey and you should also be aware of likely fuel stops on a long journey . If you are in a rural area,"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"for example, fuel stations may be few and far between or they may close early . If you are planning to travel long distances in remote areas, it may be necessary to take a spare can of fuel. You should also check oil and water levels in the car and keep it regularly serviced. Check the level in the windscreen washer receptacle and also check that your wiper blades are in good condition and not frayed or breaking up. Safety Whether in a remote rural area or the back streets of a city , it is advisable not to stop if someone signals to you to do so as it may be a set-up for a crime. Likewise, it is advisable not to pick up hitchhikers. If you are concerned about a breakdown, drive on to the next town and inform the police. In an inner city area it is advisable not to open your windows to buy flowers or to agree to having your windscreen washed. Road rage The personal space of a car often seems to contribute to styles of behaviour that would not occur if the same people were walking on the street. If you inadvertently cut across another driver , he may gesticulate rudely and drive on or he may stop in front of you and get out of his car in order to continue the argument. If this happens and there is enough room, simply drive round the obstacle and get away . If you cannot move, keep your windows closed and lock the doors. Remain calm and do not fuel the argument. Parking You should try to avoid parking in unlighted areas, especially in a remote inner city or rural area. If this is unavoidable, try to take a companion with you and also carry a torch. Also beware underground car parks or similar areas where any potential assailants can conceal themselves. Trains (See p312.) T rains, whether overground or underground, present a number of security risks. Especially if you are travelling outside peak periods or at night, beware of travelling on your own in a carriage. It is better to remain in a carriage with a number of other fellow passengers, assuming these are ordinary law-abiding citizens."},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"If the train is empty , it is advisable to position yourself near the guard’ s van and close to a door .

Do not reveal any valuable items, such as a laptop computer , if suspicious people are around. Keep your briefcase close to you at all times and if it contains valuable items keep a strap round your shoulders to prevent it from being snatched. Beware the possibility of a thief entering a carriage at a station, grabbing a bag from someone and leaving the train again just before the doors close. If you feel that the situation is serious enough to pull the emergency lever , it is recommended that you should do so in a station as this will make it easier for station staf f to intervene. If you are waiting for a train on a platform, similar rules apply . Keep close to any other ordinary people and also keep within lighted areas.

DEFENCE AGAINST A GUN ATTACK If you realise that an assailant is close behind you and is in possession of a gun and you think you’re about to be shot, one technique is to swivel round rapidly with your left arm at your side and sweep aside the assailant’ s gun arm with your left arm as you turn. Follow the move by pushing your right hand up into the assailant’ s chin. Y ou should then either disarm him or quickly make good your escape.
