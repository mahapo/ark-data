There is an eighteen trillion dollar debtand growing, the possibility of a national power grid failure is a real concernand tied to the power grid is the chance of an international terrorist attackand solar flares from the sun, Ebola has become a major concern worldwide andproves a pandemic can quickly become a reality, and the list goes on.The list goes on, but whatever national disaster befalls the country is reallyirrelevant. If food supplies or the distribution of life saving supplies are cutoff, it does not matter what is the cause. There are studies that say if thenational power grid fails for an extended amount of time, 90 percent of thecountry’s population may perish.There are many reasons that these conclusions are a possibility. Let’s look atsome facts, many of which are backed up by studies of past man-made and naturaldisasters. During several major hurricanes (Katrina, Andrew, Sandy, etc.), aswell as many other similar events worldwide, some startling facts weredetermined:• One-third of the population are day shoppers with very little emergencysupplies, if any, to sustain them.• Looting and home invasions will take place, many by armed gangs looking forfood and anything to sustain them. In some past situations looting started whilethe event was still in progress.• Police and emergency services will be disrupted, slow to respond, ornonexistent in certain areas.• Individuals and groups within the populace may find themselves in a life ordeath survival or personal defense situation at any time, very often withoutwarning.With the above four things in mind, ask yourself if you are ready for long-term,or even short-term, personal or family survival, and are you prepared to defendyourself from injury or lethal threat? If the answer is yes, then you areprobably a prepper, survivalist, ex-military, or outdoorsman or -woman who hasthought this out and prepared. I have no official figures, but this mayencompass 10 percent or so of the population. This book is for the other 90percent, or at least those of that population who are concerned and interested.A certain percentage will say nothing is going to happen, and I hope they arecorrect. A certain percentage will be incapable of preparation; these are thedisabled, both physically and mentally, among us. If a long-term disaster shouldoccur, whatever you have at your disposal is what you are going to have tosustain yourself, your family, and the people you choose to help you throughthis dangerous and life-changing situation.Any long-term survivalist or prepper will tell you they probably have been at itfor a long time and it is an ongoing way of life. They will also tell you thereason it is a way of life is that no one knows when it will happen. Disasterhas no schedule; it strikes everyone equally and without warning. Those notprepared for the long term will probably die of starvation, sickness, or as avictim of violence. There are many good survival books out there, and all havegood advice. This one will be no different other than it will advise the familyor group on how to Survive While Surviving. The data on basic survival is atyour fingertips.Why do I say group? Groups are harder to feed than individuals, but individualsin areas where violence is taking place are the first to die. The reasons aresimple: you cannot watch all approaches to your survival location, and youcannot stay awake and functional long. Should disaster strike, everyone will bethrown into the same situation where food, water, fire, shelter, and medicalcare will be the five primary concerns in their lives for as long as thesituation lasts. The recommendations made in this book are not guarantees.Should long-term disaster strike, the survivors will have several things incommon: preparation, luck, a good survival mind-set, a good support group, and apropensity for violence and personal survival. Hopefully, disaster will notstrike, but if it does, it will probably be instant with no warning. Whatpreparation or abilities you have will be all you have to survive the event.This is a different survival manual, which explains what has to take place whileyou are doing everything the other survival manuals teach you. While you willhave to store food properly, purify water, and all the other associated subjectsin the survival field, if disaster strikes long term, you are going to needother thoughts, knowledge, and mind-set. That’s what this book is about. If youthink things are not going to get really rough when more than three hundredmillion people get their food and critical supplies cut off, no book everwritten will help you including this one.I will state it again in the following chapters, but in a long-term survivalsituation if society should collapse, Surviving While Surviving will be ascritical as the ability to find food and water. This is the bottom line thatsurvival books do not cover—or I have not found them. Surviving While Survivingmay be initially confusing to the unprepared, who are only worried about havingenough food and water. Let me throw up a couple of bullet points to get you onboard and thinking. Violence is taking place and people are dying, scared,hungry, and committing violence on other people for what they have.Some Questions to Wake You Up• You are searching for food and water in an abandoned grocery store—who is onguard?• You are asleep—who is on guard?• You are cutting firewood—who is on guard?• You have food and are eating—who is on guard?• You are doing something that requires your full attention—who is on guard?Hopefully you get my point. In situations like what we will be discussing inthis book, if you do not have someone on guard 24/7, you and what you have tosurvive with will not be around long.This book is designed to make you use your head. It has chapters that will tellyou all you have to think about to survive and, most importantly, how to SurviveWhile Surviving. Get used to this term. It will present you with morerequirements for study and training than you will think possible. You will readabout what you need to survive and what you need to do to Survive WhileSurviving. I am going to go out on a limb and estimate that 90 percent of thepeople who read this book will not make the effort required to prepare. The oneswho do make the effort will, in the end, know that all the equipment they haveacquired to survive the event is useless to anyone unless they have the mentalfortitude and toughness to live, survive, and protect themselves whilesurviving.image [../Images/10-1.jpg]Who is on guard while you search an abandoned grocery store? (wwing, courtesy ofiStock)When disaster strikes and people come to kill you for what you have, will you beable to stop them? Will you have the will to win? Will you have developed themind-set to fight while you are hurt, bleeding, and having trouble catching yourbreath? I have friends who are preppers who are doing good things preparing forhard times, but when I question what they are preparing for, I get answers suchas, “When it all ends.” Personally, I am not sure what that means. I do notbelieve the country will fall apart tomorrow, but know that sooner or laterdisaster will strike in some form or another. Being prepared to fend foryourself just makes sense. On my part, that forethought comes from my time inthe army. Nevertheless, the more time you spend preparing for disaster, thebetter you will do. I have friends with no military experience who have plans tobutton down and take on all comers. For those who have never been in a seriousgunfight at close range, you need to realize there are usually casualties onboth sides. At the least, if not hit directly with a bullet, there is a goodchance you will have fragments from bullet jackets, windows, or cinder blockpieces somewhere in you, and some of them may be serious wounds. Attrition inthe group will start at the first serious clash with another armed group. I knowin my heart that a lot of preppers have not fully considered this in theirplanning.How can this happen in America or the world? It may start without warning. Wewake up one day and find the banks are closed and credit cards are not working,the predicted financial collapse is here, and things will start to happen thatno one wants. First it might be in our big cities and population areas and soonthe rest of the country and maybe the world. We may find ourselves fighting forour lives to protect what we have in our homes.If you do not have the internal confidence and personal fortitude to do theabove, it makes no difference how much equipment you have acquired. Someone elseis going to end up with it, and he or she will be the one that kills you becauseyou didn’t have the mental fortitude and capability to stop them. I believe thisbook is what you need to start the journey, but you will not develop the skillsand the will to win by reading it, you are going to have to do the work. Yourlife and the lives of your family or group depend on it. It’s easy to mental up;you have got to put in the time, sweat, and blood, get exhausted in training,and not let anything stop you from getting where you are supposed to go. I donot know how much time we have before disaster strikes—no one does. You willread many things in this book that the average citizen knows nothing about. Whatis recommended here for that part of the population will require hard work inacquiring materials, training, and rehearsal of any plans that are made. I wouldpredict that even some preppers may not fully understand how dire our livescould become. There are no perfect answers in this book, but to the ones whowill read, learn, and do the work required, get going. Now! The clock isticking."},{"pageContent":"Chapter OneSurvival GroupsThere have been a lot of discussions on how big a group should be to ensuretheir survival. The size of the group will always be determined bycircumstances, location, capabilities of individuals within the group, and thegroup’s capability to adapt, sustain, and defend itself. If the group is notlarge enough, it will not be able to meet the survival requirements, and it willperish. The talks on group size will go on until disaster strikes. Unlike mostthings that are known, what we are talking about in this book has not happenedin our country’s history. If you take a realistic look at what may have to bedone to survive after disaster, you will realize a small group is headed foreventual disaster in its own right. This does not mean a large group willsurvive if plagued with bad leadership, poor planning, or members not 100percent dedicated to the group and its survival—in this respect a large groupwill eventually meet its demise.Let’s Look at Location–My Opinion• Groups in rural or remote areas will do well or better than those in cities.• Groups in large cities or population areas will do poorly unless trained andprepared.• Groups who have a remote or rural area to go to will do well if they survivethe trip.• Groups who have prepared for the event will do the best with a little luckwhether they live in a large population center or rural area, but this does notmean they will survive.Note: Well-prepared and equipped groups have a better chance of surviving along-term situation, but if they do not know how to Survive While Surviving,someone else will be eating their food and drinking their water. I can tell youfrom experience that living in a total tactical environment of unending waitingand watching for an attack is hard on trained combat troops. What thing thatmust be done to ensure your security in an open combat environment will be thehardest thing you do both mentally and physically? The very act of planning agathering party to move into hostile areas is a daunting requirement.There are as many ideas on what a group should have regarding capabilities ornumbers as there are discussions on the topic. The thing about groups in mostdisasters is that you may end up with a group that is dictated by circumstances,not choice. Family groups are the first group in most disaster situations, andto keep it simple, we will look at a family group of mom, dad, kids, uncles,aunts, cousins, etc. If you are lucky, within this group will be ex-military,hunters, mechanics, etc. The truth of the matter is that it takes time and workto develop a good cohesive group to be proficient in the situations we will betalking about. The only advice I can give here is try to recruit people withtalents you need, and in giving that advice, I must say this is not the easiestthing to do.The family group is what it is; their ability to survive will be determined bydesire, preparation, training, luck, and location. The bottom line is that iflong-term disaster strikes and you have not prepared, your chance of survivingis greatly diminished. Within the family group, every physical or mentallydisabled person will be a strain. If you take a look at the families in theUnited States with members on life support, taking medications to live, ordisabilities requiring full-time care, you can plainly see where many of thepredicted deaths will come from. One of the principal requirements in anysurvival or combat situation is the requirement to be able to move swiftly andwith purpose. If burdened with wounded or disabled members, that ability isstripped from you and puts you at extreme risk in many survival or combatsituations.The family group will have the strongest bond and be willing to go to theextreme for group members. With a little luck and some in-family talents, thegroup may do well, but again location and preparation is everything. You may beforced to defend yourself daily if you live in a city or large populationcenter. This will prevent or degrade your ability to find food, water, and othermeans of sustainment unless the group is large enough to support the neededefforts. In the large population areas, food and essentials will run outquickly, and defending what you have may quickly become a top priority. As wetalk about the need for daily defense, food, water, warm clothing, and bedding,consider that if it’s winter and heating your location becomes a top priority,it should not be lost on anyone that a two- to ten-person group will not do it.Two to ten people in a location that must be guarded 24/7, have water hauled infrom a distance, and food hunted and processed in sub-zero weather will behard-pressed to find and transport the cords of wood that will be required toget through the winter unless they had the full spring and summer to prepare.Once into a disaster, if you have not prepared, several things of consequencemay take place.• You are going to have to be prepared to defend your location 24/7.• You are going to have to acquire food, water, and materials daily orbiweekly.• You may be forced out of your location by events or violence.• You must have a daily sustenance and tactical contingency plan.• You will have to have a daily sanitation plan.• If forced to move, do you have the capability to move critical survivalitems? If not, what is the plan?Whether your group is family or brought together by circumstances, you will havesome daunting logistical requirements. If the group can maintain and hold itssurvival location, the logistics are fairly simple and generally boil down toacquiring food, water, and sanitation duties. The daily or biweekly acquiring offood and water may be what decides movement from your planned location—or lifeand death—and, depending on what is used or available for transportation, may bea complex problem. This problem will be determined by the availability ofvehicles with gas, how far gathering groups must roam for food and water, andthe overall tactical situation. Before we get into the how and why, we need tolook at group capability and what they have available. Prior preparation herewill save the day; lack of preparation may result in the demise of the group.The following is my take on acquiring enough food and water to sustain thegroup.The logistics of providing food and water will be an ongoing daily effort that,as time goes by, will become more and more difficult. No matter what mode oftransportation is used, the need to provide food and water for the group mayforce a move to a new location. But for now, let’s talk logistics and how we aregoing to do it. Anything can be carried, regardless of weight, if vehicles areavailable. If vehicles are not available, the group has immediate and direlogistical problems. They just stepped back in time a few hundred years orlonger, and transporting any materials may have to be accomplished on the backsof group members.A Few Survival Facts• The area you will have to travel will lengthen as days go by. Withoutvehicles, this will soon become unacceptable and a danger to group survival.• The group will have to secure and defend its location and be prepared totactically defend the gathering party. This means both the location andgathering party must be armed and equipped to take care of themselves. Bothentities must have enough people to accomplish the required tasks.• Depending on how big the group is, they may need many gallons of water perday. Fact: one gallon of water weighs 8.34 pounds, so twenty gallons of waterweighs 166.8 pounds. Even with a cart that’s a load, and we have not talkedabout food and any materials you may want.• If vehicles are not available, gathering parties may be forced to travel fora day or more, which doesn’t account for running into any tactical problemswhile out gathering. This drives the question of how many group members are atthe survival location and if they can have people awake 24/7 for security.• Is it better to gather materials as a group, or are the logistics of hidingor moving your critical items restricting this and pinning you to a fixedsurvival location? If pinned to a location, can it be realistically defendedwith the gathering party gone?The answers to the last two bullet points have to be made by the group. I amsure during large disasters that groups have both survived and perished based onthese decisions. Based on major disaster scenarios and the situation surroundingyour survival location, whatever decision the group makes puts them in the handsof fate, and it is unpredictable whether they will survive or perish. Onlyhistory will note this, and in a national disaster no one may ever know.Groups living in big cities or population areas will initially have primaryproblems to contend with while trying to sustain the group. Roving bands ofhungry, desperate individuals will be looking for anything they can take byforce for their own survival. If the group’s survival location is identified,the chance of finding themselves under constant assault is 100 percent assured.Once found, the situation quickly turns to what you have to defend yourself withand how much of it.In my view, it is a fact that guns and ammunition will be as important as foodand water to ensure your survival. How to defend your survival location andgathering parties will require some tactical knowledge on defense, attack, andkeeping yourself from being injured. In the end, defending your survivallocation will be as time-consuming and logistically challenging as acquiringfood and water, and it can only be accomplished by a well-put-together groupwith the necessary skills and equipment. Keep in mind that if vehicles are notavailable, the more equipment you have, the harder it is to move.No matter how much food and water you initially have, sooner or later you willrun out at your survival location and will have to go looking for it—probably indangerous and unknown situations. The size of the group and what it hasavailable to defend itself will be the difference between success and failure.As stated above, there are many good survival books available, as well as goodsurvival tips on the Internet. What most of these have in common is good adviceon how to survive in remote areas. They have little to no information onsurviving while protecting yourself from roving gangs or looters intent ontaking what you have and maybe killing you in the process.There are magazines that cover survival and home defense available at magazineracks in most grocery stores. They provide valid situational advice, and Irecommend acquiring these and getting read up and trained. The problem withdisaster is no one can predict how much time we have before it strikes. Oncedisaster does strike, everyone is in the same boat in that you are starting yoursurvival career with what you have on hand or can quickly acquire. If you’reready, that’s a very good thing, but if not, you will likely not survive for anylength of time because the cards are stacked against you. I will not get intoany discussions here on the morality or the law of what you can or cannot do todefend yourself, but if society has broken down and there is no law, thedecision to live or die and what you must do is totally up to you.Remember, we are not talking about surviving an earthquake or hurricane. Thattime frame will be days in most cases, and it is fairly safe to say lawenforcement and emergency services will be back in place fairly quickly.However, if in the middle of those three days a group or individual comes tokill you for what they think you have, the next day and a half will mean nothingif you are not prepared to take care of yourself. You may have to deal with somelooters or crazies, and most people, when in groups, are better equipped to dothis. We are talking about a national emergency where society has broken downand the time frame is not weeks but is months or years.If you think of the sick and disabled among us, the elderly, and the men andwomen living alone with no family or support group, the estimates of 90 percentof the population dying may be deadly accurate. Should a long-term situation,with its associated breakdown of society, take place, it will immediately putall citizens into two parallel and unending situations. The first situation willbe true survival with all its associated problems. The second situation will betactical with all the associated protocols of defense, attack, raids, tacticalmovement, ambush, surveillance, and unending group readiness to respond.Keep in mind that if you live in a big city and a national disaster should takeplace, you or your group will be immediately facing well-armed, trained, andexperienced groups with a propensity for extreme violence that we now call drugcartels and street gangs. These groups are already formed and dedicated to thegroups’ survival, and they will be a formidable force for any group of citizensto deal with. At an individual level it will be virtually impossible. Laterchapters will provide some generally suggested lists for survival. Here, weshould discuss group armament and combat survival equipment. In certain areas,especially when moving, the group will be concerned with long-range marksmen orsnipers. In defending the survival location, close range fighting will be thenorm.Regardless of Size, the Group Should Have the Following Personal and DefensiveEquipment• Shotguns, both hunting and combat• M4 or similar assault weapons with scope—not optics that need batteries• Heavy caliber rifles, such as .308, 30/06, etc., with scope—not optics thatneed batteries• .22 semiautomatic rifles for hunting rodents and defense• Personal sidearms, such as 9mm, .40, and .45 calibers, etc.—in a perfectworld the group should all have the same weapons• At least one thousand rounds of ammunition per gun or more—in a long-termsituation you will never have enough ammunition• At least ten magazines per gun that requires them• Binoculars• Flashlights• Two fixed-blade knives per group member• Machetes• Body armor• Ballistic eye protection• Helmets• Elbow and knee pads• Combat harnesses• Utility belts• Rucksacks• Top of the line pellet guns with several cans of pellets, which are quietfor hunting small game• Two canteens per member—more durable and needs less care than a hydro-pack• Water purification tablets• Four to six sets of extreme-use utility or tactical clothing• Good boots• Personal medical kits• Extendable batons• Pepper spray• Hatchets or tomahawks• Bows—either recurve, crossbows, or compound with extra strings and parts andat least fifty arrowsNote: I do not include night vision capability here for the reason that themajority of the population cannot afford it and certainly have more pressingitems to spend their limited funds on. If you can get night vision capability,get it. It can be the difference in winning big and reducing friendly casualtiesin a night fight.As any combat-trained person knows, the above list is not complete, but withinour civilian community if you can start out with this minimum list you’re indecent shape and probably better than most. As you survive the coming combat,you will acquire the equipment of the people you have to deal with. Never win asurvival fight without taking your opponents’ guns, ammunition, packs, and anyother equipment they may have. Keep in mind every fight diminishes yourammunition supply. Never win a fight and leave opponents’ guns and ammunitionwhere they fell. It’s called immediate combat resupply and potential barterequipment.Never forget you are in a long-term survival and tactical situation, and bothmust receive full attention at all times. The list above, even though notcomplete, is logistical weight that you cannot carry in one load. Planning andweapons employment use is fundamental to success. Where are you going, how areyou going to get there, and what equipment do you need? This planning processshould be done every day for movement and survival location defense. For thoseof you who are scratching your head and saying it sounds like this guy is sayingwe are going to war, quit wondering. If disaster strikes, that’s exactly what Iam saying; you will be going to war. At least for the majority who have neverbeen in the military, it will sound and feel like war.image [../Images/20-1.jpg]A hatchet is just one of the personal and defensive equipment that you shouldhave on hand in the case of a disaster. (mediaphotos, courtesy of iStock)Anyone in a survival situation is going to have to travel outside the survivallocation to secure food and water sooner or later. This will put the gatheringparty or individual in constant danger of being attacked and killed. Movement,planning, and the tactics used to support the move must be rehearsed and knownby all. The gathering party must operate in a break contact mode; they cannotafford to get pinned down or in a long sustained fight, as they will not havethe ammunition for this and will quickly deplete what they have stocked. Whenmoving, stay spread out, and no one moves unless covered by someone else. Scanthe direction of the move with binoculars, and have a rear guard watching yourback. In my view, individuals in this situation are operating on borrowed time.It is only a matter of time before their luck runs out and they run into asituation that will get them killed. This is especially true in the big citiesand high-population areas. If you have to fight, do it at a time and place ofyour choosing.If you live in a big city, part of your preparation is to have all survivalequipment in packs and ready to move as soon as you realize disaster has struck.You will also need vehicles that have gas to get out of town to a predeterminedsurvival site or at least a safer rural site to start your survival attempts.Inner cities will become war zones that will quickly deplete your ammunition anddefensive equipment. As in all combat survival situations, the best way tomaintain your ammunition supply is to stay out of a fight or break contactbefore you get sucked into a sustained fight. There are several good tacticsmanuals and schools that teach these tactics, and since we do not know whendisaster will strike, getting some training and range work that will enhanceyour capabilities would be in your best interest. I will discuss some basictactics in a following chapter.As time goes by and food and water become harder to get, the group members willweaken physically. They will not be able to stay as sharp and focused withoutsustenance, so a move to a new location may be in the group’s best interest. Ashunger sets in, anything that can be eaten will be, which includes cats, dogs,birds, rats, worms, etc. All humans have a survival gene within and will sooneror later eat what they would never have considered in good times. I am surepeople reading this book will be looking for good news should disaster on anational scale strike, but I believe there will not be any.Discipline must be enforced whether the group is a family or one put togetherout of necessity by known associates. Group members who become disillusioned,mentally unstable, or in constant disagreement with group decisions are a dangerto the group and should be dealt with quickly. A group that is not totallycohesive and unified will perish. If discipline is not enforced, infighting willeventually break out, and the group will be degraded to ineffectiveness. Harddecisions, especially within family groups, will have to be made. Remember thegrass always looks greener somewhere else when you are disillusioned, but in anational or world disaster you will be moving from one wasteland to another andthere will be no green grass or a better situation. You may find and be acceptedby a different group, but your day-to-day dangers and survival requirements willremain the same.In a functional group within a survival environment, the more democratic thegroup is the better. Keep in mind that in survival and tactical situations,decisions have to be made quickly on a regular basis by the leaders. Everyone inthe group needs to understand this, and this should be part of your preparationprocess. It should also be understood that in most survival and criticaltactical situations, no one will have extra time on their hands. Groups shouldput the most qualified people in charge—not necessarily the best liked. Manyprotocols must be in place to ensure group survival, and here is where the sizeof the group is important. Whether food and water are scarce or plentiful, noone can stay awake and alert for days at a time, but things are going to have totake place 24/7. With this in mind, scheduling who does what and when arecritical. Who is on guard at the survival location, who is with the gatheringparty, who is on guard days, who is on nights, who sleeps and when? Failure toenforce discipline and adherence to the required schedule will eventually be thecause of the group’s fragmentation or demise at the hands of a more organizedgroup.All of the above questions are critical to the group’s survival and areimportant to ensure the group is not surprised in their survival location orwhen out gathering. Having been in tactical situations for most of my life, Ican say confidently that no matter how sharp or how good you are, everyone mustbe doing their job. Situations will arise that you have not planned for, andsome will be a complete surprise and require quick and decisive action tosurvive. Be prepared at all times for disaster to strike the group. For example,the gathering party is ambushed and does not return. This will immediately putthe group into disarray and force them to operate in a greatly diminishedcapacity. If not handled properly, casualties and attrition among group memberswill render the group ineffective. There will always be chances to increasegroup numbers, but be careful whom you pick, and watch them carefully until theyare a proven asset. The chance you made a bad choice is as good a possibility asnot.Gathering parties will be moving constantly and most likely through constantdanger areas. Their movement must be well planned and tactical—no one movesunless covered by someone else. Here is where the poorly trained or untrainedget into trouble because they are generally moving beyond their weapons’capabilities to cover the moving group. To the military or police veteran thisis well known, but to untrained individuals or novices thrown into thesituations we are talking about, this is mostly unknown or confusing. Ipersonally know Army, Navy, and police special operators who can regularly hitwith a combat pistol at one hundred yards. If you are a person who has not spenta career on the range perfecting your skills, the following ranges should beyour plan for supporting moving group members.• Pistols: 25 yards• Shotguns: 00 buck at 25 yards or slugs at 100 yards• M4/M16: 600 yards with training, otherwise 300 yards• .308/7.62: 1000 yards with training, otherwise 600 yards• Hunting rifles: Whatever you are good at—at the farthest range you can hit adeer, you can also hit a person• Bows: Determined by practiceNow, I know all kinds of shooters and commandos will say they can shoot saidweapons farther. I agree, I have done it for more than fifty years, but I havealso been on the range with civilians and will stick to the ranges stated. Noone is going to have ammunition to waste. Unless it is all you have, you shouldnot be using a pistol to support someone moving unless inside a small building.Pistols are for your close-range personal protection and everyone should haveone. Are you going to find yourself in unplanned situations with the terrain ortopography going against you? Count on it, plan and prepare every move, and beprepared for the worst-case scenario. Of course, this is easy for me to say, andeasier said than done.As I stated earlier, this book is not how to get survival food and water ifdisaster strikes. There are hundreds of books, videos, and Internet postings onthe subject, so you can easily get them and training. This book is how toSurvive While Surviving in a worst-case scenario. In my view, if you’re outgathering or processing your urine to drink and someone kills you because you’renot using good tactics or security protocols, what you know about basic survivalbecomes a moot point. The group that is controlling its space and the spacearound them has a good chance of Surviving While Surviving.We talked about guns, but what about ammunition? Fact: You will never haveenough if you have to use it on a daily or regular basis. Never put someone downwhile defending yourself without taking his or her gun and ammunition, andanything else they are carrying is probably useful. In the past, I havegenerally said that for every gun you have, stock at least a thousand rounds.That’s good advice for any problem that may arise, but with what we’re talkingabout, many thousands would be better. As always, it comes down to what you canafford, when you started stocking up, and where you have to store and secure it.The bottom line is that if you have a pistol, shotgun, and assault rifle with athousand rounds each, how are you going to move it without a vehicle? How areyou going to secure it if you have to leave it for any length of time? Manypeople in our population do not even own a vehicle and depend on publictransportation. Vehicles will be easy to get if disaster strikes, but will fuelbe available and will streets be passable if days of rioting occur?No matter what your initial thoughts are regarding what it will take to survivein a long-term situation, it will probably boil down to what you have heard orread. In a survival situation of any length of time, you will need a gun or gunsto take care of yourself and the group. I would suggest you go back and read myweapon and equipment suggestions again. As time goes by and things get morecritical, the group is going to be in a combat situation whether they want it ornot. The group cannot only have a guard shotgun and a gathering party rifle. Asin all combat situations, everyone in the group will need guns. The group needsa good mix of the guns that I recommended, and everyone needs a pistol. Do notkid yourself, things will go to hell quickly, and looters will be outinstantaneously. You only have to look at what happened during Katrina or theRodney King riots. Your group protection protocols and weapons use will be thedifference in any chance of long-term survival. I am not going to preach tocivilians who are set in their ways, and I do not need to preach to the ones whoare preparing and on board with how to handle diverse or dangerous situations. Iwill say there are certain things normal people and good everyday citizens needto know to have any chance of surviving. During a long-term disaster when youhave to fend for yourself, there are several things that will make your chancesof survival better than most.• Physical Fitness—The better shape you are in, the better you will think andbe able to handle what comes at you.• Adaptability—Things are not going to be the way they were, and they aregoing to be constantly changing. The better you are at quickly adapting, thebetter your chances of surviving.• Mental Stability—Think, stay calm, know where you are going, how you aregoing to get there, and what equipment you need to make it happen.• Weapons Proficiency—This includes all children old enough to make a decisionand all other family members who are physically able regardless of age.Long-term survival is a pressure cooker lifestyle, and if you do not have theabove attributes, get some people in the group that do. You will find this iseasier said than done. It does not matter whether the survival group is a familygroup or a group thrown together by the situation, there are several protocolsthat must be strictly enforced for the group to maintain itself and besuccessful. One of these is strong leadership. Having group members withmilitary or police experience is a must in my eyes, but these members may not begood leaders. The selection of leaders and replacing leaders who are not goodleaders must be a group decision and strongpoint. Only time and grouporganization will determine the group’s effectiveness. Group organization shouldfocus on the protocols that have worked in the past with groups in direcircumstances.Successful Group Protocols• There should be group rules, and they should be strictly enforced.• Group hygiene must be a daily event and enforced by leaders.• The group splits all assets equally between members.• Group decisions should be voted on, including leadership positions andrules.• Discipline must be strictly enforced.• When moving outside the survival location, the move must be planned andtactical.• Defense of the survival location must be planned and tactical.• Group members who become detrimental to the group must be dealt withimmediately.• The group should understand that leaders will make the final decisions.It would serve any group best if the above points could be laid out, agreedupon, and incorporated into group training and preparation prior to anydisaster. The reality is that most groups thrown together by circumstances willhave to work them out the hard way and hopefully will survive what will be adifficult and life-changing event. I am sure people reading this book will ask,“Why didn’t he tell us what we need to do?” I say, go back and read the ninebullet points just listed and start getting your group and plan for survivaltogether, as no one knows when disaster will strike. I gave you my take on whereyou need to go, and you have to get yourself there and make your own decisionsas quickly as you can. There are people who are knowledgeable on survival thatsay everyone in the group should not know everything about what is going onwithin the group. I disagree with this because if you can’t trust them whilepreparing, you are in trouble as a group once disaster strikes.I do not have all the answers, and among my military buddies there are differentoutlooks on how to do things—they all have merit, but these are mine. For whatit’s worth, should disaster strike, I am following the advice in this book.Based on my fifty-plus-year career, I believe it will work, and I am willing tostake my life on it in the event of disaster. Serving in the type of units Ihave been in during my career has provided me with vast experience. However,that does not guarantee I will survive in a long-term disaster situation—luck orfate may go against me at the wrong time. That notwithstanding, the time I havespent in combat units and situations does guarantee that I can take care ofmyself and get things organized and functioning while doing it. Again, that doesnot guarantee success, but it raises my chances of success greatly. As statedpreviously, there are no perfect answers and certainly no guarantees.Groups or individuals that live or are trapped by events in large populationcenters or large cities will have to go on full alert to protect what they havefrom looters very shortly after the event. Groups living in rural areas willhave an easier time initially but should stay aware of their surroundings andnot take anything for granted. There has been much written about wealthy peopleand their rural retreats, as well as TV programs about preppers and their stockof supplies and retreats. Among the populace, there will be groups orindividuals who will look to these potential sites as salvation for a time andmay be conducting recon operations on these sites already.No matter where you are when disaster strikes, going on guard and securingyourself should be a first priority to ensure your survival efforts aresuccessful. In the following chapters, we will discuss the differences betweenurban and rural settings and the more successful security measures that can beused when you are completely on your own. No book or training class can coverall that needs to be accomplished and how to accomplish it. This information inthis book will stick with the basics, and hopefully if a national disasterhappens, it is enough to get people who now know nothing about Surviving WhileSurviving to have a good start in developing what will be a must-have programfor them to have any chance of surviving. This book guarantees nothing otherthan giving you a good start; it does not and cannot guarantee you success—onlyluck and how you prepare and conduct your group activities will determine this.As in all combat or high-risk situations, your first mistake may very well beyour last, and this holds true for groups, as well as individuals.Do not think that because you are in a rural or remote setting that you will nothave similar problems to people who live in high-population areas. You shouldnot have them as often or early on, but you will have them. The rural or remotesite, even though removed from the most dangerous areas, still presents its ownproblems for the group using it as a survival site. These problems are enhancedif the area is heavily wooded or mountainous. It will be easy for a group todevelop a false sense of security when in a remote area. All you have to do iswalk outside at night and look up at the sky full of stars and listen. Yougenerally hear nothing, maybe a night bird or coyote, but there is usually totalsilence. It is not hard to convince yourself you are alone in the world. Peoplewho have these sites, especially if they have been there an extended length oftime, should suspect that other people know of their existence. If you take thepercentage of the population who get out of town and head for the hills, many ofthese people being hunters and woodsmen, your remote site may not be remotelong.Everyday Operations That May Give Away the Location of Your Site• Smoke from cooking or warming fires can sometimes be seen or smelled formiles.• Noise from site maintenance will carry long distances.• Talking or yelling will carry long distances.• Gathering or water parties moving about may be seen by anyone in the area.image [../Images/28-1.jpg]Caution! Smoke from cooking or warming fires can sometimes be seen or smelledfor miles. (Dale C. Spartas/http://www.spartasphoto.com[http://www.spartasphoto.com])• People traveling through the area finding a garden or wood-gathering areawill be alerted to the possibility of the site location.• Any dump sites, old or new latrines, or fresh trails will notify anyone toyour possible presence.• Gunshots fired while hunting will attract people from miles away.This list is not complete but hopefully gives you an understanding that you canbe found at any time, whether by accident or by your actions make no difference,and once found, you will most likely have problems. Heavily wooded ormountainous terrain, although good for hiding, also presents the group withproblems once their site is discovered.Problems with Wooded and Mountainous Terrain• The site can be observed without the group detecting the observers.• The site can be approached without detection unless daily guards and patrolsare being used.• An attack can come quickly from close range.• Gathering or water parties can be ambushed easily.• The site can be broken into if the entire group leaves.These points will hopefully drive home the point that even though you are in aremote area, your day-to-day security must be the same as any well-preparedgroup in a city or high-population area. In remote areas, it is easy to developa false sense of security, and this will ensure that eventually your luck willrun out. Group leaders and members should enforce daily security in pre-eventpreparations, as well as 24/7 after disaster strikes and they are in theirremote location. Group leaders must keep on top of their game as far as groupsecurity goes.image [../Images/29-1.jpg]Mountainous areas can be good for hiding, but also present problems once thesite is discovered. (Dale C. Spartas/http://www.spartasphoto.com[http://www.spartasphoto.com])As stated, it will be easy for group members in a remote location to convincethemselves that they are safe and will remain that way, but nothing is furtherfrom the truth. The only good thing about a remote location is that it ishopefully hidden so looters and roving gangs will not be looking at, andpossibly entering, the site daily. In cities, everyone will start looking forfood and materials, and the survival site will be under siege constantly. Thelast thing I want to cover is the group’s use and care of its weapons andammunition management. Group leaders must check individual weapons on a regularbasis, weapons should be maintained on a scheduled basis, cleaning materialsshould be part of the group’s equipment, and ammunition should be kept clean andserviceable. Keep a loaded weapon ready when cleaning other weapons. Have weaponrepair materials on hand—part of your planning should encompass weapon repair orparts replacement.The group should be proficient in reloading and have the appropriate reloadingmaterials on hand. These materials add weight to the group’s mandatory suppliesand will be problematic if vehicles are not available and a move to a newlocation is forced upon the group, but they are worth having. Friends from themilitary and law enforcement who have read this part of the book agree that myrecommendations on weapons are dead on, but some people will say I amexaggerating about what weapons and ammunition should be available. Those peoplehave not seen the myriad of dead I have seen in countries where people withweapons came to kill people who didn’t have them. There is a lot of informationto be thought about and trained on in this chapter, but the military-experiencedwill know this material and be on top of it. For the untrained, however, readcarefully and do what you think you must do to prepare.Security for your preparations must be strictly enforced because the more peoplewho are aware of your operations outside the group, the more chance you have ofbeing burglarized for what you are gathering. You will probably be first on thelooters’ list if word gets out about what you and the group are doing. The moreequipment you acquire, the harder it is going to be to keep it hidden. There areseveral options to maintain group security.Group Security Options• Rotate group meetings at different group members’ houses.• Store equipment in attics, cellars, or rooms without windows.• Rent a storage facility for storing equipment.• The group can rent a small warehouse for trucks and storing equipment.• If a group member lives in a secure location and has the storage facilities,do all group activities there.The above options all have merit. Each group will have different optionsavailable and should operate accordingly. Security of the group’s preparationsshould be the top priority for all members.Pay attention to my next point—your life depends on it!Never bring a knife to a gunfight, but never, ever bring nothing to a gunfight!Keep in mind that the more time available for planning and preparation, thebetter will be your chance of success. Groups must stay realistic in theirapproach to preparation and the expected results of that preparation. Groupinventories of equipment and stores must be made regularly. Acquiring equipmentwithout the ability to move it is discussed throughout this book and shouldnever be overlooked. Disaster potential should always be assessed. If you arestoring your equipment in a structure that could be set on fire, what is theoption? Most times there will not be one, and you are rolling the dice andhoping your structure is not accidentally or purposely set on fire. The furtherassessment is if you lose most or all of your equipment in the disaster, whatare your options and where do you go?"},{"pageContent":"Chapter TwoThe Urban Survival LocationWithin our large cities and urban areas of high populations, there are many tensof thousands of structures, neighborhoods, and business districts withhigh-rises and sprawling industrial areas. Within this infrastructure, tens ofmillions of people are living, and many of them are totally unprepared for adisaster of any kind, much less a catastrophic long-term event with itsassociated breakdown of life-sustaining services and society. Within the citiesaround the country are uncountable one-room apartments that are living space formillions of people. We will begin this chapter with the smallest living spacesoccupied by people. My intent here is to initially list the pros and cons ofthese structures. Many are in multistory buildings with a front door, a backentrance or fire escapes, and one or more stairs to the upper floors. Some ofthese buildings have few windows other than on the front and back side and areeither wood or brick.Pros• They are easily defended by a small group.• With few accesses into the building, the chance of being surprised islimited.• Residents can quickly form a group and share survival supplies.Cons• It is easy to be trapped inside by a small group.• The few accesses into the structure are danger areas subject to ambush whenleaving.• Many citizens who live in these structures are day shoppers who do not havea large amount of food on hand.• If the water is cut off, residents will be forced to leave the structurequickly.• Human waste and garbage will become an immediate problem.This pro and con list is not complete since I have to be careful to not write abook so big and heavy no one could lift it. I will try to describe some of theadditional problems associated with these structures. If the structure is wood,it can easily be burned down. The good news is that looters usually loot firstthen burn down, although arson for arson’s sake should not be ruled out. Thethought of being burned out should be motivation to move early on to a safersite. Some of these structures are in old hotels with opposing or off-set roomson each side of a hallway, but others have two or four apartments at the top ofeach staircase. These structures, whether wood or brick, can be easily defended,as any structure can be fortified and protected by a group. However, afterreading the first chapter, the question should be how much work will it take tofortify it correctly, and is the effort worth it.I suspect many of the people living in these structures will remain unpreparedand, when disaster strikes, will become roving bands of looters out of sheernecessity. If anyone is looking for the politically correct way to saysomething, they will not find it in this book. If the situation we are talkingabout should happen, the first two things to go, as they always do in thesesituations, is political correctness and humanity—somewhere between those twovirtues, most egos take a hike, as well. To readers of this book who cannot geton board with preparing for the most life-changing event imaginable and stick totheir politically correct view, I suggest learning verbal judo. If assaulted bya roving gang of looters, maybe it will work, and I wish you luck. Personally, Iwill stick to the list of suggested weapons in this chapter, along withdedicated preparation and group organization.Another drawback of wooden structures is that they have drywall construction,and any bullets fired will generally go through the entire structure. There islittle to no cover, and even if you have a narrow hallway that no one can forcebecause you have it covered, you can still be hit by return fire coming throughthe wall or door. Cinder block walls are a little better cover in that mostpistol rounds will be ineffective when impacting them. Heavy caliber riflerounds, on the other hand, will zip right through the cinder block unless thevoids are filled with concrete. Another detriment to interior drywallconstruction is looters, or people who don’t have your best interests at heart,will not have to force the hallway you are covering or even expose themselves toyour fire. With as little effort as a few kicks, they can go through the walland move room to room—they only have to gain access to the room at the end ofthe hall. This technique is not a secret; burglars and looters have done it inalmost every disaster or civil unrest situation that has ever happened.Even with cinder blocks, if looters have sledgehammers or similar equipment—andthere will probably be a lot of it lying around—they can get a man-sized hole ina wall fairly quickly. It won’t take much thinking to prove these types ofstructures are probably not where you should put your survival location. Insaying that, I know if disaster strikes, millions of people will be forced bycircumstances to start their survival efforts from these structures. So what canthey do to prepare? Before disaster strikes it will be difficult becauselandlords and property owners will not entertain what has to be done to fortifythe structure. We live in good times in a fairly protected society, and almostno one who is not already preparing will want to hear your concerns. As anexample, if anyone had made public statements the day before 9/11 that planeswere going to fly into the World Trade Center and bring the towers down, thereis a good chance the authorities would have had him or her under psychiatricobservation at a medical facility when the planes did hit.So let’s look at a few things we can do to harden our forced survival site inthe types of structures we are now discussing. In the military, there wereseveral instances where we had to fortify wooden structures or Quonset hut–stylebuildings. The military’s answer to this was to bring in heavy equipment andplow up a berm of dirt around the building or fill a couple thousand sandbagsand build a double or triple thick wall high enough so people standing up insaid building could not be hit by direct small-arms fire. With unlimitedequipment and soldiers, this was routinely done, but this is not going to happenin any town in downtown USA. Sandbags are fairly easy to come by, and you canbuy bundles of them anytime you need them. With that being said, let’s take aquick look at logistics.If you live two or three floors up, you are not going to encase your building insandbags, as it would take many thousands of bags and tons of sand or dirt.Fortifying the corners of the room would get it down to a hundred bags or so,which is still hundreds of pounds of sand and a daunting task for an upstairsdweller, but it is possible. Questions will arise from city dwellers as to whereto get the sand. You may have to travel outside the city and find the rightplace, and you will need a vehicle and some help. If built correctly, waist-highand three deep will stop most rounds being fired through the wall and put you incommand of the room. Even limiting bag numbers, this is logistically heavy andwill take time. Another way would be to box the corners with several thicknessesof four-by-fours. This will be much less weight and still provide limitedprotection from gunfire. It’s not perfect, but it’s at least a little cover.Some furniture will stop pistol rounds and light rifle rounds. These are heavycouches with foldup beds, cast iron stoves, and any heavy wooden tables. Again,this is not perfect but better than nothing.Many doors into these structures are lightweight hollow-core or particle-filleddoors. These can usually be kicked in quickly for immediate entry by looters.Doors should be solid wood or metal and steel. Security doors are better butmust be in reinforced jambs. Doors with burglar bars attached with a recessedslot in the floor are a good deterrent to quick entry but do not guarantee thatlooters or others will not get in. You must have obstacles to entry that canquickly be removed from your side in the event building evacuation becomes animmediate necessity. Any obstacles you design or build will not keep anyone outforever, but they will slow them down to where you should have no troublehitting them with some well-aimed fire. That’s how all obstacles are—they willnot stop a determined effort to get in, but they will slow the intruders down sothey can be engaged. All obstacles should be covered by good firing positionseither inside the structure or outside. Firing positions on the outside shouldalways be covered from inside. In a perfect world, no one should be out of sightand everyone should be covered.Overall, the structures we are discussing are not well suited for permanentdefense; there are just too many ways dedicated looters with a little experienceof their own can pin you down and kill or trap you inside to where you cannotescape. I suggest anyone living in these types of structures have a plannedplace to go to that is more defensible and gives you a better chance ofsurvival. This is no easy feat in the inner cities. It’s going to get violentquickly once a disaster strikes on a national scale. In the early daysespecially, there will be no good news once panic sets in. People who haveprepared and are mentally and physically able to accept reality and adapt to itwill do the best. Two other problem areas in these types of structures areelevator shafts and roof access. Elevator shafts can be climbed and are anaccess that must be barricaded or under gun by the survival location team. Ifthe roof can be accessed from adjoining buildings or fire escapes, you haveanother access to the building. The survival group that has to defend thesestructures safely will most likely be in a situation that requires everyoneliving in the building to be effective. Remember as a general rule, he who holdsthe high ground is in the dominant position. This is generally true in large orhigh-rise building defense.As I write this, I doubt that the population that lives in these structures isadequately armed and equipped. Many are day shoppers and few have prepared foranything resembling a disaster. If you have the ability, do a tacticalassessment of your survival location and the capabilities of the group. You maydetermine that a move to a new location is a good idea. That assessment willprobably be correct, but it will also put major logistical requirements on thegroup in finding a new location, especially before disaster strikes, and thenmoving everything to it. This, again, will be easily accomplished if there arerunning vehicles with gas. If there are no vehicles available or roads areblocked by checkpoints or rubble, the group will have to make some harddecisions, detailed plans, and then execute and guard the move to the newlocation by whatever means available. There is no good advice here, as peopleand groups will find themselves in a myriad of situations and will have to dealwith them with assets at hand.Let’s get back to survival locations. We have been talking about single- ordouble-room walk-ups and their associated problems as a survival location.Stepping up to wealthier apartments with multiple rooms does not necessarilymean you have a better deal. Of course you can store more food, water, andsupplies, but on the other side of the equation, you still have the same andpossibly larger security problems. In securing these apartments as survivallocations, you still have the tactical problems of the single- or double-roomwalk-up.Problems with Apartments• Hallways• Elevators• Stairways• Walls that won’t stop bullets• The need to fortify corners or dominating areas in the apartment• Roof accesses• Through-wall access in the case of drywall construction• Human waste and garbage become an immediate problemDoorways will be the first attempt by looters or raiders to access thestructure. In upper-end apartments, the doors are usually stronger solid wood,metal, or steel and can easily be made into a harder entry by barricading. Thisnever guarantees stopping anyone permanently, but it should slow them down, giveearly warning, and hold them outside for a period of time so gunfire can bedelivered if needed to defend your survival location. Remember, for everythinggained, something else may be lost. Where the single-room walk-up may require asmall group to safeguard the location, the bigger and more complex the apartmentor building, the more people will be needed to safeguard it, especially on theground floor. This means more equipment, food, water, and other essentials willbe needed to sustain the group, and any forced move will be more complicated ordisastrous. These decisions will have to be group decisions. In the case ofsmaller structures and smaller groups, fatigue will be a problem, as willreacting to multiple problems.Even though your group is in an upper-class building with more rooms andcapabilities, the group is still going to have to send out gathering parties.The group will be faced with the reality of having to negotiate the samehallways, stairways, and limited exits from the building. The chance of beingeasily trapped in the building or ambushed while coming or going by any outsidearmed group of looters is very real. There will be one thing going for peopletrapped by other groups, and that is in a dire survival situation, the lootersmay not be able to hold the surrounding ground long before they have to go findfood and water themselves. One thing every group should do is ration foodimmediately when disaster strikes. Eat the perishable stuff before it spoils,but do not try to maintain regular meals. If you do not know the extent of thedisaster and how long you or the group will have to survive, start rationingimmediately.I think that even in a national emergency, some things will continue to work atleast for a while. I said I am not going to waste time repeating the hundreds ofredundant survival lists that are already available, but I recommend that whenpower is lost, everyone—group or individual—should have a solar-poweredemergency radio to get any information being broadcast on conditions and futureplans. There are also hand-cranked radios, which I prefer, and I suggest havingtwo or three of these small extremely cheap lifesavers. I guarantee if you onlyhave one, the village idiot or a four-year-old doing what they do will break itand put you out of whatever communications may be available. Thosecommunications could be the difference between life and death or, moreimportantly, hope and mental well-being.Any type of inner fortifications you build will be just as much of a logisticalproblem or even more than for a smaller apartment. No one here is exempt; itmust be a group effort, and it will take time. I will go out on a limb here andsay if you try fortifying before disaster, you are going to have issues withlandlords, neighbors, police, utility personnel, and probably all of the above.It is also a given that in the event of a true national disaster, all theseproblems associated with doing it before will disappear and be immediatelyreplaced by the necessity to survive. Do not forget that the reason for thisbook is to teach the untrained to think. While gathering materials to fortifyyour survival location, you will be in a dangerous environment. Gatheringparties will have to maintain guard while gathering, and the survival locationwill have to be protected. Also keep in mind that we are talking about a truenational disaster. If it’s a local disaster that is going to be stabilized in afew days or so, you may lose a little sleep and have to fire your shotgun acouple times to make looters find an easier target, but in the end you will mostlikely be okay.Let’s move up to the individual residence in a highly populated area. There aretens of millions of these nationally of all shapes and sizes, and surroundingareas range from small city lots to several-acre pieces of property. Some ofthese structures are easily defendable, but some are not, either due toconstruction or location. In any event, the groups or families living in thesestructures should have a plan if they have to abandon the location due tocircumstances. The plan should be the standard that you will see throughout thisbook of where am I going, how am I getting there, and what equipment do I needto be successful.On private lots, no matter the size, take a look first at approaches into yoursurvival location. Most yards in housing complexes mirror each other, were builtby the same contractor, and have the same type and amount of foliage, sidewalks,driveways, street widths, and windows and doors to observe, shoot out of, egressthe structure, barricade, and defend. With this being said, look out each windowand determine, if things were to go as bad as we are discussing, what neighbors’houses would present a problem for you if they were occupied by someone shootingat you. Your first decision is, if you have walls that bullets can zip rightthrough, where do you have to harden up? Where will you most likely have toshoot out of your windows or doors? A simple but expensive hardening of yourhouse is to make the exterior double red or gray brick. This looks good, isacceptable to your neighbors or housing authority, and will stop most bulletsfired at your house. Remember I said most, not all.Once you have this plan down, the next and closer problem is foliage on theproperty. You do not want concealed firing positions that can engage you bysurprise at a close, accurate range or approach routes that come right up to thestructure’s outside walls. The bottom line is if it all crashes and your groupis in survival mode, those beautiful hedges and rose bushes you have beenworking on may need to be taken down to ground level. From a tactical standpointand personal experience, I can tell you without reservation that people with nocover or concealment are a lot easier to hit than those who are concealed. Inthe long run, it saves invaluable ammunition that you are going to need later.Keep in mind that if you live in a state where winters are cold, any trees orlarge bushes you cut down should be cut up for winter firewood. When cutting upfirewood, make sure some group members are watching the surrounding area toensure you are not attacked by surprise.Firewood should be stored where it can be protected and not in a place where itprovides cover and a firing position for looters or groups that are on the prowlfor anything that is easy to get. Once again, it is a 24/7 job of controllingyour space and the space around you—always secure yourself or pay the price.Once you have cleared the area of foliage and have picked the best firingpositions to defend those approaches into your survival location, the unendingguard and observation of those areas becomes a full-time job. Failure to do thismay result in the quick destruction of the group and the looting of the survivalsite.The group should pick a survival location rally point in the event the group forwhatever reason cannot successfully defend the site. If it is determined that anevacuation is required, a point should be picked that is out of sight from thesurvival location and maybe, depending on the density of buildings, should beseveral blocks away. Every group member should know where this location is andbe able to get there in the dark. The group should have a group recognition codeor, in military terms, a running password so members arriving in the dark can beeasily identified. If things go as planned, there is still a chance some groupor family members may become separated during the evacuation, especially in thedark.As previously discussed, sandbags and timbers, such as four-by-fours, can beused for cover. If you do not have bullet-stopping walls, cut firewood of a goodsize stacked inside at the right locations does two things for you: it gives alittle more ballistic protection and puts firewood inside, where you do not haveto go outside and expose yourself to get it. The problem here is if it’s cold,you are burning your enhanced ballistic protection. Group members protecting thesurvival location should be using binoculars and, in a perfect world, havescopes on their rifles. The survival location should have an emergency plan thatsends everyone to defensive positions if the location is approached or attacked.If you have a survival location that is on a slab, another good technique is tocut a three-by-three-foot hole in the floor of the center of each room, or whereyou can best cover the windows and door.Once you have exposed the slab, you are looking at eight to ten inches ofconcrete. Cut a hole of the same size in the concrete. This is best done withpower tools before the power goes out. Once you have exposed the dirt under theconcrete, dig a chest-deep hole that you and group members who are securingother rooms can fight out of and get their heads below ground. With thesepositions, it does not matter if you do not have bullet-stopping walls. You willsurprise anyone coming through a door or window.Again, this is best done with the power on and using impact chisels to getthrough the concrete. If you own your own house and are preparing for the worst,it is a simple carpentry task to make a wooden cover for the fighting position.You can then redo your floors, and when the power goes off and things get bad,it’s a simple matter of tearing up your carpet, wood, or tile floor. I know acouple of preppers who have done this, and no one knows the positions are there.Taking this step will provide you with enhanced security if your survival siteis attacked. Bullet-stopping walls are still a good idea, as you will observe,as most probably shoot out of windows to defend the location.Do not forget that windows are also an entrance into your location and need tobe barricaded, especially on the ground floor. Many ground floor windows incities have security screens or bars already on them. In brick or stonebuildings, if you had to protect yourself, you have bullet-stopping walls andeasily defended windows. Along with what we have already discussed to this pointand will continue to talk about, you are working on hardening your urbansurvival site to have a chance of defending it without becoming an immediatecasualty.There will be people who say that preparation like we are discussing is over thetop and paranoid. They may be right, but if you do not prepare for long-termdisaster and it strikes, you may spend part of the time you have left to livetelling yourself how stupid you were for not doing it. Either way it goes, ifyou take these steps you have given yourself and your group some enhancedsurvival capability. However, if you get run out of the site by extremecircumstances, someone else may benefit from your work. There are no goodanswers here and of course no guarantees.Although it is a necessity to fortify your survival location, all fortificationscan be penetrated. However, they will slow attackers down so they can be firedon more easily. There are a few things that can be added to the equation thatcome under the heading of booby traps. In the military, there are numerousdevices that are made commercially for different applications. These will not beavailable to the general public in a survival situation, but there are a coupleof easy options known to narcotics dealers and other paranoid persons that wouldbe good in a survival situation where defense of your location and well-being isimportant. The first is spike boards that can be placed indoors or outdoorsalong suspected approach routes. They are simply made by driving nails through awooden board and placing them in areas you want to restrict or make difficultfor approach on foot. The second easy trap is hanging fish hooks at chest levelin hallways, doorways, and windows. The best are treble hooks that have threeprongs. Hang them with fishing line, cord, or steel wire. These will definitelyslow anyone down, but the group must remember where they are so friendlies donot run into them by mistake. I do not joke here—around the world in the fighton terror the number of bad guys who have blown themselves up making bombs orrunning into their own booby traps is in the hundreds if not thousands over theyears.Another technique of ambushing people trying to enter your survival location isto build raised platforms above your corner positions and doorways where you canposition yourself just below ceiling level. People entering structures againstother armed people are seldom looking up. Their concern is rightfully lookinginto the room for armed defenders. The previously discussed dug-in floorpositions and raised fighting positions will catch most, if not all, looters bysurprise and put you in tactical control. Quick accurate fire is required here,so do your range work while you still have time.These corner positions are easily built with lumber and a few carpentry skills.Once concealing bushes and sheds have been cleared out of the yard to exposeapproaches to your location and the discussed work on the structure’s corners,floors, and walls have been completed, you will have a fairly hardened, easilydefendable survival location. It must be understood that the site will only beas effective as the people manning it. Even with good people, if the gatheringparties are not finding food and water, a forced move from your picked site maybe mandatory to keep the group from becoming ineffective due to lack ofsustenance. This will be a hard decision that strains the capability of thegroup. The act of moving critical survival equipment may be a daunting task ifvehicles are not available. There are numerous things that impact the survivalsituation if a move from the chosen location is forced by circumstances. Thebiggest one is if vehicles are not available, how are you going to move what maybe a ton or more of critical equipment? Dollies, garden carts, handcarts,wheelbarrows, and the like would be needed. Most group members will be pushingor pulling some type of wheeled device, but some members will be required toguard the move. The move should be intelligently planned and rehearsed usingthese points:• Where are you going?• How are you going to get there?• What equipment do you need?Keep in mind that just about all decisions that may have to be made in along-term survival situation will be life or death decisions. Some may need tobe made quickly, including the decision to move from the survival location, andthe group may not have the capability to move everything they need. Insituations like this, the stronger the group is emotionally and the closer theindividual ties are within the group, the better the chance of making the rightdecision without fragmenting the group into infighting that will quickly destroyany chance of group or individual survival. No one can predict what situationswill confront the group and what effect it will have on them. The longer a groupis together and the more it prepares and trains, the better it will be whenthings go bad.I think a little information on group and individual sanitation is warranted.Human waste and any garbage will quickly become a serious problem no matter thesize of the survival location. Rule one should be no garbage or human wasteallowed left in the structure. The military digs latrines, which are deep holesin the ground with a structure over them and seats to do your business. Whenthey are full, lime is put over the waste, the hole is filled, and a new one isbuilt. If the ground is too hard to dig, cut-off barrels are used under theseats and the waste is burned daily by pouring diesel fuel over it. Some hikersand backpackers dig a small hole to do their business and then cover it up. Inmost FEMA and short-term disasters or functions, such as sporting events orconstruction sites, porta-potties are used. The reason for all these is theprevention of disease. If not done correctly in the survival location, it willnot matter how well you are equipped and trained once sickness sets in anddecimates the group. A latrine should be dug for the survival location, andwhether in a rural or remote location, it should be a minimum of one hundredfeet away—and two hundred would be better. The group should monitor this, andall group members should use it. As in the old days, you will find this excitingin the winter months.In a survival situation like we are discussing, a latrine away from the survivallocation due to a lack of water becomes an easy ambush position for looters whodiscover it. All garbage should be burned to kill germs. This helps sitesanitation but will attract looters or raiders. Nothing should be left to fate;everything should be planned and rehearsed. Even with plans being rehearsed, youshould be prepared for failure or if you find in the middle of the event thatthey are incomplete. Hopefully, rehearsal will show these deficiencies. Nothingis for sure in these situations, but the stronger the bond between groupmembers, the better chance of success. Never prejudge how a plan is going tocome out.I have used the term looters or raiders, and I am sure people reading this willask, “Aren’t these the same?” In my mind they are two different groups.• Looters: Will attack your location for the purpose of getting what you haveand taking it back to their survival location.• Raiders: Will attack your location with the intent of making it their own.Let’s talk about water or the lack of. If there is water, there will be noissues. If there is no quick water available, especially in the summer, allurine should be saved and put into solar stills to provide drinking water. Solarstills require a hole dug into the ground in an area that gets full, all-daysun, a sheet of plastic, a rock to weigh down the plastic, and a container tocatch the purified water. They must be exposed to the sun for the majority ofthe day, so make sure you check on a sunny day to ensure you are putting thestill in the right place. There should be a still for each group member, asstills do not provide a lot of water. There are numerous websites explainingthis simple device and survival schools that teach how to fabricate it. Findinga good place to dig these in an urban area may be difficult. Some people say youcan just drink your own urine in an emergency, and they are right, but this onlyworks for a short time. When you discharge urine, it is full of waste that runsthe range of calcium, potassium, sodium, some undigested alcohol, and more. Theproblem with these chemicals is that your kidneys got rid of them for a reason,so if you drink unpurified urine for the long term you will get sick. Medicalhelp may be nonexistent, so that is not in your best interest.As people read this book there will be those who say, “No way am I doing that,it will be too much trouble.” I have no issues with that thought, but I stronglybelieve that type of thinking in the situation we are talking about will quicklybe your demise. Decisions made or not made are options all humans have—whateveroption anyone chooses is okay with me as long as it does not affect my personalor group survival. This chapter covers urban survival locations, but I willoccasionally insert things as I think about them even though they may not haveanything to do with the chapter. Most, such as sanitation, will affect allsurvival locations and are generally good advice.In all cities and most high-population centers, there are a myriad of commercialand government buildings that are usually of brick or stone construction,possibly with steel or metal doors and very good security bars over the windows.At best they have bullet-stopping walls and are easier to barricade againstentry. On the down side, they are large, and even when a group occupies them asa survival location, there is a possibility the building could be enteredwithout the group knowing, and an attack could be launched on the group fromclose range. On the up side, these structures are usually filled with equipmentor heavy-duty furniture that will allow a group to pick a good place in thebuilding to fortify to the extreme. These large structures are generallysurrounded by wide streets and parking lots, which makes defense of the siteeasy in some instances. These structures are also ideal for an individual orsmall group to hide in for a short amount of time. Long-term hiding may bepossible, but if it’s cold and a fire is needed or moving about for gatheringfood or water is a necessity, sooner or later you will attract attention fromsomeone who does not have your best interests at heart.If using one of these larger structures, the protocols for sanitation and groupcleanliness do not change. The failure to pay proper attention to sanitation andhygiene will invariably result in disaster. There are commercial areas in allcities where the buildings are sheet steel or corrugated metal; these are notbullet-stopping walls. In these older areas, streets and alleys are narrow andempty lots are overgrown. The only reason to enter these areas would be lookingfor warehouses that may have something useful left in them or abandoned vehiclesthat may provide additional survival materials, such as gas, diesel, or oil forlubricating weapons or starting fires. They may also provide good sites forcaches of needed equipment.In dangerous survival situations, people act differently when it comes to wherethey feel safe from their fears or whatever is after them. Some will seek thehighest floor of a multistory building, others will feel more comfortable on theground floor, and others will seek the basement or nearest accessible sewer. Ihave seen this in many countries and situations where danger threatened people.Wherever you decide to go, an assessment should be made on what choices areavailable to you and the consequences of any given area.Consequences of Different Locations• If I go high: Can I be easily trapped, can I escape without going down, do Ihave the capability to outlast a siege, and what are my tactical options?• If I stay at ground level: Can I be easily trapped, can I escape by goingup, can I be attacked from close range, can I outlast a siege, and what are mytactical options?• If I go low or underground: What are my tactical options, and what was Ithinking? Cellars and most underground areas sooner or later become traps withno option for escape.Remember, you are in two parallel 24/7 situations: one is survival and the otheris tactical. It generally holds true that no matter what the situation, therewill be good people in any urban area who may want to join the group. Groupleaders will have to make decisions on whom to trust to help the group survive.Hard choices will have to be made when dealing with people, as there may begroups bartering for anything that might be trusted, there may be people whowant to join a group to enhance their chances of survival, and there will bepeople who will try to join the group to betray it. There will be no easy orclear decisions. At the end of the day, the group’s protection and survivabilityshould be the driving force behind all decisions, and leaders and group membersalike should never forget that all circumstances are tactical situations.Whatever decision is made, the group will live or die by it, as have numerousgroups caught in war or survival situations throughout history.It is hard to live that way, but it generally keeps you alive and in the game.Everything we have talked about will become harder and harder once weakness fromlack of food or water sets in. Once people start becoming lethargic and havetrouble focusing or staying awake, bad things are in their future. If the urbanarea is not providing what is needed to survive, the decision to move or leaveit entirely must be made before the group becomes too weak to function. There isno guarantee that moving will be successful, but you may have a better chance offinding needed food and water. You have no chance sitting around feeling sorryfor yourself while waiting to die.When moving in an urban area—whether you are gathering, moving out of the area,or moving through it—everyone should be on alert. As stated, no one moves unlesscovered by someone else. Moves are planned, and even if the group is pushinghandcarts or the like, moves are made from cover to cover. A rear guard shouldbe used, and everyone should be using binoculars. The chance of an ambush fromany point is a distinct possibility in any urban area. Groups cannot get into astandoff fight, as this will quickly deplete their ammunition and ability tosuccessfully defend themselves. Prior preparation and range work that willenable you to accurately engage targets is mandatory to success. In large urbanareas, you may be fired on from one of thousands of windows and not be able toidentify where the fire is coming from. If so, get out of the area as quickly aspossible.This book, as well as other survival books and schools that are readilyavailable, teaches you how to prepare for a long-term disaster, but it is yourresponsibility to get it done. I have been asked why I do not start a school toinstruct what is in this book, and the simple answer is that I am too old and mybad attitude is getting worse. Keep in mind that no book will get the group towork well together over varied terrain and situations. You are going to have toget out and train, get your hands dirty, and sweat and bleed a little because ifyou only read books, survival will not be in your future. Like anything else inlife you are going to have to do the work to be successful.In heavily populated areas, there will be a lot of movement as people and groupslook for food and water. If your survival location is in an area where there isa lot of activity, the group members who are on guard should be watching to warnthe group of impending problems. If, for instance, you see an armed group makinga tactical move on your survival site, they probably do not have your bestinterests in mind. However, it is possible they are just being careful, as Ihave previously recommended. The group needs to have contact rules for the site.The best way to determine a group’s intentions is to put up warning signs andthen verbally challenge their approach. If a bullet flies by your head, they aremost likely not friendly.The warning sign should say something along the lines of IF YOU PASS THIS SIGNWITHOUT VERBAL PERMISSION YOU WILL BE SHOT. Once verbal communication is made,have one of the group come forward without his or her weapons. Watch what therest of the group does while this is taking place. Hard decisions will have tobe made here. No one will ever know for sure what contact with other groups willbring until that contact is made. The group that has good security protocols andknows its area well should be successful. Never let an unknown group that isnumerically superior to your group into the survival site. They stay outside, gotheir own way, or the fight is on.No matter what the situation, contact with other groups or individuals will takeplace, and in the early days of an event it will probably be quite frequently.Keep in mind that bartering will be taking place, and there may be somesemblance of organization. Neighbors may be helping neighbors, and this would begood and will enhance everyone’s chance of survival. On the other hand, groupswho are shooting at your survival location are definitely not your friends, andyou should act accordingly. I hope that if disaster strikes, people will pulltogether, assist each other, and put up a united front against looters andraiders. In some areas, I am sure that will happen, but in others I am sureanarchy will reign.In both areas, the groups and individuals who have thought this out and areprepared will do the best. No one can say what the end results will be if anational disaster strikes. Only history will record this. In an urbanenvironment, an attack can come from any quarter. Some of the hardest fightingthe military does is in cities; casualties are regular and common withammunition expenditures being extremely high. Any attack directly on thesurvival location will be supported from the nearest surrounding buildings. Therange to these buildings should be known, and the proper weapons must be inplace to engage them in the event of attack.The group will not have and cannot expend the ammunition that the military does.Do not shoot to feel good—wait until you have a target to hit. Ammunitionmanagement must be a group strongpoint and something leaders enforce. This iseasier said than done with untrained group members, but the reality is that justbecause someone is firing at you, there is no requirement to waste ammunitionfiring back. If you are protected by bullet-stopping walls or fighting positionsand are not being directly attacked by people moving on your position, let theother side shoot and waste their ammunition. Wait until you are moved on andhave exposed targets to hit. Do not waste ammunition by shooting back andhitting nothing; this is ammunition you will regret not having later. Make nomistake, you must train to get people to do this. Experienced fighters do this,but most of them have years of training and combat experience.In all urban areas, there are buildings with shelters, safe rooms, panic rooms,or barricaded spaces where people that are threatened go to hide. These workfairly well if a call can be made and the police respond to deal with theproblem. In situations discussed in this book, these safe areas will becomeplaces where you are trapped. With time, and there will be plenty in a long-termdisaster situation, looters or raiders who find these safe areas will have allthe time they need to break into them with any tools they may acquire. If it wasmade by man, it can be destroyed by man. It will depend on how much time theywant to take to get it done. With that being said, there are upper-end saferooms that can only be afforded by the wealthy. These have armored andblast-proof walls and doors, are brilliantly concealed, are stocked with foodand water, have bathrooms and weapons, can emit smoke and gas, havebattery-powered cameras to observe outside, and would take a wrecking crew withequipment to get into.I have talked about defending your survival site in the city or suburbs and alittle about moving around in your surrounding area and the requirements toprotect yourself and the group. Now let’s talk about what may happen in whattime frame and how it will impact everyone in the area. I have no idea what willinitiate a national disaster, but with the national power grid in the news as apossible disaster, I will use that as an example.We have some models if we look at regional power outages that happened on theEast Coast in 1965 and 1977. Since we are discussing urban areas, we will useNew York City as our example.1965: In 1965, a major blackout affected the states of Connecticut,Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont, New York, and New Jersey,along with the province of Ontario, Canada. It struck thirty million peopleliving in an eighty-thousand-square-mile area without warning. In New York Cityat the end of the night of the blackout, five cases of looting were reported.Those incidents were the only reported problems due to the blackout. The usualdaily crimes reported were actually the lowest crime rates recorded since thecity was keeping records. In this instance, there were no issues, emergencyservices continued to function and respond to calls, and people went about theirbusiness in the dark. Power was restored the next day. I believe that if theblackout had lasted longer, people would have continued to pull together andthings would have been okay until critical supplies were interrupted.1977: On July 13 at 8:37 p.m., a blackout hit the New York City power grid.Unlike in 1965, within an hour of power going out, major looting began to takeplace. Along with the looting came arson, and fires began to burn in severalparts of the city. Emergency rooms saw the initial trickle of injuries thatwould turn into a flood of the injured. These early actions by looters strainedthe on-duty watch, and the police department put out an all-hands-on-deck callthat initiated a department-wide callout.Compounding the issues, communications were spotty, and phones were not workingfor the most part. Within the city, four thousand people had to be evacuatedfrom subway tunnels. Additionally, all automobile tunnels into the city wereclosed due to carbon monoxide levels that could not be vented with theelectricity out. LaGuardia and JFK airports were shut down. With officersresponding to the all-hands call, police began making arrests, which would totalmore than four thousand by the end of the night. Once the arrest of lootersbegan, serious street combat between police and looters turned the trickle ofcasualties in emergency rooms into a flood, which included more than fivehundred police officers injured in the event. Looters also added to the count asthey fought amongst themselves to steal what had already been stolen.By the end of the night, more than sixteen hundred stores were looted with manybeing burned. The New York Fire Department responded to more than one thousandfires. Studies of these two events suggest that because the 1965 event startedin the day when people were at work, the violence of 1977 was averted.Without communications in an event like the 1977 blackout in New York, lootingand street violence might be happening in your immediate area. You mightperceive it to be a nationwide event, so you might decide to get out of town andhead for your rural site if you have one. In that case, you would quickly getthe word that everything was over and you could go home.image [../Images/51-1.jpg]In 1977, a blackout in New York City led to major looting of stores such as theone pictured here. (AP Photo/Ed Bailey)Let’s look at another incident in an urban area. The power went out, along withcommunications, during the Rodney King riots. Everyone knows what caused thatincident, but I am using the statistics of that event to put your mind intothinking gear. I will not comment on the riots—just the results of whathappened.The End Result• They lasted six days.• 11,000+ arrests were made.• 2,000+ were injured.• 53 deaths resulted, 10 of those shot by police or military.• 1,100 buildings were destroyed.• 3,600 fires were set.• 3,500 National Guard, Army, and Marines were deployed to assist LAPD.All other law enforcement agencies, whether state or federal, were on the streetassisting local authorities during the incident.If the lights and communications are out and the equivalent of the Rodney Kingriots is taking place to make your city look like a war zone, do you make themove or not? Some people likely would. If I were leading a group, I wouldcertainly move out of the city, but I would stop at the first secure location Icould find outside the war zone to get information.Keep in mind that in both of the described incidents of violence, the governmentand emergency services were working and the government was functional.Certainly, emergency vehicles would be up and down the roads, as well as othervehicles, so I would hold until I got information from somebody that said if Ishould go or stay.This is a hard group decision. As previously discussed, if cities along yourroute are having trouble, you may have to go use an alternate route. Ifcircumstances are really bad, you may need to start your survival right whereyou happen to be. Nothing is assured, so have a backup plan and a backup planfor your backup plan. If it is a true national disaster and you have informationthat it is, get going quickly before your movement routes are blocked. No onecan predict what is going to happen—I wish I could. But even in the worst ofnational disasters, there will be areas of calm with people pulling together andlocal governments functioning. If the group can make it to one of those areas,the chance of survival will be enhanced. I base what I have said in this chapteron what I have seen in my career. The line between civilization and anarchy isthin, and you only need to read history to realize that fact has been provenover any other.If you stay in an urban area as your survival location, I would suspect that ifthings turned to violence, the streets would quickly become cluttered withvehicles and wreckage. Moving through them will be difficult if you are invehicles. Another thing, among the myriad of things that need to be planned for,is multiple flat tires from running over debris. At this point, going to a tireshop for repairs may not be possible, so add to your list of stores severalspare tires for every vehicle you have. This may not be a big deal in the longrun, as quickly after disaster and the disruption of services, fuel is going tobe hard to get. I also will stick to my initial advice that if you are notpreparing, start now. Make plans, and I recommend one of those plans being thatif you live in an urban area, plan to get out.Should disaster strike, there will be millions of people trapped bycircumstances, and they will not have the ability to evacuate to a remote area.This part of the population has a good chance of dying. I believe this wasconsidered in the study that predicted as much as 90 percent of the populationwill die if we lose the power grid. Sadly, there will be nothing that can bedone for these people. As panic sets in and they start starving, they willbecome roving bands of desperate looters looking for anything to help themsurvive. This large group of the population is justification for arming yourselfalong the lines suggested in this book. Up until disaster strikes, and I hope itdoesn’t, there will be arguments about the suggestions in this book. Afterdisaster strikes and the looting rampage begins, many will find out too latethat they should have armed themselves, and they will stand a good chance ofbecoming part of the predicted 90 percent.The intent here is not to get into a discussion on the Second Amendment orpeople’s personal like or dislike for weapons. If disaster strikes and you arenot ready to defend yourself and your family or group based on past wars anddisasters, I see no reasonable way you will be around long."},{"pageContent":"Chapter ThreeThe Rural Survival LocationRural survival locations make the occupants’ life easier than in urban areas.The rural location is safer, but in the event of disaster on a grand scale, itis still going to be a target for looters or raiders. I have friends who havebought land in Montana, Wyoming, and other rural states so they have a place togo. Some of that land is in remote areas that have no structures on theproperty; others have structures already. There are basically three plans inplace, and all have merit—all of these friends are former special operationstypes or police officers, so tactical and survival thinking was part of theirplan. The initial danger for this group as stated will be the move through areaswhere rioting or blocked routes will interfere with well-laid plans.Three Possible Plans• The property has no structures on it. Structures will be built once theproperty is occupied. All material and equipment for survival and defense willbe driven in by vehicles owned and procured for this purpose.• There is a structure on the property that will be occupied when disasterstrikes. All survival and defense material and equipment will be driven in bythe owners.• There are structures on the property that are stocked with basic gear andequipment. They are lived in by group members and maintained for the arrival ofthe rest of the group, who will drive in the large part of the survival anddefensive equipment. These maintenance personnel are usually retired groupmembers who are happy to be away from people and the stress of modern life.I am sure there are other workable plans out there that have been well thoughtout by people with no military experience. In the first scenario, the land withno structure is used for hunting and camping vacations by the owners, whichgives them the chance to learn the land and its potential. It also gives them achance to establish contact with the locals. These contacts, if initiated andhandled correctly, will pay dividends should disaster strike.In the second scenario, the owners are not leaving any survival or defensivegear to be taken by burglars who find the structure. They can do any fortifyingof the structure that they wish with no problems or distractions and can get toknow the land and its potential, along with making local contacts.The third scenario speaks for itself. Buildings can be fortified, gardens can beestablished, wells can be dug or water sources identified, and the property’spotential can be known and used immediately once the location is fully occupied.The group members who are securing the property can make friends and contacts inthe local populace. Over time, they will most likely be considered part of thelocal populace, which will make things easier as the situation deteriorates overtime.All of these plans depend on the owners and group members who are not on sitegetting there after disaster strikes. This, as stated, is the weakest part ofthe plan, as it depends on the extent of the damage done to the infrastructureand how fast looting gangs and raiders start blocking roads and inner arterials.Let’s take a look at some potential problems that may affect these moves to therural location. In the case of my friends who have these locations, moves of sixto eight hundred miles have to be made to get there. Some have fewer than twohundred to go—in their cases the trip can be made on a single tank of fuel—butthe move is still full of hazards after disaster strikes. This book is full ofinformation meant to make you think. If disaster strikes, each area of thecountry will have different situations in progress. The problem for groupsplanning to move to a rural location will be getting information about what isgoing on to make an informed decision.Potential Problems That May Impact the Move to Your Location• No available fuel along the route—the most likely situation• Looters or raiders blocking the route• An EMP (electromagnetic pulse) knocks out all vehicles• Major riots at the start location and along the route• Raiders or looters looking for trucks to hijack for their contents• Group members being unable to get to the start location• Breakdown of critical vehicles during the move—always a possibility to planforThese bullet points will give you an idea of potential problems. The list is byno means complete, many things can impact the move, but I think we have coveredenough of them to open up thought processes. Let’s talk about each oneindividually to generate discussion and assist preparation.No Available Fuel Along the RouteThis is a no-brainer; if you are going to have to refuel, you must have fuel.How far do you have to go? How many miles per gallon are you getting? That’s howmuch fuel you need in five-gallon cans with nozzles for each vehicle to make thetrip. Good sense and planning for possible route changes will have you put atleast two extra tanks of gas in cans for the trip. This alone is tonnagerequiring large trucks. To realistically prepare to make a group move in asurvival situation with all the food, water, and needed supplies will require alarge group with several transport vehicles. The bottom line is that you aregoing to have to move and secure tons of supplies, and the reality is that thismay ultimately prove impossible to most groups. There are survivalists who sayto have a seventy-two-hour bug-out bag ready to go. This is good advice, but ifthat’s all you have, you’re in trouble rather quickly after the three days.Looters or Raiders Blocking the RouteIn this instance, having communications is a necessity. If you have CB radiosand a solar-powered emergency radio in each vehicle, you may get priorinformation on road blockages. Planning and the use of GPSs and Google Earthbefore disaster strikes should give you some maps of alternate routes aroundlarge cities or possible off-road routes to your location. If you are seriousabout planning for disaster, travel to your remote survival location by yourplanned routes and make sure you have enough gas on hand. Planning and runningof planned routes is imperative to success. At the end of the day, based onsituations in progress, you may start your survival career in an unplannedlocation. I am sure this happened to many pioneers when our country was beingsettled. There are areas in our mountain states that any route taken aroundtowns or small cities will be an off-road route, so maps and some knowledge ofland navigation is imperative. Also, in rough terrain the recovery of boggeddown vehicles needs to be understood, and all vehicles should have winches.An EMP (Electromagnetic Pulse) Knocks Out All VehiclesGuess what, you’re screwed. If all vehicles are electrically knocked out and youcannot get them going, there are few options if your rural survival location issix or seven hundred miles away or farther. You will immediately be down to fewoptions—both good and bad. One good thing is that most, if not all, of yoursurvival and defensive gear is where you are, so that location could become yournew initial survival location by necessity. You could put as much as you caninto rucksacks and handcarts and start your move to your rural location—thatwould be a book by itself. Then it would be your call on leaving the rest behindor burning it along with the structure it is stored in. This will be a harddecision, but if the group is intact with all your survival gear, I suggestgetting to work fortifying your location to the best of your ability and takingthe steps to control your immediate surroundings. It may not be an idealsituation, but things will impact all plans and may cause an immediate anddrastic adjustment.Major Riots at the Start Location and Along the RouteWhen disaster breaks out in your city or area that you are familiar with, getthe vehicles packed—the big ones already should be—and get out of Dodge beforethe rioters get organized and start blocking roads with vehicles, burning tires,or whatever. Remember prior discussions in this book regarding this subject. Themove will be a tactical move, and hopefully the group is big enough to havearmed personnel in every vehicle. If not, drivers need to understand that theyare driving the best weapon they have. The group should also try to ensure thata critical national event has happened and the move is warranted. Do not stop,and get all vehicles rolling; if you are stopped, do what you have to do tosurvive. I can give no further advice here without knowing what situation youget into and frankly may have no advice except do what you have to do. If youare in trouble, I suspect you will have no communication. All I can do in thesecircumstances is write this book and wish you good luck. Plan, prepare, and planagain.Raiders or Looters Looking for Trucks to Hijack for Their ContentsThis will take place under three conditions:• An ambush of the trucks along a major route• A stopping checkpoint in a constricted area along the route• An open area stop and assault from their own vehiclesAll of these instances will put the truck or trucks on the defense. All trucksshould have armed group members in them to protect the driver and truck.Personal defense is going to be needed here whether from ambush, checkpoint, orattack. The reality is there may be group casualties, vehicles incapacitated,and a serious reorganization required even if you win the fight. Once spotted,any of the situations discussed are best handled by heavy, accurate firepowerand quick vehicle maneuvering. If you can get off-road and bypass any potentialtrouble, this would certainly be in your best interests. This requires planningand training—do it or fail. I cannot give good news here; the making of a goodand proper tactical move comes only from planning and training. Do not forget totake all looter or raider supplies with you if you win. Be prepared for asituation you have not planned for, as this happens frequently in combat andmost survival situations.Group Members Being Unable to Get to the Start LocationThis should be expected and planned for by all groups. Plans should be made, andthey will be impacted by certain critical events that may be happening. Theseplans should cover three basic contingencies.• A time to be present or be left behind should be established. This should belocked in stone, and all group members should know what to do in the event theycannot make the timed assembly of the group.• Along the route to the rural site, an assembly point should be picked wheremembers who could not make it to the start point can be picked up by the groupat a time known by all. As with the initial assembly time, this timeline shouldalso be unforgiving. More time spent waiting will ultimately impact your abilityto be successful in your move.• The group may make an agreed upon plan to go to the missing group members’locations along their planned route to see if they need assistance and contactcan be made with them. The whole group, with vehicles, would make this plannedmove. If disaster strikes the move, at least the group can react and hopefullynot be further fragmented.No matter what the plan, the group should decide on it together. This does notmean serious unplanned circumstances will not arise that will force an emergencychange to the plan and maybe throw the group into disarray. The more you planand the more you play devil’s advocate, the better you will be able to adjust tounplanned changes. In the situations we are discussing, there is not much thatwill go according to plan.Breakdown of Critical Vehicles During the Move• Should this happen, the situation will depend on what is going on around thebreakdown location. If the situation is normal and there is no threat, the drillwill be to see if the vehicle can be repaired or towed. If not, can the load beredistributed to the other vehicles? If there is only one vehicle making themove and it cannot be repaired, you have some decisions to make. One is if whereyou are can—or should—be your initial survival location. If the answer is no,some serious contingency planning and backpacking may be in order.• For multiple vehicles, the easiest and quickest solution would be to tow thedisabled vehicle to the survival location or a good defendable site until it canbe recovered. All vehicles should have tow straps. A good emergency tacticalplan would be to have tow straps already hooked up to both the front and back ofeach vehicle, especially the trucks. All trucks in my group have winches on thefront and tow straps on the back.• Should the breakdown happen in a populated area where violence is possible,a quick reload to other vehicles would probably be best, but this depends on howcritical the breakdown was. There are numerous situations where a breakdownwould be catastrophic to the group making the move. Any breakdown is a tacticalsituation, and the group will be faced with immediate and life-changingdecisions. When making any move, make sure you have adequate means to defend themove and, if necessary, extract the group and as much survival equipment as canbe carried. If a vehicle is reloaded on another vehicle, make sure the fuel isdrained from the tank and put into the other vehicles. If there is room on theother vehicles, you may want to take the wheels and any other parts that wouldcome in handy.Having read these tips, a good exercise would be to figure out what equipmentyou would need to accomplish those tasks. Plan, plan, and plan. No matter whatyou know you need, unless you have an extremely large group and functioningvehicles, you are never going to be able to carry or procure it all. You willquickly amass unmanageable tonnage. If in a rural or urban survival location,determine what you are going to have to do and what tools or equipment you needto do it. There are no good answers in these scenarios. Every group orindividual must determine what is critical versus what’s nice to have.Ask Yourself What You Will Need to Have or Do• Will I need books and reference data?• Will I need to make location repairs?• Will I need to fortify my location?• Will I have to defend myself and others?• Will I have to see at night?• Will I need to make fires?• Will I need to gather firewood?• Will I need to sharpen axes and knives?• Will I have to hunt game?• Will I have to maintain and repair weapons?• Will I have to process game?• Will I have to cook?• Will I have to can food?• Am I going to fish for food?• Will I grow a garden?• Will I have to carry water?• Will I have to trap rainwater?• Will I have to purify water?• Will group members get hurt?• How will I care for them?• Will I have to carry injured group members any distance?• Will the group get infections or minor injuries?• Will I need to control rodents?• Will babies be born?• Will I need warm clothes and bedding?• Will I need extra footwear?• Will I need to make or repair clothes?• What can I hunt with to save ammunition?• Will I have to build any survival structures, and will I have to make themwaterproof?• Will I need to tell direction?• Will I have to carry heavy loads?• Will I need rope and tie-downs?• Will I need to clean myself and the living area?• Will I need tools?• Will I have to deal with human waste and garbage?• Will I have to bury anyone who dies?• Will I have to dig a hole?• Where do we go if forced out of the survival location?• What will I need to survive if forced out of the survival location?• Where do I cache it?• Will I have to survive extreme hot or cold weather?• How much salt do I need per day?Take this list and ask yourself what you will need to accomplish each task. Addto that food, water, fuel, guns, ammunition, and nice things to have that wehave already discussed. Add this to what you already have on hand, and you areworking on tonnage. The tools and items to ensure survival will take planningand preparation, and they will strain everyone’s experience. I am not a prepperor hard-core survivalist, but I am experienced enough to plan for disaster.There are large military and civilian trucks for sale, and if you can purchaseone, these would be an advantage for any planned trip to a rural survival site.If you have to go off-road, the higher the vehicle is off the ground withfour-wheel drive, the better in my experience. To start realizing what it willtake to operate in a remote rural area, get the group together and brainstormyour lists against what you have and what you need to get. Let’s look at thefirst question on the list.image [../Images/62-1.jpg]One question that many people ask is if they can survive extreme hot or coldweather. (Dale C. Spartas/http://www.spartasphoto.com[http://www.spartasphoto.com])Question: Will I need books and reference data?Answer: More than you can even imagine.We are in the age of instant education; you can get any information at the touchof a finger. Once the power goes out and we find ourselves a couple hundredyears back in history capability-wise, that is over. So let’s put the thinkingcaps on as a group and start deciding what reference books would be good tohave. I will put a list below for reference, and you will need to add the restdepending on your plans.Good References to Have• First aid and sanitation• How to garden• Land navigation• Processing game• Campfire cooking• Weapons repair• Caching• Carpentry• Canning• Other ways to preserve food without refrigeration• How to fish• Survival books• How to shoot• Tactical manuals• Maps• Vehicle repairAbove is a good start, but the rest is up to you. A good reference library in arural or urban area would be more than worth the effort it takes to put ittogether and transport it. Some references can be printed off the Internet andput into a three-ring binder, but books will last longer.I said before, whether you are in a rural or urban location, everythingnonperishable should be in packs or boxes and ready for quick loading intoavailable transportation. If vehicles are not available, this transportation maybe handcarts and similar equipment. If you have to head out with handcarts andyour remote site is six hundred miles away, you probably won’t make it for acouple of months or longer—if you make it at all. There might be an acceptablelocation closer, but you may have to start from scratch. However, the people whosettled this country were often in the same situation.Let’s say you have done your homework on the above list, and you are ready tomove if necessary. This will always be ongoing on the preparation side. Animportant part of that preparation is the visits to your rural survival site.One thing is certain: if there is vehicle access to the site and a structure onit, eventually it will be found and possibly broken into unless it is occupiedfull time. Nothing but everyday living materials should be there. Nothing shouldbe there full time that you cannot afford to lose. Even in remote areas, thereare opportunists or just bad apples.Visits to the location should be spent becoming imminently familiar with theland and surrounding terrain. Any vegetation clearing for observation anddefense purposes should be done and maintained. Potential cache sites should bepicked and game availability assessed. Water sources should be evaluated andwood-gathering areas decided on. If you have had the rural site for any lengthof time, moving to it should be looked on as moving to a better place, but asdiscussed previously, if things go bad you must first survive the trip. I ammost comfortable having a remote site I can get to with a single tank of fuel.Where I live, this is possible, but it is not for many of my friends who have along way to go through many unknown circumstances.When loading vehicles for the trip to the survival location, they should all bereverse loaded. This means long-term survival gear is loaded first and thingsneeded upon arrival loaded last. Critical items, such as weapons, ammunition,tools, food, and water, should be cross-loaded onto different vehicles in caseone or more vehicles are lost for whatever reason. This technique prevents thegroup from losing everything they need should disaster strike the move.Groups who are moving to a survival property where no structures are on the siteshould pack their vehicles the same way. The difference is in considering whatthey will need first in these circumstances. Are they going to initially buildtents and then structures or survival shelters? The trucks should be loadedappropriately. All equipment not immediately needed should stay in the vehiclesuntil needed.Circumstances may force a quick move even in a remote area, and if supplies areunloaded and strewn about, the chance of losing a lot of what you need is great.Never come back from a trip before disaster strikes without immediately fillingall fuel tanks.Let’s say the move to the rural site went well and you are approaching the area.Only own it for occupation once you prove no one is waiting to ambush yourarrival. We have discussed three options for your survival location.No Structure on the LocationStop the vehicles at a predetermined point that is defendable and as close aspossible for an easy foot move. Half the group sets up security around thevehicles, and half the group makes a tactical move into the initial site pickedfor occupation and makes a sweep to ensure it is clear of ambushers. The site iskept under observation while the trucks are contacted by whatever means areavailable and brought forward. In a perfect world you would have radiocommunication, but if not, couriers have to make the move on foot. Planning willmake this time-consuming operation more efficient.The vehicles are then put into a defensive perimeter, and the initial site isprepared. I suggest waiting and observing the surrounding areas or woods untilyou are satisfied that you are alone, then post guards who continue to observewhile the initial site is set up. All tents or shelters should be inside thevehicle perimeter. Vehicles become initial cover if looters or raiders fire onyou. The group should plan to arrive at the rural site early in the morning soyou have a full day to set up and establish 24/7 security. Stopping in a close,defendable location if it’s getting late is a good plan. Secure yourself thatnight, then make an early morning tactical move into the site to give yourself afull day to set up your initial site.Structure Unoccupied on PropertyThis property should be occupied the same way as a property with no structure onit. The only difference is that the structure should be tactically cleared toensure it is empty. All other protocols are in place—with the exception that youhave a structure to occupy and vehicles should be pulled up to the house so theycan be covered by guards. Twenty-four-seven security operations for the groupstart on arrival at the site. A good technique for seeing if anyone has been onyour property is to install trail cameras to monitor the area during one of yourvisits.Structure on Site Occupied by Group MembersThis should be the easiest if plans are in place and everyone knows the plan.Upon arrival, a few group members dismount and make contact with the on-sitemembers by an arranged signal. Then bring up the vehicles and begin occupyingthe site. A second option is that vehicles drive up to an arranged site,recognition signals are verified, vehicles move onto the site, and security andmove-in operations are started. There should be a duress signal that is known byall that the occupying group members and arriving members know. This is in theevent that the site is taken over by looters or raiders and they are waiting inambush. Being in the business I have been in, I would stop the vehicles close tothe site in a good defensible position and send three or four group membersforward to observe the site undetected for a few hours to ensure all is well. Ihave occasionally been called paranoid for thinking this way, but it has savedmy life in critical situations on two occasions. You will have to make thedecision to do what you think is best after reading this book. In the event of adisaster, I hope this book gives you good options you may not have previouslythought of. In the end, you will live or die by the decisions you make. I livein a rural state and have left my house vacant for a year at a time and havenever had any problems. With this in mind, will I be able to do that afterdisaster strikes? I think not.In my life, I have been in some of the most remote areas in this country and theworld. I have been in most mountainous areas in Montana, Wyoming, NorthCarolina, and Washington State; I have been in Louisiana swamps, Georgiamountains, and Tennessee hills. On numerous occasions I have thought I wastwenty to fifty miles away from any human, but that thought was generally provenwrong by a myriad of hunters, backpackers, hikers, campers, geologists, forestrangers, etc. Your rural survival spot, no matter how remote, is known by a lotmore people than you think.It is a given that if disaster strikes, you are going to have to defend yourselffrom people trying to get what you have. You will have to do this more in urbanareas due to the amount of people in your location. In rural areas, you mustkeep the same security protocols as in the city, but the chance of dealing withpeople who may not be a threat is better. That does not mean you can take asecurity break—stay ready and on guard. The difference in rural areas is thatthere are numerous people who can take care of themselves and know how tosurvive on their own in a survival situation. You will have people approach youthat may want to join the group. You may have people ask the group for help.This could happen in urban areas, as well. In the group’s planning andpreparation, the group rules for interacting with other people during survivalor disaster situations should fall along these lines no matter where you are—inyour survival location or out gathering. Failure to follow these rules willsooner or later result in disaster for the group.The Rules• Every contact with others is a tactical situation.• People are not trusted until they prove themselves.• Anyone taken in by the group must be an asset and lend something to thegroup.• No sick, injured, or mentally disturbed people.• No deadweight—if they do not conform to group rules, deal with them quickly.• Only take in numbers you can watch, guard, or vet that they are what theysay.• Do not let them have weapons until they prove themselves.• Be careful in all situations; control your immediate and surrounding space.The chance of making bad decisions is good, so watch out for slick talkers whotry to get a portion of the group into a specific area. If it sounds too good tobe true, it most likely isn’t a good choice.• While in your rural hide, there will be danger areas. The first is thelocation where you are set up, so guard it 24/7 or pay the price. The otherdanger areas should be moved into and worked in tactically.Other Danger Areas• Latrines• Wood-gathering areas• Water-gathering areas, including bathing areas• Dump, burial, or burn sites• Game-processing areas• Hunting areas, such as tree stands or blinds• Any movement outside the main locationThe bottom line is that a group member should always be watching the back ofworkers. The duties should be rotated regularly. I cannot tell you how many VietCong, Taliban, Al Qaeda, and other bad guys around the world have died quicklyby not securing themselves in critical situations because they thought they weresafe. If disaster strikes on a grand scale, the rest of your life may be spentin a critical situation. It’s your call on what your life is worth and what youare willing to do to preserve it. The percentage of us who are prepared willlive or die like everyone else by following or ignoring the rules. It’s easy todrop your guard when you think you’re safe or when security becomes routine.That is exactly what raiders and looters are looking for when they are on theprowl. Always keep in mind that you and your group are not the only ones armedand planning.I have put out advance copies of this book for friends to review, and some saidcivilians reading this might not know some of the tactics I have posted. Iagree, and that is why prior preparation and training are critical. No one knowswhen disaster of epic circumstances will happen, so now is the time to startpreparing. This book cannot possibly address all the preparation and trainingneeds of millions of individuals. It will, however, give you a start. Within thecountry, there are millions of veterans who served in combat arms during theirservice. Most people know at least one of these veterans, and that’s a goodstart. At the rear of this book, I will also include a list of training andshooting schools that will assist your efforts. To put everything that could bedone to prepare for unknown disasters into this book would produce a document soheavy it could not be lifted. The lists I have provided so far will give anygroup a good start. Go over the lists as a group item by item, and list what youhave versus what you need for equipment and training. Start now, the clock isticking.One of the most important things a group in a remote location should be payingattention to is signs that other people are present. One thing that is helpfulis for group members to have the same soles on boots and running shoes sooutside tracks can be detected. Noises, such as talking, gunshots, andwoodcutting, should be listened for. Group members should also pick differentpieces of terrain where large tracts of the property and surrounding land can beobserved with binoculars and hopefully provide early warning of outsiderapproach.Some dogs will benefit security and generally give early warning, but they willhave to be fed. A good plan if this is a long-term survival situation is to havemales and females that can breed. If the food situation gets bad, you can alwaysreduce your early warning capability by enhancing your food supply.I have seen several properties that friends are planning to use as survivallocations. With one exception, all were well thought out and had an abundance oftrees for firewood and water on the location. Firewood and water are imperativefor survival, especially in states with harsh winters. Land with hills willprovide shelter from high winds and long-range observation of the location butwill allow close approach to the site by anyone entering the property. No matterhow bad you would like to stay on the site without being found, your occupationof the site will ensure your detection by anyone in the immediate, and possiblyadjoining, areas.image [../Images/69-1.jpg]Water is imperative for survival. (Dale C. Spartas/http://www.spartasphoto.com[http://www.spartasphoto.com])Look around at surrounding terrain. If you can see far hills, you can be seen byanyone on them. Smoke from cooking or warming fires can be seen and smelled atlong ranges. No matter how big or small the group may be, the very act of movingto collect water, firewood, and game will leave well-worn trails that will leadto the site. Gardens will be a giveaway of close habitation, as will garbagedumps or burn sites. The bottom line is that you will be found—probably soonerthan later. Let’s keep it simple with security: there is either a problemimminent, a potential problem, or things are normal. Groups can use whateversecurity protocols they wish. The following status of security is just a guide.Group Security StatusNormal• Everyone sleeps—two or three guards are always watching.• Work parties are out—a guard is watching.• Everyone is eating—two or three guards are watching.• Visitors show up—two or three guards are watching.Potential Problem• Two-thirds of the group sleep or work and are armed—one-third guards.• This can be modified depending on group capability and knowledge of thesituation.Problem Imminent• Half sleep or work and are armed—half guards.This is as simple as it gets. When attacked or if a direct, active threatpresents itself, all hands are on deck at determined defensive positions. Groupswill use whatever security protocols they believe they need. These will be basedon site location, group size, threat to the group, terrain surrounding thelocation, and the group’s ability to deal with the situation effectively. Ifthere are hills close to your rural survival location, it is probable that youwill be observed by anyone interested in the location, and any attack on yourlocation will either come from those hills, be supported from those hills, orboth. You will be operating at all times in a potential problem status oncedisaster happens. The amount of people who may be moving into remote areas couldbe excessive the closer the area is to large population centers.I have a large high hill that starts in my backyard and goes up on a 30 percentuniform slope for one hundred and fourteen yards to the crest. The side of thehill has a few bushes; the top of the hill has seventy yards along the crest ofthick mountain mahogany bushes. There are no bushes on the hill that are notperiodically and selectively trimmed. Anyone in those bushes is backlit by thecuttings so while in the bushes, you would never know you had an issue unlessyou were very well trained. People who I have sent there to observe or lookthrough their scopes come under one heading: easily identifiable targets. Youmay not want to go to this extreme, but you should be able to control yoursurrounding areas out to three hundred yards at least.When planning and visiting your rural survival area, this discussion is one ofthe preparation points that should be accomplished. All the tactical planningshould have the objective of making it hard for looters or raiders to besuccessful against you. Any preparation of terrain should focus on what you cando to make easy targets out of the people attacking you. We have been talkingabout group security and protecting the survival location. We are discussingrural locations in this chapter, but it should not be lost on anyone that truesecurity and safety is attained by a large well-prepared group. I will juststate facts here; groups will have to accomplish all we have discussed in thisbook. The smaller the group, the less chance you will have of being successful.Things That Will Cause Group Failure• Lack of planning, preparation, and training• Not adhering religiously to tactical and security protocols• Attrition of the group through casualties• Group sickness due to neglecting good sanitation requirements• Dissent, infighting, or traitors in the group• Failure to successfully hunt and gather food and water• Failure to prepare and stock up for a harsh winter• Making bad tactical and security decisionsThere are certainly other things that can be added to the list, but if thesefactors are in order, the chance of the group surviving will be above average inany catastrophic national disaster that causes a long-term survival situation.In a remote rural area, part of security is looking for signs daily that tellyou that you are not alone.Signs to Look or Listen For• Footprints crossing your normal routes of movement• If vehicles are working, any unknown vehicle tracks• Horse tracks• Campfires the group didn’t make• Shelters the group didn’t make• Digging or woodcutting the group didn’t do• Gunshots• Signs of dressing animals the group didn’t kill• Hunting arrows the group didn’t shoot• Missing items from storage areas or gardens• Human voices• Sounds of woodcutting• Barking dogs not owned by the group• Strangers moving around the propertyIf you are paying attention to the above list, you should not be surprised byvisitors or attackers. If any of the above signs are close to the survivalstructures, you need to accept that you have been found. The first questionshould be why they did not make contact. Raise the group’s security levelconsiderably, and start some patrols around to see what may be going on andcoming at you.This would be a group call based on what has been found or detected and whatthey know should be going on around them. There is no good news here. Know whatis going on around you, stay alert and on guard, or pay the price. This too is agroup call. I have talked about injured and deadweight group members. Familygroups with these members will have to make their own decisions. Those decisionswill be difficult and life-changing, but you must look at it from a life ordeath survival situation. Do you keep a family member who may cause the group tofail, or do you get rid of him or her by throwing them out of the group? This isa hard call, and no one can make it but the affected group. Of course, injuredgroup members in good standing can do light guard duty at the survival location.Removing unwanted family members from the group would by no means set aprecedent.Part of your group preparation should be considering who should be in the group.Both family groups and nonfamily groups that were formed due to the situationwill have problems dealing with people who may be a hindrance to the group. Ifin normal time before the disaster strikes there is dislike for a person, thisis not going to get better once disaster strikes and things get critical andlife-threatening. I will leave this subject by saying groups will fare muchbetter if they are a close, functional group with no deadweight members.In a rural area while in a survival situation, people in the group are going toget hurt. Before the disaster, it’s a simple act to transport them to theemergency room or call an ambulance on your cell phone. This is not going tohappen if disaster strikes. While in a remote area, we are basically on our ownand stuck with having to deal with medical emergencies with what we have athand. If the group has trained EMTs or doctors with equipment, that is great. Ifthey do not, some serious training and equipping during preparation is required.Realistically, if you have serious medical emergencies, you are probably goingto watch group members die as a result of those emergencies. There is no goodnews here. In a later chapter, we will talk about equipment and cover themedical equipment that is available and will do a good job taking care of minorinjuries, but very few of them take care of serious injuries, such as gunshotwounds. Yes, you can bandage the wound and maybe stop the bleeding, but gunshotwounds require surgery. Unless you have a trained surgeon, you are dead in thewater for saving the group member who is critically injured.In all groups, there will be members who are looking for perfect answers. Afterthe disaster there will be none, and if you realistically look at what has takenplace before the disaster you will quickly realize there are no guarantees.Family members or group members only have to take a look at what has happened intheir lives when times were good: how many vehicle accidents with injuries havehappened and how many trips there were to the emergency room for bad cuts,broken bones, or the flu. All these will continue to happen after the disaster.The reality will be that you will most likely have to deal with them at thegroup level, especially in a remote environment.If you go back two hundred years, people living in remote areas were left mainlyto their own devices. In modern society, we have gotten used to running toWal-Mart or the emergency room when things are needed or go bad. This should bewell understood by all planning a move to a remote location. You will be on yourown. A knee-jerk response will be to stock up on medical equipment. This is agood idea, but it is effort wasted if trained personnel to use the equipment arenot available. It is easy to say, but attention to detail goes a long way inpreventing sickness, such as having warm clothes in the winter and staying dryand out of the wind. Groups need to realize that in a remote area, sooner orlater you are going to run out of everything, and you will truly be forced tolive off the land."},{"pageContent":"Chapter FourThe Individual SurvivorI would like to think that this book, as well as other survival books andwebsites, will convince a large part of the population to start to prepare. Ifthis does take place, there will still be hundreds of thousands, if notmillions, who will start out any disaster alone. I know several individuals whoare preparing to do just that. I have stated previously that individuals willhave a hard time surviving—more so in an urban environment than a rural one. Cana lone individual survive on his or her own in a survival situation that maylast years? The answer is certainly yes, and there is data to support this. Geton the Internet and reference Eric Rudolph of North Carolina. This individualwas wanted by law enforcement for an abortion clinic bombing. He was on the runin remote areas for five years before being arrested by a deputy while lookingfor food in a dumpster. He did it in a remote area that he had intimateknowledge of and had prepared, but he was finally pushed into a patrolled areaand was caught. A lot of the time, he evaded well-trained law enforcementofficers with dogs. Eventually he just ran out of food. There are reports thathe occasionally had help from friends and was given shelter and food, but thisnotwithstanding, he proved it could be done in a remote area under severerestrictions.In 2014, we had Eric Matthew Frein, who was accused of ambushing twoPennsylvania state troopers—allegedly killing one and wounding the other. Freinwent into a remote area that he had spent years preparing. He evaded hundreds oflaw enforcement officers who looked for him. Their search turned up preparedbooby traps and caches of food, equipment, weapons, and ammunition. Obviously heprepared well. Nevertheless, as predicted during the writing of this book, USMarshals apprehended Eric Frein on October 30, 2014.Even If Trained, Experienced, and Prepared, These Things Work Against anIndividual• He will eventually have to move outside the hide.• He will leave tracks or signs.• He will most likely be seen in an urban area.• His supplies will have to be replaced fairly quickly.• Eventually he will have to hunt and cook what he acquires.• He will have to pass human waste and hide it.• He may get sick or hurt.• In harsh winters, he will have to build a fire.• He will have to carry everything he needs on his back or a cart.• If anyone is hunting him, they will eventually find him or he will walk intothem while moving.This list just about guarantees an individual will run into people. It will bequicker in an urban area because of the mass of people that will be movingaround. In a rural setting, the bigger the area the individual has to move in,the longer he may last, but eventually his luck will run out.If you are going to prepare an area for individual survival, you need to make alist of what you may have to do and the equipment you will need to do it. If youlook at it realistically, the list will not differ much from the one in ChapterThree [../Text/008_Chapter003.html]. There are some glaring differences, as theindividual survivor will not be able to depend on guards and group support. Putthat up against the fact that he will have to sleep, and you can see that therewill be a constant pressure of finding a place to sleep that is secure. Just thecapability of finding a secure place and determining that you are not beingfollowed by someone who has seen you is a time-consuming and never-ending task.Additionally, that place will have to change regularly lest you leave worntrails, which will lead others to you. Many things must be determined by theindividual survivor if there is to be any chance of him lasting any amount oftime.He Must First Pick His Area and Determine• Are there hide places where I will be secure?• How many cache sites will I need?• Are they available on the terrain I have picked?• Can I survive a harsh winter?• If I have to hunt game, can I do it silently?• Are there water sources available?• Are there places I can build a fire with multiple escape routes if detected?• What if my cache sites are found?• Can I find a site for a long-term stay if it snows?• Can I stock it for the stay?• What will I need to carry if found and forced out of the area?The individual is in a lot of trouble if other people are around the area andlooking for food, water, or any survival equipment they can find regardless ofif they are in a rural or urban setting. Now let’s modify the planning list inChapter Three [../Text/008_Chapter003.html] for the individual. Remember theconstants: he will have to eat, sleep, and drink water, and he will need fireand shelter.A Planning List for an Individual’s Cache• Will I need books and reference data?• Will I have to build survival shelters in adverse weather?• Will I have to see at night?• Will I have to make fires?• Will I have to dig a hole?• Will I or can I grow a garden?• Will I have to gather firewood?• Will I have to cook?• Will I have to sharpen axes and knives?• Will I have to hunt game?• Will I have to maintain and repair weapons?• Will I have to process game?• Will I have to fish?• Will I have to carry water?• Will I have to trap rainwater?• Will I have to purify water?• What do I need if I am hurt or sick?• Will I get infections or minor injuries?• Will I need warm clothes and bedding?• Will I need extra footwear?• Will I need to make or repair clothes?• What do I need to hunt silently?• Will I need to tell direction?• Will I need to carry heavy loads?• Will I need rope and tie-downs?• Will I need to clean myself and my clothes?• How do I get rid of waste and garbage?• Where do I go if forced out of my chosen location?• What will I need to survive if forced out of location?• Where do I cache it?• What do I need on my person and in caches to protect myself?• How much salt will I need per day, and where do I get it?You can see why Eric Frein took years to prepare his remote area. Obviously, hewas not totally successful in caching because the law enforcement officerssearching for him found some of them, or he was careless in picking his hidesites. Anyone contemplating individual survival in any rural or remote area istaking on a job he cannot be successful in for the long term—at least to wherehe is comfortable. If you look at the planning list and figure what equipment itentails, along with the equipment weight—not to mention keeping track of andfinding the right cache sites—you certainly would need years to accomplish thistask. You would also need to take the time to know the area intimately.One thing that will get you ambushed is that you will have to visit your cachesites regularly, and this will eventually wear an observable trail right to thesite. In urban areas, you may not make as many trails, but you will make fewmovements without someone observing you, especially in the early days of thedisaster. As time goes by and more and more hungry people are moving around—mostlikely in groups—the chance of running into them, possibly at close range, isalmost ensured. Also, as an individual you may be incapable of the logisticefforts required to cache and the tactical requirements to ensure theirprotection.Whatever terrain you pick to sleep in a rural area must be somewhere peoplewould not generally go—and never at night. The terrain you pick for survivalshould be heavily wooded, mountainous, and remote. Places picked for sleepingshould be in the thickest vegetation you can find. If a survival shelter must bebuilt due to inclement weather, it will be hidden, and anyone moving in the areaafter dark will certainly make noise. In urban terrain, your sleeping areashould be where you will not be found. Intimate knowledge of what is happeningaround you and buildings or available areas will be mandatory and still may notkeep you secure. If anyone in what would be hundreds of buildings saw you, I canguarantee you will have visitors you do not want. In rural terrain, thesurrounding hills are your enemy, as anyone on them with binoculars will see youand move on you.In an urban setting, I cannot see a lone individual surviving for any length oftime without running into people who would want to do him harm. With that beingsaid, if the individual knows his area of movement and has watched the movementof other people in the vicinity, he may last a long time before luck runs out.For example, I have spent years moving about urban areas where detection was notin my best interest. I can say without reservation that from about three in themorning until around five or six, you can get away with almost anything. Inareas where combat is taking place, there are always guards on duty that you mayrun into. In a survival situation, a lot of people, for a myriad of reasons fromhunger to sickness to worry, would not be sleeping regularly and would bewatching the streets. Many may not care that they see someone moving, and youwould have no issues. However, others, especially a group, would wonder what youmight be carrying and if they could use it. In rural terrain, many people whocannot sleep may use the darkness to move around while feeling secure in theirmovements.Planning your route in an urban area at any time, even if meticulously plannedand executed, may not be enough if large amounts of people are observing fromthe many buildings. The chance of running into a group or individual you do notwant to meet is almost assured. Planning your route in a rural area if you knowpeople are near is just as important. Moving undetected requires planning,skill, and knowledge of the terrain.image [../Images/80-1.jpg]In a rural setting, observe with binoculars before moving to your next point onthe ground. (Dale C. Spartas/http://www.spartasphoto.com[http://www.spartasphoto.com])In a rural setting, properly planned movement will work most of the time if youare using the terrain properly, moving slowly, and observing with binocularsbefore moving to your next point on the ground. Staying off present trails,staying in shadows, and using the vegetation to your advantage works most of thetime—even with many people looking for you. Most people who decide to go theindividual route of survival do not have other people they know to form a group,do not trust people, or are afraid of people. No matter what the reason is thatthey decided to go it alone, they have chosen a path that is problematic everyday for the duration of the situation. Just determining what they are going tocarry with them day to day may decide their fate.If it’s summer, winter clothes and bedding will not be needed, and just food,water, and protective gear can be carried. If it’s winter, the load on theindividual goes up. There are good and bad things about preparing your survivalarea with caches. With caches of support equipment and sustenance, things can beeasier as long as what you have stored lasts, but these caches also tie you tothe area. They become your personal store for everything. If, for whateverreason, the caches are found or you are run out of the area, you will goimmediately to surviving with what you are carrying and what game you canacquire. One good thing is that with a disaster, a certain percentage of thepopulation will move or evacuate quickly, and in an urban area this will assurenumerous structures for temporary shelter. In rural areas, any structure willhave to be fabricated from existing materials. These needed survival structureswill also key other people into your presence.In this chapter on individual survival actions, I will bounce back and forthfrom urban to rural areas as I think of situations. You will notice, as with therest of the book, this chapter seems to have no structure; however, it is fullof critical information for survival.If an individual is out and moving, he should be carrying a pack that willsustain him for at least seventy-two hours or more. Small military units go outinto remote, dangerous areas with packs that sustain them for a week or more.The reason an individual should have this equipment with him is in the eventthat he has to evade a group and cannot get back to his hide. In addition toprotective gear, the pack should contain food, water, shelter, and fire-makingmaterials. I have learned from my military survival training, as well as books Ihave read, that it is pretty much a given that these are the four essentials tosupport life. This holds true in the urban or rural setting. For example, in anurban area if it’s below zero outside, eventually in buildings with no servicesit will become below zero inside, as well.image [../Images/82-1.jpg]A map and compass are two of several items you should never travel withoutduring a disaster. (Dale C. Spartas/http://www.spartasphoto.com[http://www.spartasphoto.com])Regardless of what is in your pack, never travel without your guns, ammunition,compass, and binoculars. If the individual does not find food and water once heruns out of what he is carrying or has cached, he is on borrowed time. He willrapidly weaken, become ineffective, and start making mistakes that will mostlikely get him killed before he starves to death or dies of dehydration. Ifdisaster strikes, there will be numerous individuals who will try to go italone. This will probably only end in disaster, but the world is full of storiesof people who have been lost in the wild for weeks and survived by eating bugsand worms and drinking out of mud puddles. This is not a good life, but it islife and with that there is always luck and hope.With a lot of luck and experience, an individual with a little equipment andknowledge could last a long time. One of the things Rudolph and Frein did wasfind people’s gardens or stored food and took it while they were gone or asleep.In a long-term survival situation, I am sure if that chance presented itself tothe individual, he would take advantage of it. I am also sure whoever he took itfrom would not be happy and would go looking for him. I suggest you stock up asmuch as you can and then put distance between you and whomever you looted. Inthe end, what the individual loots from others is good survival practice, butchasing him down and killing him is a natural survival reaction.An individual who wants to be alone and stay away from other people willprobably fail and be found if he is in an area where winters are cold and long.He will not want to get wet, he will want to stay out of the wind, and he willneed a fire daily. That fire will provide lifesaving warmth, but it will alsosend a possibly life-ending signal to looters or raiders.Problems with Fires• Anyone downwind will smell it.• If it’s smoky, anyone close or in the line of sight will see it.• At night, the glare will be seen by anyone in the line of sight.• At night, vision outside the cone of light is made more difficult.• Unless the fire residue can be hidden, people will have a starting point totrack you.These points are true and have gotten combat soldiers and civilians in combatareas killed all over the world. Nevertheless, in a winter environment, a firewill be essential to survival. If the individual has the right bedding tosurvive the night, he could build fires only in the daytime. He may be able tobuild a mainly smoke-free fire if he has the right wood. He may find a good drystreambed or gully to build a small warming fire in and not be detected. In anycase, the need for a daily fire requires the gathering of wood, which raises thechance of being found considerably. A lifesaving fire in winter while people arelooking to do you harm is a double-edged sword; it can get you killed whilesaving your life.Another problem for the individual in winter is that once it snows, anyone canfind his tracks. Deep snow may restrict his movement, make wood gatheringdifficult, and escape, if found, virtually impossible. If he should be injuredor become sick to the point where he cannot take care of himself, he will surelydie. Here, as in a lot of life or death situations, there is no good news.Another weakness for the individual—and they are numerous—is that he must cacheammunition for his weapons and hope they are not found. If he is carryingseventy-two hours of sustaining equipment, he is going to be limited on theammunition he can carry. He can offset this problem by either caching or goingthe .22 rifle route. If he is carrying a .22, he can carry hundreds of roundswith him. I suggest the individual survivor also have a bow and arrow for silenthunting. There are excellent fold-up bows that would fit any survival situation.Crossbows are also a good close-range silent weapon. The problem with crossbowsand compound bows is if they break, they require tools and repair parts. Thesecan, of course, be cached, but I personally prefer a simple recurve bow withextra strings carried in my pack. The choice of anything, including bow andweapons, must be an individual’s choice. I may recommend something that mightnot be the best choice all around, but it is the best choice for me.No matter what the individual decides he needs, he is not going to be able tocarry it all. Good locations for cache sites will need to be picked or created,and multiple trips to your cache site will eventually leave a trail right to it.The best way to cache is to store several things in it you will need to survive,and when the time comes where you need it, visit the cache site one time andclean it out. If someone finds the location dug up and empty, all they have is adug up and empty cache site.Let’s talk about a true survival situation as it pertains to the individual. Iwant people reading this book to understand what I am saying about individualsurvival and the range of possible disasters and successes the individual faces.If you have read this chapter up to this point, you have already got a lot ofinformation on what faces an individual in a survival situation. If he is in aremote area and there is no one else for miles, his survival depends on hisskills and his ability to gather food and water, to get a fire going, and tobuild a survival shelter to protect himself from the weather. It also depends onwhat gear he has with him and how proficient he is with it. In an urbansituation, it will eventually boil down to how clever, well prepared, and luckyhe is.The next situation I can see is that the individual is in a long-term survivalsituation in either an urban or rural setting and there are other people inclose proximity. In this situation, the individual who wants or has to stay awayfrom others is dependent on how well prepared he is and how adept he is atstaying away from the others. Several things will be in play that will affectthe end game one way or the other. The first is that everyone in the area,whether a group or individuals, will be in a live-or-die survival situation.They will also be in competition with each other for any available food, water,fire, or shelter needs. In this scenario, everyone is trying to survive, and noone has the time to spend looking for the other survivors. This is where luckcomes in and an individual may not be found or walk into the others. Therefore,he continues to do what he has to do to survive. This situation is one where Ibelieve a move will be forced on everyone who is physically able as the area’sfood sources are depleted.A third situation would be where the previous situation is taking place butthere are groups that are big enough that while part of the group is gatheringwhat the group needs to survive, the other part of the group is dedicated toroving the area to find other survivors and loot what they have. This would bethe most dangerous for the individual survivor and would quickly force him tomove his location or join up with a group for protection. If this part of thebook does nothing else, I hope it sheds a little light on the folly of trying tomake it alone. Planning is mandatory for the individual, but very quickly thecards are going to be stacked against him in situations where other people orgroups are around.One thing the individual has going for him is that most untrained groups do notknow how to search a piece of land, either urban or rural, and are operatingunder a false sense of superiority. If an individual is observing the spacearound him before moving and is using well-prepared hide sites, he has a goodchance of staying away from those pursuing him. Go back and reread the dangersof making fires and traveling in snow, as these are the big dangers that willlead people to you, along with gunshots if you cannot hunt silently.One of the misconceptions that a lot of folks have is that the remote areas arefull of game for hunting. This is true in some areas, but in others there isalmost nothing to catch. You only need to look at some of the reality survivalshows on TV to see how hard or impossible it is to catch anything to eat on aregular basis. If a national disaster strikes, forcing everyone to survive onwhat they can find in both urban and rural areas, what food or game exists willrapidly be depleted. Here, as in other situations described in this book, thereis no good news.Let’s talk about hide sites. There are several theories on what makes a hidesite. One, it should be in a place that is extremely hard to find or get to. Inrural areas, use the thickest vegetation you can find. You can also dig it in orfind a hill with a cut in it. I have gotten under a low growing spruce tree inan area that was not heavily vegetated and watched several people look for meand not find me. I was in a good camouflaged ghillie suit and blended well withthe tree I was under. The bottom line is that hide sites work, but they musteither not be found or blend in with their surroundings. In some vegetation, youcan get under it without leaving a trace of your presence. This comes under theheading of find a hole and pull it over you. This is using camouflage, the artof blending in, to its maximum. Do not forget, camouflage is a stationary art,so movement is easily detected. Some people think that putting on a camouflagesuit and painting your face means you can move around without being detected.In my time, I have trained many hundreds of military and police snipers andrecon personnel, and all have heard this statement from me: “The bestcamouflaged man in the world who is moving looks just like the best camouflagedman in the world moving.” Movement is instantly detected by anyone watching inboth urban and rural environments. Some terrain looks like nothing could hide init. Areas that come to mind are the Yakima desert area in eastern WashingtonState, the high desert areas of eastern Montana and Wyoming, the wheat fields ofKansas, and other similar places. But if you get out and walk these areas, thereare millions of folds in the ground, some bushes, holes, and dry streambedswhere many people could hide from ground observation. Standing up and movingwould be instantly detected by anyone looking into that area, but hide sites doabound.It would also help if your clothes were the same color as the surroundingvegetation. Keep in mind that hide sites that are detected can be moved on andsurrounded, so careful selection and minimum to no movement during daylighthours is imperative. Another thing the individual should do when picking anyremote site is spending the time to find one with water, game, hills, andvegetation that will support his intentions. The time and money spent doing thiswill pay dividends in the future.If an individual is going to make the decision to go it alone if disasterstrikes, he has taken on a monumental challenge that will ultimately end indisaster. Luck and skill has a lot to do with it. American history is full ofstories about lone mountain men who survived against incredible dangers by luck,skill, and their personal daring. I do not take the lone lifestyle, but ifothers do then I say good travels and good luck—just make sure you plan andprepare.image [../Images/87-1.jpg]Some terrain looks like nothing could hide in it. The wheat fields of Kansas isone such place that comes to mind. (Ricardo Reitmeyer, courtesy of iStock)One thing that happens a lot in critical situations is that group members willget split up from the main group. All group members should know this may happenas a result of losing your way, getting separated in the dark, as a result of agunfight, inclement weather, or a myriad of other things. The bad news is thatwhether it takes hours, days, or weeks to regain contact with the group, you arealone and surviving as a lone person—all of the things we have discussed in thischapter may begin to affect you to some extent, most assuredly if it’s winterand people are looking to do you harm. This is why I have stated that whentraveling outside the survival location, you should be carrying what you need tosurvive and protect yourself for at least three days, or seventy-two hours.Failure to follow that simple combat rule could mean you do not make it throughthe night.A fatal mistake made throughout history by men in critical situations is toassume that you can cut corners and not take everything required. Men have diedand military units have been destroyed or hurt badly by those assumptions. Allshould be aware that in critical situations, things will go wrong—probably atthe worst possible time. As in most things in life, failure to use good sense ornot following the rules will ultimately get you in trouble. In survivalsituations, it could mean a fatal error. This could be an error that is not seenbecause of assumptions, such as:• We are only going a short distance and will be back in an hour.• I do not need my warm clothes because we will be moving.• I can leave my pack here, as we will not need what’s in it.Now that you are separated from the group and herded away from the survival siteby looters, it’s getting dark and it’s below zero. You are alone without theright clothes, the ability to start a fire, or shelter from the cold and wind.The initial assumption was bad. The violation of leaving equipment behind willmost likely prove fatal, but the assumption always makes sense until things gowrong or not as planned.This scenario has played itself out many times in the past with soldiers incombat, hunters in remote areas, backpackers in mountain states—all haveperished from making the incorrect decision or not following establishedprotocols. If disaster strikes and you are forced to travel outside the survivallocation, never do so without your total survival and protective gear.Seventy-two hours is not long, but it is more than enough time to kill you underadverse conditions if you have not prepared correctly. People reading this mightthink this is a little harsh, but I will say to those people if you have notlived it and had to endure it, believe me, it is not harsh. It is sound tacticaland survival advice, as I have no dog in anyone’s fight except my own. If youbreak the rules in critical situations, you will pay the price. Ask anyprofessional."},{"pageContent":"Chapter FiveGetting ReadyIf you are extremely wealthy and can buy and stock your urban or rural locationto make it into an impregnable fortress, then life is good, go do it. But, keepin mind that no matter how much you stock up, eventually you will run out andhave to get your hands dirty. For the rest of us, if we are already preparingand planning, we are on the road to getting where we think we need to go. Forthose among us that are just waking up to the fact that some preparation is agood idea, you have a daunting task in front of you. If you don’t have the fundsto get what you need immediately, you are looking at a task that will take sometime and require good organization, planning, and focus.In saying that, the first thing most regular folks who are living paycheck topaycheck have to do is make some tough decisions. If I have to get certainitems, what can I cut every week to get what I need to start preparing? Firstmake an inventory of what you have. No matter what you get or have in yourpossession now, if disaster strikes you are going to have to defend yourself andwhat you have with your current supplies. If you live in an urban area, this maybe quicker than you think. In most storm-related disasters, looting has startedduring the storm. If you are one of the antigun group and a person who believesin the good of their fellow man—I will be as politically correct as I canhere—get some guns and ammunition you damned idiot. There, I have put somepolitical correctness into this book. If you own guns, this is a startregardless of what type they are. Make sure they work and you have cleaning gearfor them, as well as ammunition.My recommendation is to start buying a box of ammunition for your currentlyowned guns every week or month. Have the people in your group who own guns dothe same. Do a group inventory of what you have on hand now and available to thegroup if disaster happens in the near future. The group may be in better shapethan you think. Put all ammunition in packs that can be picked up and movedquickly. You read my weapon suggestions in Chapter One[../Text/006_Chapter001.html], but do not spend a lot of money you do not have.Sometimes pawnshops have some of the cheapest guns; get a good combat pistolwith extra magazines and a shotgun if you do not have one. Another thing isknives, which you will use as tools and maybe defensive weapons. Look first inyour kitchen knife drawer; most of us have knives that would be excellent in asurvival situation.We will talk more about what knives and tools you may need later in thischapter. As a side note, if you pick some kitchen knives for survival work, youwill need to make or buy sheaths to carry them safely. As you prepare and goover the lists in this book and on the Internet, the group needs to determinewhat items are needed and who in the group can procure them. This will keep thegroup, which may be short on funds, from buying twenty sledgehammers when twowould do it.The next thing is food. You are already buying food, so start buying an extrabag of dry beans, rice, or canned food. Rotate the canned food, and continue toeat the oldest cans first. Continue to buy extra nonperishable food that can beprepared by adding water. There are many survival tips on how to do this on thewebsites for the Department of Homeland Security and FEMA, in addition to someexcellent survival blogs.This will be an ongoing protocol. If this were a perfect world, and I know it’snot, all nonperishable foods would come in or be put into packs or boxes foreasy movement. Keep in mind what you have stored for survival versus yourability to move it. For example, if you have enough equipment to fill a pickuptruck and you own a Volkswagen, you do not have the room to pack what you haveto move. This needs to be looked at from the group level, as well. Can we moveourselves and our supplies with the vehicles we have? If the answer is no, whatare the group’s options? One answer may be pooling money for a biggervehicle—think a truck with four-wheel drive. The best trucks would be militarytrucks that come up for sale at different venues. Do not buy these blindly—golook at them and make sure you are not purchasing a vehicle that has reached theend of its days and will not survive the trip to your rural survival site. Wewill talk more about this later—right now I am trying to get some thinking goingfor an inexperienced group.The next thing is water. There is a lot of good advice on the storage of water.If you are planning to get out of town when disaster strikes, filling up yourbathtub with water is a waste of time, but you should still do it in case ofunplanned changes. I am an old guy who says store it in five-gallon cans, rotateit at least twice a year by watering your plants or washing your car, and keepit out of direct sunlight. Also, if water is cut off with no notice, are therewater sources near you that can provide water? Any water obtained from lakes,streams, or ponds should be boiled before drinking; if it’s muddy it should befiltered until clear.This book is on how to Survive While Surviving and how to prepare to do it. Howto do it is already so available and redundant that I would be wasting my time,as well as yours, by putting it into this book. The next thing is the making offire, and most people will buy lighters or matches. In my experience, iflighters are stored long term, the fuel will eventually leach out, especiallyafter being used. Standard matches should not be bought. Sporting goods storesand survival shops sell matches that can be used under adverse conditions andare packed in weatherproof wrappings; these are what should be purchased andstored for emergency use.I suggest rereading the list in Chapter Three [../Text/008_Chapter003.html] toreview what equipment is needed. These are lists to make an individual or groupthat is planning to survive sit down and think about what they will need toaccomplish the stated tasks. Keep track of what you are acquiring and storingversus your capability to move it. Remember, if it’s a planned move, do you havethe vehicle space to move it in one load? If you are not planning to move andare going to use your residence as your survival location, what is the plan ifyou are forced out by extreme circumstances?Extreme Circumstances• Riots in your neighborhood.• Your house is set on fire by looters.• Flooding or wildfires in the area where you live.• Time goes by and your resources are depleted.• Sickness and diseases are breaking out due to sanitation failure.You get the idea. Whatever it is that forces you to move is irrelevant. It hasforced a move with all its attending circumstances, many of which are discussedin Chapter Three [../Text/008_Chapter003.html]. Let’s keep on the track of theregular guy and his family preparing. I have no idea what room is available toeach individual who has decided to do some preparation, but I am assuming thatif they are living in anything like a one- to three-bedroom structure, storageroom will be at a premium. I know people who have made some hard decisions, suchas designating their cellar, one of their bedrooms, or their garage as the placethey will store what they are gathering. If they plan on staying in theirresidence as their survival location, this will work as long as they are notforced out by circumstances previously discussed.If they are planning to move to another location when disaster strikes and theyhave a vehicle to load it into, will they have time to do this once things starthappening? The best tactical and speedy move-out thinking would be to haveeverything loaded into a designated vehicle bought just for that purpose, thoughI fully realize financial circumstances might prevent this. I have no goodsuggestions other than if you have a group, consider pooling funds to get thevehicles the group needs. One of the givens is that if each member or family isstocking up, each would need a vehicle to load the equipment into. One option isthat one truck serves part of the group members, and as nonperishable stores areacquired, the designated truck for that group picks up the stores and parks at adesignated member’s residence. Good planning would have the fuel tank filledafter every time the truck is used. A locking cap can be put on the fuel tankand the battery should be removed when parked to prevent theft. The cargocompartment should also be secured and even alarmed. During the acquiring ofstores, no one outside of the group or individual should know anything aboutwhat is taking place. With money being short, the preparation process will takelonger, and the individual or group member will have to balance purchases so allrequirements are being equally attended to.In a group, it will most likely be beneficial if specific members focus oncertain supplies and the group holds periodic inventories. This is made easierif all members keep a running inventory. There are several ways this preparationmay be accomplished, but I would suggest they be planned, organized, andconstantly monitored by the group or individual. There should be nothing packedthat is perishable. If any time goes by and it spoils, all you will be doing ismoving stores you cannot use.image [../Images/93-1.jpg]Multi-tools are a must in a survival situation. (Dale C.Spartas/http://www.spartasphoto.com [http://www.spartasphoto.com])When you have a little extra money, start looking at tools that will assist inthe work you will have to do during survival times. Multi-tools, such as Gerberor Leatherman products, are a must. There will be many uses for small cuttingblades, saws, pliers, and such, and to have them in one tool on your belt is agood thing. Take a look at the lists of what you will have to do. Let’s takewood gathering for example. At the end of the skull session, you should have alist of equipment.Wood Gathering• Axe: how many?• Hatchet: how many?• Saw: how many and what type?• Machete: how many?• Sharpening stones and files: what type?• Pry bars: what type and how many?• Extra handles for axes and hatchets: how many?• Maul or manual splitter: what type and how many?• Transport cart: what type and how many?• Tie-downs and come-a-longs: what type and how many?• How many cords of wood will I need for warmth through the winter?• How much wood will I need for cooking, washing, and cleaning?• How and where do I store it?• How do I keep it dry?• Should I have a woodstove for heat and cooking?• Can I cook and warm from the same fire pit?Let’s say this list is complete—do you see how quickly the load will grow? Ifyou do this with the rest of the list, you will be amazed—and maybe a littleintimidated—at how much work is in your future to ensure your survival. If youhave a computer, the study of tools to assist you is only a finger touch away,or a visit to Home Depot or any logging supply store will answer all yourquestions. In a following chapter, I will provide websites that will assist youin your research and procuring the right equipment.If the group is planning correctly, all equipment needs will be of equalimportance. Money spent must give the group or individual full value andcapability. It is sad but true, but in the procurement of equipment you get whatyou pay for. Saving money to get a piece of equipment that will not hold upunder use and will break easily means you still wasted your money.Take another look at what I just explained. You can spend money on cheap piecesof equipment, and they will last you a long time—if not used. I buy goodequipment, so let’s take my axes for example. I live in a rural state, but timesare good and I am not in a survival situation. My axes have been in the garageunused for months, and they are lasting a long time. If I were in a survivalsituation and was cutting wood to prepare for winter, cooking, and cleaning, Imight be using them daily or at least a few times a week. If they were not goodsteel with composite handles, they would not be around long and I would not beable to get good sustainable firewood without repairing them. Keep in mind thereason for this book is to Survive While Surviving. Woodcutting is a minimum ofa two-man job if done correctly—one member cuts firewood while one memberwatches his back.Also keep in mind, while doing anything in a survival situation where violenceis possible, that no matter how good you are at securing yourself and conductinga tactical move, there are millions of people in the country who are trained bythe military or playing paintball that are very good at sneaking up on someoneor ambushing them while they are moving. Moving from paintballs to real bulletsis an easy transition. For anyone reading this book with no training in what weare talking about who is worried, a good time-saver is finding an ex-militaryveteran who was in combat arms, another who was an engineer, and another who wasa medic or doctor. That would be a good start to a group you would want to bein. But also keep in mind that all the good things we have available to us nowmostly came to us in the last hundred and fifty years. We managed to survivebrutal times, such as devastating winters and raiders or armies that were tryingto kill us, for fifty or sixty thousand years with what we were carrying on ourbacks or had squirreled away wherever we were living or hiding. The problem isthat no one living in the present knows how to survive under those conditionsunless they are both trained and prepared. One more time: if you haven’t startedgetting ready, start now. The clock is ticking.It’s easy for someone like me to say to pick a group or people for a group. Ihave talked with people who have asked how you pick the right people. In thepreparation phase, this is usually difficult and time-consuming. If you areasked to join a group that is already preparing, that’s easy. If you are lookingfor good people, spend time with them. If you have an initial feeling uponmeeting them of dislike or mistrust, that feeling comes from within and isprobably correct; they are not for your group.If you feel good about them but during preparing or training they do not want tomake the effort, they are not for your group. It’s a given that people who willnot be there for you when times are good will definitely not be there for youwhen times are bad. I am a combat veteran, and I would rather have no oneguarding my back in a fight—at least I would know—than to have somebody backthere who I am depending on but is not doing his job or has abandoned hisposition. That is a good way to be killed in some situations. Being alone is agood way to get killed in some situations, but at least you know the rules andcan act accordingly.Short-Term Disasters That Are Easy to Prepare For• Major storms—hurricanes, tornados, etc.• Floods• Earthquakes• Wildfires• Major landslides• Other major natural disastersAny of these will be short-term as far as the resumption of emergency servicesis concerned. By this I am talking about police, fire, medical, and all theassociated services we enjoy in this country. We always hear of people who donot have their houses repaired months after an event because their insuranceclaims are unpaid so they are still in shelters. But they have food, clothing,warmth in the cold, and all available reinstated emergency services. Based onhistorical facts in this country and around the world, I will say if you have agun, ammunition, food, and water to keep you for a week, you will be okay.This book is about having to do without services of any kind for a year or more.Some facts that most survival experts agree on are that if you have to survive aweek or so, you need to be prepared as we have discussed. They also recommendgetting a generator for light and, if you have warning of water being shut off,to fill your bathtub and any containers you have. This is all good advice andwill make your life easier for a short period of time. If you are planning onleaving, you should still fill your bathtub in case you cannot get out. Alsoremember your water heater is full of water that will assist you in a survivalsituation. If the power is out, you should keep some cash for emergency buys, asATMs will not be working. I also recommend keeping an emergency stash of anymedications you may need, but in the end this is not really critical survival inmy mind, as I have had times where I have been snowed in and trapped in my housefor this amount of time.The survival data I have read and some experiences I have had around the worldverify that if for whatever reason you have to survive for a month with noservices, you have severe problems that you do not have in the short term. Oneother thing, and I have been there many times, is that if you cannot turn onyour tap and get water, you have some issues. If you have stored a supply ofwater for drinking, this is good. Hopefully you will have enough for sanitationpurposes. If this is not the case, you may have to find water and then filter orpurify it. In this case, a good filtration system is required. There are somegood ones out there, and we will provide the websites later in this book. Duringthis time, you will also need some tools to do things that will come up, and Ibelieve basic carpentry tools will carry you through this time. You or familymembers may need basic medical attention. Most survival books recommenddifferent emergency medical kits. This is good advice, but do not get a medicalkit without the training to use it. If you have a generator, you should startrationing fuel right away. Fuel will be hard to come by a month into a totalservices shutdown. The upside of a generator is you have light when you need it.The downside is any light during a power outage is going to attract unwantedattention.Do not go anywhere at this time without protection. Start thinking tacticallyand making tactical moves—at this time zombies will be prowling. I know peoplewho own guns who say, “I don’t think I could kill somebody.” Believe me, nineout of ten of these types will. All wars have conscientious objectors—most ofthem medics. I have seen this personally, and war stories are full of thesegentle people. When caught in close combat where enemy troops overrun theirposition, they go bat shit crazy, pick up a fallen soldier’s weapon, and becomekilling machines to protect themselves and their charges. It is a given thatwhen people survive life-threatening situations, it changes their outlook on howlife should be forever. If the situation goes long term—a month ormore—especially if winter is in full swing, all services are cut off, and nofuel is available, the need for acquiring firewood will become paramount, mostlikely before the end of thirty days. If you have no means of heat, it willbecome critical immediately. Also, where are you going to burn it? A fire in themiddle of your living room floor will quickly become a house-destroying fire. Ifyou are on your game in preparing, you would have bought a kit and chimney pipesfor a fifty-five-gallon drum that can quickly, with minimal carpentry skills,become a wood-burning stove.I have sat in people’s living rooms and talked about this and been asked bypeople sitting in a wooden house with a detached wooden garage, a wooden fencearound the yard, and wooden furniture throughout the house, “Where am I going toget wood? We have no trees here.” After I explain to them what wood isavailable, I generally hear, “I wouldn’t have thought of that.” With this inmind, do you think some training and preparation drills would be a good thing?Every tree that was cut down to build the local houses is still there, they arejust in the shape of construction lumber, but this is still burnable, as soonafter disaster many of those houses will be empty or abandoned. One of thebenefits of tearing down these houses for firewood, besides keeping you warm, isit increases your ability to see farther and gives you better fields of fire inthe event of an attack on your location. It will not be lost on other survivorsthat where there is smoke there is fire, and where there is fire there iswarmth. You will attract many unwanted visitors.It is easy for experienced people to forget where they come from. Fifty-plusyears ago when I came into the army, I knew nothing about what I have alreadywritten in this book. Now fifty-plus years with a varied and sometimes excitingcareer behind me, I can write this book and try not to forget where I came from.To most civilians reading this book, they will be seeing this information forthe first time. Even in this dangerous world, until 9/11 we lived in a fairlyprotected society. You only have to look at the terror and thousand-yard stareson the crowds running from the World Trade Center or the Pentagon after theplanes hit to see how a disaster of epic proportions will affect the majority ofour population. I will say during those events, a lot of civilians stood up andjumped in to help, and that will happen in any disaster. But take a look at thepathetic events in New Orleans after Katrina, and you see how unprepared ourpopulation is. It should not be lost on anyone that the government, which issupposed to have our backs, failed in quickly supporting some of our nation’ssingular national disasters. How well do you think they will do in a nationwidedisaster?If you have to survive from six months to somewhere past the year mark, totalpreparation must take place for you to have any chance of surviving. Things aregoing to start happening that you may not have thought of. During this time youwill have been working hard, defending yourself and your supplies, and movingthrough littered streets or over rough terrain. In those six months, severalthings that will impact you, as well as the group you may have around you, willbegin to take place.Things to Prepare For• Clothes will be worn out or starting to wear out and will have to bereplaced or repaired.• Shoes and boots will need to be replaced or repaired.• If not maintained, weapons will begin to jam or break down.• Tools will break and have to be fixed or replaced.• Vehicles, if working, will have no fuel.• Food and water supplies will be depleted.• Hunting, fishing, and gathering will have to supplement your diet or becomeyour diet.• Major medical problems will present themselves.• If in a winter area, warmth will become mandatory.• Water purification will, as it always will be in a survival situation,become critical.• Sanitation, both personal and in the living area, will become critical.If groups or individuals do not prepare for these things prior to the event,they will never get accomplished to the level needed after disaster strikes. Abig part of preparation is stashing barter material for use when things getdesperate. Bartering is always dangerous; it could be a trap and should belooked on as a tactical operation. Things that would be gold-like in a bartersituation are food and water, of course, weapons or ammunition—never trade bothat the same time—batteries, rope, wire, tie-downs, tools, and whatever peopleare requesting. I have stated before: never defend yourself and then leave theindividuals’ guns and ammunition behind. That also goes for equipment, clothes,and footwear. All are bartering or personal survival items. Going to bartershould be rehearsed, considered an unknown situation that could go bad, andcovered by other group members.image [../Images/100-1.jpg]Events like those that took place in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina revealjust how unprepared our population is when disaster strikes. (sandoclr, courtesyof iStock)That may sound paranoid, but there are a lot of people in this country whocannot be trusted in good times, so they will not be better people in bad times.In this instance, if a group of armed people comes in to barter, the chance of afight breaking out is diminished. If the barterers are bad people, they willwait for a group or individual they can handle. I also believe if they are badthe word will be out. A lot of barter societies consider the barter site neutralground that benefits all, and that should be the main rule for starting a bartersociety. Barter societies have worked in places such as Bosnia, Somalia,Afghanistan, Russia, China, Rwanda, and many others around the world. They willwork here if disaster strikes.While preparing for disaster, many individuals and groups make unrealistic plansfor moving to a survival location. I am comfortable with going to a remotelocation that will allow me to get there on a single tank of fuel, and I can dothat where I live. I have friends who cannot do this, and I suspect there aremany others planning to go to a place in the country. I have a friend who islooking at a seven-hundred-mile trip to his property of choice. With his currentvehicles, he would have to refuel two or three times if he wanted a near-fulltank when he arrived.If he just loads his guns, ammunition, and tools he plans on taking, hisvehicles will be full. No water, food, or other survival gear will fit. When Ipointed this out to him, a kind of panic set in, and for the first time hestarted thinking properly on what he needed to do. I questioned him on the landhe had bought at a good price—and it is a good piece of land with game on it,and it will be defendable with a little work. The biggest problem is that thenearest water source is two miles away and not on his property. This is no bigdeal, but once disaster strikes he is looking at a four-mile round trip to haulwater at more than eight pounds a gallon. Currently there is no road to thewater source. This is going to tie people up every day, summer or winter, andtake away from other work that may be important to the survival of the group.The bottom line is that he focused on some land he wanted but not enough on whathe might require on it. When looking for land in a rural or remote setting, donot buy land that is going to increase what will already be a staggeringworkload just to survive. There are a lot of questions that come up about how tofund preparation. Families have to spend quality time together—it is what makesfamilies strong and brings them happiness. One thing that can be done is to makepreparation a family project and use the money that would be spent on certainoutings to start procuring what you need. I will give you an example, and youcan review what your family does. We have a four-year-old grandson, and in hismind he is a Ninja Turtle, as are millions of other four year olds. When thelatest Ninja Turtle movie came out, he saw the previews on TV. From that minuteon, it was a constant “We need to see this movie, when are we going?” We tookhim, my wife, and a couple other family members. At the end of the night, withmovie, snacks, and parking, we spent one hundred and ten dollars. Had we waitedfor it to come out on DVD, we would have had that money to buy neededpreparatory equipment. I suspect in every family’s lives, savings like that arepossible. I am not saying preparation is all you should focus on, but I knowthere is money being spent that could be better spent getting ready for yourneeds if disaster strikes. Once it does strike—and it’s when, not if—the game ison, and you start with what you have.Let’s take a look at some good advice given in survival magazines for along-term survival situation. One is to grow a garden as time goes by. This isgood advice, and everybody nods their heads and collects and stores seeds to usewhen disaster strikes. I have heard no one ask valid questions that should beplanned for during preparation—no matter if you live in a rural or urban area.Good advice—grow a garden!Questions to Consider During Planning• Where do I plant it if I live in the city?• Where do I plant it on my rural property?• What do I need for tools?• If water is scarce, where do I get it?• How do I fertilize it?• Once it starts to produce, how do I guard it?• What materials need to be on hand to preserve vegetables for later meals?I have seen good advice given in many survival venues but little on what growinga garden really means in a survival situation after disaster. For example, ifyou do not guard it, how do you stop people from stealing from it? If water isscarce, how do you have enough to keep the garden alive and producing? Let’stake a look at reality and some things that will impact you once you plant agarden. Depending on where you live, the growing season will be at least two tothree months and much longer in some parts of the country if weather cooperatesand the garden is well tended. Where do I plant it in the city? The safestoption would be that if your survival location is a building with a flat roof,plant it there. People do this as we speak with no issues. The problem ofguarding it comes up if the roof can be readily accessed from adjoiningbuildings. If you do not guard it and people know of it, you will end up growingit for looters. Hiding it may not be an option on the roof if surroundingbuildings are taller than the one you are occupying.I think you see this problem clearly; you will have the same problem if you havea yard and plant it there. If it can be seen, hungry people will loot it. Youalso need to be as sure as you can that you will not be run out of your locationby looters or raiders. It may sound funny to normal people, but planting agarden in a survival situation where looters and raiders are present placesanother tactical requirement on the group. Another issue is watering it if wateris scarce, such as in a drought. Any pool of stagnant water that is not full ofindustrial waste can be used to water the garden, and with that being said, partof your preparation should have been the procuring of as many barrels as you canhaul and sheets of plastic. If used properly, these barrels and plastic sheetswill give you tons of extra water every time it rains. In tests in a perfectsetting, a single day of moderate rain filled ten fifty-five-gallon barrels.If we had more plastic sheeting and barrels, we could have filled as many as wewanted. In heavy rain, we would have more water than we wanted. This test wasdone in a state where it does not rain as much as it does in other states. Oncethe barrels are full, they need to be covered to prevent evaporation. I can tellyou that if you are in a true survival situation, you will never have enoughbarrels and containers. Never let a rainstorm go by without washing yourselfthoroughly. Take down the plastic sheeting after you stock up on water, as thesun and wind will eventually make it fall apart. Sheet metal roofs anddownspouts on buildings can also be used to capture water. These are the typesof questions that should be skulled by the group when deciding what to procurefor the coming long-term disaster. I will also remind you to hang your plasticsheeting over barrels where you want the barrels to be. A fifty-five-gallon drumof water weighs four hundred and fifty-eight pounds, so you are not going to beable to move it easily.During the preparation phase, there is the question of whether you will have tosee at night. That answer is a resounding yes. First we need to look atbatteries and what they will do for us. The survival manuals and schools saystock up on batteries, and this is, of course, good advice. I have packs ofDuracell batteries that say they are guaranteed for ten years in storage. Thatcertainly is a long enough time for us to come back from disaster. If we’re notback, it will not matter. I have other data that says alkaline batteries aregood for seven years in the package, so the time would be impacted by how longthey were in storage before they were sold. Manufacturers say batteries are bigbusiness and they sell fast. There are good and bad flashlights out there, butall break or quit on you sooner or later. You will need several of all the kindsyou determine you will need. All flashlights have information on how long abattery will last under heavy use, so it is a simple matter to determine whatthat time is and procure the amount of batteries you think you will need, aswell as spare bulbs. Will this put you in possession of a truckful of batteries?It will if you can afford them. One thing I am certain of is that no matter howmany you procure, you will eventually run out if the situation lasts long term.My recommendation for flashlights is any military- or industrial-grade light. Ihave used them every night during my career since they have been in existence.Lights are like everything else, you get what you pay for, but you will need toget what you can afford. There are also light sticks. These are in a packagethat you simply open and then bend the stick until you break a vial. The sticklights up to provide low- to high-intensity light for hours. They are ofone-time use but provide good emergency light in several colors.One thing to remember is that if violence is taking place in your area, lightsalso become the enemy. They give away your location and make you an easiertarget. You will be living in a parallel universe of survival needs and tacticalrequirements. Let’s look at another question we should be skulling in ourpreparation phase.Will I have to clean myself and the living area? Yes.Necessary Equipment• Soap: body and dish• Hot water• Toothpaste, brushes, mouthwash, toothpicks, and floss• Bleach• Bon Ami, Ajax, or similar cleaning powder• Hydrogen peroxide• Ammonia• Vinegar• Pine-Sol• Baking soda• Containers for carrying water and washing• Rags and sponges• Brushes, mops, and brooms• Trash cansThis list can certainly be added to, but you are going to be operating in asurvival situation. You will need as much as you can get, but this requiresstorage room and, if moving, room in the vehicles making the move. Failure tokeep good cleaning habits will result in disease that could wipe out a city ifit gets out of control. There is going to be a problem of contaminated water,especially in cities, which in itself will cause disease. An important part ofcleaning is purifying water.Failure to keep good sanitation standards will result in internal parasites,lung congestion, rashes, tooth decay, and many other sicknesses. Put thoseproblems against a population that may be suffering from mild to criticalmalnutrition and dehydration and you have a recipe for disaster that willthreaten all life in the area. Let’s take a dose of reality and look at what ispotentially a real scenario. Disaster strikes nationally, power is out, and mostpeople are out of communication.If you live in a large city, how many people in that city depend on life supportprovided by electricity? I do not know the answer to any particular city, butsoon after disaster strikes, bodies are going to start piling up. Looting willstart quickly in the majority of short-term disasters. I see no reason it willnot start quickly in the situation we are talking about. This looting, as alllooting does, will have violence attached to it, which will result in morebodies piling up.A day or two into a long-term survival situation, there will be bodies that, ifthey are not removed, will attract rats and other animals and quickly become adisease threat. With emergency services disrupted and out of touch with thepopulace, who removes and burns or buries these bodies that have to be takencare of to prevent disease? We can only hope that the existing governmentestablishes some semblance of order and concerned citizens step up and starttaking care of this critical business. While taking care of this business, thepeople doing it will probably have to create a few more bodies by shooting someof the village idiots who will be trying to take what they have.If you look at the studies of how much of the population will die if this eventhappens, we’re in serious trouble. Just the thought of what may happen alongthese lines is reason to get out of town quickly. If you look at the Ebolaproblem in West Africa, there are reports from the capital of Liberia of bodieslying unattended in the streets. Things will get much worse if they are notattended to. This chapter on preparation is important in that it gets you tothink, and that is the chapter’s intent. Do not forget when reading this chapterthat you will be living in a parallel universe. When answering the questionsthis chapter presents, think about what tactical requirements are raised by whatyou decide.Let’s try another question. Will I have to tell direction? Yes.Necessary Equipment• Maps• Compass• GPS• Training in land navigationAs you forage and gather certain game and materials, you will have to go fartherand farther from your survival location, and you may be forced to travel atnight or under cloud cover. We live in the Northern Hemisphere, so if you cansee the sun and know what time it is, you can roughly tell the cardinaldirections of north, east, south, and west. You can do the same thing at nightif you have clear skies and can see the Big Dipper and the North Star. If youare under cloud cover and have a GPS with working batteries, navigation is noproblem. If you do not have GPS and have a cloud cover, a compass is mandatoryto figure out cardinal directions and which way you should go. Those of youplanning to head for the hills will find that losing direction in the dark inthe middle of the woods is guaranteed. If you do not have a compass, you willnever find the area you are looking for. Traveling most of the night in thewrong direction will put you miles off course.To make sure you know what you are doing, a class on compass use would do youwell. All Boy Scouts know how to use a compass, and so do many militaryveterans. When using a compass, you need to keep track of the direction you gowhen leaving your location, and that should be planned. Maps are handy, and youshould have one. Learning to read a map is also strongly recommended. I havestated the redundancy in all survival data that holds true for learning how toread a map and compass. If disaster strikes, we are going to be sent back intime anywhere from one hundred years to the Stone Age. How well we have preparedand what survives the disaster will make the difference. But as we speak, we arein the age of total, instant information, and contact with schools andinstructors is only a finger touch away. I will not waste time duplicating orplagiarizing data that is already at your fingertips. Now if you are lazy andwon’t do the work to learn, it would not matter if it were in this book becauseyou wouldn’t do the work from what you read here. You also will probably notsurvive anyway—few lazy people do in any critical situation.When using a compass, you should travel with at least one traveling companion.This is because using a compass focuses a lot of your time on the compass; thesame is true for maps and GPSs. When using any navigational aids in a survivalor tactical situation, someone should be watching your back.If you have gotten this far in the book, you now have many thoughts in yourhead, and that’s good. I cannot tell you enough times how important it is tostay on your guard once disaster strikes. I have been in numerous combatsituations, and I can tell you that you will fall into the trap that most humansdo when on guard. The more time that goes by with nothing going on, the more youwill get bored and lose focus. I can also tell you that people who want to doyou harm can appear like magic inside your personal space and kill you beforeyou can react. You must stay scared, as this will keep you alert. If days go by,not to mention weeks or months, with nothing serious happening, you will getsloppy. Down the road, someone will get to you. Group leaders are the answerhere; tactical discipline must be ongoing and unrelenting. If the leadersthemselves are weak, someone who isn’t will kill the group. Trust me, I havedone it in a couple of war zones to enemy troops who thought they were safe. Donot kid yourself, in a long-term survival situation, you will be in a war zone.I would like to think that there will be large areas where the people pulltogether, help each other, and have some form of organization. That willprobably happen, but while it does, these areas will be under constant threatfrom organized looters and raiders. If people reading this book think I am beingtoo harsh, get on the Internet to see what went on during conflicts in Bosnia,the fighting in Somalia, and Rwanda. In our own country, look at hurricaneKatrina, the Rodney King riots, or Ferguson, Missouri, after a white policeofficer shot and killed a black teenager. Looting and the burning of buildingstook place in spite of a large police presence and a functioning government.Within the smaller communities, the idea of pulling together is already mostlyingrained into people. They check on each other, and if someone has trouble,people are always there to help. I live in a community like that, which I amgrateful for, and it is one of the reasons that I intend to stay here ifdisaster strikes. If things do go bad for whatever reason, I can get into aremote setting quickly. During the preparation part of getting ready, there arecertain things that should become what the military calls standard operatingprocedures (SOPs). As a civilian, you can call them rules.The Rules• Everyone in the group knows what the group is doing.• Do not talk about group business outside the group.• All work and preparation protocol is equally distributed.• Everyone takes designated training that is deemed necessary.• If moving, all routes are physically checked.• Every route has at least one checked alternate route.• All vehicle fuel tanks making the move are kept full.• Critical items are not all put in the same vehicle.• Meet on a group-determined schedule to plan and check inventories.• The meeting and who runs it should be rotated through the group.• Any group member who becomes detrimental to the group is dealt with quickly.• Plan for all plans to fail if the right situation is present, and havebackup plans.This list is to give you ideas and a good start. Depending on your situation andplace of residence, you may want to add to it. Within all groups and communitieswho are getting ready for disaster, there are many good ideas, and everyoneneeds a chance to provide their input. By doing this, groups reduce thealways-present chance of running with a bad idea and wasting time and money. Insaying that, when checking planned alternate routes, you might find that youcannot use it for whatever reason. That’s not wasted time or money—that’ssomething you need to know before you stake your life or the lives of the groupon it.The best use of time needs to be looked at constantly. If CPR training or rangetraining is going to take place in the morning, that afternoon would be idealfor a group planning meeting. Save time and get more accomplished anytime youcan. One thing that ensures the success of the group is the monitoring of allgroup members. If a group member is not completing his or her givenresponsibilities or is missing meetings and training, they are part of theproblem, not the solution, and get rid of them quickly. That individual will notimprove when things go bad. I have talked a little about this in differentchapters, and I am serious as death on this subject. If a member is not 100percent dedicated to saving the group’s lives, he or she is not needed by thegroup.If it is a family group, this decision will be the most difficult, but any wayit goes, the family must make the ultimate decision. Any decision made in familygroups will cause some hard feelings. The only thing I will say here is that ifa bad decision is made at the family level, that will not be a first. If itdestroys the family continuity and the family dies because of it, that will notbe a first either. People will say, “Man, this guy is over the edge.” Ifdisaster has struck and we are all over the edge, we are going to have to makemany unwanted decisions. These decisions should always be made to benefit themany.I do not expect the millions of people who have not been in life-threatening orlife-altering experiences to understand this, but everyone has the survival genein them to one degree or another. I also think that, like conscientiousobjectors previously discussed, most will make the right decisions. At anylength, I have no stake in these families or groups, so I can only wish you luckand Godspeed in making the right decisions.With the above being said, let’s go back to group preparations. We talked aboutthe actual traveling to your rural site by the routes you have chosen. I havefriends that must initially travel on interstates to get in close proximity totheir chosen sites, and unless we have a major flood, earthquake, or somedisaster that closes these roads, they will most likely be open. If we lose thepower grid and riots break out in cities along the primary route, we can divertto our secondary route if we received news of this over our survival radios.This is where most people make a serious mistake by not actually going to theirrural site by driving this route. If something happens to close both yourprimary and secondary routes of travel, you may have to start your survivalcareer in a place not of your choosing.If this should happen, there are several options available to you. One is tostart survival operations where you are and monitor your survival radio forinformation that the routes are open. Be prepared for that not to happen. If youare blocked by circumstances, a group plan and action meeting needs to takeplace, but remember you are now in a survival and tactical situation. The gistof this meeting should be whether, based on the route you have taken, this isthe best place to start out or if there was a place along the route that wouldbe better. For instance, if you are in an area of little vegetation and noobservable water but you have an area behind you with forests and a river, thismove is a no-brainer. Once you make the move back to the better area, an onboardfuel check needs to be made to determine how far you can get from this point ifcircumstances force a move.At this point maps should come out and at least two plans should be put in placein the event of another forced move. We have talked about the followingstatement previously in this book. Know where you are going, how you are getingthere, and what equipment you need. Once settled, a good move would be to findout if you are on state or federal land. This would be good, as when disaster ona national level hits there is basically no state or federal anything takingplace. If it’s private property, try to find the owner—or he or she may findyou—and work a deal with them along the lines of, “If you give us permission tostay here and you need help, we will give it to you.” They would be foolish tonot take that deal, but in the case that they don’t, you should have two plansto facilitate your next move.I am told by people who have read this book that what I am saying is valid, butI am expecting normal people to put in a huge effort to accomplish what we aretalking about. I’m telling you what will happen if disaster strikes and what youneed to do to have a chance of surviving. My job is to write this book, but whatyou do with the information in it is your call. In the end I am confident thatpeople who think it might happen will start preparing. The rest get what theyget.The lists in this book are solely to assist your planning, but how much fundingyou have to put into it will mean you have either a quick or slow road ahead ofyou. If you have a group that is thinking alike, serious in their intent, and iscomprised of people of varying economic means, the wealthier members should putin a little extra when they can to make this happen. The stronger and moreprepared the group is, the better their chance of survival. The wealthier groupmembers putting in a little extra will make the group stronger. I am sure peoplenaturally understand this, and whatever extra any group member puts in will paydividends starting the second disaster strikes.I have looked at a few people’s preparation efforts, and most were on the righttrack. I have seen a few things that could have been handled better. One ofthese is ammunition storage or the lack of. I have talked with people who haveammunition in open containers, rounds taken out of the manufacturer’s wrapping,and the bullets dumped into open boxes. I am told they will be easier to get inthe middle of a fight. If you are in a fight where quick reload ammunition needsto be on hand, one or more of these three things are happening:• You have made no plans nor taken training in what to do here.• You have only one magazine for your weapon or no speed loaders.• You are alone and in trouble.I am going to throw a word out here: corrosion. Look it up. Dirty or corrodedammunition will jam or damage your guns. First, leave all ammunition in factorypackaging until ready to load it into magazines or guns. Second, if you getmilitary ammunition cans to put your ammunition into, leave it in the factoryboxes and put those into the military cans. Third, store the ammunition in acool dry place. If you cache it, use self-sealing boxes that are made to keepfood fresh. Keep the ammunition in the factory boxes when placing it in the foodstorage containers, and add a small desiccant bag in each food storage box. Thecache should be located in as dry a place as possible. Although the food boxesare waterproof, I always spray the seal line with bed liner or plastic sealant.Square PVC tubing that can be capped on each end has also been a winner for me.People living in different locations need to experiment to see what works forthem. A good reference found easily on the Internet is a book by my old friendRagnar Benson called Modern Weapons Caching.How do we get by without an emergency grab for ammunition to reload our gunswith? Combat reloads are important, and training and practice will make youproficient at it. This is my take on how to not have to emergency reload. I haveat least ten magazines on my survival belt. I have different automatic pistolson three survival belts, and they all have ten magazines on them. My assaultrifle has ten magazines on my combat harness.Our group training revolves around the scenario that we are in a fight at oursurvival location and designated shooters have a loader that reloads everymagazine ejected by the shooter. We are also not clairvoyant, so if we areattacked by a zombie horde everyone will be shooting, and we will see who isaround at the end of the fight. Where I live that will not happen, but if thereis a chance it will happen where you live, I suggest you get a couple of machineguns. I am not being facetious here; it is going to get rough, and you need toget as ready as you can. That’s all any of us can do. We will not know where thetrip will take us if disaster strikes until we get there. If outside thesurvival location, never eject an empty magazine and leave it where it fell.Most combat-experienced guys have a dump bag on their gear or a cargo pocketwhere used magazines go. If you eject them and leave them, you will soon runout. As a side note, when you clean your gun, clean your magazines.All long guns should have slings. Get one- or three-point slings so your longgun is attached to you. That way, if you fall down in the dark or have to useboth hands, you don’t have to worry about your gun. Someone should always bewatching your back. With this said, will you ever be alone? The answer is yes. Ilearned as a young soldier about how quickly you can be had. We were on atraining exercise and had been told our weapon was to never leave our hands orreach. I was out of water, and we were by a stream. I walked about ten metersfrom our perimeter and leaned my rifle up against a tree within reach perinstructions. I pulled out my canteen and filled it from the stream. The totaltime was probably less than thirty seconds, but when I turned around to get myrifle, my squad leader was standing there with my gun in hand. I never heard himcome up and take my rifle. His question stayed with me for the rest of my careerand until this day. “What if I was an enemy soldier, asshole?” I have generallystayed an asshole until this day, but I have never forgotten that lesson.People can get inside your personal space and kill you in seconds. Heed myramblings in this book, as your life and the group’s lives may depend on it in asurvival situation. Sooner or later as you acquire stores for your survival, youwill max out your storage or vehicle capacity. This will take place whether youare staying in your house, a group member’s house, or making a move to a rurallocation. At this time, you will need to determine what stores are critical andlifesaving and what stores are nice to have. Make the critical lifesaving storestake priority.Let’s talk about the vehicles, their loads, and how much we put on each truck.It is important to cross-load and not put all the critical items on one truck.We want to make the best use of the space we have, especially on vehicles. In aperfect world, everything packed in the vehicle is in square packaging that canbe stacked with no loss in storage space. I can almost assure you that will nothappen, but you can get close. Now let’s talk about the tactical part of themove. When moving trucks, from pickups to ten tonners, through areas where youmay be attacked, good tactical protocols are as follows:One shooter is in the passenger seat, where he or she can shoot out of thewindow while the vehicle is moving. Four shooters are in the pickup bed and havethe front, right, left, and rear of the truck covered if the vehicle isattacked.However, this is most likely not going to happen. Trucks will probably bealmost, if not completely, overloaded with stores. This is not tactically sound,although undoubtedly realistic, but there are ways to get around this dependingon how large the group is. During preparation before disaster strikes, I assumemost of the group owns their own vehicles. Some probably come from a two-vehiclehousehold, so not counting trucks owned for the move, the group has severalvehicles. Here is where group size is important. If the tactical recommendationabove cannot happen because of group size or lack of vehicles, a group vehiclewith at least three shooters should be in front and in back of each truckcarrying stores. If this is not possible, the group needs to determine if theyhave enough vehicles and people to safely make the move. We are never going toagree on group size when getting ready for disaster and surviving for any lengthof time, as all of us are set in our ways due to our life experiences. The bestadvice I can offer here is that two heads are better than one, andwell-thought-out group decisions will usually be the right one. This does notmean unforeseen circumstances will not interfere once disaster happens.Revisit what I have already written about what makes a functional group. Theremust be enough people in the group to ensure the work can be done to SurviveWhile Surviving without exhausting everyone in it and making the groupineffective. I can make recommendations based on experience, but I also knowcircumstances may force less than desirable actions. Groups are on their ownhere, as they will be when disaster strikes. In the situations we are talkingabout, bigger groups are better, and more jobs to benefit the group can beaccomplished. In saying this, I realize that bigger groups require more food andwater, as well as other resources. I would still like to have a group and takemy chances with one that has enough people to secure it and its location. Therewill never be a perfect situation once disaster strikes, but well-put-togethergroups will have less inner-group friction. Groups will have strong,well-balanced group members, and they will have weaker members with a tendencyto overreact in some cases and underreact in others. Leadership is the answer,as it always is in critical situations.You have read the following before in this book and probably in other books youhave acquired. Good leadership does not mean bad things are not going to happen,it just means that the chances of dealing with them and surviving the encounterare raised in the group’s favor."},{"pageContent":"Chapter SixIndividual Protective EquipmentHistorical references are full of lone individuals and groups of peoplesurviving under terrible life-threatening conditions. Mountain men are famousfor disappearing into remote areas and making it with what they had on theirbacks or pack animals. They made it with equipment that was the most modernavailable at the time. How did they survive without what we have today? That’ssimple—it didn’t exist—but they also had to Survive While Surviving. Can wesurvive without neat equipment that is available to us today? Sure we can—themountain men proved that—but why should we if we do not have to? The equipmentthat currently exists will make our survival more ensured.In previous chapters, I included lists to get you to think about what you mightneed to survive. In this chapter, we will cover some of the equipment that isavailable in these modern times. I am not associated with any company ormanufacturer and have no dog in this fight. Because it is in this book does notmean I am recommending that specific brand. As in all situations in life, youwill have to make your own decisions.We will first discuss weapons and ammunition. If a critical national eventhappens, you will have to protect yourself during everything you do after. Youwill have to Survive While Surviving. Some of the equipment listed in thischapter is expensive, and I understand that budgets will ultimately determinewhat an individual can acquire. Like everything else in all disaster andsurvival thinking and decision-making, hard decisions will be the order of theday. Although there is not much order to this book, I will try to establish somehere by following the list of individual protective gear in Chapter One[../Text/006_Chapter001.html].ShotgunsShotguns are excellent close protection weapons and are recommended for personaland home defense. They are short-range weapons used worldwide with devastatingeffects; the best ammunition for self-defense is buck shot or slugs. For huntinguse, there are bird shot and small game loads. There are shotguns with pistolgrips that make the weapon shorter, but if you are going to use yours forhunting, get one with a full stock and hunting sights. Shotguns are perfect forin-house defense. Almost every police and military unit worldwide uses them.They are one of the best weapons for fighting inside structures and for shortranges, such as under one hundred yards outside.M4s or Assault-Type WeaponsThese are typically calibers of .223/5.56, .308/7.62 rifle rounds. There alsoare knock-offs in 9mm and 10mm, but those are like shooting a pistol bullet outof a rifle—not that it won’t kill someone, but you lose a lot of range and powerthat a rifle bullet provides. AK47s come under the heading of assault rifles, asdo numerous other weapons. Assault rifles come with ten-, twenty-, orthirty-round magazines. Higher capacity magazines are available, but I find themhard to carry. You will have to make your own decision. These weapons requiretraining from professionals, as do all weapons. When you type in “assaultweapons,” your search engine will give you all the information you need. Anothergood search would be manufacturers of assault weapons. You will also find manyaccessories for the M4 and other assault rifles. Many great sights and gunlights are available from numerous manufacturers. I am a fan of gun lights, butmany of the sights available take batteries. Sooner or later, if the situationgoes long term, you will run out of batteries. A good setup for rifles andassault weapons is a scope and iron sights on the weapon. This is my personalchoice, but check out all options and make your own decisions.Note: All long guns need slings, and all weapons need cleaning gear to maintain.Leave ammunition in the factory packaging until ready to load into magazines orweapons. Have extra parts, as weapons will break or eventually wear out.Hunting RiflesThese come in all sizes and calibers for the untrained. You military guys andother shooters really do not have to read this chapter. Use .308 or a similarcaliber, learn to shoot, get comfortable with guns, and see where you want togo. Put a scope on all long guns. There are a lot of battery-powered sights outthere that are good, but in the situation we are talking about, save batteriesfor flashlights, as they are going to get hard to find. Get professionaltraining. As with the assault weapons above, you must make the choice that’sbest for you. I am set in my ways and stick to what I know best, but that doesnot necessarily mean you have to agree..22 Rifles and PistolsFor those of you who are untrained, these guns fire only .22 caliber ammunition.The pistols come as revolvers or automatics. They are great for small game,although you can kill a deer with them and use them for defense. They areexcellent in a survival situation, especially for the individual survivor,because the ammunition is small and light so you can carry a lot of it. If yougo with a rifle and pistol, both should take the same ammunition. These guns areaccurate and easy to shoot. Most kids learning to shoot start out with .22caliber weapons. As this book is being written, there is a shortage of .22ammunition in some areas of the country, and I am told in certain areas you canonly buy two boxes at a time. If that’s the case, that’s the way you buy it.There are always ways to get any ammunition you require.image [../Images/118-1.jpg]Hunting rifles come in all sizes and calibers for the untrained. Make the choicethat’s best for you. (Dale C. Spartas/http://www.spartasphoto.com[http://www.spartasphoto.com])Combat PistolsThere are numerous revolvers and automatic pistols available. I am going to tellyou to go the automatic pistol route in 9mm, 10mm, .40 caliber, or .45. Thereare a lot of good pistol guys out there with good advice, so listen to them ifyou run into them and then make your own decisions. All pistols need a holsterfor carry and cleaning gear for maintenance. In a perfect world, the groupshould all have the same pistols so magazines and ammunition are the same. Whenyou clean your pistol, clean the magazines at the same time. Revolvers aresimpler and require less maintenance. I do not use them for a combat pistol—it’san Army thing.Note: It is good policy that if you have a weapon that takes magazines to usemagazines made by the same company that made the gun. There are a lot ofexcellent aftermarket magazines available, so talk to your instructors and makeyour own decision.Binoculars and FlashlightsThere are so many binoculars, flashlights, and other optical and lightingsystems out there. A book much larger than this one could be written and notcover all of them. They range in price from a few dollars to many hundreds ofdollars. Get what you can afford, but remember that you get what you pay for.For flashlights or anything with a battery, get as many as you can. With bothflashlights and binoculars, do not throw them around or use them as impactweapons, as that will shorten their life. In my career, binoculars andflashlights were used as much as, if not more than, any other piece of equipmentin the field. Carry both in protective pouches.KnivesThere are literally millions of them out there. For the situations we arediscussing in this book, I say each individual needs two good fixed-blade kniveswith blades from six to eight inches, a sheath for carrying them, and a goodfolding knife with about a four-inch blade. Prices vary and so does durabilityand edge holding capability. I personally carry one double-edged knife as one ofthe two fixed blades. I also suggest you take some defensive and offensive knifetraining. I will catch hell here from the safety guys, but when training, usereal knives. Training with rubber knives gives you confidence that falls apartonce facing a real knife. This is my take on it. Is there a chance you can beinjured? Yes. If you are injured and have stitches or deep cuts, do not quittraining or look for sympathy—once disaster happens, you are going into asituation where every round will be a championship round, and you will not beable to lose without losing your life. Train real or pay the price.Note: When shopping for knives, if you pick it up and it doesn’t feel right,that’s not your knife. It’s supposed to feel like it is part of your hand.MachetesThere are many tools like machetes that are called bush knives, as they are usedfor clearing brush, that are a good tool to have. Buy what you can afford. Thebetter the metal they are made of and the stronger the handle, the longer theywill last. They should not be used for breaking rocks, cutting barbed wirefences, or felling large trees. They also do not cut metal telephone poles. Youcan purchase them in most hardware or sporting goods stores. They are also greatdefensive and offensive weapons should the need arise.image [../Images/120-1.jpg]The better the metal the machetes are made of and the stronger the handle, thelonger they will last. (Predrag Vuckovic, courtesy of iStock)Combat HarnessA combat harness is what carries your fighting gear. There are many models. Youneed one that is comfortable to wear—good luck—that will carry your ammunition,knife, and the self-defense gear you will need to secure yourself day to day.Every group member needs one. In your search engine, type in “manufacturers ofcombat harnesses” to see what is available. Do not order one through the mail;you need to try it on before you buy one—your life depends on it.Utility BeltThis is a heavy-duty belt that you would use to carry a few magazines and maybea knife, flashlight, tool, and the things you might want if you ran into troubleand did not have your combat harness. You would also wear it daily just in case.Try them on before you buy them, as you want as much comfort as you can get.RucksackThere are many hundreds of makes and models. Stay away from the school kidbackpack and lean toward military or extreme weather gear. They are going to gethard use, and if not of very good quality, it will wear out quickly. Also,bigger is better, as you will live out of them, especially in a rural area. Thisdoes not mean you should not have smaller packs for different work. Packs shouldfit well and be comfortable—one size or type does not fit all. Packs that arenot comfortable when empty or with little weight will be painful when fullyloaded and carried for any length of time. Sporting goods shops sell them.Pellet GunsI left these out of the real gun list, but these guns are great and almostsilent small game hunters. Do the research and buy a good pellet gun, along witha couple thousand pellets. You can spend less than a hundred dollars and have alifetime of small game rounds. Make sure it has good sights on it and that youget it zeroed. My pellet guns have a velocity of 1250 feet per second. Anotheroption is pellet pistols, and they will also work well on small game. Usingpellet guns for small game saves real bullets for protecting yourself and yoursurvival location. If you get really desperate, you could use pellets to reloadyour shotgun rounds if you have that capability. Draw a life-sized likeness of arabbit or a duck on cardboard and practice until you get really good with thegun. You should also consider getting range help if you need it.Note: Bear, deer, and elk are NOT small game. Rabbits, squirrels, rats, cats,and birds are small game—use pellets.Pellets are ammunition, so do not waste them. Use pellets on small game insteadof using your ammunition for your hunting rifles and M4-type weapons—those arefor large game and self-protection. Pellets and .22 caliber ammunition are forsmall game, although on any day you can kill a deer and protect yourself with a.22.Canteens and Hydro-PacksWhen talking about hydration in a critical situation, I prefer canteens sincethey are more durable than hydro-packs. I have carried the same canteens formany, many years. In that time, I have seen dozens of hydro-packs on my buddiesthat have sprung leaks or had valve problems. There are many people who willdisagree with me, and that is okay. You have to make your own decisions.Whatever you purchase, go the military route, as they are made for extremecircumstances like what you will be in. Keep in mind that my suggestions haveworked for me, but there are a lot of people out there who are smarter and havemore experience, so listen to all instructors and make your own decisions basedon training and experience.ClothesIf we are faced with a long-term disaster, you will need the toughest clothesmade. Work clothes and extreme weather clothes would fit the bill. Repairmaterials for the clothes you have will be needed. You are going to be in hardtimes, and your clothes will be either destroyed or fall apart over time. Checkwork clothes stores or farm supply stores for the toughest over-the-counterclothes. If you find a body with better clothes than you, this will be a gooddeal. If they do not fit you, they may fit another group member or be greatbarter material down the road.BootsThere is no good news here for thin budgets, as you will have to spend money toget good boots. You will need at least two pairs, but more would be better forlong-term survival. Do not throw away your current running shoes or boots thatyou bought at the local everything store, as you will need them when in thesurvival location. If you know police or soldiers, use them as a resource forgood boots. In my experience, they will give you good information. The one thingthat will happen in a survival situation is that everyone is going to becomesomewhat of an infantryman or -woman. One of your most valuable assets will beyour feet—leave no stone unturned in taking care of them.HelmetAny impact-resistant helmet will do: military, motorcycle, bike, etc. Iguarantee if you are hit in the head during your survival travels by a thrownrock or metal pipe, your first—or last—thought will be, I sure wish I had ahelmet on. Go get a good impact helmet. Every group member needs one. Headinjuries are one of the most debilitating complications when living in a time oflittle to no medical care available. Every effort needs to be made to protectyour vital areas from injury, whether man-caused or accidental. I hate helmets,but I wear them when working or in combat situations.Body ArmorAgain, there is no good news for thin budgets. Body armor is expensive, and I donot expect you to run out and get some, as you have a lot more pressing thingsyou need. There is body armor that will stop rifle rounds and pistol rounds;others will stop only pistol rounds. It is good to have and saves lives.Rifle-bullet-stopping body armor is recommended. It is also protective equipmentthat may be the difference between living or dying.Eye ProtectionAll professionals who go to work with guns wear eye protection. There are a lotof options available, and some of them are very expensive. Is it really needed?For those of you who have not been in a gunfight in a building or in a buildinggetting shot at from outside, here is some insider information: fragments, bothhigh and low velocity, in the form of glass, masonry, wood, and bullet jacketsfly around. If hit in the eye with even a low-velocity fragment, at the leastyou have major troubles and at the worst you are blind. I highly recommendgetting eye protection. Any sporting goods store will have these, as well asworkplace safety stores. Some of the tactical eye protectors are expensive.There are companies that make tactical eye protection, and these are easilyfound on the Internet.Knee and Elbow PadsIf you are one of the unlucky ones who, for whatever reason, has to stay in anurban environment and do what you may have to do in a survival situation, kneeand elbow pads will become your best friend. I had to get a new knee because Iwas not wearing knee pads when I should have been. After the disaster, I am surethere will be no more knee surgeries as important items run out, such aspainkillers. Any sporting goods store or military surplus store will have whatyou need.Extendable BatonMost police officers carry these devices on duty. For the situations we aretalking about in this book, they would be excellent for every group member tohave. They are an impact weapon that can be used when assisting another groupmember, when you do not have to use a bullet, or it’s all you have whenattacked. They can be carried on a belt anytime you are awake and moving, andonce pulled, a flick of the wrist gives you a defensive baton. Like all otherweapons, batons take training and practice. If you purchase a baton, be sure toinclude a carrying sheath.OC SprayOC is commonly called pepper spray and is used by both police and civilians forself-defense. The younger group members who may not be effective in a physicalconfrontation can incapacitate even the biggest looter or raider with OC. It issold over the counter in many states. Like any other weapon, you need to gettraining and then practice. OC can be carried in your pocket or a carrier onyour belt. I have used it many times in my career, and it has worked on everyoneI used it on except one individual, who appeared to be immune. I have heard manystories over the years of others it did not work on, but I still consider it oneof the best nonlethal defensive weapons.Hatchet or TomahawkThese are great defensive or offensive weapons that deliver devastating woundsand kinetic energy. Carried on either a belt or combat harness, they give thegroup member another option besides using ammunition. Like knives, they shouldnot be brought to a gunfight, but there is a place for them in critical events.Like all other weapons, they take training and practice. Tomahawks are weaponsand should not be used as a hatchet. You will find them in most sporting goodsstores.Bows: Recurve, Compound, and CrossbowBows and arrows have been around thousands of years and are still used today,but they are better than ever. For Surviving While Surviving, they are theultimate silent hunter. You can take down an elk with a hunting arrow, and youcan use them for self-defense. All sporting goods stores have these greatdevices. If you purchase a bow, be sure to get practice arrows along withhunting arrows, as a bow requires practice. Keep in mind that whether you have astandard bow or a crossbow, you will need a quiver to carry extra arrows.Learning to make your own bow and arrows is also a good skill to have in asurvival situation.Personal Medical KitEveryone should have a personal medical kit with dressings for wounds,tourniquets, clotting bandages, etc. The initial first aid for trauma wounds isimportant and generally lifesaving. The group should have a large medical kitwith surgical implements and trained personnel to use it. Unfortunately, in thesituation we are talking about, serious injuries requiring surgery will in mostcases result in death. If there is a group member with any medical knowledge, heor she should continue advanced medical training until disaster strikes. Groupmembers with medical training should also be the ones to procure the group’smedical equipment.This covers my recommendations for a group of people who may or may not knowmuch about this equipment. There are numerous manufacturers for each item onthis list, so I suggest you do some online research prior to making anypurchases. Do your research as if your life depends on it!I know those who are prepared and working on their survival equipment or aresoldiers, police, or outdoorsmen will ask why I went to the trouble to explainwhat everybody knows. Those from our community know this information, but thereare countless millions out there that do not have a clue. In the group thatknows nothing about this equipment, I am sure many will say, “Crap, this isgoing to be a long haul—almost impossible.” My answer to them is goodthinking—you are right. If you’re in the group that feels you need to startpreparing for a major disaster, go back and read the introduction to this bookand get to work.If you are living in a rural or urban setting, reread the appropriate chapterand take the lists in this book and get to work. I cannot help you; only you andyour group can do that. The best anyone can tell you is that disaster isprobably going to strike between now and the end of your life. You either haveto roll the dice and hope it does not happen, or if you know you do not gamblewell, get busy and start preparing. Look at your family or yourself in themirror and ask what you are going to do if people start breaking into your houseto get what is in your pantry. After that self-analysis, look in your pantry andask yourself if you are ready for disaster.This chapter is on individual protective gear. If each individual in the grouphas this gear, then you have also got group protective gear. Depending on thesize of the group, you should be able to defend the survival location and anygathering party that goes outside the survival location looking for food, water,and needed equipment. This does not mean you will not experience casualties thatwill weaken the group over time. Keep in mind that you are probably awell-trained and equipped group among many prowling the area.Our country is no different than any other modern country in that we dependalmost daily—and sometimes several times daily—on a supply of food and criticalitems being delivered to us. For those of you who have no idea what happens on adaily basis, spend some time on a street where there is a pharmacy or majorgrocery store and count how many Fed-Ex, UPS, and eighteen-wheel trucks unloadpackages at the loading docks. If you live in an area where the next hurricaneor major weather event is predicted, look at how fast shelves in these storesare depleted. We live in a fragile society, and panic, quickly followed byviolence, will happen if things go bad. The longer they go bad, the worse itwill get. Yes, stores will be the first to be looted, and that will happenquickly. Houses will be next.What you read in these pages is to get you to think. Some will start what shouldbe lifelong work to prepare to survive a disaster—or at least raise the chancesconsiderably of surviving. However, it will all be for nothing without themental fortitude to do what you may have to do. Keep in mind that what we havelearned in the warrior community in this country, and indeed the world, sincethe beginning of human combat is that good intentions do not make mentalfortitude. Neither do they get you ready for diversity and combat. What gets youready is disciplined training where you sweat, sometimes bleed, and hurt to yourheart while still heading where you have to go to successfully complete thetask. Can I tell you that you can do it an easier way or that equipment is moreimportant than people with the right mental attitude? The answer is NO. Get towork!Now let’s talk about personal gear and how you use it. Warriors, commandos, andguys with the equipment already, this is not for you. I will start out simple soyou understand the hows and whys of why we have to do what we do.• Survival is a full-time everyday job.• Tactical living is a full-time everyday job.• You are going to have to Survive While Surviving every day.In this chapter, I have provided a list of an enormous amount of equipment toensure your survival or that of your family or group. Are you going to carry allof it everywhere you go? Of course not. If you could, you would probably notneed any gear at all.Let’s review the weapons I recommended: rifles or long guns, hunting rifles, M4sor assault rifles, and combat pistols. Because of their short range, shotgunsare not rifles, but we will include them here. It’s important that you know howto use the different guns that you should have available as a member of thesurvival location guards or the gathering party. As in everything we do withguns, you must pay strict attention to ammunition management. Do not just shootto feel good or scare people; that’s ammunition you will need later to savelives and protect the group. Good training will teach this.Defending the Survival LocationIf you need to defend the survival location, depending on approaches into thesite and where you perceive that you need to defend yourself, there may beranges from across the room to several hundred yards involved in yourself-defense and that of the survival location. Your choices would be the M4 orhunting rifle with scope, shotgun, and pistol. Where would you use each ofthese? When observing out of windows, use the hunting rifle first because of itsrange and accuracy. Use the M4 if you do not have a hunting rifle. Do not wasteammunition once a looter is down; do not shoot again unless he or she becomes athreat.Use shotguns and pistols for any close-range shooting inside the survivallocation or in close proximity to doors and windows. Shotguns are excellent forengaging looters coming through doors or windows. If fighting inside thesurvival location and you run out of ammunition in your rifle or shotgun,transition to your pistol. Practice this in training.image [../Images/128-1.jpg]It’s important that you know how to use the different guns that you should haveavailable in a survival situation. (Dale C. Spartas/http://www.spartasphoto.com[http://www.spartasphoto.com])As discussed above, batons, OC, and hatchets are good defensive weapons. Whileguarding the survival location, having a utility belt on with these items wouldbe a good idea. If you decide you have to go outside the survival location, puton your combat harness with its extra magazines and equipment. If you do notknow what you are going to be facing, be as prepared as possible when leavingthe survival location.The defense of the survival location, especially in the early days of surviving,will be critical. If you have well-stocked shelves and rooms, the last thing youwill want to do is lose them. In the early days when you are well stocked, therewill not be as much of a need for gathering parties as there will be once timegoes by. You should start rationing as soon as disaster hits. If it all goeswell, things may be straightened out in a month or so, but do not count on it.Even with well-stocked shelves, if you can fish or hunt, do so. Smoke the meatand fish to preserve it and add to your stock.When defending the survival location, your personal protective gear does not allhave to be worn. The survival location should be prepared so extra ammunitionand defensive gear is in the places that will support the defense. For instance,if you have fortified the corners, a shotgun with extra ammunition should bethere. Anything for reloading or defense of the location should be in place.Rucksacks and any other gear that defenders would want to take with them in theevent that they would have to leave the location quickly should be located whereeach member can pick it up, put it on, and go do what they have to do.image [../Images/129-1.jpg]Keep rucksacks handy in case there’s a need to leave the location quickly.(warrengoldswain, courtesy of iStock)If you think I have a hang-up on guns, in the situations we are talking about, Ido. It’s going to get rough if disaster strikes. I know preppers who have manytimes more guns and ammunition than I have recommended here. This chapter is forthe ones who are just starting to prepare and for the ones who are preparing andmay not have thought about what it’s really going to take to Survive WhileSurviving.Defending the Gathering PartyWhen out with the gathering party, the chance of being fired on from aclose-range location is good. There will be as many or more times that you willhave to shoot at longer ranges. The gathering party should have a mix of huntingrifles and M4s or similar weapons, and everyone should have a pistol. These arethe primary weapons I would recommend for travel outside the survival location.If the intent of the gathering party is hunting small game, certain partymembers should have pellet guns and .22s as secondary weapons. Never get into agunfight with a pellet gun! If going after big game, bows and arrows should becarried for silent hunting. Everyone should be in their combat harness,rucksack, body armor, helmet, knee and elbow pads, and eye protection,especially in an urban environment. Rucksacks should have a medical kit, extraammunition, water, and whatever else members think they will need. To theuntrained, you will find the daily grind of carrying needed gear tiring and evenpainful at times, but you will be doing what every combat soldier has done sincethere were armies and wars.If it’s winter, extra warm clothes should be carried by all if there is a chancethat the party will be out overnight. Half the party should carry sleeping bags.The reason only half carry sleeping bags is that in bad areas half should be onguard while half of the party sleeps. This can be modified if the group is in agood defendable location. Forgetting your tactical responsibilities will sooneror later get you killed. If using vehicles, there should be a minimum of two ina perfect world. If having to use pushcarts, no more than half the gatheringparty should have them, as the other half are on movement security. Theseactions are taken if there is a complete breakdown of society and looter andraider groups are out looking for an opportunity to score a successful raid. Astime goes by, this would be a constant threat, especially in an urbanenvironment.What Could Possibly Go Wrong?• The defenders of the survival location may be driven out of the locationwhile the entire group is in it.• The defenders may be driven out while gathering parties are gone.• The gathering party may be ambushed and not return.• The gathering party may be trapped by looters and cannot return.• The gathering party returns with casualties and no food or water.• One of the gathering parties returns and reports the other gathering partyis trapped by looters at a known location.I think these six bullet points cover enough to get people thinking. Whatstarted as a normal day can quickly turn into a disaster that will have a severeimpact on the group no matter what its size is. Let’s take them one at a time.Basic Decisions That Will Have to Be Made• If the group is driven out of the survival location, it will mean eitherthey were forced out or decided to leave because of circumstances. If forcedout, they are probably under attack and are going to have to make a tacticalevacuation—possibly under fire. This would tax a well-trained military unit. Ata group level, this should have been planned and rehearsed. Compounding theevacuation, there may be group casualties. This is where group size matters—toosmall and you are probably dead. A large group could evacuate wounded and headto the rally point while covered by the rest of the group. If the survivallocation is surrounded by a large group of looters, a breakout is going to becostly. In this instance surrender is not an option. No good news here.• If driven out while gathering parties are gone, all protocols in the firstscenario are in play, plus the group is now split. If there are nocommunications possible with the gathering party, there should be a plan to meetat the rally point. This plan would prevent the gathering party from returningto the survival location and being ambushed by the group that forced theevacuation. All gathering parties should return to the survival location by wayof the rally point, especially if there is no communication available betweenthe survival location and the gathering party. This is a good tactic, and youwill see reference to this in other parts of this book. With no electroniccommunication available, the group will have to do everything by planning or usecouriers, which is anything but ideal but is how things have been done incritical situations for thousands of years.- A good technique here is that by SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures), whenreturning to the survival location, all gathering party routes go through aplanned area out of sight of the survival location and rally point. This area iswhere the part of the group that had to evacuate the site would leave aprearranged signal for the gathering party to go to the rally point. This iseasily done in urban areas and can work in rural areas. This is basic groupprotection. No one should have to live under these conditions, but if along-term survival situation presents itself, plans and actions such as thiswill be forced on groups if they want to Survive While Surviving.• If the gathering party is ambushed, several possible results could happen,and all would put the group into disarray. Without communication, the part ofthe group securing the survival location would not know what washappening—except that the gathering party did not return. Everyone in the partycould have been killed. All or part of the party may have escaped and are goingto the rally point. This should be planned if anyone is ambushed. This preventsthe ambushers from following the survivors back to the survival location.• The gathering party could be forced to move in a direction away from thesurvival location and the location of some members might be unknown. The groupsecuring the survival location would have some serious decisions to make. Onewould be to send members to check the designated rally point. One might be to golook for the gathering party, and one may be to wait and see what happens. Thiswould depend on available food and water. No positive answers here—the group mayhave issues in the long run that they won’t have the ability to fix.• If the gathering party gets trapped and cannot return, the survival locationgroup will not know anything unless they have communication. All thepossibilities discussed in the previous situations would be in play. Thedifference here would be that the gathering party may be alive and holding upwell but are trapped due to their error or terrain—it makes no difference. Youcan plainly see without communication, dire decisions will have to be made. Onlyhistory will record how they come out.• If the gathering party has run into trouble and comes straight back to thesurvival location with casualties, they are probably being hard-pressed if theycould not get to the rally point. At this point, the survival location partyassists the gathering party and does what they have to do to stop the looters.Casualties will also have to be attended to. If the gathering party returnedwithout food and water, the fate of the group may or may not hang in thebalance. The decision on what the group has to do next will hinge on thelooters’ ability to lay siege to the survival site and how much food and wateris on hand to feed the group. There are no good answers here. Maybe the groupwins, but maybe they don’t.• If one of the gathering party returns with news that looters have trappedthe gathering party at a known location, this will probably be the easiestdecision. The group, for what it is worth, has valid communication and knows atleast what the situation was when the group member left the gathering party. Tohelp the gathering party, a quick plan is needed, but we need to know a fewthings.- How far away is the gathering party? If they are a few blocks away, thesurvival location group needs to start the fight with the necessary weapons.- If they are two days’ travel out, they need to take all their protectivegear and extra ammunition. They also need to know what shape the group was inwhen last seen, how many casualties there were, and their ammunition and waterstatus. Did they have a plan to break out if they could, and what route werethey going to use to get to the rally point? If the group broke out, the plannedroute to the rally point should be the route the rescue group follows. These arehard tactical decisions that must be made quickly by group leaders.- What group members will be left to guard the survival location, or is itworth taking everyone and either hoping for the best or moving to a newlocation? This depends on how much critical equipment is in the survivallocation that cannot be transported. If the group going to rescue the gatheringparty will be gone several days, that would certainly put the group left at thesurvival location in a serious situation unless the group was a big one. Whethertraveling or in the survival location, there should always be a close designatedrally point known by all members in case the group is separated bycircumstances.I hope the discussion on these bullet points drives home the importance ofprotective gear and the need for firearms and ammunition. If vehicles areavailable, this is a much easier situation for the group to handle. I am toldthat civilians with no training would not be able to handle a situation like weare discussing. I agree to a point, but dire situations sometimes bring naturalleadership to the front and untested individuals can save the day.If disaster struck today, I think only groups that were trained and had someexperienced people would make good decisions here. Any untrained group wouldprobably be paralyzed by indecision, but the exception would be my comment onnatural leadership as a possibility. There is still time to prepare and get sometraining, but the ones who do train and start preparing may still fail and belost to history. Trained and prepared groups are at the mercy of fate and luckand may still perish. If you are a student of history, you know that in the pastentire civilizations have perished or disappeared. This would certainly bepossible in a worldwide disaster and could happen in a national disaster underthe right circumstances.This book is designed to open up thought processes and enhance training time;all situations presented here could easily be trained on intensely in apaintball or range environment. I suggest choreographed walk-through trainingfirst, then paintball, and then range. I also hope that some semblance of ordercontinues to exist after disaster and groups caught up in violent situationscould depend on help coming from other responsible people in whatever is left ofsociety. However, experience based on history tells me that if the lights go outnationally and stay out for a year or more, things are going to get rough allthe way around.I would like to leave the uninitiated who are reading this book some thoughts onindividual protective equipment. No matter what you have, it is your lifeline toSurviving While Surviving. Following are some points that have been driven homemany times over in my career by trainers and soldiers with vastly moreexperience than I.• Keep your weapons on you or at arm’s reach.• Clean and maintain your weapons religiously, including magazines.• Do not use corroded or dirty ammunition.• When taking equipment out of your rucksack or backpack, put it back in assoon as you are finished.• All guns are always loaded—treat them as such.• If you take off any gear, have it so you can get it quickly. Never have itscattered or in disarray.• Whatever gear you put on your combat harness or utility belt should notinterfere with other gear that may have to be used quickly.• If you are carrying gear you are not using, why are you carrying it?• All equipment gets heavy when you’re tired, but equipment should becomfortable when you are not tired.• If in a bad area, sleep with your boots on. Never sleep without someone onguard.• If you have well-trained small units, you automatically have well-trainedlarge units.• The people that sweat and bleed in training will bleed less in combat.image [../Images/134-1.jpg]Never sleep without someone on guard. (mediaphotos, courtesy of iStock)If you pay attention to these bullet points, you will be heading in the rightdirection. I had always heard that if things are going to go wrong in a tacticalsituation, they will go wrong at the worst possible time. I have found this tobe true on numerous occasions. No one can predict what our future holds, but weare at a time in our history where things are taking place that could not havebeen imagined fifty years ago.We now have sheriffs and police chiefs on national television telling thecitizens in their cities and counties to arm themselves and be ready to protectthemselves. This is being said in a time before disaster, so I do not even wantto think what will happen to the unprepared after disaster. It is human naturethat necessary things we do not like or look on as difficult are sometimes putoff or studiously ignored. What we are talking about in this book—the need toprepare—is one of those tasks. Depending on where you live, you are facing suredisaster in the future. I am not a weatherman or prophet, but I would suggestthat another storm along the lines of Katrina or Sandy is in the future. I wouldalso say that having prepared for disaster does not mean your stores will notend up downwind or underwater if you do not evacuate when ordered. Having yoursurvival gear packed in vehicles makes evacuation easy and safer for all. I alsoknow that this may not be possible for one-vehicle families or familiesdepending on public transportation, but again I have no good answers."},{"pageContent":"Chapter SevenGroup Survival EquipmentIn the last chapter, I covered my take on individual protective equipment. Ihave mixed feelings on what I am going to say next because of the different wayspeople look at things. There will be a group that will say the most importantthing in a survival situation is food and water, and they would be right—all thesurvival books say so. The survival books also say fire and shelter are veryimportant, and they are right.My take on the national disaster we are talking about in this book is that gunsand ammunition are the most important. I say this because when a breakdown ofsociety happens, if you do not have guns and ammunition, it makes no differencehow much food and water you have. Eventually someone else will be eating anddrinking it if you do not have the means to stop them from taking it.You can starve to death while having all the guns and ammunition you need. Butin the situation we are talking about, I will go with guns and ammunitionbecause with them I can always get food and water. Let’s leave that right there.I have presented information to evoke some serious thinking on group andindividual protective gear and individual equipment to Survive While Surviving.It’s time to think of the long haul—we are going to prepare for a year ofsurvival in our planned survival location. If you are planning a move to aremote location, take a look at group vehicles and what they are going to carry.Some changes may be made in the preparatory phase, which is hopefully takingplace now. What is the group going to need to make it a year? In urban areas,where are you going to cache survival gear? If it all goes to pieces, can youstock enough to keep you and the group going? We’re going to start out with thereally serious stuff: food and water.FoodI am told that to stay healthy you should be taking in at least one thousand totwelve hundred calories a day. This means in the preparatory phase, we reallyneed to consider what we store for food. Being from a military background, Iwould immediately think of MREs (Meals Ready to Eat). They are heavy on caloriesand sustain combat troops in the field. They also have a five-year shelf life,so if you’re decent at math and know you are stocking up for a year, you shouldbe okay. I have seen people buy MREs and when they got to their home, the mealswere already past their shelf-life date. I have eaten MREs past their shelflife, and in my experience they haven't killed me. However, I am an oldsoldier—I like C rations. There are better foods that will last longer and arebetter for you, including the following food types.Freeze-Dried FoodsJust add boiling water and let simmer. Some out there have a twenty-five-yearshelf life, and they taste good. They come in easily stackable military-gradepackaging and will give you some of the calories you need. I’m told some arebetter than others. I suggest trying a few out and make your own decisions. Howmany will you need? I say two per day per group member, so do the mathematics.If you are going to move them, make sure you have the cargo space or storagespace in your survival location. I am still researching these, but they lookpromising from a survival standpoint.image [../Images/138-1.jpg]Some people will say the most important thing in a survival situation is foodand water, and they would be right. The survival books also say fire and shelterare very important, and they are also right. (Dale C.Spartas/http://www.spartasphoto.com [http://www.spartasphoto.com])Dried BeansThere are several different dried beans that will fit your survival needs.Historically, beans have been keeping people alive for thousands of years. Theyare certainly much cheaper than freeze-dried foods. They must be kept dry whenstored but will last as long as you need them. Pinto, red, and lima beans are mypersonal favorites. There are people who do not like beans or may have allergiesto them, and I understand that. If you don’t have allergies to a particular beanbut just don’t like them, I will tell you that if disaster strikes and goes longterm, you will gladly eat them. Rice and beans are both nutritious yetinexpensive foods that, when combined, form a complete protein and contain somesodium. Additional information can be readily found online. I say storeeverything in metal containers, as once disaster strikes mice and rats willbecome a major problem. Metal containers will keep them from getting into yourfood stores.RiceWhite rice has also been a staple for thousands of years; it’s cheap and can bestored for an indefinite time. I am still researching this. I am told that itshould be stored with oxygen absorbers, but I wonder how people in the old daysmanaged to get by without them. Rice, like beans, must be kept dry or it willspoil. There are now a myriad of watertight containers for food storageavailable, and again I recommend metal containers. Brown rice has oils in itthat will turn rancid over time. People have told me they do not like rice, butI guarantee if they haven’t eaten in five days and someone gives them rice, theywill like it. Another plus for standard white rice is it contains almost therecommended daily dose of salt (sodium).BuckwheatThis grain-like food is used heavily in Russia and some Asian countries. It ismore nutritious than grain and can be used in a multitude of ways. Americaproduces around seventy-plus tons a year. It stores for the long term and has ashort growing season. Most Americans know little to nothing about buckwheat, butI think it’s worth the time to research and give it a try.These are not the only foods you will want or need, but they are, with theexception of freeze-dried foods, centuries-old staples that have savedpopulations from certain extinction. In an urban environment—because of rats,which are in abundance—all foods should be stored in metal containers on palletsto ensure that it does not spoil and to keep vermin from gnawing through to eatit. Now let’s talk a little about the trouble you could have on a move to yourremote location. The food needs to be stored in an airtight container in a dryenvironment. If you are ambushed or your vehicles get shot up en route to yoursurvival site, a detailed check of all storage containers needs to be made toensure there are no breaks or bullet holes in them that will let your food gobad or be invaded by vermin. You are never going to have enough food stored in asurvival situation, so you do not want part of what you have to spoil becauseyou did not check.WaterThis is an absolute no-brainer whether you are in an urban or rural setting.Water means you may live if other things go right, but without it you are goingto die. I have mentioned before the ways to ensure you have water. If buyingland in a rural area, make sure there is a water source on it. Also, in yourmove or stored at your site, you need to have plastic sheets or tarps and asmany barrels as you can get with sealed tops for collecting rainwater. If youare in an urban area, if you have a flat roof this should be a garden andrainwater gathering area. If you have a yard, the same thing should be takingplace. After some time in a survival situation, things are going to get bad, andyou are going to have to guard your water or someone else will be drinking it.If you are moving to a rural site and it has water on it, you can reduce theweight you have to transport and gain space on vehicles by not transporting tonsof water. If your water collection barrels have removable tops, you can storeequipment in them for the move to make more room. If you are ambushed or shot upon the move, check all containers to ensure they are functional. If transportingwater, the check should be easy—if water is leaking out of the truck bed, yourcontainers have been hit. When making the move, all canteens or hydro-packsshould be full, and a full five-gallon can or two should be on each vehicle.If you just eat rice and beans and have water to drink, you will live a longtime. Some doctor or scientist may prove me wrong, but if it comes to it, I willchance it. Living where I do, supplementing them with meat will not be aproblem. Let’s talk about something most people do not think of when it comes topreparing for survival. In short-term survival it makes no difference, but inthe long term, it’s the difference between maintaining some health and maybestaying alive.SaltFew people think of salt when thinking of survival, and in a short-termsituation it doesn’t make a difference. In the long term, salt, or sodium,becomes a two-edged sword. If you are not getting enough, you could die.However, if you’re getting too much, you could get sick and maybe die. If youare salt deficient, you have a condition known as hyponatremia, and you are introuble. When your salt levels are good, all vital body functions are working,such as proper blood volume and your electrolytes functioning properly. If saltlevels are low, seizures and coma are possible. I suggest having a good supplyof salt on hand, and use it like you do now. Mineral streams may be a source, asthey also contain various levels of sodium. I am told the daily dose of saltshould be a level teaspoon, which is approximately 1200 mg.IodineIodine is an element that is needed for the production of thyroid hormones. Thebody does not make iodine, but it is an essential part of your diet. Iodine isfound in various foods that may be difficult to come by in a survival situation.If you do not have enough iodine in your body, you cannot make enough thyroidhormones. Iodine deficiency can lead to enlargement of the thyroid,hypothyroidism, and to mental retardation in infants and children whose motherswere iodine deficient during pregnancy. Make sure iodized salt is on the list ofitems added to your food storage.I put these foods as group survival equipment to drive home the fact that it isan individual and group daily responsibility to acquire and maintain the foodsupply—both by gathering after disaster and preparing nonperishable food storesprior to disaster.I don’t want to be redundant or spend a lot of time telling people how theyshould prepare, but the lists in this book are for readers to think about whatthey may need. This is why we will go over a couple more items on those lists.First, I want to fill in some of the gaps in what you may need for containers totrap rainwater. Trapping water in five-gallon cans makes it easy to carry, butwater barrels will hold more. Even with a water source on your property, thatdoesn’t mean nature will not take it away. If in the city, water will be at apremium once it’s shut off.If you only have five-gallon cans, once they are full, you are done collectingwater. Any rain that happens after that is wasted on the ground. If you alsohave water barrels, you can continue to collect water for drinking, gardening,and barter material, especially in cities. If you are planning on moving fullwater barrels, a good dolly should be in your plans. I suspect water will beworth more than gold in cities. Once you start to barter water, you need to puton your tactical hat, as it will not be lost on anyone that if you have water tobarter, you have a lot more where that came from. Everyone who knows you arebartering water will be looking for your survival location and the water in it.You are most likely going to have to defend it quickly.In the early days of a long-term survival situation when people still have hope,gold and silver will be great barter material. As time goes by and real hungerand thirst are the primary concerns, people will rightfully determine thatneither gold nor silver can be boiled, baked, fried, or eaten. What people willwant to barter is water, food, medicine, fuel, good shoes, clothing, andanything that shoots. Firewood may also be big. I suspect gold and silver willget you either laughed at or run out of town. If you have it, I would suggestusing it early on. Think about it this way: you have not eaten in several daysand someone wants to give you gold or silver for a pair of boots. The questionis, from a survival standpoint, are you still starving or can you eat the gold?I’ve put lists in previous chapters to make you think. There will never beenough equipment, materials, or group capability to cover all thelife-threatening situations that may arise in a long-term survival situation.The lists provided are to give you and the group a measuring stick to determinewhat you can do for yourself and the group in the unending work of acquiringwhat you will need to Survive While Surviving. Once you begin to stock up onfood, water, tools, and all the other things you need to support a lifestylewhile surviving, you will quickly realize, especially in urban areas, that itwill most likely take more room than you currently have. There are going to beseveral ways of looking at this problem, but none of them are really the bestanswer. Depending on the local situation in your area, there may be no answer atall.Let’s start with the one- or two-room apartment in a building with several otherapartments in it. No one- or two-room apartments are going to store all that isneeded. You will look like a hoarder and will not be able to move around, defendthe location, or find specific needed items. It should not be lost on anyonethat it will take all occupants of the building working together to have anychance of success and survival. Good tactical planning must be a part ofeverything you do in preparation for disaster. A good plan would be for allrooms in the building that do not have windows or outside access to be used asstorage rooms. The cellar and attic, if they exist, may also be feasible forstorage. The rest of the building’s rooms would be used for living, lightstorage, work areas, and defense. There needs to be a plan for storage so thingsthat will be needed regularly are easily accessible. Even though the room maybecome very full of what is needed, there needs to be walkways for movement soneeded materials can be easily found. Food, water, and other critical equipmentshould not all be stored in one apartment or location in the building. Note: Allfood and water should be stored in metal containers, as rats will be a problem.We have discussed this before—it is critical to survival when long-term storageis required. Rat poison and a pellet gun should be on hand to deal with thisproblem.All storage should be on the upper floors with the first floor being used forliving, light storage, and defense of the structure. The cellar may also beused, but any street access into the area must be blocked. Should disasterhappen, a lot of construction is going to have to take place for there to be anychance of successfully defending the survival location. The research I have doneleads me to believe that the part of the population who live in these structuresare the most at risk if disaster strikes. The reason is a large percentage ofresidents are day shoppers with little food on hand, and as a group they areunarmed or have just a few weapons and little ammunition. Many live alone withlittle to no support from large families or groups. Added to these problems, thework needed to stock up supplies and prepare the structure for defense is almostimpossible for the occupants of these structures. It can be done, but only bypeople with the right mind-set who are willing to pull together as a group.All is not lost if people pull together and get the process moving. I also hopethat the existing infrastructure of government and local services holdstogether, but only history will record this. I have no idea how much experiencein tactics and planning is available, but expect, as in all population groups inthe country, some exists. Finances will surely be another problem that there areno good answers for. Only time will record how this part of the population faresif disaster strikes. I hope the chapter on urban survival locations and thelists provided give the people who read this book as good a start as possible.After disaster strikes, all that has been discussed here may come to pass.There is no way a single book is going to cover every situation. If your firstthought is that what you want to accomplish is not possible, you have a goodchance of being right. Groups can usually overcome many obstacles that anindividual cannot. I also know that when a group decides to do it and is underpressure of injury or death, amazing things can be done in short order. Havingthe proper survival mind-set will go a long way toward ensuring both individualand group survival.Going along with group equipment, let’s look at another item on our planninglists. Will I have to repair and maintain weapons? Yes.Necessary Equipment• Repair and parts manuals for every gun the group has• Armorer’s tool kit• Spare parts: firing pins, extractors, ejectors, springs, retaining pins,sights, etc.• Cleaning rods, bore brushes, rags, and patches for every caliber the grouphas• Gun oil, powder solvent, lead solvent, gun grease• Personal cleaning kit for each gun• Workbench and storage area for the equipmentIf you have the above in a long-term survival situation, you will be light-yearsahead of almost everyone else. Within the community that I trust and have hadthe privilege to be part of, there are many outlooks on weapons and what is bestfor a group. One view is that all assault rifles should be the same—either M4,AK, etc. This means all weapons the group has have the same spare parts,magazines, and ammunition. I support this view. If you think about it, thisshould be carried out throughout the group’s on-hand weaponry. All combatpistols should be from the same manufacturer and take the same ammunition. Allhunting rifles, .22 weapons, shotguns, bows, and pellet guns should be from thesame manufacturer. This cuts down on the amount of spare parts and cleaning gearand makes it easy to resupply group members who are running out of ammunition ina fight.When starting survival and tactical preparation, I know that funds will be at apremium. This will affect every group and individual that is preparing and notwealthy. Hopefully we have time to do what must be done, but we have no way totell how much time we have. But you may be in better shape than you realize. Ifyou own a gun and it is one not mentioned in this book, you still have what youneed to defend yourself. Start buying ammunition for it and make sure you havecleaning materials and a means to carry it—either a sling or holster. What youcurrently own, you do not have to spend money on to acquire. Learn to use it toits best advantage.Do not bring a pistol to a long-range rifle fight. I have been in discussionswhere the weapon of choice for survival is a .22 rifle and a pistol. This isbecause you can carry a ton of ammunition, as both weapons take the same roundand can be used for hunting and defense. I have no argument with this concept ina survival situation, but I believe from a tactical standpoint this option takesa lot of combat capability away from the group. I repeat, in a long-termsurvival situation, you will be in combat, and you will be engaged by trainedpeople at long range.Let’s look at another question. What can I hunt with to save ammunition?• Bow and arrows• Pellet guns• Spears• Tomahawks or hatchets• Traps and snares• Slingshots• RocksI think you get the idea. These things take practice, patience, time, anddeveloped skill. There are other exotic weapons, such as boomerangs andblowguns, that have been used successfully by tribes around the world. If youhave skills with these, that would be another step toward success and a neededtalent to survive. Do not go out and buy a spear, as one can easily be made withany fixed-blade knife. There are schools and data on how to build traps andsnares and how to use them in any situation—survival or sport. For rocks,tomahawks, and spears, only a good arm, hand-eye coordination, and stealth arerequired to be successful. If planning on using a bow and arrows, extra strings,arrows, and any spare parts should be on hand.I am sure at this time, with the list of items we have covered, you have anunderstanding that one of the things that must be organized, monitored, andadjusted as needed is the storage of your materials. If moving to a rural area,what can go on the vehicles and where? If in a one- or two-room apartmentbuilding, what rooms get what and why? Organization here will save time andfrustration when things start happening. If a solar flare knocks out allelectricity and vehicles, what is the plan if you were planning to move? Therewill be times where you will need to find something in what you have storedquickly, but if it is not organized this will never happen. In the wrongcircumstances, this could be a group disaster requiring emergency actions notplanned for. This almost ensures they will not go well.As in all things of a critical nature, incidents will happen that the group hasnot planned for or are first-time situational circumstances that the group hasno experience in. If this should happen, the stronger the group is, the betterchance they have to react to it. There are no guarantees here. I suspect in thepast, groups exposed to this misfortune decided it was better to move out of thearea, and this may have been the right decision. The problem here is in notknowing what to expect. The group is stuck with having to react to the situationand make a decision as the incident happens. We do things better when we havehad time to think about them—and maybe rehearse them—but I can assure you in adisaster situation that will not always be the norm."},{"pageContent":"Chapter EightMovement and TacticsI do not like discussing tactics, as most professionals consider themselvesexperts. In my view, I am not an expert. If you have not been in every situationpossible, you are not an expert, and very few people have. If you have been, youare only an expert at what you did there. If you are alive, it worked, but Ipersonally shy away from the term. What we are talking about in this book hasnever happened in our history, and if it does, I would be willing to call groupsand individuals who are alive at the end of it experts. With that in mind, Istill do not like discussing tactics but look on it as a necessary evil.With that being said, let’s look at some basics that have worked well in thepast. For you pros and those that are prepared, this is not for you. Allmovement is conducted while using tactics to support it, hence the phrasetactical movement. I am a career soldier, so I will draw heavily from thatexperience and what has worked for me in combat situations. Let’s first startwith group movement, such as what will have to take place with gatheringparties. For the currently untrained, our movement formation will depend onseveral things.Factors Influencing Movement• Enemy capability—looters and raiders• Terrain you have to move through—urban, rural, open, forested, or restricted• Number in moving group and their capabilitiesWith these factors in mind, I will describe some formations that are used by themilitary.• Wedge formation• File formation• Line formationWe are going to stick with these three. They are basic formations used whenmoving, attacking, and moving through restricted terrain. I will explain thebasics to you, and it will be up to you to practice and perfect your group’sknowledge. Keep in mind that when moving outside your survival location, you arein enemy territory. You could be attacked at any time from long or extremelyclose range. One thing to keep in mind is what the formation and eachindividual’s position and dispersion in it are for. This is for all-aroundobservation and security of the formation and ensuring the whole formationcannot be fired on at one time. That’s the plan, but I can tell you if caught ina well-prepared ambush, the whole formation may find itself under fire. Whenmoving tactically, no one moves unless covered by someone else. Review picturesof army wedge formation online, and everything from team, squad, and platoonwill come up. A team is four or five men, a squad is ten men, and a platooncould be as many as forty or fifty.All these formations look good on paper, but in reality every man in theformation should be able to see the man in front of him. The formation shouldnot get so spread out that the line of sight is lost. Once that happens, theunit’s all-around security, observation, and ability to fire is lost. Let’scover formation use and why we have different ones for different situations. Donot forget in your gathering party formations that members may be pushing cartsor carrying heavy loads that prevent them from being ready to defend theformation.Wedge FormationThis formation gives the group the ability to observe and fire 360 degrees. Theentire formation can fire to the front and rear, and half the formation can fireleft and right while staying in the formation. We have used this wedge in openterrain, in woods with good visibility between trees, on city streets, in hillcountry, and in limited visibility. As in all formations, when visibilitydiminishes or terrain closes in, the distance between formation members istightened up. The distance between formation members could be five meters orfewer or out to fifteen or more meters. For survival purposes, any number ofmembers could be in this formation. If there are a large number in theformation, I suggest two or more wedges with as much distance as terrain allowsbetween the wedges. If one wedge runs into looters and has to fire with multiplewedges, one can be firing while the others move. This needs to be practicedbefore the event. Paintball exercises are excellent for this training.File FormationThis formation is used in restricted terrain and during reduced visibility. Theformation members can observe and fire left or right of the formation but havelittle capability to the front and rear. We use this formation in thick woods orbushes, in fog, snow, night, and extremely narrow city streets and alleys. Thedistance between formation members is usually line of sight. This is notconsidered a good combat formation, although maneuvering out of this formationhas been done when fired on by the enemy. In your search engine, type in “armyfile formation” to see pictures. This formation is where breaks in contact arefrequent during reduced visibility. Moving at night through woods almost ensuresbreaks in the formation if tight control is not used. Even then, breaks incontact between members are common.Line FormationThis formation is used as an assault or search tactic. The formation can placeheavy firepower to the front or rear but has little to no combat power left andright. The formation will support fire and movement or fire and maneuver. Inyour search engine, type in “army line formation” or “fire and maneuver.” Thisformation is usually controlled by leaders in the rear of the formation ensuringone part of the formation does not get too far out front or fall behind. As inall formations, the more practice you get, the better you conduct this move.Individual members should not get tunnel vision or target fixation but shouldstay somewhat aware of where they are in the move. Paintball exercises andmovement over varied terrain should be practiced by the group.Fire and MovementIndividual formation members make short rushes forward while supported by othermembers or a section of the line makes a short rush while supported by thenon-rushing section. Varied terrain, short rolling hills, or raises in theground sometimes make this a difficult tactic, as the supporting part of themovement will temporarily lose sight of the moving part, which can result infriendly fire casualties when using live fire, which no one wants or can affordregardless of the situation.Fire and ManeuverA section of the line will maneuver left or right to advance on the enemy flankwhile being supported by the rest of the line. This is a standard infantrytactic that has been used in fields, on hills, in cities, and anywhere theterrain will support the formation’s use. The same disastrous friendly fireaccidents can take place here if the maneuver element location is lost to sightand they reappear in the impact zone of the supporting group members. This hashappened occasionally with well-trained military units.There is also squad or unit overwatch and bounding overwatch tactics. Part ofthe unit will move to a designated point on the ground while covered by theoverwatching part of the unit. The bounding overwatch uses either successive oralternate bounds. This depends on terrain and weapons capability. Review thisonline by searching images of bounding overwatch. Practice these moves withpaintballs. Keep in mind that leaders have to control this formation in asurvival situation just as they do in a military action. If radios are notavailable, this would be extremely difficult and require constant training orrehearsals. Maneuvering out of these formations can be either toward or awayfrom the enemy. I have already cautioned about getting into sustained fights, asammunition will be an issue, as well as casualties and their evacuation underextreme conditions. I suggest ensuring that you have members in the group thatwere in combat arms while in the service, as it would be in the group’s bestinterest. If the moving formation is a gathering party with carts or other meansof hauling equipment and the formation is fired on, the formation engages theenemy while the carts get to safety. If the situation calls for the group tomove forward toward the enemy, the members with carts give what support they canfrom their position and then follow the attack at as safe a distance as would beprudent based on the situation and terrain.Note: No survival group is ever going to be able to use the ammunitionexpenditures the military does. Prolonged engagements will quickly cause anygroup, no matter how well prepared, to run out of ammunition.It is extremely hard to talk in detail, as the formation could get into troublein a wide variety of terrain and obstructed-area situations. There are noperfect answers other than pick good leaders, train, prepare every chance youget, and talk out and rehearse every move. There are other tactical options thatwill and can be used in a long-term survival situation; these are recon andsecurity patrols, ambushes, and raids. My intent here is not to make everyonereading this book into a commando, but basic knowledge on these tactics may bethe difference between living and dying. They will be an important part of yourgroup’s capabilities that will go a long way toward ensuring that you SurviveWhile Surviving. Remember that there will be looter and raider groups that alsoknow these tactics and will employ them against you.Recon PatrolsIn the world of infantry, combat recon patrols are used to find out where theenemy is, what they are doing, and what their capabilities and intentions are.In a long-term survival situation where violence is taking place, nothing aboutrecon patrols should change. You are just using them against a different enemy,which would be looters and raiders. You would also use them to determine if anarea or group of people were safe or a threat. A group conducting recon orsecurity patrols is certainly less likely to be surprised by looters or raiders.The bigger the group, the more successful they will be.Requirements to Conduct a Good Recon Patrol• Know where you are going, how you are getting there, and what equipment youwill need. (Have you heard this before?)• Be able to make a good tactical movement.• Be able to move with stealth as a group and an individual.• Be proficient in camouflage.• Be able to observe without being detected.• If detected, be able to make a good, covered withdrawal without gettingdecisively engaged—which is easier said than done in certain situations.A good way to train is with ex-military veterans in a paintball scenario. Findout what it takes to be stealthy in moving on a group and observing them withoutbeing detected. These requirements will change drastically as terrain changes.Also get to know what your personal and physical limits are. Remember you arenot invisible; you must develop the skills to be successful when operatingagainst people who may know as much as you do, if not more. The move frompaintballs to bullets is easy. The difference is engagements with bulletsproduce permanent results.image [../Images/152-1.jpg]In the world of infantry, combat recon patrols are used to find out where theenemy is and what they are doing. (zabelin, courtesy of iStock)Security PatrolsYou would use security patrols around your survival location. These are smallpatrols of a few group members that would go beyond the survival location todetermine if the location was being approached by looters or raiders. They mightset up in a location where they can monitor movement over a wide area. Theyshould be armed and ready to run into looters or raiders. Remember, if outsidethe survival location, carry seventy-two hours of survival and protective gear.Requirements for Conducting a Good Security Patrol• Know where you are going, how you are getting there, and what equipment youneed. (I think you have heard this before.)• Be able to conduct a good tactical small group move in which no one movesunless covered by someone else.• Be able to move with stealth as an individual and small group.• Be able to hide and observe without being detected.• Be able to escape if detected without getting decisively engaged.Security patrols are small with just a few members. The training recon patrolmembers take is the same for security patrols. Both patrols are noncombatoriented, and their intent should be not to make any contact or be detected.This is easier done in a rural area than an urban area. Keep in mind, this is ashort-range area patrol. Also remember the intent of your plan may be overrodeby looter or raider actions.AmbushesMilitary manuals say an ambush is a surprise attack against a moving ortemporarily halted enemy. In our case, that would be looters or raiders.Ambushes can be conducted on roads, trails, city streets, or any place the groupknows looters or raiders would be moving. The ambush should not be detecteduntil the group is ready to fire; camouflage is imperative here. Ambush locationversus terrain is important. Once initiated, the ambush must be conducted withextreme violence and all the firepower the group can deliver. Do not wasteammunition here. You will know fairly quickly if the ambush was successful. Alack of return fire generally means success. The kill zone should be underobservation by all group members. If this is not possible due to terrain, theambush leader should position him- or herself where he or she can see most ifnot all of the kill zone. Again, terrain may prevent this.Requirements for a Successful Ambush• It must remain undetected until initiated.• It must be initiated with maximum accurate firepower.• It must be a complete surprise.• The terrain and its surroundings must support the ambush position.• Security should be in place to secure the ambush site.The ambush should have left, right, and rear security. All members of the ambushshould know the withdrawal route and the designated rally point. In a survivalsituation, all weapons, ammunition, and equipment of those ambushed should betaken by the ambush members. I do not think, as in some military ambushes, thatyou will have to worry about a reaction force of looters or raiders, but leavesecurity in place while taking the weapons and equipment from the kill zone. Donot assume anything. Again, the best way to train is with ex-military combatarms members and paintball exercises. If you cannot do it with paintballs, youcannot do it with bullets.Ambushes have historically been either single-point or area ambushes, whereseveral ambushes are put out on different trails or roads in the same area.Hopefully, radio communication will be available. If not, group leaders musthave control of the group and develop signals to alert the group for neededactions. The ambush should be initiated by gunfire that keys all members to fireinto the kill zone. I am still hopeful that some semblance of order will prevailafter disaster strikes, but based on past world and national history, I am notconfident this will take place.RaidsRaids are probably the oldest tactic in history. People, tribes, and countrieshave been raiding each other since we came out of caves—and I suspect while wewere still in caves. Raids have been used to attack and destroy a certain site,to attack and occupy a site, or to attack a site and take materials that are init. In a long-term survival situation, looters and raiders will conduct a raidwhere and when they find a survival location. Survival groups that are runningout of available food and water will conduct a raid if one of their members or arecon patrol finds an area where there is food and water owned by someone else.That’s the way desperate people act in life-threatening situations.Requirements for a Successful Raid• There must be knowledge of the raid location.• A good tactical plan must be developed.• The raid force must get to the location undetected.• They must have surprise and firepower.Training for raids can be done with paintballs and should be accomplished onvarious terrain and buildings. Groups preparing for disaster can take trainingdays and use half the day for raids or ambushes and the other half for patroltraining. Training should be done in daylight first and then at night. In citiesand large population areas, these tactics would be used the most in a survivalsituation, but groups in rural areas should also be proficient in these tactics.Living life like we do now is easy, but having to survive day to day whiletactically securing yourself would be hard even on professionals. I believeamong the majority of the population, only the ones who have a true survivalmentality and the ability to adapt will be successful. Again, there is no reallygood news here. How will these tactics help the survivalist?They will teach that armed mobs with little dispersion or control of theirfirepower are easily defeated by organized groups. This has taken placethroughout history and continues today in Syria, Iraq, and other areas of theworld. Training is the difference. Another reason survival groups need to learnthese tactics and how to fight as a unit is that they will be facing trained andarmed groups as time passes and things continue to fall apart. These armedgroups may be ex-military members, preppers that have trained for this event,and, as I have already mentioned, drug cartels and street gangs. In the longrun, if the situation lasts months, we are all going to become raiders orlooters.In the cities, these gangs will become a force to be reckoned with by allcitizens whether they are prepared or not. As disaster lengthens and food andwater become harder to get, these gangs will become raiders using their ownrecon patrols to find groups and areas of activity. Sooner or later, everyone isgoing to have to deal with this situation whether they want to or not. Thegroups that are trained the best, armed, and with the right survival mind-setwill do the best against them.As in all events such as those we are discussing, the group being attacked ismost likely going to sustain casualties—both wounded and dead. I am stillhopeful that within the cities there will be places the wounded could betreated, but over time supplies will be depleted. If these places do exist, theywill be forced to practice medicine as they did hundreds of years ago. The mostlikely scenario is that the group will take care of its wounded and hurt to thebest of its ability and will have to watch the critically injured die. I wouldlike to tell everyone that in preparation you could learn surgery, but I cannot.You might be able to learn to suture a wound, take out a tooth, or perform otherminor surgeries, but learning major surgery requires going to medical school. Ifyou are in medical school, you will not have time to do any other preparation,although a group that has a doctor in it should go to great lengths to ensurethat the individual is protected and kept out of firefights as much as possible.In a fight, good tactics would suggest the trained group member does not run outinto gunfire to help casualties but instead casualties are brought to him or herin a secure location. You only have to look at the high percentage of combatmedics and corpsmen who become casualties to know that this is good advice.We have talked about tactics for the gathering party, as they are the ones thatwill be moving through the terrain and have the best chance of ending up in ashooting situation. However, the survival location is another place where thegroup needs to look at some tactics to support their defense of the location. Inthe event that some members have to leave the location, there should be a planto support that move. If the move is to go out and get weapons and equipmentdropped by attackers, group members in the survival location should be in firingpositions and observing for danger before any move outside is made. Groupmembers who are to cover the move should be in two or more positions. If thereis an upper floor, there should be cover positions there. While this ishappening, the other sides of the location should have group members coveringthem. You can see from this requirement why a small group would be ineffective.In a survival situation, the best weapons for covering members would be huntingrifles with scopes. This is because any fire from any member should have anexcellent chance of hitting the target with the first shot. The military usesM4s, squad automatic weapons, and machine guns to supply suppressive fire tosupport a move. In a survival situation, your suppressive fire needs to be yourfirst round hitting and killing what you are shooting at. You will not have theluxury of automatic suppressive fire, but if you do, you should still not bewasting ammunition you will need later. In the military, if I was running out ofammunition in a fight, a radio call would generally get a helicopter andammunition supply fairly quickly. In a survival situation, that is not going tohappen. If you think times were hard when you had ammunition, you are not goingto believe what needs to happen when you run out. You may want to review moviessuch as The Last Samurai, as things are going to get very up close and personal,and you may find yourself violating the cardinal rule of not bringing a knife toa gunfight.When leaving the survival location, you are in danger of being ambushed as soonas the group is outside the location. This, of course, depends on thesurrounding area supporting an ambush position. In time the survival locationwill become well known to anyone in the area, therefore the chance of beingattacked or ambushed while leaving or returning is good. A tactical move out ofthe location is in the group’s best interests. Before departing, binoculars andscopes should be used to determine if an ambush may be present. Any movementshould be suspect, and rifles with scopes should keep it under observation. Thegroup leaving the location should leave with good dispersion between members andbe covered by the rest of the group in the location. I feel this lifestyle ofconstant threats will affect all group members, and they will develop a siegementality where they do not venture from the survival location. This will, ofcourse, result in running out of food and water. Once this siege mentalitystarts to set in, leaders must make a decision on moving to a new location. Thealternative is to start ambushing or raiding those threatening the group.I would like to think that these situations would not arise, but if allgovernment control and police services are gone, I cannot see how they will not.In urban areas, one danger may be if a group of looters or raiders sets up in abuilding that allows them to keep your survival location under observation. Thismakes them a direct and constant threat to the group that will demand unendingoccupation and defense of the survival location or a planned raid on theoffending location. Group leaders will have to make this decision based on thethreat to the group. If the decision is made to try to raid the offending group,several things need to be known. Some can be determined by careful observationwhile others will have to be determined by recon patrols.Before Raiding, Consider These Factors• Is the site fortified?• Does the group possess the ability to clear the fortifications?• How are the occupants armed?• Can the group move on the location without being detected?• Does the group have the capability to conduct the raid?• If not, what would be an alternative plan?Decisions based on these factors may drive the group to decide to move to a newlocation. This decision may be made because the group determines it cannot getthrough the location’s fortifications, it cannot move on the site without beingdetected, or it does not want to risk a major fight that may decimate the group.You can see how the decision on group action or survival will be hard and willresult in the group moving into an unknown and certainly unforeseen future, butthe reality is if we are in a long-term survival situation, we are all in anunforeseen future.Let’s end this chapter with a talk about a move made from the chosen survivallocation. Whether a move for the benefit of the group is from food and waterrunning out at the present location or for tactical reasons makes no difference,we are still going to have to move. First, never go anywhere without a plan, sowhere have we planned to go? Whether it is near or far, we have to look at whatwe have to get to the new location and how we will get there. We’re in troubleif it’s heavy, no vehicles are available, and the new site is a long way away.If it cannot be moved in one load, we have to determine what our options are.Let’s say the move is out of the urban area to a rural site, and the move timeis six days. This puts it at a twelve-day round trip if we have to return to theoriginal location. This is going to drive some serious group decisions based onthe options available and the capability in exercising those options.Some Reasons to Move• The move can be done at the group’s discretion.• The move is forced because of food and water being depleted in the area.• The move is being forced due to an ongoing tactical situation.Let’s take a look at each option, as it will help in the preparation andplanning process. There is a danger of paralysis through analysis when planningand preparing. Hopefully, some information will prevent that.A Move at the Group’s DiscretionThe only decisions that have to be made here are simple. If we cannot transporteverything in one move, how do we handle it?Group Options• Does the group make one move with as much survival gear as possible?• If one move with all survival gear is not possible, is it worthwhilesurvival-wise and tactically to make additional moves?• Can any survival gear left be cached until a trip back can be made?• If not, is it worthwhile to barter it off for needed equipment?• Should equipment left be destroyed if it cannot be taken?• Is any of the equipment so critical that a return trip must be made? Whatgroup members secure it? Is there enough food and water to sustain them whilethe others are gone?As you can see, even with group discretion there are still decisions to be made.If, for instance, an abundance of ammunition was on hand and could not becarried in one trip, this would force additional trips. The question would bewith a twelve-day round trip—if nothing went wrong—could the water and foodsupply sustain the plan? There will always be life or death decisions to be madeif a long-term disaster situation is forced on the population.A Move Because Food and Water Are DepletedThe decisions here are simple—how much food and water is on hand to support themove? If it is not enough for multiple moves, caching what equipment is left maybe an option. If it is not, the group should put what is to be done with theequipment that cannot be transported to a group vote. At any rate, if equipmentmust be left, hard decisions have to be made on what equipment is taken. Keep inmind that if the group gets to the new location, they may not have thecapabilities they did before the move. One might consider that if enoughcritical equipment is being left, it might be better not to move with theunderstanding that gathering parties would have to be gone longer and probablymore often. These will be hard life or death decisions for the group.A Move Due to an Ongoing Tactical SituationIn this instance, the previously discussed points will be in play, but if thegroup is being forced to move because of the tactical situation, they may haveproblems within the group.Potential Problems• They are running out of ammunition.• They do not have the tactical capability to maintain the defense of theirsurvival location.• The group has been reduced in number by casualties and can no longer usegathering parties and defend the survival location at the same time.• They are running out of food and water.Whatever the reason is, a move is imminent, and decisions will have to be madequickly. These decisions will have to focus on what the group is capable ofcarrying while maintaining fighting capability and the ability to evacuate thesurvival location undetected. There are no good answers here. They may escape ifthe looters or raiders attacking the location are not strong enough to fullysurround it, if they can slip away in darkness or inclement weather, or thesurrounding terrain and building configuration may assist their withdrawal.Whatever means they use to withdraw, they are just heading for harder times andwill eventually either perish, become separated, or link up with anothergroup—only history will tell. If disaster strikes, this situation will takeplace many times over.In a true survival situation that goes long term where critical items to supportlife are suddenly not available, there are certain things that will invariablytake place due to the capability of different population groups.Possible Results of a National Disaster• Initially, local governments will try to maintain a semblance of ordersupported by the federal government.• Initially, as it has in the past, looting and violence will break out inmany areas around the country. Local agencies and the federal government willrespond to this violence. Due to the national situation, martial law will bedeclared.• If the power is out nationally, everyone depending on it for life supportwill start to die.• As it always does, violence will beget violence, and looting and riots willspread to cities that initially remained calm.• If you look at the national map, you will quickly realize violence in ourmajor cities will take all the assets the federal and local governments have.• Days into the event, security forces may be shooting looters and rioters butwill also be taking casualties, thereby being less effective. It is a fact thatsecurity forces, both local and government, are vastly outnumbered in all areasof the country.• At a certain point in the battle to restore order in the cities, some localand federal members are going to realize what is happening nationally and desertto go to their families. They will take their weapons and equipment with themand reduce security force effectiveness even more. These desertions may also beon the civilian official side. If you look at hurricane Katrina, many of the NewOrleans police force stayed home to protect their families and homes. This willmost likely also happen in a national disaster.Let’s hold with the bullet points and look at what should be the plan for anycountry, including ours, in a national emergency. When martial law is declared,the first places it will be enforced is in the big cities and metropolitanareas, then the suburban areas, small town America, and finally the rural areas,where we will all hope to be if disaster strikes. There are currently not enoughsecurity forces in any country to enforce martial law if the majority of thepopulation is rioting and taking part in looting and violence.• Days into the event, looters who are tired of getting hammered bystill-effective security forces will start moving into suburban areas. This willspread security forces even thinner. Hopefully neighborhood watch groups willhave thought about this and be ready to put away their cell phones and get theguns out to start dealing with looters and raiders.• At an early point, resupply of security forces will become paramount, andconvoys will be traversing the road system. These convoys will have to beprotected, which will take more security forces out of the fight in the citiesand suburbs.At this point we are at a crossroads—if security forces can restore order, thereis hope we can weather this. If they cannot, a total breakdown of society—atleast in the metropolitan areas—is likely, and the long dark times will begin.At this point everything we have talked about in this book will come to passunless luck or fate steps in.• Initially anyone not armed is in danger of losing their life or beingseriously injured. To be truthful, small families and individuals who are armedare also at risk.• Cities will start to burn, and all supplies will be depleted. Looters andraiders will start attacking each other and move into the suburbs. People whoare alone, disabled, or sick will start to die.• People in small towns and living in rural areas will pull together, andlocal governments may establish some order. Hopefully a militia will beestablished to assist the local police and fire departments. Local farmers willpitch in, and some semblance of a food supply, water, and maybe electricity willbe available.• In cities, if gas is in vehicles and they are working, some industriouslooters will try to get as far as they can to continue looting. At this timeeveryone should be on guard and hopefully armed. Survival is going to be a wayof life and so will Surviving While Surviving.After reading these bullet points, you might think certain groups may start thissurvival situation better off than others as far as armament goes. That thoughtwill be correct and will instantly start to affect everyone in the area.For instance, what equipment did the deserters take with them? Heavy weaponryand armored vehicles would be one guess. What are the ex-security forces goingto do when they get hungry? What are looters and raiders now armed with sincethey have looted gun stores and possibly supply convoys that were hijacked? Froma tactical standpoint—and even if you have prepared and have the weapon mixsuggested in this book—you may not be the best armed group in the area. I willsay armament is good, but it is only as effective as the user’s ability andtraining to use it.I am not going to dwell on what caused the national disaster. Whether it was apower grid failure, a financial collapse, or a solar flare that knockseverything out makes no difference if what I have depicted in this book happens.At the end of the good times, if you have not prepared as a nation, state,county or city, or as a group or individual, the game will be on. All of us willbe in the same situation, and you will live or die depending on yourpreparedness, luck, adaptability, and mind-set, but there will be no guarantees.If disaster lasts a year or more, I have no idea what the end result will be. Westarted in caves, and those of us who are still alive may be back in them.With that being said, there are certain possibilities if the disaster is only inthe United States or North America. These things are certainly worth thinkingabout regarding what is going to take place with the rest of the world.Several Possibilities Come to Mind• A worldwide rescue event is initiated.• An unfriendly country sees a chance to launch nuclear missiles.• An unfriendly country decides to invade during this time of crisis.I will leave it at those three. I can only imagine in the first case responsewill be slow, incomplete, and uncoordinated, which will cause delays and theinitiation of some of the situations we have talked about. In the second case,we as a nation will be finished, and survival options just got fewer. In thethird, we have all of the problems discussed in this book plus an ultimate armedgang will be looking to kill us or subjugate us. If a national disaster strikesbased on what is currently happening in our world, I guess all of the abovethree situations could be put down as distinct possibilities."},{"pageContent":"Chapter NineCachesWe have mentioned caches in a couple chapters in this book. I consider cachespart of your tactical survival plan. The first question to come up is where do Icache something I will need later? Back when there were fewer people this wasfairly easy. Today, with what seems like people being everywhere you go, onceyou decide on your cache site, the first question should be if anybody islooking and how you should hide it.Generally, in rural areas it is pretty easy to determine if you are truly alone.In urban areas, with buildings every square inch and thousands of windowssomeone could be in with binoculars, it is almost impossible to guarantee youare not being observed if you are out on the street. Let’s look at sometechniques that have worked in the past. We will start with the biggestpopulation areas first.Caching in an Urban AreaCaching in any urban area is difficult in the respect that it is generallycovered in concrete. On the other hand, there are thousands of buildings, vacantlots, yards, and parks that could be used. If your survival location is in anurban area, you may be able to cache close to or at your survival location. Froma tactical standpoint, this would possibly be your best option. However, thethought of most looters would be that everything is in the structure, and nothought of an outside cache would even enter their minds. Let’s look atbuildings in the heart of the city. The first rule of caching is to rememberwhere you put it.Places to Consider• Wooden stairs—If you pry up a wooden stair, there is generally a good gapunder the stairs where anything of moderate size could be stored. Therequirement is that nothing should show that the stair was pried up, and itshould be secured so it is as stable and tight as the other stairs. There isalso a chance the wood may be pried up for fuel if it is a hard winter, and yourcache could be discovered.• Air conditioning and heating ducts—These have been used all over the worldfor hiding contraband and family treasures. The attic or cellar would be thebest places to cache anything. In upper rooms would also be good if a duct witha grate was present. If the duct is a vertical duct, the cache material could behung down into it with a rope or cord. The cord needs to be securely held by ascrewed in eyebolt or equivalent, and some trash or other camouflage materialneeds to be used to conceal the cord.• Boilers—Many older buildings have large boilers for heating the building.Most have access doors into a fairly large space that would be ideal for acache. With the power out, these boilers would be off. Make sure they areelectrically powered and not coal, as survivors could start a warming fire inthem if they are. You could even put some rubble in and around the boiler tocamouflage the cache. The more it is junked up, the less likely it will belooked at closely.• Buildings with courtyards—Some are concrete, but others are brick,flagstone, or grass. Many have large concrete planters or statues. It should nottake too much thought to be able to cache here. This, of course, is an areawhere you could be under unknown observation. If the building was a group’ssurvival location, being observed by unwanted survivors is not a consideration.The only potential problem here is if raiders run the survival group out of thebuilding and occupy it, getting to the cache may be problematic. Also, the cachemay have to be installed during reduced visibility or inclement weather ifoutside, as it is subject to outsider observation.• Parks and vacant lots—All cities have parks and vacant lots both large andsmall. These are good places to cache if you are not seen by everyone in town.Late at night may be good. In my experience, if you cache by digging it isextremely difficult to camouflage the dig spot. A good place would be under playstations for children. Clear the safety chips, and if it is not concrete, digand cache, then put the safety chips back and spread some creative rubble andtrash and hope for the best. Do not cache all critical items in one cache site.Vacant lots present many cache potentials, but again you must ask if anyone iswatching. The good thing here is that after the disaster, you will not have toworry about a developer building a structure over your cache.• Commercial buildings—There are numerous places in commercial buildings wherecaches could be positioned. Most commercial buildings are full of machinery,storage materials, small rooms, plumbing pipes, air conditioning vents, etc.There are literally tens of thousands of places where caches could be hidden.Many commercial buildings are full of waste and rubble. If abandoned, thesewould be excellent places for small and maybe large caches, but do not userubble that can be burned for heat. The possibilities in these structures areendless—from old chimneys to hidden ledges and oil or wastewater sumps. Carefulstudy of these areas and imagination will give you some great cache sites.• Single-dwelling survival locations—All of these ideas should be consideredif they exist in or around the structure. If the location is on a slab or youhave a concrete patio, it would be simple to cut out a section of sod, dig underthe slab, and cache what you want. Fill the hole and replace the sod. Any signof caching will soon be erased by nature. You could also put some light rubbleover the site to camouflage it. Another good place is under sheds, doghouses, oranywhere on the property that lends itself to your needs that would look normaland not like an obvious cache site. Again, the cache site should be installed atnight or in the early hours.I am sure this opens some thought on caches, but the old standbys of cuttinginto floors and walls and camouflaging with rubble should not be forgotten. If Iwere putting in a cache, whether it was outside or inside, I would have thegroup do several things before and after caching, but you will have to make yourown decisions and then roll the dice that they were good ones.image [../Images/166-1.jpg]Commercial buildings are often full of waste and rubble. (Lorraine Boogich)When Caching• I would do several walk-throughs to assess the site to determine it is whatI need.• Once chosen, I would put the site under twenty-four-hour covert surveillanceto see what traffic comes through the area.• I would wait for a dark or inclement night to install and camouflage thesite.• I would do a walk-through the next day to check the camouflage and have thesite under twenty-four-hour covert tactical surveillance.If the cache was detected going in, it would be dug up immediately by whoeversaw the team install it. The surveillance team would be a tactical team thatcould deal with anyone attempting to dig up or steal the hidden goods toretrieve them for their group’s benefit. Some people will say this is paranoid,but I say it is a good, smart tactic in a Survive While Surviving situation.Groups who think this way have a better than average chance of still being aliveif the disaster situation ends and normal times return. For example, if yourcache of interest has ammunition in it and you are in a fight with looters andare running out of ammunition, the cache is your resupply that will keep youalive. If you get to the cache where you put it and find your ammunition isgone—stolen by someone who observed you putting it in—would these tips have beenparanoia or good tactics?In my world, everything that is cached is in either square or round PVC pipewith end caps and a desiccant bag for absorbing moisture inside. If buriedoutside, the seal lines on the end caps are sprayed with water seal or bed linerto ensure there is no water leakage into the container. All food is doublewrapped and left in its original bags before being placed into the PVC pipe andburied. There are other ways to seal a cache that are easily found on theInternet. I use PVC pipe for its durability, and I can determine the length andshape I need.Caching in a Rural AreaThis should be a safer drill than caching in an urban area, but I would notthrow away good tactics here. I would still do my walk-through, observe the sitefor a day, put it in at night, check the camouflage the next day, and have itunder tactical surveillance for a day after the cache was put in. The placesavailable in rural areas are in the millions over several hundred acres.Where to Cache in Rural Areas• In and around the survival location• In burned-out buildings• In dry streambeds• Underwater in lakes, ponds, and streams• Between large boulders in boulder fields• In hollow trees• In dense growths of bushes• Under existing trails or roads• Under prominent trees on steep slopes• In swamps or high-water areasAgain, all my caches are in PVC pipe. I usually use square for ammunition infactory boxes, round for weapons and other equipment, and both square and roundfor food and other needed survival items. Things that are cached underwater arealways attached to a hidden pull cord, the PVC has two desiccant bags in it, andthe entire PVC package is sprayed with two coats of leak seal. I have not sunkfood in water, but I tend to bury it in areas of good drainage and away fromareas subject to erosion. There are no guarantees when caching that MotherNature will not take your cache away. Stay away from avalanche and rock slideareas. Bad flooding during heavy rain years could take your underwater cacheaway. In dry streambeds, I tend to bury them deep.Total knowledge of your cache sites is imperative; you should be able to findthem in the dark. You should also have them recorded as waypoints on your GPS,though those devices may not be around in a long-term survival situation whenbatteries run out. I tend to put the cache in at night. If you are putting onein during the day, you should be masked from long-range observation. If you areputting in your cache and one ridgeline over someone is watching withbinoculars, unless you are following the recommended tactical principles youwill lose your cache. As in urban areas, I believe the cache will be approachedand dug up immediately once the observers think you are out of the area.You will always find great places to cache; the hard part will be picking goodplaces you can cache without being seen. This is much harder in urban areas, ofcourse. Caching requires a smart, tactical mind, especially in a survivalsituation where people will be looking at and salvaging anything they think canbe of use for their survival or barter material. Periodically, check on yourcaches while hunting, wood or water gathering, or security patrolling. There isno need to approach the cache site any closer than you need to make sure thesite has not been found. Good tactical principles and a little luck will ensureyour caches stay safe from prying eyes and others who would look on stealing acache as good luck in their survival efforts. When burying weapons andammunition, beware of metal detectors. Do a double cache—dig a deep hole foryour weapons or ammunition and have at least a foot or more of dirt, then have acache of tools or nails, bolts, etc. Hopefully anyone using a metal detectorwill not check further after finding the tools. In tests this has been the caseevery time.When preparing, a little practice caching will go a long way in making yousuccessful if disaster strikes. I am not saying that bad luck will not get yourcaches found—that is always a possibility. Caching, as is everything else in asurvival environment, is not a guarantee you will be successful. There is alwaysan enhanced chance of success if the tactical techniques discussed previouslyare followed. But remember, your group is most likely not the only trained groupout there, and everyone is in a survival situation, which makes everything fair,including the finding and taking of someone else’s cache site. You must becomean expert at restoring the area to its natural look. This is easier said thandone.When choosing rural cache sites, pick areas that would not lend themselves todevelopment—not that you would have this worry after the disaster—such as steephills, cliff areas, scree slopes, etc. Before the disaster, caching in an areawhere you plan to leave the cache until needed may be a problem if a developerbuilds a housing area over your cache. I have heard stories of this actuallyhappening to people before. With GPSs available, always have a GPS coordinate ofthe site. Stay away from power lines and outstanding or known natural sites, asmany folks use these places to look for things buried with metal detectors. Themore remote the area, the better. At the end of the day, there is always achance that either man will find it or nature will take it away. There are noguarantees. As with anything, good planning, research, and proper technique lendthemselves to success."},{"pageContent":"Chapter TenReferencesMy intent is to provide some references for survival-oriented equipment andinformation.

I am sure with a more detailedsearch of the Internet that more manufacturers could be found. Start yourpreparation with the guns you currently own. If you have the weapons recommendedin this book, good. If you have others, you still have the means ofself-defense.Rather than have this chapter be hundreds of pages long, I will put theequipment name and then a suggested term to type into your computer. Allsuggestions were tried by me personally and were satisfactory for my quest forinformation.Tactical EquipmentThere are many tactical equipment manufacturers, and you will have to make yourown choices. Tactical equipment, such as harnesses, vests, belts, and otherequipment carriers, is the difference between carrying your equipmentcomfortably and organized to where you can get to needed gear quickly whensituations require it or fumbling around for it while someone kills you. Onceyou start acquiring the equipment, practice with it in training. You should beable to access any gear on your body in the dark or under duress. A well-trainedgroup will have the same equipment in the same place on their gear so if amember is injured, others could find it in the dark. Also, where singular piecesof critical equipment are being carried by a single group member should be knownby all. This is good tactical planning that leaves nothing to chance.Water PurificationThere are several survival straws and items of survival purification equipmentthat come up. Remember that polluted water will kill you as surely as anyweapon. Do not take a chance on any water found after disaster—purify it byboiling or filtering. Many purification systems can be found using your searchengine. Purifying water will be an absolute necessity for survival.steripen.com [http://steripen.com] – potableaqua.com [http://potableaqua.com] –buylifestraw.com [http://buylifestraw.com] – katadyn.com [http://katadyn.com] –renovowater.com [http://renovowater.com] – arcticfilters.com[http://arcticfilters.com]Commercial Water DistillersThese small water distillers only require heat from a stove or fire to turndirty water into steam and back into drinkable water. They are a great survivaltool to ensure the group is drinking safe water.waterwise.com [http://waterwise.com] – survivalstill.com[http://survivalstill.com]Survival Food SourcesSurvival food websites such as WiseFoodStorage.com [http://WiseFoodStorage.com],BuyEmergencyFoods.com [http://BuyEmergencyFoods.com], PrepareWise.com[http://PrepareWise.com], and foodinsurance.com [http://foodinsurance.com] donot cover what can be bought in grocery stores, such as beans, rice, buckwheat,etc. All have a use and will provide you with packaged and secure food that hasa long shelf life, which will be needed for any long-term survival. Spoiled orbad food can be just as deadly or incapacitating as bad water. You cannot affordto become so debilitated that you cannot function nor do what has to be done inan emergency. Check all food before eating, and purify all water beforedrinking.Fire Starting SourcesThere are several commercial fire starters on the market. I am an old guy whohas started fires in some terrible conditions with just matches and the wood Icould find. Some was cut from downed logs and standing dead trees. It took time,and I suspect in any cold, rain, or snow situation it will be hard to find drywood or tinder. There are some fire starters worth looking at.Lightning-strike fire starter – hollandguns.com [http://hollandguns.com]The blast match fire starter is another commercial starter. Type in blast matchin your search engine.Survival Fast Fire Kit – solkoasurvival.com [http://solkoasurvival.com]There are many other fire starters that can be found with a simple search onyour computer. One of my standby favorites is homemade of melted wax, woodchips, and fire starter fluid hardened into small blocks. It works every time aflame is put to it. But do not get me wrong, starting a fire in the dark whileit’s raining will not be something to look forward to.Field StovesAnyone with a little knowledge can make a camp or hobo stove. Small fire pitsare also used to cook food and heat water. I am putting a couple of commercialfield stoves in here because they concentrate the heat for quicker cooking withless wood. There are many others out there, and sporting goods or camping storeshave a large variety. I am listing a couple here that work with wood, are small,and are easily used. I think a quick look at the following websites will giveyou an idea of several choices that are available.solostove.com [http://solostove.com] – firebox.com [http://firebox.com]Groups who have a plan to move to a rural location should include at least twogood wood-burning cooking stoves in their survival location. They should alsohave extra parts, such as glass, handles, and any other parts that may needreplacing over time. A trip to a wood stove store would get any questions youhave answered. Keep in mind, if you live in an area with harsh winters, basicsurvival will be decided by your ability to heat your location. Also keep inmind that the heating of your location with fire will give your location away bysight and smell to anyone in the area.Tie-Down StrapsYou will need several different tie-down straps, come-a-longs, and tow straps toassist your move to a rural site, to secure equipment in your survival site, orto barricade your survival site. I will list a couple of websites here to helpyour search. Tie-downs and tow straps are easily found at retail stores. Likemost special need items, when you need them and do not have them, almost nothingelse will do.titanstraps.com [http://titanstraps.com] – americanriggingsupply.com[http://americanriggingsupply.com]image [../Images/176-1.jpg]Keep in mind that the heating of your location with fire could give yourlocation away. (zlikovec, courtesy of iStock)FlashlightsHaving the ability to see at night will be mandatory. You will never have enoughbatteries and will eventually run out, but to start you need a good, durable,tactical-grade flashlight. The following websites are suggestions to start yoursearch, but there are many others easily found. The decisions must be yours. Ihave also verified over the years that you can never have enough flashlights, soget more than one per group member.surefire.com [http://surefire.com] – 511tactical.com [http://511tactical.com] –nitecore.com [http://nitecore.com] – streamlight.com [http://streamlight.com]Night VisionI believe night vision is critical to success in night operations, and that willnot change in a survival situation. If a group can afford them, I highlyrecommend having them. They have saved my life several times in my past careers.If looters or raiders have them and the people they are attacking do not, thereis a good chance the looters will win. There are many night vision and thermaldevices available. Like any other piece of equipment, they must be trained onand maintained by the user. I also know if time runs out and disaster strikes,only a miniscule part of the nation’s population will have night vision devicesin their possession.tnvc.com [http://tnvc.com] – opticsplanet.com [http://opticsplanet.com] –nvdepot.com [http://nvdepot.com]Medical KitsIf serious injuries occur after disaster strikes, you are in trouble. Using myown experience, I am trained to give first aid for trauma wounds. I can stop thebleeding, ensure airways are open, and treat or prevent shock, and I have donethis several times on the battlefield. However, I can tell you if a close familymember is shot in the head, chest, or stomach, if I cannot call 911 or get himor her to a hospital, he or she is going to die. I cannot perform surgerywithout a 95 percent chance that I would be the one who caused his or her death.By all means, you should get medical training and have a good kit available, butunless you are a surgeon with the right tools, you are going to watch seriouslyinjured group members die. There is no discussion for individual survivors—ifyou get shot in a vital area, you will die.promedkits.com [http://promedkits.com] – adventuremedicalkits.com[http://adventuremedicalkits.com] – first-aid-product.com[http://first-aid-product.com] – survival-supply.com[http://survival-supply.com]This chapter is to get you started. You will never have enough equipment to liveyour life like you did before disaster strikes. I believe the quicker you acceptthis and adapt to your new situation, the better you will do. As time goes byafter the disaster and you continue to survive, all the materials in your areawill become available to you as people die or leave. This guarantees nothingother than if the group is smart and takes the initiative, you can make yourlife more secure or comfortable with the equipment you acquire. However, youwill still have to do everything within a tactical and survival situation. Wecurrently live in a world that is fairly secure, but should disaster strike,everything we need to have a comfortable life will be taken away from us."},{"pageContent":"Chapter ElevenLife AfterI have been asked to give an example of life after the disaster as I see it. Iwill try to present it as I envision the unending Survive While Survivinglifestyle that will be forced upon us.Thirty Days After DisasterMary was at her security position at the back bedroom window of the group’ssurvival location. She, along with the other three members, had been on sincetwo in the morning. It was now around six and starting to get light. She was alittle hungry but not really bad. The group leaders had started seriousrationing of the group’s store of food once the lights went out and did not comeback on. There had been riots downtown, and she could see the smoke rising fromseveral fires. She looked around the room at the piles of equipment the grouphad been smart enough to acquire before the disaster and the sleeping forms ofother group members laying among the equipment. She was looking forward to a fewhours of sleep once she was relieved by the day crew.She looked out over the yard and into the field of grass that was an empty lotbehind the group’s survival location. Nothing was moving yet. They had beenfairly lucky—so far there had been several groups of people—probably potentiallooters the group leaders had warned about—but all had vacated the area oncethey were challenged by armed group members. On one occasion a week ago, two menactually got close to the house and were shot by the day crew when they raisedtheir weapons. Both were killed and their bodies stripped of weapons,ammunition, packs, and clothes. Their bodies had been buried in the center ofthe vacant lot in shallow graves.The only other thing of consequence was a gang of around twenty men and women,some armed with rifles, seen walking two blocks from the house, but they weregoing toward town and were not seen again. It was now light enough to seeseveral blocks away, and she knew the day crew would be relieving her soon. Asshe was glancing out over the vacant field, a slight movement caught herattention. She looked at the area but could see nothing else. She thought itmight have been a small rodent or rabbit. She lifted her rifle and lookedthrough the nine-power scope directly at the location of the movement. Shejumped in surprise when a rifle barrel and a gloved hand appeared to be layingin the grass. As she looked closer through the scope, she realized she waslooking at a well-camouflaged person crawling toward the house.Without looking she kicked the closest sleeping group member, who awoke with astart. She whispered, “Get everyone up quietly, we have people moving on us. Geteveryone into their defensive positions.” As group members were awakened andmoved into their positions, she looked back through the scope. She could now seethat the individual was closer. She also knew she would not be able to see himwith her naked eye unless she knew exactly where to look—this individual was thepoint of coming trouble. She sighted in on what she determined to be the headand took a well-aimed shot. She was surprised by the spray of blood and thesight of the target rolling sideways and then laying still. His rifle was nowcompletely exposed. Almost immediately, several bullets hit the side of thehouse and ricocheted loudly off the brick walls. One or two bullets came throughthe firing port in the window and missed Mary by inches. Then it all becamequiet.Ben, one of the group leaders, slid up beside her and looked around the edge ofthe firing port. Mary explained what she had seen, and the inert body spoke foritself. Ben turned and said, “Good job, kid. Had you not been on this, we wouldhave had some real close-range problems. We still need to see what we havehere.” As if on signal, two more rounds came through the firing port and missedBen by inches. Ben said, “They are good shots and most likely using scopedrifles. Everyone needs to stay out of sight and observe from cover.” Two shotsrang out from the front room of the structure, and a group member said, “Onedown!” In the front yard, three others were moving away. Ben felt like he wasback in the Army and Iraq all over again.An hour later, no further movement had been seen, and no shots had been fired.While half the group ate their morning rations, half the group watched. All wereglad the group had cleared the immediate surrounding areas of brush and cover.Ben looked around at the group. Everyone had their gear on per group practices,and their weapons were ready. Ben knew the group of thirty-four was in goodshape with food, water, and ammunition stores on hand. He made a quick decisionthat no gathering party was going out today until they determined what they wereup against. One of the things the group had done after assembling was cuttingthree holes in the walls at ceiling level on the second floor. Group memberswere now looking through these with binoculars and were positive that whoeverhad attacked them had withdrawn from the area.It was determined that a three-man security group would exit the back of thebuilding and patrol out to the end of the survival site’s observation or threehundred yards, whichever came first, while covered by the survival site. Thethree group members, following instructions, broke cover once outside, ran tenmeters, and dropped into prone position. No shots were fired at them, and thesecond-story observers reported no sightings of movement or people. An hourlater, the patrol was back. There had been no sightings. A detail was sent outto strip the two bodies and bury them in the field. A group meeting was thenheld, and all were in attendance except the eight guards—two on each side of thesurvival site with four downstairs and four on the second floor—all with scopedrifles or binoculars. The meeting opened with good news; Mary was congratulatedfor her good work, and it was reported that two very good scoped rifles, threecombat pistols, and other gear was taken from the two bodies.The bad news was that they had been found by a well-trained and equipped group.How large the group was not known, so it was decided the extra four guards wouldstay on each shift throughout the night and everyone would sleep with theirfighting gear on. If no action was taken against them, a gathering and reconpatrol party would depart at first light. The party would be covered by thesurvival location until out of sight. The group leaders knew they had gottenaway lucky that morning, but bad things were coming the group’s way. If nothingelse, whoever tried them this morning would want revenge for the two of theirgroup that were lost. The gathering and recon party was picked, and theyimmediately started planning the move out of the survival site and the routethey would take on their mission. Everyone knew the upgraded actions that werenow in place would become a daily way of life for the group. Because of theunknown tactical situation, the gathering and recon party would not use any ofthe group’s vehicles. They would move on foot with designated group members as areaction force if they made contact. The group would not use their vehiclesunless absolutely necessary, as available fuel was, as far as the group knew,nonexistent in the local area.This short story is certainly close to what will happen in the event of a realdisaster. The group was well trained and weathered the event, but had they notbeen trained or had they been a single family, they most likely would not havesurvived the morning. The sad thing here is that the untrained among us are themajority of the population. Should disaster strike, many will quickly findthemselves in dire danger that they may not be able to fend off.If you look at this short scenario from a tactical standpoint, you can come to alot of conclusions. One would be that the group did well because Mary was awakeand doing her job. Had she fallen asleep or not been focused on the job at hand,the group would have at least taken some casualties from a close-range attack.At worst it could have either been run out of its well-stocked survival locationor been wiped out. In critical situations, it is often the little things thatkeep you alive. Mary taking a short nap at a critical time could have been adisaster the group may not have survived.A second conclusion could have been different than depicted in this scenario.The three-man security patrol could have been ambushed and one or all of themkilled. The group then would have found themselves in a standoff with an unknownnumber of attackers. Also, the burying party that went out could have beenattacked by a returning attack group. Ben and his group would then be faced withseveral possibilities from going out to save the burying party to losing themand being in a standoff situation with the attackers. The following morning, thegathering and recon patrol party could have been ambushed and sustained manycasualties, which would have immediately affected Ben’s group and forced someserious decisions or actions.Another scenario could have been that the attacking group was large and had thecapability to put the survival site under siege. The group in the survival sitewould have some serious decisions regarding whether could they break the siege.Would accurate fire on the attackers break the siege? Would the group have toraid outside the site to break the siege? A multitude of possibilities would endin the group’s success or demise.I mention these possibilities to get you thinking about how fragile yourexistence may be in a survival situation and how quickly your situation canchange for the worse. Even doing everything correctly does not mean thatunplanned situations will not plague you and threaten the group’s survival. Theability to adapt and react to unplanned events is critical and is always donebetter by prepared and trained disciplined groups. There is no news here forexperienced professionals but mandatory reading and understanding by everyoneelse. Your survival under severe circumstances stands in the balance."},{"pageContent":"Chapter TwelveFinal ThoughtsHopefully, this book will be read by people who will never need it. Beingprepared is just good common sense, but having to live in a survival andtactical situation is a backbreaking, mind-numbing lifestyle that I do not wishon anyone. The truth is, I believe that it is a possibility based on ongoingworld events, but hopefully I am wrong. Whatever event kicks off a nationaldisaster—a power grid failure, national anarchy, or a natural disaster withnational implications—really makes no difference. If it goes long term, asdiscussed in this book, the results will be the same. With my career experience,I cannot fully determine what will happen if the population’s vital services aresuddenly cut off. I do know that in our large population centers, it will turnviolent quickly, and people will have to be prepared to defend themselves andthe goods they possess. To see how quickly things can go bad, just look atFerguson, Baltimore, and the Rodney King riots.As this book is being written, the news is full of reports that do not look goodfor the future. Some recent reports include:• If the national power grid is disrupted for a year, possibly 90 percent ofthe population may perish.• Homeland security and FEMA are unprepared for a nuclear attack or majornatural disaster.• Major terrorist attacks should be expected.• Civil unrest on a national scale is possible.• An EMP attack could be launched from any of several countries, which wouldknock out all power-generating capabilities nationwide.• The national and international financial systems may collapse.This is a short list of what is being reported. If you put it together with weakor nonexistent leadership from our nation’s capital, at least some of what wehave talked about in this book is possible—most likely with no warning. Withthat being said, I want readers of this book to ask themselves some questions.• How prepared are you if you had to survive for three months starting rightnow?• If five looters came onto your property and started forcing their way intoyour house, do you have the means to stop them?• What emergency family plans have you made and rehearsed?• If major rioting broke out, forcing you from your home, where are you goingand how are you going to get there?• If you have family members on life support requiring electricity, what isthe plan for them if power is interrupted indefinitely?If your answers to these questions are “I do not know,” there is a good chanceyou will be part of the predicted 90 percent who do not make it. You hear allthe time that it will happen sooner rather than later, that could be within thehour, or within the time you have left to live. It comes down to responsibility.It is your duty to prepare to protect your family or the people who depend onyou. If you’re alone, it’s your responsibility to care for yourself and anybodyaround you that needs help. It’s been that way throughout history, and many havestepped up and taken that responsibility, but many have waited until too late.What are your thoughts? If you read this book, you know mine.I believe some areas will maintain some form of society and control of thesituation. If you are in an area where this happens, the support of the effortto maintain order is paramount and a benefit to all. Everyone needs to pulltogether to make it work. These areas should also be on their guard for lootersor raiders from outside the area. It’s a given that if large areas of thecountry are in crisis mode, sooner or later it will bleed over into the areasthat are not. It is also a given that groups of looters and raiders may be largein numbers and well armed.With total long-term disaster not previously happening in our country, there isno actual history of what would really take place over the long term, but a goodcase can be made by looking at some of the short-term disasters, such asKatrina. We all know what went on in New Orleans in the week after the storm.What if no federal or state help was available? I believe the looting, survivalactions of starving people and those trapped by high waters, would be enhancedmany times over and would force the moves and actions discussed in this book byboth security forces and the general populace.Looking at what is going on with the demonstrations against police in many ofour major cities, it is not hard to feel that anarchy is only a step away.Should major rioting break out, all survival and defense situations will startto impact millions of people in our big cities—even if it only lasted a fewdays. If you and your family were caught up in it, do you have the means tosurvive the incident? If you want to fully understand what happens when there isno security force to put a stop to it when a population is unprepared and notequipped to take care of itself, you only have to turn on the news to see whatISIS is doing to the Yazidi tribe and other people in the areas it has captured.I made reference in this book to what happens when an armed violent groupattacks an unarmed group, and the result historically is that the unarmed andunprepared group ceases to exist or is used as the armed group sees fit.A while back I had a conversation with a young man who is preparing, and hisidea was to have some cows, goats, and pigs on his survival site. He is in arural area and can certainly entertain that thought and get the animals, and inthe preparation phase this will work. Once disaster strikes and a long-termsituation exists, anyone with animals will have to change the way they dobusiness. The first question once feed stores are no longer operating is goingto be to feed them. Once disaster strikes, any animals will be targeted as afood source and will have to be guarded, which is another job requiringfull-time people. In this situation, animals cannot be allowed to graze freerange, as they will not be around long in that situation. Having any animalswill put additional guard and maintenance requirements on the group. It is agood idea to have them, but it also puts a heavy workload on the group. Thatworkload may include building a secure area to keep them in, the planting andgrowing of feed, and a larger group or the chance of losing the animals and allthey provide.Winters in some of our states, including where I live, produce subzero weatherwith high winds, which brings the chill factor down as low as thirty to fiftybelow zero. I have been asked how you manage to survive during this type ofweather. An easy answer is that you don’t if away from support or home, and manypeople in these areas who make mistakes in travel planning or breakdowns do not.In normal times, with heating and utilities available, it’s fairly easy; justpay your bills and plan. In a survival situation, you will find yourself in atriple-threat situation of surviving, Surviving While Surviving, and maintaininga warm shelter out of the wind with a full-time fire. This situation puts anadded logistical responsibility of procuring firewood on you. If firewood isscarce and the area you are in has harsh winters, a move to a new location maybe forced. Planning and awareness should prevent this from catching the group bysurprise. The impact on Surviving While Surviving or the tactical situation isthat everyone will be confined to dealing with the same conditions. Other groupswill be looking to loot firewood, thus adding to everyone’s guard and tacticalrequirements.When living in an area where winters are harsh, all winter clothing and beddingmust be stored and maintained during the summer months. Should the group be runout of the survival site by circumstances, the winter gear must leave with themor they are on borrowed time. The maintaining of gear required for survivalduring harsh weather conditions is another primary planning point that cannot beignored. There is a tendency during summer weather to forget about winter gear,but this cannot be done in a survival situation. As the people who live inremote areas of Alaska or some of our mountain states know, preparation for thenext winter starts when the current one is over.One of the things I wonder about is what government support can be counted on ifdisaster strikes. I have been told a few times in discussions that if a nationaldisaster strikes, people will, for a time, have to do what they must to survive.My question is what does that mean? Does it mean it is okay to become a looteror raider? Is it okay to take someone else’s food and water by force—maybehurting or killing them in doing so? To this question, I cannot get a straightanswer. I suspect it means we’re in it alone, and if or when things stabilize,politicians will be looking to press charges against individuals who did whatthey did to survive. There are, again, no good answers here. In my mind,self-defense is self-defense if you are the one being attacked. I guess undercurrent thoughts of the leaders I’ve talked to, if you are looting, you aredoing what you have to in the survival situation you are in.There are a lot of good, organized people in every community, and if theseindividuals are trying to restore some semblance of order, it should not be loston individuals and groups that aligning themselves with these efforts willbenefit all concerned. Should disaster strike on a national or world order,nothing will be simple again. The more orderly and independent communities insmaller population areas can become, the more they may be the best places to be,as they will be able to get the work done that will ensure survival andcommunity protection. This does not mean acquiring food and water will beeasier, but with an organized community-sized group taking part in hunting,fishing, and gardening, the chance of success is raised considerably.It should not be lost on anybody that the more people you can bring togetherwith talent and knowledge, the more you will have available to ensure thesuccess of the effort. In the past, there have been groups that could have beensuccessful in their endeavors but were destroyed by infighting anddisorganization. I have only one recommendation here, and that is leaders mustnot let this happen and must guard against it. In saying that, it ultimatelywill be up to the community should disaster strike. Like most things in thisbook, I can give advice but in the end will have no control over anyone otherthan the group I am with. If luck or situation goes against me, I may not havecontrol over what happens to my group or myself.You will always need more equipment than you have—that is a given. If you havethe people or transportation to carry it, there are no issues, but if you donot, all decisions you make in what you keep or discard will be life or deathdecisions. Unfortunately, the ability to make some decisions comes fromexperience. In this situation, I can only wish you luck in making the rightones. I do not intend for this book to make you think all is lost. There isalways hope, and any training or preparation you do before the disaster will goa long way toward your hopes coming true, but there are no guarantees.This book cannot guarantee your success; neither can any experts guarantee yoursuccess should disaster strike. You and your group, if you have one, will be atthe mercy of good or bad luck and fate. Prior preparation and training willincrease your ability to survive but will not guarantee it. It is a given thatmost untrained people are looking for perfect answers when training or readingnew material, but I can safely tell you that there are none. Go into everythingwith an open mind, learn what you can, and acquire what you can to assist yourefforts, but count on nothing going the way you may want it to be.Should there be a long-term disaster, each group and individual will initiallymake decisions based on what is in their best interests. Countries do that now.I have no issues with that, as I will be doing the same thing, but I cautioneveryone to keep an open mind. If there are local governments still working,check them out. It may be in the group’s best interest to join them, but it mayalso be in the group’s best interest to move out of the area. Those decisionswill probably be life or death decisions. The main thing to look for is thateveryone is being treated equally and fairly; there should be no second-classcitizens.With the information contained in this book, you have enough information tostart your preparation. The individuals and groups out there that are and havebeen preparing for disaster already know about the information I have put inthis chapter and, most likely, in this book. If I have put anything in this bookthat those preparing said upon reading, “I didn’t think of that,” then this bookis a double success. Hopefully this information convinces those not preparing tostart and assists those that are preparing to be more effective in what they aredoing. We all may be going into a situation where we will have to Survive WhileSurviving. Good luck to both groups in all you do.The comments and suggestions in this book are my own and are based on afifty-three-year career in the tactical and security fields. I have been to manycountries where, due to politics, certain groups and tribal hatreds cause peopleto live a survival lifestyle. I know what it looks like. I also know my owncountry’s history and the violence that lives just below the surface of ourcivilization. Should disaster strike on a national level, in most areas of thiscountry we will certainly step back hundreds, if not thousands, of years. With apopulation that has mostly had everything available to them, I cannot seeanything but what has been depicted in this book. I hope I am wrong, but onlyhistory will be the judge of that.Steve Mattoon2016"},{"pageContent":"GlossaryAmbushA surprise attack against an unsuspecting enemy or group, usually from aprepared
