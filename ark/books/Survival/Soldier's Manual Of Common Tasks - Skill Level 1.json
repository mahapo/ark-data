Commanders, trainers, and soldiers will use this manual and STP 21-24-SMCT, Soldier's Manual of Common Tasks, Skill Levels 2, 3, and 4 , to plan, conduct, sustain, and evaluate individual training of common tasks in units. This manual contains a common task training plan for skill levels (SL) 1 through 4 and task summaries for SL 1 critical common tasks that support unit wartime missions. This manual is the only authorized source for these common tasks. Task summaries in this manual supersede any common tasks appearing in MOS-specific soldier's manuals. Training support information, such as refe rence materials, is also included. Trainers and first-line supervisors should ensure SL 1 soldiers have access to this publication in their work areas, uni t learning centers, and unit libraries. This manual applies to both active and reserve component soldiers. Unless this manual states otherwise, masculine pronouns do not refer exclusively to men. The proponent of this publication is the Commander, United States Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), with the Commander, United States Army Training Support Center (ATSC) designated as the principle publishing, printing and distribution age ncy. Proponents for the specific tasks are the Army schools and agencies as identified by the school code, listed at appendix A. This code consists of the first three digits of the task identification number. All comments, suggestions, and recommended changes to this publication should be submitted as follows: Record any comments or questions regarding the task summaries contained in this manual on a DA Form 2028 ( Recommended Changes to Publications and Blank Forms ) and send it to the respective task proponent with information copies forwarded to: Commander, U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, ATTN: ATTG-I, Fort Monroe, VA 23651-5000, and Commander, U.S. Army Training Support Center, ATTN: ATIC-ITSC-CM, Fort Eustis, VA 23604-5166."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" vii SPECIAL NOTES CONCERNING THE AUGUST 2003 SMCT 5” X 7” Format. Beginning with the August 2003 revisions, both the STP 21-1-SMCT and STP 21-24-SMCT are printed in 5”x7” format, following the very favorable acceptance of previous skill level 1 SMCTs which inaugurated the “pocket-size” manuals. This, however, has precluded incorporating full- size reproducible forms at the end of the books. Instead, a Guide to Forms (Appendix B) is now provided which, in the online versions of the new manuals, contains electronic links to the downloadable, reproducible forms. Where online access is not available, t he soldier’s unit often has hard copies of the forms, or can obtain them. Land navigation skills and knowledge, for common tasks 071-329-1006, Navigate from One Point on the Ground to Another Point While Dismounted, and 071-329-1030, Navigate from One Point on the Ground to Another Point While Mounted are grouped in Appendi x C, identified by the grey-edged pages near the end of this manual. Task 052-192-1135, Locate Mines by Probing . Performance standards for this task are now incorporated into task 052-192-1042, Perform Self- Extraction from a Mined Area. These standards are further updated from the 18 March 03 revision of Locate Mines by Probing. Task 071-730-0014, Identify Combat Vehicles . This task, uniquely, incorporates a Windows-based onli ne option (ROC-V, Recognition of Combat Vehicles) for training and testing soldiers. In addition to teaching thermal and visual identification cues of vehicles and practical use of thermal sensor image controls, the program ensures identification standards are current, irrespective of print date of this manual. Refer to the Evaluation Preparation section of this task for instructions on accessing the ROC-V program."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" viii SPECIAL NOTE FROM THE STAFF CONCERNING THE REVISED SMCT Experienced trainers will notice that, in addition to the numerous new tasks in the revised SMCT, there are many tasks for which the skill level has been lowered from that in the past. This reflects results from the recent survey of approximately 19,000 enlisted soldiers , their commanders, and senior leaders, to determine who was actually performing certain tasks , and the amount of learning that was actually filtering down in the “one room schoolhouse” of the working Army. When it was established that a significant percentage of soldiers were performing those tasks at skill levels that were above their own, it was decided to lower the task designation, giving trainers—and the Army—the full advantage of accelerated learning at every level. This SMCT, if anything, reflects back to its users a faithfulness to this spirit of Army training from whom it derived, an allegiance and gratitude to the profession and legacy of every United States Army soldier. Thank you. United States Army Training and Doctrine Command United States Army Training Support Center "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 1-1 Chapter 1 Introduction to the SMCT System 1-1. GENERAL Training prepares soldiers, leaders, and units to fight and win in combat— the Army's basic mission. As explained in the Army's CAPSTONE training document, FM 7-0 Training the Force, units do not have the time and resources to achieve and sustain proficiency on every possible training task. Commanders must identify the unit's cr itical wartime tasks. These tasks make up the unit's Mission Essential Task List (METL). Commanders use this list to develop their unit trai ning plan. Noncommissi oned Officer (NCO) trainers then plan the individual training that soldiers in the unit need to accomplish the METL. The soldier training publications (STP), also known as soldier's manuals (SMs ), provide the critical individual tasks for each military occupational specialty (MOS) t hat support the unit's full spectrum of missions. The NCO trainer uses the tasks in the SMs to train the soldiers and measure the soldier's proficiency on these unit critical tasks. The manuals provide task performance and ev aluation criteria and are the basis for individual training and evaluation in the unit and for task-based evaluation during resident training. 1-2. PURPOSE The Soldier's Manual of Common Tasks (SMCT), Skill Level (SL) I, contains the common tasks that are essential to the Army's ability to win on the modern battlefield. In the event of war, regardless of job or individual MOS, each soldier risks exposure to hostile ac tions. This man ual contains the common tasks that soldiers must be able to perform to fight, survive, and win in combat. The SMCT provides the commander, NC O trainer or first-line supervisor, and individual soldiers with the information necessary to support integration and sustainment training in their units. This information allows trainers to plan, prepare, train, evaluate, and monitor individual training of common tasks. Using the approp riate mission training pl an (MTP), MOS specific STPs, and this manual, will help provide the foundation for an effective unit training plan. 1-3. COMMANDER'S RESPONSIBILITIES The commander at each level develops a unit METL in consultation with the command sergeant major and subordinate commanders. Using the Training Planning Process described in FM 7-0, the commander develops the METL and then determines the level of training needed to attain and maintain proficiency. After determining t he necessary training, the commander"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 1-2 develops a strategy to accomplish the required training. The commander also gives his or her trainers the guidance they need to carry out this strategy. Each commander must design a unit training plan that prepares the unit for the full spectrum of oper ations. Soldiers must develop and sustain proficiency in the critical tasks for their MOS and skill level. The commander's unit training program should provide individual training for all soldiers assigned to the unit and routinely evaluate soldier proficiency. The leader's assessment and the Common Task Test (CTT) are two tools that give the trainer and commander feedback on the status of training for individuals and for the unit. This feedback should also be integrated with collective training such as the MTP and crew drills. The Common Task Training Plan, located in Chapter 2 , provides information on where the common tasks are first trained to standard and how often the tasks should be trained to maintain proficiency. Based on the commander's guidance, individual training in the unit is the responsibility of the NCO trainers. The commander must give the NCO trainer the priorities, resources, and direction needed to carry out training. He or she must also assess the training results of the MTP and other training events, and adjust the training plan accordingly. To develop a training program, we recommend the following seven-step approach: Step 1. Set the objectives for training. Step 2. Plan the resources (personnel, time, funds, facilities, devices, training aids). Step 3. Train the trainers. Step 4. Provide the resources. Step 5. Manage risks, environmental and safety considerations. Step 6. Conduct the training. Step 7. Evaluate the results. 1-4. TRAINER'S RESPONSIBILITIES Trainers use the steps below to plan and evaluate training. a. Identify individual training requirements . The NCO determines which tasks soldiers need to train based on the commander's training strategy. The unit's training plan, METL, MTP, and the Common Task Training Plan (Chapter 2) are source s for helping the trainer define the individual training needed. b. Plan the training. Plan individual training based on the unit’s training plan. Be prepared to take advantage of opportunities to conduct individual training (“hip pocket” training). c. Gather the training references and materials. The task summaries list references that can assist the trainer in preparing for the training of that"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 1-3 task. Check the Reimer Digital Library to see if any new resources have been added. d. Manage risks and envir onmental and safety concerns. Assess the risks involved in training a specific task under the conditions current at the time you are scheduled to train and implement controls, if necessary, to lessen the risk level. Ensure that your training preparation takes into account those cautions, warnings, and dangers associated with each task as well as environmental and safety concerns. e. Train each soldier. Show the soldier how to do the task to standard and explain step-by-step how to do the task. Give each soldier a chance to practice the task step-by-step. f. Emphasize training in Mission-Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) Level 4 clothing . Soldiers have difficulty performing even very simple tasks in a nuclear/chemical environment. The combat effectiveness of the soldier and the unit can degrade quickly when trying to perform in MOPP 4. Practice is the best way to improve per formance. The trainer is responsible for training and evaluating soldiers in MOPP 4 so that they are able to perform critical tasks to standards within a nuclear/chemical environment. g. Check each soldier. Evaluate how well each soldier performs the tasks in this manual. Conduct these ev aluations during indi vidual training sessions or while evaluating individual proficiency during the conduct of unit collective tasks. This manual provides a training and evaluation guide for each task to enhance the trainer's abi lity to conduct year-round, hands-on evaluations of tasks critical to the unit's mission. Use the informa tion in the Common Task Training Plan as a guide to determine how often to train the solder on each task to maintain proficiency. h. Record the results. Use the leader book referred to in FM 7-10 to record task performance. This gives the leader total flexibility on the method of recording training. The trainer may use DA Form 5164-R (Hands-on Evaluation} and DA Form 5165-R (Field Expedient Squad Book} as part of the leader book. These forms are optional and locally reproducible. More information on the use of these forms is provided in Appendix B of this manual. i. Retrain and evaluate. Work with each soldier until the individual performs the task to standard. Well-pl anned, integrated training increases the professional competence of eac h soldier and contributes to the development of an efficient unit. The NCO or first-line supervisor is a vital link in the conduct of training. 1-5. SOLDIER'S RESPONSIBILITIES Each soldier must be able to perform t he individual tasks that the first-line supervisor has identified based on the unit's METL. The soldier must perform the task to the standard listed in the SMCT. If a soldier has a"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" 1-4 question about how to do a task, or which tasks in this manual he or she must perform, it is the soldier's respons ibility to go to the first-line supervisor for clarification. The first-line supervisor knows how to perform each task or can direct the soldier to the appropriate training materials. Additionally, each soldier should— a. Know the training progression for both the common critical tasks and their MOS specific critical tasks for t heir skill level. Lists of the critical tasks can be found in Chapter 2 of th is manual (for common tasks) and the STP for their specific MOS (MOS specific tasks). b. Check the Reimer Digital Library for new training materials to support self-development either to ma intain previously trained tasks or to learn new tasks. 1-6. TASK SUMMARIES Task summaries document the performanc e requirements of a critical common task. They provide the soldier and the trainer with the information necessary to evaluate critical tasks. The format for the task summaries is— a. Task Title. The task title identifies the action to be performed. b. Task Number. A l0-digit number that identifies each task. The first three digits of the number represent the proponent code for that task. (A list of the proponent codes is given in Appendix A.) Include the entire 10-digit task number, along with the task title, in any correspondence relating to the task. c. Conditions. The task conditions identify all the equipment, tools, materials, references, job aids, and su pporting personnel that the soldier needs to perform the task. This section identifies any environmental conditions that can alter task performance such as visibility, temperature, or wind. This section also identifies any sp ecific cues or events (for example, a chemical attack or identification of an unexploded ordnance hazard) that trigger task performance. d. Standard. A task standard specifies the requirements for task performance by indicating how well, completely, or accurately a product must be produced, a process must be performed, or both. Standards are described in terms of accuracy, toler ances, completeness, format, clarity, number of errors, quantity, sequence, or speed of performance. e. Training and Evaluation Guide. This section has two parts. The first part, Performance Steps, lists the indivi dual steps that the soldier must complete to perform the task. The second part is the Performance Evaluation Guide. This provides guidance on how to evaluate a soldier’s performance of the task. It is composed of three subsections. The Evaluation Preparation subsection identifi es special setup procedures and, if required, instructions for evaluating the task performance. Sometimes the conditions and standard must be modifi ed so that the task can be evaluated"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" 1-5 in a situation that does not exactly dup licate actual field performance. This subsection may also include instructions that the evaluator should give to the soldier before the performance test. The Performance Measures subsection identifies the criteria for acceptable task performance. The soldier is rated (GO/NO GO) on how well he or she perfo rms specific actions or produces specific products. As indicated in the Evaluation Guidance subsection, the soldier must score a GO on all or specified performance measures to receive a GO on the task. f. References. This section identifies references that provide more detailed and thorough explanations of task performance requirements than that given in the task summary descripti on. This section identifies resources the soldier can use to improve or maintain performance. Additionally, task summaries can includ e safety statements, environmental considerations, and notes. Safety st atements (danger, warning, caution) alert users to the possibility of immediate death, personal injury, or damage to equipment. Notes provide additional information to support task performance. 1-7. EVALUATING TASK PERFORMANCE Trainers need to keep the following points in mind when preparing to evaluate their soldiers— a. Review the performance measures to become familiar with the criteria on which the soldier will be scored. b. Ensure that all necessary equipment and clothing needed for proper performance of the job are on hand at the training site. Don’t forget to include safety equipment. c. Prepare the test site according to the conditions section of the task summary. Some tasks contain special ev aluation preparation instructions. These instructions tell the trainer what modifications must be made to the job conditions to evaluate the task. Reset the site to its original condition after evaluating each soldier to ensure that the conditions are the same for each soldier. d. Advise each soldier of any special guidance that appears in the Evaluation Preparation section of t he task summary before evaluating. e. Score each soldier based on the information in the Performance Measures and Evaluation Guidance sections. f. Record the date and task perfo rmance score (\"GO\" or \"NO GO\") in the Leader Book."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 1-6 1-8. TRAINING TIPS FOR TRAINERS a.

COMMON TASK TRAINING PLAN The Common Task Training Plan provides information to help the trainer plan, prepare, train, evaluate, and monitor in dividual training in units. It lists, by general subject area and skill level, the critical common tasks soldiers must perform, the initial training lo cation, and a suggested frequency of training. The training location column uses brevity codes to indicate where the task is first taught to standards. If the task is taught in the unit the word “UNIT” appears in this column. “SD” indicates tasks trained via self- development media. If it is taught in the training base, the brevity code (BCT, OSUT, AIT) of the resident c ourse appears. Brevity codes and resident courses are listed below. ANCOC Advanced NCO Course BNCOC Basic NCO Course PLDC Primary Leadership Development Course BCT Basic Combat Training OSUT One Station Unit Training AIT Advanced Individual Training UNIT Trained in/by the Unit SD Self-Development Training The sustainment training column lists how often (frequency) soldiers should train on the task to ensure they maintain their proficiency. This information is not a requirement, but rather a guide the commander can use to develop a comprehensive unit training plan. The commander, with the unit trainers, is in the best position to determine on which tasks and how often soldiers need training to maintain unit readiness.

Performance Steps 1. Comply with Article I: I am an American, fighting in the forces which guard my country and our way of life. I am prepared to give my life in their defense. Explanation. The code apples to all service members at all times, whether in active combat, in captivity, or in peacetime as a result of hostage situations and terrorist activities. Members of the Armed Forces have a duty to support U.S. interests and op pose U.S. enemies regardless of the circumstances. 2. Comply with Article II: I will never surrender of my own free will. If in command, I will never surrender the members of my command while they still have the means to resist. Explanation. Members of the Armed Forces may never surrender voluntarily. A soldier’s duty is to avoid capture and return to friendly forces even when isolated, and no longer able to inflict casualties on the enemy or otherwise defend themselves. T he means to evade is considered exhausted when escape is impossible. The means to resist is considered exhausted when further fighting would lead to the soldier’s death with no significant loss to the enemy. 3. Comply with Article III: If I am captured, I wi ll continue to resist by all means available. I will make every effort to escape and aid others to escape. I will accept neither parole nor special favors from the enemy. Explanation. Members of the A rmed Forces must understand that a captive situation is to be considered an extension of the battlefield and the enemy has used a variety of tactics to exploit prisoners of war in disregard of the Geneva Convention of 1949 Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War. These efforts have included physical and mental harassment, general mistreatment and torture, medical neglect, and political indoctrination. The duty of a member of the Armed Forces to continue resistance to enemy exploitation by all means available is not lessened by the misfortune of capture."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"   331-202-1049     3-41 Performance Steps 4. Comply with Article IV: If I become a prisoner of war, I will keep faith with my fellow prisoners. I will give no information or take part in any action which might be harmful to my comrades. If I am senior, I will take command. If not, I will obey the lawful orders of those appointed over me and will back them up in every way. Explanation. Officers and noncommissioned officers will continue to carry out their responsibilities and to exer cise their authority in captivity. Informing on fellow prisoners of war (PWs) is forbidden. PWs must especially avoid helping the enemy to identify fellow PWs who have information that is of value to the enemy. These PWs may be made to suffer coercive interrogation because of their knowledge. 5. Comply with Article V: When questioned, should I become a prisoner of war, I am required to give name, rank , service number, and date of birth. I will evade answering further questions to the utmost of my ability. I will make no oral or written statements disloyal to my country and its allies or harmful to their cause. Explanation. When questioned a PW is required by the Geneva Conventions and the Code of Conduct, E.O. 10631 and is permitted by the UCMJ to give name, rank, service num ber and date of birth. Under the Geneva Conventions the enemy has no right to try to force a PW to provide any additional information. However, it is unrealistic to expect a PW to remain confined for years reciting only name, rank, service number and date of birth. There are many PW camp situations in which certain types of conversation with the enemy are permitted. For example, a PW is allowed, but not required by the Code of Conduct, the UCMJ or the Geneva Conventions to fill out a Geneva Convent ions “capture card,” to write letters home, and to communicate with captors on matters of health and welfare. 6. Comply with Article VI: I will never forget that I am an American, fighting for freedom, responsible for my actions, and dedicated to the principles which made my country free. I will trust in my God and in the United States of America. Explanation. A member of the Arm ed Forces remains responsible for personal actions at all times. Article VI is designed to assist members of the Armed Forces to fulfill their responsibilities and survive captivity with honor. The Code of Conduct, E.O. 10631, does not conflict with the UCMJ, and the latter continues to apply to each military member during captivity or other hostile detention. Soldiers, whether detainees or captives, can be assured the U.S. Go vernment will make every effort to obtain their earliest release. Faith in one’s country and its way of life, faith in fellow detainees or captives, and faith in one’s self are critical to surviving with honor and resisting exploitation."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":" 3-42  331-202-1049     Evaluation Preparation: Setup: Develop an exercise scenario based on wartime mission requirements (including geographical areas of deployment).

Get materials to pad the splints, such as a jacket, blanket, poncho, shelter half, or leafy vegetation. c. Get tie materials, such as strips of cloth or belts, to tie the splints. Note. If splinting materials are not avail able, use the chest wall to immobilize a suspected fracture of the arm and an uninjur ed leg to immobilize the fractured leg. Continue with steps 7 and 8. 3. Pad the splints. Apply padding between the splint and the bony areas of the body. Suggested sites for padding: wrist, elbow, ankle, knee, crotch, and armpit. 4. Check for signs of blood circulation problems below the injury. a. Check light-skinned persons for color of skin (skin may be pale, white, or a bluish gray color). b. Check dark-skinned persons by depressing the toenail or fingernail beds and seeing how fast the color return s. A slower return of color to the injured side indicates a circulation problem. c. Check to see if the injured arm or leg feels colder than the uninjured one. d. Ask the casualty about the presenc e of numbness, tightness, or a cold sensation. WARNING If there is a blood circulation problem, evacuate the casualty as soon as possible. 5. Put on a splint. WARNING If the fracture is open, do not attempt to push bones back under the skin. Apply a field dressing to protect the area. a. Splint the broken arm or leg in the position in which you find it. Note. Do not try to reposition or straighten the fracture. b. Place one splint on each side of the arm or leg. Make sure the splints reach beyond the joints above and below the fracture. c. Tie the splints with improvised (or actual) cravats.

(2) Tie nonslip knots on the splint away from the injury. 6. Check the splint for tightness. a. Make sure the cravats are tight enough to hold the splinting materials securely in place. b. Recheck circulation below the injury to make sure circulation is not impaired. c. Make any adjustments without allowing the splint to become ineffective. 7. Apply sling if applicable. Note. A sling can be used to further imm obilize an arm and to provide support by the uninjured side. a. Make a sling from any nonstretching material such as a strip of clothing or blanket, poncho, shelter half, belt, or shirttail. b. Apply the sling so the supporting pressure is on the casualty's uninjured side. c. Make sure the hand of the supported arm is slightly higher than the elbow. 8. Apply swathes if applicable. Note. Apply swathes when the casualty has a splinted, suspected fracture of the elbow or leg, or when a suspected fracture cannot be splinted. (Improvise swathes from large pieces of cloth or belts.) WARNING Place swathes above and/or below the fracture, not over it. a. Apply swathes to an injured arm by wrapping the swathes over the injured arm, around the casualty's back, and under the arm on the uninjured side. Tie the ends on the uninjured side. b.

Detect all liquid chemical agents in the area without becoming a casualty. Identify all liquid chemical agents within the capability of the M8 detector paper. Performance Steps 1. Use the M9 detector paper. Note. M9 and M8 detector paper will not detect chemical agent vapors. a. Attach the M9 detector paper to your MOPP gear and equipment while wearing chemical protective gloves. (1) Place the M9 detector paper on the MOPP gear, on opposite sides of your body. (a) If you are right-handed, place a strip of M9 detector paper around your right upper arm, left wrist, and right ankle. Note. These are the places where a moving soldier will most likely brush against a surface (such as undergrowth) that is c ontaminated with a liquid chemical agent. (b) If you are left-handed, place a strip of M9 detector paper around your left upper arm, right wrist, and left ankle. Note. Do not attach M9 detector paper to hot, dirty, oily, or greasy surfaces because it may give a false positive reading.

Remain in MOPP4 even if the liquid cannot be identified. Use other types of chemical agent detectors to verify test results. f. Notify your supervisor of the test results. Note. M8 detector paper reacts positive to petroleum products, ammonia, and decontaminating solution #2 (DS2). M9 detec tor paper reacts positive to petroleum products, insecticides, and antifreeze. Be cause M9 detector paper only detects but does not identify chemical agents, verify a ll readings with M8 detector paper.

Note. See appendix C in this manual for related skills and knowledge supporting performance of this task. Standards: Moved on foot to designated point s at a rate of 3,000 meters per hour. Performance Steps 1. Determine your pace count. a. When traveling on foot, measure distance by counting paces. The average soldier uses 116 paces to travel 100 meters. Check your pace length by practicing on a known 100-meter distance, like a football field plus one end zone, which is 110 yards (about 100 meters)."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"   071-329-1006     3-225 Performance Steps b. When traveling cross-country as in the field, you use more paces to travel 100 meters, usually about 148 in stead of 116. This is because you are not traveling over level ground, and must use more paces to make up for movement up and down hills. Pace your self over at least 600 meters of crisscrossing terrain to learn how m any paces it takes you to travel an average 100 meters over such terrain. c. Be sure you know how many paces it takes you to walk 100 meters on both level and crisscrossing terrain. (1) The problem in pacing is maintaining a straight line. At night, you will tend to walk in a clockwise circle if you do not use a compass. In daylight, you should use aiming points and a compass. Also, remember to figure only the straight-line distanc e when you have to walk around an obstacle. (2) Another problem is keeping count of paces taken. One way is to use pebbles. For instance, suppose you want to pace off one kilometer. (A kilometer is 1,000 meters or the distance between two of the black grid lines on the map.) Put 10 pebbles in your right pocket. When you go 100 meters, move one pebble to your left pocket an d start your count over. When all 10 pebbles had been moved to your left pocket, you have traveled one kilometer. Or, tie knots in a string, one knot per 100 meters. d. Sample problem: You are to move 715 meters, and your pace count for 100 meters is 116 paces. (1) Using the pebble methods, you will need seven pebbles. This will take you 700 meters. But what about the other 15 meters? (2) To determine how many paces it will take to go the remaining 15 meters, multiply 15 meters by your pace count (116—15 x 116 = 1,740). Mark out the last two numbers (40). The remainder (17) is how many paces it will take to go 15 meters. (3) So you would go 715 meters using the pebble method by pacing off 116 paces per 100 meters until all seven pebbles are used, then go an additional 17 paces to arrive at 715 meters. 2. Navigate from one point to another using terrain association. a. This technique uses terrain or man-made features to serve as landmarks or checkpoints for maintain ing direction of movement. It can be used anywhere, day or night, as long as there are distinguishable terrain features. You use terrain association when moving from the unit area to the motor pool. You walk down the road or sidewalk using intersections or buildings to steer or turn on (landmarks or checkpoints). In the field, with few roads and buildings, use terrain featur es for your axis and checkpoints."},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":" 3-226  071-329-1006    Performance Steps b. In using association, you locate first your position on the map then your destination or objective. It will seldom be the best way to travel. For example, look at figure 071-329-1006-1. Assume that you are to move from point A to point B. You see that a st raight line could cause you to climb several small ridges and valleys (the \"Xs\" on figure 071-329-1006-1). Figure 071-329-1006-1. Straight-line route c. When adjusting your route, consider the following: (1) Tactical aspect. Avoid skylining open areas and danger areas like streams or crossings on roads and hilltops. Your tactical concern is survival. The mission is causing you to move to your objective. You need to be sure you get to that objective. Looking at figure 071-329-1006-2, you decide for tactical reasons to cross the stream where you would not be seen from the road (C) and to cross the road in a small valley (D). You know that valleys offer better cover and concealment, so you will use them (E) (F). "},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"   071-329-1006     3-227 Performance Steps Figure 071-329-1006-2. Adjusted route (2) Ease of movement. Always pi ck the easiest route that the tactical situation allows. However, you achieve surprise by doing the unexpected. A difficult route increases yo ur chance of getting lost. A difficult route may be noisy and may tire you out before you get to your objective. (3) Boundaries. It is almost impossible to travel in a straight line, with or without a compass. Pick an axis or corridor to travel along. Pick boundaries you will be able to spot or feel. Hard-top roads, streams, high grounds, and railroads all make good boundaries. If you start to wander too far off course, you will know it. d. You decide the route shown in figure 071-329-1006-3 offers you easy movement. You check your axis up the valley (1); across the ridge at the saddle (2); cross the stream and tu rn left, keeping the stream on the left and high ground on the right (4); to the third valley (5); to the saddle, then on to the objective (6)."},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":" 3-228  071-329-1006    Performance Steps Figure 071-329-1006-3. Route of travel e. With boundaries to keep you straight, you need to know where, along your corridor, you are. You do this with checkpoints. The best checkpoint is a line or linear featur e that you cannot mi ss. A linear feature across your corridor, or axis, is crossed no matter where you are in the axis. Use hard-top roads, railroads, power lines, perennial streams (solid blue lines, the dash blue lines are frequently dry), rivers, ridges, and valleys. Note. DO NOT use light-duty roads and trails; there are always more on the ground than the map shows. DO NOT use wood lines, which are rarely permanent. f.

Regardless of contour interval, you will spot a contour interval of change on foot. h. Determine the distance between c heckpoints. DISTANCE IS THE CAUSE OF MOST NAVIGATIONAL MIST AKES.

Before moving from the start point, shoot an azimuth on a well- defined object on the ground in the dire ction of travel. These objects, known as steering points, may be lone tr ees, buildings, rocks, or any easily identifiable point. At night, the most likely steering point will be a star. Because of the rotation of the Earth, the positions of t he stars continually change. You must check your azimuth fr equently. Do this only when halted. Using your compass while moving will cause you to go off-course. Your steering mark may be beyond your ob jective. Remember to travel the distance you determined. c. Once you have selected a stee ring point, move toward it, remembering to begin your count. You should have some method devised to keep track of the number of 100 meters you travel. d. Upon reaching your first steering point, shoot an azimuth to another steering mark, and repeat c, unt il you reach the finish point. e. If you should encounter an obstacle, you may have to detour around it (figure 071-329-1006-6). To do this, complete a series of 90-degree turns until the obstacle is bypassed and you are back on the original azimuth. Figure 071-329-1006-6.

(4) Stop and make a note of the number of paces taken, again as in (2) above, add or subtract 90 degrees fr om the azimuth just read, and move to the far side of the obstacle.

(2) Turn until the center of the lu minous letter \"E\" is under the luminous line (do not change the setting of the luminous line). Note. If you turn to the right, \"E\" is under the luminous line. If you turn to the left, \"W\" is under the line. (3) Proceed in the direction until you have outflanked the obstacle. (4) Turn until the north arrow is under the luminous line and proceed parallel to your original course until you have bypassed the obstacle. (5) Turn until the \"W\" is under the luminous line and move back the same distance you originally moved. (6) Finally, turn until the north arrow is under the luminous line and proceed on your original course.

Navigate from one point to another by combining terrain association with dead reckoning."},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"   071-329-1006     3-233 Performance Steps a. Frequently, you must consider the advantage and disadvantage of both navigation techniques. (1) Terrain association is fast and easy, and allows for mistakes. It is also subject to map accuracy and can only be used with recognizable terrain features. (2) Dead reckoning is accu rate and works on flat terrain that lacks terrain features; however, all work must be precise, and the technique takes time. b. There may be times when you combine both techniques. For instance, in the desert, you may need to use dead reckoning to arrive at or near a road, or a ridge, and then use terrain association to follow that feature to an objective. Evaluation Preparation: Setup : Select an area with varying terrain and vegetation and large enough to have two points, 1,000 meters to 2,000 meters apart. Ensure each point is on or near an identifiable terrain f eature and marked on the ground with a sign containing a letter or number. Place dummy signs not less than 100 meters but not more than 200 meters to the right and left of the correct point. Clearly mark correct points on the map. Prepare a sheet of paper giving the azimuth and distance for each leg of the course to be covered. Have pencils available for the tested soldier. Brief Soldier: 1. Terrain Association. a. Give the soldier the map and tell him to identify the best route to take between the two points plotted on the map (1,000 meters to 2,000 meters apart). Note. The best route must have been determined by an SME before the test. b. Give the soldier the map and tell him he must move from point A to point B (1,000 meters to 2,000 meters apart) using terrain association (no compass is used). Tell the soldier he has _______ (standard in minutes and/or hours) to complete the course. 2. Dead Reckoning. Give the soldier t he sheet of paper with the azimuth and the distance for each leg of the course (three to five points, 200 meters to 500 meters apart), and the compass; no map will be used. Tell the soldier to move over the course shown by th e azimuth and the di stance on the paper. Tell the soldier to record the letter or number at the end of each leg of the course. Tell the soldier he has ______ (standard in minutes and/or hours) to complete the course."},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":" 3-234  071-329-1030    Note: Time standards are based on the average time it takes two SMEs to complete the course plus 50 percent. For example, if the SME time is one hour, course test time is one hour and 30 minutes. SME time (1 hour) + 50 percent (30 minutes) = course test time of one hour and 30 minutes. Tell the soldier he has 10 minutes to study the map and determine a course of action. At the end of this time, he wi ll move to the start point and begin the test.

Standards: Directed the driver to the designa ted point(s) at a rate of nine kilometers per hour using terrain association and dead reckoning. Performance Steps 1. Determine the effects of terrain on the vehicle when navigating mounted. a. Vehicle speed and mobility. (1) Great distances may be covered quickly. Develop the ability to estimate the distance traveled. Meanwhile, use the odometer, which shows the distance traveled. Reme mber that .1 mile is roughly 160 meters, and 1 mile is about 1,600 meters or 1.6 kilometers. (2) Mobility is an advantage whil e navigating. When disoriented, mobility makes it easier to move and reorient. b. Vehicle capabilities. (1) Most military vehicles can knock down a tree. Larger vehicles can clear more trees but cannot knock down several trees at once. Find paths between trees that are wide eno ugh for the vehicle (figure 071-329- 1030-1). Figure 071-329-1030-1. Vehicle capabilities"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":" 3-236  071-329-1030    Performance Steps CAUTION During training, follow installation SOP or local guidelines concerning cross- country vehicle travel. (2) Military vehicles are designed to climb 60-percent (30-degree) slopes if the surface is dry and firm. If gravel, vegetation, or mud is on the slope, the practical slope-climbing capability is about 40 percent (20 degrees) (figure 071-329-1030-2). Figure 071-329-1030-2. Climbing slope and side slope capabilities (a) Determine the approximate slope by looking at the route selected on a map. One contour line in any 100 meters of map distance on that route indicates a 10-percent slop e. Two contour lines indicate a 20- percent slope, and so forth. If there are four contour lines in 100 meters, look for another route. Note. The above figures are true for a 10-mete r or 20-foot contour interval. If the map has a different contour interval, adjust the arithmetic. For instance, if there is one contour line in 100 meters, a 10-meter in terval would give a 10-percent slope. (b) The side slope is more important than the climbing slope. A 40-percent side slope is the maximu m in good weather (figure 071-329- 1030-2). Traverse a side slope slowly and without turning. Rocks, stumps, or sharp turns can cause a downhill track to be thrown under the vehicle, which is a major recovery task. (3) For tactical reasons, movement is often in draws or valleys due to the cover they provide. Side sl opes make slow movement necessary. 2. Know the effects of weather on vehicle movement. a. Weather can halt mounted movement. Snow and ice are dangerous. Rain and snow affect soil load-bearing ability. Heavy rain may restrict cross-country vehicles to road movement. b. Adjust the route to avoid flooded or muddy areas. A stuck vehicle hinders combat capability."},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"   071-329-1030     3-237 Performance Steps 3. Know both methods of navigation. a. Terrain association. This is t he most used method of navigation. The navigator plans the route for mo vement from one terrain feature to another. An automobile driver uses t he same technique while driving along the streets in a city. He guides himself using intersections or other landmarks. Like a driver, the navigator selects routes, or \"streets,\" between key points, or \"intersections.\" These r outes must sustain vehicle travel, and should be as direct and easy to follow as possible. In a typical move, the navigator determines his location and the location of his objective. He notes the position of each on his map a nd selects a route between the two. (1) Determine the start point and destination. (2) Draw or visualize a straight line between the two points on the map. (3) Inspect the terrain along that line for ease of movement, for features recognizable under predict ed weather conditions, and for tactical considerations. (4) After analyzing the terrain, adjust the route by doing the following: (a) Consider tactical aspects. Avoid skylining, select key terrain for overwatch positions, and select concealed routes. (b) Consider ease of movement. Use the easiest possible route. Bypass difficult terra in. A difficult route is hard to follow, noisier, causes more wear to the vehicle (and possibly recovery problems), and takes more time. Tactical surprise is achieved by doing the unexpected. Try to select an axis or corridor and not a specific route. Allow room for vehicles to maneuver. (c) Use terrain features as checkpoints. Checkpoints must be easily recognizable, from a moving v ehicle, under the current light and weather conditions. The best checkpoint s are linear features that cross the route. Use perennial streams, rivers , hardtop roads, ridges, valleys, and railroads. The next best are elevati on changes; hills, depressions, spurs, and draws. Look for two contour lines of change. Less than two lines of change cannot be spotted while mounted. (d) Follow terrain features. Movement and navigation along a valley floor or near or on the crest of a ridgeline are easiest."},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":" 3-238  071-329-1030    Performance Steps (e) Determine directions. Break the route into smaller segments and determine the rough dire ction that will be followed. The compass is not needed; use the main points of direction (north, northeast, east, for example). Before moving, not e the location of the sun and the direction of north. Locate changes of di rection, if any, at the checkpoints chosen. (f) Determine distance. Obtain the total distance to be traveled and the approximate distance between checkpoints. Plan to use the vehicle odometer to keep tr ack of distance traveled. Note. Convert map distance to ground dist ance by adding 20 percent for cross- country movement. (g) Make notes. Usually, mental notes are adequate. Imagine what the route will be like and remember it. (h) Plan. Restudy the route selected. Determine where problems may occur and how they may be avoided. b. Dead reckoning. Dead reckoning means moving a set distance along a set line. It involves moving so many meters along a set line, usually an azimuth in degrees. Note. There is no accurate method of det ermining direction in vehicles. (1) Dead reckoning with steering marks. This procedure is the same as it is for on foot travel. (a) Dismount from the vehicle. (b) Move away from the vehicle (about 50 meters). (c) Set the azimuth on the compass and choose a steering mark (rock, tree, hilltop) in the distance on that azimuth. (d) Remount and have the driver identify the steering mark. Proceed to it in as straight a line as possible. (e) On arrival at the steering mark or when direction is changed, repeat paragraphs (a) throug h (c) for the next leg of travel. (2) Dead reckoning without steering marks. Use this only in flat, featureless terrain. (a) Dismount from the vehicle, which has been positioned in the direction of travel. Move about 50 meters to the front of the vehicle. (b) Face the vehicle and read the azimuth to the vehicle. (c) By adding or subtracting 180 degrees, determine the forward azimuth (direction of travel). (d) Have the driver drive on a straight line toward you."},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"   071-329-1030     3-239 Performance Steps (e) Remount the vehicle, hold the compass as it will be held while the vehicle is moving, and read the azimuth to the front. (f) The compass swings off the azimuth determined, but it should pick up a constant deviation. For instance, the azimuth to the steering mark was 75 degrees while you were away from the vehicle. When you remounted, and the driver drov e straight forward, the compass showed 67 degrees. There is a deviation of minus 8 degrees. All that is needed is to hold the 67-degree heading. (g) At night, do the same thing without a steering mark. From the map, determine the azimuth of tr avel. Line the vehicle up on that azimuth, then move well in front of the vehicle. Be sure it is aligned correctly. Mount, have the driver move slowly forward, and note the deviation. Note. If the vehicle has a turret, traversi ng the turret changes the deviation. (3) Turret alignment. If the vehicle has a stabilized turret, another method is alignment of the turret on t he azimuth to be traveled. Switch the turret stabilization system ON. The gun tube remains pointed at the destination no matter which way the vehicle is turned. CAUTION If you have to take the turret off-line to engage a target, repeat the entire process. Note. This technique works, and it is not harmful to the stabilization system. However, the vehicle is subject to stabilizat ion drift; therefore, use this technique for no more than 5,000 meters before resetting. (4) Distance factor. Computing t he distance factor in dead reckoning is usually a simple process. Determine the map distance to travel and add 20 percent to convert to ground distance. Use the vehicle odometer to control the distance of travel. 4. Learn to combine and use both methods. a. Terrain association is fast and e rror-tolerant. It is the best method under most circumstances, and it can be used day or night. b. Dead reckoning is accurate if done correctly—precision is a requirement. Dead reckoning is slow, but works in flat terrain. c. Often, dead reckoning and terrain association are combined. Use dead reckoning to travel across a large, flat area to a ridge. Use terrain association for the rest of the move. d. The ability to use both methods is required. Probable errors, in order of frequency, are as follows: (1) Failure to determine distance(s) to be traveled."},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":" 3-240  071-329-1030    Performance Steps (2) Failure to travel the proper distance.

Compare observed vehicle characteristics with known vehicle attributes. Four areas of characteristics are used to identify vehicles. Most armored vehicles have all four areas of characteristics, though not all vehicles do. a. Track and suspension system: Many tanks can be recognized by their track and suspension systems. However, recognizing a vehicle by this feature alone is often difficult. Grass, dirt, terrain, dust or other factors often obscure the tracks. To identify the track and suspension system, check to see whether it has support or return ro llers. Few threat vehicles, except the T-10, T-64, T-72, BMD, BMP, SP-122, and SP-152, have either."},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"   071-730-0014     3-255 Performance Steps (1) Characteristics of most Warsaw Pact vehicles include a flat (Christie) suspension system, without support or return rollers, without torsion bars, and unevenly spaced road wheels.

Standards: Detected and determined range to targets. Fired the M16-series rifle to engage targets in the assign ed sector of fire. Applied correct marksmanship fundamentals and target engagement techniques so each target was hit or suppressed. Performance Steps 1. Place TWS into operation. 2. Assume an appropriate firing position based on the situation. The firing position should protect you from enemy fire and observation, yet allow you to place effective fire on tar gets in your sector of fire. a. Foxhole. Advantages: best w hen available. Disadvantages: no overhead cover. b. Prone. Advantages: steady, easy to assume, low silhouette, and easily adapted to use of cover and support. Disadvantages: effectiveness can be limited by terrain a nd vegetation irregularities. c. Prone supported. Advantages: steadier than prone, other advantages the same as prone. Disadvantages: same as prone. d. Kneeling. Advantages: used when firing from behind something, used on ground that is level or gently sloping upward. Disadvantage: exposed to small arms fire. e. Kneeling supported. Advantages: steadier than kneeling; other advantages the same as kneeling. Disadvantages: exposure to small arms fire. f. Standing. Advantages: used in assault to surprise targets or when other positions are not appropriate . Disadvantages: Unstable and allows more exposure to small arms fire. 3.

Use the small dots shown in a horizontal row to the right of the reticle center as aiming points for M16- series rifles. a. Personnel: Place the target on the horizontal line and match its height with one of the vertical li nes. Measurement is made from the horizontal line to the top (or bottom) of each vertical line for the range indicated. b. Tank: When viewed from the side, place the left edge of tank at the left side of the horizontal line. Read the range to the tank from the scale at the right edge of the tank. When viewed from front or rear, use one half the indicated range value (because width of the tank is approximately half the length of the tank). 6. Fire on target(s) until they are destroy ed or until you receive an order to cease fire. Evaluation Preparation: Setup : Evaluate this task on a live-fire range. Provide the soldier with the equipment and materials in task conditions. Brief Soldier: Brief the soldier on range safety according to installation SOP.

Based on the situation, assume the position that allows you to observe and engage targets yet minimize your exposure to enemy fire. a. Tripod firing. A number of firing positions can be used based on situation (prone, sitting, or kneeling; or standing if firing from prepared position). b. Bipod firing. Prone supported posit ion and bipod-supported fighting position are the best for delivering effe ctive fire on targets. Assume these positions when possible. (1) Shoulder firing position. Use th is position to engage specific targets during movement when you c an assume no other position or the situation dictates its use, such as the final stages of an assault. (2) Underarm firing position. Use this position when closing with the enemy, when a heavy volume of fire in the target area is required, and when rapid movement is necessary. (3) Hip firing position. Use this position when a heavy volume of fire in the target area is required and rapid movement is not necessary. 2. Identify targets in your des ignated sector of fire. 3.

Standards: Implemented OPSEC measures based on unit indicators and vulnerabilities; protected unit ess ential elements of friendly information against threat collection efforts and prevented compromise. Performance Steps 1. Define OPSEC. a. OPSEC is a process of analyzi ng friendly actions pursuant to military operations and other activities to— (1) Identify those friendly action s that can be observed by the threat. (2) Determine indicators that the th reat might obtain that could be interpreted or pieced together to deriv e critical information in time to be useful."},{"pageNumber":636,"pageContent":" 3-596  301-371-1050    Performance Steps (3) Select and execute measures t hat eliminate or reduce to an acceptable level the vulnerabilities of friendly actions to the threat exploitation. b. OPSEC maintains essential secrecy, which is the condition achieved by the denial of critical in formation to the threat. Threat possession of critical information can prevent friendly mission accomplishment. Thus, essential secrecy is a necessary prerequisite for effective operations. Essential secr ecy depends on the combination of two conditions: (1) Provide traditional security programs that deny the threat classified information. (2) Provide OPSEC to deny the threat critical information, which is always sensitive and often unclassified. 2. Define indicators. a. Indicators are data derived from open sources or from detectable actions that the threat can piece toget her or interpret to reach conclusions or official estimates concerning friendly intentions, capabilities, or activities. They are also activities that result from military operations. Indicators contribute to the determination of friendly courses of action. Their identification and interpretation are cr itical tasks of the threat operations. Indicators can be used in many ways. For example, if the commander wants the threat to think one way but, in reality plans on doing something entirely different, he may give him a false indicator (such as massing a smaller force to disguise a larger objective). b. There are three types of indicators: (1) Profile indicators show how activities are normally conducted. Profiles are developed by looking at all aspects of friendly operations from the viewpoint of the threat. The friend ly profile must include all of those things that, if detected by the thr eat, could provide information concerning our capabilities, vulnerabilities, and intentions. (a) Patterns are stereotyped actions that occur so habitually that they can cue an observer to either the type of military unit or activity, its identity, capabilities, or intent. T he Army tends to do things in the same way (SOP). This causes patterns that the threat looks for so he can predict intentions. (b) Signatures result from the pres ence of a unit or activity on the battlefield. Signatures are det ected because different units have different types of equipment, are of diffe rent sizes, emit different electronic signals, and have different noises associated with them."},{"pageNumber":637,"pageContent":"   301-371-1050     3-597 Performance Steps (2) Deviation indicators, which highlight contrasts to normal activity, help the threat gain appreciation about intentions, preparations, time, and place. (3) Tip-off indicators draw attention to information that otherwise might pass unnoticed. These are most significant when they warn the threat of impending activity. This warning allows the threat to pay closer attention and to task additional collection assets. 3. Identify threat capabilities. a. The threat consists of multiple and overlapping collection efforts targeted against all sources of Army information. The threat devotes significant resources to monitor U.S. military operations and activities on a daily basis. The threat can produce reli able information on the U.S. military and its capabilities, intentions, and vul nerabilities. The threat is also shifting the emphasis in targeting. Foreign targeting of American technology is increasing for economic as well as military reasons. Technology transfer will continue to remain a major concern in the future. b. The major threat collection capabilities fall in four areas: (1) Human intelligence (HUMINT) includes all information derived through human sources not accessible to other collection assets. HUMINT employs overt, covert, and clandestine operations to achieve worldwide collection objectives. (2) Imagery intelligence (IMINT). T he threat can obtain IMINT from land, sea, air, and space platforms (radar, photographic, infrared, and electro-optic imagery). At the tactical level, airborne collection possesses the greatest IMINT threat. (3) Signals intelligence (SIGINT) re sults from the collection, evaluation, analysis, int egration, and interpretation of information derived from intercepted electromagnetic emissions. (4) Measurement and signature intelli gence (MASINT) is scientific and technical intelligence obtained by quantitative and qualitative analysis of data derived from technical sensor s for the purpose of identifying any distinctive features associated with t he source, emitter, or sender and to facilitate subsequent identification or measurement. c. Two additional areas of concern: (1) Technology transfer, which has led to significant enhancement of military-industrial capabilities at the expense of the United States. (2) Non-traditional threats. Past and present allies are potential intelligence threats. They can engage in intelligence collection activities to gain economic or political advantage, wh ich is not in the best interest of the United States."},{"pageNumber":638,"pageContent":" 3-598  301-371-1050    Performance Steps 4. Define OPSEC measures. OPSEC measures are methods and means to gain and maintain essential secrecy about critical information. a. Action control eliminates indicators. Select what action to undertake, decide whether or not to execute actions, or impose restraints on actions. (Specify who, when, where, and how.) b. Countermeasures attack the threat collection system by using— (1) Diversions. (2) Camouflage. (3) Concealment. (4) Jamming. (5) Deception. 5. Implement the OPSEC Process. O PSEC has five steps that apply to any plan, operation, program, project, or activity. They provide a framework for the systematic proce ss necessary to identify, analyze, and protect information for essential secrecy. The process is continuous. It considers the changing nature of t he threat and friendly vulnerabilities throughout the operation. It uses the following steps, but does not have to follow them in a particular sequence. a. Identify critical information. Critic al information consists of specific facts about friendly intenti ons, capabilities, and activities vitally needed by the threat to plan effectively and to guarantee failure or unacceptable consequences for friendly mission accomplishment. (1) Determine what needs protection. (2) Identify key questions that threat officials are likely to ask about friendly intentions, capabilities, and activities, so they can obtain answers critical to their operational effectivene ss. To determine sensitive aspects of our operations, ask “If known by the threat, what information and what actions could compromise friendly operations or identify us?” (3) Identify friendly force profile. The G3 and the G2 are responsible for developing friendly force profiles. (4) Avoid setting patterns. b. Conduct an analysis of threats. (1) Identify OPSEC vulnerabilities. It is absolutely necessary that you know the threat. This informa tion will assist in determining vulnerabilities to the threat and it will become even more important when the time comes to implement count ermeasures or deception measures."},{"pageNumber":639,"pageContent":"   301-371-1050     3-599 Performance Steps (2) Examine each part of the operation to find OPSEC indicators. Compare those indicators with the threat collection capabilities. A vulnerability exists when the threat can collect an indicator, correctly analyze the information, make a decision, and take timely action to degrade friendly operations. c. Conduct an analysis of vulnerabilities. (1) Identify possible OPSEC measures for each vulnerability. (2) Select at least one OPSEC measure for each vulnerability. (3) Assess the sufficiency of routine security measures (personnel, physical, cryptographic, document, special access, and automated information systems). This will provide OPSEC measures for some vulnerabilities. d. Perform risk assessment. The purpose of this step is to select OPSEC measures for implementation. This step is designed to determine if a risk to an operation's success exists should the threat detect friendly indicators, patterns, or signatures. Only the commander responsible for the mission can make this decision. He must balance the risk of operational failure against the cost of OPSEC measures. (1) Consider the impact of an O PSEC measure on operational efficiency. (2) Consider the probable risk to mission success (effectiveness) if the unit does not implement an OPSEC measure. (3) Consider the probable risk to mission success if an OPSEC measure does not work. (4) Decide which, if any, OPSEC measures to implement and when to do so. (5) Check the interaction of OPSEC measures. Ensure that a measure to protect a specific piece of critical information does not unwittingly provide an indicator of another. (6) Coordinate OPSEC measures with the other elements of C2W. e. Apply appropriate countermeasures to deny threat information of specific friendly intentions , capabilities, and activities. (1) Implement measures that require immediate action. This applies to current operations as well as planning and preparation for future ones. (2) Document or task OPSEC measures by using an OPSEC annex to the OPLAN/OPORD."},{"pageNumber":640,"pageContent":" 3-600  301-371-1050    Performance Steps (3) Brief OPSEC requirements to planners, participants, and support personnel. Note. OPSEC measures are command-direct ed actions executed by individuals, who must be aware of their responsibilities. (4) Monitor OPSEC measures during execution. Monitoring is a continuous process of evaluating intelligence and counterintelligence. It is necessary to monitor countermeasures for effectiveness because unevaluated countermeasures can lead to a false and dangerous sense of security. (5) Make adjustments to improve the effectiveness of existing measures. These adjustments are nec essary to obtain the best protection for our military operations. 6. Define OPSEC review, assessment, and survey. a. OPSEC review is an evaluation of a document to ensure protection of sensitive or critical information. b. OPSEC assessment is an analys is of an operation, activity, exercise, or support function to determine the overall OPSEC posture and to evaluate the degree of compliance of subordinate organizations with the published OPSEC plan or OPSEC program. c. OPSEC survey is a method to determine if there is adequate protection of critical information dur ing planning, preparations, execution, and post-execution phases of any operation or activity. It analyzes all associated functions to identify source s of information, what they disclose, and what can be derived from the information.

Because a moving unit usually contac ts the enemy at a time and place of the enemy's choosing, you must use te rrain to your best advantage. Proper use of terrain has two advantages: (1) Cover and concealment to protect the platoon during movement. (2) Maximum effectiveness of the platoon's weapons. b. To properly use those advantages , you must understand the military aspects of terrain and be able to apply them to any given situation, whether it be a defense, a delay, or a road march behind the forward edge of the battle area (FEBA). c.

You must take advantage of every ravine or depression in the ground to protect and cover your force, especially if you are forward of the FEBA. You must eval uate the terrain, the abilities of the enemy's weapons systems, and the positi on of known or suspected enemy emplacement. Visualize a cross section of the terrain and determine where the enemy cannot place effective dire ct fire on your proposed route. (2) Concealment is anything that hides or disguises your force. You must consider concealment from bot h air and ground observation. If you are mechanized, exhaust smoke or dust can reveal your unit to the enemy. d. If you are moving in an area where contact with the enemy is expected, you must ensure that your proposed route can be covered by fire from your overwatch or fire support positions. Those positions must have good observation and fields of fire. (1) Direct fire weapons must have good observation to fire known or suspected enemy positions along y our movement route. You must have observation to control the maneuver of your elements, if they make contact. Consider the effects of sm oke and dust from friendly and enemy fire. (2) Select a route that gives your unit the best field of fire. Your machine guns and antitank weapons must have good fields of fire to be effective. They must be in a posi tion to provide suppressive fires immediately. The crew-served weapons to overwatching your movement must be able to observe your route and fire in your support all the way to the objective. The overwatch positi ons that you select must have unobstructed fields of fire to the next overwatch position."},{"pageNumber":649,"pageContent":" C-3 Performance Steps 2. Select the route that provides the most favorable tactical advantage and meets the mission requirements. If enemy air is active or enemy ground forces are in the area of t he route, you must take maximum advantage of cover and concealment. If speed of movement is critical, the route should be over the most easily negotiable terrain, avoiding difficult obstacles. The route should include movement from one easily distinguishable terrain feature to anot her. When ordered to move, you must check the terrain based on the above considerations and select the quickest and safest route. 3. Planning a route can be aided by the use of special purpose maps and aerial photographs. If those aids are ava ilable, use them to ensure that you have the most current information. 4. Map reconnaissance, however, is no substitute for ground reconnaissance. If time is available and the tactical situation permits, reconnoiter the route that you have to move over.

Standards: Determined the six-digit grid coordinates for the point on the map with a 100-meter tolerance. Recorded the grid coordinates with the correct two-letter 100,000-meter-square identifier. Performance Steps Note. 1. A military map can help you spot your location accurately. The map has vertical lines (top to bottom) and horizontal lines (left to right). These lines form small squares 1,000 meters on each side, called grid squares. 2. The lines that form grid squares are numbered along the outside edge of the map picture. No two grid squares have the same number. 3. The precision of a point location is shown by the number of digits in the coordinates; the more digits, the more precise the location. For example: 1996—A 1,000-meter grid square. 192961—To the nearest 100 meters."},{"pageNumber":662,"pageContent":" C-16 Performance Steps 1. Look at figure C-11. Your address is grid square 1181.

To make your addre ss more accurate, just add another number to the first half and another number to the other half so your address has six numbers instead of four. a. To get these extra numbers, supp ose that each grid square has 10 lines inside it running north and s outh, and another 10 running east and west. This makes 100 smaller squares.

You do not have to use imaginary lines because you can come up with the exact coordinates. This scale is on the coor dinate scale and protractor (GTA 05- 02-012) (figure C-13) or the plotting scale (figure C-14).

Standards: Determined the grid azimuth (in mils or degrees) from your location (point A) to point B to within 1 degree or 20 mils. Performance Steps 1. The direction from one point to another, either on the map or on the ground, is called an azimuth. Azimuths are given in degrees or mils in a clockwise direction from north, and all azimuths taken from a map are grid azimuths. a. An azimuth in degrees can be an y number up to 360, as there are 360 degrees in a circle. Due east is 90 degrees, due south is 180 degrees, due west is 270 degrees, and due north is 360 degrees or 0 degrees. b. An azimuth in mils can be an y number up to 6400, as there are 6400 mils in circle. Due east is 1600 mils, due south is 3200 mils, due west is 4800 mils, and due north is 6400 mils or 0 mils. 2. The most accurate way to determi ne an azimuth from a map is to use a protractor. There are two types of prot ractors in use in the Army today. a. The square protractor (GTA 05-02-012), which has a degree scale and a mil scale. The inner scale is the degree scale, and the outer scale is the mil scale. b. The semicircular protractor, wh ich may or may not have two scales: an outer scale in mils and an inner scale in degrees. The mil and degree scales consist of two rows of numbers. In each of the scales, the outer row of numbers is used when determining azim uths to the east of your position, and the inner row of numbers is used when determining azimuths to the west of your position. 3. Use the protractor properly. a. Plot the location of two points on the map. b. Using a straightedge, draw a strai ght line (azimuth line) from point A to point B. Note. The line drawn between the two points must be long enough to cross the scale(s) of the protractor in order to read the azimuth. Should the line between the two points be too short to cross the scale(s), extend the line beyond point B until it crosses the scale(s)."},{"pageNumber":706,"pageContent":" C-60 Performance Steps c. Place the index of the protractor at the point wh ere the azimuths line crosses one of the vertical (nor th-south) grid lines. This procedure allows greater accuracy in aligning the index line to a true reading where the azimuth line crosses the protractor scale. Note. Ensure that the 0-degrees or 0-mils mark on the protractor is toward the top (north) of the map. d. Start at the 0-degree or 0-mil ma rk on the protractor and read to the right (clockwise) until you reach the point where the azimuth line crosses the scale(s) of the protractor. Note. When using the protractor, each tick mark on the degree scale is 1 degree, while each tick mark on the mil scale is 20 mils. e. Read the azimuth where the az imuth line crosses the scale(s).

More than 180 degrees, subtract 180 degrees. —Mils: Less than 3200 mils, add 3200 mils. More than 3200 mils, subtract 3200 mils. Evaluation Preparation: Setup : Provide the soldier with azimuths, one in degrees and one in mils. Brief Soldier : Tell the soldier to compute the exact back azimuths. Performance Measures GO NO GO 1. Computed the exact back azimuth. —— —— Evaluation Guidance: Score the soldier GO if the performance measure is passed. Score the soldier NO GO if t he performance measure is failed. If the soldier scores NO GO, show what was done wrong and how to do it correctly.
