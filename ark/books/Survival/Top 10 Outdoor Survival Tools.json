Here are the supplie s that we think belong in a small pack for quick trips int o the wilderness. Of course, a GPS unit and a satel lite phone would be handy, but this collection is meant to be a cheap backup for times when those items are damaged or inaccessible. 10. High-Calorie Protein Bars Hunting and fishing may be more trouble than they a re worth. You may burn more calories in search of prey than you would gain from eating their flesh. S ave yourself from some agony by packing a few snack s. 9. Flashlight Flashlights can be seen by search and rescue teams from a great distance. They are a great way to attr act attention to yourself and could come in handy if yo u have trouble making a fire. 8. Whistle When you are lost in the woods, signaling for help should be a high priority. Blowing a whistle period ically requires much less energy than yelling and the high pitch sound may travel further. 7. Backpacker Hammock In extremely hot or cold environments, protecting y ourself from the elements is half the battle. You c an always disassemble it to construct a more elaborate shelter.

Water Purification Supplies Drinking brackish water can do more harm than good. By properly filtering and decontaminating your beverages, you can avoid getting in even more troub le. 5. Plastic Trash Bag Thin and light, they are worth their weight in gold and have a plethora of uses. Use them to catch rai n, cut three holes to improvise a rain poncho, or windproo f your shelter. Bring several of them. Trash compac tor bags are the sturdiest. 4. First-Aid Kit Medical emergencies are an even bigger deal than be ing lost. Your kit should contain items to deal wit h serious injuries -- not just cuts and scrapes. Pack some Quick Clot or Celox to deal with serious blee ding, tweezers, a needle and thread, antibiotic cream, a bit of sunblock, and any special medications that y ou may need. 3. Metal Cup or Can Staying hydrated is far more important than finding food. With a metal container, you have the option of boiling the water to kill nasty microbes. 2. Butane Lighter and Tinder Starting fires with a mischmetal flint in a dry climate is easy, but in wet weather, you may need a cigarette lighter and some flammable helpers to get your fire going. Cotton balls covered in wax, solid backpack ing stove tablets, or a flask of Bacardi 151 are all vi able options. 1. Knife Never leave home without one. A sturdy blade is ess ential for building shelters, preparing food, makin g campfires and countless other tasks. Honorable Mention Do you disagree with us? Now is your chance to spea k up.
