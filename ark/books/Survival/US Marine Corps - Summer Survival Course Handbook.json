Whil e many of these signs may not be self-identified, it remains cr itical that all survi vors r emain attentive to each other's signs of distress. L isted are a few com mon signs of distress found when faced with too much stress: 01- 3 MSVX.02.01"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"a. Diffic ulty in makin g decisions.

Thou ghts about death or suicide. h. Trouble getting along with ot hers. i. Withdrawin g from others. j. Hidin g from responsibiliti es. k. Carelessness. 3. SURV IVAL STRE SSOR S . (MSVX .02.01b ). Any event can lead to s tress. O ften, st ressful events occur simultaneous ly. These events ar e not st ress, but t hey produce it and are called \"stressors\". In response to a stresso r, the bod y prepares to ei ther \"fight or flight\". Stresso rs add up. A nticipating stressors an d developing strategies to c ope with them are the two ingredients in the effective manag ement of stress. I t is essential tha t the survivor be aware of the types of stressors they will en counter. a. Injury, Illness, or Death . Injury, illness, and death are real pos sibiliti es a survivor may face. Perhaps nothin g is more stressful th an bein g alone in an unfamiliar environme nt whe re you could die from hosti le action, a n accident, o r from eating something lethal. b. Uncertainty and Lack of Control . So me people have troubl e operating in se ttings where everything is not c lear-cut. This unc ertainty and lack of c ontrol also add t o the stress of b eing ill, inju red or killed. c. Envir onment . A survivor will have to c ontend wi th the stressors of weather, terrain and the types of creatures inhabiting an area. Envi ronmental and climac tic changes, coupl ed with insects and ani mals, are just a few of th e challenges awaiting the Marine working to su rvive. d. Hung er and Thi rst . Withou t food a nd water a person w ill weaken and eventually die. Getting and preserving food a nd wat er take on in creasing import ance as the length of 01- 4 MSVX.02.01"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"time in a survival situation inc reases. With the likelihood of diarrhea, replenishing electrolytes becomes critical. Fo r a Marine used to having his pr ovisions issued, foraging can be a significant sour ce of stress. e. Fatigue . It is essential that survivo rs em ploy all available means to p reserve mental and ph ysical strength. W hile food, w ater and oth er energy build ers may be in shor t supply, maxi mizing sleep to a void d eprivation is a v ery controllable factor. Further, sleep deprivation di rectly correlates with increased fear. f. Isolation . Being in contact with oth ers provid es a greater sense of se curity and a feeling someone is a vailable to h elp if problems occur. 4. NATURA L REA CTIONS . Man has been able to survive man y changes in his envi ronme nt throughout th e centuries. His ability to ad apt ph ysically and me ntally to a c hanging world keeps him alive. The average person will ha ve some psychological reactions in a s urvival situation. The se are some of th e major int ernal reactions you might exper ience within a survival situation: a. Fear . Fear is our emotional r esponse to d angerous situ ations that w e believe have the potential to c ause death, injur y or illness. Fear can have a positi ve effect if it fo rces us to be cautious in situ ations wh ere recklessness could r esult in inju ry. b. Anxiet y . Anxiet y is an uneasy, apprehensiv e feeling we get when faced with dangerous situations. A survivor reduces his anxiety by performing those tasks th at will e nsure his c oming th rough the ordeal alive. c. Anger and Frustration . Frustration a rises when a person is c ontinually thwarted in his attempts to reach a goal. One result of fru stration is anger. Getting lost, damaging or forgetting equipment, weather, inhospi table terrain, e nemy patrols a nd ph ysical limitations are just a f ew sour ces of frustration a nd an ger. Frustration a nd an ger encourage impuls ive reactions, irrational b ehavior, poo rly thou ght-out decisions, and in som e instances, an \" I quit\" attitud e. d. Depression . Depression is closely linked with frustration a nd anger when f aced wit h the privations of su rvival. A destructive cycle between anger and frustration c ontinues until the person be comes worn down -physically, emotionall y and me ntally. At this point, h e starts to give up, and hi s focus shifts from \"What can I do\" to \"There is nothin g I can do. \" e. Loneliness and Bo redom . Man is a social animal and enjoys the company of others. Loneliness and bo redom can be another source of depression. M arines must find ways to keep their minds product ively occupied. f. Guilt . The circumstances leading to your survival situation a re sometimes dramatic and tragic. It may be the result of an accident or military action wh ere there was a loss of life. Per haps you were the only, or one of a f ew, su rvivo rs.

Each survival situation will have unique aspects that alter the order in which tasks ne ed to b e accomplished. A general guideline is to think in blo cks of time. a. First 24 hou rs. The first 24 hour s are critical in a survival situa tion. You must make an initial estimate of the situation. Enem y, weather, terrain, time of day and av ailable resources will determine whi ch tasks n eed to be accomplished first. Th ey should be the following: (1) Shelt er. (2) Fire. (3) Water . (4) Signaling. b. Second 24 hou rs. After the first 24 hou rs have passed, you will now know if y ou can survive. This time period ne eds to b e spent on expa nding your know ledge of the area. By completing the followin g tasks, y ou will be able to gain valuable know ledge. (1) Tools and we apons . By traveling a short distance from your shelter to locate the necessary resources, you will noti ce edible food s ources and g ame trails. (2) Traps an d sna res . Moving further away from your shelter to emplo y traps and snares, y ou will be able to loc ate your shelter area from various va ntage points. Thi s will enable you to identify likely avenues of approach into your shelter area. (3) Pathguards . Knowin g the likely avenues of ap proaches, you can effectively place noise and ca sualty producin g pathguards to e nsure the security of your shelter area. c. Remainde r of your survival situ ation. This time is sp ent on c ontinuous ly improvi ng your survival situa tion until y our rescue. 6. GROUP SURVIVAL. Group su rvival depends l argely on th e ability to organize a ctivity. An emergency situation doe s not bring people together for a common goal initia lly; rather, the more diff icult an d confusin g the situation, th e greater are the group’s problems. a. Groups Morale . High moral e must come from internal cohesiveness and not merely through exte rnal pressure. The moods and attitudes can become wildl y contagious. 01- 6 MSVX.02.01"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Conscious, we ll-planned organization an d leadership on th e basis of delegated or shared responsibil ity often ca n prevent panic. High group moral e has many advantages. (1) An individu al feels strengthened and p rotected sinc e he realizes that hi s survival may depend on o thers whom he trusts. (2) The group can meet failure with greater persistency. (3) The group can formulat e goals to help each other face the futu re. b. Factors that Influence Group Surviv al . There are numerous f actors that will influ ence wheth er a group ca n successfully survive. (1) Organization of Manpowe r - Organized action is important to keep all members of the group info rmed; this wa y the members of the group will know what t o do an d whe n to do it, both under ordinary circumstances and in emergencies. (2) Selective Use of Personnel - In well-organized g roups, th e person o ften does the job th at mos t closely fits his pe rsonal qualifications. (3) Acceptance of Suggestion and C riticisms - The senior man must accept respons ibility for the final decision, but must be able to take suggestion a nd criticisms from others. (4) Consideration of Time - On-the-spot d ecisions th at must be acted upon immediatel y usually determine su rvival success. (5) Check Equipme nt - Failure to check equipment can result in failure to survive. (6) Survival K nowledge and Skil ls - C onfidence in one 's abil ity is increased by acquiring survival know ledge and s kills. REFERENCE: 1. FM 21-76, Survival, 1992. 2.

In areas with moder ate to h eavy dew, d ew ca n be collected by tying rags or tuffs of fine grass around y our ankles. While walking through dewy grass before sunrise, the rags or grass will s aturate and ca n be rung out into a container. The rags or grass can be replaced an d the process is repeated. (2) Rainfall . Rainwater collected directly in clean cont ainer or in pl ants that contain no h armful toxins is generally safe to d rink without disinf ecting. The survivor shoul d always be prepared to collect rainfall at a mo ments notice. An inverted ponc ho wo rks well to col lect rainfall. 03- 2 MSVX.02.03"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"3. HAZARD OUS FLUIDS (MSVX.02.03b ) a. Survivors have occasionally attempted to au gment the ir water suppl y with other fluids, such as alcoholi c beverages, urine, blood, o r seawater. Wh ile it is true that each of th ese flui ds has a high water conten t, the impurities they contain ma y require the bod y to expend more flui d to pu rify them. Some haza rdous fluids a re: (1) Sea water . Sea water in more th an mini mal quantitie s is ac tually toxic. The concentration of sodium and ma gnesium salts is so high that fluid must be drawn from the body to eliminate th e salts an d eventually the kidn eys cease to function. (2) Alcohol . Alcohol d ehydrates the bod y and c louds jud gment. S uper-cooled liquid, if ingested, can cause immediate fro stbite of the throat, a nd pot ential death. (3) Blood . Blood, b esides bein g salty, is a food. Drinkin g it wi ll require the body to expe nd addition al fluid to di gest it. (4) Urine . Dr inking urine is not only foolish, but also dangerous. Urine is nothin g more than the bod y’s waste. Drinkin g it only places this was te back into t he body, which requires more fluid to process it again. 4. WATER QUALITY . Water contains minerals, toxins, and pathogens. Some of th ese, consumed in large enough qu antities may be harmful to huma n health. Patho gens are our primary concern. Pathogens are divided into Vi rus, C ysts, Bacteria, and Par asites. Ce rtain 03- 3 MSVX.02.03"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"pathogens are more resistant to c hemicals and sma ll enough to move through micr oscopic holes in equipme nt (i.e., T-shirt, parachute).

Water qu ality is divid ed into th ree levels of saf ety with disinf ection a s the most desired level, t hen pur ified, follow ed by potable. a. Disinfection . Water disinfection r emove s or destroys harmful microor ganisms. Giardia cysts are an ever-present danger in clear appearing mount ain water throughout the world. By drinking non-pot able water you may contract diseases or swallow organisms that could harm you. Examples of such dise ases or organisms are: Dysentery, Cholera, Typhoid, Fluk es, and Leeches. b. Remembe r, impure w ater, no m atter how overpowering the thirst, is one of the worst hazards in a survival situation. c. The first step in disinf ecting is to s elect a treatment method. The two methods w e will di scuss ar e as follows : (MSVX .02.03 c) (1) Heat . Th e Ma nual of Na val Preventive Medicine (P-5010) states that you must bring the water to a rolling boil be fore it is conside red safe for human consumpti on. This is th e most preferred method. (a) Bringing water to th e boilin g poin t will kill 99.9% of all Giardia cysts. The Gi ardia cyst dies at 60 O C and Cr yptosporidium dies at 65C. Wate r will boil at 14,000 ’ at 86 O C and at 10,000 ’ at 90C. With this in mind you should note that altitude does not make a difference unless you are extremely high. (2) Chemicals . There are nume rous types of ch emicals that can disinf ect water. Below ar e a few of the most comm on. In a survival situation, y ou will use whatever you have available. (a) Iodine Tablets. (b) Chlori ne Bleach. (c) Iodine Solution. (d) Betadine Solution. (e) Milit ary water purif ication tablets. (MSVX.02.03d ) These tablets are standard issue for all DOD a gencies.

(MSVX.02.04a ) Any type of she lter, wheth er it is a permanent building, tentage, or an expedi ent shelter must meet six basic criteria to b e safe and effective. The characteristics are: a. Protection F rom the Elements . Th e shelter must provide protection from rain, snow, wind, s un, etc. b. Heat Retention . It must have some type of insulation to r etain heat; thus preventing the was te of fuel. c. Ventilation . Ve ntilation mus t be constructed, especially if bu rning fuel for heat. This prevents the accumulati on of carbon mono xide. Ventilation is a lso needed for carbon dioxide given off when breathing. d. Drying Facility . A d rying facility must be constructed to d ry wet clothes. e. Free from Natural H azards . Shelt ers shoul d not b e built in areas of avalanche hazards, under rock fall or “standin g dead” trees have the potential to fall on y our shelter. f. Stabl e . Shelt ers must be constructed to withstand the pressures exerted by severe weather. 2. NATURAL SHELTERS . Natural shelters are usually the preferred types because they take less time and m aterials construct. T he following may be made into natu ral shelters with some modification. (MSVX .02.04b ) a. Caves or Rock Overhangs . Ca n be modif ied by laying walls of rocks, logs or branches across the open s ides. b. Hollow L ogs . Can be cleaned o r dug out, then enhanced wi th poncho s, tarps or parachutes hun g across the openings. c. Hazards of Natu ral Shelters . (1) Anima ls . Natural shelters ma y already be inh abited (i.e. bears, coyotes, lions, r ats, snakes, etc.). Oth er concerns from animals may be disease from scat or decaying carcasses. (2) Lack of Ve ntilation . Natu ral shelters may not have adequate ventilation.

Poncho Shelt er . This is on e of th e easiest she lters to c onstruct. Materials needed for construction are cord and any water-repellent mate rial (i.e. ponc ho, parachute, tarp). It should be one of the first types of shelter considered if pl annin g a short stay in an y one place.

A surprising amount of heat will boun ce back from the fire into the shelter. 6. FIRES . Fires fall into two m ain ca tegories: those built for cookin g and t hose built for warmth and s ignaling. The basic steps are the same for both: preparing the fire lay, gathering fuel, bui lding the fire, and pr operly extinguishing the fire. a. Preparing the fire lay . There are two t ypes of fire lays: fire pit and Dakota hole. Fire pits ar e prob ably the most common. (1) Create a windb reak to c onfin e the heat and p revent the wind fr om scattering sparks. Place rocks or logs used in constructing the fire lay parallel to th e wind. Th e prevailing downwind end should be narrower to create a chimney effect. (2) Avoid us ing wet rocks. H eat acting on th e dampne ss in s andstone, shale, and stones from streams may cause them to explode. (3) Dakota Hole . (MSVX .02.05a ) The Dakota Hol e is a tactical fire lay. Althou gh no f ire is 100% tactical, this fi re lay will a ccompli sh certain thin gs: (a) Reduces the signature of th e fire by placing it below g round. (b) Provides more of a concentrated heat source to boil a nd cook, t hus preserving fuel and l essening the amount of bu rning time. (c) By creating a large air draft, the fire will burn with less smoke than the fire pit. 04- 7 MSVX.02.04"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"(d) It is easier to lig ht in high wind s. DAKATA HOLE b. Gather Fuel . Ma ny Marines take shortcuts wh en gathering firewood. T aking a few extra minutes can mean th e diff erence between ease and frustration when buildin g a fire. (MSVX.02.05b ) (1) Tinder . Tind er is the init ial fuel. It should b e fine and dry. Gather a doubl e handful of t inder for the fire to b e built and an extra doubl e handful to b e stored in a dry place for the followin g morning. Dew can moisten tinder enough to make li ghting the fire diffic ult. Some examples are: (a) Shredded cedar/juniper bark, pin e needles. (b) Dry grass. (c) Slivers shaved f rom a dry stick. (d) Hornet's nest. (e) Natural fibers from equipme nt supplemented with pin e pitch (i.e., cotton b attle dressing). (f) Cotton balls a nd petroleum jelly or Cha r-cloth. Note : Sticks used for t inder should be dry and not larger than the diamete r of a toothpi ck. (2) Kindlin g . Thi s is the material that is ignited by the tind er that will burn l ong enough to ignite the fuel. 04- 8 MSVX.02.04"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"(a) Small sticks/twi gs pencil-thick up t o the thickness of the thumb. Ensure that the y are dry. (b) Due to a typically large resin content, e vergreen limbs often mak e the best kindlin g. The y burn hot a nd fast, but t ypically do not la st long. (3) Fuel Wood . Fuel Wood is used to keep the blaze going long enough to fulfill its purpose. Ideally, it shoul d burn slow enough to conserve the wood pile, ma ke plenty of heat, and leave an ample supply of long-lasting coals. (a) Firewood b roken from the dead limbs of standin g trees or windfalls held off t he ground will h ave absorbed less moistur e and the refore should bu rn easily. (b) Refrain from cutting down liv e, green trees. (c) Softwoods (evergreens and c onifers) wil l burn hot and f ast with lots of smoke and sp ark, leavin g little in the way of coals. H ardwoods (b road leaf trees) will burn sl ower with l ess smoke and leave a good bed o f coals. (d) Learn the wood s indigenous to the area. Birch, dogwood, a nd mapl e are excellent fu els. Osage orange, ironwood, a nd manzanita, thou gh difficult to break up, m ake terrific coals. Asp en and cottonwood bu rn clean but l eave littl e coals. (e) Stack y our wood suppl y close enough to be handy, but f ar enough from the flames to be safe. Protect your supply from additional precipitation. (f) If you happ en to g o down in an a ircraft that has not bu rned, a mixture of gas and oil may be used. Us e caution wh en igniting this mixture. c. Building the Fire . The type of fire built will b e dependent upon its int ended us e; either cooking or heating and signaling. (1) Cooking Fires . The followin g listed fires are best us ed fo r cooking: (a) Teepee Fire . The teepee fire is used to produce a concentrated heat source, primaril y for cooki ng.

Scrape your knife or carbon steel against th e flint to produc e a spark onto t he tinder. Some types of fli nt & steel designs wil l have a block of ma gnesium attached to t he device which can be shav ed ont o the tinder prior to igniting. Other designs may have magnesium mixe d into the flint to p roduce a higher quality of sp ark. (2) Primitive Methods . Primitive fire methods are those developed by early man. There are numerous t echniqu es that fall into this c ategory. The only method that wil l be taught at MCMWTC is the Bow & Drill. (3) Bow & Drill . (MSVX.02.05b ) The techniqu e of st arting a fire with a bo w & drill is a true field expedi ent fire starting method w hich requires a piece of cord and knif e from your survival kit to construct. The compone nts of the bow & drill are bow, drill, socket, fire board, embe r patch, and birds ne st. (a) Bow . The bow is a resilient, g reen stick ab out 3/4 of an inch in diameter and 30-36 in ches in length. Th e bow s tring can be any type of cord, howe ver, 550 c ord wor ks best. Ti e the string from one end of the bow to the other, without an y slack. (b) Drill . The drill should be a straight , seasoned ha rdwood stic k about 1/2 to 3/ 4 of an inch in di amete r and 8 t o 12 in ches in length. T he top end is tapered to a blunt point to r educe friction g enerated in the socket. Th e bottom end is s lightly rounded to fit snugly into th e depression on the f ire boa rd. (c) Socket . The socket is an easily grasped stone or piece of h ardwood o r bone with a slight depression on on e side. Us e it to hol d the drill in place and t o apply downward pressure. (d) Fire board . The fire board is a seasoned softwood bo ard which should ideally be 3/4 of an inch thick, 2-4 inches wide, and 8-10 i nches long. Cut a d epression 3/4 of an inch from the edge on on e side of the fire board. Cut a U-shap e notch from the edge of the fire board int o the depression. This not ch is designed to c ollect and form an embe r whi ch will b e use d to i gnite the tinder. (e) Ember P atch . The ember patch is made f rom any type of suit able material (i.e., leather, aluminu m foil, b ark). It is used to ca tch and transfer the ember from the fire board to the birds nest. Ideally, it should be 4 inches by 4 inches in size. 04- 11 MSVX.02.04"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"(f) Birds Ne st . The birds nest is a doubl e handful of tinder which will be made into the shape of a nest. Tinder must be dry and finely shredded material (i.e., out er bark from junip er/cedar/sage brush o r inner bark from cottonwood/a spen or d ry grass/moss). Lay your tinder out in two equal rows abou t 4 in ches wide and 8-12 in ches long. Loosely roll the first row into a ball and kn ead the tind er to further break down th e fibers. Place this b all perpendicular onto the second r ow of t inder and wrap. Knead the tinder until all fibers of th e ball are interwoven. Insert the drill half way into th e ball to form a partial cylinder. This is whe re the ember will be placed. (4) Producing a fire usin g the bow & drill . (a) Place the embe r patch und er the U-shaped not ch. (b) Assume the kneeling position, with th e left foot on the fire bo ard near the depression. (c) Load the bow w ith the drill. Ensure the drill is between the wood of the bow and bow s tring. Place the drill into th e depression on the f ire board. Place the socket on the tapered end of the d rill. (d) Use the left hand t o hold th e socket while applying downwa rd pressure. (e) Use the right hand to grasp the bow. Wi th a smooth sawing motion, move the bow back and forth to twi rl the drill. (f) Once you have established a smooth motion, smoke will appear. Once smoke appears, app ly more downward pressure and saw th e bow faster. (g) When a thick layer of smoke has accumulated around th e depression, stop all movement. Remove the bo w, drill, and soc ket from the fire board, without moving th e fire board. Car efully remove your left foot off the fire board. (h) Gently tap the fire board to e nsure all of the embe r has fallen out of th e U-shaped notch a nd is lying on the emb er patch. Re move the fire board. (i) Slowl y fan the black powd er to solid ify it into a glowing ember.

(g) Birds nest w ill not i gnite- Tinder not d ry. Nest woven too tight. Ti nder not kn eaded enou gh. Blowing too hard (embe r will fracture). e. Extinguis hing the Fire . The fire must be properly extin guishe d. Thi s is accomplished by using the drown, s tir, and feel method. (1) Drown the fire by pouring at water in the fire lay. (2) Stir the ember bed to e nsure that the fire is complet ely out. (3) Check the bed of your fire by feeling for any hot spots. (4) If any hot spots are found, st art the process all over again.

This le sson r elates to all of the training that you will receive here at MC MWTC. OUT LINE 1. POSITIVE LEAD ERSHIP AND THE RIG HT ATTITUDE . Leadership must be by example. At first, harsh and unf amiliar c onditi ons tend to b e frightening. Marines will find themselves up against man y challenges they have never met before and the environment will constantly remind them that they can become a casualty if the y make m istakes. Ag gressive leadership, whi ch consis tently meets an d overcomes the challenges of th e envi ronme nt, is essential to mission accomplish ment. There will be two enemies to c ontend with: th e enemy soldier and the environment itself. T he first step tow ards de feating these enemies is getting your Marines in th e right mental a ttitude. Th e leader must maintain a pos itive attitude towards the mission, his Ma rines, and the equi pment th ey have to carry out t he job. Y ou can be defeated psychologically, if you are not aware of the symptoms of a poor ly motivated uni t. a. Core Values applied in a survi val situation . Cor e value are very applicable to leadership in a survival situation. In the absence of con stant adherence to our core values, subordinate Marines ma y suffer the consequences of injury and in extr eme cases, DEATH. b. Honor . Honor is int egrity, responsibilit y, and accountabilit y. Without hono r in this type of environment, decisions are made with inaccurate and/or mislea ding information. D ishono rable actions or intentions ulti mately lead to un ethical behavior...t rust be tween Marines wil l erode, dependability will become unimportant, and the resultin g consequences to energy conservation wi ll greatly affect a unit’s cohesion and a bility to ac complish its mis sion. c. Courage . Courage is doing the right thing for the right reason. C ourage in this type of environme nt for small unit leaders to take charge of their unit . The added stress and pressure indu ced in mount ainous t errain makes th e tough decisions even tou gher to make: courag eous leade rs take that extra step.

Likewise, Marines must provid e the same safety and w ell-being for themselves and ot hers. Onl y through this t ype of commitment will a unit su ccessfully accomplish it mission. 2. LEADERSHIP CHALL ENGES PECUL IAR TO MOUNTAIN OPERATIONS Althou gh most leadership challenges in a t empe rate environment ar e the same in cold we ather, some problems will arise which must be quickly corrected. a. Cocoon-like Existence . Ma ny men, when bundl ed up in s uccessive layers of cl othin g and wit h their head covered by a hood, t end to withdraw within th emselves a nd to assume a “cocoon-like existenc e”. When so clot hed, the indi vidual's hearing and field of vision are greatly restricted and he tends to b ecome oblivious to his surroundings. His mental f aculties become sluggish and althou gh he looks, h e doe s not se e. Leaders must recognize and ov ercome these symptoms. Addit ionally, the leader needs to w atch for the growth of lethargy within himself and must be alert to prevent it. He must always appear alert to his men and prevent them from sinkin g into a state of co coon-like exis tence. (1) If your Marines wit hdraw into a shell or become mood y and d epressed, ge t them involv ed in c onversations with ea ch oth er. (2) Don’ t accept an excuse for not carrying out a n order. Cold weather training all too o ften be comes a camping trip. Leadership must challenge their Marines to train as they would fi ght. (3) If Marines still displ ay a “Cocoon- like” existence, have them engage in physical activity. b. Individual a nd Group Hib ernation . Thi s problem is similar i n manifestation o f withd rawal f rom the env ironme nt. It is generally recognized by a tendency of indivi duals to se ek the comfort of sleeping bags, and b y the group rem aining in tents or other shelter at the neglect of th eir duties. In extreme cases, guard and security measures ma y be jeopardized. Many times, it is the leadership that violates this, thus destroying the unit’s trust and conf idence. 05- 2 MSVX.01.01"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"(1) The leader must ensure that all personn el remain alert and active. Ridged insist ence upon p roper execution of all military duties and the prompt and proper performanc e of the many group “chores” is e ssential. (2) Be alert for individu als who will place their own ph ysical comfort ahead of their assigned duti es. Remind them that their mission as Marines is to fi ght, and to do s o suc cessfully requires that weapons and e quipment be maintained in wo rking order. c. Personal Cont act and Com munica tions . It is essential that each ind ividual and group be kept info rmed of what i s happening. Due to th e deadening of the senses typically encountered in col d weather, a man left alone may quickly become oblivious to his surroundings, los e his sense of direction, his con cern for his unit, and in e xtreme cases, for himself. He may become l ike a sheep and mer ely follows al ong, not knowin g or caring whether his un it is advancing or withdrawing. Each commander must take strong measu res to ensure that small unit le aders keep their subordinates informed. This is particularly true of th e company commanders keeping their platoon commanders info rmed, of platoon c ommande rs informing their squad leaders, and th e squad leaders info rming t heir men. General information is o f value, but th e greatest import ance must be placed on matte rs of im mediate c oncern and inte rest to th e indivi dual. The chain of command must be rigidly followed and leaders must see that no ma n is left uninfo rmed as to his immediate sur roundin g and s ituation. (1) If your Marines find it h ard to r emember thin gs they have been taught, show patience and re view or ders, drills and SOP’s. Keep their minds busy. (2) Tempe rs normally flare up du ring this type of training, so expe ct and be prepared to d eal with it whe n it comes. Maintain your sense of humor, lead by example, and don ’t let unanticipated pr oblems get the bes t of you. d. Time/Distan ce Factors . Mount ain op erations do ctrine recommends that tactical commanders b e given every oppo rtunit y to exploit local situ ations an d take the initiative when the oppo rtunity is presented. B ecause of the increased amount of time involv ed in a moveme nt and the additional time required to a ccomplish even simple tasks, deviation from tactical pl ans is difficult. Tactical plans are developed after a thorough reconnaissance and det ailed estimate of the situation. Suff icient flexibilit y is allowed each subor dinate leader to use his initi ative and in genuity in accompli shing his m ission. Time lags are compensat ed fo r by time ly issuance of warning orders, by anticipating charges in the tactical situation, an d the early issuan ce of frag orders.

Conservation of En ergy . Two e nvironm ents must be overcome in mountainous regions; one created by the enemy and the second cr eated by the climate an d terrain. The climatic environment must not b e permitted to s ap the energy of th e unit to a point wh ere it can no lon ger cope with the enemy. The leader must be in sup erior physical cond ition.

Survival ASP ECTS OF LEAD ERSHIP . When dealing with leadership ch allenges in a survival situation, the f oremost weapon a leader must emplo y is his vigilance : a leader’s attention should be focused on e nsuring all Marines of the unit ar e contributin g to the overall success of the situation. a. Cohesion . As a leader, you must ensure that all mem bers of th e team are working towards the survivabilit y of the unit. Y ou can not al low individu als or small gr oups to formulat e their own goals or pl an of action. b. Self-Worth . A M arine without se lf-worth is a Marine who does not v alue living. Leadership is a critical; factor in build ing self-worth. Ta sks must be found fo r each Marine in whi ch best suits th eir situation whil e attempting to re ceive positi ve results. (i.e., A m an with a brok en leg can monitor the fire, A man with a broken arm ca n still procure water for the unit ). This will make ea ch and every Marine feel useful a nd not a burden to the other members, regardless of their individu al situation. c. Natural Reactions to Stress . Leadership must quickly identify natural reactions to signs of stress his M arines may be displ aying (i.e., Fear, Anxiet y, Guilt, De pression). Failure to recognize th ese signs early will result in injuries, illness, or death which will re duce the unit’ s comba t effectiveness. Corrective action mus t be taken immediatel y 4 d. Will to Survive . The will to su rvive is a “mind -set” that mus t be instilled an d reinforced within al l Marines. W ithout the “will to su rvive”, Marines will not succeed.

Set thi s tiny rod up right on your flat piece of mater ial so that the sun will c ause it to cast a shadow. Mark the positi on where the base of th e rod sits so it can be returned to the same spot for later readings. Secure the mate rial so that it will not move and mark the positi on of the material with str ing, pebbles, or twigs, so that if you have to move the paper you can put it ba ck exa ctly as it was. Now, mark t he tip of th e rod's shadow. b. As the sun m oves, the shadow-tip moves . Make repeated shadow- tip mark ings every 15 minutes .

The Nor th Star i s the last star in the handle of th e little dipp er, whi ch is not the easiest conste llation to find. H owev er, the Big Dipp er is one of the most prominent constellations in the Northern He misphere. The two low est stars of the Big Dipp er's cup ac t as point ers to th e North Star. If you line up th ese two stars, they make a straight line that runs directly to the North Star. T he distance to th e North Sta r along this lin e is 5 times that between the two point er stars. 07- 8 MSVX.02.07"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"(2) Using Cassi opeia ( B i g M o r W ). Draw a line straight out f rom the center star, approximatel y half the distance to the Big Dipper. The North Sta r will be located there. LOCATING THE NORTH STAR NO T E : Because the Big Dipp er and Cassiop eia rotate around t he North Star, they will not always appear in the same position in th e sky. In the higher latitudes, the North Star is less effective for the purpo se of orienting because it appears higher in the sky. At th e center of the Arctic circle, it would b e directly overhead, and all directions lead South. c. Southe rn Cross . In the Southern H emispher e, Polaris is not visible. There, the Southe rn Cross is the most distin ctive constellation. An ima ginary line through the long axis of the Souther n Cross, o r True Cross, points towa rds a dark spot devoid of stars approximatel y three degrees offset from the South Pole. The Tru e Cross should not b e confuse d with the larger cross ne arby know a s the False Cross, w hich is less bright, more wid ely spaced, and ha s five stars.

There are three improvised t echniques to construct a compa ss. a. Synthetic techniqu e . The required items are a piece of synthetic mate rial, (i.e., parachute clot h), and a small piece of iron o r steel that is lon g, thin, and l ight. Aluminu m or yellow metals won 't work (only things that rust will do) . A pin o r needle is pe rfect, but a straightened pa per clip, pi ece of steel b aling wire, or barbed wire could also wor k. (1) Stroke the needle repeatedly in on e direction ag ainst the synthetic material. Ensure that you lift the mater ial a few inches up into the air at the end of each stroke, returning to the beginning of th e needle befo re descending for another 07- 10 MSVX.02.07"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"stroke in the same direction. D o this a pproximatel y 30 strokes. This will magnetize the needle. (2) Float the metal on still w ater using balled up p aper, wood c hip, or leaf. Gather some water in a non-magnetic container or a scooped out r ecess in the ground, su ch as a puddl e. Do not use a \"tin can\" which is made of steel. (An aluminum can would be fine.) Pla ce the float on th e water, then the metal on it. It will slowl y turn to orient itself. b. Magnet techniqu e . You wil l achieve the same results b y using a ma gnet. Follow th e same steps as you did with th e synthetic material. Th e magn ets you are most likely to have available to you are those in a speaker or headphone s of a radio. c. Magnetization th rough a battery . A powe r source of 2 vol ts or more from a battery can be used with a short length of insulated wi re to ma gnetize me tal. Coil the wire around a needle. If the wire is non -insula ted, wr ap the needle with paper or cardboard. Attach the ends to the battery terminals for 5 minut es. d. Associated problems with improvised c ompasses . The followin g are comm on problems with all impr ovised compas ses. (1) Soft steel tends to lose its ma gnetism fairly quickly, so you will have to demagnetize your needle occasionally, thou gh you should not have to do this more th an two or three times a day. (2) Test your compass b y distu rbing it after it settles. D o this several times . If it returns to th e same alignment, you're OK. It will b e lined up no rth and south, though you will have t o determine by other means w hich end is nort h. Use the sun, stars, or any other natural signs in the area.

Knowin g the habit s of the animal you want t o trap or snare will h elp in crease your chances. Such things as when and wh ere they move , feed, and wa ter will help you determine wh ere the set can be most effectively placed. (2) Keep thin gs simple . You don 't have time in a surviv al situ ation to c onstruct elaborate sets and t hey do not n ecessarily do a better job. (3) Place sets in the right place . Animals will travel and stop in ce rtain lo cations. That is where to build s ets. (4) Cover up your scent . Animals will avoid a set, whi ch smells threatening or unusual to them (i.e., human s cent or P.O. L.’s from equipment or clothing). (a) Man leaves a scent thr ough the pores of the s kin b y the swe at glands. Use an odo rless contact glove when build ing a set. It may take up to three days for your scent to diss ipate if made without g loves. (b) Certain boot soles an d clothing may leave a scent, generally this can be detected by the human nose . If noticed, attempt to mask th e scent with smoke from your fire (5) Use the right type of set . Ce rtain sets wor k better than oth ers do fo r a particular anima l. (6) Use the correct equipment . Usi ng the correct equipment is pa ramount to success. This inc ludes the weight of th e lifting device in p roportion to the animal’s weight, th e cordage or wi re to hold the animal’s strength, and tri gger tension. (7) Check traps .

Althou gh snares can be used wit h rope or cord, they are less effective than wi re. Wire should ha ve memory and r esist kinkin g. Aircraft cable type 7x7, in sizes 1/16 to 3/8 inch should be used. This type of wire prevents animal chew out and resists b reakage. Remember that you want the smallest di ameter cable capable of hold ing the animal. (2) Locking device . A lo cking device is impe rative for a snare to wo rk properly. Locking devices secure the snare around the a nimal’ s neck. Th ere are several methods available for a locking device.

Cooking me at will kill bacteria and pa rasites. A ll game will be c ooked unti l it is thoroughly well done . There are no l eftovers in surviv al. Cook only what you can immediately consume. Ideally, you should e at the heart and liv er first to avoid spoili ng. There are two methods of cooki ng. 1) Boiling . This is the best method for c ooking. Boiling enables the su rvivor to consume the animal fat and nutr ients, which coll ect in th e broth. 2) Roas ting . This method is was teful and will not be ut ilized in a su rvival situation. 4. TANNING HI DES (MSVX.02.09b ) A. Fleshin g . Fleshing is the actual removal of meat, tissu e, and fat from the hide. Fleshing is easier when don e as soon a s possibl e, preferably before the hide starts to d ry. 1) Soak o r wet the hide if dry. 2) Lay the hide on a solid, smooth, round obj ect (i.e., log or canteen). 3) Holdin g a bayonet, blunt kni fe, sharp ston e or bone tool sc rapper at a 10 degree angle away from the bod y, push the fat and me mbrane off th e leather. Be careful not to make holes in th e more tender parts of the belly. For beaver and b adger the fat must be cut off th e hide. 4) Continue this until a ll the fat is complet ely removed. 09- 1 MSV X.02.09"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"B. Stretching . A fresh g reen or soaked hide must be stretched. Str etching is accomplished b y either making a frame or using the ground. 1) Frame stretching invo lves lacing the hide to a frame with cordage and pullin g it tight. 2) Ground s tretching involv es staking the hide tight to th e ground. 3) A Frame c an also be created by bending a stick ba ck on it ’s self. 4) The less a hi de shrinks and h ardens the softer it will be at the end of th e process. C. Hair . 1) Using a sharp ston e tool sc rapper scrape off the hair. Soaking the hide in water will make this p rocess easier. D. Braining . The brain acts as a lubricant an d provides a tempor ary water repellant. 1) Soak th e hide on the stretcher. 2) Extract the brain from the animal. 3) Mix the brains with water to c reate a pasty solution. 4) Once the brains are warm and tho roughly mixed rub into the hide. Firmly rub t he mixture into hi de with your hand on onl y the hairless sid e. E. Graining . This step fo rces the brains thorou ghly into the leather. 1) Spon ge on w ater to fu rther dampen hid e. 2) Using a blunt e nd of a pol e, apply pressure ove r every inch, s crapping and stretching the fibers until most of the water is gone from the skin. 3) Tighten the hide on the stretcher and allow it to dry. F. Rubbing . The next critical step is the high friction rubbin g needed to c reate a little heat and finish the drying, stretching, and b reaking of th e grain. Either method can be used. 1) Cut the skin from the frame around t he perimeter, leaving only the lacing holes an d hair that coul d not b e remov ed. 2) Use a on e half in ch rope attached between two t rees. Grasp the skin at different points a ll around i ts perimete r and pu ll, pull, pul l. 3) If rope is not a vailable, rub t he skin b y sittin g on th e ground a nd hook ing the skin over your feet and pull ing.

Anima l Hid e Uses . Animal hide uses are limited only by the imagination. L isted below a re a few ideas: 5. PRESERVING ME ATS (MSV.02.09 c) A. Botul ism . (MSVX .02.09d ) Botulism is an often-fatal food poisonin g caused by imprope rly preserved meats. Botul ism grows in a controlled en vironment. The acronym \"TOM\" is us eful in defeating botul ism. If any one of the three elements is removed from the preserving process, botulism cannot liv e. 1) Tempe rature, botulism thrives be tween 40-140 de grees F. 2) O- Oxygen, botulism needs an airtight environment to live . 3) M- Mois ture, botulism needs a moist environment to liv e. B. Freezing . 1) Before freezing, cut the meat into pi eces of a size th at can be used one at a time. 2) Keep it fr ozen until r eady to us e. Remember, m eat will spoil i f thawed and refrozen. C. Cooling . 1) Place meat in a metal or wood en container with a lid. Th e container should b e ventilated. 2) Set it in water or bury it in d amp earth, preferably in a s haded location. 3) Do not th row mold y meat aw ay; cut or scrape off the mold and cook a s usual. D. Jerky . Jerky allows the meat to last a couple of weeks whil e reducing the weight of meat by dehydrating it. Jerky is ma de from the meat onl y. 1) Cut meat into thin st rips about 1/4 inc h thick. Remove all thick po rtions of fat. 2) Place meat by a fire to lightly smoke it. Y ou are attempting to dev elop a thin crust l ayer on the meat. This serves to d eter the bugs and i nsects. Reme mber to use hard woods and not conifer type wood. You wa nt to smoke it, not cook th e meat. 09- 1 MSV X.02.09"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"3) Once the meat has a crust layer, remove th e meat and pl ace strips on a hanger for the air to dry it for approximatel y 24 hour s. Once dry, break down f ibers by slightly pullin g apart the meat and allow it to dry another 24 hou rs. 4) When it becomes hard and brittle, i t is taken down and s tored in b reathable bags or cloth. I t is used in st ews, soups, or roasted lightly on coals an d eaten. 5) Small animals, fish, and b irds are dried whol e. After they are skinned, th e back is cracked between the l egs, a stick is inserted to hold th e bod y cavity open. Th e animal is lightly smoked and laid out in th e sun to d ry. When thoroughly dried, they are pound ed until th e bones are crushed. Another day in th e air will d ry the marrow and e nsure preservation. E. Pemmican . Pem mican allows meat to last for several months . 1) Dry berries and pound in to a paste. 2) Dried jerky is added to the paste. 3) Melted su et (the hard fatty tissu es around the kidne ys) is mixed with the berries and jerky. 4) Roll the mixture into small balls and place in th e cleaned intestines of a large animal. 5) The intestine sack is tied shut, se aled wi th suet and stored in plastic or leather bags. 6.

Other materials. 10- 1 MSVX.02.10"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"f. Stone . Stone will make a n excellent striking, puncturing or choppin g tool, but will not hold a fine edge. Some stone s, such as chert, flint, or obsidian can have very fine edges. (1) Chipping & Flaking . To make a sharp-edge piece of ston e, a chippin g tool a nd flaking tool is ne eded. A chippin g tool is a light, blunt- edged tool use d to break off s mall pieces of ston e. A flaking tool is a pointe d tool used to b reak off thin, flattened pieces of ston e. You can mak e a chipping tool from wood, bone, or metal, and a flaking tool fr om bone, antler tines, or soft i ron. (2) Weapon heads . Certain stones will shatter unde r pressure when force is delivered upon it. W hen selecting a stone, test its hardness prior to use . g. Bone . Bone has man y uses. Hooks, sh aft tips, scrapers, awls , sockets an d handles are just a f ew ideas. (1) Raw Bon e . Raw bon e must be shattered with a heavy object, su ch as a rock. (2) Shapin g & Sharpening . From the pieces of sh attered bone , select a suitable point ed splinter. You ca n further shap e and sha rpen this splint er by rubbin g it on a r ough surfaced rock or metal f ile (i.e., from your multi-purpose knife). h. Wood . Wood uses are unlimited. A knife blade can sha pe the wood i nto an y desired shape. 10- 2 MSVX.02.10"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"(1) Types . Wood is classified into two g eneral categories: hard and so ft. Hardwood is p referred for all sur vival uses . To t est th e wood st rength, press your fingernail into th e grain of the wood. I f a print is visible, the wood is generally soft. (2) Sharpening . All wood poi nts are sharpened to the side of the shaft. Wood is weakest at the center and will not hol d a point. (3) Fire hardening . Wood that is un seasoned or “green” wood should b e fire hardened prior to use . To t est this wood, ge ntly scrape the bark with your thumbnail. If moisture o r a greenish tint appears, it is cons idered green. Fire harden it b y holding the point of the instrument a few inches above a bed of hot coals while slowl y rotating it. Gradually the wood will b egin to hiss a nd steam. Fire hardening makes th e cells swell an d the sap thicken, whi ch mak es the wood mor e resistant to ab rasion and co ncussion. Avoid c harring the wood. Fire harden onl y the tip until light brown. (4) Coal burning . It is very difficult to carve depression s in wood. A dep ression in wood ca n be made by a process called coal-burning. Usin g a pair of thon gs, place a hot coal over the area you want to hol low out, then blow on the embers with a thin, s teady stream of air to ke ep them glowing. If available, use a thin reed or length of hollow bone to direct the stream of air. After the coals have burned down, sc rape out the charred wood w ith a knife or sharp rock. Repe at this process with fresh sets of c oals until th e depression is a t the desired depth. i. Metal . Me tal is the best mate rial to make fi eld expedi ent edged weapons. W hen properly designed, met al can fulfill a knife's three uses: pun cture, slice or chop, and cut. First, select a suitable piece of me tal, one that most resembles the des ired end product. De pendin g on th e size and o riginal shape, you can obtain a point a nd cut ting edge by rubbin g the metal on a rough surfaced stone or metal fil e. If the metal is soft enough, you can hammer out on e edge while the metal is cold.

Plasti c can also be melted as a adhesive. (3) Parachute cord . Parachute cord has unlimited uses for construction of field expedient tools. (4) Pine pitc h glue . Pine pitc h glue, when properly made is lik e an e poxy. Locate and r emove pitch from a pine tree. The highest quality pitch to use is fresh sap. The older (dry and ha rd) sap will work, but not a s well. Me lt the pitch on an elevated platform, such as a smooth rock. Th e pitch will run dow n the platform.

As a field expedi ent we apon, th e club does not protect you from enemy soldiers. It can, howe ver, extend y our area of defense beyond your fingertips. It also serves to inc rease the force of a bl ow without injuri ng yourself. There are two t ypes of clubs: simple and weighted. a. Simple club . A simple club is a staff or branch. It must be sho rt enough for you to swing easily, but l ong and strong enough to damage whatever you hit. Its diameter should fit c omfor tably in the palm, but not be so thin as t o break easily upon impact. b. Weighte d club . A we ighted club is any simple club with a weight on on e end. Th e weight may be a natural weight, such as a knot on the wood, o r something ad ded, such as a stone lashed to the club. I f adding a weight to t he club, con struction is as follows: (1) Find a stone that has a shape which will a llow you to lash it securely to th e club. A stone with a slight hourglass shape works we ll. If a suita bly shaped stone cannot be found, you must fashion a g roove or channel into the stone by a techniqu e known as pecking. By repeatedly rapping the club ston e with a smaller hard ston e, you can get the desired sha pe. 10- 4 MSVX.02.10"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"(2) Find a piece of wood th at is the right length.

(1) Find a pole as long as you can effectively handle. (2) Attach a noos e of wi re or stiff co rd at the small end. (3) To catch an animal, slip th e noos e ove r the neck and pull it tight. 10- 6 MSVX.02.10"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"c. Sling shot . A Y- shaped sti ck can easily be made into a sling shot. A slin g shot is an extremely effective and a ccurate weapon. (1) Locate a hardwood, Y- shaped piece of stick. (2) From your surviv al kit, attach the sling shot r ubber and pou ch. d. Throwing stick . One of the simplest weapons for survival is the throwin g stick. As a tool, t he throwing stick ca n be used to kno ck dead br anches out of a tree that would normall y be too h igh to r each. The dead branches can then be used as firewood. (1) Find a stick straight as possibl e, 2.5 -3 feet long, and 1.5 -2 inches in di amete r. (2) Remove the bark from the stick. (3) Taper each end of th e stick. (4) Fire harden the entire stick if using green wood. (5) There are two methods of em ploying the throwing stick. When in forested area, the bes t method is to use an overhand throwing motion. In an open area, you can increase the killin g radius by using a sidearm throwing motion. 4. Cordag e . Before making cordage, there are a few simple tests that can be don e to d etermine the material's suit ability. First, pull on a length of the mate rial to test for strength. Next, twist it between your fingers and roll the fibers together. If it withsta nds this h andling and does not snap apart, tie an overhand knot with th e fibers and gently tighten. if the knot do es not br eak, the material is usab le. a.

GENE RAL CONSIDERAT IONS . There are very few regions throughout th e wor ld without some type of edible vegetation. Plants c ontain vitamins, miner als, protein, carbohydrates, and di etary fiber. Some plants also cont ain fats. The followin g are general considerations: a. D o not assume that because birds or animals have eaten a plant, it is edibl e by huma ns. b. Poor plant recognition skil ls will seriously limit your ability to survive. c. Plant do rmancy and snowf all make fo raging plants d ifficult dur ing the wint er months. d.

The basic types of le af arrangements are oppo site, alternate, compound, simple, and basal ros ette. d. Root Struc ture . The basic types of root st ructures are the bulb, c love, taproot, tuber, rhizome, corm, and cr own. B ulbs are familiar to us as onions a nd, wh en sli ced in half, will show co ncentric rings. Cloves are those bulb- like structu res that remind us of g arlic and wil l separate into s mall pieces when b roken apart. This c haracteristic separates wild onions f rom wild garlic. Taproots resemble c arrots and ma y be single-rooted or branched, but usuall y only one plant st alk arises from each root. Tub ers are like potatoes and daylilies and you will find these structures either on s trings or in c lusters unde rneath the parent plants. Rhizo mes are large creeping rootstocks or und erground stems and man y plants arise from the “eyes” of th ese roots. Corm s are similar to bulbs but are solid wh en cut rather than pos sessin g rings. A crown is th e type of root st ructure found on pl ants such as asparagus and looks much lik e a mop- head und er the soil ’s surface. 11- 4 MSVX.02.11"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"3. DETE RMININ G ED IBILITY . The thou ght of h aving a diet cons isting only of pl ant food is oft en dis tressing. This is not the case if the survival epi sode is e ntered into with the confidence and intelligence based on knowl edge or expe rience. If a Marine know s what to look fo r, can iden tify it, and know how to prepare it prop erly for eating, there is no r eason why he can’t find suste nance. a. Types of plants to a void . (MSVX.02.11a ) Experts e stimate th ere are about 300,000 classified plan ts. The re are two consid erations th at must be kept in mind when procuring plant food. The first conside ration is that the plant be edibl e, and preferably, palatable. Next, it must be fairly abundant in th e areas in which it is found. If it includes an ined ible or poisonous variety in its f amily, the edible plant must be distin guishable to th e average eye from the poisonous on e. Usually a plant is selected because one special part is edible, such as the stalk, the fruit, o r the nut. Whe n selecting an unknown pl ant as a possibl e food sour ce, apply the followin g general rules: (1) Mushrooms and Fungi . These should not be s elected because they have toxic peptides, a protein-base poison w hich has no taste. (2) Plants with umbrella -shaped flow ers . These plants are to be complet ely avoided, althou gh carrots, celery, dill, and p arsley are members of this family. One of the most poisonous pl ants, pois on water hemlock, is al so a member of this f amily. (3) Beans, Peas, and Se eds in pods . All of t he legume f amily should b e avoi ded (beans and p eas). They absorb minerals from the soil an d cause problems. The most common miner al absorbed is s elenium. Selenium is wha t has given locowe ed its fame.

(MSVX.02.11b ) All pl ants th at cannot be positively identified will be prepared prop erly prior to testing for consumption. Do not prepare plants that are described by types of plants to avoid. Many harmful toxins contained in plants ca n be destroyed by heat, or are water solubl e, thou gh som e toxins remain exceptions. (1) Place one part (leaves, flow ers, stems, or roots) in a canteen cup. (2) Fill the canteen cup wit h water and boil. (3) After the water has boil ed, remove th e canteen cup from the heat source. Strain t he water out, l eaving the plant insid e the canteen cup. Cookin g and discarding the water can lessen or remove th e amount of toxins that ma y be contained in th e plant. T hese boili ng periods should l ast at least 5 minutes each. (4) Fill the canteen cup wit h water and repeat the process. (5) After straining the water out a s econd time, the plant ma y be tested. c. Plant te sting procedure . The US Milita ry has developed a plant testing procedure, which may not always guarantee the safety of pla nts for huma n consumption. This procedure should onl y be used in a l ong-term survi val situation as a last resort. (1) Ensure that you haven’t eaten any food fo r at least 8 hou rs. Prepare one canteen c up of c harcoal for emergency consumption. (2) Select a plant th at grows in sufficient qu antity in the local area. Separate the part of the plant you wish to test: root, stem, leaf, or flow er. Cer tain parts of plants are poisonous whil e the other parts may be edibl e. 11- 6 MSVX.02.11"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"(3) Rub a portion of the plant you have selected on y our inner forearm.

Keep the plant submer ged in the boiling water until it becomes saturated. B ring the cloth st raight up a nd wit h a twisting motion, wring the excess water back into the pot. Appl y the poulti ce to th e affected area as soon as it has cooled enough to place on t he wound. To be effective, the poulti ce should be as hot as you can tolerate. (3) Compress . A com press is made just like a poultic e, exce pt it is cold w hen applied to the wound. NOT E : Poul tice or Co mpress should be a pplied for 1 to 24 hours, a s needed. When applying a poultic e, you may expe rience a throbbin g pain a s it draws out the infection a nd neutralizes toxins.

Apply a fresh poulti ce as needed until t he desired level of h ealing has been reached. 11- 9 MSVX.02.11"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"6. POISONOUS PLANTS . (MSVX.02.11d ) Rarely will a survivo r have an ideal means of killing large game, though there are certain plants that can aid the survivo r. The two plants that we will t alk about are the Water Hemlock and Monkshood. a. Preparing Poisonous Plants . Once a poisonous plant has been located, di g up th e root of the plant. Th e roots of th e Water Hemlock and M onkshood ge nerally grow 8 to 10 inches deep. Extreme caution must be used when h andling the root. Do not handl e the root without a barrier between your hand s and th e root. A ba rrier can be gloves, socks, T-shirt, or even mos s. Split the root lengthwis e to expos e the inside of the root where the toxin is located. W ith the root split, rub the tip of y our spear/arrow insid e of the root op ening.

For example, catching insects such as grasshoppe rs can become frustrating and t iring. (1) At ni ght grasshoppers climb tall pl ants and c ling to th e stalks near the top. They can be picked from the plants in th e early morning w hile they are chilled and do rmant. (2) Dig for worms in damp hum us soil, under rocks/logs or look fo r them on the ground af ter it has rained. (3) Carpenter ants are found in d ead trees and stumps which can be gathered by hand. (4) Most other inse cts can be found in rot ten logs, under rocks, and in op en grassy areas. d. Preparing Edible Insects . (MSVX.02.12b ) (1) Insects with a hard out er shell have parasites. Remove the win gs and ba rbed legs before cooking. (2) Drop wor ms into pot able water for at least a half hou r. They will naturally purge themselves. You ca n either cook or e at them raw. (3) Most other inse cts can be eaten raw. Cookin g insects will i mprove their taste. If the thou ght of eating insects is unb earable, grind them into a paste and m ix with oth er foods .

A bas ic fish trap is nothing mor e than a barricade of r ocks or sticks across a stream with another barricade using a funn el-type entrance which fish c an be driven into but have a difficult time finding their way out. Once fish ar e trapped be tween these two b arricades they may be speared, clubbed, or g rabbed. This ca n be very effective when certain types of fish are moving in l arge groups to spawn. This type of trap is very effective in c atching fish. A doo r can be cons tructed at the mouth of th e trap so th at excess fish c an be kept live until n eeded. FISH TRAP 4. FISHING SET LINES . In a survival situ ation, fishing sets are means to ca tch fish whil e working on othe r tasks or weathering out a s torm. Set lines are an effective method of f ishing while conserving energy.

Prior to discu ssing tracking, some basic terms must be und erstood b y all. a. Trails and Runs . In any area, there will b e man y thoroughfares or trails and runs. Some may be seasonal, w hile others ma y be used by many different species. Runs are infrequently or inte rmittently used thorou ghfares that connect trails to specific feeding, beddin g, or watering areas. If trails are like highways connecting cities and towns , runs a re like streets providin g access to the gas stations, sup ermarkets, and neighborhood s. b. Beds and Lays . Beds are frequent ly used sleeping areas commonly referred to a s dens or burrows. Th ese can be found in hollow logs, trees, rock pil es, brush pil es, grass, 13- 1 MSVX.02.14"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"thickets, or e ven out in th e open. A lay is an infrequently used resting or sleeping spot. It is rarely used more th an onc e. c. Rubs . Some rubs a re accidental and some are deliberate. Accidental rubs c an be in a burrow, on a trail, or ove r/und er a fallen tree across a trail. Deliberate rubs can be when an animal scratches a hard-to-reach spot, or when a deer scrapes its a ntlers against a tree to remove its ve lvet. d. Scratches . They also ca n be accidental or deliberate. Accidental scratches are left by animals climbing trees or on a log where it left a belly rub. D eliberate scratches can be found at t he base of tr ees where they have reached up a nd raked their claws downwa rd for any number of re asons. Sc ratches can also be found in th e ground where cats have buried scat, squirrels have cached nut s, or animals are digging at a scent. e. Transference . Transference is the removal of material from one area onto anot her. Transference can occur when walking along a mudd y stream bank and c rossing a log. The mud left on t he log is co nsidered transference. f. Compression . Compression is th e actual flattening of the soil o r snow p ack. It is caused by the pressing down or leveling of soil, s and, stones, twigs, or leaves by the weight of the body. Com pression is more lik ely to be found in fr ozen, h ard, dry, sandy condi tions w here there is no mois ture to hold a clear and lasting imprint. g. Disturbance . Disturbance is the eye-catching effect of unnatu ral patterns. h. Gait . (MSVX .02.14a ) A gait is generally the way an animal moves. Gaits are very critical in th e identification of a nimal tracks. Although certain gaits are more indicative of certain animals, they may (depending on th e circumstanc es) modif y or alter their gait to another style. (1) Diagonal Walker . Normal pattern for all predatory animals, which includes all dogs, cats, and hoof ed animals. (2) Pacers . Nor mal pattern for all wid e-bodied animals su ch as bears, raccoon, opossum, skunk, wolve rine, badger, beaver, porcupine, muskrat, and marmot. Instead of moving oppo site side s of th e bod y at the same time like diagonal walkers, they find it e asier to move both limbs on on e side of the bod y at the same time. 13- 2 MSVX.02.14"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"(3) Bounders .

Normal pattern for rabbits, hares, and rodents ( except wid e-body beaver, muskrat, marmot, and por cupine). As these animals move, they push off wit h their back feet, hi t with the ir front f eet, a nd bring their back feet into position. Tr ee dwelling gallopers will land w ith the ir front feet side by side, while ground d welling gallopers will land with the front f eet at a diagonal. i. Gnaw ing .

Spoor is broken down into two se gments; aerial and gr ound. 13- 4 MSVX.02.14"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"2. Readin g Spoor . Unless a clearly visible ground s poor is readable, interpretations must be made in order to determine “what a nimal made this?” Prior to ev er attempting to r ead spoo r, one must be thoroughly knowl edgeable about wh at animals a re in the area. The first step is to look a t the gait. This will generally narrow down the species. The next step is det ermined which animal family the track belongs to. (MSVX.02.14b ) a. Cat Family . Bobcat, Lynx, and Mountain L ion (Cou gar). 4 toe pads, no vis ible claw print. It moves with a sense of pu rpose and di rect registers its paws.

This infor mation can be used fo r better employment of traps and snares. The following is an example. (a) Walking along a creek bank, y ou notice a set of tracks that have five toe prints for both front a nd back feet with visible claw prints. The information tells y ou the prints belon g to the weasel family. The tracks have a bound ing gait pattern, whi ch eliminat es wide-bodi ed animals such as badger, skunk, porcupine, and wolv erine. Because the tracks are approxima tely the size of a dime, you have eliminated mart en and fisher. The tracks are followin g the stream bank fo r some distance, stoppin g at small holes along the bank’s edge. Knowin g that weasels like grassy meadows, you can determine that the track is p robably made by a mink. 3. Age Determina tion . (MSVX.02.14d ) It is very critical to b e able to determine track age. Each area and climate w ill vary in th e effects of ag ing tracks, so pr actice, experimentation, and expe rience is vital in that area. The following factors deteriorate all tracks and must be factored. a. Weathe r - Last snow or rain, fo g, and dew. b. Sun. c. Wind. d. Soil content - hard, sandy, firm, or moi st. e. Track Erosion . All t racks will er ode over a given period of time. The followin g time table can be used as a g en e r al guideline. (1) Minutes-Top ed ges begin to dry. (2) 24 hou rs-Top e dges begin to e rode.

REQ UIREMEN TS TO MAINTAIN HEA LTH . Maintenance of health is th e first step in preventing injuries. Th e three requirements are: (WSVX.02.15a ) A. WATER (1) A person can not survive without water for more than a few days. Your body loses water through normal body processes (sweating, urinating, and breathing). During norm al activity the kidneys excrete 1 to 2 qu arts of water per day and a person e vaporates . 5 to qua rt per day. Other factors, such a s heat exposure, cold expos ure, intense activity, high altitude, burns, o r illness, can cause y our body to lose more w ater. Water intake is critical in preventing illness. 14- 1 WSVX.02.15"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"B. FOOD (1) The bod y can live several weeks without food. How ever, without an adequate suppl y to stay healthy your mental a nd ph ysical capabilities will d eteriorate rapidly. Food s upplies the bod y with the necessary nutrients and e nergy to survive. (2) Food sou rces are plants, animals, and fis h. (a) Fiber . Fiber prevents ir ritable bowel syndrome. In the Falklands campaign the B ritish ha d a major constipation a nd di arrhea probl em. This was largely caused by dehydration and a low fib er diet. Grasses and pi ne needles are a good s ource of dietary fiber. (b) Vitamins . Vitamins are essential to metaboli c fun ctioni ng of the bod y and c old we ather compounds this fun ction. Our bodies cannot make vitamins so we must provid e them in ou r diet. Most edibl e plant lif e contains many different vit amins . Asso ciated illn esses from long term deficiency are Scurvy (vitamin C) a physical disease and Beriberi (vitamin B1) a mental disease. Vitamins can be found in the c ambium layer of trees, pine needles, and stinging nettle. (c) Minerals . The miner al tha t we are primaril y concerned with is I ron. Iron deficiency causes a 9% decrease in he at energy production. Iron acts as a thermo regulator. Consum ing only 1/3 RD A of iron re sults in a 29% greater heat los s during cold exposur e. Animal blood, dandelions, st inging nettle, and mar row p rovide the major source of iron. Ensur e these foods ar e prop erly prepared. (d) Calories . To p roduc e energy, the bod y uses calories. Prot eins, fats, or carbohydrates produ ce calories. Of th ese three, certain one s produce better energy than others do. Anima l meat is an exce llent sou rce for caloric intake, although nu ts from pinecones can suppl ement it. 1. Protein . Proteins are a reparative food of complic ated molec ules compos ed of chains of amino acids. The re are nume rous kinds of amino acids which cannot be synthesized by the bod y and thus must be consumed in the diet. A pure protein diet can cause fatalities in 3 -8 weeks from Rabbi t St arv a t ion , a term used for living on a r elatively fat free rabbit diet. P rotein can be found in d andelions, nut s, and m eats. 14- 2 WSVX.02.15"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"2. Fat . Fats serve as the main storage form of energy. Fats produce energy and heat. Fats are best obt ained from bone marrow, liv er, or the stomach po rtion of f ish 3. Carbohydrates . Carbohydrates are know n as the qui ck energy food. They produce lots of heat. The y are stored in the liver and muscles. These organs are not large and c an be mark edly depleted by fasting for as short as 24 hour s. Catt ails, nuts are a source for carbohydrates. C. PERSONAL HYGIENE (1) Cleanliness is a n important factor in pr eventing infection an d disease. It becomes even more important in a s urvival situ ation. (2) The areas to pay special attention to a re the feet, hand s, armpits, crotch, an d hair. Visual and ph ysical inspe ctions s hould be conducted daily. Hand a nd finger nails should be kept as clean as possible to prevent infection of mucous m embrane. (a) Soap ( lye) can be mad e from animal fat and ashes. (b) Sun bath (3) Teeth are another important area to keep clean. Br ush your teeth e ach day either with a toothb rush, or if you don't have one, make a chewing stick. (a) A chewing stick is ma de out of a twig about 6 to 8 in ches long. Chew on e end of the stick to separate the fibers. Now you can brush y our teeth. 2. FIVE WAYS THE BODY LOSE S HEAT A. Radiation: is direct heat loss from the body to its surround ings. If the surroundin gs are colder than the body, the net result is heat loss. A nud e man loses about 60% of his tot al bod y heat by radiation. Spe cifically, heat is lost in th e form of infrared radiation. I nfrared targeting devices work by detecting radiant heat loss. B. Conduc tion: is the direct transfer of heat from one object in contact with a c older object. (1) Most commonly conduction o ccurs wh en an indivi dual sits or rests directly upon a c old obj ect, su ch as snow, the ground, or a rock. W ithout an insulating layer between the Marine and th e object (such as an isopo r mat) , one quickly begins to lose h eat. This i s why it's important to not sit or s leep directly on cold ground or snow without a mat or a pack acting as insul ation. C. Convection : is heat loss to the atmosphere or a liquid. Air and wa ter can both be thou ght of a s \"liquids \" runnin g over the surface of the body. Wate r or air, which is in c ontact with the body, attempts to abs orb heat from 14- 3 WSVX.02.15"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"the bod y until the bod y and air or w ater is both th e sam e temper atures. However, if the air or water is continuousl y moving ov er the bod y, the temper atures can never equalize and the body keeps losing heat. D. Evaporation . Heat loss from evaporation oc curs when water (sweat) on th e surface of th e skin is turned into wa ter vapor. This p rocess requires energy in th e form of heat and th is heat comes from the bod y. (1) This is the major method the bod y uses to cool itself down. T his is why you sweat when you work hard or PT. One quart of swe at, which you can easily produce in an hour of hard PT , will take abou t 600 c alories of he at away from the bod y when it e vaporates. E. Respiration. When you inhale, the air you breathe in is w armed by the bod y and saturated with w ater vapor. The n when you exhale, that heat is los t. That is w hy breath c an be seen in c old air. Respiration is really a combination of convection (heat being transferred to moving a ir by the lungs) and evaporation, with both processes oc curring insid e the body. 3. PHYSICAL RESPO NSES TO HEA T . When the body begins to cr eate excess heat, it responds in s everal wa ys to rid itself of that heat. A. Initially, the blood ve ssels in th e skin expand, or di late. This dilation al lows more blood to t he surface where the heat can mor e easily be transferred to the surroundings. B. Soon afterwards, swe ating begins. This c ontributes to h eat loss through convection and e vaporation. 4. PHYSICAL RESPO NSES TO COL D . Almos t the oppos ite occurs as wi th heat. A. First, blood v essels at the skin s urface close dow n, or constrict. This does two things: (1) Less blood g oes near the surface of the body so tha t less heat is lost to th e outsid e. (2) More blood goes to the \"core\" or the center of th e bod y, to keep the brain, heart,lungs, liver, and kidne ys warm. This me ans fin gers and to es tend to g et cold. B. If that is not enough to k eep the body warm, the next step is shiv ering. Shiver ing is reflexive regular muscular c ontractions, this m uscul ar activity causes heat 14- 4 WSVX.02.15"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"production. A s mention ed before, shivering can onl y last for a short time b efore exhaustion occurs. With shivering you will either warm up, a s usu ally occurs, or continue to get colder and start to be come h ypothermic. Hypothermia will be discussed later. 5. ENVIR ONMENTAL INJURI ES (MSVX.02.15b ) A re cold we ather injuries, dehydration, a nd altitude related illnesses. A. COL D WEATHER INJURIES : 1) Hypother mia (MSVX.02.15 c) is the state when the bod y’s core temperature falls to 95 d egrees Fahrenheit or less. It is the numb er one killer of people in a survival s ituation . A comm on belief that extr emely cold temperatures are needed for hypothermia to occur is not true. Most ca ses occur whe n the temperature is between 30 and 50 d egrees Fahrenheit. This is th e normal temperature range at MWTC, exce pt duri ng the harshest of wint er. a) Causes of Hypothermia. The ways in which t he body generates and los es heat has been disc ussed earlier. Quite simpl y, hypothermia occurs when heat loss f rom the bod y exceeds the body's ability to produce heat. Contributing factors include:  Ambient temperature. Outsid e air temper ature.  Wind chill. This only affects improperly clothed individu als.  Wet clothing.  Cold water immersion.  Improper clothin g.  Exhaustion.  Alcohol intoxi cation, ni cotine and dr ugs such as b arbiturates and tranquilizers.  Injuries. Those causing immobilit y or major bleeding, major bu rn and head trauma. b) Signs an d symptoms of H ypothermia  The numbe r one sign to look fo r is altered mental status; that is, th e brain is literally getting cold. Th ese signs might includ e confusion, slurred speech, strange behavior, i rritability, impaired jud gment, hallucinations, or f atigue. 14- 5 WSVX.02.15"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":" As hypothermia w orsens, vi ctims will los e consciousne ss and eventually slip into a coma.  Shive ring. Reme mber that shiv ering is a major w ay the body tries to warm itself early on, a s it fi rst begins to get cold. Shiv ering stops for 2 reasons:  The bod y has warmed back up t o a normal tempe rature range.  The bod y has con tinued to cool. Below 95  F shivering begins to decrease and by 90  F it ceases completely.  Obvious ly, continu ed coolin g is bad. So if a M arine with whom you are working, who was shivering, stops shivering, you must determine if that is because he has warmed up or c ontinued to c ool.  A victim with s evere hypothermia may actually appear to be quite dead, without breathing or a pulse. Howe ver, people who have been found thi s way have b een suc cessfull y \"brought back to lif e\" with no permanent damage. So remembe r, you are n ot de ad until y ou ar e w arm an d de ad . c) Prevention of H ypothermia  Obvious ly, prevention is a lways better (and muc h easier) than treatment.  Cold weather clothin g must be properly warm and ca red for.  Keep your clothin g as dry as possibl e.  If your feet are cold, wear a hat. Up to 80 % of th e bod y's heat can escape from the head.  Avoid d ehydration. D rink 6 - 8 quarts per day.  Eat adequately.  Avoid f atigue and exha ustion.  Increase levels of ac tivity as the temper ature drops. Do not rem ain stationary when the tempe rature is ve ry low. I f the tactical situa tion 14- 6 WSVX.02.15"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"does not permit moving ab out, perform isometri c exe rcises of successive muscles.  Use the buddy system to check each other for signs/symptoms of hypothermia. d) Treatment of Hypothermia .  Make the diagnosis.  Prevent fu rther heat loss.  Remove the victim from the environment (i.e., into a shelter or snow cave).  Insulate the victim.  Rewarm the victim by: *Zip two sl eeping bags together. *Pre-warm the bag by a stripped Marine. *Place the victim in the bag with 2 s tripped Ma rines inside on both sid es of the victim.  Medevac if possibl e. e) Other Points to R emember .  Fluids. If the victim is mildly hypothermic, he may be given hot we ts. Otherwise give him nothin g by mouth.  Avoid, if poss ible, excessive movement of the victim, as his h eart may stop be ating if it is jarred.  Major Wounds. Appl y first aid to ma jor wounds fir st, before attempting to re -warm the victim. Re-warming a victim who ha s bled to death do es little good.  Never give alcohol to h ypothermia victims.  Even after you have started re-warming a victim, he must be cons tantly monitor ed. Don 't forget about him. 2) FROSTBITE Frostbite is the actual freezing of tissues. Whe n in a survival situation, re warming a severe frostbitten area will not help. It is best to w ait fo r rescue and medical a ttention. a) Prevention of F rostbite . Frostbite is a n entirely preventable injury.  Dress in la yers. Keep comfort ably cool. If you begin to become uncomfor table, add layers.  Keep clothes dry. If clothing (especially socks and g loves) become wet, c hange them. This may mean you have to change sock 4-5 times a day. 14- 7 WSVX.02.15"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":" Dress pr operly. If the wind is b lowing, wear the correct protective layer.  Avoid d ehydration. When dehydrated, the amount of blood a vailable to warm your fingers and to es goes down, in creasing the risk of f rostbite.  Avoid Sta rvation. R emember - Food i s Fuel - and the bod y uses that fuel to make heat.  Leadership must ensure that pr eventive measures are taken. b) Signs an d Symptoms of Frostbit e .  Ears, nose, fin gers and to es are affected first.  Areas will feel cold a nd may tingle leading to....  Numbness whic h progresses to...  Waxy appearance wi th skin stiff and un able to glide freely over a joint. c) Treatment of Frostbit e . Frostbite is cl assified into th ree different degrees: Frosting, Super ficial Frostbite, and D eep Frostbite.  Frosting will r evert to no rmal after usin g the techniqu e of body heat rewarming.  Hold th e affected area, skin to skin for 15 minutes . *Rewarm face, nose, and ea rs with h ands. *Rewarm hands in armpit s, groin or belly. *Rewarm feet with mountain budd y’s armpits or belly.  If affected area cannot b e rewarmed in 15 minutes, Superficial Frostbite or Deep Frostbite is susp ected. Do not a ttempt to further rewar m Splint the affected area. Protect the affected area from further injur y. Medevac as soon as possible. DO NOT RUB ANY COLD INJURY WI TH SNOW. Do not ma ssage the a ffected area. Do not r ewarm with stove or fire: a burn i njury may result. Loosen constricting clothing. Avoid tob acco products. d) Treatment of Supe rficial or Deep frostbit e . Any frostbite injury, regardless of severity, is treated the same – evacuate the casualty and re -warming in th e rear. Unless the tactical situation prohi bits evacuation or you are in a survi val situation, no cons i de r at ion s houl d be gi v en to re -w ar ming fr os t bit e in t he fi eld. The reason is somethin g-called freeze – th aw – r e-freeze injury. 14- 8 WSVX.02.15"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":" Freeze – Th aw – Re -freeze injury occurs whe n a frostbitten extr emity is thawed out, then be fore it can heal (which takes weeks and ma ybe months ) it freezes again.

Ke ep the victim warm and dry.  Once in th e rear, a frostbitt en extremity is re-warmed in a water bath, with th e temperature strictly maintain ed at 101  F - 108  F. 3) SNOW BLINDN ESS a. Definition. Sunburn of th e cornea. b. Causes of Snow Blindness. There are two reasons M arines in a wint er mountainous environment ar e at increased risk for snow b lindness.  High altitude. L ess ultraviolet (UTV ) rays are filtered out , UV r ays are what c ause snow blindne ss (as well as sunbu rn). So at altitude, more UV rays are available to c ause dama ge.  Snow. The whit e color of snow reflects much more LTV rays off of the ground a nd back into y our face. c. Signs an d Symptoms of Snow Blindne ss .  Painful eyes.  Hot, s ticky, or gritty sensation in the eyes, like sand in the eyes.  Blurred vision.  Headache may be severe.  Exces sive tearing.  Eye muscle spasm. 14- 9 WSVX.02.15"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":" Bloods hot eyes. d. Prevention of Snow Blindn ess . Prevention is v ery simple. Always wear sunglasses, with UV protection. If sunglasses are not available, then f ield expedient sunglasses can be made from a strip of cardboard with ho rizontal slits, an d charcoal can be appl ied und er the eyes to cut down on r eflection of the sun off th e snow. e. Treatment of Snow Blindness .  Evacuation, when possibl e.  Patch the eyes to prevent any more light reaching them.  Wet compr esses, if it is not too cold, ma y help re lieve some of th e discomfort.  Healing normall y takes two da ys for mild cases or up to a week for more se vere cases. 4) TRENCHFOOT / IM MERSION FOOT a) Definition .

Let your feet dry briefly during the change, and wip e out the inside of th e boot. S ock changes may be required more oft en.  Exerc ise. Cons tant exer cising of the feet whenever the bod y is otherwise immobile will help th e blood flow. e) Treatment of Trench foot/ Immersion F oot .  All cases of t rench foo t must be evacuated. It cannot be treated effectively in the field.  While awaiting evacuation: The feet should b e dried, wa rmed, a nd elevated. The pain is often severe, even thou gh the injur y may appear mild; it may require medic ation such as morphine.  In the rear, the healing of trench foot usually takes at least two months, and may take almost a year. Severe cases may requ ire amputation. Tr e nch foot i s not t o be take n lightly. B. DEH YDRATION 1. Dehyd ration is a deficit of total body water. Dehydration will compound the problems faced in a s urvival situation. De hydration is the second leading cause of all dea ths in a survival s ituation . a) Symptoms . Whe n dehydrated, the followin g signs an d symptoms will a ppear:  Headache and nausea.  Dizziness and f ainting.  Cramps, both abdominal and extr emity. 14- 11 WSVX.02.15"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":" Weakness and l ethargy.  Dark urine wi th a very strong odo r. b) Prevention . Prevention is the key to prevent dehydration. Th e followin g are basic guidelines for the prevention of d ehydration:  Alwa ys drink wa ter when eating. Water is used an d consumed as a part of the digestion p rocess. I f you have plenty of food but no wa ter – Do not e at until a source of w ater can be found.  Conserve energy. Pace yourself.  Drink 6 -8 qu arts of w ater per day when available. In other words, continually drink th rough out th e day. Don’t wait until you are dehydrated.  Monitor the color of your urine.  Don't rely on thirst as an ind icator. 2. H eat related illness es . The fo llowin g illnesses will a ppear from dehydration: 1. Heat syncope . Heat syncope is feinting due to vaso-dilation from the heat. 2. Heat exhaustion . Heat exhaustion occurs when bod y salt losses and dehydration from sweating are so severe that a person c an no l onger maintain ad equate blood pr essure. Heat exhaustion c an lead to h eat stroke. a) Symptoms include; headaches, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, and fainting. 3. Heat stroke . Heat stroke is a failure of th e bod y's coolin g mechanisms that rid the bod y of exc essive heat build up. a) Signs an d symptoms Symptoms are the same as heat exhaustion . Th e signs include delirious o r coma, pinpoint pupils, flush ed skin, sweating may or may not be present. b) Heat cramps .

Dress properly, rest and adequate w ater intak e can help prevent th ese illnesses. C. ALTI TUD E RELATED ILLNESSES: 1. Acute Mountain Si ckness . Acute Mountain Si ckness (AMS) is a self-limiti ng illness due to th e rapid exposure of an unacclimatized indivi dual to hi gh altitude (i.e., helicopter crash on a mountain) . Approxim ately 25% of individu als who ascend rapidly to 8,000 – 9,000 f eet will develop AMS. Virtually, all un- acclimatized persons w ho rapidly ascend to 11,00 – 12,000 fe et will develop AMS. (a) Signs a nd symptoms include; apathy, dizzines s, easily fatigued, nausea, decreased appetite, headache. Ca n be misdia gnosed as dehydration. I f adequate fluid i ntake is maint ained and headache still persists rule out dehydration. 2. HACE . HAC E or High Alti tude C erebral Edema is sw elling of the brain (a) Sign and symptoms are similar to AMS and a ccompani ed by bizar re behavior, hallucinations, c onfusion, and s evere cases – c oma. 3. HAPE . High Altitude Pulmona ry Edema is the fillin g of the lungs with fluid. (a) Signs a nd symptoms include; persistent cough with pink frothy sputum, shortness of breath, d isorientation, f ainting, cool and clammy skin, blu e lips (1) Treatment Descend, Des cend, and Descend. HACE and HAPE can result in death. (2) Prevention Gain elevation slowl y. 10,000 f eet move 1000 f eet per day over 14,000 move no faster than 500 – 1,000 f eet per day. Rest and a cclimatize your body. A. CARBON MONOXIDE POISONI NG 1. Definition. Carbon Monoxide (CO) is a heavy, odorless, colorless, tasteless gas resulting from incomplete c ombustion of fossil fuels. CO kills th rough asphyxia even in th e presence of adequate oxygen, because oxygen-transporting hemoglobin has a 210 t imes greater affinity for CO than for oxygen. Wha t this means is th at CO replaces and takes the place of th e oxygen in the body causing Carbon M onoxi de poi soning. 14- 13 WSVX.02.15"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"2. Signs/S ymptoms. The signs and symptoms depend on t he amount of CO the victim has inhaled. In mild cases, th e victim may have only dizziness, headache, and c onfusion; severe cases can cause a deep coma. Sudden re spiratory arrest may occur. The classic sign of CO poisonin g is cherry-red lip c olor, but t his is usuall y a very late and severe sign, actually the skin is no rmall y found to be pale or blue. CO poisonin g should b e suspected whenever a person in a poor ly ventilated area suddenly collapses. Recognizing this c ondition ma y be difficult whe n all members of the party are affected. 3. Treatment . The first step is to immediately remov e the victim from the contaminat ed area. a) Victims with mild CO po isoning who have not lost cons cious ness need fresh air and l ight duty for a minimum of fou r hour s. If oxygen is available admini ster it. Mor e severely affected victims may require rescue breathing. b) Fortunately, the lungs excrete CO within a few hour s. c) Prevention . Ensu re there is adequate ventilation wh en uti lizing a fire near your shelter. 6. MEDIC AL AID . Unfo rtunately, during a survival situ ation, a corpsman may not a lways be available to r ender assistance. Therefore, the survivo r mus t be knowle dgeable in b asic first aid as taught in the M arine Battle Skil ls Training Handbook. A. Four Life Savin g Steps 1) Start the breathing. 2) Stop the bleeding. 3) Treat the wound. 4) Check fo r shock. B. Bites and stings Reptiles and ins ects of all kinds c an complic ate your survival situation. One of the best methods to reducing this ri sk is to wear your clothin g properly. Do not sc ratch the bite or sting as this can cause the area to become infected. 1) Bee and Was p stings . If stung by a bee, im mediately remove the stin ger and venom sac by scraping it with a fingernail or knife blade. Wa sh the sting site thoroughly. a) Relief for itching and discomfort caused by bites and stings: Cold compress. 14- 14 WSVX.02.15"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"b) A cooling paste of mud and ashes. c) Application of different pl ants. 2) Spider bites . Som e people are extremely allergic to the venom associated with spiders. The spide rs most venom ous in this re gion are the black widow and th e brown re cluse. The black widow is black in c olor with a red hour glass on her belly which has a neurotoxin. The brown recluse h as a fiddle on it 's back w hich has a hemoto xin. 3) Scorpi on stings . Sco rpion stings may lead to r espiratory distr ess. Th ere are scorpions in th e MWTC area. Scor pions th roughout th e world generally have neurotoxins. 4) Snak ebite s . There is a lways the pos sibilit y of snakebite throughout regions in the world. Learning the habitats of th e indi genous snakes of the area you will be operating in will reduce the chance of being bitten. a) Deaths from snakebites are rare, and the primar y concern in treatment is to limit the amount of ev entual tissue destruction ar ound th e bite area. C. Wound s . Wounds are actual breaks in th e integrity of th e skin. Wounds can be caused by accident or by animals. Thes e wounds ar e most serious in a surviv al situ ation, not onl y because of t issue damage and blood loss, but also because of infe ction. B y taking proper care of the wound y ou can reduce the chance of a debilitating infection. D. Animals . Prevention of an a nimal bite is best accompli shed through knowl edge of behavior, p ersonalities, and patterns. 1) Anima ls generally give ample w arning of th eir inte ntions, which are to re pel the intruder or permit its es cape. Animals that act out of c haracter and a pproach huma ns should b e considered rabid and avoided. 2) Tearing, cutting, and cr ushin g injuries are combined in a nimal bites. Alwa ys look fo r secondary injuries. B. First Aid. Whethe r the wound was caused by accident or by animal, the treatment re mains th e same. 1) Early cleansing of the w ound re duces the chance of bacterial infection and is extremely effective in re movin g rabies and oth er viruses. Cleanse by irrigation. B leeding wounds a lso help s the irrigation pro cess initially. 2) Open wound manag ement is best described by the \"open treatment\" method. Do not t ry to suture or close the wound. This will se al any dirt or i nfection into t he wound. As lon g as the wound ca n drain it will usu ally not become life threatening. 14- 15 WSVX.02.15"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"a) Maggots b) Super glue c) Shunt 3) Tourniquet in a su rvival situation .

(WSVX.02.15e ) When handling animals, whether dead or alive, indivi duals mus t use preventive me asures against possibl e expos ure to wildlife diseases. Althou gh the possibilit y of disease is remote, certain signs may indicate that an a nimal may be diseased. Th e following are some of th e more c ommon diseases found in th e Unit ed St ates and throughout the world. A. Hantaviru s Pulmonar y Syndrome . Hantaviru s, or HPS, is a serious respiratory illness that was first recognized in 1993 in an outb reak in Ne w Mexico and Arizona. I t is caused by a virus th at is carried by a common field rodent called the deer mous e. 1) Method of Transmission . The virus is shed in th e droppin gs, urine, and saliva of the deer mouse. The virus is transmitted to hum ans wh en the material dries, becomes airborne and is inh aled. 2) Signs & Symptoms . The dise ase begins with flu -like symptoms 3 to 45 da ys after exposur e. The disease can rapidly progress into a life-threatening lower respiratory illness ch aracterized b y the floodin g of th e lungs with fluid. 3) Treatment . No cu re or vaccine is y et available against inf ection. T he soone r after infection m edical treatment is sou ght, th e better the chance of recovery. 4) Prevention . Mice should not b e handled; ro dent dens should not b e distu rbed. Package food s o that rodents do not c rawl all over it. Do not occupy shelters that ma y have contained ro dents. B. Plague . The cause of p lague is Y e rs ini a pe stis , a bacterium that is m aintained in n ature through a complex flea-rodent cycle. 1) Method of Transmission . Infection in huma ns results b y flea bites, dir ect contact with pl ague-infected rodents, or direct contact wit h affected non- rodent hosts su ch as rabbits, ha res, cats, and o ccasionally other animals. 14- 17 WSVX.02.15"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"2) Signs & Symptoms . Infection in huma ns results in sev ere disease, with a fatality rate of over 50% in unt reated cases. An a bnormal swelling in th e lymph nod es is usually present. 3) Treatment . Infected people must seek medical treatment. 4) Prevention . Animal noted with fl eas should be avoided. I n a survival situation, a killed animal should be immediately submer ged into a cool water sour ce until al l the fleas are remove b y water or have d ied. C. Tick Borne Diseases . 1) Lyme Dise ase . Infection occurs most often between Ma y and Sept ember. In some cases, a c haracteristic skin rash may develop a t the site of the tick bite. Th e rash may expand to a diameter of 5 inch es or more, and t here may be an accompan ying flu-like illness. If left untreated, inf ection c an lead to ch ronic disease characterized by neurologic impairment, cardiac problems, or arthritis. 2) Rocky Mount ain Spot ted Fever . The incubation p eriod in humans is 2- 14 days. Initial symptoms are flu-like and comm only include f ever, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea, and vomit ing. A rash may appear. The fatality rate in cases that are treated with ant ibioti cs is about 5 % and up to 25% t hat are untreated. 3) Treatment . Infected people must seek medical treatment. 4) Prevention . Daily body inspections should b e conducted to r emove a ll ticks. D. Food Bo rne Dise ases . Food bor ne illness, f requently called “food poisonin g,” is acquired by eating food th at is contaminat ed with micr obes or their toxins. Live animals ma y carry the agent, or contamination m ay occur from another source during processing or preparation o f the food. 1) Botul ism . Botuli sm probabl y is the most widely known a nd is ge nerally caused by imprope r storage of meats. Symptoms may begin with vomiti ng and diarrhea but proceed to th e characteristic impair ed vision a nd descending paralysis. Botulism can be fatal. 2) Salmonella . The bacteria are found in the intestinal tracts and feces of a wide range of animals includi ng poult ry, swin e, cattle, and house hold pets. Salmone lla maybe fatal. 14- 18 WSVX.02.15"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"3) Trichinosis . Trichinosis i s caused by a parasite contained within th e muscle ti ssue. Most common carriers are wild sw ine and be ar. Thor ough cooking of meats will destroy the parasite. 4) Tularemia . Disc overed in Tul are County, California. T ularemia has been reported in ov er 45 species of vertebrates; however, the disease most often involv es ticks. I t is als o commonly found in rabbits and ro dents. It is transmittable b y uncooked meats or handling contaminated mea ts with open sores. Tula remia is a life- threatening disease found throughout the world and can onl y be treated wit h antibiotics. 5) Treatment . Consuming c harcoal will aid in reducing the body’s absorption rate. Medical treatment should b e sought if av ailable. 6) Prevention . Pre vention of food bor ne diseases can be accompli shed by: a) Promptly dress game. b) Avoid o r mini mize contamination by gastrointestinal contents. c) Cook f ood thoroughly. Internal cookin g temperatures should b e 165 degrees F or more. d) Eat cooked foods im mediately. e) Store preserved foods p roperly. E. Anima l Scat . Certain parasites found on sc at can inf ect humans, if the scat is handled unprotected. Rac coon R oundwor m can be found in th e scat for at least 30 d ays, while Fox Roundworm will l ast onl y approximately 7 days on th eir scat. Both of th ese parasites can poss ibly infect human, which is a lmost fatal. REFERENCE: 1. FM 21-76, Survival , 1996. 2. Paul S. Auerbach, Wilderness M edicine , 3 rd Edition, 1995. 3. William R.

(MSVX.02.16d ) OUT LINE 1. GENE RAL A. The earth is surrounde d by the a tmospher e, which is d ivided into sev eral layers. The world’s weather systems are in th e tropos phere, the low er of these layers. This l ayer reaches as high as 40,000 f eet. B. Dust and clouds in the atmosphe re absorb or boun ce back much of the energy that the sun beams down upon th e earth. Less than one half of the sun ’s energy actually warms the earth’s surface and lowe r atmosphere. C. Warmed air, combined with t he spinnin g (rotation) of the earth, produces winds th at spread heat and mois ture more ev enly around th e world. This is ve ry important b ecause the sun he ats the Equ ator much more than the poles and without winds to h elp restore the balance, much of the earth would b e impossible to liv e on. Whe n the air-cools; clouds, rain, snow, hail, fo g and frost ma y develop. 15- 1 MSVX.02.16"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"D. The weather that you find in a ny place depends on man y things, i.e. how hot the air is, how m oist the air is, how it is being moved by the wind, a nd es pecially, is it being lifted or not? 2. PRESSURE A. All of t hese factors are related to air pressure, which is th e weight of th e atmosphere at any given place. The lowe r the pressure, the more likely are rain and strong wind s. B. In order to understand this we can say that the air in ou r atmosphere acts very much like a liquid. C. Areas with a h igh level of this liquid w ould exert more pr essure on the Earth and be called a “high pressure area”. D. Areas with a lower level would be c alled a “low p ressure area”. E. In order to equalize th e areas of hig h pressure it would have to push out to the a reas of low p ressure. F. The characteristics of th ese two pressure areas are as follows: (1) High-pressure area . Flows out to e qualize pr essure. (2) Low-pressure area . Flows in to e qualize pressure. G. The air from the high-pressure area is basically just tr ying to gradually flow out to equalize its p ressure with the surroundin g air; whil e the low pressure is beginning to build v ertically. Onc e the low ha s achieved equal pressure, it c an’t stop and continu es to build v ertically; causing turbulence, which results in ba d weather. NOTE : When looking on the weather map, you will notic e that these resemble contour lin es. They are called “isobar s” and are translat ed to me an, “equal pressure area”. H. Isobars . Pressure is m easured in millibars o r another more c ommon measu rement - “inches mercury”. I. Fitting enough, areas of hig h pressure are called “ridges” and a reas of low pr essure are called “troughs”. NO T E : The average air pressure at sea level is: 29.92 in ches mercury. 1,013 milli bars. J. As w e go up in elevation, th e pressure (or weight) of the atmosphe re decreases. EXAMPLE : At 18,000 f eet in e levation it would b e 500 m illibars vice 1,013 millibars a t sea level. 15- 2 MSVX.02.16"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"3. HUMIDITY . Humidit y is the amount of moisture in th e air. All air holds w ater vapor, although it is quit e invisibl e. A. Air can hold only so much water vapor, but th e warmer the air, the more moistur e it can hold. W hen the a ir has all the w ater vapor that it can hold, the air is said t o be saturated (100% relative humidit y). B. If the air is th en cool ed, any excess w ater vapor condenses; that is, it’s mole cules join to build t he water droplets we can see. C. The temperature at whi ch this happens is called the “condensation poin t”. The condensation point v aries de pending on the amount of w ater vapor and the temperature of the air. D. If the air contains a great deal of w ater vapor, condensation wil l form at a temper ature of 20 O C (68 O F). But if the air is rather dry and does not hold much moisture, c ondens ation may not form until th e temperature drops to 0 O C (32 O F) or even b elow fr eezing . E. Adiabatic Lapse Rate . The adiabatic lapse rate is the rate that air will cool on a scent and warm on des cent. Th e rate also varies depending on t he moisture c ontent of th e air. (1) Saturated Air = 2.2 O F per 1,000 fe et. (2) Dry Air = 5.5 O F per 1,000 fe et. 4. WINDS . As we st ated earlier, the uneven heating of the air by the sun and rotation of the earth causes winds . Muc h of the world’s weather depends on a system of winds that bl ow in a set direction. Thi s pattern dep ends on th e different amounts of sun (heat) that the diff erent regions get and also on the rotation of the earth. 15- 3 MSVX.02.16"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"A. Above hot surfaces rising air creates a void. C ool ai r move s into an d settles into th e void. The cool air is either warmed up an d begins to rise or it settles. This i s dependent upon the sun’ s thermal energy. The atmosphere is always trying to equalize bet ween h igh pressure and low pressure. On a l arge scale, this fo rms a circulation o f air from the po les along the surface or the earth to the e quator, where it rises and moves tow ards the poles again. B. Once the rotation of t he earth is added to th is, the patt ern of the circulation b ecomes confusing. C. Because of the heating and cooling, along with the rotation of the earth, we have these surfaces winds. All winds a re named from the direction th ey originated from: (1) Polar Easterlies . These are winds from the polar region moving from the east. Thi s is air that has cool ed and se ttled at the poles. (2) Prevailing Westerli es . These winds originate from approximately 30 de grees North Latitude from the wes t. This is an a rea where prematur ely cooled air, due to the earth’s rotation, has settled back to the surface. (3) Northeast Tradewinds . These are winds that originate from approximately 30 de grees North from the Northeast. Also p rematurely cooled air. D. Jet Stream . A jet stream can be defined as a long, mea ndering current of hi gh speed winds near the tropop ause (transition zone b etween the t roposphere and t he stratosphere) blowin g from generally a westerly direction an d often exce eding 250 mil es per hou r. The jet stream results f rom: (1) Circulation o f air around th e poles and Equ ator. (2) The direction of a ir flow above the mid latitudes. (3) The actual path of th e jet stream comes from the west, dippin g down an d picking up air masses from the tropical regions and going north and br inging down air masses from the polar regions. NOTE : The average number of long w aves in the jet stream is between thr ee and f ive depending on the season. Temperatur e differences between polar and tr opical regions influence this. The long wave s influence day to week changes in the weath er; there are also shor t waves that influence hourly changes in the weather . E. Here are some other types of winds th at are peculiar to mountain environments but don ’t necessarily affect the weather: (1) Anabatic wind . These are winds that blow up mountain valleys to replace warm rising air and are usually light winds. 15- 4 MSVX.02.16"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"(2) Katabatic wind . These are winds that blow down m ountain valley slopes caused by the cooling of air and are occasionally strong wind s. 5. AIR M ASSES . As we know, a ll of th ese patterns move air. This ai r comes in p arcels known as “air mass es”. Thes e air mass es can vary in size f rom as small as a town to as large as a country. These air masses ar e named for whe re they originate: A. Maritime. Over water. B. Continental. Over land. C. Polar. Above 60 de grees North. D. Tropical. Below 60 d egrees North. E. Combining th ese give us th e nam es and description of th e fou r types of air masses: (1) Continental Pola r. Col d, dry air mass. (2) Maritime Pola r. Col d, wet air mass.

As we know, a ir can onl y hold so muc h moistur e dependin g on it’ s temperature. If we cool this a ir beyond its saturation point, it must release this moi sture in one form or another, i.e. rain, snow, fo g, dew, etc. The re are three ways that air can be lifted and c ooled be yond its saturation point. A. Orographic uplift . Thi s happens whe n an air mass is push ed up and ov er a mass of hi gher ground su ch as a mountain. Due to the adiabatic lapse rate, the air is cooled with a ltitude and if it reaches its saturation point we will re ceive precipitation. OROGRAPHIC UPLIFT B. Convention eff ects . Thi s is nor mally a summer effect due to t he sun’s heat radiating off of the surface and causing the air currents to pus h straight up a nd lift ai r to a point of saturation. 15- 6 MSVX.02.16"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"CONVECTION EFFECTS C. Frontal liftin g . As we know w hen two air masses of dif ferent moisture a nd temperature content collide, we have a front. Sinc e the air masses will not mix, the warmer air is forced aloft, from there it is cooled and then reaches its saturation point. F rontal lifting is where we receive the majori ty of our precipitation. A combination of th e different types of lifting is not uncommon. 7. CLO UDS . Anytime air is lifted or cooled beyond its saturation point (100% relative humidit y), clouds are formed. Clouds are one of our sign posts to what is happening. Clouds can be described in many different ways, they can also be classified by height or appearance, or even by the amount of a rea covered, vertically or horizontall y. (MSVX.02.16b ) A. Cirrus . These clouds are formed of ice crystals at very high altitudes (us ually 20,000 to 35,000 f eet) in th e mid- latitude s and a re thin, f eathery type clouds . These clouds can give you up to 24 hou rs warning of approaching bad weather, hundr eds of miles in advance of a warm front. Fr ail, scattered types, such as “mar e-tails” or dense cirrus layers, tufts a re a sign of fair weather but p redictive may be a prelude to approaching lowe r clouds , the arrival of p recipitation a nd th e front. B. Cumulus . These clouds are formed due to rising air currents and a re prevalent in uns table air that favors vertical developme nt. These currents of air create cumilifor m clouds that give them a piled or bun ched up a ppearance, lookin g simila r to cotton balls. W ithin the cumulus family there are three diffe rent types to he lp us to forecast the weather: (1) Cotton puffs of c umulus are Fair Weathe r Clouds but should b e obs erved for possible growth into tow ering cumulus and cumuloni mbus. (2) Towering cumulus are characterized by vertical developme nt. Their vertical lifting is caused by some type of lifting action, s uch as convective currents found on hot sum mer afternoons or when wind is fo rced to rise up th e slop e of a mountain or possibly the liftin g action th at ma y be present in a f rontal system. Th e tow ering cumulus has a puffy and “c auliflower-shaped” appearance. 15- 7 MSVX.02.16"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"(3) Cumuloni mbus clouds are characterized in the same ma nner a s the tow ering cumulus , form the familiar “ thund erhead” and produ ce thund erstorm activity. These clouds are characterized b y violent upd rafts which carry the tops of th e clouds to extreme elevations. Tor nadoes, hail and severe rainstorms are all products of this type of cloud. At t he top of the cloud, a flat anvi l shaped form appears as the thund erstorm begins to dissipate. C. Stratus . Stratus clouds ar e formed when a layer of mois t air is co oled below its s aturation point. S tratiform, clouds lie mostly in hori zontal layers or sheets, resisting vertical developme nt. The word stratus is derived from the Latin word “layer”. The stratus cloud is quit e unifo rm and re sembles fo g. It has a fairly uniform base and a dull, g ray appearance. St ratus clouds make th e sky appear heavy and wi ll occasion ally produce fine drizzle or very light snow with fog. However, because there is little o r no ve rtical move ment in th e stratus clouds , they usua lly do not produce precipitation in th e form of heavy rain or snow . 7. FRONT S . As w e know , fronts often happen whe n two a ir masses of different mois ture and temperature content in teract. One of the ways we can identify that this is happening is by the progression of th e clouds. (MSVX.02.16a ) A. Warm Front . A w arm front o ccurs when warm air move s into a nd ov er a slow er (or stationary) cold air mass. Sinc e warm air is less dense, it will r ise naturally so th at it will push the cooler air down an d rise abov e it. The cloud y ou will see at this st age is cirrus. From the point where it actually starts rising, you will s ee stratus. As it co ntinue s to ris e, this wa rm air cools by the cold a ir and, this, r eceiving moisture a t the sam e time. As it builds in moisture, it darkens becoming “nimbus -stratus”, which means r ain of thund erclouds. At th at point some type of mois ture will g enerally fall. 15- 8 MSVX.02.16"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"B. Cold Front . A c old front occurs wh en a cold air mass (colder than the ground th at it is traveling over) overtakes a warm air mass that is stationary or moving slowl y. This cold air, being denser, will go underneath the warm air, pushi ng it higher. Of c ourse, no on e can see this, but th ey can see clouds and th e clouds th emselves can tell us what is happening. The cloud pr ogression to look for i s cirrus to cirrocumulus to cumulus and, finally, to cumuloni mbus. C. Occluded Front . Cold fronts move faster than wa rm ones so th at eventually a cold front overtakes a warm one and the warm air becomes progressively lifted f rom the surface. The zone of division b etween cold air ahead and col d air behind is called a “cold occlusion”. If the air behind the front is w armer than ahead, it is a warm occlusion. Most land ar eas expe rience more occlusions th an other types of fronts. I n the progression of clouds l eading to fronts , orographic uplif t can play part in de ceiving you of th e actual type of front, i .e. progression of clouds leading to a w arm front wi th orographic cumulus clouds added to th ese. The progression of c louds in an occlusion is a combinati on of both p rogressions f rom a warm and c old front. 8. USING SIGNS FROM NATURE . (MSVX .02.16 c) These signs will give you a general prediction of th e incoming we ather conditions. Try to utili ze as many signs together as possible, which will improve y our prediction. All of these signs ha ve been tested with relative accuracy, but shouldn’ t be depended on 100%. B ut in any case you will b e right more times than wrong in pr edicting the weather. From this we c an gather as much information as needed and compile it along with ou r own exper ience of th e area we are working in to h elp us form a prediction of inc oming we ather. The signs are as follows: A. Contrail Lines. A b asic way of identifying a low-pressure area is to not e the contrail lines from jet aircraft. If they don’t dissip ate within t wo hou rs, that indicates a low pr essure area in your area. This usu ally occurs about 24 hou rs prior to an onc oming front. B. Lenticulars. These are optical, lens-shaped c umulus clouds that have been sculpte d by the winds. Thi s indicates moisture i n the air and high winds aloft. W hen preceding a cold front, winds and c louds will b egin to low er. 15- 9 MSVX.02.16"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"C.

When the smoke from a campfir e, after liftin g a short distance with the heated air, beats downwa rd, a storm is app roaching. Steadily rising smoke indi cates fair weather. I. A gray, overcast evening sky indicates that moisture c arrying dust p articles in the atmosphere have become overloaded with water; this c ondition f avors rain. J. A gray mornin g sky indicates dry air above the haze caused by the collecting of moisture on th e dust in the lower atmosphere; you can reasonably expec t a fair day. K. When the setting sun s hows a green tint at the top a s it sinks be hind clear horizon, fair weather is probable for most of th e next 24 hou rs. L. A rainbow in the late afternoon indi cates fair weather ahead. Howe ver, a rainbow in the mornin g is a sign of p rolonged bad weather. M. A corona is the circle that appears around t he sun or the moon. When this c ircle grows larger and larger, it indi cates that the drops of water in th e atmospher e are evaporating and that the weather will pr obably be clear. Whe n this c ircle shrinks b y the hour, it indicates that the water drops in th e atmosphere are becoming l arger, forming into c louds, rain is almost sure to fall. N. In the northern hemisphere winds fo rm the south usuall y indicate a low-pressure system. These systems ar e frequently associated with r ainstorms. “Winds from the south bring s rain in it’ s mouth.” O. It is so qui et before a storm, that distant no ises can be heard more c learly. This is due to the inactivity of wildlife a coupl e of hours before a storm. P. Natural springs tend to flow at a higher rate when a storm is approaching. This is due to lower baromet ric pressure. This will cause ponds , with a lot of v egetative decay at the bottom, to become momentaril y pollut ed. Q. A heavy dew or frost in the morning is a sign of fair weather for the rest of th e day.

The Code of Conduct provides guiding principles to M arines invo lved in an y military operation wh ether peacekeeping, combat, or survival. An ope ration that deteriorates so severely that a Marine unit i s forced to emplo y survival skills may require that unit to “ evade” hostile enemy units. JP 3-50.3 d efines ev asion as the process whe reby indivi duals who a re isolated in host ile or unfriendly territory avoid capture with the goal of successfull y returning to areas under friendly control. S hould a survival situation r equire evading the enemy, success will depend on prior planning. a. Plannin g and P reparation . (MSVX.2.16a ) The responsibility for proper preparation and pl anning for evasion ultimately rests with th e individuals con cerned. All Marines who ar e tasked to exe cute any mission should r eceive the followin g: (1) Intelligence Briefings . Information on th e mis sion route, enemy troop disposi tions, impact of enemy operations on f riendly or mult inational militar y forces, sta tus of the US or multinational mil itary situation, o r changing attitudes of the enemy popul ace. 16- 1 MSVX.02.17 "},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"(2) Evasion Plan of A ction (EP A) . The EPA is one of the critical documents for successful r ecovery plannin g. It is the vehicle by which pot ential evaders, prior to their isolation in hostil e territory, relay their after-isolation int entions to the recovery forces. See Appendix D, “Evasion P lan of Ac tion F ormat,” fo r details on th e content of an E PA. (3) Selected Areas for Evasion (SAF E) Area Intelligence Descriptions . (MSVX.2.16b ) A SAFE is a “designated area in hostil e territory that of fers isolated personne l a reasonable chance of avoidin g capture and of surviving until they can be recovered.” (a) They are designated by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and are classified.

Apply the key word survival (ICBT – 20.01) ( PVTX.14.16 ) 1. Size up the situation:  Mission What was the mission? Can the miss ion still b e accomplished?  Enemy What is the enemy situation?  Troops and Fire Support available Do you have communications w ith higher? Is anyone injur ed? How will they be transpor ted? How will you communi cate with o ther Marines in your group? Arm and Ha nd signals?  Terrain and Weather Do you have a map? Does the terrain offer cover and con cealment? Where is the wat er? Do you have protection from the elements? Is it advantageous to move in current weather? Will you move in daytime or evening temper atures? How much illumination is available at night?  Time, Space, and Logistics Is it day or night? Time Distance Formula What kind of suppli es and equi pment ar e available? 2. Undue haste makes waste:  Should you stay or move from your current pos ition. APPENDIX-E 1"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":" “ Slow is Smooth – Smooth is Fast” i.e. Is there a need to r un to th e SAFE or should the requirements of survival be imple mented in route? Security is paramount -is it b eing sacrificed for speed? 3. Remember where you are:  Are you in a non-permissive environment?  What is the terrain lik e?  Can you utilize land navigation skill s? 4. Vanquish fear and panic:  Are good decisions b eing made?  Is the group c omplet ely lost and l eaderless?  BAMCIS 5. Improvise and improve:  Do you have your survival ki t?  Are litters available or do you have to improvise?  Do you have the r esources to obt ain food a nd wat er?  Will your suppli es an d equipment protect you from the elements?  Will your suppli es an d equipment protect you from the enemy? 6. Value livi ng:  Do you want to lay on your back and put y our legs in th e air like a dead cockroach? 7. Act like the natives:  Observe native habits. 8. Live by your wits, but for now learn basic skills:  Utilize common sense a nd basic Marine Corps t raining.  Practice skills l earned at MWTC .  Prior planning prevents poor perf ormance.  Establish E a nd R plan, bri ef personnel of cont ingencies. B. Additional Individual Training Standards :  Emplo y signaling devices (ICBT – 20.03)  Construct a nd maintain a fire (ICBT – 20.04 )  What is the tactical situation?  Prepare a survival kit (ICBT 20.05) (PVTX.14.15 )  Maintain th e M16A2 service rifle.

Obviously, every effort must be made to accomplish the mission. If it can not b e accomplished a separate mission order mus t be establishe d for the group. ( i.e. At 0900 the group wil l impleme nt the requirements fo r survival in order to move to th e SAFE for recovery.) In order to tactically move and occupy the SAFE, the group mus t be task organized into te ams. The teams are assigned addition al tasks. T eam tasks will usually be accomplished during occupati on of th e patrol base. In addition, individu als within the group ar e assigned tasks. 1. Teams:  Security. All p atrol membe rs should be assigned sectors of fi re to include air sentry.  Reconnaissance.  Assault. (may not b e implemented)  Suppor t. (ma y not be imple mented) 2. Team Tasks:  Water procurement.  Food g athering.  Wood gathering. (construction m aterials, signal, and fire wood. )  Shelt er construction.  Pathguards.  Signaling 3. Individual Tasks:  Point man.  Navigator.  Patrol leader and assistant. APPENDIX-E 3"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":" Flank (l eft and right) security.  Two p ace men.  Tail end ch arlie. In a survival situation it is p robably wiser to o ccupy the patrol base throu gh reconnaissance instead of by force. Upon initi al occupation the acronym SAFE (Security, Automatic we apons , Fields of fi re, Entrenchment) must be enforced. The patrol base should onl y be entered (or exited ) from one location. Communication within th e group is es sential. Eve ryone must be well info rmed. (i.e. current plans, alternate patrol bases or rally point s, how ma ny Marines have departed the patrol base and w hen are they expec ted to r eturn, current challenge and p ass, and ne ar and fa r recognition signals.) N o Ma rine will exer cise their judgement and leave the patrol base or perform a task wit hout permiss ion from the patrol leader. The patrol base is not a pl ace for lollygagging. It is a pl ace where noise and light discipl ine is enforced and security is maintain ed co ntinuousl y. Prio rities of work will b e established a fter occupation. ( i.e. weapon maint enance, hygiene, chow, and r est plans) Sec urity or reconnaissance teams can be sent out to determine enemy threat or gather information for route selection. These patrols can also be tasked with gathering firewood o r some other routine task. H owever, security must be maint ained whil e the firewood is being collected. Since you are probably evading the enemy, activity in and around th e patrol base must be limited. Occupation o f the patrol base must not exc eed 24 hou rs. Depending on th e tactical situa tion th e use of fir e may or may not be appropriate. D. Conclusion: The abov e information servers as a guideline. Surviv al is a thinki ng person’s challenge between life and death. As the s ituation changes a Marine must adapt, size up th e situation, an d imple ment a new plan in order to survi ve. If you are lacking in any of the Individual Training Stand ards it is y our responsibl e to take corrective action. Remember that every Marine is a basic rifleman.
