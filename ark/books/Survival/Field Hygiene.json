Message To The Unit Commander DISEASES AND NONBATTLE INJURIES What action do you think should be taken against a com- mander who allows his unit to sustain 40% combat injuries through neglect? How about a commander with a unit 40% ineffective due to malaria, cold injuries, or diarrhea? Historically, in every conflict the US has been involved in, only 20% of all hospital admissions have been from combat injuries, The other 80% have been from diseases and nonbattle injuries (DNBI). Excluded from these figures are vast numbers of soldiers with decreased combat effectiveness due to DNBI not serious enough for hospital admission. Preventive medicine measures are simple, commonsense ac- tions that any soldier can perform and every leader must know. The application of PMM can significantly reduce time loss due to DNBI. 1"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" • • • 2 How Much Time Does Your Unit Spend Training Soldiers on: Disease and Nonbattle Injury Prevention?

The medical threat faced by the Marauders in the jungles of Burma was great. Everyone was sick, but some had to stay and fight. Evacuation was limited to those with high fever and severe illness. One entire platoon cut the seats from their pants because severe diarrhea had to be relieved during gunfights.

(Remember Togatabu Island and the jungles of Burma?) To answer this need the field sanitation team (FST) concept was developed. Selected members from each company-sized unit were designated to receive special training in DNBI prevention so they could advise the commander in PMM for DNBI. This training enabled the unit commander to provide for control of insects, proper disinfection of water, and safe food supplies. As a result of using field sanitation teams, commanders were able to reduce losses due to DNBI. 69"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" • • • • • • • • 70 FIELD SANITATION TEAM TASKS Today’s unit field sanitation teams serves as advisors to the commander concerning those PMM that should be taken by in- dividuals and the unit to prevent DNBI.
