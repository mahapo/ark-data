(WSVX.02.01b) An y event can lead to stress . Of ten, stressful events occur simult aneous ly. Th ese events are not stres s, but they produ ce it and are called “stressor s”. In respons e to a stresso r, the bod y prepares either to “fight or flee”. Str esso rs add up. Anticip atin g stressors and developi ng strategies to cop e with them are the two ingredients in the eff ectiv e mana gem ent of stress. It is essenti al that the survivo r be aw are of the types of stressors he wil l encount er. a. Injury, Illness, or De ath . Injury, illne ss, and death are real possibili ties a survivo r has to face. Perhaps nothin g is more stressful than being alone in an unfamil iar envi ronment wh ere you could di e f rom hosti le action, an accident, o r from eating som ethi ng l eth al. b. Un certaint y and Lack of Contro l. The onl y guarantee in a surviv al situ ation is tha t nothin g is guaranteed. This uncertaint y and lack of cont rol also add to the stress of bein g ill, inju red, or kill ed. c. Envir onm ent . A survivo r will have to conte nd with the stressor s of we athe r, terrain, and the variety of creatures inhabitin g an area. Heat, col d, rain, winds, snow, mountains, ins ects, and animals are jus t a few of th e c hallenges a wa iting the M arine wo rking to s urviv e. d. Hunger and Thirst . Withou t food and water a person will weaken and eventu ally die. Gettin g and prese rvin g food and water takes on inc reasin g importan ce as the length of time in a surviv al settin g increases. Wi th the increase d lik elihood of diarrh ea, repleni shin g electrolytes becom es critical. Fo r a Marine used to havin g his prov isions issued, foraging can be a big sou rce of s tress. e. Fatigue . It is essent ial that survivo rs em ploy all availabl e means to preserve mental and physical strength. While food, water, and other energy build ers ma y be in sho rt supp ly, maxi mizing sleep to avoi d deprivation is a very control lable facto r. Further, sleep depriv ation di rectly correlates with inc reased f ear. 01- 4 WSVX 02.01"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"f. Isolation .

T hese ar e some of the ma jor inte rnal r eaction s y ou might expe rienc e wi th th e su rviv al str essors. a. Fear . Fear is our emotional respon se to dangerous circum stances that we believe have the pot enti al to caus e death, injur y, or illn ess . Fear can have a positiv e func tion if it encourages us to be cautious in s ituat ions wh ere reckless ness co uld result i n i nju ry. b. Anxiet y . Anxiet y can be an uneasy, apprehensiv e feelin g we get when faced with dang erous situations . A survivor reduces his anxi ety by performing those tasks that will ensure his coming t hrough t he ordeal c. Ang er and Frust ration . Frust ration arises whe n a person is cont inua lly thw arted in his attempts to reach a goal. On e out grow th of frust ration is anger. Gettin g lost, dam aged or forgotten equi pm ent, the weather, inhospita ble terrain, enem y patrols, and physical limit ations are just a few sources of frust ration and anger. Frus tration and anger encourage, irration al b ehavior, poo rly thou ght-out decisions, a nd, in som e inst ances , an “ I qu it” attitud e. d. De pression . Depression is clos ely link ed with frus tration and anger whe n faced with the privations of surviv al. A destructiv e cycle bet ween anger and frustration conti nues unt il the person becomes wo rn down- physically, emotionall y, and me ntally. At this point, he starts to give up, a nd his fo cus shifts f rom “What c an I do ” to “ There is not hin g I ca n do. ” e. Loneliness and Boredom . Ma n is a soc ial animal and enjo ys the com pany of others. Loneliness and boredom can be anoth er sou rce of depression. Ma rin es must find ways to keep th eir minds produ ctiv ely occupi ed. f. Guilt . Th e circums tan ces leadi ng to your surviv al setting are som etime s drama tic and tragic. It may be the result of an accident or mil itar y mission where there wa s a los s of life. Perhaps you were the onl y, or one of a few, survivo rs. While natu rally relieved to be alive, you simultane ous ly ma y be mourning the deaths of others that were less fortun ate. Do not let guilt feelin gs preven t y ou from living . 5. PRIORITIES OF WORK IN A S URVIVAL SITUATION.

The envi ronment may sometimes provide you with oppor tunitie s to a cquire water. In a cold we ather mount ainous re gion water can generally be located in th e followin g: (1) Snow . Snow can be melted fo r potable water. Melting snow wil l result in a higher fuel usage. Uncontaminated s now doe s not need to b e disinfected. (2) Ice . (WSVX.02.03a ) Ice can be melted fo r potable water. Melting ice is preferable to m elting snow due to the higher concentration of w ater per volume. How ever, since ice is froz en water it needs to b e disinfected. (3) Streams and Rivers . Stre ams and rivers can generally be found in a mountainous region. Extreme caution must be used wh en ap proaching the edge to avoi d accidental cold-water submersion. (4) Sea Ice . In time, sea ice loses its s alinit y. You c an identify this i ce by its rounded co rners and bl uish color. G ray ice has not yet lost its s alt content. b. Th e followin g are some general considerations when us ing snow an d ice for water. (1) Never melt snow or ice inside your mouth. This removes bod y heat and increases the chance of cold w eather injuries. 03- 2 WSVX.02.03"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"(2) When on the move, use bod y heat to melt snow. Pla ce snow o r ice in a w ater bag and pl ace the bag between y our layers of clothing, not directly on the skin. (3) Do not was te fuel to melt snow or ice when drinkable water (i.e., stream) is available. (4) If melting snow in a container by a fire, utili ze a hot ro ck to sp eed up th e process and conserving fuel. 3. HAZARD OUS FLUIDS (WSVX.02.03b ) a. Survivors have occasionally attempted to au gment the ir water suppl y with other fluids such as; alcoholi c beverages, urine, blood, o r seawater. Wh ile it is true that each of these fluids ha ve high water content, the impurities th ey contain require the body to expend m ore fluid to pu rify them. (1) Seawater . Seawater in more th an mini mal quantitie s is ac tually toxic. The concentration of sodium and ma gnesium salts in it is so high that fluid must be drawn from the body to eliminate th e salts an d eventually the kidn eys cease to function. (2) Alcohol . Dr inking alcoholic liquids will dehydrate the body, reduce bod y heat, and cloud jud gment. Ingesting a super-cooled liqui d can cause immediate f rostbit e of the throat and possibl e death. (3) Blood . Blood i s consid ered a food. D rinkin g blood w ill require your body to expend additional fluid in ord er to digest it. (4) Urine . Dr inking urine is foolish. Ur ine is nothi ng more th an bod y waste. Drinking urine returns wa ste into y our body and requires more fluid to expel it. 4. WATER QUALITY . Water contains minerals, toxins, and pathogens. If consumed in large enough quantiti es these may be harmful to human h ealth. Patho gens are our primary concern. Patho gens are divid ed into V irus, Cysts, Bacteria, and P arasites. Certain pathogens are more resistant to c hemicals and s mall enough to move through m icroscopic holes in e quipment (i.e., T- shirt, parachute). Cer tain pathogens also ha ve the abil ity to sur vive in ext remely cold w ater temperatures. Water quality is divid ed into th ree levels of safety.

FIRES . Fires fall into two m ain ca tegories: those built for cookin g and t hose built for warmth and s ignaling. The basic steps are the same for both: preparing the fire lay, gathering fuel, bui lding the fire, and pr operly extinguishing the fire. a. Preparing the fire lay . There are two t ypes of fire lays: fire pit and Dakota hole. Fire pits ar e prob ably the most common. (1) Without a platform in th e snow, th e fire will sink. C reate a platform as follows: (a) Lay several green logs side by side for the size of your fire. (b) Build your fire on top of t he platform or, (c) Dig down to the earth and s tart fire. (d) Create a windb reak if pos sible. (e) Avoid us ing wet rocks. H eat acting on th e dampne ss in s andstone, shale, and s tones from streams may cause them to explode. (2) Dakota Hole . (WSV.02.05a) The Dakota Hole is a tactical fire lay. Although no fire is 100 % tactical. (a) Reduces the signature of th e fire by placing it below g round. (b) By creating a large air draft, the fire will burn with less smoke than the fire pit. (c) It is easier to lig ht in high wind s. WSVX.02.04 04- 11"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"DAKATA HOLE b. Gather Fuel . Ma ny Marines take shortcuts wh en gathering firewood. T aking a few extra minutes can mean th e diff erence between ease and frustration when buildin g a fire. (1) Tinder . Tind er is the init ial fuel. It should b e fine and dry. Gather a doubl e handful of t inder for the fire to b e built and an extra doubl e handful to b e stored in a dry place for the followin g morning. Dew can moisten tinder enough to make li ghting the fire diffic ult. Some examples of tind er are: (a) Shredded ce dar/juniper bark, pin e needles. (b) Slivers shaved from a dry stick. (c) Natural fibers from equipment suppl emented w ith pin e pitch (i.e., cotton b attle dressing). (d) Cotton balls an d petroleum jelly or Char-cloth. WSVX.02.04 04- 12"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"(2) Kindlin g . Thi s is the material that is ignited by the tind er that will burn l ong enough to ignite the fuel. (a) Small sticks/twi gs pencil-thick up to t he thickness of th e thumb. Ensure that they are dry. (b) Due to a typically large resin content, e vergreen limbs often make the best kindli ng. T hey burn hot and fast, but t ypically do not la st long. (3) Fuel Wood . Fuel Wood is used to keep the blaze going long enough to fulfill its pu rpose . Ideally, it should bu rn slow enough to conserve the woodpil e, make plenty of heat, and leave an ample supply of long-lasting coals. (a) Firewood br oken from the dead limbs of standin g trees or windfalls held off the ground will have absorbed less moi sture a nd the refore should bur n easily. (b) Refrain from cutting down liv e, green trees. (c) Softwoods (evergreens and coni fers) wil l burn hot a nd fast with lots of smoke and spark, leaving little in th e way of coals. Hardwoods (broad leaf trees) will burn s lower with l ess smoke and leave a good bed of coals. (d) Learn the woods indi genous to the area. Birch, dog wood, a nd m aple are exce llent fuels. Osage orange, ironwood, an d manzanita, thou gh difficult to b reak up, make t errific coals. Aspen and cott onwood bu rn clean but l eave little coals. (e) Stack your wood s upply close enough to be handy, but far enough from the flames to be safe. Prote ct your suppl y from addition al precipitation. (f) If you happen to go down in a n aircraft that has remaine d intact, a mixture of g as and oil m ay be used. Us e caution when igniting this mixture. c. Building the Fire . The type of fire built will b e dependent upon its int ended us e, either cooking, heating, or signaling. (1) Cooking Fires . Cookin g fires are used to c ook food a nd boil w ater. (a) Teepee Fire . The teepee fire is used to produce a concentrated heat source, primaril y for cooki ng. Once a good s upply of coals can be seen, coll apse the teepee and pus h ember s into a compact bed.

Othe r designs ma y have magn esium mixed into t he flint to p roduce a higher quality of spark. (2) Primitive Methods . Primitive fire methods are those developed by early man. There are numerous t echniqu es that fall into this c ategory. The only method that wil l be taught at MCMWTC is the Bow & Drill. WSVX.02.04 04- 14"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"(3) Bow & Drill . (WSV.02.05b ) The techniqu e of s tarting a fire with a bow & drill is a true field expedi ent fire starting method, w hich requires a piece of cord and knif e from your survival kit to construct. The compone nts of the bow & drill are bow, drill, socket, fire board, embe r patch, and bird’s nest. (a) Bow . The bow is a resilient, g reen stick ab out 3/4 of an inch in diameter and 30-36 in ches in length. Th e bows tring can be any type of cord, howe ver, 550 co rd works best. Ti e the string from one end of the bow to th e other, without a ny slack. (b) Drill . The drill should be a straight , seasoned ha rdwood stic k about 1/2 to 3/ 4 of an inch in di amete r and 8 t o 12 in ches in length. T he top end is tapered to a blunt point to r educe friction g enerated in the socket. Th e bottom end is s lightly rounded to fit snugly into th e depression on the f ireboard. (c) Socket . The socket is an easily grasped stone or piece of h ardwood o r bone with a slight depression on on e side. Us e it to hol d the drill in place and t o apply downward pressure. (d) Fire board .

POSITIVE LEAD ERSHIP A ND THE RIG HT ATTITUDE . Leadership must be by example. At first, harsh and unf amiliar c onditi ons tend to b e frightening. Marines will find themselves up against man y challenges they have never met before and the environment will constantly remind them that they can become a casualty if the y make m istakes. Ag gressive leadership, whi ch consis tently meets an d overcomes the challenges of th e envi ronme nt, is essential to mission accomplish ment. There will be two enemies to c ontend with: th e enemy soldier and the environment itself. T he first step tow ards de feating these enemies is getting your Marines in th e right mental a ttitude. Th e leader must maintain a pos itive attitude towards the mission, his Ma rines, and the equi pment th ey have to carry out t he job. Y ou can be defeated psychologically, if you are not aware of the symptoms of a poor ly motivated uni t. a. Core Values applied in a survi val situation . Cor e value are very applicable to leadership in a survival situation. In the absence of con stant adherence to our core values, subordinate Marines ma y suffer the consequences of injury and in extr eme cases, DEATH. b. Honor . Honor is int egrity, responsibilit y, and accountabilit y. Without hono r in this type of environment, decisions are made with inaccurate and/or mislea ding information. D ishono rable actions or intentions ulti mately lead to un ethical behavior...t rust be tween Marines wil l erode, dependability will become unimportant, and the resultin g consequences to energy conservation wi ll greatly affect a unit’s cohesion and a bility to ac complish its mis sion. c. Courage . Courage is doing the right thing for the right reason. C ourage in this type of environme nt for small unit leaders to take charge of their unit . The added stress and pressure indu ced in mount ainous t errain makes th e tough decisions even tou gher to 05- 1 WSVX.01.02"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"make: courag eous leade rs take that extra step. Trust and conf idence in leadership is built upon t horough training to ensure their men are capable of overcoming the fear and un certainty of enemy and th e harsh environment. A few examples of cou rage are: (1) Ensuring Marines have the proper clothing on f or the task th ey are performing. (2) Ensuri ng Marines are maintaining security, regardless of we ather cond itions. (3) Preventing lethargy and laziness f rom affecting decision m aking skills. (4) Rising to th e challenges of a h arsh env ironme nt, and b eating the cold weather with solid l eadership. d. Commitment . Commitment is devotion to the Corps and your fellow M arines. Without commitment, unit c ohesion wil l break down. M arines must know that their safety and w ell-being rests upon o thers. Likewise, Marines must provid e the same safety and w ell-being for themselves and ot hers. Onl y through this t ype of commitment will a unit su ccessfully accomplish it mission. 2. LEADERSHIP CHALL ENGES PECUL IAR TO MOUNTAIN OPER ATIONS Althou gh most leadership challenges in a t empe rate environment ar e the same in cold we ather, some problems will arise which must be quickly corrected. a. Cocoon-like Existence . Ma ny men, when bundl ed up in s uccessive layers of cl othin g and wit h their head covered by a hood, t end to withdraw within th emselves a nd to assume a “cocoon-like existenc e”. When so clot hed, the indi vidual's hearing and field of vision are greatly restricted and he tends to b ecome oblivious to his surroundings. His mental f aculties become sluggish and althou gh he looks, h e doe s not se e. Leaders must recognize and ov ercome these symptoms. Addit ionally, the leader needs to w atch for the growth of lethargy within himself and must be alert to prevent it. He must always appear alert to his men and prevent them from sinkin g into a state of co coon-like exis tence. (1) If your Marines wit hdraw into a shell or become mood y and d epressed, ge t them involv ed in c onversations with ea ch oth er. (2) Don’ t accept an excuse for not carrying out a n order. Cold weather training all too o ften be comes a camping trip. Leadership must challenge their Marines to train as they would fi ght. (3) If Marines still displ ay a “Cocoon- like” existence, have them engage in physical activity. b. Individual a nd Group Hib ernation . Thi s problem is similar i n manifestation o f withd rawal f rom the env ironme nt. It is generally recognized by a tendency of indivi duals to se ek the comfort of sleeping bags, and b y the group rem aining in tents or other shelter at the neglect of th eir duties. In extreme cases, guard and security WSVX.01.02 05- 2"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"measures ma y be jeopardized. Many times, it is the leadership that violates this, thus destroying the unit’s trust and conf idence. (1) The leader must ensure that all personn el remain alert and active. Ridged insist ence upon p roper execution of all military duties and the prompt and proper performanc e of the many group “chores” is e ssential. (2) Be alert for individu als who will place their own ph ysical comfort ahead of their assigned duti es. Remind them that their mission as Marines is to fi ght, and to do s o suc cessfully requires that weapons and e quipment be maintained in wo rking order. c. Personal Cont act and Com munica tions . It is essential that each ind ividual and group be kept info rmed of what i s happening. Due to th e deadening of the senses typically encountered in col d weather, a man left alone may quickly become oblivious to his surroundings, los e his sense of direction, his con cern for his unit, and in e xtreme cases, for himself. He may become l ike a sheep and mer ely follows al ong, not knowin g or caring whether his un it is advancing or withdrawing. Each commander must take strong measu res to ensure that small unit le aders keep their subordinates informed. This is particularly true of th e company commanders keeping their platoon commanders info rmed, of platoon c ommande rs informing their squad leaders, and th e squad leaders info rming t heir men. General information is o f value, but th e greatest import ance must be placed on matte rs of im mediate c oncern and inte rest to th e indivi dual. The chain of command must be rigidly followed and leaders must see that no ma n is left uninfo rmed as to his immediate sur roundin g and s ituation. (1) If your Marines find it h ard to r emember thin gs they have been taught, show patience and re view or ders, drills and SOP’s. Keep their minds busy. (2) Tempe rs normally flare up du ring this type of training, so expe ct and be prepared to d eal with it whe n it comes. Maintain your sense of humor, lead by example, and don ’t let unanticipated pr oblems get the bes t of you. d. Time/Distan ce Factors . Mount ain op erations do ctrine recommends that tactical commanders b e given every oppo rtunit y to exploit local situ ations an d take the initiative when the oppo rtunity is presented. B ecause of the increased amount of time involv ed in a moveme nt and the additional time required to a ccomplish even simple tasks, deviation from tactical pl ans is difficult. Tactical plans are developed after a thorough reconnaissance and det ailed estimate of the situation. Suff icient flexibilit y is allowed each subor dinate leader to use his initi ative and in genuity in accompli shing his m ission. Time lags are compensat ed fo r by time ly issuance of warning orders, by anticipating charges in the tactical situation, an d the early issuan ce of frag orders. Recognition of time/distan ce factors is the k ey to suc cessful t actical operations in col d weather mountainous regions. (1) Time-Distance Formula (TDF) . Thi s formula is designed to b e a guideline and s hould not be consid ered as the exa ct amount of time required for your move ment. Furthermore, this fo rmula is for u se in id eal conditions.

Two e nvironm ents must be overcome in mountainous regions; one created by the enemy and the second cr eated by the climate an d terrain. The climatic environment must not b e permitted to s ap the energy of th e unit to a point wh ere it can no lon ger cope with the enemy. The leader must be in sup erior physical cond ition. H e cannot expe nd the addition al energy required by his concern for his men and s till have the necessary energy to lead and d irect his unit in combat.

Survival ASP ECTS OF LEAD ERSHIP . When dealing with leadership ch allenges in a survival situation, the f oremost weapon a leader must emplo y is his vigilance : a leader’s attention should be focused on e nsuring all Marines of the unit a re contributing to the overall success of the s ituation. a. Cohesion . As a leader, you must ensure that all mem bers of th e team are working towards the survivabilit y of the unit. Y ou can not al low individu als or small gr oups to formulat e their own goals or pl an of action. b. Self-Worth . A M arine without se lf-worth is a Marine who does not v alue living. Leadership is a critical; factor in build ing self-worth. Ta sks must be found fo r each Marine in whi ch best suits th eir situation whil e attempting to re ceive positi ve results. (i.e., A m an with a brok en leg can monitor the fire, A man with a broken arm ca n still procure water for the unit ). This will make ea ch and every Marine feel useful a nd not a burden to the other members, regardless of their individu al situation. c. Natural Reactions to Stress . Leadership must quickly identify natural reactions to signs of stress his M arines may be displ aying (i.e., Fear, Anxiet y, Guilt, De pression). Failure to recognize th ese signs early will result in injuries, illness, or death which will re duce the unit’ s comba t effectiveness. Corrective action mus t be taken immediatel y 4 d. Will to Survive . The will to su rvive is a “mind -set” that mus t be instilled an d reinforced within al l Marines. W ithout the “will to su rvive”, Marines will not succeed. Th e foll owing tools c an aid to d evelop th is “mind- set”. WSVX.01.02 05- 4"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"(1) The Code of Conduct. (2) Pled ge of All egiance. (3) Faith in Ame rica.

(WSVX.02.07b) As reflected in th e diagram above, the earth continuous ly move s in a cycle from solstice to equinox; throughout each day, however, the sun appears to travels in a unifo rm arc across th e sky from sunrise to suns et. Exactl y half-way along its daily journey, the s un will be directly south of an obs erver (or north if the observer is in the Southern Hemisphere). This r ule may not appl y to obs ervers in the tropics (between 23.5 d egrees north and south latitude) or in th e polar regions (60 d egrees latitude). It is at this point that shadows will appear their shor test. The time at which thi s occurs is referred to as “local apparent noon. ” c. Sun’s Bearing .

(WSVX.02.07d ) The only material required is a small piece of cardboard or other flat-surface mat erial, a watch, a pen or p encil, a nd a 1 to 2 inch pin or nail. a. Set thi s tiny rod up right on your flat piece of mater ial so that the sun will c ause it to c ast a shadow. Ma rk the position wh ere the base of t he rod sits so it can be returned to the same spot for later readings. Place the navigator flat on lev el ground. Se cure the navigator from wind by placing rocks on it. Write the date and mark th e tip of t he shadow. b. As the sun m oves th e shadow-tip moves . Make repeated shadow- tip mark ings every 15 m inutes . As you make the marks on the tip of th e sha dow e nsure that you write down th e time. c. At th e end of the day, connect the s hadow- tip mark ings. The result will nor mally be a curved line. The arch will be less pronoun ced clos er to th e vernal or autumnal equinoxes (March 20 a nd September 23).

Animals will avoid a set whi ch smells threatening or unusual to them (i.e., human s cent or P.O. L.’s from equipment or clothing). (a) Man leaves a scent through the pores of the skin b y the sweat glands. Use an odo rless contact glove when build ing a set. It may take up to three days for your scent to diss ipate if made without g loves. (b) Certain boot sol es and clot hing may leave a scent, generally this can be detected by the human nose .

Ideally, you should e at the heart and liv er first to avoid spoili ng. There are two methods of cooki ng. 1) Boiling . This is the best method for c ooking. Boiling enables the su rvivor to consume the animal fat and nutr ients, which coll ect in th e broth. 2) Roasting . This method is was teful and will not be ut ilized in a su rvival situation. 4. TANNING HIDES (WSVX.02.09b) A. Fleshin g . Fleshing is the actual removal of meat, tissu e, and fat from the hide. Fleshing is easier when don e as soon a s possibl e, preferably before the hide starts to d ry. 1) Soak o r wet the hide if dry. 2) Lay the hide on a solid, smooth, round obj ect (i.e., log or canteen). 3) Holdin g a bayonet, blunt kni fe, sharp ston e or bone tool sc rapper at a 10 degree angle away from the bod y, push the fat and me mbrane off th e leather.

Grasp the skin at different points all around i ts perimete r and pu ll, pull, pul l. 3) If rope is not a vailable, rub t he skin b y sittin g on th e ground a nd hook ing the skin over your feet and pull ing. G. Smoking . Smoking t he hid e will help make the hide water repellant. 1) Add we t or green wood c hips to th e fire. Sage or willow are good w oods. Th e object is to get the chips to smoke, not bu rn. 2) It only takes a few m inutes to smoke, but b e careful to prevent flame from ruinin g the hide. H. Anima l Hid e Uses .

One of the simplest weapons for survival is the throwin g stick. As a tool, th e throwin g stick can be used to kno ck dead branches out of a tree that would no rmall y be too h igh to r each. The dead branches can then be used as firewood. (1) Find a stick straight as possibl e, 2.5 -3 feet long, and 1.5 -2 inches in diameter. (2) Remove the bark from the stick. (3) Taper each end of th e stick. (4) Fire harden the entire stick if using green wood. (5) There are two methods of em ploying the throwing stick. When in forested area, the bes t method is to use an overhand throwing motion. In an open area, you can increase the killin g radius by using a sidearm throwing motion. 4. EXPEDIENT PACKS .

There is little diffe rence in snow sho eing compar ed to no rmal walking, except that the surface being walked on i s inconsist ent, and snow shoes are longer, wider, heavier, and c onsequently more awkward, th an no rmal footwear. With standard militar y snowshoe s, the stride is somewhat lon ger than in no rmal walking, but th e shape of th e snowshoe allows the snow s hoer’s stance to be a normal widt h, thereby reducing much st rain and fatigue on his hips an d legs. Its should b e stressed that the snowsho er should w alk in a relaxed, a nd no rmal rolling toe manne r, and should onl y lift the snowshoe high enough to c lear the surface of the snow. b. Turning . (1) The kick turn . This is no rmall y the easiest w ay to ch ange directions on l evel ground. O ne snowsho e is swung up t o the front so th at its tail is on th e snow, 12- 6 WSVX .02.12"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"then it i s allowed to pivot towa rds the new direction. T he other snowsho e is then br ought around. (a) On ste ep terrain . It is important to re member t o step off with the uph ill foot, wh en ch anging direction. Fo r example: if making a turn to the right, shift y our weight to th e left foot, fa ce down th e slope , and swin g the right snow sho e around to point in th e direction of the next switchback. Then s tamp the right snowshoe into th e snow. M ake sure the tail is not on the left snowsho e. Now, g ently shift y our weight to your right foot and sw ing the left snowsho e around so it i s parallel with y our right snowsho e. (b) Each succeeding man . When using the kick turn technique on st eep terrain, try and stay well above your previous trail. This tr ail has undermined the snow on whi ch you are now building the turn. As e ach succeeding man uses the turn, i t will t end to slou gh off on the shoulders, and the men tow ard the end of the column will have a hard time getting around. Thi s can be prevented if care is used by each man in placing his snowsho es precisely where those in f ront of him have placed theirs. If there is onl y one way around a n obs tacle, this ca n be very important. (2) The star turn . This can also be used to change direction b y simpl y executing a series of ha lf facing movem ents. (3) Choosing a route . When climbing, p lan to use the gentlest places on a s lope for turns. Look ahead, and pic k the route, using the terrain to y our advantage. Avoid th e steep terrain and don’ t hesitate to ma ke short swit chbacks. c. Side St ep . This is use d when the slope is at a critical angle. d. Herringbone . This is use d when the slop e is at a gradual angle. e. Cross ing Obstacles . Here are a few simple rules to re member. (1) Alwa ys step over obstacles . Do this to a void d amaging snowsho es and losing balance. (2) Never bridge a gap . Bridging a gap is when the sno wshoe t ip and tail are supporting your weight, whil e the center of th e shoe is suspended. (3) Shallow snow . In shallow s now, the re is a danger of ca tching, and t earing the webbing on tr ee stumps , or snag, which are only slightly covered. (4) Wet snow .

Basic Ter minol ogy . Prior to discussing tracking, some basic terms must be understood: a. Trails and Runs . In any area, there will b e man y thoroughfares or trails and runs. Some may be seasonal, w hile others ma y be used by many different species. Runs are infrequently or inte rmittently used thorou ghfares that connect trails to specific feeding, beddin g, or watering areas. If trails are like highways connecting cities and towns , runs a re like streets providin g access to the gas stations, sup ermarkets, and neighborhood s.   13- 1 WSVX.02.13"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"b. Beds and Lays . Beds are frequent ly used sleeping areas commonly referred to a s dens or burrows. Th ese can be found in hollow logs, trees, rock pil es, brush pil es, grass, thickets, or e ven out in th e open. A lay is an infrequently used resting or sleeping spot. It is rarely used more th an onc e. c. Rubs . Some rubs a re accidental and some are deliberate. Accidental rubs c an be in a burrow, on a trail, or ove r/und er a fallen tree across a trail. Deliberate rubs can be when an animal scratches a hard-to-reach spot, or when a deer scrapes its a ntlers against a tree to remove its ve lvet. d. Scratches . They also ca n be accidental or deliberate. Accidental scratches are left by animals climbing trees or on a log where it left a belly rub. D eliberate scratches can be found at t he base of tr ees where they have reached up a nd raked their claws downwa rd for any number of re asons. Sc ratches can also be found in th e ground where cats have buried scat, squirrels have cached nut s, or animals are digging at a scent. e. Transference . Transference is the removal of material from one area onto anot her. Transference can occur when walking along a mudd y stream bank and c rossing a log. The mud left on t he log is co nsidered transference. f. Compression . Compression is th e actual flattening of the soil o r snow p ack. It is caused by the pressing down or leveling of soil, s and, stones, twigs, or leaves by the weight of the body. Com pression is more lik ely to be found in fr ozen, h ard, dry, sandy condi tions w here there is no mois ture to hold a clear and lasting imprint. g. Disturbance . Disturbance is the eye-catching effect of unnatu ral patterns. This is v ery common in a snow c overed environment, examples are: (1) Shovelin g snow- w hile the initial tossed snow is tr ansference, once it melts it will disturb the top l ayer of the snow p ack, leaving an unn atural pattern. (2) Forward move ment- al l forward moveme nt, man or animal, will kick snow forward. Th e initia l tossed snow is t ransference, but b ecomes distu rbance once the snow h as me lted. h. Gait . (WSVX.02.13a) A gait is generally the way an animal moves. Gaits are very critical in th e identification of a nimal tracks. Although certain gaits are more indicative of certain animals, they may (depending on th e circumstanc es) modif y or alter their gait to another style.   13- 2 WSVX.02.13"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"(1) Diagonal Walker .

Spoor . The actual track or trail of an animal, which can be identified a s to s ize, shape, type and pattern. This wo rd is ge nerally interchanged with t rack. Spoor is broken dow n into two segmen ts: aerial and g round. 2. Reading Spoor . Unless a clearly visible ground s poor is readable, interpretations must be made in order to determine “what a nimal made this?” Prior to ev er attempting to r ead spoo r, one must be thoroughly knowl edgeable about wh at animals a re in the area. a. The first step is to look a t the gait. This will ge nerally narrow down th e species. b. The next step is determined which a nimal family the track belongs to. (WSVX.02.13b) (1) Cat Family .

After the famil y is know n, using various clues will help identify the species. (WSVX.02.13c) (1) If the tracker is educated on th e behavior a nd habits of ani mals, he can determine the individua l species. This infor mation can be used fo r better employment of traps and snares. The following is an example. (a) Walking along a creek bank, y ou notice a set of tracks that have five toe prints for both front a nd back feet with visible claw prints. This information tells y ou the prints belon g to the weasel family. The tracks have a bound ing gait pattern, whi ch eliminat es wide-bodi ed animals such as badger, skunk, porcupine, and wolv erine. Because the tracks are approxima tely the size of a dime, you have eliminated mart en and fisher. The tracks are followin g the stream bank fo r some distance, stoppin g at small holes along the bank’s edge. Knowin g that weasels like grassy meadows, you can determine that the track is p robably made by a mink. 3. Age Determination . (WSVX.02.13d) It is very critical to b e able to d etermine track age. Each area and climate w ill vary in th e effects of ag ing tracks, so pr actice, experimentation, and expe rience is vital in that area. The following factors deteriorate all tracks and must be factored. a. Weathe r - Last snow or rain, fo g, and dew. b. Sun. c. Wind. d.

Therefore, relatively wet s cat on the outsid e could b e old. Th e only way to determine the age is by analyzing the insid e. When assessing scat, care must be taken to a void th e poss ibility of cont racting disease. 4. Size Estimation . (WSVX.02.13e ) Althou gh there is no exa ct method to d etermine a ctual unit size, an approximation can be made. a. Up to a S quad . It is possible to c ount basket mark s, if on skis. The track is generally clean and s traight. It is possible to id entify mult iple ski and/or snow s hoe tracks. b. Squad to Pl atoon S ize . If on skis, bas ket marks are difficult to distinguish from each other and ma y look lik e a small ditch. Th e track is somewhat c lean and straight, but maybe a half-a-width wid er than no rmal ( i.e., 3 ski tracks or 3 snow shoes tracks wide). c. Platoon t o Compan y Size . The track is slopp y and wide, possibly 2-3 times wider than nor mal. The edges of the track are destroyed at bends a nd cu rves. 5. Tracking . a. The best time to track is e arly in the mornin g or late in the a fternoon du e to th e height of the sun to cast shadows.

The more distance you gain, the more time to enable you to create devices to dis courage a tracker. (1) Create simple pathguards along your trail . An expe rienced tracker will not pick up thin gs along the trail because of th e possibilit y of being “booby trapped”. If he notices possible traps, he will use more caution a nd slow his pace.

REQ UIREMEN TS TO MAINTAIN HEA LTH . Maintenance of health is th e first step in preventing injuries. Th e three requirements are: (WSVX.02.14a ) A. WATER (1) A person can not survive without water for more than a few days. Your body loses water through normal body processes (sweating, urinating, and breathing). During norm al activity the kidneys excrete 1 to 2 qu arts of water per day and a person e vaporates . 5 to qua rt per day. Other factors, such a s heat exposure, cold expos ure, intense activity, high altitude, burns, o r illness, can cause y our body to lose more w ater. Water intake is critical in preventing illness. 14- 1 WSVX.02.14"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":" B. FOOD (1) The bod y can live several weeks without food. How ever, without an adequate suppl y to stay healthy your mental a nd ph ysical capabilities will d eteriorate rapidly. Food s upplies the bod y with the necessary nutrients and e nergy to survive. (2) Food sou rces are plants, animals, and fis h. (a) Fiber . Fiber prevents ir ritable bowel syndrome. In the Falklands campaign the B ritish ha d a major constipation a nd di arrhea probl em. This was largely caused by dehydration and a low fib er diet. Grasses and pi ne needles are a good s ource of dietary fiber. (b) Vitamins . Vitamins are essential to metaboli c fun ctioni ng of the bod y and c old we ather compounds this fun ction. Our bodies cannot make vitamins so we must provid e them in ou r diet. Most edibl e plant lif e contains many different vit amins . Asso ciated illn esses from long term deficiency are Scurvy (vitamin C) a physical disease and Beriberi (vitamin B1) a mental disease. Vitamins can be found in the c ambium layer of trees, pine needles, and stinging nettle. (c) Minerals . The miner al tha t we are primaril y concerned with is I ron. Iron deficiency causes a 9% decrease in he at energy production. Iron acts as a thermo regulator. Consum ing only 1/3 RD A of iron re sults in a 29% greater heat los s during cold exposur e. Animal blood, dandelions, st inging nettle, and mar row p rovide the major source of iron. Ensur e these foods ar e prop erly prepared. (d) Calories . To p roduc e energy, the bod y uses calories. Prot eins, fats, or carbohydrates produ ce calories. Of th ese three, certain one s produce better energy than others do. Anima l meat is an exce llent sou rce for caloric intake, although nu ts from pinecones can suppl ement it. 1. Protein . Proteins are a reparative food of complic ated molec ules compos ed of chains of amino acids. The re are nume rous kinds of amino acids which cannot be synthesized by the bod y and thus must be consumed in the diet. A pure protein diet can cause fatalities in 3 -8 weeks from Rabbi t St arv a t ion , a term used for living on a r elatively fat free rabbit diet. P rotein can be found in d andelions, nut s, and m eats. 14- 2 WSVX.02.14"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"2. Fat . Fats serve as the main storage form of energy. Fats produce energy and heat. Fats are best obt ained from bone marrow, liv er, or the stomach po rtion of f ish 3. Carbohydrates . Carbohydrates are know n as the qui ck energy food. They produce lots of heat. The y are stored in the liver and muscles. These organs are not large and c an be mark edly depleted by fasting for as short as 24 hour s. Catt ails, nuts are a source for carbohydrates. C. PERSONAL HYGIENE (1) Cleanliness is a n important factor in pr eventing infection an d disease. It becomes even more important in a s urvival situ ation. (2) The areas to pay special attention to a re the feet, hand s, armpits, crotch, an d hair. Visual and ph ysical inspe ctions s hould be conducted daily. Hand a nd finger nails should be kept as clean as possible to prevent infection of mucous m embrane. (a) Soap ( lye) can be mad e from animal fat and ashes. (b) Sun bath (3) Teeth are another important area to keep clean. Br ush your teeth e ach day either with a toothb rush, or if you don't have one, make a chewing stick. (a) A chewing stick is ma de out of a twig about 6 to 8 in ches long. Chew on e end of the stick to separate the fibers. Now you can brush y our teeth. 2. FIVE WAYS THE BODY LOSE S HEAT A. Radiation: is direct heat loss from the body to its surround ings. If the surroundin gs are colder than the body, the net result is heat loss. A nud e man loses about 60% of his tot al bod y heat by radiation. Spe cifically, heat is lost in th e form of infrared radiation. I nfrared targeting devices work by detecting radiant heat loss. B. Conduc tion: is the direct transfer of heat from one object in contact with a c older object. (1) Most commonly conduction o ccurs wh en an indivi dual sits or rests directly upon a c old obj ect, su ch as snow, the ground, or a rock. W ithout an insulating layer between the Marine and th e object (such as an isopo r mat) , one quickly begins to lose h eat. This i s why it's important to not sit or s leep directly on cold ground or snow without a mat or a pack acting as insul ation. C. Convection : is heat loss to the atmosphere or a liquid. Air and wa ter can both be thou ght of a s \"liquids \" runnin g over the surface of the body. Wate r or air, which is in c ontact with the body, attempts to abs orb heat from the bod y until the bod y and air or w ater is both th e sam e temper atures. However, 14- 3 WSVX.02.14"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"if the air or water is continuousl y moving ov er the bod y, the temper atures can never equalize and the body keeps losing heat. D. Evaporation . Heat loss from evaporation oc curs when water (sweat) on th e surface of th e skin is turned into wa ter vapor. This p rocess requires energy in th e form of heat and th is heat comes from the bod y. (1) This is the major method the bod y uses to cool itself down. T his is why you sweat when you work hard or PT. One quart of swe at, which you can easily produce in an hour of hard PT , will take abou t 600 c alories of he at away from the bod y when it e vaporates. E. Respiration. When you inhale, the air you breathe in is w armed by the bod y and saturated with w ater vapor. The n when you exhale, that heat is los t. That is w hy breath c an be seen in c old air. Respiration is really a combination of convection (heat being transferred to moving a ir by the lungs) and evaporation, with both processes oc curring insid e the body. 3. PHYSICAL RESPO NSES TO HEA T . When the body begins to cr eate excess heat, it responds in s everal wa ys to rid itself of that heat. A. Initially, the blood ve ssels in th e skin expand, or di late. This dilation al lows more blood to t he surface where the heat can mor e easily be transferred to the surroundings. B. Soon afterwards, swe ating begins. This c ontributes to h eat loss through convection and e vaporation. 4. PHYSICAL RESPO NSES TO COL D . Almos t the oppos ite occurs as wi th heat. A. First, blood v essels at the skin s urface close dow n, or constrict. This does two things: (1) Less blood g oes near the surface of the body so tha t less heat is lost to th e outsid e. (2) More blood goes to the \"core\" or the center of th e bod y, to keep the brain, heart,lungs, liver, and kidne ys warm. This me ans fin gers and to es tend to g et cold. B. If that is not enough to k eep the body warm, the next step is shiv ering. Shiver ing is reflexive regular muscular c ontractions, this m uscul ar activity causes heat production. A s mention ed before, shivering can onl y last for a short time b efore exhaustion occurs. With shivering you will either warm up, a s usu ally occurs, or 14- 4 WSVX.02.14"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"continue to get colder and start to be come h ypothermic. Hypothermia will be discussed later. 5. ENVIR ONMENTAL INJURI ES (WSVX.02.14b) are cold w eather inju ries, dehydration, a nd altitude related illnesses. A. COL D WEATHER INJURIES : 1) Hypother mia (MSVX.02.14 c) is the state when the bod y’s core temperature falls to 95 d egrees Fahrenheit or less. It is the numb er one killer of people in a survival s ituation . A comm on belief that extr emely cold temperatures are needed for hypothermia to occur is not true. Most ca ses occur whe n the temperature is between 30 and 50 d egrees Fahrenheit. This is th e normal temperature range at MWTC, exce pt duri ng the harshest of wint er. a) Causes of Hypothermia. The ways in which t he body generates and los es heat has been disc ussed earlier. Quite simpl y, hypothermia occurs when heat loss f rom the bod y exceeds the body's ability to produce heat. Contributing factors include:  Ambient temperature. Outsid e air temper ature.  Wind chill. This only affects improperly clothed individu als.  Wet clothing.  Cold water immersion.  Improper clothin g.  Exhaustion.  Alcohol intoxi cation, ni cotine and dr ugs such as b arbiturates and tranquilizers.  Injuries. Those causing immobilit y or major bleeding, major bu rn and head trauma. b) Signs an d symptoms of H ypothermia  The numbe r one sign to look fo r is altered mental status; that is, th e brain is literally getting cold. Th ese signs might includ e confusion, slurred speech, strange behavior, i rritability, impaired jud gment, hallucinations, or f atigue.  As hypothermia w orsens, vi ctims will los e consciousne ss and eventually slip into a coma. 14- 5 WSVX.02.14"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":" Shive ring. Reme mber that shiv ering is a major w ay the body tries to warm itself early on, a s it fi rst begins to get cold. Shiv ering stops for 2 reasons:  The bod y has warmed back up t o a normal tempe rature range.  The bod y has con tinued to cool. Below 95  F shivering begins to decrease and by 90  F it ceases completely.  Obvious ly, continu ed coolin g is bad. So if a M arine with whom you are working, who was shivering, stops shivering, you must determine if that is because he has warmed up or c ontinued to c ool.  A victim with s evere hypothermia may actually appear to be quite dead, without breathing or a pulse. Howe ver, people who have been found thi s way have b een suc cessfull y \"brought back to lif e\" with no permanent damage. So remembe r, you are n ot de ad until y ou ar e w arm an d de ad . c) Prevention of H ypothermia  Obvious ly, prevention is a lways better (and muc h easier) than treatment.  Cold weather clothin g must be properly warm and ca red for.  Keep your clothin g as dry as possibl e.  If your feet are cold, wear a hat. Up to 80 % of th e bod y's heat can escape from the head.  Avoid d ehydration. D rink 6 - 8 quarts per day.  Eat adequately.  Avoid f atigue and exha ustion.  Increase levels of ac tivity as the temper ature drops. Do not rem ain stationary when the tempe rature is ve ry low. I f the tactical situa tion does not permit moving ab out, perform isometri c exe rcises of successive muscles.  Use the buddy system to check each other for signs/symptoms of hypothermia. d) Treatment of Hypothermia . 14- 6 WSVX.02.14"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":" Make the diagnosis.  Prevent fu rther heat loss.  Remove the victim from the environment (i.e., into a shelter or snow cave).  Insulate the victim.  Rewarm the victim by: *Zip two sl eeping bags together. *Pre-warm the bag by a stripped Marine. *Place the victim in the bag with 2 s tripped Ma rines inside on both sid es of the victim.  Medevac if possibl e. e) Other Points to R emember .  Fluids. If the victim is mildly hypothermic, he may be given hot we ts. Otherwise give him nothin g by mouth.  Avoid, if poss ible, excessive movement of the victim, as his h eart may stop be ating if it is jarred.  Major Wounds. Appl y first aid to ma jor wounds fir st, before attempting to re -warm the victim. Re-warming a victim who ha s bled to death do es little good.  Never give alcohol to h ypothermia victims.  Even after you have started re-warming a victim, he must be cons tantly monitor ed. Don 't forget about him. 2) FROSTBITE Frostbite is the actual freezing of tissues. Whe n in a survival situation, re warming a severe frostbitten area will not help. It is best to w ait fo r rescue and medical a ttention. a) Prevention of F rostbite . Frostbite is a n entirely preventable injury.  Dress in la yers. Keep comfort ably cool. If you begin to become uncomfor table, add layers.  Keep clothes dry. If clothing (especially socks and g loves) become wet, c hange them. This may mean you have to change sock 4-5 times a day.  Dress pr operly. If the wind is b lowing, wear the correct protective layer.  Avoid d ehydration. When dehydrated, the amount of blood a vailable to warm your fingers and to es goes down, in creasing the risk of f rostbite.  Avoid Sta rvation. R emember - Food i s Fuel - and the bod y uses that fuel to make heat.  Leadership must ensure that pr eventive measures are taken. 14- 7 WSVX.02.14"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"b) Signs an d Symptoms of Frostbit e .  Ears, nose, fin gers and to es are affected first.  Areas will feel cold a nd may tingle leading to....  Numbness whic h progresses to...  Waxy appearance wi th skin stiff and un able to glide freely over a joint. c) Treatment of Frostbit e . Frostbite is cl assified into th ree different degrees: Frosting, Super ficial Frostbite, and D eep Frostbite.  Frosting will r evert to no rmal after usin g the techniqu e of body heat rewarming.  Hold th e affected area, skin to skin for 15 minutes . *Rewarm face, nose, and ea rs with h ands. *Rewarm hands in armpit s, groin or belly. *Rewarm feet with mountain budd y’s armpits or belly.  If affected area cannot b e rewarmed in 15 minutes, Superficial Frostbite or Deep Frostbite is susp ected. Do not a ttempt to further rewar m Splint the affected area. Protect the affected area from further injur y. Medevac as soon as possible. DO NOT RUB ANY COLD INJURY WI TH SNOW. Do not ma ssage the a ffected area. Do not r ewarm with stove or fire: a burn i njury may result. Loosen constricting clothing. Avoid tob acco products. d) Treatment of Supe rficial or Deep frostbit e . Any frostbite injury, regardless of severity, is treated the same – evacuate the casualty and re -warming in th e rear. Unless the tactical situation prohi bits evacuation or you are in a survi val situation, no cons i de r at ion s houl d be gi v en to re -w ar ming fr os t bit e in t he fi eld. The reason is somethin g-called freeze – th aw – r e-freeze injury.  Freeze – Th aw – Re -freeze injury occurs whe n a frostbitten extr emity is thawed out, then be fore it can heal (which takes weeks and ma ybe months ) it freezes again. This has devastating effects and greatly worsens the initial inju ry.  In an extreme emergency it is be tter to walk out on a f rostbitt en foot than to wa rm it up a nd th en have it freeze again.  Treat frozen extr emities as fractures - c arefully pad and splint. 14- 8 WSVX.02.14"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":" Treat frozen f eet as litter cases.  Prevent fu rther freezing injury.  Do not fo rget about hypothermia. Ke ep the victim warm and dry.  Once in th e rear, a frostbitt en extremity is re-warmed in a water bath, with th e temperature strictly maintain ed at 101  F - 108  F. 3) SNOW BLINDN ESS a. Definition. Sunburn of th e cornea. b. Causes of Snow Blindness. There are two reasons M arines in a wint er mountainous environment ar e at increased risk for snow b lindness.  High altitude. L ess ultraviolet (UTV ) rays are filtered out , UV r ays are what c ause snow blindne ss (as well as sunbu rn). So at altitude, more UV rays are available to c ause dama ge.  Snow. The whit e color of snow reflects much more LTV rays off of the ground a nd back into y our face. c. Signs an d Symptoms of Snow Blindne ss .  Painful eyes.  Hot, s ticky, or gritty sensation in the eyes, like sand in the eyes.  Blurred vision.  Headache may be severe.  Exces sive tearing.  Eye muscle spasm.  Bloods hot eyes. d. Prevention of Snow Blindn ess . Prevention is v ery simple. Always wear sunglasses, with UV protection. If sunglasses are not available, then f ield expedient sunglasses can be made from a strip of cardboard with ho rizontal slits, an d charcoal can be appl ied und er the eyes to cut down on r eflection of the sun off th e snow. e. Treatment of Snow Blindness .  Evacuation, when possibl e. 14- 9 WSVX.02.14"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":" Patch the eyes to prevent any more light reaching them.  Wet compr esses, if it is not too cold, ma y help re lieve some of th e discomfort.  Healing normall y takes two da ys for mild cases or up to a week for more se vere cases. 4) TRENCHFOOT / IM MERSION FOOT a) Definition . This is a cold - wet injury to th e feet or hands f rom prolonged (generally 7 - 10 hou rs) expos ure to water at temperatures abov e freezing. b) Causes of Trench foot/ Immersion Foot . The major r isk factors are wet, cold and immobilit y. c) Signs an d Symptoms of Tr ench foot /Immersion F oot.  The major symptom will be pain. T rench foot is an ext remely painful injury.  Trench foot a nd frostbit e are often very difficult to t ell apart just fr om lookin g at it. Oft en they may both be present at the sam e time. Signs include:  Red and pu rple mottled skin.  Patches of white skin.  Very wrinkle d skin.  Severe cases may leave gangrene and bliste rs.  Swellin g.  Lowered or even absent pulse.  Trench foot is c lassified from mild to sev ere. d) Prevention of T rench foot /Immersion F oot is aimed simpl y at preventing cold, wet a nd immobile feet (or hands).  Keep feet warm and dry. 14- 10 WSVX.02.14"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":" Change socks a t least on ce a day. Let your feet dry briefly during the change, and wip e out the inside of th e boot. S ock changes may be required more oft en.  Exerc ise.

It cannot be treated effectively in the field.  While awaiting evacuation: The feet should b e dried, wa rmed, a nd elevated. The pain is often severe, even thou gh the injur y may appear mild; it may require medic ation such as morphine.  In the rear, the healing of trench foot usu ally takes at least two months, and ma y take almost a year. Seve re cases ma y require amputation. Tre n c h foot i s not t o be ta k en lightl y. B. DEH YDRATION 1. Dehyd ration is a deficit of total body water. Dehydration will compound the problems faced in a s urvival situation. De hydration is the second leading cause of all dea ths in a survival s ituation . a) Symptoms . Whe n dehydrated, the followin g signs an d symptoms will a ppear:  Headache and nausea.  Dizziness and f ainting.  Cramps, both abdominal and extr emity.  Weakness and l ethargy.  Dark urine wi th a very strong odo r. b) Prevention . Prevention is the key to prevent dehydration. Th e followin g are basic guidelines for the prevention of d ehydration:  Alwa ys drink wa ter when eating. Water is used an d consumed as a part of the digestion p rocess. I f you have plenty of food but no wa ter – Do not e at until a source of w ater can be found.  Conserve energy. Pace yourself. 14- 11 WSVX.02.14"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":" Drink 6 -8 qu arts of w ater per day when available. In other words, continually drink th rough out th e day. Don’t wait until you are dehydrated.  Monitor the color of your urine.  Don't rely on thirst as an ind icator. 2. H eat related illness es . The fo llowin g illnesses will a ppear from dehydration: 1. Heat syncope . Heat syncope is feinting due to vaso-dilation from the heat. 2. Heat exhaustion . Heat exhaustion occurs when bod y salt losses and dehydration from sweating are so severe that a person c an no l onger maintain ad equate blood pr essure. Heat exhaustion c an lead to h eat stroke. a) Symptoms include; headaches, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, and fainting. 3. Heat stroke . Heat stroke is a failure of th e bod y's coolin g mechanisms that rid the bod y of exc essive heat build up. a) Signs an d symptoms Symptoms are the same as heat exhaustion . Th e signs include delirious o r coma, pinpoint pupils, flush ed skin, sweating may or may not be present. b) Heat cramps . Heat cramps are painful sp asms of ske letal muscle as a result of body salt. c) All of t hese illnesses can be detrimental to y our survival. Dress properly, rest and adequate w ater intak e can help prevent th ese illnesses. C. ALTI TUD E RELATED ILLNESSES: 1. Acute Mountain Si ckness . Acute Mountain Si ckness (AMS) is a self-limiti ng illness due to th e rapid exposure of an unacclimatized indivi dual to hi gh altitude (i.e., helicopter crash on a mountain) . Approxim ately 25% of individu als who ascend rapidly to 8,000 – 9,000 f eet will develop AMS. Virtually, all un- acclimatized persons w ho rapidly ascend to 11,00 – 12,000 fe et will develop AMS.

Rest and a cclimatize your body. A. CARBON MONOXIDE POISONI NG 1. Definition. Carbon Monoxide (CO) is a heavy, odorless, colorless, tasteless gas resulting from incomplete c ombustion of fossil fuels. CO kills th rough asphyxia even in the presence of adequate oxygen, because oxygen-transporting hemoglobi n has a 210 times greater affinity for CO th an fo r oxygen. What this means is that CO replaces and takes the place of the oxygen in the body causing Carbon Monoxi de poisonin g. 2. Signs/S ymptoms. The signs and symptoms depend on t he amount of CO the victim has inhaled. In mild cases, the victim may have only dizziness, headache, and confusion; se vere cases can cause a deep coma . Sudden respiratory arrest may occur. The classic sign of C O poisoning is ch erry-red lip colo r, but this i s usually a very late and s evere sign, actually the skin is no rmall y found to be pale or blue. CO poisonin g should b e suspected whenever a person in a poor ly ventilated area suddenly collapses. Recognizing this c ondition ma y be difficult whe n all members of the party are affected. 3. Treatment . The first step is to immediately remov e the victim from the contaminated area. a) Victims with mild CO po isoning who have not lost cons cious ness need fresh a ir and light duty for a minimum of fou r hour s. If oxygen is av ailable administe r it. More severely affected victims may require rescue breathing. b) Fortunately, the lungs excrete CO within a few hour s. 14- 13 WSVX.02.14"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"c) Prevention . Ensu re there is adequate ventilation wh en uti lizing a fire near your shelter. 6. MEDIC AL AID . Unfo rtunately, during a survival situ ation, a corpsman may not a lways be available to r ender assistance. Therefore, the survivo r mus t be knowle dgeable in b asic first aid as taught in the M arine Battle Skil ls Training Handbook. A Four Life S aving Steps 1) Start the breathing. 2) Stop the bleeding. 3) Treat the wound. 4) Check fo r shock. B. Wound s . Wounds are actual breaks in th e integrity of th e skin. W ounds can be caused by accident or by animals. Thes e wounds ar e most serious in a surviv al situ ation, not onl y because of t issue damage and blood loss, but also because of infe ction. B y taking proper care of the wound y ou can reduce the chance of a debilitating infection. C. Animals . Prevention of an a nimal bite is best accompli shed through knowl edge of behavior, p ersonalities, and patterns. 1) Anima ls generally give ample w arning of th eir inte ntions, which are to re pel the intruder or permit its es cape. Animals that act out of c haracter and a pproach huma ns should b e considered rabid and avoided. 2) Tearing, cutting, and cr ushin g injuries are combined in a nimal bites. Alwa ys look fo r secondary injuries. B. D. First Aid. Whethe r the wound was caused b y accident or by animal, the treatment re mains th e same. 1) Early cleansing of the w ound re duces the chance of bacterial infection and is extremely effective in re movin g rabies and oth er viruses. Cleanse by irrigation. B leeding wounds a lso help s the irrigation pro cess initially. 2) Open wound manag ement is best described by the \"open treatment\" method. Do not t ry to suture or close the wound. This will se al any dirt or i nfection into t he wound. As lon g as the wound ca n drain it will usu ally not become life threatening. a) Maggots b) Super glue 14- 14 WSVX.02.14"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"c) Shunt 3) Tourniquet in a su rvival situation . If no rescue or medical a id is likely for over 2 hours, a n attempt to SLOWL Y loosen the tour niquet ma y be made 20 minutes after it is applied: a) Ensure pressure dressing is in pla ce. b) Ensure bleeding has stopped. c) Loosen tourniquet SLOWLY to restore circulation. d) Leave loose ned tou rniqu et in pos ition in c ase bleeding resumes . e) Bandaging is meant to protect the wound f rom foreign objects (i.e., dirt). f) As wit h any injur y to the body you must increase water intake, mor e so with a n ope n wound. E. Herbal Medicines 1) Consider using herbal medicines onl y after proper training and wh en you lack or h ave limited medi cal supplies. 2) WAR NING Some herbal medicines are dangerous and may cause further da mage or even death. 7. CASUALTY EVAC UATION . Casu alty evacuation in a cold we ather mountainous environme nt wil l require a well thought ou t plan prior to c onduc ting.

(WSVX.02.14e ) When handling animals, whether dead or alive, indivi duals mus t use preventive me asures against possibl e expos ure to wildlife diseases. Althou gh the possibilit y of disease is remote, certain signs may indicate that an a nimal may be diseased. Th e following are some of th e more c ommon diseases found in th e Unit ed St ates and throughout the world. A. Hantaviru s Pulmonar y Syndrome . Hantaviru s, or HPS, is a serious respiratory illness that was first recognized in 1993 in an outb reak in Ne w Mexico and Arizona. I t is caused by a virus th at is carried by a common field rodent called the deer mous e. 1) Method of Transmission . The virus is shed in th e droppin gs, urine, and saliva of the deer mouse. The virus is transmitted to hum ans wh en the material dries, becomes airborne and is inh aled. 2) Signs & Symptoms . The dise ase begins with flu -like symptoms 3 to 45 da ys after exposur e. The disease can rapidly progress into a life-threatening lower respiratory illness ch aracterized b y the floodin g of th e lungs with fluid. 3) Treatment . No cu re or vaccine is y et available against inf ection. T he soone r after infection m edical treatment is sou ght, th e better the chance of recovery. 4) Prevention . Mice should not b e handled; ro dent dens should not b e distu rbed. Package food s o that rodents do not c rawl all over it. Do not occupy shelters that ma y have contained ro dents. B. Plague . The cause of p lague is Y e rs ini a pe stis , a bacterium that is m aintained in n ature through a complex flea-rodent cycle. 1) Method of Transmission . Infection in huma ns results b y flea bites, dir ect contact with pl ague-infected rodents, or direct contact wit h affected non- rodent hosts su ch as rabbits, ha res, cats, and o ccasionally other animals. 2) Signs & Symptoms . Infection in huma ns results in sev ere disease, with a fatality rate of over 50% in unt reated cases. An a bnormal swelling in th e lymph nod es is usually present. 14- 16 WSVX.02.14"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"3) Treatment . Infected people must seek medical treatment. 4) Prevention . Animal noted with fl eas should be avoided. I n a survival situation, a killed animal should be immediately submer ged into a cool water sour ce until al l the fleas are remove b y water or have d ied. C. Tick Borne Diseases . 1) Lyme Dise ase . Infection occurs most often between Ma y and Sept ember. In some cases, a c haracteristic skin rash may develop a t the site of the tick bite. Th e rash may expand to a diameter of 5 inch es or more, and t here may be an accompan ying flu-like illness. If left untreated, inf ection c an lead to ch ronic disease characterized by neurologic impairment, cardiac problems, or arthritis. 2) Rocky Mount ain Spot ted Fever . The incubation p eriod in humans is 2- 14 days. Initial symptoms are flu-like and comm only include f ever, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea, and vomit ing. A rash may appear. The fatality rate in cases that are treated with ant ibioti cs is about 5 % and up to 25% t hat are untreated. 3) Treatment . Infected people must seek medical treatment. 4) Prevention . Daily body inspections should b e conducted to r emove a ll ticks. D. Food Bo rne Dise ases . Food bor ne illness, f requently called “food poisonin g,” is acquired by eating food th at is contaminat ed with micr obes or their toxins. Live animals ma y carry the agent, or contamination m ay occur from another source during processing or preparation o f the food. 1) Botul ism . Botuli sm probabl y is the most widely known a nd is ge nerally caused by imprope r storage of meats. Symptoms may begin with vomiti ng and diarrhea but proceed to th e characteristic impair ed vision a nd descending paralysis. Botulism can be fatal. 2) Salmonella . The bacteria are found in the intestinal tracts and feces of a wide range of animals includi ng poult ry, swin e, cattle, and house hold pets. Salmone lla maybe fatal. 3) Trichinosis . Trichinosis i s caused by a parasite contained within th e muscle ti ssue. Most common carriers are wild sw ine and be ar. Thor ough cooking of meats will destroy the parasite. 4) Tularemia . Disc overed in Tul are County, California. T ularemia has been reported in ov er 45 species of vertebrates; however, the disease most often involv es ticks. I t is als o commonly found in rabbits and ro dents. It is transmittable b y uncooked meats or handling contaminated mea ts with open sores. Tula remia is a life- threatening disease found throughout the world and can onl y be treated wit h antibiotics. 14- 17 WSVX.02.14"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"5) Treatment . Consuming c harcoal will aid in reducing the body’s absorption rate. Medical treatment should b e sought if av ailable. 6) Prevention . Pre vention of food bor ne diseases can be accompli shed by: a) Promptly dress game. b) Avoid o r mini mize contamination by gastrointestinal contents. c) Cook f ood thoroughly. Internal cookin g temperatures should b e 165 degrees F or more. d) Eat cooked foods im mediately. e) Store preserved foods p roperly. E. Anima l Scat . Certain parasites found on sc at can inf ect humans, if the scat is handled unprotected. Rac coon R oundwor m can be found in th e scat for at least 30 d ays, while Fox Roundworm will l ast onl y approximately 7 days on th eir scat. Both of th ese parasites can poss ibly infect human, which is a lmost fatal. REFERENCE: 1. FM 21-76, Survival , 1996. 2. Paul S. Auerbach, Wilderness M edicine , 3 rd Edition, 1995. 3. William R.

The earth is surrounde d by the a tmospher e, which is d ivided into sev eral layers. The world’s weather systems are in th e tropos phere, the low er of these layers. This l ayer reaches as high as 40,000 f eet. B. Dust and clouds in the atmosphe re absorb or boun ce back much of the energy that the sun beams down upon th e earth. Less than one half of the sun ’s energy actually warms the earth’s surface and lowe r atmosphere. C. Warmed air, combined with t he spinnin g (rotation) of the earth, produces winds th at spread heat and mois ture more ev enly around th e world. This is ve ry important b ecause the sun he ats the Equ ator much more than the poles and without winds to h elp restore the balance, much of the earth would b e impossible to liv e on. Whe n the air-cools; clouds, rain, snow, hail, fo g and frost ma y develop. 15- 1"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"D. The weather that you find in a ny place depends on man y things, i.e. how hot the air is, how m oist the air is, how it is being moved by the wind, a nd es pecially, is it being lifted or not? 2. PRESSURE A. All of t hese factors are related to air pressure, which is th e weight of th e atmosphere at any given place. The lowe r the pressure, the more likely are rain and strong wind s. B. In order to understand this we can say that the air in ou r atmosphere acts very much like a liquid. C. Areas with a h igh level of this liquid w ould exert more pr essure on the Earth and be called a “high pressure area”. D. Areas with a lower level would be c alled a “low p ressure area”. E. In order to equalize th e areas of hig h pressure it would have to push out to the a reas of low p ressure. F. The characteristics of th ese two pressure areas are as follows: (1) High-pressure area . Flows out to e qualize pr essure. (2) Low-pressure area . Flows in to e qualize pressure. G. The air from the high-pressure area is basically just tr ying to gradually flow out to equalize its p ressure with the surroundin g air; whil e the low pressure is beginning to build v ertically. Onc e the low ha s achieved equal pressure, it c an’t stop and continu es to build v ertically; causing turbulence, which results in ba d weather. NOTE : When looking on the weather map, you will notic e that these resemble contour lin es. They are called “isobar s” and are translat ed to me an, “equal pressure area”. H. Isobars . Pressure is m easured in millibars o r another more c ommon measu rement - “inches mercury”. I. Fitting enough, areas of hig h pressure are called “ridges” and a reas of low pr essure are called “troughs”. NO T E : The average air pressure at sea level is: 29.92 in ches mercury. 1,013 milli bars. J. As w e go up in elevation, th e pressure (or weight) of the atmosphe re decreases. 2"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"EXAMPLE : At 18,000 f eet in e levation it would b e 500 m illibars vice 1,013 millibars a t sea level. 3. HUMIDITY . Humidit y is the amount of moisture in th e air. All air holds w ater vapor, although it is quit e invisibl e. A. Air can hold only so much water vapor, but th e warmer the air, the more moistur e it can hold. W hen the a ir has all the w ater vapor that it can hold, the air is said t o be saturated (100% relative humidit y). B. If the air is th en cool ed, any excess w ater vapor condenses; that is, it’s mole cules join to build t he water droplets we can see. C. The temperature at whi ch this happens is called the “condensation poin t”. The condensation point v aries de pending on the amount of w ater vapor and the temperature of the air. D. If the air contains a great deal of w ater vapor, condensation wil l form at a temper ature of 20 O C (68 O F). But if the air is rather dry and does not hold much moisture, c ondens ation may not form until th e temperature drops to 0 O C (32 O F) or even b elow fr eezing . E. Adiabatic Lapse Rate . The adiabatic lapse rate is the rate that air will cool on a scent and warm on des cent. Th e rate also varies depending on t he moisture c ontent of th e air. (1) Saturated Air = 2.2 O F per 1,000 fe et. (2) Dry Air = 5.5 O F per 1,000 fe et. 15- 3"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"4. WINDS . As we st ated earlier, the uneven heating of the air by the sun and rotation of the earth causes winds . Muc h of the world’s weather depends on a system of winds that bl ow in a set direction. Thi s pattern dep ends on th e different amounts of sun (heat) that the diff erent regions get and also on the rotation of the earth. A. Above hot surfaces rising air creates a void. C ool ai r move s into an d settles into th e void. The cool air is either warmed up an d begins to rise or it settles. This i s dependent upon the sun’ s thermal energy. The atmosphere is always trying to equalize bet ween h igh pressure and low pressure. On a l arge scale, this fo rms a circulation o f air from the po les along the surface or the earth to the e quator, where it rises and moves tow ards the poles again. B. Once the rotation of t he earth is added to th is, the patt ern of the circulation b ecomes confusing. C. Because of the heating and cooling, along with the rotation of the earth, we have these surfaces winds. All winds a re named from the direction th ey originated from: (1) Polar Easterlies . These are winds from the polar region moving from the east. Thi s is air that has cool ed and se ttled at the poles. (2) Prevailing Westerli es . These winds originate from approximately 30 de grees North Latitude from the wes t. This is an a rea where prematur ely cooled air, due to the earth’s rotation, has settled back to the surface. (3) Northeast Tradewinds . These are winds that originate from approximately 30 de grees North from the Northeast. Also p rematurely cooled air. D. Jet Stream . A jet stream can be defined as a long, mea ndering current of hi gh speed winds near the tropop ause (transition zone b etween the t roposphere and t he stratosphere) blowin g from generally a westerly direction an d often exce eding 250 mil es per hou r. The jet stream results f rom: (1) Circulation o f air around th e poles and Equ ator. (2) The direction of a ir flow above the mid latitudes. (3) The actual path of th e jet stream comes from the west, dippin g down an d picking up air masses from the tropical regions and going north and br inging down air masses from the polar regions. NOTE : The average number of long w aves in the jet stream is between thr ee and f ive depending on the season. Temperatur e differences between polar and tr opical regions influence this. The long wave s influence day to week changes in the weath er; there are also shor t waves that influence hourly changes in the weather . E. Here are some other types of winds th at are peculiar to mountain environments but don ’t necessarily affect the weather: 4"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"(1) Anabatic wind . These are winds that blow up mountain valleys to replace warm rising air and are usually light winds. (2) Katabatic wind . These are winds that blow down m ountain valley slopes caused by the cooling of air and are occasionally strong wind s. 5. AIR M ASSES . As we know, a ll of th ese patterns move air. This ai r comes in p arcels known as “air mass es”. Thes e air mass es can vary in size f rom as small as a town to as large as a country. These air masses ar e named for whe re they originate: A. Maritime. Over water. B. Continental. Over land. C. Polar. Above 60 de grees North. D. Tropical. Below 60 d egrees North. E. Combining th ese give us th e nam es and description of th e fou r types of air masses: (1) Continental Pola r. Col d, dry air mass. 15- 5"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"(2) Maritime Pola r.

As we know, a ir can onl y hold so muc h moistur e dependin g on it’ s temperature. If we cool this a ir beyond its saturation point, it must release this moi sture in one form or another, i.e. rain, snow, fo g, dew, etc. The re are three ways that air can be lifted and c ooled be yond its saturation point. A. Orographic uplift . Thi s happens whe n an air mass is push ed up and ov er a mass of hi gher ground su ch as a mountain. Due to the adiabatic lapse rate, the air is cooled with a ltitude and if it reaches its saturation point we will re ceive precipitation. OROGRAPHIC UPLIFT B. Convention eff ects . Thi s is nor mally a summer effect due to t he sun’s heat radiating off of the surface and causing the air currents to pus h straight up a nd lift ai r to a point of saturation. 6"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"CONVECTION EFFECTS C. Frontal liftin g . As we know w hen two air masses of dif ferent moisture a nd temperature content collide, we have a front. Sinc e the air masses will not mix, the warmer air is forced aloft, from there it is cooled and then reaches its saturation point. F rontal lifting is where we receive the majori ty of our precipitation. A combination of th e different types of lifting is not uncommon. 7. CLO UDS . (WSVX.02.15a) Anytime air is lifted or cooled be yond its saturation point (100% relative humidit y), cloud s are formed. Cl ouds a re one of our sign posts to what is happening. Clouds can be described in man y diffe rent wa ys, they can also be classified b y height or appearance, or even by the amount of area covered, vertically or ho rizontall y. A. Cirrus . These clouds are formed of ice crystals at very high altitudes (us ually 20,000 to 35,000 f eet) in th e mid- latitude s and a re thin, f eathery type clouds . These clouds can give you up to 24 hou rs warning of approaching bad weather, hundr eds of miles in advance of a warm front. Fr ail, scattered types, such as “mar e-tails” or dense cirrus layers, tufts a re a sign of fair weather but p redictive may be a prelude to approaching lowe r clouds , the arrival of p recipitation a nd th e front. B. Cumulus . These clouds are formed due to rising air currents and a re prevalent in uns table air that favors vertical developme nt. These currents of air create cumilifor m clouds that give them a piled or bun ched up a ppearance, lookin g simila r to cotton balls. W ithin the cumulus family there are three diffe rent types to he lp us to forecast the weather: (1) Cotton puffs of c umulus are Fair Weathe r Clouds but should b e obs erved for possible growth into tow ering cumulus and cumuloni mbus. (2) Towering cumulus are characterized by vertical developme nt. Their vertical lifting is caused by some type of lifting action, s uch as convective currents found on hot sum mer afternoons or when wind is fo rced to rise up th e slop e of a mountain or possibly the liftin g action th at ma y be present in a f rontal system. Th e tow ering cumulus has a puffy and “c auliflower-shaped” appearance. 15- 7"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"(3) Cumuloni mbus clouds are characterized in the same ma nner a s the tow ering cumulus , form the familiar “ thund erhead” and produ ce thund erstorm activity. These clouds are characterized b y violent upd rafts which carry the tops of th e clouds to extreme elevations. Tor nadoes, hail and severe rainstorms are all products of this type of cloud. At t he top of the cloud, a flat anvi l shaped form appears as the thund erstorm begins to dissipate. C. Stratus . Stratus clouds ar e formed when a layer of mois t air is co oled below its s aturation point. S tratiform, clouds lie mostly in hori zontal layers or sheets, resisting vertical developme nt. The word stratus is derived from the Latin word “layer”. The stratus cloud is quit e unifo rm and re sembles fo g. It has a fairly uniform base and a dull, g ray appearance. St ratus clouds make th e sky appear heavy and wi ll occasion ally produce fine drizzle or very light snow with fog. However, because there is little o r no ve rtical move ment in th e stratus clouds , they usua lly do not produce precipitation in th e form of heavy rain or snow . 8. FRONT S . (WSVX.02.15b) As we know, f ronts often happen when two a ir masses of different moisture a nd temperature content interact. On e of th e ways we can identify that this is happening is by the progression o f the clouds. A. Warm Front . A w arm front o ccurs when warm air move s into a nd ov er a slow er (or stationary) cold air mass. Sinc e warm air is less dense, it will r ise naturally so th at it will push the cooler air down an d rise abov e it. The cloud y ou will see at this st age is cirrus. From the point where it actually starts rising, you will s ee stratus. As it co ntinue s to ris e, this wa rm air cools by the cold a ir and, this, r eceiving moisture a t the sam e time. As it builds in moisture, it darkens becoming “nimbus -stratus”, which means r ain of thund erclouds. At th at point some type of mois ture will g enerally fall. B. Cold Front . A c old front occurs wh en a cold air mass (colder than the ground th at it is traveling over) overtakes a warm air mass that is stationary or moving slowl y. This cold air, being denser, will go underneath the warm air, pushi ng it higher. Of c ourse, no on e can see this, but th ey can see clouds and th e clouds th emselves can tell us what is 8"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"happening. The cloud pr ogression to look for i s cirrus to cirrocumulus to cumulus and, finally, to cumuloni mbus. C. Occluded Front . Cold fronts move faster than wa rm ones so th at eventually a cold front overtakes a warm one and the warm air becomes progressively lifted f rom the surface. The zone of division b etween cold air ahead and col d air behind is called a “cold occlusion”. If the air behind the front is w armer than ahead, it is a warm occlusion. Most land ar eas expe rience more occlusions th an other types of fronts. I n the progression of clouds l eading to fronts , orographic uplif t can play part in de ceiving you of th e actual type of front, i .e. progression of clouds leading to a w arm front wi th orographic cumulus clouds added to th ese. The progression of c louds in an occlusion is a combinati on of both p rogressions f rom a warm and c old front. 9. USING SIGNS FROM NATURE . (WSVX.02.15c) These signs will give you a general prediction of th e incoming we ather conditions. Try to utili ze as many signs together as possible, which will improve y our prediction. All of these signs ha ve been tested with relative accuracy, but shouldn’ t be depended on 100%. B ut in any case you will b e right more times than wrong in pr edicting the weather. From this we c an gather as much information as needed and compile it along with ou r own exper ience of th e area we are working in to h elp us form a prediction of inc oming we ather. The signs are as follows: 15- 9"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"A. Contrail Lines. A b asic way of identifying a low-pressure area is to not e the contrail lines from jet aircraft.

A gray, overcast evening sky indicates that moisture c arrying dust p articles in the atmosphere have become overloaded with water; this c ondition f avors rain. J. A gray mornin g sky indicates dry air above the haze caused by the collecting of moisture on th e dust in the lower atmosphere; you can reasonably expec t a fair day. K. When the setting sun s hows a green tint at the top a s it sinks be hind clear horizon, fair weather is probable for most of th e next 24 hou rs. L. A rainbow in the late afternoon indi cates fair weather ahead. Howe ver, a rainbow in the mornin g is a sign of p rolonged bad weather. M.

The purpose of th is period of inst ruction i s to intr oduce the student to avalanche and ice hazards, their characteristics, dangers, and ho w to protect yourself from them. OUT L IN E 1. T Y P E S O F AVAL A NCH E : There are four t ypes of avalanches: Loose-snow, Slab, c ornice collapse and Ice. a. Loose-snow Avalanches . Sometim es called point r elease slid es, the y start when a small amount of coh esion l ess snow breaks away and starts to descend dow n the slope. At a distance it will appear to look lik e they start from a point and f an out as they descend. Th ey will start out small and u sually invo lve only the top l ayers. This avalanche is ca pable of being quite large and destructive depending on th e amount of material it will entrain du ring its descent. (1) The stress this av alanche creates during its de scent ma y be enough to trigger larger and deeper slab releases (2) It occurs more oft en on s teep slop e angles of 35 d egrees or higher. (3) It will range in speeds up to 200 mph. b. Slab Av alanches . These avalanches occur when on e or more layers of co hesive snow break away from a sloped snowfi eld at the crown surface. As the slabs travel down slope, they break up into s maller blocks or clods. (1) Slab a valanches begin when the force of gravity pullin g a layer or layers of snow downhill exc eeds the strength of the weakest layer in th e snow p ack. (2) Slabs va ry in size from just a few in ches to ma ny feet thick, and range in width from a few yards to ov er a mil e. Slab ma terial is also highly variable; slabs ma y be hard or soft, w et or dry.

Th e main requirement i s slope angle. Most sl abs fracture on slope angles between 35- 40 degrees. (a) Slopes l ess than 30 d egrees are less lik ely to have slab avalanches because there isn’t enough tension of on th e slab area. (b) Slopes g reater than 45 d egrees usuall y sluff befo re slabs c an form. c. Cornice Collapses . An ove rhang of snow forms when windblown s now builds out horizontally at sharp terrain-breaks su ch as ridge crests and the side s of g ullies. They can break off well back from the edge, and oft en trigger bigger slides when they hit the wind-blown pillowed area of the slop e. d. Ice Avalanches . These are caused by the collapse of unstable ice blocks (seracs) from steep or overhanging parts of a glacier. Ice avalanches can entrain a large amount of rock, ice, and snow a nd travel long distances. These avalanches are not p redictable and c annot be d etected. 2. AV A LAN C H E TRI G GE RS . There are two t ypes: natural and artificial. a. Natural Triggers . These are not triggered directly by man or hi s equipment. A falling cornice, sluffin g snow , stress change due to metamorphis m, avalanche, etc., can all trigger avalanches. b. Artificial Triggers . Ma n or his equ ipment triggers these. A ski pass, a mountainee r's weight, an explosive blast, a sonic boom , etc., com monl y set off avalanches. 3. P A R TS O F AN A VA L ANC H E a. Starting zone . It is usu ally steeper than 30 d egrees and receives large amounts of snow. This is where the unstable snow b reaks loose and starts to slide."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"b. Avalanche Track . Refe rs to th e path und er the starting zone an d above the run out zone. They can be channeled or unchanneled. T he track is th e slop e or channel down which snow move s. (1) Channeled tracks are confin ed areas such as gullies and coul oirs. Unconfin ed tracks are on op en slopes. So me may have trees present. (2) An av alanche track may have several branches or several small tracks ha ving separate starting zones th at ma y feed into one big track. It is important to remember that mult i-branch tracks may run several times in qui ck succession.

The evaluation p rocess is the interaction of fou r critical variables, whi ch he lps determine whether or not, an avalanche is possible. They are snow pack, weather, terrain, and t he human factor. a. The Snow Pack . Is the snow ca pable of sliding? As each storm passes, a new layer of snow is added, some by the wind some not, and e very layer of snow has it’s own textur e and strength. Some layers will be strong while some will be weak. So me will bond well , and some won’t. Although the study of snow metamorphism is a science, Marines must determine if a weak bond in the snow pack exists. Additiona lly, one must attempt to estimate th e amount of snow th at could be potentially released, if triggered. b. The Weather . Is the weather contributing to inst abilit y? It is an obs erved fact that all natural avalanches occur during or shor tly after a storm. Why? The snow pack c an’t handle the new weight being added. This new we ight alters the balance in strength and s tress. The three main contributin g factors are the precipitation, w ind, an d temperature. (1) Signs of I nstability . (a) Recent avalanche activity on si milar slopes and sm all avalanches underfoot. (b) Booming. Th e audibl e collapse of s now layers. (c) Visible cracks shootin g out fr om underfoot. (d) Sluffing debris, whi ch is e vidence of avalanche activity occurring. 17- 3 WSVX.01.01"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"(e) Sunballi ng, which is caused by rapid warming of the snow surface. (f) Weathe r patterns. 1. Heavy amount of s now loading in a short period of time. (1 in/hr for 24 hr period). 2. Heavy rains whi ch wa rms and we akens the snow pack. 3. Significant wind lo ading causing leeward slop es to pos sibly become overloaded. 4. Long, cold, cl ear, calm period follow ed by heavy precipitation or wind loa ding. 5. Rapid temperature rises to above freezing after long a cold period. 6. Prolonged periods (e.g. more th an 24 hr s) of abov e-freezing temperatures. 7. Cold snow t emper atures (equal to o r less th an 25 F) slow down the settlement or strengthening process, thus allowing unstable snow conditions to pe rsist lon ger. (2) Signs of Stab ility . (a) Snow cones or settlement cones form around t rees and ot her obstacles and indicate the snow a round the object is settling. (b) Creep and Glide. Cr eep is the internal deformation of the snow p ack. Glide is slippage of the snow layer with re spect to th e ground. Evidence of these two properties on th e snow pack is a ripple effect at the bottom of a slope. It is an indication that the snow is gaining equilibrium and strength through this t ype of settlement process. (c) Absence of wind dur ing storms which is indicated by snow accumulation in th e trees. (d) Snow tempe ratures remainin g between 25 & 32F ordi narily settles snow rapidly, creating a denser and s tronger snow p ack. c. The Terrain . Being able to recognize avalanche terrain is a critical step in the evaluation pro cess. Assuming that avalanches occur on onl y big slopes is a very common mistake. Ava lanches can occur on an y slope. (1) Slope An gle . Slope a ngle should a lways be factored wh en plannin g move ments in snow cov ered mountainous terrain."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"(a) As the slope angle increases, so does the stress on th e bounda ry regions of a slab. (b) Most slab av alanches release on s lopes with angles between 35 -40 degrees. (c) Loose snow a valanches occur on hi gh angle slopes 60 degrees and above. (2) Slope O rientation . (a) Leeward, wind-l oaded slopes tend to in crease the stress on th e snow pack. (b) Snow packs mode rately hit b y the sun can strengthen and stabilize the snow pack. (c) Direct sunlight has the oppos ite effect by weakening and lubr icating the bonds be tween grains. (d) Weak layers are often well developed or p ersist on sh aded slopes due to the colder conditions a nd ab sence of sol ar warming during the winter. Suspect instabilit y on these slopes. (3) Terrain Rou ghness (Anchoring) . Slopes with a nchors are less likely to avalanche than op en slopes. (4) Vegetation . The most convin cing evidence of past avalanche activity is a p ath of fallen trees, aligned in the same dir ection a nd sh eared at the height above the ground. (a) Trees void of branches on th e uphill s ide, which are called “flagged” trees. (b) Cleared strips of trees in a dense forest. (5) Seasonal .

Temper ature, wind an d precipitation oft en vary significantly with elevation. Co mmon differences include rain at lower elevations or differences in precipitation amounts, or wind sp eed with elevation. N ever assume that condi tions on a slope at a particular elevation r eflect thos e of a slope at a different elevation. (7) Local Popul ation .

Determine s tarting zone s of prob able avalanche prone slopes and c ross as high as possible, preferably above natural anchors. b. Travel on hi gh points an d ridges, especially windwa rd sides. c. When ascending or descending an avalanche prone slope, stay to the side of the start zone and track. d. Avoid wind -loaded, lee slopes. e. Favor terrain with anchors, i.e. tree-covered areas over open slopes. f. Pick a reas with fl at, op en run-outs so that debris burial depth is d ecreased. A void areas that feed into c revasses and cliffs. g. You ca n generally find a safe route somewhe re in a wide U-shaped valley, but n arrow V-shaped one s should be avoided. In V-shaped valleys, avalanches could run from either side and co ntinu e up th e opposit e side, so th ere may be little or no s afe ground. 6. CR O SSIN G A V ALA N CHE P R ONE SLOPES .

Frozen waterways (lakes, streams, and bays) can be life threatening obstacles when crossing. Ice is classified in th ree general types: salt water, fresh water, and land. a. Fresh Water I ce . Fresh wat er ice begins to form on lakes and rivers unde r normal condi tions, f rom 3-5 weeks after the dail y tempe rature drops be low 32F. b. Lake Ice is generally weak in th e areas of st reams, inlets, sp rings, or outl ets. Decaying vegetation on the bottom of a lake may give off a ir bubbl es, which slow i ce formation and create weak ice. c. River Ice formed by warm weather and wind m ay create a rough surface, which will remain ruff throughout the winter. This ice is fille d with air bubbl es. d. Normally, fresh w ater does not fr eeze to a thickness greater than 8 f eet in a single season. I n lakes, the normal ice depth b y late March is b etween 3 1/2 feet and 6 fe et, depending on wint er temperatures."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"(1) The followin g conditions w ill spe ed up f reezing: (a) Low stable tempe ratures.

Special Cons iderations . (1) Immediately adjacent to th e shore, the ice formation is thin a nd weak and more li kely to de velop c racks than ice in the center of a frozen stream. Depending upon th e gradient of t he riverbed and the thickness of the ice near the shore, it is generally safer to maint ain a route n ear the shore if the ice rests upon th e river bott om. (2) Where an und er-ice current of water flows und er a large ice area, the ice in contact wit h the current is subject to a greater variation in t emper ature over a given time, and therefore thicker than the ice in a djacent areas.

Th e Prairie Swift Fox is found in the prairie states of th is count ry. The des ert kit fox is found in the southwestern corner states. Bot h of th ese species are vary curious. Fox habits are very much lik e the coyote. (3) Bobcat and Lynx . Bobcats are generally found in th e west whil e Lynx are found in the northwestern states. They compe te with coyotes and s ometi mes are preyed on by coyotes. Their territory is generally two s quare miles. They den in ro ck caves, deadfalls, hollow tr ees and logs. They are sight hunt ers and use their eyes and ea rs more than the sense of smell. They prefer to kill th eir own food and a void rotten carrion. B obcat can be “pulled” to an area by curiosity lures. They often avoi d large open space. (4) Raccoon a nd Opossum .

Unfo rtunately, the enemy will not consider your MOS when deciding whether or not y ou should be captured or killed . It is imperative that every Marine live up to statement – “every Marine is a basic rifleman.” To di scuss ev ery possi ble surviv al scenario and e nemy situa tion would be pointl ess. The following outlin e is to b e utilized a s a guide. Com mon sense and survi val skills, a long with these considerations, w ill inc rease your chances of avoidin g capture or possibl e death. A. Apply the key word survival (ICBT – 20.01) ( PVTX.14.16 ) 1. Size up the situation:  Mission What was the mission? Can the miss ion still b e accomplished?  Enemy What is the enemy situation?  Troops and Fire Support available Do you have communications w ith higher? Is anyone injur ed? How will they be transpor ted? How will you communi cate with o ther Marines in your group? Arm and Ha nd signals?  Terrain and Weather Do you have a map? Does the terrain offer cover and con cealment? Where is the wat er? Do you have protection from the elements? Is it advantageous to move in current weather? Will you move in daytime or evening temper atures? How much illumination is available at night?  Time, Space, and Logistics Is it day or night? Time Distance Formula What kind of suppli es and equi pment ar e available? 2. Undue haste makes waste:  Should you stay or move from your current pos ition. E- 1 Appendix E"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":" “ Slow is Smooth – Smooth is Fast” i.e. Is there a need to r un to th e SAFE or should the requirements of survival be imple mented in route? Security is paramount -is it b eing sacrificed for speed? 3. Remember where you are:  Are you in a non-permissive environment?  What is the terrain lik e?  Can you utilize land navigation skill s? 4. Vanquish fear and panic:  Are good decisions b eing made?  Is the group c omplet ely lost and l eaderless?  BAMCIS 5. Improvise and improve:  Do you have your survival ki t?  Are litters available or do you have to improvise?  Do you have the r esources to obt ain food a nd wat er?  Will your suppli es an d equipment protect you from the elements?  Will your suppli es an d equipment protect you from the enemy? 6. Value livi ng:  Do you want to lay on your back and put y our legs in th e air like a dead cockroach? 7. Act like the natives:  Observe native habits. 8. Live by your wits, but for now learn basic skills:  Utilize common sense a nd basic Marine Corps t raining.  Practice skills l earned at MWTC .  Prior planning prevents poor perf ormance.  Establish E a nd R plan, bri ef personnel of cont ingencies. B. Additional Individual Training Standards :  Emplo y signaling devices (ICBT – 20.03)  Construct a nd maintain a fire (ICBT – 20.04 )  What is the tactical situation?  Prepare a survival kit (ICBT 20.05) (PVTX.14.15 )  Maintain th e M16A2 service rifle. (PVTX.11.1 )  Prepare individu al equi pment fo r tactical operations. (PVTX.14.1 )  Camoufl age self and individu al equipment. (PVTX.14.7)  Transport casualties using manual c arries and improvi sed stretchers. (PVTX.17.4)  Maintain ph ysical fitness. (PVTX.20.1 )  Perform individu al movem ent. (PVTX.14.2)  Participate in a s ecurity patrol.

Obviously, every effort must be made to accomplish the mission. If it can not b e accomplished a separate mission order mus t be establishe d for the group. ( i.e. At 0900 the group wil l impleme nt the requirements fo r survival in order to move to th e SAFE for recovery.) In order to tactically move and occupy the SAFE, the group mus t be task organized into te ams. The teams are assigned addition al tasks. T eam tasks will usually be accomplished during occupati on of th e patrol base. In addition, individu als within the group ar e assigned tasks. 1. Teams:  Security. All p atrol membe rs should be assigned sectors of fi re to include air sentry.  Reconnaissance.  Assault. (may not b e implemented)  Suppor t. (ma y not be imple mented) 2. Team Tasks:  Water procurement.  Food g athering.  Wood gathering. (construction m aterials, signal, and fire wood. )  Shelt er construction.  Pathguards.  Signaling 3. Individual Tasks:  Point man.  Navigator.  Patrol leader and assistant. E- 3 Appendix E"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":" Flank (l eft and right) security.  Two p ace men.  Tail end ch arlie. In a survival situation it is p robably wiser to o ccupy the patrol base throu gh reconnaissance instead of by force. Upon initi al occupation the acronym SAFE (Security, Automatic we apons , Fields of fi re, Entrenchment) must be enforced. The patrol base should onl y be entered (or exited ) from one location. Communication within th e group is es sential. Eve ryone must be well info rmed. (i.e. current plans, alternate patrol bases or rally point s, how ma ny Marines have departed the patrol base and w hen are they expec ted to r eturn, current challenge and p ass, and ne ar and fa r recognition signals.) N o Ma rine will exer cise their judgement and leave the patrol base or perform a task wit hout permiss ion from the patrol leader. The patrol base is not a pl ace for lollygagging. It is a pl ace where noise and light discipl ine is enforced and security is maintain ed co ntinuousl y. Prio rities of work will b e established a fter occupation. ( i.e. weapon maint enance, hygiene, chow, and r est plans) Sec urity or reconnaissance teams can be sent out to determine enemy threat or gather information for route selection. These patrols can also be tasked with gathering firewood o r some other routine task. H owever, security must be maint ained whil e the firewood is being collected. Since you are probably evading the enemy, activity in and around th e patrol base must be limited. Occupation o f the patrol base must not exc eed 24 hou rs. Depending on th e tactical situa tion th e use of fir e may or may not be appropriate. D. Conclusion: The abov e information servers as a guideline. Surviv al is a thinki ng person’s challenge between life and death. As the s ituation changes a Marine must adapt, size up th e situation, an d imple ment a new plan in order to survi ve. If you are lacking in any of the Individual Training Stand ards it is y our responsibl e to take corrective action. Remember that every Marine is a basic rifleman.
