Prior to class hand out the “Food and Water Storage Survey.” Prior to the first class, ask participants to fill out survey prior to class. This survey may be used as a discussion tool later; as a conclusion to the food storage course; used by the instructor to determine what sections of the food storage book will be most useful; or as the instructor sees fit. It is also helpful for participants to analyze their own storage attitudes and where they need to focus. II. There are many reasons individuals store food. Rather than the instructor making a list to give class members, ask the class participants why they store food. Use the overhead “Why Store Food and Water?” to record the answers participants give as their food storage reasons and attitudes (list common reasons given). One side of the overhead can be used to record storage attitudes; the other side can be used to record answers given by class members in #III “why we eat the f oods we eat.” This discussion will allow the instructor to assess the attitudes and background of participants. It may be helpful for the instructor to list his/her own responses prior to class. (Use overhead for writing down reasons given by participants.) A. B. C. D. E. F. G. H. III. We c hoose to eat the foods we do for a variety of reasons. Once again, ask the class to give their reasons and record answers on the overhead “Why Store Food and Water?” on the second half of the page. Possible answers are listed in the notes below. Instructors may wish to add their own responses. (Overhead—side by side with reasons for storage.) A. Taste—The number one reason we choose to eat the foods we do. B. Culture C. Heritage—Family D. Time E. Money F. Convenience G. Availability H."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" Food Storage Cooking School—Low and Hendricks, USU Extension, Salt Lake County, 1/99. Copies may be made for individual and non-profit use. 2-2 IV. Costly food and water storage attitudes and actions. Use overhead “Cost of Wasted Food and Water Storage” to discuss the loss of money, time, resources when stored food is not used and later thrown out. Answers on the overhead follow. A. Loss of money—may cost more to replace today than it cost yesterday. B. Security loss—if it is spoiled it cannot be eaten; what cannot get past the nose will not be eaten unless extreme starvation circumstances exist—thus no security. C. Quality of food loss—food will never be fresher than it is the day it is stored. D. Loss of self sufficiency—more dependent upon others. V. The following attitudes and actions result in wasted foods. Use overhead “Costly Food and Water Storage Attitudes” to discuss actions associated with food loss. Food stored properly will be a source of security, preparedness, and aid in the management of available resources to the family. A. Saving food and water for use only in time of emergency. B. Storing what someone else outlines (not personalizing). C. Storing foods family does not like and or will not eat. D. Not rotating foods in storage. E. Not developing habits or using skills necessary to utilize storage. F. Placing storage in unaccessible locations. G. Placing storage in adverse storage conditions. H. I. Illustration: Waste present or future . Ask a participant for a $10.00 bill. Ask the participant to tear up the bill. Then ask the participant to throw it away. The participant will be reluctant, alarmed, hesitant, or shocked. Ask the participant how he or she feels about throwing the money away. Discuss with the group why the participant feels this way. Ask the group to show by the raise of hands how many have thrown away food storage in the last week, month, year—for whatever reason. Discuss with the group what are the cost of throwing away food storage. (Wasted time, money, energy, food resources, etc.) Discuss with the group the difference between throwing away food storage because it is too old or throwing away a $10.00 bill. Ask the Question: Are the reasons you eat the foods you do the same as the reasons you store? If not, does your food storage need to be reevaluated in order to “store what you use and use what you store”?"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" Food Storage Cooking School—Low and Hendricks, USU Extension, Salt Lake County, 1/99. Copies may be made for individual and non-profit use. 2-3 VI. Use overhead “Objectives” to discuss the objectives of any food storage program. Those objectives should: A. Help participants manage and balance their resources of time, money, energy, and food. B. Provide practical food storage help in order to use what is stored and store what is used. C. Provide participants with food safety guidelines to ensure a safe and usable storage program. D. Provide participants with food storage guidelines which will maintain the quality of food stored—high nutrition and high eating quality (flavor, texture, color, and odor)."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" Food Storage Cooking School—Low and Hendricks, USU Extension, Salt Lake County, 1/99.

Simple Storage Guides: “Get It Done and Check It Off” This section is included for individuals wishing to check food storage off their list of things to do. It is simple and quick, but a word of caution—any food storage program must be used. No food lasts indefinitely (for more information on shelf life, see the “Shelf Life” section). If food in storage is not used and rotated with fresh items, it will become a waste of time, money, and resources. The very reasons the food was stored (security, obedience, investment, etc.) will be lost. Just because the storage is in the house does not mean the storage is complete. Use it. WHO should store food? It is prudent and wise for every household to have some food stored for use in time of need. We never know what emergency may befall us during which we may not be able to obtain food or drink. The emergency may be loss of job or ability to work due to accident or illness. This may result in a situation where financial resources to purchase food would not be available or may be decreased appreciably. Natural catastrophes such as floods, earthquakes, or storms may result in temporary inability to distribute food to supermarkets. Under these conditions even having money to purchase food does not mean it can be obtained. Even in the United States each of the above conditions occurs occasionally. Because of the possibility of such emergencies the Civil Defense recommends storing food and drink adequate for your family’s needs for a two-week period. Certain church organizations have recommended their members have on hand a year’s supply of food, clothing, and where permitted, fuel, as well as some accessible cash. WHAT constitutes food storage? Food storage is any food stored to be eaten at a later time—4 hours, 4 months, or 4 years. Food storage is any food in the refrigerator, in the freezer, on the shelf, in the garden, on the tree, livestock, etc. WHY store food? There are two main reasons for food storage: (1) To practice wise management of available resources. (2) To provide for ourselves and our family members in an emergency. The big motivator is to avoid hearing a hungry child cry. Even the most “macho” man is distraught if he cannot provide food or beverage to prevent a child from suffering."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" Food Storage Cooking School—Low and Hendricks, USU Extension, Salt Lake County, 1/99. Copies may be made for individual and non-profit use. 3-2 HOW MUCH of WHAT should be stored? ** 1 gallon of water per person per day An individual may be able to survive many days without food, but only a few days without water. Therefore, a recommended amount of water to store is 1 gallon per person per day for about 2 weeks. Most homes contain a 25-60 gallon water heater. This will provide a source of fresh water. It is also recommended you store additional water in food grade containers on a shelf or platform off the floor. Storing additional water outside the water heater is prudent in case the water supply in the water heater becomes contaminated from an outside water source prior to shutting off that outside source. (For additional information on water storage see the “Water Storage” section.) ** 1 pound dry matter per person per day One pound of dry matter provides about 1600 calories of energy. Dry matter may consist of dried beans and legumes, wheat, flour, rice, sugar, dried fruits and vegetables, pastas, dried milk, etc. Because energy is the most critical need (other than water) in a food storage program it must be considered first. Other nutrients such as protein, vitamins and minerals may be sacrificed for short periods of time (up to 3 months) with little ill effect. But since the diet would be very boring if the only thing available to eat were wheat it is advised you include a variety of dried items. (For more information on how much of what should be stored refer to “How to Store What You Use” section.) WHERE food should be stored A chemical law says that for every 10 degree rise in temperature there is a doubling in the rate of a chemical reaction. Thus to have maximum quality food should be stored as cool as possible. In addition to cool temperatures, food should be stored in a clean, dark, and dry space. Ideally this space is in a basement insulated from any heat sources and with restricted light. When ideal conditions cannot be obtained, the time food is left in storage should be shortened. In other words—use it faster. Containers should be food grade. For example, garbage bags, cleaning containers, and kitty litter containers are unacceptable. You should be able to tightly seal all containers holding food to protect food against pest infestation and moisture. (For more information on shelf life and where to store food see sections “Shelf Life” and “Where To Store It.”) WHEN to start storing Start now. Resource management is always beneficial and ever present. Wise storing of food and using food which has been stored will result in savings of time, money, and resources. Emergencies are never predictable. Therefore, to minimize financial burden, food storage should be built up over a period of time, a little at a time as quickly as possible. In order to insure that there is not waste, all items should be labeled and the oldest should be used first. In other words, rotate your food supply to maintain the highest quality possible."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" Food Storage Cooking School—Low and Hendricks, USU Extension, Salt Lake County, 1/99.

Definition: The first step in discussing types of storage and how adequate the storage program is should be to understand what food storage is. Use overhead “Definition.” Food storage is: Any food “saved” to be eaten at a later time (4 hours, 4 days, or 4 years) . Too often we have the tendency to think food storage is wheat or a year’s supply. In the United States we have refrigeration and cupboards making it unnecessary to shop for food daily as is necessary in some parts of the world. If we shop daily, it is our choice and planning. This means just about the entire population has some food storage—even if it is only enough food for one more meal. The object then becomes to analyze how much food is stored and how much of what foods will be needed to fulfill personal storage expectations. II. Diversity: “Don’t place all your eggs in one basket.” This old saying is a warning to the wise. If something happens to one basket, all the eggs are lost. But, if the individual has been wise and used other baskets, the loss is minimal. This principle also applies to food storage. Basically there are three types of storage—Emergency, Survival, and Provident Living. All are important and useful. Each fills different needs. Placing all one’s effort in storing for one type of need may result in insufficient food or the inability to use storage at a time of need. Just as it is important to have storage for different needs, items should be stored by different methods to ensure some food and supplies are available regardless of the circumstances. III. Description: Following is a brief description of each type of storage and its use. A. Emergency—72 hour. Use overhead “Types of Storage,” p. 1 of 3. 1. Usually for very short term emergency of 1 to 3 days duration. 2. Stored food should allow immediate use. 3. This category should include life sustaining items: a. Water (minimum 1 gallon per person per day). b. Energy is the basic requirement—not nutritional value or variety. 4. Should be comprised of foods that require little or no preparation. 5. Store foods familiar and comforting to the individual and family. 6. Foods should be portable. All available food should be considered as food storage, including food in the refrigerator, the freezer, the cupboard, the pantry, the garden, livestock, etc."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" Food Storage Cooking School — Low and Hendricks, USU Extension, Salt Lake County, 1/99. Copies may be made for individual and non-profit use. 4-2 7. Suggest rotating food items every 6 months — this is a good time to evaluate other items in the emergency preparedness pack such as clothing, medicines, etc. For more information on 72 hour emergency kits see handout “ 72 Hour Home Emergency Kit. ” B. Survival — basic, or life sustaining storage. Use overhead “ Types of Storage, ” p. 2 of 3. This is the foundation of food storage. It is good to start with this type of storage when space and money are limited. Basic staples are usually less expensive to purchase than other food items and store fairly well for longer periods of time. 1. Store water first — 1 gallon per person per day for at least 2 weeks. (See “ Water Storage ” section for more information.) Most of the items stored in this type of storage require adequate water to utilize. 2. One pound dry product per person per day. One pound dry product will provide about 1600 calories per day. Dry products include wheat, rice, beans, flour, dried fruits and vegetables, pasta, cereal, etc.) There will be little long lasting ill effects on health if nutritional variety is compromised for less than 3 months. If the stored food is intended to be eaten longer than 3 months, with little or no supplementation, storage should have greater variety of foods in order to balance nutrition. 3. Fulfills longer term needs than emergency. 4. Should include items which store well —“ The Basics ” which store well include wheat, sugar or honey, salt, dry milk, beans, rice, pasta, etc. 5. Suggest rotating every 2-5 years (food stored longer than 5 years is hoarding not storing). Even though these items usually store well, they will not last forever and should be used on a regular basis. Rotation will ensure fresh food; the taste of the food will be familiar and acceptable to the family; and cooking skills, habits, and attitudes will be in place in order to utilize the items stored. C. Provident living storage — Use overhead “ Types of Storage, ” p. 3 of 3. When storage is done properly, provident living becomes a part of the two previous types of storage. It is wisely using all resources — time, money, food, energy, etc. When living providently, you will have or acquire the skills, knowledge, habits, and attitudes to use foods stored and the stored foods will be used. This is true preparedness. Provident living storage includes: 1. Variety of foods — foods should also be stored in a variety of methods. Don ’ t place all your eggs in one basket. Types of storage include foods stored by different methods — frozen foods, dried foods, canned foods, fresh foods, etc. 2. Balanced nutritionally — wise use of the food pyramid as a guide in balancing basic food groups. 3. Foods used daily — foods are familiar to household and a part of daily menus."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" Food Storage Cooking School — Low and Hendricks, USU Extension, Salt Lake County, 1/99.

Skills and knowledge gained and maintained to provide self-sufficiency. 7. Suggest rotating every 1-5 years (food stored longer than 5 years and not rotated is hoarded not stored). Label and date all items stored. IV. Use overhead “ Reasons to Store Food. ” The main reason to store food should be to use it. Properly stored foods and rotated foods will provide: A. Management of resources (time, money, energy, skills, foods, etc.) — providing self sufficiency. B. Preparedness for time of need / want."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" Food Storage Cooking School — Low and Hendricks, USU Extension, Salt Lake County, 1/99.

Current Storage: “How Much Food & Water Storage Do You Now Have?” Nutrition Inventory Teaching Notes How nutritionally balanced is the food you have stored and how much food and water do you have stored? This section will walk you through a five-step worksheet to assist you in analyzing your current storage, and determining how nutritionally balanced your storage is. 1. Use overhead “Food Storage Pyramid.” The Food Storage Pyramid is an adaption of the USDA’s Food Pyramid. It is the current visual presentation of what research has been saying for many, many years—eat a variety of foods and drink plenty of water. Each group contains some nutrients, but not all. No one food group is more important than another. Some foods are needed in larger quantities than other groups. The visual shape of the pyramid also helps individuals see which groups are needed in larger quantities. 2. Using the handout “Food Storage Inventory” evaluate your current storage according to household needs. Step #1: Determine number of servings from each food group needed. Use overhead “Daily Requirements.” Different people need different amounts of food from each food group. The following chart outlines how many servings are needed in each food group based on the individual’s gender and activity level. Look across the top of the chart and select the category that best describes your activity level and your sex. Follow that column down and note the number of servings for each group. If you fall between categories, split the difference between the number of servings for the two groups. NOTE: * Children, 8 years old and younger, have the same number of serving requirements, but a serving is half the size of an adult serving. Step #2: Determine the total nutritional needs for the entire family according to servings per day. Use overhead “Daily Servings.” Nutritional needs will change as family members age or activity level changes. Update Nutritional Needs chart every 1-3 years, or as needed. Begin by dating the chart. List each family member by name in the left hand column. Add to the list any and all individuals you are responsible for (grandparents,"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" Food Storage Cooking School — Low and Hendricks, USU Extension, Salt Lake County, 1/99. Copies may be made for individual and non-profit use. 5-2 parents, foster children, etc.). Figure the nutritional needs of each family member using Step 1 and record the number of servings each needs on the chart under the appropriate food group. Total the servings in each food group column and multiply by 365 days. This will give you the number of servings from each food group needed to feed your family for 1 year. Step #3: Inventory Food Storage. Use overhead “ Servings per Group Inventory Sample. ” Analyze your food storage according to the Food Groups. Each of the Food Groups is listed on a separate page of the handout. Examples of foods in each group are listed in the first column with the serving size in parentheses. The next column gives the Serving Size weight or volume for that example. Inventory your storage and record how much of each food you have on hand in the “ Amount on Hand ” column. If a food is a combination item, for example canned chili with tomato sauce, record it under the food group it most fits. The product has both a vegetable (tomato sauce) and a protein item (chili beans). The chili is primarily beans and thus falls under the protein group — canned beans and legumes. There may be items in your storage not listed on the handout. Add them to the list; use the extra page at the end of the handout, or use a blank sheet of paper. The end of the handout is a page of weights and measures to assist with this process. Divide the amount on hand by the proper serving size, measure (either weight or volume) and record that number under the “ Amount on Hand ” (Servings column). If desired, make notes on age of the product to the far right. At the bottom of each table, add up total number of servings on hand for that food group. Subtract the number of servings needed for 1 year (Step 2). The result is an overview of your 1 year storage for that particular food group. Continue with each group. This inventory will help to determine what areas your storage is lacking and examples of foods which could be added to “ beef up ” your program. To assist in planning additional storage see “ How To Store What You Use ” section 6. Step #4: The Other Group. The tip of the food pyramid is made up of added fats, sugars, and salt. These foods should be eaten with wisdom and control. Often they are an ingredient in another dish (oil, sugar, salt, mayonnaise, etc.). These items, as well as other ingredient items used in cooking (baking powder, soda, etc.), are a part of food storage, but the amounts vary greatly according to the cooking habits and skills of the one preparing the food or the particular dish. For example, if canning fruit and using sugar in the process is a normal activity, that household would need significantly more sugar in storage than someone who does no home food"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" Food Storage Cooking School — Low and Hendricks, USU Extension, Salt Lake County, 1/99. Copies may be made for individual and non-profit use. 5-3 preservation. Step 4 is to assess how much of these other items are needed. One easy way to determine how much of what is needed is to date the container when it is opened. When the container is empty figure the number of days needed to use the product. Divide the number of days into 365. The answer is the number of that size containers needed of that product. Some examples are on the worksheet. Step #5 : Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of your storage. Set a goal and a plan to address these strengths and weaknesses.

All food storage should be rotated and used. This worksheet is to help assess the nutritional balance and adequacy of one ’ s food and water storage. Food groups have long been a way to help consumers choose a diet which contained a variety of foods. Currently the Food Guide Pyramid is a visual presentation of basic food groups and the number of servings needed by the body for good health. Each group contains some nutrients, but not all. No one food group is more important than another. The Food Pyramid is also an excellent way to provide balance and variety in a food storage program. Using the Food Guide Pyramid follow each step below to assess your household needs and compare your needs to proven guides to nutritional adequacy. Step #1. Determine Number of Servings Needed Different people need different amounts of food from each food group. The following chart outlines how many servings are needed in each group based on individual ’ s gender and activity level. Look across the top of the chart and select the category that best describes your activity level and gender. Follow that column down and note the number of servings for each group. If you fall between categories, split the difference between the number of servings for each group.

Needs will change as family members age. Update Nutritional Needs every 1-3 years, or as needed. Begin by dating the list. List each family member and all individuals you are responsible for (grandparents, parents, foster children, etc.) Record the servings in each food group for that family member. Total the servings in each food group and multiply by 365 days. This is the number of servings from each food group needed to feed your family for 1 year.

Each of the Food Groups is listed on the following pages. Examples of foods in each group are listed in the first column with the serving size in parentheses. The next column gives the Serving Size weight or volume for that example. Inventory your storage and record how much of each food you have on hand in the “ Amount on Hand ” column (under Wt or Vol column). For help in determining the amount you have on hand see the weights and measures page at the end of the handout. Divide the amount on hand by the proper serving size measure (either weight or volume) and record the amount under the “ Amount on Hand. ” If desired, make notes on age of the product to the far right.

Fat, sugar, salt and other ingredients add variety, flavor, and appeal to many dishes. These items are usually not consumed individually, but as a part of something else. Many of the foods found in the five main food groups contain fat, sugar, and salt. There may be enough in those foods to supply a year ’ s need without separate storage, thus specific amounts have not been listed. The amount needed per household will vary depending upon cooking style. For example: home canning, bread making, baking, frying of foods, etc., will require additional amounts of these items to be stored. Following is a partial list, add items you use on a regular basis. The best way to determine the amount needed for a year ’ s supply is to date the package as it is opened. Notice the date when the container is used. Divide the days it took to use the container into 365 days. This will tell you the number of containers (of that size) needed for a year ’ s supply. Food Possible Uses Amount Needed Amount on Hand Yeast baking Salt seasoning Sugar baking, canning, cooking, etc Baking Powder baking Butter frying, baking Shortening “ ” Oil “ ” Baking Soda Mayonnaise, etc Jello Cornstarch Step #5: Evaluate and Set a Goal After reviewing your inventory of food storage identify your household weaknesses and strengths. Are the foods stored being eaten and rotated? Are they foods you like and will eat? Are some foods too old? Do they have variety in color and texture? A year supply need not be a single item, but rather a variety of foods. The next step is to determine the types of foods needed in order to complete your storage. To build your storage to reflect what you actually eat, create a menu of foods eaten. This process is explained in detail in the “ How to Store What You Use ” section, and “ How to Build Storage ” section."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" Food Storage Cooking School — Low and Hendricks, USU Extension, Salt Lake County, 1/99.

Food storage is any food saved to be eaten at a later time— 4 hours, 4 days, or 4 years. Storage includes food in the refrigerator or freezer, vegetables in a garden or fruit on a tree, livestock, or food stored in a storage room. Management of this food is a vital part of food storage. Food is perishable even when stored properly under the most favorable circumstances and conditions. Food which is not a normal part of the diet will more likely not be used and more likely be wasted at a later date. Properly storing and rotating food will maximize nutritional quality, eating quality, and eliminate waste. 2. This section is an exercise in planning food storage based on Provident Living Storage (see Types of Storage section). It is intended to provide an easy way to analyze meal planning, food preparation and storage in the home in order to “store the foods your family eats and use the foods you store.” The worksheet exercise is based on the idea that one should store the foods which are regularly eaten and are a part of the family eating patterns. Working through the steps will also give an overall view of eating habits including information of nutritional value of meals, shopping techniques and food preparation skills. 3. This plan assumes there is adequate space to store moderate amounts of food in various forms and is based on a year’s planning time (see Where to Store It section for ideas on where to store food). This is not a perfect planner, but rather a tool to use in planning foods to “store what you use.” a. Personalize it. The lists generated in this exercise should reflect your lifestyle, needs, preferences and circumstances. It will not work if it is the storage list of friends, relatives, or a list you feel others think you should have. b. Use this process to plan 80-90% of your year’s storage needs. The remaining 10- 20% may be made up of foods eaten less frequently such as at celebrations, holidays, special meals, etc. c. Re-do the process as family needs change, or every few years, to maintain accuracy. For example: children growing up, changing diet requirements, addition of family members, etc. d. The method usually does not take into account foods such as desserts and snacks, unless you plan them into the menu. 4. Use the handout “Food Storage Planner” as teaching notes. Walk through each step with participants. It may be wise to do Step 1 and allow participants time to complete before moving on to Step 2. Use overhead “Sample Planner” for illustration."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" Food Storage Cooking School—Low and Hendricks, USU Extension, Salt Lake County, 1/99. Copies may be made for individual and non-profit use. 6-2 Handout “Food Storage Planner” Store What You Use Worksheet Instructions 1. Step #1: Create a list of 10 to 20 meals. a. Use the handout “Food Storage Planner.” In the first column of the handout list the dishes frequently eaten, or create a list of favorite meals. Studies show families will eat the same main dishes about 80% of the time. b. Begin the planning process by focusing on the main meal eaten during the day, for example, dinner or supper. The same process may be repeated for breakfast and lunch foods, as appropriate and if desired. c. Brainstorm a list of 10 to 20 different dishes. The more meals you have on your list the greater the variety in your diet. At first you may not think of many foods. Post the list in a prominent place in your kitchen for two weeks. Each time you think of a new dish—write it on the list. Involve the family, ask for their ideas and suggestions. Make the list reflect what your family typically eats and enjoys. 2. Step #2: Evaluate the list. a. Evaluate current diet pattern—is it storable? Is it realistic? Will the family eat it? Fast food and TV dinners are not ideal storage items. Elaborate and time- consuming meals may not be practical storage for the day-to-day life. Adjust your list of meals, as needed, to reflect practical meals. b. Should the number of items that do not store well be reduced? c. Could the items that do not store well be replaced by a similar dish made at home? 3. Step #3: Balance the dish to make a nutritional meal. a. Go back over the list and add foods needed to make the meal balanced. See sample at the end of instructions or use teaching overhead “Sample Planner” For example, Tuna Noodle Casserole needs a vegetable. By adding peas to the list the meal has more variety and has better balance. b. Write the additional foods after the main dish item. c. Add foods, as needed, from the bread and cereal group, fruit group, vegetable"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" Food Storage Cooking School—Low and Hendricks, USU Extension, Salt Lake County, 1/99. Copies may be made for individual and non-profit use. 6-3 group, milk and dairy group, meat group. Review the Food Guide Pyramid for suggestions. 4. Step #4: Identify specific food items needed for each meal by reviewing the recipe(s) used to make the dishes . In the example, Tuna Noodle Casserole may include tuna, noodles, cream soup, etc. Determine how much of each ingredient is needed. a. In the columns to the right of your list of dishes, identify major categories of ingredients used in your meals. For example, meats, soups, vegetables, fruits, bread and cereals, etc. Additional blank pages have been included as a part of the handout for your convenience. These pages may be duplicated on an 11x17 page or tape a couple of pages together to extend the space needed for this step. b. In the space underneath each category write the specific food items needed. For example, under meats you may have canned tuna, under soups you may have cream mushroom, under vegetables you may have frozen peas, etc. c. Continue down each column and write the amount of food needed for each dish on your list of meals. d. When completed with the steps above, add the amounts of food needed in each column and total at the bottom of the page. (See example at the end of instructions.) 5. Step #5: Figuring amounts needed for the year. Plan 80% of your meals with this process. The remainder of the year’s meals and storage will include foods eaten less frequently, short term seasonal foods, special meals, holiday dinners, and long term basic storage items needed to sustain life such as beans, rice, wheat, etc. a. Eighty percent of 365 days is 292. Divide the total number of dishes or meals from Step 1 into 292. This is the number of times each year you are likely to prepare any one of these dishes. If the number of times you are scheduled to eat “stew,” or some other dish not to your liking according to this method, adjust. b. Multiply each food totaled in the column in Step 4 by the answer above. This will give you the amount of that specific food item needed in your storage to supply about 80% of the year’s need. These stored items will reflect the dishes you eat most often in your home, and you will more likely eat the foods you have stored. Re-do the process as family needs change, or every few years, to maintain accuracy. For example, children growing up, changing diet requirements, addition of family members, addition of new favorite meals, etc."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" Food Storage Cooking School—Low and Hendricks, USU Extension, Salt Lake County, 1/99.

Water Storage Teaching Notes Our abundant domestic water supply is generally of little concern. However, situations might occur when the supply of safe water is interrupted or becomes contaminated. Interruptions could be for only short periods of time, or natural disasters such as earthquakes could occur which would result in an inadequate or contaminated water supply for days. An emergency water supply is recommended in every household to meet these situations. (Use overhead “Water Storage.” ) I. AMOUNT OF WATER FOR STORAGE a. Only a short-term supply of water can be stored in most homes. One gallon per person per day for about 2 weeks time is a rule of thumb. Recommendations for the amount of water to be stored vary from ½ gallon to 1 gallon per person, for food preparation and drinking purposes only. 1. The Department of Defense, Office of Civil Defense, states that a quart of water or other fluid a day will sustain life, but humans would be much more comfortable, especially in warm weather, with an allowance of a gallon per day. 2. An additional ½ to 1 gallon per day is recommended for washing, teeth- brushing, and dishwashing. b. The amount of water for consumption might be reduced somewhat, depending on the total juices, soups, other drinks, and high moisture foods which are available. c. Water storage may need to be increased in humid locations or if individuals who may use the water will be involved in strenuous activity. d. Other sources of water available in emergency situations are the water heater, water softener containers, and the water storage area of the toilet. II. CONTAINERS FOR WATER STORAGE Many types of containers are available for water storage. The most commonly used containers are glass, plastic, and metal. a. Glass: Glass provides a fairly effective container for storage but is easily broken and heavier than plastic. Glass is non-permeable to vapors and gases; however, water in glass containers should not be stored near gasoline, kerosene, pesticides, or similar substances. b. Plastic: Plastic jugs are frequently used for water storage. These containers are light weight and fairly sturdy. There are many types of plastic containers manufactured. Generally polyethylene type plastics are safe for storing water."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":" Food Storage Cooking School—Low and Hendricks, USU Extension, Salt Lake County, 1/99. Copies may be made for individual and non-profit use. 7-2 They include pop bottles, commercial water storage bottles and bags. 1. Acceptable and safe plastic containers: a. Containers which have previously been used for food storage—pop bottles, fruit bottles, syrup bottles, etc. (must be thoroughly cleaned). b. Containers which are advertised as food storage products. c. Containers must have secure lids. 2. Plastic containers not recommended. Some plastic containers are not recommended for food storage because harmful chemicals could leach into the food, either the chemicals in the plastic or the chemicals the container previously held. a. Most plastics used in waterbeds are not approved food storage plastics, but perhaps the water could be used for bathing. b. Chlorine bleach bottles may be a food approved plastic, but contain an anti-static agent which prevents accumulation of dust during storage and are thus not recommended. c. Milk jugs are safe for water storage if they have been thoroughly washed; however , the seams may split and the jugs frequently leak over time. 3. Since plastic is permeable to certain vapors, water stored in plastic should not be kept near gasoline kerosene, pesticides, or similar substances. 4. It is advisable to store plastic water containers away from direct sunlight. c. Metal: Some metals, such as stainless steel, can be successfully used for water storage. A metal water storage container should be resistant to rust. A metallic taste can be picked up by the stored water in some types of metal containers. Water stored in metal containers should not be treated with chlorine prior to storage because the chlorine compound is corrosive to most metals. III. TREATMENT FOR STORED WATER (Use overhead “Treatment Methods.” ) Water which is to be stored for long periods of time should be sanitized or disinfected. Be sure to use the best quality water possible for storage. Water from a system with a State Division of Health “approved” rating is recommended. If the public water system is chlorinated, it is unnecessary to further treat the water for storage. The containers should be clean. Pay special attention to the container lids. They should be sanitized to the same extent as the container. If treatment is necessary to sanitize and disinfect water for long term storage, follow one of methods below."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" Food Storage Cooking School—Low and Hendricks, USU Extension, Salt Lake County, 1/99. Copies may be made for individual and non-profit use. 7-3 Chlorine Treatment: Liquid chlorine bleach can be used to disinfect water for long-term storage. One gallon can be treated by the addition of ¼ teaspoon of liquid chlorine bleach containing 4 to 6 percent sodium hypochlorite. (Most bleaches contain 5.25 percent.) This is equivalent to 16 drops of liquid chlorine bleach. (Storing water in empty bleach bottles is not recommended.) IV. EMERGENCY DISINFECTION OF WATER (Use overhead “Emergency Disinfection.” ) Some emergency situations could occur if the only water which is available is contaminated by disease-causing organisms. In this case, the same procedures can be used as for treatment of stored water as follows: a. Heat Treatment: Boiling is the most preferred method. This heat treatment requires water to be boiled in a vigorous rolling boil for 5 minutes . Taste may be improved by pouring the boiled water back and forth from one clean container to another several times to incorporate air. b. Chemical Treatment: Chemical treatment is less desirable than heat treatment because the effectiveness depends on several variables such as: (1) the amount of organic matter in the water, (2) the amount and type of chemical used, (3) water temperature, and (4) the length of time after the chemical is added until it is used. 1. Chlorine Treatment: Clear water can be treated with 1/4 teaspoon (16 drops) of liquid chlorine bleach per gallon. Mix the water and allow to stand for 30 minutes before using. If water is cloudy in appearance, chemical treatment is not recommended. A slight chlorine odor should be detectable in the water. If not, repeat treatment and let stand an additional 15 minutes before using. Use fresh bleach. 2. Water Purification Tablets: Different types of tablets are available for water purification purposes. Be sure to follow the manufacturer’s directions for treatment and allow sufficient time for the chemical to work before using. Check the label for expiration date, since the tablets can become ineffective with time. Most tablets have a storage life of approximately 2-5 years unopened."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":" Food Storage Cooking School—Low and Hendricks, USU Extension, Salt Lake County, 1/99.

Commercial Water Treatment Units: (Use overhead “Commercial Units.” ) Many extravagant claims are made by some water filter manufacturers concerning their ability to purify water. According to the Utah State Division of Health, concerning the effectiveness of their use, the following is quoted: V. SHELF LIFE Stored water should be checked occasionally, at least annually. If any changes, such as cloudiness or an odor, are noted replace the water and treat as before. VI. CONTAMINATION BY RADIOACTIVITY & CHEMICALS No effective way for decontamination of water which contains radioactive or chemical fallout is available for home use. This decontamination should be supervised by the local or the state health officers. “In the emergency situation, neither these nor any other presently known home-use device can be relied upon to produce safe drinking water from any or all contaminated waters.

There are inevitable changes that all nature (including food) must pass through. For food storage the questions then become “how old is too old” and “how do you tell if it is too old”? The following points help you determine whether to keep or to discard stored food. I. Safety of Stored Foods Safety of food should be and usually is the first consideration in shelf life. As food ages it naturally will change in flavor, odor, and texture. The worse these conditions are the less likely we will be to eat a particular food, but if it were safe to begin with, and it passes the following food safety test now, then it should be safe. Always a good rule of thumb to follow is “When in Doubt—Throw It Out.” Refer to handout “Shelf Life of Stored Foods,” use overhead “Safety Checklist.” A. Was the food processed properly? If improper processing times, methods, and/or recipes were used for home canned vegetables and meats, the jar may be sealed, but the product deadly —DO NOT TASTE—discard. B. Are there signs of spoilage? Look for the following signs of spoilage, if any are present—DO NOT TASTE—discard: 1. Bulging lid—lid must be a definite concave, and seal cannot be lifted with fingers. 2. Milky appearance to liquid—as food ages the liquid will become more cloudy and a residue will begin to form in bottom of jar. This is the food sluffing off, but the appearance should not be milky . 3. Mold growth of any kind. 4. Slimy appearance or texture. 5. Rancid odor—especially in foods which contain any amount of fat, like dehydrated meat, eggs, or protein products. 6. Corrosion on inside of can, especially along seam (this is a particular problem with canned foods older than 10 or more years). 7. Rust—especially on seam or seal of can. 8. Frozen can or bottle—freezing produces hairline fractures in seal and allows spoilage to begin. If a can of food were accidently frozen, keep it frozen until time to use. Once the can thaws, the food will begin to spoil, but dramatic evidence of spoilage may not be visible for a time. Just because spoilage cannot be seen, does not lessen the fact it is there and harmful. 9. Off-smell—food generally changes in odor as it ages, if the smell has developed to the point it is undesirable, discard."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":" Food Storage Cooking School — Low and Hendricks, USU Extension, Salt Lake County, 1/99. Copies may be made for individual and non-profit use. 8-2 C. Was the food stored in a proper container? Containers are constructed from different chemicals. Some of these chemicals can leach out into food, if food comes in contact with them. If the containers were intended for food, but other non-food products were stored in them, chemicals from these products could also leach into the food. For this reason, only food grade, moisture-proof, puncture proof, air-tight containers are acceptable. Unacceptable containers for food storage include garbage cans, garbage bags, cleaning containers, kitty liter containers, etc. New galvanized garbage cans lined with a food-grade liner (it must say it is acceptable for food on the package) would be an acceptable way to store large quantities of grains and other foods. II. Quality of Stored Foods If the individuals intend to consume the food cannot get it past their noses and mouths the storage will be of no benefit to them. Quality becomes the second consideration of food storage. Quality is defined by texture, color, taste, and odor. As food ages, quality will continue to decrease making it more and more unacceptable. Texture will become softer, color will darken, taste will intensify in some foods (like honey) and decrease in others (like spices), and odor will change. Changing odor should not be confused with a spoiling odor. Sometimes the undesirable characteristics of old food may be camouflaged by the way the food is prepared — adding spices, pureeing, combining with another food, etc. See handout “ Using Old Stored Food ” for recipe ideas using old foods. Because quality deteriorates over time, it is important to select high quality food products for storage in the first place. If the food is unacceptable in quality now, discard it. Time will not improve it. To demonstrate the differences in the quality of stored foods use the Demonstration “ Quality of Stored Foods ” at the end of this section. III. Nutritional Value of Stored Foods Sugar is the only item stored that is almost purely one chemical compound (sucrose). All other foods are various blends of minerals, carbohydrates, proteins, lipids (or fats), vitamins, and water. Since nutrients in foods deplete at various rates, store (and eat) a variety of foods. When considering nutrient loss in a specific food item it is best to consider the primary nutrient(s) for which that food was stored in the first place. A. Minerals and carbohydrates change very little in stored foods. While there are small changes, they are biologically insignificant. So in other words, if a food is stored primarily for its mineral and carbohydrate content, nutrition will be little affected by age and adverse storage conditions. B. Proteins change in the way they react in a recipe. For example, old wheat flour will not rise when used in bread because the ability of the proteins to form gluten has been destroyed. C. Fats undergo enzymatic changes, or oxidize (become rancid) creating off odors and flavors. The higher the fat content the shorter the shelf life. D. Vitamins are susceptible to destruction by heat, light, and oxidation. Some foods have high levels of particular vitamins and can still provide the needed daily supply even after loss due to age. For example, tomatoes stored 4 years lose 10%-"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":" Food Storage Cooking School — Low and Hendricks, USU Extension, Salt Lake County, 1/99. Copies may be made for individual and non-profit use. 8-3 20% of their vitamins A and C. However, tomatoes contain so much more of both of these vitamins that even when stored for several years, they still have much higher vitamin content than other foods (such as fresh applesauce). A good rule of thumb is to eat a variety of foods. IV. Storage Conditions A. Storage conditions for canned or dehydrated foods should be cool, dark, and dry . (Use overhead “ Dry Conditions. ” ) Shelf life of food is dependent on storage temperatures, light, and humidity. The warmer the temperature, the brighter the room, and the more humid the room the shorter the shelf life — in quality, safety, and nutrition (see above). The Quartermaster Corps of the United States military have established a storage life of 48 months for most dehydrated foods stored at 70 º F. Temperatures above 70 º F will shorten shelf life. For example, non-fat dry milk shelf life is 18 months to 2 years, but when stored at 90 º F the odor of the milk will be dramatically affected and may shorten the life to as low as 3 months. 1. Cool — ideal temperature is 50 º F (range between 50 º - 70 º F). 2. Dark. 3. Dry — between 50-60% humidity. Keep foods off cement floors and away from outside walls to prevent condensation. B. Storage conditions for frozen foods should be as cold as possible (0 degrees or lower is ideal) and frost free (use overhead “ Frozen Conditions ” ). 1. Frost free freezers are great to cut back defrosting work, but they also compromise the quality of the food stored. The principle behind frost free is a melting and evaporating in order to rid the freezer of undesirable frost build up. (If the frost is being eliminated then the moisture from the food is also being eliminated.) 2. Freeze foods in airtight moisture proof containers. 3. The lower the temperature (ideal is 0 degrees), the harder the freeze, the slower the deterioration of the food. Freezing does not preserve food indefinitely, it just slows down the deterioration process. 4. Most frozen foods should be used within 6 months to 1 year for optimum quality. The longer the food is frozen the more likely it will freezer burn and absorb flavors and odors. V. Discarding Old Food If safety is questionable, place food in a closed container and discard in garbage cans away from pets, animals, and children. If safety is not in question, but quality and nutrition is undesirable, discard in the following manner: A. Compost pit. B. Spread on garden to compost. C. Feed to livestock (small or large). D. Discard at public landfill. E. If safety of the food is not in question , consider donating unwanted but desirable food to food banks or pantries."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" Food Storage Cooking School — Low and Hendricks, USU Extension, Salt Lake County, 1/99. Copies may be made for individual and non-profit use. 8-4 VI. Using Old Food Food which is safe and the quality still high enough to be desirable to someone (not everyone has the same taste buds and preferences) try the following solutions (see handout “ Using Old Stored Food ” ): A. Fruit leather — puree, season to taste, spread thinly on plastic wrap lined drying trays and dry. B. Use in baked goods. Puree and use as an added ingredient in the recipe, or puree may replace part of the fat/oil called for in the recipe (see recipes). C. Make a smoothie by pureeing fruit, mixing yogurt, ice cream, etc, and season to taste. Makes a nice breakfast replacement. D. Use smaller amounts. If the taste is strong try using the food item as a secondary ingredient in other dishes (small amounts are not as easily detected as when the food is used as the primary ingredient). For example, the taste of old dry milk made into a smoothie may be detected by discriminating taste buds, but the taste of old dry milk used in a pancake mix may be unnoticed. VII. How Old Is Too Old? In conclusion, the shelf life depends on three things: safety, quality, and nutrition. Once safety has been determined, the food must be desirable enough to be consumed. A. Food stored longer than 5 years may be hoarding — not storing. B. Most dry or canned food stores fairly well for 2 years. C. Most dry or canned storage guidelines indicate storage time for optimum quality."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" Food Storage Cooking School — Low and Hendricks, USU Extension, Salt Lake County, 1/99.

Safety : As food ages it naturally will change in flavor, odor, and texture. The worse these conditions are the less likely we will be to eat a particular food, but if it were safe to begin with, and it passes the following food safety test now, then it should be safe. A good rule of thumb is “ When in Doubt — Throw It Out. ” The following chart gives throw away guidelines. 1. Food was not processed properly. If improper processing times, methods, and/or recipes were used for home canned vegetables and meats, the jar may be sealed, but the product deadly — DO NOT TASTE — discard. 2. Look for the following signs of spoilage — DO NOT TASTE — discard: a. Bulging lid — lid must be definite concave, and seal cannot be lifted with fingers. b. Milky appearance to liquid — as food ages the liquid will become more cloudy and a residue will begin to form in bottom of jar — this is the food sluffing off, but the appearance should not be milky . c. Mold growth of any kind. d. Slimy appearance or texture. e. Rancid odor — especially in foods which contain any amount of fat, like dehydrated protein. f. Corrosion on inside of can, especially along seam (particular problem with canned foods older than 10 years or so. g. Rust — especially on seam or seal of can. h. Frozen can or bottle — freezing produces hairline fractures in seal and allows spoilage to begin. i. Off-smell — food generally changes in odor as it ages, if the smell has developed to the point it is undesirable. j. Food stored in non-food grade container — the container was not meant for food or once contained a non-food product (garbage bags, garbage cans, cleaning bottles or buckets, kitty liter containers, etc.)."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" Food Storage Cooking School — Low and Hendricks, USU Extension, Salt Lake County, 1/99. Copies may be made for individual and non-profit use. 8-11 Quality is defined by texture, color, taste, and odor. As food ages the quality will continue to decrease making it more and more unacceptable. Texture will become softer, color will darken, taste will intensify in some foods (like honey) and decrease in others (like spices), and odor will change. Changing odor should not be confused with a spoiling odor. Sometimes the undesirable characteristics of old food may be camouflaged by the way the food is prepared — adding spices, pureeing, combining with another food, etc. See recipes for using old foods. Because quality deteriorates over time, it is important to select high quality food products for storage in the first place. If the food is unacceptable in quality now, discard it — time will not improve it. Look for plump intact kernels of storage grains, brightly colored dehydrated foods, textures of all foods. Nutrition : Sugar is the only item stored that is almost purely one chemical compound (sucrose). All other foods are various blends of minerals, carbohydrates, proteins, lipids (or fats), vitamins, and water. When considering nutrient loss in food storage it is best to consider the primary nutrient(s) the food was stored for in the first place. Minerals and carbohydrates change very little in stored foods. While there are small changes, they are biologically insignificant. So in other words, if a food is stored primarily for its mineral and carbohydrate content, nutrition will be little affected by age and adverse storage conditions. Proteins change in the way they react in a recipe. For example, old wheat flour will not rise when used in bread because the ability of the proteins to form gluten has been destroyed. Fats undergo enzymatic changes, or oxide (become rancid) creating off odors and flavors. The higher the fat content the shorter the shelf life. Vitamins , on the other hand, are susceptible to destruction by heat, light, and oxidation. Some foods have high levels of particular vitamins and can still provide the needed daily supply even after loss due to age. For example, tomatoes stored 4 years lose 10%-20% of their vitamins A and C. However tomatoes contain so much more of both of these vitamins that even when stored for several years they still have much higher vitamin content than other foods (such as fresh applesauce). A good rule of thumb is eat a variety of foods. Storage Conditions Storage conditions should be cool, dry, and dark . Shelf life of food is dependent on storage temperatures, light, and humidity.

For example, non-fat dry milk shelf life is 18 months to 2 years, but when stored at 90 º F the odor of the milk will be dramatically affected and may shorten the life to as low as 3 months.

Unacceptable containers for storage include garbage cans, garbage bags, cleaning containers, kitty liter containers, etc. New galvanized garbage cans lined with a food- grade liner (it must say it is acceptable for food on the package) would be an acceptable way for storing large quantities of grains and other foods. Be cautious when using containers which are food grade, and once held food — but the food had a strong odor or flavor. For example: empty pickle bottles collected from food service establishments (restaurants, schools, etc.) are acceptable storage containers, but they may make the food stored in them smell and taste like pickles. Shelf Life Times Actual shelf life is based on safety, quality, and nutrition. The shelf life of most canned and dried foods is approximately 2 years. Food stored longer than 5 years is hoarding not storing.

Do not taste any food which may be unsafe. 1. Food was not processed properly. If improper processing times, methods, and/or recipes were used for home canned vegetables and meats, the jar may be sealed, but the product deadly — DO NOT TASTE — discard. Use only scientifically approved recipes for home canning. 2. Look for the following signs of spoilage — DO NOT TASTE — discard: a. Bulging lid — lid must be definitely concave; seal cannot be lifted with fingers. b. Milky appearance to liquid — as food ages the liquid will become more cloudy and a residue will begin to form in bottom of jar — this is the food sluffing off, but the appearance should not be milky . c. Mold growth of any kind . d. Slimy appearance or texture. e. Rancid odor — especially in foods which contain any amount of fat, like dehydrated protein. f. Corrosion on inside of can, especially along seam (particular problem with canned foods older than 10 years or more. g. Rust — especially on seam or seal of can. h. Frozen can or bottle — freezing produces hairline fractures in seal and allows spoilage to begin. I. Off-smell — food generally changes in odor as it ages, if the smell has developed to the point it is undesirable, discard. j. Food stored in non-food grade container — the container was not meant for food or once contained a non-food product (garbage bags, garbage cans, cleaning bottles or buckets, kitty liter, etc.). Discarding Old Food If safety is not in question but quality and nutrition are undesirable, discard by placing in compost pit, spread over garden, feed to livestock, or discard in the landfill. If the quality is such that you will not to eat it — do not give to food banks, it will not be any more acceptable to them. But, if the food is desirable to eat and safe, food banks are always in need of donated food. If food safety is questionable, discard in a closed container then inside trash container. Do not feed to pets. Using “ Acceptable ” Older Food The longer food is stored the more the flavor, texture, color, and odor will change. If the food is safe (use the check list above), then the following may be used to create tasty dishes. Coverup strong flavor with spices, herbs, or other flavorings (cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, Italian seasoning, creole seasoning, etc. — the stronger the flavoring the greater the coverup). Hide softening texture by pureeing, or mixing with other foods. Color will not be as noticeable if added to other foods."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":" Food Storage Cooking School — Low and Hendricks, USU Extension, Salt Lake County, 1/99.

Caution, it is rich, and so should not be used as a frequent means of using stored fruit. If old fruit is not available, canned fruit of any age, or fruit cocktail, works well. Cake texture is more like a pudding cake, rather than a light and fluffy cake. There are many versions of the standard recipe. Try adapting your own to suit your needs and nutrition. Serves 16-20 1 quart fruit, with juice 1 ½ cups sugar 1 cup oil 4 cups flour 4 teaspoons baking soda 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon cloves 1 teaspoon nutmeg 1 tablespoon cinnamon 1 cup raisins, nuts or coconut (optional) Blend fruit with juice in food processor or blender (or use a potato masher — it need not be a fine puree). Add sugar and oil to fruit and mix well. Add remaining ingredients and mix. Pour batter in a non-stick 9x13 baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour. Cake is rich and can be eaten plain, but if frosting is desired, a butter cream or cream cheese frosting is nice.

Makes about 3-4 servings. 2 cups bottled fruit, drained 1 cup yogurt 1 banana (optional) Combine all ingredients in blender and blend until smooth. The banana will help thicken the smoothie. Pureed Fat Replacement Older fruit may be pureed and used in place of part of the fat in baked goods. The fruit will help provide moisture to the recipe, but since pureed fruit does not melt, it will not act the same way as fat in baking, and the final product will be changed. Do not replace all fat with pureed fruit. Begin by replacing ¼ to ½ and test the quality of the product. A good rule of thumb is to maintain at least 1 tablespoon of fat per cup of flour used in the recipe. The rest of the original fat in the recipe may be substituted with fruit. Since fruit is sweet and moist the final baking time may need to be increased to compensate for extra moisture. Fruit Leather A favorite way to use old fruit is in fruit leather. The same principle applies whether the fruit is new or old. Drain juice from fruit (reserve to use later, if needed). Puree fruit, adding additional juice back to the fruit, as needed, to create the consistency of thick applesauce. Add sweetening to taste (frequently the syrup on the fruit is sufficient sweetening). Spices may also be added for additional flavor. Be careful with sweetening and spices, they both concentrate when dried.

What one may find unacceptable, another may notice no difference. Following are ways to help participants understand the difference between taste preferences, biased mind sets, and see the effect of them. 1. Prepare a loaf of bread using 20+ year old wheat and fresh ground wheat. Be careful to keep all other variables identical. The only difference between the two loaves should be the age of the wheat flour. The older wheat will produce a more compact loaf of bread. Slice the loaf and allow participants to describe the bread. 2. Conduct a taste test of stored dried milk. Sometimes dried milk carries with it the stigma of being less than desirable. Taste preference may be based on a mental bias or on the age of the milk rather than the milk. Also some brands of dry milk are more acceptable in taste to some individuals than are others. Prepare the following samples: fresh nonfat dry milk week old fluid skim milk 5+ year old nonfat dry milk ½ whole milk, ½ non-fat dry milk Alternative brand of non-fat dry milk, if desired Place samples in unidentified pitchers and label A, B, C, D, etc. Do not place sample letters in the same order as the answer sheet. Keep a hidden record of which sample belongs with each letter. Pour a sample of each milk and allow participants to taste. Participants identify, by taste, which sample is which type of milk and record their answers on the handout form. After all have had the opportunity to sample the milk, tell participants which samples were which. Discuss answers with participants. Why didn ’ t they identify the same thing? Some will accept the older milk, some will not — but will accept the fresh dry milk. Some may not be able to distinguish between the fresh dry milk and the older fluid milk. 3. Provide samples of old stored foods and fresh foods to show color and odor changes. 4. Prepare a sample of cooked dry beans using fresh dry beans and beans which have been stored for longer than 5 years, preferably 10 years. The older the beans the harder the texture."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":" Food Storage Cooking School — Low and Hendricks, USU Extension, Salt Lake County, 1/99.

Rotating and Keeping an Inventory Teaching Notes Keeping an inventory of food stored will help ensure that food is used in a timely manner and help assess storage needs for individual households. It will also help remind you of where the food has been stored. 1. Update inventory on a regular basis—every 6 months, every year, etc. Set a time that is easily remembered as a reference point and a personal reminder it is time to update (such as your birthday, anniversary, New Years, etc.). This date should have significance to you so it will be remembered. 2. The type of inventory used is not so important as the fact that you have an inventory and keep it updated. Every household is different—different storage needs and locations. An inventory should be as personalized as the household is individualistic. 3. Keep inventory flexible to accommodate change in needs, taste, lifestyle, etc. 4. Keep it simple—the simpler the method the more likely it will be used. 5. Keep is accessible. Place it where it is most likely to be seen and used, for example: use a clip board hung near the storage area, tape inventory on the storage area (i.e., freezer), keep inventory thumb-tacked to a family bulletin board, keep inventory in a notebook next to pantry, other ideas. 6. Keep a master inventory of all storage areas in your home (freezer, fruit room, under the bed, top of closet, etc.). This master inventory need not be more than just a list of where food is stored. 7. Label and date all storage. Practice FIFO (First In First Out). Place newer items behind older items so when an item is taken from the shelf the oldest is reached for first. 8. The following are possible ideas for keeping an inventory and rotation. They may be used separately or combined with another method to make it more efficient for you. A. Tally marks. Make a list of the foods in storage. For each unit stored (pound, quart, bag, etc.) make a single tally mark to the side of the food. Each time a unit is taken from storage make a cross through the tally mark. Every time more food is added to the storage add additional tally marks. This method is a quick visual way of seeing how much is on hand and how much has been used."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":" Food Storage Cooking School — Low and Hendricks, USU Extension, Salt Lake County, 1/99. Copies may be made for individual and non-profit use. 9-2 B. Running Totals For this method make a list of foods in the storage area — freezer, canned, etc. (see handout “Inventory Sheets” ). The handout may be duplicated as needed. In the first column indicate how much of the item is needed for a year ’ s supply. In the next column write down how much of the food is currently on hand. In each of the following columns record the date new food was added to the storage and the amount. Place a plus sign next to the amount. Each time food is taken from this storage location write down the amount with a minus sign next to it. Regularly (every month, 6 months, year, etc.) total all the additions and subtractions and compare the current amount on hand with the amount needed. This method will provide a way of tracking how much is being used, age of the product, as well as current amount on hand. C. Grocery List Make a running grocery list and keep it handy. As an item is taken from storage, add it to grocery list. Next time you shop the item is already on the list to remind you to pick up more. D.

Visual presentation of ideas is extremely helpful for participants to envision how they may utilize, create, and properly store the foods they have accumulated. Following is a list of resources available for checkout from the Utah State University Extension Office in Salt Lake County. Call 468-3170 to reserve display. Items for checkout require a deposit which is refunded upon return of items. Slide Sets 1. “Where To Store It,” by Margaret Hopkin and Becky Low, USU Extension. Slides and script describe containers, storage places, and ideas which supplement the handout. 2. “Food Storage Simplified,” by JoAnn Mortensen and Deloy Hendricks, USU Extension. Slides and script describe food storage in straightforward simple terms. Display Set Items to create a display on storage places. It is recommended that the display be set up on two or three 8-foot banquet tables for easy viewing. Display can be self explaining. When picking up display it is helpful to have a 4-door car with a wide back seat and an empty trunk, or a mini van, or a truck for easier transporting. Display includes the following items: 1. Mini stair unit with shelves built behind stair raisers. 2. Mock up of wall studs with shelves built between studs—stands on floor. 3. Storage bucket night stand with table cloth. 4. Mock up book shelves using storage containers for shelf supports. 5. Board and # 10 cans for creating a false floor. 6. Signs for placement on the display explaining storage ideas. 7. Empty cans and bottles to place in the display. 8. Various storage containers—acceptable and unacceptable."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":" Food Storage Cooking School — Low and Hendricks, USU Extension, Salt Lake County, 1/99. Copies may be made for individual and non-profit use. 10-2 Handout “ How and Where ” How and Where To Store It Containers 1. Choose storage containers to fit the space you have available and the frequency with which you use the product stored. For example: If space is limited, large buckets could be replaced with gallon bottles, smaller jars, individual containers. 2. Storage containers are constructed using different chemicals. Some of these chemicals can leach out into food, if food is stored in it. If the containers were intended for food, but other non-food products were stored in them, these chemicals could also leach into the food. For this reason use only food grade, moisture-proof, puncture proof, air-tight containers. 3. Unacceptable containers for storage include garbage cans, garbage bags, cleaning containers, bleach bottles, kitty liter containers, etc. New galvanized garbage cans lined with a food-grade liner (the liner must say it is acceptable for food on the package) is an acceptable way of storing large quantities of grains and other foods. 4. Be cautious when using containers which are food grade, but once held food which had a strong odor or flavor. For example: empty pickle bottles collected from food service establishments (restaurants, schools, etc.) are acceptable storage containers, but they may make the food stored in them smell and taste like pickles. 5. Mylar bags are easy to stack and (if carefully opened) may be resealed. Bags may develop pin hole perforations allowing storage conditions to be sacrificed, and bags are not rodent proof. Pest Control Food storage is meant for people, not pests. In the best interest of the family budget, food conservation, health and well-being, pest infestation needs to be prevented and controlled. Even the cleanest home may at times experience problems. Pests may come into the home on the product or in its packaging. A Begin control measures by purchasing foods from a reputable dealer. B. Store foods in sturdy hard plastic, glass, or metal containers with tight fitting lids and no open seams or crevices. C. Periodically check long term storage for pest infestation."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":" Food Storage Cooking School — Low and Hendricks, USU Extension, Salt Lake County, 1/99. Copies may be made for individual and non-profit use. 10-3 Treatment Methods to Control Pest Infestations 1. Freezing Small quantities of grain, 1 to 10 pounds, can be placed in a medium to heavy food grade plastic bag and placed in a deep freezer for 4 days. This will usually destroy all stages of any insect pests which are present. 2. Heat This method works well for smaller quantities of food. When packaged foods such as beans, cereals, whole grains, nuts, and similar dried foods become infested they may be sterilized by heating in an open oven. Spread a shallow layer (less than ½ inch deep) of product on a cookie sheet or large pan. Place the pan in a pre-heated oven (140 º to 150 º F) for 30 minutes or more. Leave the oven door open to avoid over heating. This treatment should destroy all stages of the insect. Thoroughly cool the product before packing into storage container. If product had insect infestation, use a large fan to blow across the pan and remove any existing insect fragments. Excess heat will destroy the gluten making properties of protein in wheat and reduce the ability of the whole wheat bread to rise properly. Heat will destroy sprouting capabilities. 3. Dry ice To fumigate home stored wheat and other products with dry ice, place about 3 to 4 inches of grain on the bottom of storage container. Place crushed dry ice on wheat and fill container with grain. Leave lid ajar on container for approximately 30 minutes to allow dry ice to vaporize displacing the oxygen. This method will control most adult and larval insects present but may not destroy all eggs. Check grain after 2-3 weeks for additional infestation. Amount of dry ice needed: 14 ounces for 100 pounds grain, or 1 pound dry ice for every 30 gallons of grain. 4. Chewing gum, bay leaves, ten-penny nails If it appears these methods are working, it is only because there was no infestation to begin with. There is no scientific evidence these and other old wives tales prevent insect infestation or control infestations. 5. Pesticides Some pesticides may be harmful when used around food or kitchen equipment. Others become harmful if used improperly or in improper concentrations. Select a pesticide which indicates on the label it is effective with the particular pest problem at hand. Second, select a product for in-door use. Third, follow the package directions on the container precisely. Fourth, never use pesticides on or near food."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":" Food Storage Cooking School — Low and Hendricks, USU Extension, Salt Lake County, 1/99. Copies may be made for individual and non-profit use. 10-4 Rats, Mice, Ants, Cockroaches, Flies Begin by being pro-active. Purchase storage products from reputable dealers. Deny pests food, shelter, and water. In other words, place food in hard plastic, glass, or metal containers. Keep storage area clean. Fix all leaks in taps, hoses, water lines, drains, etc. Dry out all standing water. Pest proof your home by fixing screens, repair or place weather stripping around doors and windows, caulk around water and gas lines entering the home, repair cracks in walls and foundations. Take out the garbage. Store garbage away from the house. Keep garbage area clean. Weevil Weevil are not harmful if eaten. But the food quality deteriorates the longer the food is exposed to the weevil. Food becomes stale, rancid, and “ visually ” undesirable. Inspect food, determine if the food will be thrown out or used. Place food in hard plastic, glass, or metal containers with tight fitting lid and no open seams or crevices — this will contain infestation to that container only. Wash storage area with hot soapy water. Pay special attention to cracks, crevices, etc., where grain and cereals may have fallen. Product may be placed in the freezer to destroy any remaining eggs and larvae. Weevil generally thrive on grain and cereal products, but they have been known to invade spices as well. Indianmeal Moth Moths present a major storage problem. Indianmeal moths are small moths that congregate around storage. They may be brought into the home with pet foods as well as food products. Throughly examine all pet foods and grain type products. If there is any infestation, place the product in closed containers and discard. Treat remaining product with one of the treatment methods listed above. Place product in air-tight containers. Thoroughly clean storage area paying particular attention to cracks, crevices, corners, etc., where food may have spilled. Recheck products and storage area every week for a month to ensure infestation is controlled. Ants Ants will continue to be a problem until the queen is destroyed. If possible (this sometimes requires great patience) follow the ants back to the nest. Simply pouring boiling water down in the nest will destroy the queen and end the problem. Pesticides applied to the nest are also effective. In the meantime keep storage area and kitchen clean — floor, counters, sink, garbage area, etc. Pesticides may be applied around baseboards, home foundation, and all areas where ants may enter the home. Fruit Flies Fruit flies are a particular problem in the fall, but can be present any time. They are attracted to ripening fruit. Throughly check home for any fruit or spilled fruit juice. Discard fruit and thoroughly wash areas where fruit juice may have dripped or spilled."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":" Food Storage Cooking School — Low and Hendricks, USU Extension, Salt Lake County, 1/99.

The ideal situation does not exist in every home (and many times cannot exist). When the ideal is not available — do the best you can . It is better to have some food stored in poor conditions and rotated than no food stored. When space is limited and storage conditions are less than ideal — rotate the food out in shorter periods of time. The ideal storage area is: 1. Cool — 50 º F. Usually a range between 50 º to 70 º F is acceptable. 2. Dry — Humidity between 50-70% 3. Dark 4. Well ventilated — Place items 6 inches off the floor, away from walls, away from heating vents and ducts, pipes, etc. 5. Secure shelves in case of earth quake. Tie or anchor shelves to wall studs, floors, or other shelf units to prevent tipping. Finding Storage Places Not all homes are constructed to be favorable for food storage (or, may not even have the space available to begin with), such as apartments, small homes, condos, trailers, or even large homes built for show. Finding space may be creative, but keep in mind, if the space is not ideal storage conditions, food must be rotated out in shorter periods of time to maintain quality and nutrients. Keep some kind of master inventory of what is stored and where it is stored in order to rotate foods in a timely manner. Following are a few ideas for finding storage space. Begin by searching out the nooks, crannies, insets, gaps, next to ’ s, and spots above/below existing storage. { Place cases of food in tops of closets. { Store food underneath hanging clothes in the bottom of closets. { Store items under stairs. { Place storage in corners of rooms. { Store food under furniture and beds. { Move books forward on bookshelves and place food storage behind the books. { Place less used water storage in hard to reach corner cupboards. Create Space { Organize, and de-junk other storage to allow for food storage. { Move seasonal clothing and replace with storage in clothes closet. { Fill empty fruit jars with water or other storage — it ’ s the same jar space empty or full. { Cut holes in the side of boxed canned food — boxes become the shelves. { Stack storage and use as a support for tables, book shelves, bed frames, etc. { Add shelves to small alcoves or halls. { Rather than a traditional coffee table, use chests and trunks — store food inside. { Reassign space — move kitchen utensils into the open and store food in their place. { Add shelves to back side of doors. { Add shelves to back side of each stair riser."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":" Food Storage Cooking School — Low and Hendricks, USU Extension, Salt Lake County, 1/99. Copies may be made for individual and non-profit use. 10-6 { Build drawers in front side of stair risers. { Move non-food items (toilet paper) to less desirable storage locations like the attic. { False floors in closets. (Arrange storage of equal height in a single layer on the floor, then cover storage with a board and piece of carpet.) Build Space { Rolling can shelves (see plans for building) are convenient, but not necessarily space saving. { Remove wall board on inside of closets or in unfinished basements, build shelves between wall studs. Other Ideas { Keep an inventory of all food and where it is stored. { Stick to a system of removing food from storage and place in daily use pantry areas. { Date all store items. Practice FIFO (First In, First Out). { Make equipment serve dual purposes, example — quilt frames as a jar support on shelves. { Place food needed for one month in a single box, date or number boxes for easy rotation. { Stack buckets on top of each other with board between for support — prevents crushed lids.

It is recommended that life sustaining foods be stored. While no exact formula has been given for what to store—wheat, rice, dry milk, and legumes are often used as a starting point. Frequently, they are stored and too often forgotten. It is an investment to store these food resources, but today our insatiable desire for convenience, speed, and refined taste often push these food items to the back of the storage where they sit and “wait for the disaster” that will force them to be consumed. Unfortunately, even the best storing items do not last forever. The longer they are stored the poorer the quality, the less desirable they are, and the greater the likelihood they will be discarded. The investment and security are lost. This section, including the handouts “Wheat,” “Dry Milk,” “Rice,” and “Beans, ” is intended to provide ideas rather than be a cookbook. For additional recipes visit your local library or bookstore. Practical Use of Stored Items It is more practical to incorporate something new into the familiar (practical application) than to abandon the familiar and switch to the new. Following is a method for incorporating basic life sustaining storage items into the diet. Idea 1: Plan menus. We eat the same main dishes about 80% of the time because of taste, habit, awareness, familiarity, etc. Using a menu helps to remind one of the choices that are available. Knowledge and skill create choice. A menu need not be a rigid plan of what to eat for Monday or Tuesday lunch and what to eat for Wednesday dinner. It can be as simple as creating a list of dishes eaten and liked by the family. Keep the list handy and refer to it when deciding what to fix tonight for supper. Create a master menu: A. List foods eaten during the past week. B. Create (brainstorm) a list of dishes family likes and will eat (part of choice is knowing what the choices are (see overhead “List of Foods” ). C. Break list into categories preferred by family (main dish, lunches, side dishes, etc.). D. Post list on refrigerator for at least 2 weeks—add to list as dishes are remembered. E. Involve family members in creating the list. F. The created list should be at least 10-20 dishes long (length will add variety). G. Evaluate current diet pattern. Is it storable? Is it realistic? Will the family eat it? (Fast food and TV dinners are not ideal long term storage items, and they are more difficult to incorporate basic food items into.)"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" Food Storage Cooking School — Low and Hendricks, USU Extension, Salt Lake County, 1/99. Copies may be made for individual and non-profit use. 11-2 1. Should the items that do not store well be reduced? Does it reflect foods that are liked, but because of time required to prepare the dish it is unlikely to be used? Are the items on the list too expensive? Make the list practical and realistic. 2. Could the poor storing items (fast food and TV dinners) be replaced by a similar dish made from scratch at home? H. Determine the number of dishes needed each week (month) to rotate a specific item out of storage in 3-5 years. For example plan 1/5 of all meals eaten to be from food storage. In other words if master menu has 20 meals listed, four meals or 1/5 of 20 meals should be from basic storage or at least include basic storage items. I. Evaluate the list of foods created in A. Which of the dishes could include addition of basic storage items? For example: Meatloaf could be adapted to include wheat or beans with little or no change in the familiar quality of the dish. Write the addition of the basic item to the side of the dish (see overhead “ Adjusted List of Foods. ” ) By making a list of foods (or menu) and keeping it handy as a reference, and by adding the basic storage items to the list will serve as a reminder for which meals food has been stored, and what storage items may be included in the normal diet. (See individual recipe handouts “ Beans, ” “ Wheat, ” “ Rice, ” “ Dry Milk ” for examples.) 1. Keep the dish familiar to and liked by the family. 2. Make small adjustments to recipes and increase changes as taste preference allows. 3. Avoid creating abnormal dishes. The further from a “ normal ” dish the recipe becomes the more inclined the dish will be rejected and classed as undesirable. 4. Add new dishes and recipes to the master menu which use basic storage. 5. Make a conscious effort to use the master menu and basic storage items. Idea 2: Prepare convenient forms of basic item and store reasonable amounts. For example: J. Home canned dry beans (see “ Bean ” handout) K. Prepare Bulgur (see “ Wheat ” handout) L. Cook and freeze item Idea 3: Place basic storage items in convenient containers and in a convenient location. Put it in sight, make it handy to get and use. M. Avoid large awkward containers in hard to reach places. N. Clearly label and date contents of pantry storage."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":" Food Storage Cooking School — Low and Hendricks, USU Extension, Salt Lake County, 1/99.

If the wheat is to be used as a flour product the investment of a wheat grinder, either electrical or hand, is a valuable piece of equipment. Varieties Red Wheat Varieties Hard red wheat varieties grown in Utah and other states are desirable for home storage and bread making. Some of the spring-planted and fall-planted hard red wheat varieties commonly grown in the Intermountain States are listed below. Spring-planted varieties 1. Bannock 5. Pondera 2. Borah  6. Rick 3. Fremont 7. Vandal 4. McKay 8. WB 936 Fall-planted varieties 1. Bonneville 5. Promontory 2. Garland  6. Ute 3. Hansel 7. Weston 4. Manning Hard White Wheat Varieties Recently some new varieties, considered in a new category known as hard white wheat, have been developed. They are suitable for making bread and some people feel that these grains are more acceptable in whole wheat bread than red wheats. Most hard white wheats are spring planted, but some new varieties of hard white winter wheats are being developed. Golden 86 and Klasic are two varieties of hard white spring wheats that may be commercially available. Make It More Convenient: We are in a society where convenience is the norm. We want everything fast and with little work. Wheat takes a little time to prepare. Making it more convenient will increase the likelihood it will be used. For example:Pre-cook: Cooked wheat will store in refrigerator about 1 week. 1. Bulgur (dried form of cooked wheat): will last several months. Bulgur may"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":" Food Storage Cooking School — Low and Hendricks, USU Extension, Salt Lake County, 1/99. Copies may be made for individual and non-profit use. 11-6 be re-hydrated quicker than cooking wheat in the first place. A recipe for preparing bulgur is on the recipe sheet. 2. Freeze cooked wheat: Place cooked wheat in a thin layer on cookie sheet. Partially freeze, then place in freezer bags and store in freezer. Freezing it in this manner will allow you to remove amount desired for use without thawing the entire container. Make It Accessible Store wheat in smaller usable quantities in or near the pantry. We often use the most accessible items first. Make it accessible. Bring It to Mind Make menus (a list of main dishes family will eat) with notes to the side of the list indicating which dishes may be easily converted to a partial or complete wheat dish. Post the list of dishes in a readily viewed location (on the fridge, cupboard door, etc.). Start Small and Keep on Going Do not try to make changes or conversion to a wheat diet overnight. We eat the foods we do because of habit, taste preferences, and familiarity. Allow time to make changes. Make changes small and gradual. Use with Strong Flavored Foods Wheat is a strong nutty flavored grain. When becoming accustomed to eating wheat use it in strong flavored dishes (which will compliment other flavors rather than compete or overpower mild flavors). Mellow It by Removing the Bran Removing the bran from whole wheat flour will mellow flavor, lighten color, and smooth the texture. Sift the flour and remove the bran remaining in the sifter (save the bran and add to cereal, soups, stews, or products). How to Cook Whole Kernel Wheat Rinse one cup of clean whole kernel wheat, add 2 cups of cool water, and 1 teaspoon salt. Allow wheat to soak overnight or for 12 hours. Place rehydrated wheat in a pan and bring to a boil. It may be necessary to add water. Simmer for about 1 hour until tender. Wheat need not be covered with water since cooking by steam is effective. Water should be mostly absorbed at the end of the cooking time. The plumped, cooked wheat will keep in the refrigerator for about 1 week or frozen for longer periods of time. Do It Set a goal to use more wheat and stick to it. The goal may be as simple as making one meal or dish a month using whole wheat."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":" Food Storage Cooking School — Low and Hendricks, USU Extension, Salt Lake County, 1/99.

Cover wheat with water, 2-3 times the amount of wheat. Steam until water is absorbed and wheat is tender (about 35-40 minutes). 3. Spread cooked wheat, thinly, on cookie sheet and place in 200 º F oven to dry (leave door open). Wheat must be very dry in order to crack easily (2-3 hours). A food dehydrator may be used. 4. Crack wheat in a mill, grinder, or in blender. (This step is optional, but produces a finer kernel.) 5. Store in air tight container on shelf. 6.

They store well, cost little, and provide a punch for the nutrition dollar. While the following is a partial list of legumes and a suggested cooking hint, beans may be interchanged in most recipes. Often names are interchanged. Baby Lima — milk flavored. Serve as a vegetable or in casseroles. Light Red Kidney — Excellent in any recipe calling for cooked beans. Backeye Peas — Dry form of the popular pea. Cook with pork or chicken. Navy — Medium-sized white pea bean. Great for baked beans and soup. Dark Red Kidney — Colorful salad bean mainly sold in canned form. Pink — Great barbecue style or cooked with other spicy seasonings. Turtle or Black Bean — A favorite in southern Mexico and Caribbean. Great with rice. Garbanzo or Chick Peas — Nut-like flavor. Ideal for salads and appetizers. Pinto — Popular in chili, refried beans, and other Mexican dishes. Great Northern — Larger than small white or navy beans. Good for baking. Red — Dark red, pea-shaped. Use in any colored bean recipe. Large Limas — Rich, buttery flavor. Cook with smoked meat or cheese. Small White — Firm texture holds up under long slow baking. Anasazi or Ancient Ones — Cooks in about half the time, sweeter flavor, mealier, less gas. Bean Nutrition A serving of beans and legumes is considered to be 1 cup cooked. Legumes are considered high in fiber, low in fat, good source of protein, carbohydrates, folate, and many trace minerals. They are also low cost, thus providing good nutrition for reasonable money, and store well. Protein Complements Animal protein contains all the essential amino acids and can stand alone as a protein choice. Due to the lack of one or more amino acids in plant proteins they need to be paired with either an animal protein or another plant protein to improve their quality. For example: Legumes or dry beans by be paired with seeds and nuts or with a grain (wheat, cornmeal, rice, oats, etc.) This is called protein compliments or protein pairs. Food Safety Dry legumes must be cooked completely before eating. For this reason it is not recommended you grind dry beans and then simply mix with hot water to make instant refried beans. Gas Gas is an undesirable side effect of eating legumes. The body lacks enzymes to digest some sugars in the beans. Since the sugars are not digested, they ferment in the digestive tract creating"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":" Food Storage Cooking School — Low and Hendricks, USU Extension, Salt Lake County, 1/99. Copies may be made for individual and non-profit use. 11-11 gas. Following are a few ways to help alleviate undesirable gas: 1. Soak beans a minium of 3 hours (8-12 hours better); discard soaking water. 2 Sprout beans — soak beans 2-3 days, changing water 3-4 times, until beans begin to sprout. 3. Add the lacking enzyme to the diet in the form of tablets or liquid; one commercial product is called “ Beano. ” Soaking Beans 1. Cover with twice as much water as beans and soak 8-18 hours in cool place, discard soaking water. 2. Quick soak by covering with twice as much water as beans, bring to a boil, boil 2 minutes, remove from heat and allow to soak 1 hour. Discard soaking liquid. 3. Do not salt soaking liquid — it will toughen the bean. 4. It is not necessary to soak split peas and lentils. Cooking Legumes Beans will increase double to triple during soaking and cooking. In other words 1 cup dry beans will produce 2-3 cups cooked. The slower the beans are cooked the easier they are to digest. If adding water to cooking beans is necessary, bring water to a boil before adding. Adding cold water to boiling beans will toughen beans and slow down cooking process. Softening Old Beans The older the bean the tougher it is and less digestible. Following are a few tips to soften old beans. 1. Cook and freeze. The freezing moisture in the bean helps to rupture the cell wall and create a more palatable product. 2. Pressure cook. Follow manufacture ’ s directions for using pressure pan. Increase cooking time as needed to produce a desired texture. 3. Pressure “ can ” beans. This method makes a readily usable product as well as softening beans. Follow USDA canning instructions for pressuring. Increasing Consumption of Beans * Plan menus. * Puree cooked beans and add to baked goods (bread, cake cookies, etc.). * Prepare convenience foods such as home canned dry beans or cook and freeze for later use. * Add whole or mashed beans to meatloafs, soups, stews, casseroles (in small amounts to begin with, then increase as desired, and as allowed by family taste preference)."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":" Food Storage Cooking School — Low and Hendricks, USU Extension, Salt Lake County, 1/99. Copies may be made for individual and non-profit use. 11-12 Home Canned Dry Beans or Peas USDA Complete Guide to Home Canning, Bulletin # 539, printed 1994 Use any variety of mature dry beans. Approximately 1 - 1 ¼ cups (dry measure) will be needed per quart. (Or, 5 pounds will produce 7 quarts jars, 3 ¼ pounds will be needed for 9 pint jars.) 1. Wash and sort beans. 2. Hydrate by (1) Placing beans in a large pan and cover with water. Soak 12-18 hours in a cool place. Drain water; or (2) To quickly hydrate beans, you may cover sorted and washed beans with boiling water in a saucepan. Boil 2 minutes, remove from heat, soak 1 hour and drain. 3. Cover beans soaked by either method with fresh water and boil 30 minutes. Add ½ teaspoon of salt per pint or 1 teaspoon per quart to the jar, if desired. Fill jars with beans and cooking liquid, leaving 1 inch head space. 4. Adjust lids and bands and process in pressure canner 90 minutes for quarts or 75 minutes for pints at: 13 pounds pressure for 4,000-6,000 feet elevations, 14 pounds pressure for 6,000-8,000 feet elevations (if pressure canner has a weight only, process at 15 pounds pressure). It is suggested any home pressure canned foods be boiled 10 minutes before tasting. Beans as a Fat Substitute Dry cooked beans may be pureed and used in place of part of the fat in baked goods. Beans will help provide moisture to the recipe, but since pureed beans will not act the same way as fat in baking, the final product will be changed. Do not replace all fat with pureed beans. Begin by replacing ¼ to ½ and test the quality of the product."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":" Food Storage Cooking School — Low and Hendricks, USU Extension, Salt Lake County, 1/99.

It is a good source of energy, and can supply vitamins and minerals to the diet. It is generally classified as a grain, but in family meals it can be used as: 1. A cereal 2. A vegetable A. As a substitute for potatoes B. As a base for meat C. In soups 3. A dessert D. Puddings E. Custards Rice has been commonly known and used since ancient times. It has been and still is a medium of exchange in some countries. The custom of throwing rice at weddings is a survival of the ancient Chinese religious belief that rice is the symbol of fertility. It is easy to store, takes little storage space, and has no waste since it is completely edible. Rice has been grown in America since 1668, and technological developments have kept pace to provide the kind of rice needed for any purpose. Even though there are 7,000 varieties of rice produced in the world, the consumer needs to be aware that generally there are only three different lengths of rice grain and five different kinds. Lengths Long grain rice is distinguished because its length is four to five times its width. The grains are clear and translucent. The grains remain distinct and separate after cooking. Medium grain rice is about three times as long as its width. This type is less expensive than long grain rice. This is because it requires a shorter growing season and produces a higher yield per acre. It is also easier to mill than the long grained variety. Short grain rice is only one and a half to two times as long as it is wide. It is generally the least expensive of the three lengths. Kinds With five different kinds of rice to select from, it is important to be able to distinguish between the different varieties available."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":" Food Storage Cooking School — Low and Hendricks, USU Extension, Salt Lake County, 1/99. Copies may be made for individual and non-profit use. 11-17 Brown rice is the whole, unpolished grain of rice with only the outer fibrous, inedible hull removed. Brown rice requires more water and longer cooking time than white rice. It has a delightful, chewy texture, with a distinctive nut-like flavor. Brown rice shelf life is very short. It is not a good item for long term storage. Regular milled white rice is rice from which hulls, germ, outer bran layers and most of the inner bran are removed in the milling process. The grains are bland in flavor and are fluffy and distinct when cooking directions are followed. Parboiled rice — sometimes called processed or converted rice — has been treated to keep some of the natural vitamins and minerals the whole grain contains. It has been cooked before milling by a special steam pressure process. It requires longer cooking time than regular milled white rice, but after cooking the grains are fluffy, separate and plump. Pre-cooked or instant rice — quick type — is completely cooked. It needs only to stand in boiling water to be ready for serving. Cooking this product will result in a gummy, indistinguishable mass. Fortified or Enriched rice — This product is a combination of highly fortified rice with ordinary milled rice. A coating of vitamins and minerals — thiamine, niacin, iron, and sometimes riboflavin — is used to fortify rice. This coating adheres to the rice and does not dissolve with ordinary washing or cooking. Wild rice — Wild rice is not rice at all, but the seed of a wild water grass found around the Great Lakes region. It is much more expensive than the types of rice described above. Many Americans have discovered this rice and developed a taste for it. The demand for it is almost greater than the supply. Preparation Some rules are a must in preparing rice. Due to the fact that the B vitamins are added to rice in the form of powder, much of the valuable nutrients are lost if the product is not handled properly. A. Do not wash rice before cooking or rinse it after cooking. Rice is one of the most sanitary foods. Rice grown and milled in the U.S. is clean. Nutrients on the surface of the rice are washed away if it is washed or rinsed before cooking. B. Do not use too much water when cooking rice. Any water drained off means wasted food value. Too much water makes soggy rice. Too little water results in a dry product. C. Do not stir rice after it comes to a boil. This breaks up the grains and makes the rice gummy. D. Do not leave rice in a pan in which it is cooked for more than 5-10 minutes or the cooked rice will pack."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":" Food Storage Cooking School — Low and Hendricks, USU Extension, Salt Lake County, 1/99.

Seafood in brine naturally fermented and acted as a natural preservative. Later on cooked rice was added to improve fermentation. Today sushi means vinegared rice which is garnished with or without raw fish or seafood. This easy version uses prepared vegetables, and is served in a pocket of seasoned fried bean curd called inarizushi-no-moto. It is garnished with fried eggs and pickled ginger root (if desired). 1 ½ cups short grain rice, uncooked ¼ cup rice vinegar, seasoned (or see below) 1 10 oz. can inarizushi-no-moto, or aburage (seasoned fried bean curd or tofu) ½ 7 ¾ oz. can chirashisushi-no-moto, (quick sushi vegetable mix) frozen peas, or chopped parsley for color 2 eggs 1 teaspoon cornstarch pickled ginger (optional) Cook rice according to package directions. While still warm place rice in large bowl and sprinkle with seasoned vinegar. Gently mix rice and vinegar using a cutting fluffing motion. Add more or less vinegar to rice according to taste. Stir in quick sushi vegetable mix and enough thawed frozen peas for color. Gently open sides of aburage and stuff filling into each pocket. Be careful not to overstuff and tear aburage pockets. Make thin sheets of fried eggs by beating together eggs, cornstarch and 1 teaspoon water. Lightly oil a non-stick pan, heat. Pour in enough egg to just coat bottom of pan. Rotate skillet to coat. Cook until edges begin to curl up and surface becomes glossy. Slide egg sheets onto waxed paper or plastic wrap. Cut egg sheets into thin strips. Garnish sushi with strips of eggs and thin strips of pickled ginger. TO MAKE SEASONED VINEGAR: Combine ½ cup rice vinegar, ½ cup sugar, and 1 teaspoon salt. Heat slightly and stir until sugar and salt are dissolved.

It is one of the richest sources of absorbable calcium. It is also high in protein, potassium, riboflavin, and vitamins A, D, and B12 — all essential to optimal health. Research has found a diet rich in milk (low-fat) helps reduce high blood pressure, helps prevent osteoporosis (and reduce the consequences of this bone disease), and may help prevent colon cancer and suppress development of malignant tumors. When dried, milk is a convenient and vital addition to the home food storage program. This information has been compiled to assist you in storing and rotating dry milk in home storage in order to maintain the optimum quality and usability of your investment. Regular or Instant Regular or instant dry milk is made from skim milk that has been dried by spraying into hot air. Instant milk is regular milk which has been further processed causing it to clump together resulting in a product easier to reconstitute with water. They both have the same nutrients. Regular, or non-instant, is more compact and requires less storage space. Dried whole milk is available, but because of the higher fat content the shelf life is much lower. Purchasing Considerations 1. Buy milk which has been fortified with Vitamin A and D. 2. “ No Preservatives ” on the label are reassuring to consumers; however, preservatives are not legal and therefore no dried milk processed in the United States will contain preservatives. 3. Grade A indicates the quality of the milk used in the drying process. Essentially all processing plants producing dried milk use Grade A milk today. 4. “ Extra Grade ” on the label indicates the processing plant has met certain criteria and milk is slightly lower in butterfat and moisture content, more soluble, contains fewer bacteria, and contains fewer scorched particles. 5. The package should be waterproof and impermeable to air. Plastic films are good protection for short periods of time. 6. Do not buy more milk than you would normally use in a reasonable period of time. Once the package is opened the milk will not keep as long. Purchase package sizes to accommodate the use required by your family. 7. Date and label the milk. Rotate milk. (See storage below.)"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":" Food Storage Cooking School — Low and Hendricks, USU Extension, Salt Lake County, 1/99. Copies may be made for individual and non-profit use. 11-21 Storage Shelf life of milk is based on the quality of the product. Undesirable chemical changes occur in milk the longer it is stored affecting the flavor, odor, and color. Care should be taken to insure the best possible storage conditions for dry milk. The following factors should be considered. 1. Temperature — The temperature at which milk is stored is the most important factor in determining its shelf life. The storage temperature should be as cool as possible. Deterioration of dry milk will be considerably slowed down by a reduction of the storage temperature. As a general guide, the following storage times and temperatures are given. Following is a guide to shelf life for milk stored at different temperatures (in unopened packages) with either nitrogen or carbon dioxide used to replace the air in the package. Storage times will be shorter in paper or in cardboard packages. 50 º F - 24 to 48 months 70 º F - 12 to 24 months 90 º F - 3 months 2. Moisture — Exclude as much moisture as possible by packaging in vapor-proof materials and storing in a dry area of the home, away from steam or areas where condensation could occur. Moisture causes caking and speeds up the undesirable changes in flavor. 3. Oxygen — Exclude the oxygen as much as possible to decrease the speed of chemical changes which cause flavor and odor changes. This can be accomplished by packaging in air-tight packaging materials, vacuum packing, and packing with nitrogen or carbon dioxide. 4. Light — Exclude as much light as possible. The chemical changes which cause changes in flavor and odor are accelerated by light. Amount Needed Assuming dry milk is consumed as a beverage as well as in cooking, the amounts needed for one year would be: Fresh milk adults (2 glasses per day): 45 gallons youth (4 glasses per day): 91 gallons Dry milk adults (2 glasses per day): 36 pounds youth (4 glasses per day): 73 pounds"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":" Food Storage Cooking School — Low and Hendricks, USU Extension, Salt Lake County, 1/99.

Building a Storage Program Teaching Notes Use handout “Building Program.” Food storage is good, in that it provides a personal buffer against outside forces (economic, natural, political, etc.). But, it must also be placed in proper perspective. It is a resource and a resource should be wisely managed. Like any other resource it should be kept in balance with other resources. It has never been a wise practice to “rob Peter to pay Paul” or to deplete one resource at the sacrifice of another. When effort is steady and consistent it engenders knowledge and familiarity of the topic thus integrating it into one’s life. For this reason it is not wise to spend a concentrated effort of time and money on food storage in order to simply check it off one’s list of things to do. The more time and effort spent on the project the more the project will become a part of everyday life, practical and useable. 1. Avoid going into debt. This is “robbing Peter to pay Paul” and may create a situation much more serious than not having “food stored for a time of emergency.” 2. Budget all expenses for the household and include a food storage budget. 3. Change the mind set from food storage only in time of disaster to food providently used daily. If the food is not to be eaten immediately, it is food storage. Purchase food to increase the amount stored. Purchase food to manage one’s own storage program. Purchase food in accordance with personal and family tastes, habits, lifestyle, age, etc. 4. Allot an amount each shopping trip to increase storage amount (since food storage is being rotated and used daily—that means 80% of the food dollar should be going for food storage); therefore, use wise shopping strategies on every shopping trip. A. Shop with a plan and with a list—use the list of foods generated in the “How to Store What You Use” section. B. Compare prices: 1. Compare the price of one brand to another. Try out new brands before purchasing in quantity to ensure the quality is acceptable to your household and will be eaten. 2. Compare the price of one size package to another. Divide the size of the package into the price and compare the price per unit of different packages. A. Shop sales—Be cautious of shopping several stores and risking impulse buying at each store. Sometimes the 50 cents saved may cost $5.00 more in the long run 1. Compare price of sale item to non-sale item—is it really less expensive? 2. Do not be persuaded to purchase an item just because it is on sale. 3. Be cautious using coupons, they are used to encourage sales for the store or the manufacturer."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":" Food Storage Cooking School—Low and Hendricks, USU Extension, Salt Lake County, 1/99. Copies may be made for individual and non-profit use. 12-2 D. Buy foods in season. E. Buy two items when one is needed. 4. Shop in quantity or bulk—but with wisdom: A. Be sure quantity will be used before spoilage occurs or quality deteriorates. B. Be sure quality of bulk item is high quality. Food will never be any higher in quality than the day you purchase it. C. Use wisdom when purchasing at bargain stores, discount stores, salvage stores, warehouses, etc. Items sold at these stores may be lower priced due to poor quality and safety. If the food is discarded later or causes illness, the bargain price will not be worth the cost. (Even after following the guidelines below the quality of the product inside the package may not be acceptable.) 1. Check expiration dates—old items do not store well. 2. Check quality of packaging for tears, openings, exposed product, signs of leaking, soiling, excessive dirt, etc. 3. Check for signs of pest infestation. 4. Check for signs of temperature abuse—frozen packages are distorted, warped or have large ice crystals; items which should be loose are frozen into a solid clump; frost build up; freezer burn, etc. D. Reject cans with dents on the seams, dents on the seal, dents large enough to hold at least one finger, cans with bulging lids, signs of leaking, rust, etc. 6. Ways to “increase” available money for food storage: A. Use non-fixed income for storage such as tax refunds, gifts of money, bonus checks, rebate checks, etc. B. Use entertainment money for storage by cutting back on (or cutting out) movies and movie rentals for 1 month, 2 months, etc. C. Eat at home rather than eating out; cut back on snacks; use money spent on snacks such as sodas, chips, candy, munchies; develop cooking skills and cook from scratch rather than with higher priced convenience foods; pack a lunch rather than eat out. D. Use vacation money by: choosing a less expensive vacation; shorten vacation time and use money saved for storage items; stay home for vacation; plan vacation wisely— lack of planning usually ends up in higher costs and less results. 7. Purchase foods from a reputable source. The handout gives a few sources for individuals to purchase food and equipment needed to build their own home storage program. It is not complete, nor was it intended to be complete and all encompassing, rather it is intended to be used as a springboard of ideas for individuals to consider. Create your own local list of resources and suggestions."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":" Food Storage Cooking School—Low and Hendricks, USU Extension, Salt Lake County, 1/99. Copies may be made for individual and non-profit use. 12-3 Handout “Building Storage Program” Building Storage Program Methods The following ideas are to help in building up food storage: 1. Create menus, then use them. 2. Shop with a grocery list— match grocery list to food storage menus. 3. Know how much of what is needed for personal storage program—inventory storage and purchase items to complement current storage, personal tastes, and family preferences. 4. Build storage slowly. Rather than spending a great amount of money to purchase all storage at one time, it is more practical to build food storage at a slow and steady rate. Gradually adding to food storage will ensure a variety of shelf life dates and higher quality food over a longer period of time. Slowly adding storage will also allow time to adjust to food storage principles of storing what is used and using what is stored. Storing slowly and continually will allow time to practice using what is stored and developing skills. 5. Change mind set. Since food storage is any food stored for later use, that means all food purchased is food storage. The key is to increase the amount of food stored for later use. 6. Allot an amount of money each shopping trip to increase storage. 7. Buy two of an item, even though only one of the items is needed presently. Bargain Buys Use wisdom in bargain stores, discount stores, warehouses: 1. Check product date—old or poor quality food is no bargain. 2. Watch for safety—the following signs indicate poor choice. a. Dented cans—reject if: 1. Dents on seams 2. Dents on seal 3. Dents large enough to hold at least one finger 4. Sharp edges on dents 5. Bulging lids 6. Signs of leaking b. Expired or close to expired dates. c. Poor or compromised packaging: 1. Package torn, open, or contents otherwise exposed. 2. Distorted package or it appears to have been wet at some time. 3. Package shows signs of pest infestation. 4. Excessive dirt on package. 3. Purchase long term storage items from reputable dealer."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":" Food Storage Cooking School—Low and Hendricks, USU Extension, Salt Lake County, 1/99.

Priorities should be used in budgeting financial needs with food storage purchases. The following are a few ideas to increase money available for purchasing food storage. 1. Shop sales—be cautious of damaged, poor quality, or outdated goods which may be on sale—shop for quality. 2. Buy foods in season when prices are lower. 3. Buy in bulk— price compare to ensure bulk price is really cheaper, also be sure bulk will be used before shelf life expires. 4. Use tax refund, bonuses, rebate checks, gift money, and other money not a part of fixed income. 5. Forego spending money on entertainment one time and use money saved on storage (exchange entertainment—for example, rent a movie rather than purchase a movie ticket and use the difference on food storage, or watch TV instead). 6. Choose less expensive vacation, shorten vacation, or stay home for vacation and use money saved on storage. 7. Use brown bag for lunch, stay home rather than eating out, cut out commercial snacks, cook from scratch, etc., and used money saved on storage (plus it uses the items stored and develops skills for using storage). 8. Your ideas. Resources The following list is not meant to condone or promote any commercial establishment, but rather to give participants a springboard in finding food storage. Stores specialize in different items, some are a do-it-yourself rather than a retail outlet. Call store for details. NOTE: This is not a complete list of possible stores nor is it all encompassing.
