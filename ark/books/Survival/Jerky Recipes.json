[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"To SAVE this recipe collection to your computer all you have to do is just \"copy and paste\" the contents of this email into a document from whichever word processor you have on your computer (WordPad, MS Word, etc...) and then save that document. This is a good idea for you to do anyways, just in case this email gets deleted... then you'll still have the recipes saved on your computer. (NOTE TO AOL & COMPUSERVE USERS: You don't have to do this, as the collection should already be saved on your computer when you downloaded it.) Once you have the recipes saved to your computer, it is very easy to only print out one or two of them at a time. All you need to do is open up your saved recipe collection and \"highlight\" the recipe you'd like to print... then \"copy and paste\" that recipe into another document and print that out. To print another recipe on the same page, just repeat the above process (highlight, copy, paste) before printing. Here's a good tip if you decide to print out the WHOLE recipe collection: It's extra nice if you can print the recipe collection out on the paper that already has 3 holes punched in it (you can find this paper at any Staples or Office Depot). If you use this paper then you can put the whole recipe collection into a 3-ring binder or folder and it's almost like having a cookbook!! This \"cookbook\" would make a great gift for someone who owns a food dehydrator... or if you decide to give someone a food dehydrator as a gift, this would be a great little \"bonus\" to give along with it!! Thank you & HAVE FUN!! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PLEASE NOTE: The following is a February 1997 Statement from the USDA's Meat and Poultry Hotline (1-800-535-4555) regarding the safe making of jerky. Many of the following recipes do not follow these USDA guidelines exactly, but I wanted to include this statement from them so you would be aware of it. I've made jerky in a food dehydrator many times without cooking it first and have never had a problem, and have also used a lower oven temperature than they recommend, but if you'd like to be SURE that you're safe from microorganisms or bacteria, you may want to adust any of these recipes as needed to fit their guidelines, which they say will prevent any bacteria or microorganisms from forming or lingering. Here is their statement: \"Jerky can be made in a dehydrator, but the meat must be cooked first by BAKING IN AN OVEN OR SIMMERING IN A MARINADE before being placed in the dehydrator. Just using the dehydrator will inactivate microorganisms but not kill them. The right conditions of heat and moisture may cause the microorganisms to become active without the consumer even being aware of a potentially dangerous situation.\" Baking In An Oven First: Place the jerky on cake racks placed on baking sheets and bake in a 325 F oven. Check the internal temperature using a meat thermometer (stack the jerky and then insert the thermometer in the center). An internal temperature of 160 F must be reached for beef products, fish and game meats. An internal temperature of 180 F must be reached for poultry products. Once this temperature is reached, you may proceed with the manufacturer's directions for drying jerky in a dehydrator (adjustments in the listed length of time to dry will be required), or you may finish drying in the oven using the following guidelines........ The temperature of the oven should be 170 F or higher and the door needs to be propped open 2 to 6 inches. Circulation can be improved by placing a fan outside the oven near the door. CAUTION: This is not a safe practice for a home with small children!! Dry the jerky until a test piece cracks but does not break when"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"it is bent (5 to 6 hours). Pat off any beads of oil with absorbent toweling and cool. Remove strips from the racks. Cool. Package and store in a cool, dry place. Simmering In A Marinade First: The meat is marinated for both flavor and tenderness. Ingredients for marinades include oil, salt and an acid product such as vinegar, lemon juice, teriyaki, soy sauce or wine. Follow the directions for the marinade of your choosing. After the meat has marinated for 1-2 hours or overnight, place the meat and marinade in a saucepan and simmer until the internal temperature of 160 F for beef, fish and game meats or 180 F for poultry is reached using a meat thermometer (use the liquid to measure the temperature). Drain. Continue by drying the jerky either in a dehydrator or using the oven. Okay, now that the legal \"mumble jumble\" is outta the way...........

Lay the chicken breasts on a hard surface, cover with waxed parchment paper, and gently pound the breasts until they are about 1/4 inch thick.

Cut across grain for tender and lengthwise for chewy. The more consistent you are when cutting the strips the better your jerky will dry evenly. Mix all ingredients in blender except meat and Cayenne. Soak strips of meat in the above mixture and refrigerate for 24-48 hours in a closed container (I use a Tuppleware bread box). Shake several times to mix well. Pat dry. Place directly on oven racks that have been covered with tin foil and sprayed with Pam. Cook in preheated oven @ 160 F for 2-3 hours (with door closed). This kills bacteria, removes a lot of the excess moisture and melts any excess fat. Return hot strips to mixture and refrigerate for another 6-12 hours (remember to shake several times). Pat dry and sprinkle with Cayenne powder. Spread in dehydrator. Set dehydrator at 145 F. The final drying usually takes about another 6-10 hours. Do not over dry (Check every few hours). Jerky should be tuff and leathery, not brittle or hard. A real mouth watering HOT treat! Enjoy. If you don't have a dehydrator return Jerky to 150 F oven for 6-12 hours leaving door open a little. An alternate for the final drying would be to use a low heat smoker. Leave out the Liquid Smoke in the Marinade. Notes: Venison has always cooked faster for me than beef (less moisture?). So check it more frequently. Yields about 1.75 - 2 lbs. dried jerky. I make this nice and hot for a reason.

In a bowl combine soy sauce, Worcestershire, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and smoke-flavored salt. Stir until seasonings are dissolved. Add all the the meat strips and work them thoroughly into the mixture until all surfaces are well coated. The meat will absorb most, if not all, the liquid. Cover tightly and let stand overnight in the refrigerator. Or you can let stand one hour and proceed. Shake off any excess liquid, arrange strips of meat close together, but no overlapping, directly on oven racks or cake racks set in shallow, rimmed pans. Dry meat in oven at the lowest possible setting 150 degrees to 200 degrees (F). Flip every hour or two - until it feels hard and is dry to the touch - 5 hours for chicken & turkey, 4 to 7 hours for beef and vension. Pat off any beads of oil. Cool and store in airtight plastic bags or in jars with tight fitting lids. Keeps in refrigerator or at room temperature indefinitely. NOTE: This is good with garlic too. If you have one of those herb mortar and pestle things of glass, metal or ceramic, mash up a finely diced garlic clove with the pepper, onion powder and hickory-smoked salt until it is a greyish mess.

Cut the individual muscles out of the meat and cut off and discard all the fat and connecting tissue. Cut the meat across the grain as thin as possible, 1/16 to 1/8th of an inch. The thinner the slices, the easier it will be to dry. Salt and pepper the meat generously on both sides, using more pepper than salt. Lay out the meat strips on a cake or oven rack without overlapping them. Set the rack in an insert fireplace and cook on low heat for 8 to 10 hours, turning every 3 to 4 hours, until dried. You can do the same with a dehydrator or oven, but it wont turn out as good. After it's done, store in a pillowcase.

SMOKEHOUSE JERKY Meat: venison top round steak turkey breast Brine: Kiln dried medium malt molasses (Brer Rabbit light or Grandma's) black and/or red pepper The Meat: Generally, the lean scraps from most venison (elk, deer, caribou, antelope and moose) work very good. Bear is greasy (sorry Bear), as is pork. Buffalo is similar to beef and makes good jerky. The best cut of beef that will yield the most usable lean meat is the top round. If you like turkey, use large bone in breasts and remove the bone. I haven't done reptiles, but what the hey, if that's your bag give it a shot. The meat should be reasonably aged, at least kept cool for a week or so after it's dressed out and skinned. It is important to trim as much fat off as possible, even if you have to cut it out or scrape it off. The fat will not take salt very well when the meat brines, it will become rancid and grow mold quickly. Cut the meat with the grain, into strips as big around as your thumb (3/4-1\" square) and as long as possible. The Brine: This is a self brining method and works in two stages, dehydration and rehydration. The ingredients needed are: A kiln dried medium salt. Most feed stores have 50# bags for about $3.00 which will make about eight thousand pounds of jerky. Medium salt is about the size of salt that comes on a pretzel. Molasses. I use Brer Rabbit light or Grandma's. Brer Rabbit comes in pint bottles and have a small top that you can pour a nice 'string' from. Grandma's comes in a large mouth bottle and it's best if you"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"transfer it to some sort of a squeeze top ketchup or pancake syrup bottle (1 pint = about 20# of meat). Black Pepper, medium grind or coarse - your choice. If you like it hot, use red pepper flakes instead, if you don't like pepper leave it out. This brine process goes easier and more quickly if you have a few extra happy hands joining in - the kids, the wife and myself usually make it a project and when it's done everyone gets to pat each other on the back. Since we're all together and helping each other, some interesting conversations usually surface. Anyway, you will need a flat bottom non-corrosive container and lid, a Tupperware storage bin, a plastic bus tray or a stainless steam table pan will work well. The size depends on the amount of meat and the room in your refer - the lids keep things out and are handy for stacking the containers. Salt the bottom of the pan evenly, making sure to get in the corners as well. This may not be as easy as it sounds. Put a few pounds of salt in a bowl, cup your fingers together and scoop out about a half a handful - not in your palm. Shake your hand back and forth across the top and about a foot above the top of the pan. As the salt starts to leave your hand, slowly open your fingers and let the salt run through evenly. Hand salting may require some practice. Practice salting the bottom of the pan until it becomes comfortable and the coverage is without gobs or streaks or voids. If this method becomes too frustrating, a shaker top jar works too - a mayonnaise jar with the metal lid poked full of holes by a 16 penny nail. The coverage amount should be between light coverage (barely covering) and full coverage (completely covering) - the only comparison I can think of, is sugar on a pie crust, or, sugar on your cereal. You don't want it too salty, so, one might consider their first batch of jerky experimental and take it from there. String the molasses. Same kinda deal as the salt, hold the bottle about a foot above the pan, start moving it from side to side and pour. When the molasses starts running try to get a 'string' about the size of a pencil lead and let it crisscross the pan bottom over the salt. Once the strings are even in one direction, change directions (perpendicular) and string evenly across again. Don't forget the corners. When it's done it will be an even grid about 1/2\" square covering the pan bottom. Good luck... don't worry, 10-12 layers and you'll be able to sign your name with it. The pepper will vary as to individual taste. One note though, pepper almost doubles its intensity as it soaks and is easy to overpower the finished product. I would recommend that a light dusting would be sufficient for most people (about the way you would pepper a baked potato). Red pepper flakes, even more so. Again, hold the pepper can about a foot above, and dust it evenly - good, you remembered the corners. Layer the meat strips across the bottom of the pan one at a time. Starting on one side, place the strips next to each other without overlapping and with all of the strips running in the same direction. Work the meat across until the layer is complete, without voids. Pat the surface, edges and corners down smooth and flat. Salt, molasses and pepper the surface as was done to the bottom of the pan to start. The second layer of meat is done the same, but it is ran perpendicular to the first layer. Pat smooth, salt, molasses and pepper. Each additional layer is placed perpendicular to the layer before it. Continue layering the meat until it reaches to a level about 2\" from the top of the pan. The last layer, or partial layer, gets the salt, molasses and pepper treatment as well. This brining method will cure the meat in two days. Place the pan in the refer, cover and let sit undisturbed for the first day (refrigeration is not necessary if prepared in a cool climate 35-45F). After about 24 hours the meat should be 'turned' - Dig your hands in the pan and separate all of the strips, turning it over several times to get the meat redistributed into a random order. Mash the meat back down into the brining juices ( at this point the juice will be thin and watery) cover and let sit for another day. I usually taste the juice at this point - if it tastes too salty it can be rinsed with water, but it will not be as good. If the salt is right it will have a slightly sweet, peppery flavor. During this next day the meat will soak up the brine juices and when the meat is removed before smoking, it will have a 'candied'"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"texture - sticky and pliable. There should be very little, if any, brine solution left in the pan. The meat will have soaked up the brine and be somewhat swelled up, as compared to the first turning. Smokehousing the meat: The smoking process will require a smokehouse or smoking unit that is capable of maintaining 80-90F. If there is a small volume, piping the smoke from an external source will provide a cooler smoke, and a hot plate or a few briquettes/lump charcoal could provide the heat source. In a medium size unit (refrigerator size), a cast iron frying pan with chips set on a hot plate will work - although it may be difficult to maintain a constant temperature. The more volume, the easier it is to control the temperature. I would recommend that a fire be built and maintained throughout the smoking process, which will take from 48 to 70 hours - depending upon the thickness of the meat. The smokehouse that I use is medium - large (350) cu.ft., it will maintain a good smoky 80-100F with 2-3 half gallon milk jug sized pieces of wood burning. Use seasoned, barkless wood - your choice, I use red alder, apple, plum, cherry, oak, pear and some of the best I've ever done was with some 75 year old grape stumps. Citrus works good too. Get the smokehouse going and rack or hang the meat while the temp becomes stabilized. If you rack the meat, place it *without* the pieces touching each other - just enough room to run a finger between the strips. Stainless 3/16\" rod sharpened on both ends works good for hanging - again, leave some space between the strips. As you place the strips, run them through your thumb and index finger to squeegee off any excess brine. Before placing the racks or skewers into the smokehouse, coarse black pepper or additional red pepper flakes may be added - for those who like lotsa zip. Load the smokehouse and leave the door cracked open for the first couple hours, or until the surface of the meat has dried to the touch. Close the doors, poke the fire and keep an eye on the temps for a couple of days. Don't worry about the meat spoiling if the fire goes out. The meat is cured. It's said that the old timers used to make their jerky while they traveled. When they made camp at night they would hang the jerky over the campfire until dawn, when they broke camp they simply packed up the jerky and continued smoking the next night. This process takes about 4-5 days and is worth every minute. Probably the two most important items would be too much salt and too much heat. If you decide to try this method, I garr-own-tee you'll never find another piece of store bought jerky that even comes close. Notes: This is a jerky making process that goes back a long way, before refrigerators, before electricity. To the best of my knowledge it has never been written down, just passed along from one old timer to the next - until now... Showing a person how to do something is one thing, but putting it into words is,... an incommodiously arduous task? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 92.

It is important that you remove all fat or it will go rancid. Either grind the meat yourself or have someone grind it for you; a coarse grind gives the best results. Mix the spices thoroughly and then add the spices a bit at a time while kneading the meat like dough. Put the meat in the fridge for at least 6 hours to allow the spices to work through the meat. At this point you prepare the meat for jerking. If you have an electric meat slicer, make the meat into logs about 4 x 14\"; place the meat in the fridge until it is solid but not frozen, and then slice 1/8\" slices from end to end. You'll end up with a big stack of circular patties. If you don't have a slicer, roll the meat out to a 1/8\" thickness between two pieces of wax paper. Remove the top paper and score the meat into strips and place them in the freezer for about 45 minutes. Remove the meat and break at the score marks. Place the jerky on wire racks and place them in a 150 F. oven, leaving the"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"door ajar so moisture can escape and the heat does not build up. Turn the jerky once or twice during drying and rotate the racks if the jerky near the elements begins to dry too fast.

Drying the jerky: Depending on the drying method you're using, evenly coat dehydrator racks or metal racks with cooking spray; if oven drying, place racks over rimmed baking pans. Lift turkey from bowl, shaking off any excess liquid. Arrange strips close together, but not overlapping, on racks. Dehydrator drying: Arrange trays according to manufacture's directions and dry at 140-degrees until a piece of jerky cracks and breaks when bent (4-1/2 to 6 hours; let jerky cool for 5 minutes before testing). Oven drying: Set oven to 140 to 200 degrees (the lower, the better--the lowest your oven allows). Place racks at least 4 inches away from (above or below) heat source. Prop oven door open by about 2 inches. Dry until a piece of jerky cracks and breaks when bent (4 to 6 hours; let jerky cool for 5 minutes before testing). Pat off any beads of oil from jerky. Let jerky cool completely on racks; remove from racks, place in a rigid freezer container, and freeze for 72 hours. Then store in airtight, insectproof containers in a cool, dry place; or freeze or refrigerate. Storage time: Up to 3 weeks at room temperature; up to 4 months in refrigerator; up to 8 months in freezer. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 102.

Trim all fat off the meat and cut against the grain into 1/4\" thick strips. (Meat is easier to cut when partially frozen and it will cut evenly.) In a saucepan, combine beef stock, lime juice, fish sauce, sugar; bring to a boil over high heat. Add mint, shallots, scallions and chiles. Cool and strain. Mix the stock and the other ingredients together in a bowl. Add the meat and cover. Marinade overnight. Or put meat and marinade in a sealable plastic bag. Either way turn the meat occasionally to ensure that all portions get well soaked in the marinade. Remove from marinade and let dry on a rack. Line a cookie sheet with foil and arrange meat on it in a single layer OR... place meat directly on oven racks, line bottom of oven with foil OR... place on a rack in shallow pan. Dry for 6 or more hours at 175, turning after 3 hours. Continue to dry in warm oven if necessary. Gas ovens with pilot lights work especially well. Cool and bag it. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 103.

Roast coriander and cumin seeds in a fry pan over low heat until fragrant, cool, and grind coarsely in a mortar or a spice grinder. Combine beef and the rest of the ingredients and marinate 1 hour. Place beef pieces on a cake rack sprayed with Pam and put the rack in a foil lined cookie sheet large enough to catch any liquid dripping from the beef. Place the cookie sheet in a lowest setting oven until the beef pieces are dry to the touch and no liquid seep out when pressed (between 6-12 hours depending on the oven). Over medium-low heat, heat the oil in a flat-bottomed fry pan and drop the beef in 5-6 pieces at a time. Fry until crispy on the outside and around the edges. Drain on a cake rack over paper towels. Keeps up to 1 week in an airtight container at room temperature. Serve alone or with cooked sticky rice. NOTE: Tenderize beef lightly with a mallet if using other cuts of beef. Be sure to drain the oil well. Any excess may become rancid. Cool completely before storing. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 104.

I usually take a 1 lb cube, cut it in half,and then slice it into strips on its short side. Strips should be about 4-5 mm in thickness. They may look big, but they'll shrink to about half their size. Mix all the marinade ingredients together well. Put the tofu in a single layer in a shallow baking pan or cookie sheet and pour the marinade over it. Let soak for several hours or overnight. Drain excess liquid (and reuse!) and dry tofu in food dehydrator or warm (200 F) oven. This will take probably 4-8 hours, depending on the weather. If you live in a sunny, dry climate, you can sun dry it, but it'll take all day. If you dry indoors in the winter, your house gets filled with a wonderful smoky smell. If you're drying in the oven, you'll need to flip the tofu over hourly so it dries evenly. The stuff is delicious and keeps indefinitely. Dry the stuff until it's very chewy, but not crispy. Be creative: Use low-sodium soy if you want less salt (it is rather salty). Use tabasco or ground cayenne if you want it hot. Chili powder makes chili jerky. Oregano and basil makes pizza jerky. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 105. TRIPLE MEAT JERKY 1 pound of chicken breast 1 pound of pork 1 pound of beef 1/4 cup of soy sauce 3 tablespoons of brown sugar 1 tablespoon of dijonnaise from Hellemans 1 tablespoon of Louisiana hot sauce 3 tablespoons of ketchup Salt and pepper 1 clove of garlic minced 1 onion minced 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire Sauce 2 tablespoons of liquid smoke (found in grocery stores) Cut meat into strips, remember that the meat will shrink. Mix seasoning together, and add to meat. If you have a convection oven, put the temp at 150 degrees. Put the strips of meat on a rack, that you will put over a pan. Place in oven, place a wooden spoon, so the oven door will not close completely. It takes between 6-8 hours. Turn the strips from time to time. Once the dehydration process is over, and the strips cool off, you may keep them in a glass jar or in the fridge for a long time. If you have a regular oven , put the temp at the lowest. You will need to keep the oven door open wider, turning the strips even more often, and the cooking time will probably vary. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 106.

Cut breast piece with or across the grain, and tenderloins lengthwise. In a bowl, stir together salt, water, brown sugar, garlic, onion, pepper, and liquid smoke. Add turkey and mix well. Cover and chill at least 1 hour or up to 24 hours; meat will absorb most of the liquid. Depending on drying method, evenly coat dehydrator racks, (you need 3, each about 10 by 13 in.) or metal racks (to cover a 10- by 15-inch baking pan) with nonstick cooking spray. Lift turkey strips from liquid, shaking off excess, and lay strips close together, but not overlapping, on racks. In a dehydrator: Arrange trays as manufacturer directs and dry at 140 until a cool piece of jerky (remove from dehydrator and let stand about 5 minutes) cracks and breaks when bent, about 4 1/2 to 5 hours. In an oven: Set at 150-200, place pan on center rack; prop door open about 2 inches. Dry until a piece of jerky cracks and breaks when bent (see above), about 3-5 hours. Let jerky cool on racks, then remove. Serve or store in airtight containers in a cool, dry place up to 3 weeks, in the refrigerator up to 4 months, or longer in the freezer. Makes about 7 ounces.

WORLD FAMOUS BEEF JERKY Soy sauce Worcestershire sauce Brown sugar Crushed garlic Hot pepper sauce (Tabasco or other) Red cooking wine Jamaican Jerk seasoning or A-1 sauce Start with several pounds of very lean beef roast. You should choose a roast with visible grain, if possible, and little or no fat. It needn't be very high quality, and in fact, tougher cuts seem to actually work better. Mix a marinade with some or all of the following: Mixing the sauce is largely a matter of taste. The result should be close to 3 parts soy sauce, 1 part Worcestershire, 1 part brown sugar and the rest as desired. It should be a very strong salty, spicy and slightly sweet solution. The rest of the"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"ingredients depend on your taste, and the list is by no means exhaustive. Adding red wine will decrease the saltiness and/or dilute it if you get it too spicy without affecting the flavor greatly. You should not use more than about 30 to 40% red wine, however, since the saltiness is necessary to preserve the meat. Don't get too hung up on the recipe, it is good just about any way you fix it. With a very sharp knife, slice the uncooked roast with the grain (usually lengthwise down the roast) into strips about 1/8 inch thick. Thinner will make the jerky spicier and crisper, thicker, up to about 1/4 inch will make it easier to slice, but increases drying time. Trim fat once again, and put the slices in a large Ziploc bag with the marinade. Squeeze to remove as much air as possible, and have a helper seal the bag. Let soak at room temperature for at least an hour. Remove the strips and place in a dehydrator. Spread them in a single layer on each rack, and sprinkle with great quantities of black pepper on one side. Dry on high (145 degrees) in the dehydrator, or turn your oven temperature selector until the light just comes on (the lowest setting possible) and dry on a rack in the oven. In the oven, prop the door open about 3 inches at the top. Drying time is about 8 to 10 hours, but can take twice that long for thicker pieces. Bending should splinter some of the outside fibers when done. It should keep at room temperature for a couple of weeks, and will actually get better in a day or two as the moisture content becomes more uniform throughout."}]
