It provides guidance for leaders conducting traini ng in urban environments across the full spectrum of Army operations: offense, defe nse, stability, and support. The focus of this circular is on effective usage of the home station urban training facilities: Urban Assault Course (UAC), Shoot House (SH), Breach Fa cility (BF), and Combined Arms Collective Training Facility (CACTF). Although the primar y focus of this circular is on the four primary home station facilities, with modificat ion it can also support urban training in non- standard facilities.

DEFINITIONS The following includes some defi nitions of urban operations: a. Full Spectrum Operations . Full spectrum operations include offensive, defensive, stability, and support (ODSS) opera tions. Missions in any environment require Army forces to conduct or be prepared to conduct any combination of ODSS operations. b. Urban Operations . The urban operations (UO) are operations planned and conducted in an area of operations (AO) that includes one or more urban areas. Army forces normally conduct full-spectrum UO in urban environments. Often, the rules of engagement (ROE) and use of combat power are more restrictive than in other environments. c. Urban Area . An urban area is a topogra phical complex where manmade construction or high-population density is the dominant feat ures. The five categories of urban areas: • Villages (population less than 3,000). • Towns (population of 3,000 to 100,000). • Cities (population over 100,000 to 1 million inhabitants). • Metropolis (population over 1 m illion to 10 million inhabitants). • Megalopolis (population over 10 million). Brigades normally bypass, move through, defe nd from, and attack objectives within villages. Brigades normally participate in UO in towns, cities, metropolises, and megalopolises as part of a larger force. d. Urban Operations Under Precision Conditions . Under precision UO conditions, either the enemy is so thor oughly mixed with noncombatants or political considerations are such that the use of more highly restrict ive ROE and different tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP), ma y be required during the execution of UO. Conventional Army forces routinely conduct UO under precision conditions. e. Urban Operations Under High-Intensity Conditions . These conditions include combat operations against a determined enemy occupying prepared positions or conducting deliberate attacks against friendl y forces. High-intensity UO require the synchronization of the full combat power of the joint combined arms team. Conventional Army forces must always be prepared to conduct UO under high-intensity conditions. 1-2. TRAINING STRATEGY Urban terrain and environmental conditions challenge the trainer. The UO training strategy integrates live, virt ual, and constructive training (Figure 1-1, page 1-2). Live, virtual, and constructive training is base d on the unit’s METL. The live environment consists of home station trai ning using the urban operations facilities (Urban Assault Course [UAC], SH, battle force [BF], co mbined arms collective training facility [CACTF]), Combat Tr aining Centers (CTC) rotations, and any other live training that supports the UO collective tasks list. The virtua l environment consists of simulators such"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"TC 90-1 1-2 as close combat tactical trainer (CCTT) or e ngagement skills trainer (EST) used to train small-unit leaders and crews. The constructiv e environment consists of battle staff training for battalion and above staff and l eaders such as joint conflict and tactical simulation (JCATS)/OneSAF. Figure 1-1. Live, virtual, constructive training support strategy. FMs 25-100 and 25-101 explain how to determin e a unit's METL and battle tasks, and how to plan, provide resource s for, and execute training events. Due to limited training facilities, it is important that leaders use all available assets to train and maintain combat readiness. Specific FMs, TCs, and ARTEP MTPs provide the TTPs and standards to conduct and evaluate training. A complete training program emphasizes initial, intermediate, and culminating UO training (Figure 1-2). a. Initial Training . This training is the first step in the building-block approach and sets the basis for unit or collective training. Mastery of individual a nd crew skills is an essential precondition for UO training. Initia l-UO training includes but is not limited to precision marksmanship, EST, crew simulators and CCTTs. 102 URBAN OPERATIONS TRAINING SUPPORT STRATEGY LIVE CONSTRUCTIVE Urban Operations Training WARSIM (DIV/CORPS) •WFX (BCTP) JCATS/OneSAF (BDE & below ) •STAFFEX •CPX •JTX HOME STATION FACILITIES (BN & below) •BREACH FACILITY •URBAN ASSAULT COURSE •SHOOT HOUSE •CACTF COMBAT TRAINING CENTERS (BDE&BN) NTC JRTC CMTC MISSION REHEARSAL EXERCISE COMBINED ARMS TACTICAL TRAINERS (CO/PLT/Crew) AVCATT ENCATT CCTT FSCATT EST ADCATT Need Urban Operations terrain and weapons effects incorporated into Virtual and Constructive environment VIRTUAL IMBEDDED TRAINER"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"TC 90-1 1-3 Figure 1-2. Urban operations strategy ― live, virtual, and constructive training. b. Intermediate Training . This phase of training is characterized by unit collective training and leaders varying th e training conditions (limited visibility, different entry techniques, different entry points, use of combatants and noncombatants, OPFOR, MILES, and live-fire exercises) under which tasks are perfor med. Collective task training is the critical link between individual tasks and mi ssion accomplishment. Intermediate training should be conducted at , but is not limited to, the br each facility, live-fire shoot house, and UAC. Figures 1-3 th rough 1-6 show the design and the purpose for each of these facilities. (1) Breach Facility . The purpose of this facility is to train soldiers on the technical aspects of the breaching techni ques (Figure 1-3). This faci lity is used to train TTPs, mechanical, ballistic, therma l, and explosive techniques. Figure 1-3. Breach facility. (2) Shoot House .

Units are trained and evaluate d on their ability to move tactically and engage targets, while practicing target discrimination in an urban environment. NOTE : The specific design of the shoot house a nd all other faciliti es may differ based on unique training requirements at different installations. Figure 1-4. Shoot house. (3) Urban Assault Course . The purpose of the UAC facility is to train squad-size units using the task Enter a Building/Clear a Room, grenadier gunnery, and subterranean TTPs. However, the unit's training requireme nts determine the size of the unit and the tasks to be trained. The unit de velops its organizational stru cture and steps for conducting the exercise based on its METL and on their training needs (Figure 1-5)."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"TC 90-1 1-5 Figure 1-5. Urban assault course. c. Culminating Training . During this phase of training, multiechelon, combined arms, and branch specific STX training may be conducted. Culminating training is conducted at the CACTF (Figure 1-6, page 1-6)."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"TC 90-1 1-6 Figure 1-6. Combined arms collective training facility. d. Conduct of Training . Depending on unit proficiency, every training event should follow a crawl-walk-run sequence, ba sed on clearly defined standards. (1) Crawl . The trainer explains each training ob jective and performance standards, and then talks the soldiers through the exercise, step by step, describing what each individual or unit must do. This tr aining often includes a demonstration. (2) Walk . The soldiers slowly practice each task to standard. Trainers coach soldiers at this stage stopping as often as needed to correct mistakes and provide feedback. Soldiers practice each task repeatedly until they can perf orm it to standard. (3) Run . Soldiers perform each task at full sp eed as if they are in combat. The soldiers need feedback during this stage as well. The following can be used to enhance realism: • Blank ammunition. • Special effects small-arms marking system (SESAMS). • Short-range training ammunition (SRTA). • Service ammunition. • Targetry. • Pyrotechnics. • Tactical engagement systems (MILES). • Opposing forces (force on force). • Nuclear, biological, and chemical simu lation/weapons of mass destruction. • Training in limited visibility conditions."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"TC 90-1 1-7 e. After-Action Review . Leaders conduct an after-act ion review (AAR) after each training event to help soldiers and units improve their skills by providing immediate feedback. An AAR increases the benefits ga ined from each training exercise by allowing the leader and soldiers to wo rk together to analyze the pe rformance of each task. Being involved in this analysis enables the soldiers to learn and retain mo re than they would if they were simply critiqued. An AAR improves the performance of soldiers, leaders, and unit tasks and provides the commander with information and insight that he needs to evaluate training. 1-3. PREREQUISITE TRAINING Prerequisite training teaches individuals, crews, units, lead ers, and command and staff what they need to know before they can perform a task. Prere quisite training builds teamwork at all levels. a. Command and Staff Training . The battalion battle st aff and leadership must train themselves before the execution of battalion collective training. The battalion command and staff culminates their prerequi site training with UO tactical exercise without troops (TEWTs) and UO command post exercises (CPXs). This procedure helps develop urban operations TTPs and un it standing operating procedure (SOP). b. Leader Training . A comprehensive leader’s training program is the key to successful UO training. Time spent teaching battalion leaders (trainers) during the planning and preparation phase pays dividends during the in termediate and culminating phases of training. Leader’s training complim ents institutional instruction (Basic and Career Officer Course, Basic Noncommissione d Officer Course [BNCOC], or Advanced Noncommissioned Officer Course [ANCOC], of current UO doctrine [FM 90-10 and FM 90-10-1], and unit knowledge based on e xperience and prio r training events). Recommended subject areas include threat an alysis, urban area and building analysis, weapons effects on urban structures, urban attack and defense, UO TTP, STP, and SOP development. c. Individual Training . Many urban-specific tasks and skills can be trained, sustained, and maintained in a barracks envir onment. Other tasks can be trained at local UO facilities, and weapons ranges. The unit should focus on three general areas for preliminary training; urban combat skills , urban marksmanship skills, and physical fitness. (1) The following are examples of pr eliminary training tasks and or TTPs: • Individual movement techniques. • Battle drills. • Weapon positioning in an urban area. • Roadblock and vehicle search procedures. • Dismounted and mounted urban navigation. • Urban scanning techniques. • Quick fire techniques. • Assault fire techniques. • Hasty urban firing positions. • Prepared urban firing positions."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"TC 90-1 1-8 (2) Prior to urban collective training cycle, trainers can develop urban-specific firing conditions in conjunction with weapons firi ng ranges. Build facades on existing ranges, or use the unit’s local UAC (if avai lable). Urban combat skills include: • Firing positions behind r ubble, around corners, from windows or rooftops. • Urban targets behind rubble , in windows and doorways. • Fire commands. • Lifting and shifting fires from lower to upper story windows. • Fire control and fire discipline. • Rapid firing engagements. • ROE firing scenarios. (3) Urban physical fitn ess skills include: • Endurance runs and upper body conditioning. • Vaulting exercises. • Urban-Specific Obstacle Course negotiation. • Leadership Reaction Course (LRC) negotiation. 1-4. INDIVIDUAL TASK TRAINING Urban operations require the soldier to be pr oficient in several individual tasks unique to urban fighting. Additional urban fighting t echniques have been developed based on combat lessons learned and on evolving technology. a. Army doctrine includes three individual urban-specific tasks: STP 7-11BCHM14-SM-TG . • 071-326-0541, Perform Movement Techniques During MOUT. • 071-326-0550, Prepare Positions for I ndividual and Crew-Served Weapons During MOUT. • 071-326-0557, Select Hasty Firi ng Positions During MOUT. b. FM 90-10-1, An Infantryman’s Guide to Combat in Built-up Areas: (1) Movement Techniques . • Crossing of a wall. • Movement around corners. • Movement past windows. • Use of doorways. • Movement parallel to buildings. • Crossing of open areas. • Fire team employment. • Movement between positions. • Movement inside a building. (2) Entry Techniques . • Upper building levels. • Use of ladders. • Scaling of walls. • Entry at lower levels. • Hand grenades. (3) Firing Positions : • Hasty firing position."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"TC 90-1 1-9 • Prepared firing position. • Target acquisition. • Employment of snipers. 1-5. COLLECTIVE TASK TRAINING Squads, platoons, and companies train on co llective tasks IAW ARTEP MTPs. However, only a few of these tasks specifically addre ss UO; the others must be adapted for the urban environment. a. Urban-specific tasks at squad and platoon level include the following tasks: (1) ARTEP 7-8-MTP . • 07-3-1134, Conduct Tactical Movement (Mech Infantry Platoon). • 07-3-4141, Clear Built-up Area/Building (Infantry/Mech Infantry Platoon). • 07-3-1123, Defend Built-up Area/Build ing (Infantry Platoon/Squad). (2) ARTEP 7-7J-MTP . • 71-2-0331.07-3126, Conduct Tactical Moveme nt (Infantry Platoon Mounted). • 71-3-1110, Clear a Building. • 71-2-2026.07-3418, Defend Built-up Area /Building (Infantry Platoon Mounted). • 07-3-4141Clear Built-up Area/Building (Infantry/Mech Infantry Platoon). b. Urban-specific tasks for the in fantry company are as follows: (1) ARTEP 7-10-MTP . • 07-2-1134, Conduct Tactical Movement (Infantry Company). • 07-2-1109, Assault Built-up Area/Building. • 07-2-1118, Defend Built-up Area/Building (Infantry Company). • 07-2-1401, Establish a Roadblock/Ch eckpoint (Infantry Company). (2) ARTEP 71-1-MTP . • 71-2-1016.17-00KC, Conduct Tactical Movement. • 07-5-1097, Clear a Building. • 71-2-2026.17-00KC, Defend Built-up Area. • 71-2-2025.17-00KC, Clear Built-up Area. • 71-2-2027.17-00KC, Cordon and Search. c. Urban-specific tasks for the company team and infantry battalions are as follows: • ARTEP 7-20-MTP . -- 07-1-3004, Conduct Tactical Movement (Battalion). -- 71-1-2025.07-1164, Clear a Built-up Area. -- 71-1-9220.07-1162, Traverse a Built-up Area (Battalion). -- 71-1-9262.07-1163, Defend in a Built-up Area (Battalion). d. Urban-specific tasks for stability and support operations. The following tasks are samples that are listed in TC 7-98-1 : • Perform Cordon and Search. • Search and Attach. • Checkpoints. • Disturbance. • Control Civilian Movement. • Conduct Platoon Riot Control Formation."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"TC 90-1 1-10 • Apprehend/Detain Noncombatants. NOTE : See FM 90-10-1 for a review of additional stability and support operations including but not limited to: • Conduct Area Security Patrol. • Conduct Convoy Escort. • Open and Clear Routes. • Cordon and Search. e. The commander uses the battalion integrated training plan to es tablish the goals of the training density. He focuses on combin ed arms operations, emphasizing dismounted infantry maneuver. Tanks, BFVs, attack aviation and artillery normally provide supporting fires for the dismounted elements. The CS elements should be integrated at every level to ensure the battalion is prepared to fight as a task force (TF). The battalion CSS system is stressed during UO. The condi tions of the urban environment, resupply, casualty evacuation, maintenance, and sustai nment should be trained concurrently at every level within the battalion. Freque ncy of UO training is recommended to be semiannual for the CACTF, shoot house, and breach facility and quarterly for the UAC. Army training calendars are divided into cycles of training; mission, and support. Figures 1-7 and 1-8 below depict how the ur ban training strategy and facility usage might be programmed into unit cycles. Figure 1-7. Active Army home-station urban operations training strategy.

Army National Guard urban operations training strategy. 1-6. RISK ASSESSMENT Risk assessment means making operations safer without compromising the mission (FM 25-101). Commanders continuously assess th e risk of training conditions to prevent unnecessary loss of soldiers and equipment. The degree of risk depends on conditions. Just as this principle applies to other training and warfighti ng, it also applies to UO. In a training situation, for example, commanders determine whether soldiers and leaders have conducted this type of trai ning before, whether conducting initial training at night or during limited visibility, and whether soldie rs are tired or exhausted. Risk assessment ensures UO training is not only tough and realistic but also safe. Training enhancers, such as live fire, blank ammunition, simulators, fi res, smoke, and other pyrotechnics, must be fully employed to achieve the training objectives . Soldiers are required to wear earplugs, protective vests, and protectiv e eyewear in order to protec t themselves from noise and debris. a. The commander considers risk and safety in urban operations training situations such as: (1) Soldiers engaging in close combat urba n operations need to be safety conscious when using blanks, booby traps, and practice grenades. They may be unaware of the exact location of the OPFOR and may be su sceptible to OPFOR flash suppressors, booby traps, and practice hand grenades. (2) Soldiers may use ladders to enter buildings at upper stories, which creates the potential for dangerous falls. b. The commander is the safety officer, but soldiers and leaders are responsible for safe training. All leaders must: (1) Use mission, enemy, terrain, troops, time available, and civilians (METT-TC) factors to identify risks. (2) Assess possible losses and their costs.

The UAC contains five stations: Individual and Team Task/Technique Trainer Station 1, Squad and Platoon Ta sk/Technique Trainer Station 2, Grenadier Gunnery Trainer Stati on 3, Urban Offense/Defense Building Station 4, and the Underground Traine r Station 5. These stations are designed for individual tasks and sm all-unit collective task training. Various types of organizations with a variety of missions can train at the UAC. Tactical operations in an urban environment may include combat to stability and support tasks. The UAC is a dismounted training facility. 2-1. PURPOSE The purpose is to provide squad and platoon size units with a f acility to train and evaluate urban operations tasks (Figure 2-1). With th e exception of Station 3, Grenadier Gunnery, the UAC is not intended for live-fire traini ng. Station 3, Grenadier Gunnery Trainer, is designed to support 40-mm TP and 5.56-mm service ammunition. Figure 2-1. Urban assault course. a. Facility Description . The UAC has five training st ations that facilitate the crawl/walk/run training concept."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"TC 90-1 2-2 (1) Station 1, Individual and Team Trainer . This station is a three-room trainer where team leaders and squad leaders train the basics of building and room clearing. (2) Station 2, Squad and Platoon Trainer . This station is a four-structure trainer with multiple rooms. Squads build upon tasks lear ned at Station 1 and begin to learn the concepts of clearing multiple buildings. The st ation is designed in such a way that it can be used as individual buildings with a narrow street or as rooms inside a building with a long connecting hallway. (3) Station 3, Grenadier Gunnery Trainer . This station is a li ve-fire station where M203 gunners master target engagements in an urban area, move tactically, and respond to the fire commands. (4) Station 4, Offense/Defense House . This station is where a platoon can train to attack and or defend a building. This station can also be divided into a number of smaller training stations to reinforce tr aining or to train tasks not yet trained at the other stations. (For example, upper-level entry techniques.) (5) Station 5, Underground Trainer . This station provides training for subterranean operations. b. Targetry . Targets throughout the UAC are ei ther 3D precision targets (for engagements less than 50 meters) or 2D non- precision targets (for engagements greater than 50 meters). (1) Precision targets support short distance engagements. Sensors contained within the precision target respond only to lethal shot placement. The torso lethal zone is 18 inches by 8 inches and the neck-head lethal zone is 4 inches by 8 inches. (2) Non-precision targets support engageme nts that are at ranges greater than 50 meters. These targets ar e 2D pop-up type targets. c. Training Audience . The facility provides Infantr y, Engineer, Military Police, Cavalry, and other units with a facility to train the individual soldier through platoon-level UO skills. d. Training Information .

A landing is located along the length of the second floor with outside stairs leading down. An inside stairway also joins the floors. The two legs of the L are adjacent, with no access between them to their interiors. (2) Building Two has a single floor and tw o rooms; each room has a window and a doorway. An open area much like a street se parates this structure from the first. (3) Building Three is a structure that looks like a row of buildi ngs along a street. The structure is made of wood and has many wi ndows and doorways. At the far end of the structure is an adjoining room. (4) Building Four is a structure to the left that is a mirror image of building three. It also has a wall on the si de at the near end. NOTE : Units can place additional walls in all the structures by using target cloth or some other material to add to the num ber of rooms or co mplexity of the training (Appendix A). b. Targetry . Targets present realistic close quarters combat situations (0 to 15 meters), consisting of a possible mixtur e of combatant and noncombatant targets. Target discrimination is traine d by presenting up to ten precisi on targets. Targetry sensors respond only to lethal shot placement and also facilitate training during limited visibility. c. Controller Requirements . As required by unit. d. Safety Requirements . (1) While not intended as a live-fire sta tion, it is capable of supporting live-fire training.

DESCRIPTION This facility has two parts, the live-fire fa cility and the AAR room. The live-fire facility is a single-level structure with a barn roof , catwalk, and eight adjo ining rooms with video capture capability that should be used for AARs. The walls are bullet proof and prevent ricochets. There are four entrances, one on each side of the facility. Replaceable blow panels that can accommodate reduced DES ar e located throughout the facility for entry into the building by means ot her than through doors. The s hoot house has a crane system in the roof that allows for removal of doorwa ys and blow panels not needed for training and replace those panels with solid wall sections. This give s the unit the ability to vary the training scenarios. Unit’s can conduct explosive and mechanical breaches. For safety reasons, there are no windows in the structur e (Figure 3-1, page 3-2). The AAR building has a conference/AAR room that can accomm odate up to a platoon size element, an instrumentation and targetry control room, a nd an AAR edit and projection room that can facilitate a formal AAR (Figure 3-2, page 3-2)."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"TC 90-1 3-2 Figure 3-1.

TRAINING AUDIENCE The facility provides leaders the ability to train and evalua te the unit duri ng a live-fire exercise. However, the unit's training requirem ents determine the size of the unit and the tasks to be trained at this f acility. The unit develops its ow n organization and the steps for conducting the exercise based on its METL and training needs. 3-4. TRAINING INFORMATION Tactical operations in an urban environment may range from combat missions to stability and support missions. Commanders should note that the shoot house is not suited for the employment of live-fragmentation/conc ussion grenades, 40-mm HE/HEDP, antiarmor weapons, mortars, artillery, or air delivere d munitions. Crew-served weapon systems, M2 and M1 tanks, and machine guns can be empl oyed against supplementa l targetry that is exterior to the shoot house. The shoot house ha s specially constructed areas that are used to conduct either mechanical and or expl osive breaching techniques. When conducting explosive breaching, units s hould consult with local E ngineers for appropriate DES charges and consult Appendix A before conducting the training. 3-5. CONDUCT OF TRAINING The unit develops realistic time frames for each operation or task. The times are based on the crawl, walk, and run concept. The traini ng event or STX can be arranged in any order as long as they follow a tactical scenar io.

Execution . Tables 3-1 through 3-5, pages 3- 4 through 3-7, depicts sequence of events and Figure 3-3 through Figure 3- 6, pages 3-6 through 3-9, provides example scenarios. This table is only an example and the unit should deve lop its training events based on METL tasks and training needs. Ho wever, the leader should do the following when conducting training at the live-fire shoot house: (1) Identify the unit’s critical missions (see commander’s training guidance) and select those tasks that support specif ic tasks related to urban operations. (2) Arrange the related tasks in the order of their importance to mission accomplishment. (3) Assess the unit’s current le vel of proficiency (stren gths and weaknesses) and determine the degree of difficulty of each ta sk. The training events and scenarios should start from the least difficult to the most difficu lt tasks to instill conf idence in the soldiers conducting the training. (4) Identify the individual and leader tasks that are to be trained. (5) Conduct individual training first, because it is the first step in the building-block approach and is the basis for unit or collec tive task training. The mastery of individual skills is an essential prec ondition for effective training. (6) Set up training conditions based on unit pr oficiency. At first, conditions are basic until proficiency is attained. Increased difficu lty and realism are incorporated as training progresses (limited visibility, NBC factors, and live fires with service or SRTA)."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"TC 90-1 3-4 (7) Understand that the live-fire shoot house is a live-fire traini ng facility; however, this facility is designed to accommodate any level of tr aining proficiency (blank, TES, SESAM, SRTA, and ball).

Mast ery of individual skills is an essential precondition for urban operations training and a good method fo r conducting individual training is through concurrent training. Concurre nt training is designed to train groups of soldiers on different tasks or techniques and these tasks or techniques may or may not be related. For example, a leader may subdivide the unit at th e breach facility into breaching orders. One group of soldiers may be conducting an ex plosive breach, while other groups are conducting mechanical and ballistic breach es. Ballistic breaching and explosive breaching does have a SDZ, an MSD, and ricochet considerations. 4-8. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS Safety requires effort on the pa rt of everyone. It is not enough to teach safety rules; the rules must be practiced and enforced. Depe nding on the nature of the obstacle that must be breached, the breacher may use anyone of the following techniques: mechanical, ballistic or explosive techniques. The following guidelines should be followed when training at the Breach Facility. Wear all ap propriate personal pr otective equipment and follow appropriate guidelines: • Safety glasses. • Hearing protection. • Body armor. • Helmet. • Gloves. • Elbow and knee pads. • Inspect equipment before use. • Use appropriate tool. • Use appropriate amount of explosiv e not to exceed 4 blocks of C4."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"TC 90-1 4-7 • Stay within the surface danger zone. • Always use the minimum safe distance. • Do not modify tool. • Ensure proper use and main tenance of hydraulic and pneumatic tools; tools can burst under pressure when improperly used."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"TC 90-1 5-1 CHAPTER 5 COMBINED ARMS COLLECTIVE TRAINING FACILITY The home station CACTF is a training facility designed to conduct multi-echelon, full-spectrum operations training up to battalion TF level. Sample company and platoon STX lanes, and support and stability operations tasks, are provided to a ssist the units in developing training plans. 5-1. PURPOSE The leader or commander is provided with a CACTF to evaluate unit urban operations proficiency. The CACTF is intended to s upport blank fire, MILES/TES, SESAMS, STX, and FTX scenarios on a semiannual basis. The CACTF supports branch-specific lane training and combined arms training up to battalion level across the full spectrum of operations: offense, defense, stability, and support. 5-2. DESCRIPTION The CACTF replicates an urban environm ent. The facility consists of 2.25 square kilometers of urban sprawl with 20 to 26 buildings, roads, alleys, parking areas, underground sewers, parks, athletic fields, and command and control building. The actual size and configuration of the CACTF depends on the local installation site requirements. The CACTF is designed to support heavy and light infantry, armor, artillery, and aviation positioning and maneuver. Table 5-1 shows the recommended types of buildings and features in the CACTF. 20 TO 26 BUILDINGS (1.5 km by 1.5 km) • Tunnel/sewer system. • Shanty town. • One, three-story building. • Three, two-story buildings. • Industrial area. • Electricity and potable water. • City dump. • Props/furniture. • Targetry. • Audio/image capture with an EDIT/REPLAY. • Control Building with AAR facility. • Breachable walls. Table 5-1. CACTF characteristics. a. The buildings have one, two, or three st ories (some with basements), sloped and flat roofs. CACTF building variations pose different tactical and technical training challenges. Figure 5-1 depicts an exampl e CACTF containing 24 buildings with the following characteristics: (1) The hotel is a dominating structure typi cal of a central business district. The hotel has an elevator shaft, fire escapes, and a large first-floor lobby. (2) The two-story office building contains a series of identical rooms. (3) The school has a long, central corridor, large windows, and a single large room. (4) The townhouse has multiple sections with a common attic. (5) The service station accommodates combat vehicles in its service bay."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"TC 90-1 5-2 b. The buildings have other features that enhance the CACTF's training value. (1) Constructed mouse-holes permit movement between rooms and floors. (2) Loopholes in roofs and outside walls allow observation and fields of fire. (3) Roof hatchways lead to the top floors of multiple story buildings. (4) Rooms vary in size and in quantity of doorways and windows.

TACTICAL EXERCISE WITHOUT TROOPS A terrain walk and a TEWT may be conducte d in a local downtown area to prepare leaders and to take advantage of the ava ilable time in the CACTF. Terrain walks and TEWTs are conducted to teach leaders the t actical value of urban terrain. Appendix A contains training tips and additional information regarding the conduct of a TEWT. 5-4. URBAN OPERATIONS COLLECTI VE TRAINING EXERCISES Leaders use training exercises to train, evaluate, and practice performance-oriented collective tasks. TEWT, STX, and FTX are th e three types of exercises covered in this chapter. Each is designed to help the trai ner develop urban operations training skills and increase unit proficiency in an urban envi ronment. The urban operations collective training exercises were developed using the standard CACTF described in this chapter and may be modified to fit available urban ope rations facilities. This chapter contains the following examples of STX and FTX scenarios and OPORDs. • Infantry Rifle Platoon Attack STX. • Mechanized Infantry Platoon Defend STX. • Infantry Rifle Company Attack FTX. • Mechanized Infantry Company Team Defend FTX. a. These exercises were developed based on the principles outlined in ARTEPs, MTPs, and on the guidance provided in FM 25-101, FM 25-4, and TC 7-98-1. b. This chapter provides examples of offe nsive and defensive scenarios for combat in urban areas. Paragraphs 5-5 and 5-6 in clude two platoon STXs, and paragraphs 5-7 and 5-8 include two company FTXs. Each of the example scenarios can be conducted with blank fire, MILES/TES, 9-mm/5.56-mm SE SAMS for short-range precision target engagements (less than 50 meters), or force on force. The example exercises are designed to help the commander develop, sustain, and evaluate the unit's mission proficiency. CAUTION Trainers must ensure that fighting position reinforcement does not exceed the weight lim its of the buildings in order to avoid structural damage and safety hazards to the soldiers."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"TC 90-1 5-5 5-5. INFANTRY RIFLE PLATOON STX ATTACK ============================================================== = INFANTRY RIFLE PLATOON SITUATIONAL TRAINING EXERCISE ATTACK 1. Objective.

ARTEP 7-8-MTP (Chapter 4) , FM 25-100, and FM 25-101 provide training guidance, tips, and enhancers for planning and executing STXs. The trainer should review the individual, leader, and coll ective tasks to be performed during the STX to determine the ones that require initial or refresher training. b. General Situation . (1) The exercise scenario is as follows: Contact with the enemy has been reestablished. Initial reports indicate he is at 65 to 70 percent strength and has not been reinforced. His defensive positions are located in the CACTF and are not well established. He has the capability for indir ect fire and CAS; he has already used chemicals and will probably do so again. The platoon receives an order to prevent the enemy from establishing a heavily fortified de fense in the CACTF. Such a defense could prevent friendly forces from continuing offensive operations. (2) This exercise begins when the plat oon leader receives the company FRAGO, and it ends after the platoon consolidates and reorganizes on the objective. An AAR should be held after completing the task, React to C ontact, and at the completion of the exercise. If necessary, portions of the exercise shoul d be repeated until the platoon performs them to standard. Figure 5-4 provides a graphic s cenario of task performance for the STX Attack.

CONSIDERATIONS FO R TRAINING WITH ARMOR Built-up areas consist mainly of man-made f eatures such as buildings, streets, and subterranean systems. These features of urba n terrain create a variety of tactical problems and possibilities. In order to ensure that th e tank platoon can operate effectively in the urban environment, the platoon observation and direct-fire plans must address the ground-level or surface fight (in streets and on the ground floor of buildings), the above ground fight (intra-surface and super-surface), and the subterranean fight (Figure 5-14). Infantry can assist the tank platoon by ― • Locating targets for tanks to engage. • Destroying antitank weapons. • Assaulting enemy positions and clearing buildings with tank support. • Protecting tanks from antitank fires."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"TC 90-1 5-38 Figure 5-14. Urban battle space. a. Transporting Infantry . At times, the tank platoon is required to transport infantrymen on its tanks (as illustrated in Fi gure 5-15). This technique is done only when contact is not expected. If the platoon is moving as part of a larger force and is tasked to provide security for the move, the lead section or element should not carry infantry. Figure 5-15. Sample positions for infantry riding on a tank . M249"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"TC 90-1 5-39 Infantry and armor leaders must observe the following procedures, precautions, and considerations when infantrymen ride on tanks: a. Infantry should thoroughly practice m ounting and dismounting procedures and actions on contact. b. Infantry must always alert the TC before mounting or dismounting. They must follow the commands of the TC. c. Infantry platoons should be broken down into squad-size groups, similar to air assault chalks, with the infantry platoon leader on the armor platoon leader’s vehicle and the infantry PSG on the armor PSG’s vehicle. d. Platoon leaders, PSGs, and team leaders should position themselves near the TC’s hatch, using the external phone (if available) to talk to the TC and relay signals to the unit. e. If possible, the lead vehicle should not carry infantrymen. Riders restrict turret movement and are more likely to be injured or killed on initial contact. f. Whenever possible, Infantrymen should mount and dismount over the left front slope of the vehicle. This procedure ensures that the driver can see the infantrymen and that the Infantrymen do not pass in front of the coax machine gun. Infantrymen must ensure that they remain behind the vehicle’s smoke grenade launchers. This will automatically keep them clear of all weapon systems. g. Infantrymen must always have three point s of contact with the vehicle; they must watch for low-hanging objects such as tree branches. h. All Infantrymen should wear hearing protection. i. Infantrymen should not ride with anythi ng more than their battle gear. Rucksacks and B-bags should be transported by other means. j. Infantrymen should scan in all directions. They may be able to spot a target the vehicle crew does not see. k. Passengers should be prepared to take the following actions on contact: • Wait for the vehicle to stop. • At the TC’s command, dismount IMMEDIATELY (one fire team on each side). DO NOT move forward of the turret. • Move at least 5 meters to the sides of the vehicle. DO NOT move behind or forward of the vehicle. • DO NOT move in front of vehicles unless ordered to do so. Main gun discharge overpressure can inflict sever injury or death to forward dismounts. See Figure 5-16 and warning below. • DO NOT move in front of vehicles unless ordered to do so. Main gun discharge overpressure can inflict sever injury or death to forward dismounts. • DO NOT dismount a vehicle unless ordered or given permission to do so. • DO NOT dangle arms or legs, equipment, or anything else off the side of a vehicle; they could get caught in the tracks, causing death, injury, or damage to the equipment or vehicle. • DO NOT place too many riders on the vehicle. • DO NOT fall asleep when riding. The warm engine may induce drowsiness; a fall could be fatal."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"TC 90-1 5-40 • DO NOT smoke when mounted on a vehicle. • DO NOT stand near a moving or turning vehicle at any time. Tanks have a deceptively short turning radius. Figure 5-16. Danger areas around a tank when firing the 120-mm main gun. b. Additional Considerations. Additional considerations and preparations for transporting infantrymen include the following. (1) The armor: (a) Uses main-gun fire to reduce obstacles or entrenched positions for the infantry. (b) Takes directions from the infantry ground commander (platoon leader/PSG/squad leader) to support their fire and maneuver. (c) Provides reconnaissance by fire for the infantry. (d) Should know and understand how the infantry clears buildings, how they mark cleared buildings, casualty evacuation plan, signal methods, engagement criteria for tank DANGERS 1. The overpressure from the tank 120-mm cannon can kill a dismounted infantryman within a 90-degree arc extending from the muzzle of the gun tube out to 200 meters. 2. From 200 to 1,000 meters along the line of fire, on a frontage of about 400 meters dismounted infantry must be aware of the danger from discarding sabot petals, which can kill or ser iously injure soldiers."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"TC 90-1 5-41 main gun, front line trace reporting, ground co mmunication from the tank with the dismounted Infantry. (e) Uses its night vision capability to augment and supplement the Infantry's night vision capability. (2) The Infantry: (a) Provides real time information for the tank crewmen to help them overcome tank noise and the lack of ground situational understanding. (b) Provides reconnaissance and fire di rection of enemy positions for main gun attack. (3) Considerations for dismounted tank security include the following: (a) Tank crewman should rehearse the m ounting and dismounting of Infantry from their vehicle, briefing the Infantrymen on sa fety procedures for the vehicle and weapon systems. (b) Tank commanders need to rehearse communicating with dismounted soldiers by way of TA-1 and DR-8 in the bustle rack. (4) Vehicle preparation for combat in urban terrain should cover these procedures: (a) Keep at least one ballistic shield to the “Dog House” closed (most engagements will be under boresight range and the battlesight technique will suffice). (b) Place sandbags around antenna connections and electrical wiring on the turret top. (c) Place extra coax ammunition inside the turret. (d) Remove any highly flammable products fr om the outside of the vehicle and from the sponson boxes. c. Vehicles, Weapons, and Munitions. Numerous factors related to vehicles and their organic weapons and munitions affect the tank platoon’s urban operation planning and execution, including the following: (1) The preferred main gun rounds in the urban environment are HEAT, MPAT (ground mode), and MPAT-OR (XM908). These all perform much better than sabot rounds against bunkers and buildings. (2) HEAT ammunition will open a larger hole in reinforced concrete or masonry structures than MPAT or MPAT-OR (XM 908). Both MPAT and MPAT-OR, however, offer greater incapacitation capability inside the structure. (3) HEAT ammunition arms approximately 60 feet from the gun muzzle. It loses most of its effectiveness against urban targets at ranges of less than 60 feet. (4) MPAT and MPAT-OR rounds arm approximate ly 100 feet from the muzzle of the gun. Because of the shape and metal com ponents of the projectiles, however, this ammunition remains effective at ranges of less than 100 feet. (5) Sabot petals, including those on MP AT and MPAT-OR, endanger accompanying infantry elements. They create a hazard area extending 70 meters on either side of the gun-target line out to a range of 1 kilometer. (6) The tank’s main gun can depress only to -10 degrees and can elevate only to +20 degrees. This creates considerable dead space for the crew at the close ranges that are typical in the urban environment. (7) The external M2 HB machine gun can de liver a heavy volume of suppressive fire and penetrate light construction, buildings and most barricades. The M2 HB MG can elevate to +36 degrees; however, the TC must be unbuttoned to fire the M2 on the M1A2 or M1A2 SEP."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"TC 90-1 5-42 (8) The M240 coax machine gun can effectiv ely deliver suppressive fires against enemy personnel and against enemy positions that are behind light cover. (9) The loader’s M240 machine gun can effec tively deliver suppressive fire against enemy personnel and against enemy positions th at are behind light cover; however, the loader must be unbuttoned to operate it. Th is weapon may be dismounted and used in a ground role if units are equipped with the M240 dismount kit. (10) When buttoned up, the tank crew has limite d visibility to the sides and rear and no visibility to the top. Figures 5-17 and 5-18 illust rate the dead space associated with tank operations in an urban environment. (11) FM 3-20.12 (FM 17-12-1-1) explains sp ecial uses for tank-mounted machine guns in the urban environment. Figure 5-17. Tank weapon d ead space at street level. Figure 5-18. Tank main gun and coax dead space above street level. d. Tank Platoon Command and Cont rol in Urban Operations. The following command and control considerations affect the tank platoon’s urban operations planning and execution:"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"TC 90-1 5-43 (1) Communications Problems . The low-level task organization that may take place during urban operations requires elements to establish additional communications links, which can be disrupted by buildings and other urban terrain features. (2) Fire Control . Extensive direct fire planning a nd restrictive fire control measures are an absolute requirement in urban operations. (3) Proximity and Visibility . Friendly elements often must operate in confined and restrictive areas during urban operations, and they may not be able to see other nearby friendly forces. These factors significan tly increase the danger of fratricide. (4) Personnel Factors . Urban operations impose significant, and often extreme, physical and psychological demands on soldiers and leaders. (5) ROE/ROI and Civilians . The ROE and/or ROI may re strict the use of certain weapon systems and TTP. As an integral pa rt of urban operations, noncombatants create special operational problems. To deal with these concerns, units operating in urban terrain must know how to effectively employ linguists and counterintelligence and civil affairs teams. (6) Slow Pace Urban Operations . This operation usually prevents the tank platoon from taking full advantage of the speed and mobility of its tanks."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"TC 90-1 A-1 APPENDIX A TRAINING TIPS The effectiveness of urban operations training programs depends on the imagination and thoroughness applied to a training plan. All trainers, from training managers to junior le aders, should prepare their units to fulfill their urban operations mission. They can employ procedures that are based on training doctrine and pr oven techniques. This appendix discusses several techniques fo r conducting urban operations training. Trainers make the choice based on the training needs and available resources. A-1. CONCURRENT TRAINING Concurrent training allows groups of soldiers to train on different tasks at the same time. This training requires a plan fo r rotating soldiers between the stations that teach different tasks. This procedure is referred to as round-robin training. Conc urrent training is an efficient training technique since it makes th e best use of training time and facilities. Concurrent training in the urban operati ons training facilities works best with performance-oriented tasks. It also requir es detailed planning, cont rol, coordination, and more assistant trainers. Trai ners should use the example training exercise scenarios provided to develop training that meets their units' training needs. a. Urban Assault Course and Breach . These facilities are well suited to conduct concurrent training. After master ing the tasks at one station, a group of soldiers rotates to the next station in the sequence. To avoid bot tlenecks at any of the stations, trainers plan instructional blocks that last about the same length of time. Concurrent training is often conducted with dedicated instru ctors at each station. The advantage of this technique is that it ensures uniformity of performance standards and save s on trainer prep aration time. The disadvantage is that the soldier is not always trained by his leader. Therefore, when feasible, small-unit leaders shoul d rotate with their soldiers from station-to-station so they can take part in the training. This techni que demands much preparation and expertise from leaders. b. Urban Assault Course and Combined Arms Collective Training Facility . These facilities are well suited for conducting concurrent exercises. Concurrent exercises are variants of concurrent tr aining. In a concurrent exercise, elements of the same unit receive different missions. These missions correspond to each element's training objective for that exercise. This technique can be used during FTXs, STXs, or CFXs. For example, one unit attacks; a second unit suppor ts by fire; a third un it acts as a reserve. Also, elements of the same unit can challeng e each other. For example, if a trainer has been training his unit in urban offense and de fense operations, he can create a scenario in which one force is required to attack the othe r. This technique allows the unit to train with an OPFOR without an extra investment of resources. Leaders must remember to carefully plan the force ratios between the OPFOR and counterattacking forces. A-2. DEMONSTRATIONS Trainers may demonstrate the correct way to perform the tasks. A demonstration can include a skit, film, or videotape. A live de monstration is normally an effective teaching"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"TC 90-1 A-2 method since it holds soldiers' interest. Demons trations can be performed at the UAC and the Breach Facility. However, the trainers must demonstrate the task slowly so that the soldiers can see all the step s. They emphasize key points and stop the action to explain each one. The trainers can use video cameras to film the action occurring inside the buildings. Soldiers can watch the demonstra tions on a remote monitor, and trainers can use the videotapes again for later training. A-3. EXERCISES Exercises help train soldiers and leaders to wo rk well together and to use their equipment and resources properly. Table A- 1 below lays out the type of training exercise, and the appropriate training facility. EXERCISE CACTF SHOOT HOUSE SIMULATIONS LOCAL TOWN MAPEX X X X TEWT X X CPX X X X CFX X X BSX X LFX X STX X X X FTX X X Table A-1. Training exercise matrix. a. Map Exercise . A MAPEX allows participants to plan and execute urban operations using maps, overlays, sand tables , photographs, or models. MAPEXs develop teamwork and skills in terrain analysis , planning, coordination, order writing, and employment of urban operation tactics and are more suited for battle staff and leaders. (1) Using a model of the CACTF is an excel lent training aid for instructing soldiers and leaders. Gather leaders around the map or model and have them devise a tactical plan. Use figures or markers to represent fr iendly units and the OPFOR. Create tactical situations that challenge participants to react as they woul d in real combat. (2) Incorporate direct fire, casualties, NBC, logistics, and civilians into the exercise. Ensure the ROE for each exercise is clear to participants. (3) Have plenty of detailed maps availabl e for use in the MAPEX and in the planning and execution of subsequent CFX operations. b. Tactical Exercise Without Troops . A TEWT focuses on leader and staff tasks. The senior trainer selects the terrain for the urban TEWT. Either the CACTF or a real village, town, or city is appropriate. The procedure for conducting a TEWT is as follows: (1) Create a scenario and enemy situation, and assign missions."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"TC 90-1 A-3 (2) Allow the leaders to devise their rec onnaissance plans and implement them on the terrain. (3) Require the leader to brief s ubordinates while walking the terrain. (4) Ensure their plans include the following tasks: • Analyze the terrain. • Employ units according to the terrain analysis. • Emplace weapons. • Devise a unit plan. • Employ combat, CS, and CSS assets. (5) Conduct an AAR. c. Command Post Exercise/Battle Simulation Exercise . These exercises allow leaders and battle staffs to perform thei r tasks in a unit CP, where they receive information in the form of reports that require certain reactions. This type of training can be achieved through the constructive simulatio ns training portion of the urban operations training strategy usi ng JANUS or JCATS. (1) The CPX/BSXs are most effective in achieving the following general training objectives: • Preparing plans. • Issuing orders. • Building teams. • Reconnoitering, selecting, and tactically occ upying CP locations. • Establishing and using communications. • Preparing and sending reports. • Coordinating between subordinate elements. (2) A company CP is usually associated w ith a battalion level or higher CPX, but a company can conduct its own CPX. The hea dquarters section can set up a CP in a CACTF building, displace to another building, a nd repeat the exercise until they meet the required standards. The section can prac tice hiding wire on pa vement, stringing it between buildings, and running it through sewers . The CP can practice receiving reports, posting situation maps, and sending repor ts forward to higher headquarters. d. Command Field Exercise . The CFX is used to trai n commanders, staffs, and junior leaders. The CACTF or a local town can accommodate this type of exercise. However, the unit commander must go thr ough the correct proce dures when conducting training off federal property. The CFX empl oys all of a unit's command and control assets, with a number of subordinate elemen ts reduced according to a set scale. For example, one soldier might represent an en tire squad, one vehicle a platoon, or one gun an entire battery. (1) Preliminary training, such as CPXs , TEWTs, MAPEXs, and BSXs, should precede the CFX. Units conduct operations, and controllers resolve battle outcomes. The exercise ends with an AAR. Fewer controlle rs are needed in a CFX than in an FTX. However, if the number of unit functions increases, the number of controllers must increase also. (2) Combat in urban areas entails centraliz ed planning with decentralized execution. (a) Centralized planning can be practiced in a CFX; however, it can be practiced more efficiently in a CPX, TEWT, MAPEX, or BSX."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"TC 90-1 A-4 (b) Decentralized execution means that pl atoon, squad, and team leaders lead the battle in an urban area. However, because el ement participation is scaled down in a CFX, trainers usually find STXs, FT Xs, and TEWTs more useful. e. Live-Fire Exercise . Chapter 3 and local range regulations provide specific guidance for conducting LFXs at the shoot house. Live-fire training allows soldiers and leaders to maneuver while firing servic e ammunition or SRTA. An LFX is most productive when preceded by non-live-fire prac tice (dry fire or dr y run). However, dry fire should always precede live fire either using TES or SESAM. An AAR should follow each repetition, and units should not proceed to the next level of difficulty until they master the current step. The training in a LFX occurs in the following sequence, which can be shortened if time and ammunition dictate. (1) Dry fire to practice unit drills and individual tasks. (2) Conduct an AAR. (3) Practice drills and tasks a second time with limited expenditure of ammunition to show the complex coordination of fire and maneuver required. (4) Conduct an AAR. (5) Practice the exercise a third time with full use of ammunition to create realism and to build confidence. (6) Conduct an AAR. f. Situational Training Exercise . The STXs are mission-orie nted, limited exercises used to train a unit to perfor m a single collective task or a series of related tasks and drills. With their distinct start and stop po ints, STXs represent a segment of battle. An STX is more flexible and complex than a sing le T&EO or drill. In fact, an STX typically includes drills, leader tasks, and separate individual tasks, and involves a unit's \"slice\" of external combat, CS, and CSS assets. An STX often precedes an FTX or CFX, and can be conducted in the CACTF by creating a brief situation and mission. For example, the MP company commanders might want to teach the soldiers about straggler control. They can string the tasks together into small scenarios such as STXs, describe a tactical situation that produces stragglers from nearby units, us e other soldiers to represent the stragglers, and train soldiers to process stragglers at straggler collection and transport points. g. Field Training Exercise . An FTX allows units to execute collective tasks under conditions that closely rese mble actual urban terrain. The FTXs are suitable for the CACTF. (1) An FTX requires significant time, resour ces, and planning. The time is well spent if units master their collective tasks. An FTX is an excellent way to conduct the run stage of collective training. Addi tionally, OPFOR and MILES gr eatly enhance the training value of the FTX. (2) A unit's urban operation FTX training plan addresses ROE, maneuver restrictions, and the controller plan. Soldie rs must know the exercise's training objectives before they begin so they can focus on the correct tasks. Every participant, re gardless of position or rank, must fully understand all safety requirements. (3) To make maximum use of their training time in the field, leaders must plan in great detail. The concept of multiechelon training demands that they consider what training can occur at each level in each event."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"TC 90-1 A-5 A-4. EVALUATORS Soldiers from the training unit or from another unit can evaluate urban operations training, especially during the r un stage of training in an STX, FTX, or CFX. A dedicated evaluator provides objec tive and thorough comments on the unit's performance throughout all stages of the exer cise. Evaluators monitor the critical point of the action but must avoid interfering. They must not disrupt unit performanc e or undermine realism. They must be trained and given standardized evaluation guides if their feedback is to be meaningful; MTPs and T&EOs are a good star t. Evaluators fac ilitate AARs alone or along with the unit leader. A-5. TACTICAL ENGAGEMENT SYSTEM The TES realistically repl icates the effects of actual fire in training. It uses laser adapters on the weapons and laser-sensitive equipm ent on the soldiers and vehicles. A TES weapon emits a laser beam when fired. Accurate fire strikes the laser-sensitive equipment and scores a hit. The TES re quires soldiers to aim accurately and to use cover and concealment effectively. When used with an OPFOR, TES offers realistic training. It is an excellent training aid for an FTX or STX. It is also effective at the shoot house as a substitute for live fire. The two major shortcom ings of TES are that it allows soldiers to seek cover behind structures that normally w ould not protect them, and that it does not replicate suppression. A-6. NAVIGATION Navigational techniques for urban areas di ffer from those needed on other terrain. a. A typical 1:50,000-scale military map pr ovides insufficient detail for accurate navigation. Therefore, soldiers must learn to navigate using commercial maps, sketches, and aerial photographs. Leaders must learn how to plan operations using these items. b. Underground navigation is a special chal lenge. Soldiers must know subway plans and be able to identify tunnels, elevated track s, stairways, and othe r critical features. They must learn how to measure distance, remain oriented, and mark their routes. c. Destruction often erases urban features that could aid in na vigation. Soldiers must learn to orient using distinctive, difficult-to-erase features such as bridges, waterways, towers, and intersections. d. Leaders conduct navigational exercises in an actual urban area. Soldiers must move from point to point while controllers at each point monitor and verify soldiers' progress. e. The GPS is a navigational aid that triangul ates with satellites to calculate position. However, this system may be affected by nearby tall buildings, and its effectiveness decreases inside buildings or underground. A-7. LIMITED VISIBILITY TRAINING Urban operations involve day and night ope rations. FTXs, STXs, CFXs, and CPXs are the valuable exercise s for night training. a. Field-expedient lighting, NVDs, illumina tion, and electrical lighting must be exploited when the tactical situation allows. Soldiers must learn discipline in their use of light, and also learn the lighting techniques that allow them to carry out their urban training program."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"TC 90-1 A-6 b. Situational awareness is the soldier's knowledge of hi s location, the locations of friendly forces, and the locations of the enem y on the battlefield. Situational awareness is the key to avoiding fratricide, especially during limited vi sibility operations. Units must plan to use all the equipment and devices av ailable to mark friendly units and to avoid fratricide, without exposing themselves to enemy observation. c. Reverse-cycle training should be part of an urban training program. Limited visibility fighting skills ar e perishable, but they can be sustained and improved by effective training. The goal is fo r every soldier to operate as effectively at night as during the day. A-8. SAFETY/AMMUNITION CONSIDERATIONS When using ammunition and pyrotechnics, all associated safety requirements must be adhered to. The following paragraphs describe some of the safety equipment and training procedures to be considered. a. Special Effect Small-Arms Marking System . The SESAMS uses 5.56-mm and 9-mm ammunition that is used for urban tr aining. It requires chan ging the bolt of the M16/M4 family of weapons and the barrel of the M9 pistol. The ammunition has a projectile that bursts on contac t leaving a colored mark that is visible. Colors vary and different colors can be assi gned to OPFORs for engagement identification and fratricide tracking. SESAMS, has a 30-meter effective ra nge and activates TES (MILES). TES and SESAMS should be used together. When using SESAMS all exposed skin must be covered for protection such as gloves and eye protection worn. The projectile can break exposed skin at close ranges. Every precauti on must be taken to protect the head during training with this ammunition. The eyes must be completely encl osed within the eye protection. The standard-Army’s sun, wind, and dust goggles can be us ed to protect the eyes. Hearing protection must be worn to pr event injury. The mouth must remain covered to prevent any injury to the ears. Any time during a training exercise that a soldier loses any of his protective gear, he must immediatel y replace the gear. If the soldier is in an engagement when protective gear is lost, he should immediately c over his face and eyes with his hands and remain in th at position until the engagement ends or is instructed that it is safe to replace his safety equipment. All individuals to incl ude observer/controllers during exercises using SESA MS must wear protection. b. M84 Stun Grenade . The M84 stun grenade is a non- lethal diversionary hand- deployed grenade, which produces an in tense flash and bang. The bang level at 1.5 meters is over 170 dBs. Even though this level does not produc e permanent hearing damage, one-time use soldiers are required to wear hearing protec tion when noise levels are above 85 dBs. Flash level is between 1 to 2.5 million candlepower. The M84 is designed to be a non-lethal grenade that is intended to provide a re liable, effective non- lethal means of neutralizing and disorienti ng enemy personnel and may be used tactically as well as in training. The M84 stun gren ade has an M201A1 fuse and a pyrotechnic output charge in a synthetic casing with a one to two sec ond delay fuse, which cannot be cooked off. The grenade body consists of a non-fragmenting metal hexagonal casing, which resists tendencie s to roll once deployed. c. Smoke Grenades . Smoke grenades are used th roughout urban combat and are employed to cover movement, deceive enem y forces, and for signaling. Smoke should not be used in buildings a nd subterranean passages as it displaces oxygen and protective"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"TC 90-1 A-7 masks do not filter the smoke or provide oxyge n. Buildings in the urban area can affect air current, which influence emplacement; one gr enade should be used to test the air’s flow before employing any more. A-9. OPPOSING FORCES Trainers should include OPFO R in training, especially dur ing FTXs, CFXs, and STXs. OPFOR counter tasks should be developed. Leaders should develop a thorough control plan for scenarios that include an OPFOR. This plan should include uniform and vehicle markings, ammunition, safety instructions, controller guidance, and guidelines for handling prisoners. ROE must clearly specify th e limits of close combat between soldiers. a. Using an OPFOR heightens the soldiers ' interest by giving them a real opponent. This technique fosters unit competition and re alism, especially when the OPFOR is used in addition to TES and SESAM. b. An OPFOR challenges leaders' ability to improvise. However, this free-play scenario should be monitored to ensure the unit meets the training objectives. c. The OPFOR can use threat urban operations doctrine. OPFOR uniforms, mock documents, overlays, and equipment to add realism and intelligence to the scenario. Leaders conduct preliminary training for th e OPFOR, which help s the OPFOR recreate the threat's urban tactics. d. Non-combatants should be inte grated into training scenarios. A-10. PRECISION MARK SMANSHIP TRAINING The UAC, CACTF, and the Shoot Hous e are designed to accommodate target discrimination training. However, precision marksmanship training should be conducted before training at these faci lities, IAW FM 23-9 (3-23.9). Th is sequence ensu res that the unit conducting the training gets the best use of time and resources. A-11. PHYSICAL TRAINING Combat in urban areas places extraordinar y physical demands on soldiers. Therefore, physical training with emphasis on upper body de velopment is paramount to any urban operations training program. A-12. VARIED SCENARIOS Leaders must use varied training scenarios to prevent redundant a nd predictable tactical behavior. Using predictable avenues of approa ch into the facility produces stereotypical tactical solutions. A-13. BUILDING FAÇADE WALLS, WINDOWS AND DOORS The use of façade walls, windows and doors, in conjunction with SESAMS in the interior of some stations at the UAC, provides for mo re realistic training. This method of training reinforces the fact that walls, windows, and doors in most cases DO NOT stop the penetration of service ammun ition. Plastic wrap sheeting, tarp aper, or some other type of material can be used to allow SESAMS penetration (Figure A-1, page A-8)."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"TC 90-1 A-8 Figure A-1. Shoot through walls and doors. A-14. USE OF OLDER OR NONSTANDARD FACILITIES Some installations may not receive the UAC, SH, BF, and CACTF for some time until the necessary funding is alloca ted to construct the facilitie s. The older MOUT Assault Course (MAC) and Collective Training Facility (CTF) described in TC 90-1 can be used as substitute facilities along w ith nonstandard shoot houses. It can also be used with other nonstandard urban facilities to implement the training strategies outlined in this TC. Specific training tips for adaptation to these facilities are described in this paragraph. a. Urban Assault Course . Generally, the MAC can be used to train the majority of tasks that would be trained in the UAC. The MAC will not have any targetry and instrumentation. Units can use portable vide o cameras for video capture and VCRs and television sets for video play back to facilitate an AAR. Ta rgets can be OPFOR NOTE : Framework is covered with Black plastic sheeting, tarpaper, or other SESAMS penetrable material. WINDOW DOOR Modular Wall System"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"TC 90-1 A-9 with MILES. Role players in civilian clot hes can be introduced to play the part of noncombatants. b. Shoot House . Many nonstandard shoot houses, fo r example, tire houses, exist in different installations. Local range regulati ons and unit risk analyses will govern their use. Again, units can use portable video cameras for video capture and VCRs and television sets for video play back to facilitate an AAR . Both precision and nonprecision targets can be fabricated using E-type si lhouettes on a stake, old BDUs/civilian clothes filled with straw, and so forth. Simulate nonc ombatants with E-type silhouettes painted white or dummies in civilian clothes. Pla ce balloons in the head and upper torso area to simulate lethal shot placement. Where loca l policy permits, convert portions of collective training facilities into live-fi re shoot houses using SRTA. c. Breach Facility . Existing demolition ranges may be used to conduct explosive breaching provided door, window, and wall units, or facsimiles, are available. Mechanical breaching can be practiced in ol der areas of the installation designated for demolition, if such facilities are available. In all cases, units must ensure that local safety policies are met. d. Combined Arms Collective Training Facility . Generally the older CTF can be used to train the majority of tasks that w ould be trained in the CACTF. The CTF will not have any targetry and instrumentation. Agai n, units can use portable video cameras for video capture and VCRs and television sets fo r video play back to facilitate an AAR. Targets can be OPFOR with MILES. Role play ers in civilian clothes can be introduced to play the part of noncombatants. If armored ve hicles will be used, units should ensure that local range policies allow for their use. Older CTFs are normally either a 16 or 32 building design. Appropriate unit-level tr aining, platoon, company, or battalion, should be planned based on the size of the facility. CAUTION Units should ensure that they are in compliance with all lo cal policies affecting live fire before attempti ng to use SRTA in an older collective traini ng facility or non- standard urban training site."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"TC 90-1 B-1 APPENDIX B UNIT TRAINING MATRIX Unit training plans are prepared IAW FM 25-101, which states that \"Planning links the unit METL and the execution of battle-focused training.\" The commander begins hi s planning with guidance from a higher echelon and an in-depth assessmen t of METL tasks (in this case, mission-essential urban tasks). Base d on his own observations, feedback from his subordinates, and other sources the commander determines which tasks should be trained, which shoul d be trained first, and how much time should be allotted for each.

E-1. FUTURE SIMULATIONS TRAINING Commanders train their staffs to plan, coor dinate, and synchronize their units’ operations from initial mobilization and deployment. These operations include the full spectrum of Army operations; offense, defense, stab ility, and support. Current simulations lack adequate replication of urban scenarios, te rrain, and weapons effects. The introduction of WARSIM 2000 and OneSAF should help to solve these simulations modeling deficiencies. a. For lower echelon units, battalion and below, constructive simulations (JANUS) complement collective battle staff training that occurs during virtual simulation similar to the close combat tactical trainer and live events. For echelons above battalion, it becomes difficult to use simulators or live maneuver to train. Studies to date indicate the crossover point for simulation versus simulator is at the battalion level. Some training events from battalion and below can be trained effectivel y using various types of simulators. Above battalion level, effective training almost has to be conducted with a simulation (Figure E-1). Figure E-1. Echelons and uses. b. Simulations that support leader and battle staff training focus on collective tasks rather than individual leader tasks. Simulati ons, used in this context, rely on the human dynamics in the command setting and use real-tim e actions in a tactical environment with a unit's go-to-war systems.

Battle staff training encourages team building, task coordinati on, and standardization of staff actions. (1) Constructive simulations can provide commanders large areas for conducting training, access to sensitive areas through computer and mapping technology, and futuristically provide a much better level of fidelity in terms of urban operations terrain and scenario replication. (2) Simulations can portray large, capable , and doctrinally correct OPFORs. All of the soldiers portrayed in the units in a simu lation do not have to be present in order for the training to be realistic. An attractive f eature of simulations has always been the reduced staffing necessary to conduct this type of training exercise. (3) Simulations can stress CPs and provi de the realistic conditions under which commanders must make decisions. Brigade and below simulation (BBS) and corp battle simulation (CBS) are well known for the st ressful environments created during an exercise. The stress is realistic and can assi st in conditioning the training audience before CTC rotations. (4) Simulations allow different units to train under the same conditions and to the same standards. This technique is a unique feature of simulations as the exact weather, opposing force organization, location of units, and equipment can be used to train many different units on the same terrain with the same conditions. (5) The size and number of personnel in a battle staff vary depending on the echelon and other demands unique to that commander.

The major development efforts for FAMSIM is WARSIM 2000. WARSIM 2000, in conjunction with OneSAF, exploits new t echnologies to enable commanders and staffs at battalion through EAC to train in a realis tic simulation environment (Figure E-3). The increased realism of WARSIM 2000 over existing models allows units to use ABCS systems to synchronize across the complete range of operations. WARSIM 2000's design allows warfighting CPs to use organic ABCS equipment to interact with the simulation from training sites in the field, as well as from simulation centers. WARSIM 2000 will also be capable of depicting a joint and combined environment across the operational continuum. Figure E-3. Urban operations simulations crosswalk. d.

REALISTIC TRAINING OFF FEDERAL FACILITIES Realistic training for urban operations is critical to force readiness. Training opportunities that are both realistic and cha llenging may not be available at federal installations or other facilities specifically established for the conduct of urban operations training. Training in off post civilian urban settings may become necessary in order to support readiness and training requirements. To accommodate both military training need s and the unique concerns of civilian communities in which realistic urban tr aining events are proposed, the following Department of Defense uniform procedures have been established for planning and approval of training activities in civilian urban settings: =============================================================== = UNIFORM PROCEDURES FOR PLANNING AND APPROVING REALISTIC URBAN TRAINING 1. REFRENCES . a. Secretary of Defense Memorandum, (dat e), Department of Defense Policy for Realistic Urban Training off Federal Facilities. b. 10 USC § 167, Unified Combatant Command for Special Operations Forces. c . 10 USC §§ 3013, 5013, 8013. d. Department of Defense Directive 5111.10. e. Unified Command Plan 99. 2. PURPOSE . This enclosure establishes uniform planning and approval procedures for realistic urban training (RUT) events conducte d in civilian urban settings in the United States, its territories and possessions. 3. APPLICABILITY . This procedure applies to all RUT events in civilian urban settings conducted in the United States, its territories and possessions, by Active or"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"TC 90-1 E-9 Reserve Forces, including National Guard Forces in Federal service. This policy does not apply to National Guard Forces while in State status (under title 32) or to aviation operations that do not require an exemption from standard Federal Aviation Regulations. 4. DEFINITIONS . For the purposes of this enclos ure, the following definitions are applied: a. Military Operations on Urban Terrain . MOUT is all military actions planned and conducted on a topographical complex and its adjacent natural terrain where man- made construction is the dominant feature. It includes combat-in-cities, which is that portion of MOUT involving house-to-house and street-by-street fighting in towns and cities. b. Realistic Urban Training . RUT is high-intensity, cl ose-quarter battle training and the use of live or non-lethal fires, demo litions/explosives (for example, breaching), and air and naval supporting platforms at the objective in civilian urban settings. It includes MOUT training that equals the definition of realistic urban training, c. Civilian Urban Setting . A civilian urban setting is an area or areas located in or near a civilian community. This proposed r ealistic urban training event should not be located on federal, installations, state, local, or private facilities. These settings should not be developed or established for the pur pose of training events especially where training activities are not expected to have an effect on civilian residences or commercial areas because of noise, traffic, or other foreseeable effects of the training activity. 5. PROCEDURES . The following procedures apply to the planning and approval of RUT in civilian urban settings. a. It is the responsibility of the combat ant commander or the service to ensure compliance with these procedures and the in tent of the policy established by reference. Approval authority for RUT events may be dele gated to a general or flag officer within the chain of command of the combatant command or service conducting the training. b. Proposed training events are reviewed to determine whether they are necessary and appropriate for unit readiness. Training must support unit METs and JMETs. c. Upon approval of the proposed training a nd not later than 14 days before the commencement of training, the combatant command or service notifies the SECR)PF through the CJCS (by way of message) of the approved training, At a minimum this notice will include the following: (1) Name and location of the unit conducting training. (2) A description of the scope of the, tr aining and types of activities to be conducted during the training event (for example, live fire, breaching, use of aircraft)."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"TC 90-1 E-10 (3) Start and end dates of the training. (4) Training location. (5) A statement that all necessary c oordination has been accomplished IAW the procedures outlined below listing the names a nd positions of each official contacted IAW subparagraph d below. d. Coordination with civilian officials. (1) During the planning phase for the trai ning event, the commander responsible for planning the training must coordinate with and obtain approval for the event from the appropriate federal, state, and local civilian authorities. Civil officials shall approve in writing. Commanders shall consult their legal and public affairs officers to assist in determining the appropriate civilian officials with whom to coordinate the training event. In determining the appropriate civilian officials for coordination, local government officials (for example, mayor, borough chief, county commissioners or supervisors), and local and Federal law enforcement agencies ar e consulted. At a minimum, a senior level official with responsibility for each affected civilian urban settings is consulted. (2) Issues to be addressed with civilian officials, during coordination, shall include details on specific proposed training activities (such as whether the event involves live fire, the use of rotary- or fixed-wing aircra ft, close quarters battle training, whether the exercises are to be conducted in daylight or at night, and so forth.), precautions to ensure public and participant safety, proposed public or resident notification/outreach procedures, and any other issues that might re sult in public interest or concern regarding the conduct of the exercise. (3) To the maximum extent possible civilian officials are to be briefed in person on the exercise concept. (4) The US congressional representative, or his/her staff, in whose district the training is taking place, and the US senators fo r the state, or their staffs, are advised of the proposed training event and provided info rmation to the extent requested. Written approval or concurrence from the represen tative or senators is not a precondition to exercise execution. However, if objections or issues by the representative or senators are raised and cannot be resolved, the issues are immediately elevated to the Joint Staff, J3, and the service or combatant commander point of contact. (5) For each training site, license agreemen ts with civilian or government property owners or managers are executed. Agreemen ts address liability and conditions on usage of property. Property owners are informed of the nature of the training to include written notification whether the activities will include Breaching charges (amount of explosive), live ammunition (type: for example, shotgun, fra ngible, and so forth.), rotary or fixed- wing aircraft, and whether the exercises will be conducted in daylight or at night. Before execution, license agreements must be review ed for legal sufficiency. Copies of the"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"TC 90-1 E-11 license agreements shall be provided to the senior civilian officials responsible for the affected civilian urban settings. (6) A record of coordination activities is maintained for each training event. The record includes the names and positions of the officials that coordinate and approve the event. It also includes a summary of the info rmation for the officials regarding the event (for example, date, time, and location of th e training; types of activities to be conducted; proposed public notification/outreach plan s, and so forth.). A follow-on letter is distributed to the senior civilian officials responsible for the affected civilian urban settings that confirms the training event and lists the names of the civilian officials that the plans for the training event. (7) Training events that will be conducted on a recurring basis at the same area or location may be based on a single MOA with the appropriate authorizing civilian officials. The terms of the MOA must comply with the requirements of this attachment. The MOA, which authorizes the recurring tr aining, is reviewed by the service or the combatant commander to ensure it complies with the procedures. Once the MOA is approved, individual training events conducte d pursuant to the MOA can be conducted without further Joint Staff or OSD revi ew. However, services and combatant commanders ensure that SO/LIC and the Joint Staff are notified 14 days in advance of the training events conducted pursuant to such MOA. Services and combatant commanders must ensure that such MOAs are periodically reviewed to ensure they continue to fulfill the intent. (8) If nondisclosure agreements are required, they are reviewed by command legal representatives. Nondisclosure statements s hould clearly explain that the agreement does not preclude persons from informing others of general, nonsensitive information about the training exercise. (9) To the extent practicable, consistent with OPSEC and safety considerations, recommendations of civilian officials rega rding community notification/outreach and press procedures will be followed. Commun ity notification/outreach procedures may include door-to-door notification conducted by the local law enforcement agency. Where notification/outreach and press r ecommendations cannot be followed, civilian officials will be so advised. e. Other instructions include: (1) Legal and PA representatives are present for final planning meetings and on-site for the duration of all training activities. (2) The on-site PAO handles all press queries after coordinating with the on-scene commander. (3) All requested training must be in accordance with all applicable statutes, law, DOD directives and other guidance, and implementing service directives."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"TC 90-1
