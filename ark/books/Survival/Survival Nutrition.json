[{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"W elcome to Survival Nutrition. I’ll be your host, Mike Adams. I’m the author of Food Forensics and the owner of an ISO accredited forensic food laboratory. This course is all about how to use nutrition to stay alive as we experience this global reset, perhaps civil war -- definitely riots in the streets -- and all these crazy things that are happening right now. This is being recorded in September of 2020. If you’re hearing this on a video website somewhere, feel free to download the entire audiobook for free at SurvivalNutrition.com . Also, I’ve got two other websites that may be of interest to you. I’ve published another nine-hour audiobook called the Global Reset Survival Guide. A free download of the entire audiobook is available at GlobalReset.news, plus a PDF transcript. A PDF transcript is also available for this course, Survival Nutrition, and you can get that download for free at SurvivalNutrition.com , if you don’t already have it. Finally, I have another website called PrepWithMike.com . Prep is short for preparedness, or prepare. PrepWithMike.com brings you videos, how- to videos, especially about firearms, survival gear, demonstrations and solutions to help you stay alive during this very difficult time. Most people know me as the Health Ranger, and my focus has been on health, nutrition, foods and superfoods for over 20 years now. With this course, Survival Nutrition, I’m finally getting a chance to put this to use in a way that can help people survive what’s coming, which includes extreme food shortages. Let’s just start out right up front here. What is this all about? What is Survival Nutrition? It’s a lot more than just food preparedness. Everybody knows to store some food. By the way, a lot of the food that people are storing is really toxic food, which we’ll talk about I think in chapter three or four. This is about more than food. This is about how to strategically use certain foods, nutrients, remedies and even food-related chemicals and herbs to stay alive during a collapse or domestic war, a grid-down scenario. We’re talking about extended periods of collapse. This isn’t just about how to survive a three- day outage due to a hurricane, or how to survive a tornado, or how to survive a cold spell in the winter. This is about how to survive the collapse of society -- at least some temporary collapse, perhaps lasting months, but potentially even years. It turns out that in a collapse, your need for nutrition goes up. This is the key point that underlies this entire course. Every day, you see most people don’t eat very well in terms of food and nutrition. They eat a lot of fast food, a lot of processed food, and they get by okay, because frankly, they’re not working that hard physically. Most people don’t have very physical jobs. People who do have to eat a lot more food, but that food’s not always Chapter One SURVIVAL NUTRITION NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 2"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"good for them either. They suffer chronic health conditions. But most people in society today eat relatively little compared to what they would have to eat in a survival scenario. Why is that? Because in a survival scenario, guess what? You’ll be doing a lot of things by hand. You may have to wash your clothes on a washboard with a plunger in a bucket of water and soap. You might have to make your own soap. Have you ever done that? It’s labor-intensive. You might have to grow your own food, which is very labor-intensive. Most people don’t know much about gardening or food production. In fact, they know so little that they will starve to death while gardening. They’ll expend more effort trying to grow food than they’ll get back from it because they’re growing all the wrong things. You can starve to death while growing celery and parsley, for example. You have to grow other foods that have a very high caloric return, such as tubers, potatoes and things like that. We’ll talk about that in this course. It’s also about additional stresses that happen to you in a survival scenario, where you may be under physical and mental stress. You may be awake all night because you’re running a patrol for your community, or you’ve been under attack by roving bands of rioters or looters or something. You may not get good sleep. You might suffer a lot from sleep deprivation. You may be wounded. How are you going to heal your wounds? How are you going to handle an infection without the hospital and the antibiotics and all those other things that people have grown used to in modern society? In this course, Survival Nutrition, I’ll teach you nutritional solutions for all these things. There’s another aspect of this that’s really important: cognitive support. Because in a survival scenario, you need to be able to think clearly. You need to be alert mentally, because dangers could lurk at every corner. There could be someone stealing from you as you’re trying to buy groceries or other goods at some kind of a barter location set up by your local town or city. People may be trying to attack you. They may be trying to kill you. On the cognition side of things, you need to be able to make very good decisions on a day-to-day basis. Because they’re poisoned by toxic food ingredients and medications, most people don’t make good cognitive decisions, and that’s just every day in society. People are horrible decision-makers. In good times when you’re not in a survival scenario, making bad decisions doesn’t necessarily cost you your life. But in a collapse, in an SHTF scenario, when it all hits the fan, a bad decision can get you killed. Brain support and cognitive function is key to this, and we’re going to cover that in this course as well. It’s everything, from natural antibiotics and first aid to nourishment and nutrition; PrepWithMike.com NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 3"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"how to produce high-calorie foods that are also healthy; how to choose the right nutrients; how to choose the right foods for storage; and how to store them properly, so that you don’t have them ruined by rodents and pests, or by oxidation and so on. There are many things we’re going to cover in this course that will help you survive. A lot of things that I think will surprise you, because many of the most important things are very simple, but people tend to not think about them. A lot of people store large amounts of food and large amounts of toilet paper, and it’s really not surprising if you read the ingredients on the food they’re storing. Those are foods that cause a lot of diarrhea and have bad digestive effects. Suddenly it makes sense why they have a shopping cart full of toilet paper at the local Costco. Maybe they know more than we think they do. They’re planning ahead because they’ve stored a bunch of horrible foods. I’ll show you in this course how to store very inexpensive food that will keep you alive. A lot of this is learned from experience. I’ve been to many places around the world. I’ve lived in many other countries. I lived in South America for two years, and I spoke nearly fluent Spanish at the time. I lived in Taiwan; I speak Mandarin Chinese at a basic level now. I’ve been to Europe and Australia and Hong Kong and China and Singapore and Peru. I’ve hiked the Andes mountains up to Machu Picchu. In all these places, I’ve observed what low-tech, low-income people usually do for their own stored food. I’ve observed the high elevation sweet potato farmers in Peru that are essentially plowing fields with the beasts of burden, like a giant ox with a wooden plow, and what we call the Indian people in a high elevation Peru, you know, with the -- I don’t know what to call the hats. They’re kind of like black hats. And those people have very colorful sweaters and vests and so on. They have a very unique style of dress, and they’re out there working the farm fields. I’ve been there in person because I’ve done those hikes myself up to high elevations, where I was out of breath as well, even though I was in pretty good shape at the time. But the local people there, they’re built for that high elevation exertion. They taught me a lot of things. There’s a lot of observations. For example, if you’re hiking through the Andes mountains, what do you bring for food? What’s very easy to turn into food? They brought quinoa, eggs and salt. With those three ingredients, you just catch water in a mountain stream, and then you build a small campfire. You boil the water, you put the quinoa in it and it expands tremendously. Add the eggs -- kind of like egg drop soup -- then throw in some salt and you’ve got a very delicious, high-protein food that can keep you going as you’re hiking up the mountains. It doesn’t take a lot of effort to carry that around because quinoa is very, very light. When it absorbs water, it expands tremendously, much more than rice. If you don’t carry water with you, you can still get water from the stream. That’s how you hike around the Andes mountains and stay well-fed while you’re burning 5,000 calories a day, maybe more. We’ll cover these kinds of things. I’ll bring you a lot of benefits of experience and mistakes that I’ve made, as well as lessons that I’ve learned all over the world. When I lived in Ecuador at that time, I was growing about 70% of my entire diet. I had a food forest in Ecuador where I grew tropical fruits, everything from mangoes and papaya to cherimoya and many other things. We had a yucca root plant, so we made yucca soup all the time. Maybe a little too much, had way too much yucca soup in my lifetime already. Yucca is easy to grow – I guess in English you would pronounce it “yuca,” but I’m used to calling it yucca because that’s the Spanish pronunciation of it. Yucca is easy to grow, and many things that can produce fruits quickly are very easy to grow. Depending on your climate, you might not need to wait eight years for a pear tree or a pecan tree to start producing fruit. You can have fruit in one year with a fig tree. A kumquat tree can produce kumquat fruits, which are a natural source of vitamin C. There are also anti-cancer nutrients in kumquat peels, which are edible. Kumquat trees can produce fruit in one year. There are things that you can do now, even if you feel like you’re late to the game. You could go buy a one-foot-tall fig tree and you can plant it, and in the right climate, that can be a 10-foot-tall tree in one year, producing loads of figs. NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 4"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Then you can learn how to dry the fig, if you don’t already know. You can have dried figs, which are a great source of calories and obviously sugars and sweetness. You can combine that with things like, believe it or not, a dried meat or bacon or jerky. You can have -- I think it’s even a delicacy in some restaurants – bacon-wrapped figs. It’s a combination of fat and sweetness and richness, as well as lots of minerals. But you can also get endurance from the protein in the meat and the fat in the bacon. If you’re not a meat eater, there are going to be plenty of things here that are vegan or vegetarian. This is not at all about eating a lot of meat. In fact, most of this probably isn’t about meat, and where appropriate, I’ll mention it. That’s the quick overview of what you’re going to learn in this course. Now what I’m going to get to next here are the three problems that most people have when it comes to nutrition and survival. First, let me just share a little bit of background in case you don’t know who I am and what my experiences are. As I mentioned up front, I am the author of Food Forensics, which was at one point, the number one best-selling science book on Amazon.com . I’m the owner of CWC labs, which is an ISO accredited mass spectrometry laboratory for food forensic analysis and food testing. I’m the founder and owner of HealthRangerStore.com , which is an online retailer of foods, superfoods, certified organic storable foods, essential oils and many other things. What’s unique about us is that we lab test everything that we sell. We quarantine all the raw materials as they come into our warehouse in central Texas. We sample everything, take it to our lab and run heavy metals testing. We run glyphosate testing. We run microbiology tests, including E. coli and salmonella, and a total plate count for yeast and mold. Then for other types of foods, depending on the food or supplement, we run additional tests. For milk, for example, or dried milk products, we run the bovine growth hormone tests. For spirulina, we run radiation tests, just to make sure there’s no latent radiation in it and things like that. We do this very comprehensive laboratory testing and almost everything we sell is certified organic. We don’t sell anything that’s genetically modified. We don’t use any artificial substances, like fragrances, preservatives, food coloring or any of that garbage, even in our laundry detergent product, dishwashing detergent product and body soap. I think we have a toothpaste coming out soon as well. These are very meticulously crafted to be completely free of artificial chemicals, synthetics, pesticides and heavy metals. That’s what we’re known for. Doing this over the years, I started a laboratory -- I think it was in 2013. In fact, when I started the lab, we had to purchase ultimately what became millions of dollars’ worth of laboratory testing equipment, like a mass spectrometry equipment. We’ve got, for example, what’s called a triple quad mass spec, which does organic chemistry and pesticide testing and quantitative analysis. I can tell you if there’s one part per billion of glyphosate in your beer, for example. That’s how sensitive it is. I can detect one part per billion of lead or mercury in your rice protein from China, which is usually very contaminated, by the way. We can find arsenic in seafood products, which is very common, or glyphosate in lentils and oats, and lead in turmeric root powder, which are also very common. Over the years, I’ve had to be trained on all of these instruments. I’ve had to learn quite a lot about organic chemistry and also inorganic chemistry, which is an elemental analysis. We’ve seen thousands of thousands of samples of foods because we are buying foods and we’re selling foods. We’re buying them sometimes 50,000 pounds at a time, with big rigs coming into our warehouse in central Texas and unloading pallets and pallets of food ingredients -- HealthRangerStore.com/SurvivalCans NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 5"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"everything from black beans to oats, quinoa and rice, all kinds of things. Because of this experience, I’ve had a unique view of the food industry: what’s clean and what’s polluted, what the supply lines are like, and some of the games that food raw material providers play with people like us. They try to deceive companies with fake credentials, fake certificates, fake organic certifications and so on. I’ve gained some very unique experience that I’ll share with you here, about how to get honest foods, superfoods and supplements, how to make sure they’re clean and how to store them and use them in a survival scenario. It’s not very common to find scientists like myself. I’m a published food scientist who is also a survivalist, so to speak, or a prepper; that’s what I am. That experience is what I’m going to share with you in this course. Now, just adding this thought in the context of who I am and my science background: When it comes to food forensics, I’m always searching for the truth about what’s in food. I’ve promoted organics over the years. I’ve tried to teach people to avoid pesticides, which are neurotoxic, by the way, and to avoid GMOs and heavy metals and so on. This endeavor has not made me popular with anybody, certainly not the pesticide manufacturers, and also not the storable foods industry, which relies almost exclusively on genetically modified, partially hydrogenated soybean oil and derivative products from GMO corn and so on. There’s something about our society today where truth-tellers are vilified and liars are celebrated. People out there lie to the world and say, “Oh, we’ve got the most amazing food. It’s dirt cheap, but it’s perfectly good. It’s all non- GMO and it’s got a shelf life of 25 years.” That company is going to get a lot of business because they’re lying to people. Their foods are actually GMO and the shelf life of their products is probably only two years, not 25 years. But since there’s very little regulatory enforcement of those claims, they get away with it, and they get a lot of business and can just lie to people. Most people don’t read the ingredients list. Then someone like me comes along and does the testing and all and says, “Oh, wow, there’s a lot of glyphosate in there, or your rice has arsenic in it. Your lentils are contaminated with glyphosate and so on.” And you know what? People don’t like to hear that. It’s very rare to find somebody in the world who does. This is even true in politics. I mean, there’s no one running for president that stands up there and says, “Hey, by the way, America’s broke and we printed way too much money. The dollar is going to at some point and all the savings that you have in dollars will soon be worthless. Right? Okay, vote for me!”. That never happens, because it’s not a popular message. In many cases, people like to be lied to by charlatans, political charlatans or storable foods industry charlatans, or, I guess, in some cases, survival industry charlatans, or whatever. I mean, people really do demand to be lied to because it’s easier for them to handle the deceptions rather than the truths of the world. Because truths are very inconvenient. Truths are difficult. It’s hard to shop for clean food. It’s hard to buy organic all the time. It’s hard to get it right on every front. It’s hard to navigate political claims and decide who’s telling the truth and who isn’t. These things are difficult. But I’ve made it my mission to discover the truth using instruments of science in many cases, then to publish that truth on my main website, NaturalNews.com , which is, of course, viciously attacked by the genetically modified seed producers and the pesticide producers, and so on. But that just kind of goes with the territory. What you’re getting here is a very rare observation about healthy foods and honest foods. I don’t think there’s anyone else in the NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"world who does what I do in terms of being both a prepper and a food scientist, and also a firearms expert, having gone through 5,000 hours of firearms training over the years, which I’ve covered in the other course, the Global Reset Survival Guide. There really aren’t very many people like this, and certainly none of them want to go public and talk about what they know, because a lot of the things that I talk about are not politically correct. For example, saying that most storable food is genetically modified, processed junk food that has lower quality than typical prison food. That’s not a statement that wins you friends in the food industry. Most of what’s going on out there in the industry is an effort to get people to shut up and not talk about the dirty little secrets of survival food or food storage, or what’s really in these herbs -- most of which are from China, in many cases. You wouldn’t believe how much food, supplements and herbs come from China. For example, here’s a little tidbit: A lot of companies that are retailing supplements to a US audience, they say that their supplements are made in the USA. That’s what’s on their bottle: “Made in the USA.” Guess where the ingredients come from. Oh, communist China. And they are heavily polluted with toxic heavy metals. In fact, we currently reject about 80% of the lots of food raw materials that we test, and it’s even higher, maybe 90%, or maybe even more. If we ever look at something from China -- which we rarely do -- sometimes we get materials that a reseller wants us to look at. They’re almost always heavily polluted. But these supplement companies, they’ll buy toxic materials from China dirt cheap, loaded with lead, arsenic and cadmium. Then they’ll have an encapsulation contractor in the United States that makes the product in the USA, which means encapsulating it. They’ll add a flow agent, typically what’s called MCC, or microcrystalline cellulose – it’s just a white powder, basically wood pulp that’s dried. They’ll add that as a flow agent. Then they’ll encapsulate the cheap Chinese herbs into capsules in the USA and sell them at Whole Foods or wherever, and on the bottle, it’ll say Made in the USA. The average customer thinks that that means the ingredients in the bottle came from the USA. They think, “Oh my gosh, this must be U.S. farmers. This must be really clean food” because the U.S. has environmental regulations and farming regulations, and so on. Made in the USA must be good. No. It’s cheap Chinese crap, heavily contaminated with toxic substances, that’s just encapsulated in the USA. It’s all deception, you see, and I’ve probably got a hundred stories like this to tell you that are all true and that would all blow your mind. HealthRangerStore.com/SurvivalBucket NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"For example, I don’t know if you know this, but USDA organic certification does not encompass heavy metals, so you can have a USDA certified organic product, anything wheat, corn, sugar beets, whatever. It can be totally contaminated with lead, but it can still be certified organic. The grower never has to test it for lead to receive the organic certification. Why is that? Because the USDA just doesn’t have the scope of heavy metals as part of its certified organic program. You know why? Because the USDA organic program is run by powerful food corporations that have lots of dirty little secrets, such as heavy metals contamination. You know why that is? You know why are the farms contaminated with heavy metals in America? Because everywhere across the country, people flush toilets with their poo in it. I’ll keep this polite, all of that human feces goes down the sewage system, and it gets collected in the sewage treatment plants, where it’s called biosolids. They dry the biosolids out a little bit, and then they load this material into trucks to get rid of it. They go out to farmers outside the cities, in the rural areas. They say, “Hey, Mr. Farmer, would you like free fertilizer? We have a high-nitrogen biosolids product we’ll give you for free, if you will let us just spread it on your farm.” The farmers who don’t do their research on this because they’re busy growing food, they’ll say, “Well, yes, we’ll take your free fertilizer with nitrogen in it.” The city people go, “Great!” Then they load up trucks with human sewage and they spread it on the farms. These are the farms where the cows feed. These are the farms that grow your almond orchards in California, or pear orchards in Washington state, or apple orchards – fruits, nuts and even vegetables all across the West Coast. It’s really everywhere across America, but that’s sort of the food center of America, the Central Valley of California. It’s all irrigated with sewage water, and it’s fertilized with human sewage. Guess what people flushed down the toilet? Not just their poo. They flush all kinds of other things down there – not to get gross but, you know, condoms and tampons and such. These end up on the farm fields. It’s very common. Any agricultural worker in California will tell you, when they’re going through the field and they’re planting or weeding or whatever, it’s not uncommon to find all of these crazy things that people flush down the toilet. Also, they get light industrial waste from the light industry businesses, such as car mechanic shops and dental offices, and so on. Guess what they’re flushing down the drain? Mercury from mercury fillings, and they’re flushing lead down the drain. They’re flushing arsenic and cadmium. All of that gets concentrated in what I call “biosludge.” Then the biosludge gets spread on the farms. Then the farms produce the food that people are eating, not knowing what’s in it. This happens all across America. In fact, I’ve interviewed numerous experts on this, including an EPA whistleblower, who was fired for doing research on this. That documentary is available for free: It’s called “Biosludged,” and you can download it or watch it at Biosludged.com . It’s just an incredible true story about the toxins that go into the food supply. Most people have no idea that this is happening. If you’re still listening, here we are 30 minutes into the intro, you’re still listening. I’m willing to bet that you’ve already heard three or four things that just totally shocked you, things that you never knew were true. Like, you thought maybe certified organic means clean food, but it doesn’t at all. You thought made in America supplements include ingredients that are grown in America, but no, they don’t. They’re all stuff grown in China. You probably didn’t know that human sewage has spread on farms and goes right back into the food supply, right? Let me hit you with one more thing. I’m not trying to gross you out here. Suppress the gag factor on this. Washington State has legalized the liquefaction of dead human bodies to be put down to the drain. It’s perfectly legal, and it’s a new way to dispose of the dead. They liquefy the dead and then put them down to the municipal sewer system with chemicals. Then that goes into the biosludge that gets spread onto the farms in Washington State, which is where your apples, pears, nuts and vegetables come from as well. They’re literally liquefying the dead and feeding them to the living, which is a line right out of The Matrix, which, at one time, was believed to be a science fiction movie. Now it’s actually a law in the State of Washington. Yes, you can look it up, it’s true. NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"This is some of what you need to know. If you’re going to prepare food for survival, you need to know what’s in your food. You need to know where it’s coming from. You need to know how to get clean food and how to store it. Also, you need to know how to navigate all of the lies of the food industry, which is steeped in all kinds of deception – as is every industry, be it pharmaceuticals, vaccines, pesticides, weapons of war, whatever. It seems like every industry is full of corruption, right? But so is the food industry. There’s no exception to that in the food industry. You’re going to learn a lot in this course, and I will have many more interesting tidbits to share with you. Let’s move on now to the problems that most people have when it comes to nutrition and foods in the context of a survival scenario. The first problem that most people have is they fail to prepare. They don’t even make an effort, much less listen to this course and become an expert about foods, herbs, survival and preparedness, and so on. They don’t even have an extra box of Kraft macaroni and cheese, which I don’t even consider to be food anyway. They don’t even have that. I mean, their cupboard is so thin. They can’t survive a weekend without going to the store to buy more things. Some people just eat at restaurants all the time, or at least they used to, before COVID-19 lockdowns closed most of the restaurants. People are living kind of hand to mouth, literally, in this case, with their meals. They don’t typically practice long- term storage. They don’t understand the basics of food rotation, which is eat what you store, store what you eat and eat your oldest stored food first, so that you’re always constantly rotating your food stores. That’s obviously a basic rule of food storing. You probably already know that. I’m not even going to bother mentioning it again because it’s kind of self-evident, but people don’t even have that. So, they fail to prepare. Then, of course, they panic when things go wrong. “Oh, the grocery stores are empty!” This happened during the COVID lockdowns in certain parts of the country and around the world. Grocery store shelves were empty because of the food shortages and the meat plants getting shut down. Millions of Americans couldn’t buy their pork ribs or something. They were totally freaking out because they didn’t have stored quinoa to live on. The second mistake that most people make is they stock up on the wrong things, things that don’t have shelf life, and they failed to properly store them. When the average sort of clueless, oblivious American stocks up on food, and when I say American here, I also mean you, Canadians, too, because I mean North Americans, okay? You’re on the same boat. A lot of Canadians as well, they stock up on the wrong things. Americans will go to the grocery store, and they will buy Pop-Tarts. “Oh my gosh, there’s going to be a storm? Better get extra Pop- Tarts”. Now Pop-Tarts are nutritionally worthless. Pop-Tarts are barely even food. There’s almost zero nutritive value in Pop-Tarts. It’s just sugar and corn syrup and processed bleached wheat flour that’s completely devoid of nutrients, and a bunch of artificial colors and little sprinkles on top. What is that? Just colored sugar bits. There’s nothing in there that’s going to keep you alive. That’s not even food. Pop-Tarts are entertainment for your mouth. It’s not food for your body. It’s just going to promote hypoglycemia, maybe blood sugar swings, especially for people who are Type two diabetic. There are going to be a lot of diabetics who’ll find that there’s no insulin in a collapse. You’re going to have to change what you eat. You’re not going to be able to live on donuts and ice cream. HealthRangerStore.com/SurvivalQuinoa NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"You’re going to have to figure out a different way to live, to control your blood sugar, which is mostly vegetables and raw foods, nuts and seeds, and simple grains or unprocessed grains like, well, quinoa, which is sort of a grain, but not exactly. The average food that people stock up on is not really food. They load up on bacon with sodium nitrite in it, which causes cancer. The sodium nitrite ingredient, it’s a cancer-causing chemical that’s found in processed meats, but people will stock up on that. They don’t even know that the way to stop those from causing cancer is to take vitamin C with them, so they don’t have vitamin C. You’ll see people who have a freezer full of toxic processed meat and no vitamin C, and a cupboard full of Pop-Tarts, but no actual nutrition anywhere in their kitchen. They’ll tell you that they’re prepared but they’re not. They’ve got wonder bread, which is aptly named, because I often wonder, “Is that bread?” There’s no nutritional value to it. When I am at the grocery store, which is not that often, but at times when I’m there and I observe what’s in other people’s carts, I can’t even believe they’re still alive. Here’s a typical scene in Texas. There’ll be a Latina mom, who’s clearly obese and diabetic with two or three kids who are out of control, climbing all over the place, yelling and screaming because they’re living on sugar and soda. Sure enough, I look in the shopping cart and what’s it full of? Oh, sugar and soda. Lucky Charms cereal. Processed homogenized milk. Cases and cases of soda. Frozen pizza, the cheap crappy kind. This stuff isn’t even food. Then when the average person realizes they have to stock up on foods because something’s about to happen -- such as a civil war or a storm, or the power grids gone down, or whatever -- they will just increase their purchases of the same crap that’s killing them right now. The people who have diabetes, cancer or heart disease because of the toxic foods that they’ve been buying – now, they’ll just go out and stock up on the same foods that are giving them those diseases, including colon cancer, in the first place. “Wow! You’re coating the inside of your colon with cancer-causing chemicals.” “What?” Gosh, shouldn’t be any surprise that cancer develops. We do live in a world of cause and effect. This disconnect exists in the minds of most people, who don’t realize that the foods they eat produce the health effects that they’re experiencing. Sometimes, the doctor will tell them, “Well, yes, you have diabetes, but it’s not your fault, it runs in your family.” They’ll say it like it’s genetic. Yes, because your mom and dad drank soda and ate sugar and taught you the same thing. That’s why you’re diabetic. It’s not genetic. It’s learned self- poisoning. Again, just as a little disclaimer here, I don’t make these audiobooks politically correct. This is about telling you the truth here. My hope is that those listening are not offended by the truth. If you happen to love your Pop-Tarts, you might be disgusted by now, but you can decide what to do. It’s your choice. I’m not going to be your food police here, but you do need to realize there’s a cause and effect at play. I’m not going to try to coddle you and make you feel good about your diet if your diet’s actually killing you. I’m going to point out throughout this entire course things that are toxic in the food supply, so that you can avoid those things. Then I’m going to give you solutions to things that are nourishing, which is the real point here for all the reasons I already mentioned up front. You have to nourish your body, your immune system, your brain, your heart, your fitness level, everything. If you want to survive, you’re in a competition here called “survival of the fittest.” You know who survives hard times? It’s people who are the most adaptive, the most fit and the most prepared. That’s not going to be Mrs. Latina grocery shopper with the soda packs and the hyper kids living on sugar bomb cereal. That’s not who’s going to survive this. I’m just sort of saying it like it is. Let’s move on to the third problem that most people experience, and that is they just lack knowledge about how to use foods to survive; how to prepare foods to survive; how to stretch the food supply; how to combine foods that you’re growing with foods that you’ve stored; and how to combine nutrients in a meal in a way that stabilizes your energy and provides NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 10"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"sustainable productivity for the entire day. People just lack knowledge. They lack knowledge about essential oils and knowledge about herbs. Most people don’t know you can grow your own antibiotics, for example. When I tell you how to grow your own antibiotics, you’re going to say, “Oh, it’s that easy, really?” Yes, it is. You can grow antibiotics. In fact, do you live in a place where there’s a yard? Do you have anything growing in your yard? Well, if so, you’re already growing antibiotics in your yard. Here’s how you’ll know that that’s true. You’ve heard that soil has microbes in it. All soils have microbes. There are all kinds of colonies of microbiology, like bacterial strains and viral strains, living in the soil. You also know that plants have roots that go into the soil. Now I’ll ask you this. Why don’t the microbes in the soil eat the roots of the plants, including maybe grass or dandelions or weeds? What about your trees? How do trees live if there are microbes in the soil? Why aren’t those microbes eating all the tree roots? Guess what the answer is? Because trees produce antibiotics. Grass produces antibiotics. Weeds produce antibiotics. They all produce antibiotics because plants can’t go to the pharmacy. They have to become their own pharmacy. They synthesize all of these very powerful molecules to kill off or defend themselves against microbes in the soil that would otherwise try to eat them. There are antibiotics all around you. You’ve just been taught and brainwashed by the fake news media and Big Pharma. You’ve been brainwashed to think that medicine only comes from a pharmacy. No, that’s fake medicine. Real medicine is all around you, everywhere around you. All in Nature; in the tree leaves, the tree bark, the seeds, the pollen, the roots and the flowers. Plants produce medicine or they would not survive. There is natural medicine all around you. It’s incredible that we, as human beings, live so disconnected from the world that we came from. We co-evolved with Mother Nature all around us. We are compatible with the foods and the plants that grow in the ecosystems that we inhabit. But somehow, we’ve been taught that food comes from a factory and medicine comes from a pharmacy. Those are both fake ideas, but that’s the lack of knowledge that I’m talking about. The average person doesn’t have any knowledge about food or medicine, or even how their body works. The average person can’t point to where their adrenal glands are, and they’ve lived with those glands their whole lives. They don’t even know where they are. They don’t know where their thyroid is located. The average person doesn’t understand how digestion works or what’s the role of the gallbladder. People live in bodies that they don’t even understand. It’s weird. It’s like owning a car and not knowing how to drive it, or having a radio but no owner’s manual. You don’t know how to operate the radio. People live in their bodies, but they don’t know how to run their own bodies, except for the obvious things: entertainment, masturbation, sex, whatever. People do figure those things out on their own. But when it comes to actually understanding how the body works – digestion, neurology, immunology, physiology, all these things -- they’re clueless. It’s like they’re alien in their own skin. It’s weird. It’s like they’re visitors from outer space inhabiting human bodies that they know nothing about. Actually, for some people like Mark Zuckerberg, that might literally be true. I’ll throw in a little humor from time to time. Maybe you don’t think that’s funny. You’re like, “No, man, that’s real.” Okay. I think he’s a cyborg, not an alien. Half-human, half-cyborg, something like that, but that’s beside the point. You’ve got to become good at knowing how your body works and how it interacts with food and nutrients and herbs. Otherwise, you’re not going to be able to survive what’s coming. People talk about even common terms like antioxidants. What is an antioxidant? What role does it play in your body? Why do you need a certain amount of antioxidants? What’s bad about oxidants that needs to be anti’d. We have to talk about that in this course. I will, a little bit. I’m not going to get too crazy technical, but you need to understand the basics of human physiology. Here’s a very important concept. I’ve covered this in other podcasts. When you urinate, do you know what makes your urine yellowish? NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"It’s that you’re urinating out former red blood cells. Red blood cells that are dead and can be eliminated from the body. That’s why your urine typically is a little bit yellow. If you exercise very strenuously, your urine will get darker and darker. If you really kill yourself with exercise, you might urinate something that almost looks brown. Those are your red blood cells dying off and being stripped away by your kidneys and eliminated through your urine. If you’re eliminating red blood cells all the time, you obviously would die of running out. You can’t live without red blood cells. That logically means your body must be making them. Your body’s making red blood cells all the time. I guarantee you the average person in America, plus you, Canadians, have no idea that red blood cells are made in your bones for the most part. You ask a typical person like, “Well, where did red blood cells come from?” They’d be like, “I don’t know.” Usually, a typical uninformed person will say, “They must be made in your heart because that has to do with blood.” They know at least that much. The heart and blood kind of go together. The heart is a pump. They’ve seen that in cartoons or whatever. Maybe the heart makes red blood cells? No, they’re made in your bones. But here’s the key: How are they made? And what are they made of? It turns out, the average person, even if they understand that red blood cells are made in your body, they still think it’s made by magic, like you have a magical blood cell factory that just sort of teleports red blood cells into existence. But that’s not at all what happens, because we don’t live in a magical bio- verse here. We actually live in a cause-and-effect universe based on human physiology. It turns out, your body has to build red blood cells with the hemoglobin and everything. Hemoglobin is a miraculous molecule. It’s pretty cool. It’s like a molecular transformer. In one form, it carries carbon dioxide away, so you can exhale that toxin out of your body. Then it transforms into something that’s like an oxygen magnet, picks up oxygen out of your lungs and takes this quantum leap across lung membranes into your red blood cells. Then your red blood cells carry that oxygen to living cells in your body. Then hemoglobin kind of catapults the oxygen into those living cells and transforms again to a carbon dioxide-carrying molecule. This is some cool stuff. If you’re kind of geeky like me, it’s really cool. Hemoglobin is one of the miracles of modern life, but they are manufactured, they’re made. They’re made of hydrogen and carbon and oxygen atoms, and whatever else goes into them. I haven’t brought up that molecule in a while on the screen to look at it, but it’s a pretty big molecule, and it’s got a lot of atomic elements. HealthRangerStore.com/SurvivalGel NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Now, here’s the question. What is hemoglobin made of? What resources does your body use to make blood? If you think about this and ask someone on the street, if you convince them that their body is actually making blood -- because at some point they will have to join in that conclusion – they’ll say, “Okay! I give up, yes, the body must be making blood. Bu what is it making blood out of?” The answer is it’s making new blood out of things that are in your current blood, because it’s the blood supply that goes to the bones that feed the blood-making factories that assemble new blood molecules, such as hemoglobin and red blood cells, and so on. It’s made out of stuff that’s in your blood because, where else would it come from? You can’t be making blood out of stuff that’s teleported from an alternate dimension. You’re not making blood out of magical fairy vortexes that are in your body, or something like that. You’re making blood out of stuff that’s in your blood. That’s just a logical step. Well, what’s in your blood? What does your blood consist of? The answer is, of course, the stuff that you’ve been eating and drinking and putting on your skin and absorbing. Your blood consists of things that you eat and drink and absorb and, to some extent, what you inhale, because that goes into your blood, too. That means the new blood that you’re making is made out of the stuff that’s in your current blood, which, in turn, is made out of the stuff that you’re eating, drinking, absorbing and inhaling. This means that the quality of the new blood that you’re making depends entirely on the quality of the things that you’re eating, drinking, absorbing and inhaling. What are most people eating and drinking and absorbing and inhaling? Garbage, garbage, garbage, garbage. They are sucking on cigarettes, eating toxic processed foods, drinking a bunch of sodas and alcohol, and absorbing toxic chemicals from the toxic laundry detergent they use because they think it makes the clothes smell good. No. It’s actually causing liver cancer. The average person’s blood is so toxic. I don’t mean to be gross about this, but if humans were a source of food in America, even the USDA would reject the carcasses as unqualified for human consumption. You’d rather eat a cow. The USDA would stamp “Approved” on a cow carcass but “Rejected” on a human carcass because humans are filled with so many toxins. It’s outrageous, and it’s all because of what they eat and drink. What does this have to do with survival? It all comes back around. It has to do with everything that you need in the context of survival, such as wound healing and cognitive function. What feeds your brain? Your blood feeds your brain. Your brain is powered by what’s in your blood, blood glucose, for example. What’s your blood made of again? Everything that you’ve been eating and drinking and absorbing and inhaling. The function of your brain depends on the things that you’re consuming. If you’re consuming crap foods (i.e., Pop-Tarts and macaroni and cheese) and smoking pot all day because you want to chill, then your brain function is going to be frankly retarded. I don’t mean that in a condescending way. I mean it in a medical way. The retardation of cognitive function, that’s what’s going to happen. Can you survive in a mentally retarded state? Probably not. Although I’m sure that there will be plenty of people who’ll try, but they will be obvious because they will be the ones who are dead. Not a good way to survive. Everything that you take into your body becomes the building blocks of everything that physically exists in your body, that runs your immune system, your heart and your brain. Your heart is powered by fuel in your blood, just as your brain is, along with your digestive system, muscles, tendons, skin, eyeballs, everything. Nutritional survival should be a fundamental subject of every person who exists as a human being. You have to learn how to NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"run the body that you are currently inhabiting. In case you plan on leaving it, at least leave behind an owner’s manual for the next soul that takes it over or, in the case of certain evil people, the next demon that infests their body. That must be weird, demons coming into people’s bodies, possessing them and showing up with like, “Oh my gosh, there’s this body that’s full of toxins.” Fits right in for some of those demons. They’re like, “Yeah! It feels like hell in here, it’s like very familiar.” But for the rest of us, we should attempt to attain more of a god-like body of health. That means more divine nutrition, nutrition based on light, not darkness; health, not sickness; and joy, not suffering. Survival Nutrition is about so much more than food. It’s about being in harmony with your body in a way that promotes sustainability, survivability and adaptability. This is way more than just a simple course about how to make it through a societal collapse. This is about how to survive the rest of your life in your body, because that’s probably where you’re going to be. Unless you have some weird trading places kind of a technology. Remember the old Eddie Murphy movie with him and Dan Aykroyd trading places, switching bodies? That was fiction. I don’t think that you or I are ever going to experience that. We’re going to have to learn to live in the bodies that we have. All of this knowledge becomes really critical for surviving in these bodies. That’s what this is really about. In summary, this course is not just about food, nutrients, herbs and raw materials that you can acquire and deploy based on strategic principles of survival. It’s also about long-term survivability, even when your body is under attack by biological weapons, infectious diseases, physical assaults and injuries, the stresses of our world, chem trail poisons, toxins in the food supply, toxins in the medicine, pharmaceuticals, mass medication, toxic fragrance chemicals in the laundry detergent – every kind of poison that you can imagine. This is about how to survive all that as well, not just the collapse of society. You’ll find that the skills and knowledge that I present here are universal across all of those scenarios. If you learn how to stay alive in peacetime and you really master this information, you’ll also be able to stay alive more easily during difficult times. The truth is, most people aren’t even surviving peacetime. Most people are dying right now. They’re dying with every bite of toxic food that they put into their bodies. They’re dying with every prescription medication that they swallow. They’re dying with every load of laundry that they do that’s full of toxic, cancer-causing chemicals. They’re dying all the time, and that’s why they look dead. They’re already kind of leaving their bodies because their soul is like, “Get me out of here! I can’t stand this. This is crazy.” When you really experience maximum health -- as I’ll teach you how to do in this course -- you’ll find that your soul becomes more enlivened as well. You’ll have more connection to yourself and to Nature, and to the world around you. You’ll have more connection to God, connection with divine principles; you’ll be more awake, alive and aware. This has everything to do with survival because, believe me, if you’re in some zombied-out state or medicated, bouncing off a sugar high, you’ll be depressed and angry. You’ll be all moody and everything because you only stocked up on Pop-Tarts and corn dogs. Your soul won’t even want to be there. Survival won’t really be very likely in that situation because you’re already half dead. We can’t talk about survival unless we stopped killing ourselves first. That should be the number one point of this course. People are killing themselves every day with every meal and every medication. People are killing themselves. People are suicidal, and they almost have some kind of pride in it. “Oh, today I drank 12 beers and I ate three pizzas.” Do you think this is a competition?

I could bring you a participation trophy, if that would help, but we might want to get you a colon cleanse. I don’t know what it is that people are trying to do with their health, but it seems to me that most people just want to destroy themselves, and I mean that literally. I think even psychologically, maybe some of you listening are psychologists or psychiatrists. I think if you dig down into the layers of most of your patients, don’t they all ultimately want to just kill themselves? If they could just bring a gun into your sessions and put that gun to their temple and pull the trigger, that would actually be their ultimate solution. They’re just too cowardly to do it. They really just want to kill themselves. They go out and they attract bad relationships, and they have bad sex with risky partners and they have horrible food habits, and they just burn themselves out. Why? Because they hate themselves. They would rather die. The way to turn that around, at least part of the way, is to fix what’s in the blood that’s powering the brain. This is the missing gap that psychologists and psychiatrists don’t normally understand. I don’t mean to put down psychologists, they perform a very valuable service for society. But it’s kind of like, at some point, if your patient or client is angry and moody all the time, you might want to ask, what are you eating? What’s wrong with your physiology? Why do you have these blood sugar swings? Do you know what substances you’re abusing? What heavy metals are you putting into your body that’s causing this violent, aggressive behavior? Lead causes aggression and violence, it is a well-established fact. Copper causes people to become schizophrenics. The gap that psychologists have often is that they’re always trying to solve things by talking about it. “Oh, we’re going to peel away the layers of your ID, and we’re going to do this therapy where you imagine this and that.” Well, maybe the person just needs to stop poisoning themselves and eat healthier. And guess what? All those problems will go away, or at least a lot of them. I’m not saying their bad family, memories or whatever they’re dealing with are going to go away, but their ability to handle that will be so much more resilient when you’ve got good nutrition and adaptogens. I’m talking about foods and herbs and molecules that have adaptogenic properties that not only help reduce inflammation throughout your body, but also give your neurology more resilience when needed. Adaptogens. Plenty of foods and herbs fill that role, and that’s what’s missing in our society. Don’t even get me started on teachers that like to drug all the children with ADHD drugs. “Oh, you’re too hyper, you’re learning too fast.” “You want to go outside and be in the real world, must be something wrong with you.” “Let’s drug you up with toxic medications so that you will be obedient.” “Look, little Johnny sitting there numbed out, drugged out in a state, a zombie-like status.” “Oh, he’s the perfect student now.” NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"“Now, we can indoctrinate them with public school brainwashing. That’s considered a success.” That’s part of the problem with our world. What little Johnny really needs probably is a better diet and some playtime outside. School lunches are crazy toxic, that’s for sure. These are some of the things that we’re about to get into here, okay? This is just the introduction so far. I just wanted to give you a taste of what you’re about to learn here and kind of explain where I’m coming from on all of this. Survival Nutrition is about so much more than you might normally think. It’s about surviving your entire life in the body that you live in and using nutrition to achieve that. That’s what I’m an expert in. That’s what I’m going to share with you throughout this course.

Download the nine-hour audiobook for free at GlobalReset.news. In this chapter, we’re going to talk about the myths of nutrition, and why everything that you know about nutrition or everything you think you know might be wrong in the context of survival. We’ll start with the basics here. A lot of people, they like to buy foods that keep them slim and fit and trim. They’ll go to the grocery store and look for foods that claim to be, for example, “fat free.” Now, I’m a food scientist, and I’m a nutritionist, and so on. People shopping for fat-free foods are probably – I hate to be cruel, but they’re probably – very fat themselves. They’re probably not very healthy. Healthy people don’t look for fat-free foods. Healthy people look for healthy fats. I drink blended avocados every day for over 15 years now, that’s my breakfast. I should give you the recipe. I know it sounds kind of gross, but let me just tell you, it’s delicious. You take a fresh avocado, maybe a frozen large banana, some coconut water and a little bit of whey protein. You put in some cacao powder to give it kind of a chocolatey taste, some flax seeds and whatever else you think you want to put in there that’s going to go with a creamy, chocolatey type of milkshake taste. You blend all that together. If you use frozen bananas like I do, then you get kind of like a delicious, smooth, fat-filled but sweet kind of chocolate smoothie, like a chocolate shake. It’s the most amazing thing in the world. That’s why I’ve been drinking it for 15 years. You can put coconut water in it or just use regular water. You could put almond milk in it or not. You can switch it up, and it’ll still be incredibly healthy. This has been my breakfast for probably more than 15 years at this point. Oh, I also put turmeric in it, so it looks orange, kind of mustardy. That freaks people out. They’re like, “What are you drinking? Shrek’s breakfast?” “What is that stuff? Are you having like a honey mustard chug-a-lug?” “What? What are you doing?” People just get totally flipped out. It does taste weird if you overdo the turmeric powder. At first, you kind of have to acquire that taste. I like my breakfast to be, number one, super delicious and secondly, really, really healthy. Most importantly, it needs to provide nutrients that are going to keep me running and my brain working. It needs to keep my body working throughout the day because, you know, I’m lifting weights, six days a week. I’m doing cardio exercise and I’m using my brain. I’m doing podcasts and articles and videos, writing every day, doing research and managing my business, and so on. It’s very demanding. I’m not one of those people who only sleep four hours a night. No. I like to have a full eight hours of sleep, thank you very much. I’m not into sleep deprivation. I got to get all this stuff done in 16 hours every day. How do I do it? Well, number one, I don’t watch television. I don’t waste time socializing with people. I do consider that a waste of most of the time. I have good nutrition that keeps me at peak performance throughout the day. I also take a lot of supplements. What supplements do I take? Well, loads of vitamin C, some zinc, some resveratrol, CoQ10, pycnogenol, vitamin K2, grape seed extract, probiotics, nattokinase, plenty of vitamin D, and so on. I take different food concentrates, like quercetin. I take a lot of supplements and different herbs, keeps me in peak performance, whereas the average American is out there shopping for food that says fat-free or sugar-free. Just to decode this for you, fat-free means it’s loaded with sugar, and sugar-free means it’s loaded with artificial sweetener chemicals. That’s all it means! Sugar-free means it’s loaded with cancer-causing chemicals; fat-free means it’s loaded with sugar. Chapter Two NUTRITION MYTHS NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 17"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Healthy people don’t look for fat-free food. They don’t buy fat-free, and they don’t buy sugar-free. No, I don’t think I’ve ever had anything in my shopping cart that said fat-free or sugar-free. The average consumer in America that’s in a grocery store, they have no idea what healthy food is. When it comes to Survival Nutrition, they are totally lost. In a survival context, you need fat. You need fat to power you through your day because fat is high-density caloric nutrition when it’s a healthy plant-based fat, i.e., fat from avocados, fat from almonds, fat from nuts and seeds and all these healthy fats; occasionally fat from butter or fat from animal lard where appropriate in a recipe. There are recipes where animal lard actually makes a lot of sense, believe it or not, or you can just go vegetarian on that. You can throw in some olive oil or coconut oil, whatever works for you, but get some healthy fats, for God’s sake. But that doesn’t mean canola oil, corn oil and partially hydrogenated, genetically modified soybean oil – those aren’t healthy fats. They’re garbage junk food. Those are ingredients that are used in popular storable food products that are not organic, like soup mixes and stuff in creamy chicken soup. It’s all genetically modified crap oils that contain trans fats that promote heart disease, so avoid that stuff. Healthy fats are critical for your survival. I already mentioned some of the obvious choices you’d want to look for in the grocery store, things that you could stock up on. For example, coconut oil. Coconut oil is incredibly healthy. It’s full of MCTs, it’s anti-inflammatory and it’s antibacterial. Did you know you can use coconut oil to clean your firearms and lubricate your guns, or put it in a smoothie? Yes, no kidding. It’s good for your heart, it’s good for your brain and it’s good for your body. Coconut oil contains healthy, slow-burning fats, and it’s delicious in a lot of recipes, especially certain types of smoothies. You can even fry up some pancakes in coconut oil and have like coconut Hawaiian-themed tropical paradise pancakes today with banana chunks in them or whatever you’ve got. You can also put little freeze-dried mango bits in there. That’s good stuff. It’s good for you. And coconut oil can be stored for a very long time. So right there is a major tip. Coconut oil is sold everywhere. I would only buy organic. Fortunately, organic is very readily available. It used to be a specialty item. I mean, we sell it at HealthRangerStore.com. It used to be that you can only get it online, but now it’s in every grocery store. You can just go out and find that at your grocery store and just buy organic. I think Nutiva is a brand that I’ve seen in grocery stores. I know the founder of Nutiva, John Roulac. He’s a cool guy, definitely into some good coconut oil. That’s a good brand you can pick up at the grocery store. I don’t know if he still runs the company. I have no idea, but when he founded, it was rocking. Coconut oil can be used for so many things. You can use it as a lubricant, both as personal lubricant as well as a mechanical lubricant. If you need to fix a squeaky hinge on a door or to lubricate your actual guns, your firearms, you can use coconut oil. You can clean your pistol with coconut oil. I actually have a video that shows how to do that. That video is at PrepWithMike.com , if you want to see it. You should have a big jar of coconut oil and clean a pistol with it. It works amazingly well. In fact, there’s a very expensive, high-end gun cleaner and lubricant on the market -- I’m not going to say the name -- but all it is is coconut oil with green coloring in it, and a little bit of mint oil. That’s it! It’s just coconut oil at 10 times the price of coconut oil. For some reason, people have resistance to the idea of just opening a jar of coconut oil and using it to clean their gun. There’s a lot of resistance, for some reason, in the minds of people. They want a gun lube that says “Gun Lube” on it, even though it’s just coconut oil.

They want a kitchen soap, then they want a bathroom soap. Then they want a toilet soap. They’re called toilet cleaner, tile cleaner, scrub cleaner, sink cleaner, dish soap, hand soap and body soap. It’s all soap, people! It’s all the same, soap! It’s just soap with different labels on it and different concentrations of water in it, different colors. It’s all just soap! Soap is just a chemical that binds oils to water and makes oils dissolve in water. That’s all soap does. It’s a special molecule. All soap does is it allows oil molecules to hold hands with water molecules to make them soluble, so that you can lift oil out of clothing or whatever and get rid of it with water. It’s just soap, folks. I use the same soap for washing my hair and for shaving. I just put that soap on my face as a lubricant for shaving, wash my body with the same soap, wash my hands with the same soap, wash pots and pans with the same soap. It’s the soap that we sell. It’s an all- purpose soap. I don’t even know how I got off on that subject, but it’s just so odd to me that you can go into the grocery store and there are entire aisles of products that are basically all the same thing with different colors and shapes, different bottles and names, different scents and fragrances. Are people really that stupid that they will buy 15 different types of soap for their house? And the answer is yes. I mean, the same thing is true with lubrication. People are like, “I’ve got a can of household oil and then I need a special oil.” “I have a garage door, so I need spring oil.” “Oh, I’ve got a special oil for firearms, so I need firearms oil.” I don’t know what kinds of oils people have. Like people, it’s all the same oil. You can open a can of motor oil and use it to lube your firearm. You can open a can of motor oil for your car. You can use it to lubricate your garage door springs or a doorknob, or whatever you need to lubricate. Frankly, you could do that with olive oil or soybean oil. say with a degreaser.” When you have knowledge about these subjects, you should immediately say, “Oh, that’s d-limonene,” which is the molecule from orange peel. It’s an orange peel extract, d-limonene. It’s also found in lemon peels. Just add a little bit of d-limonene to water and you have a window spray for pennies instead of spending dollars for that toxic blue crap that they sell at the grocery store in a spray bottle. It’s mostly ammonia – not sure what’s in there exactly. They made it blue, so it must work, right? That’s what people say. Blue cleaners have to be blue. No, not at all. I’ve seen it in the store, like the hardware store. They’re selling eco-friendly, petroleum-free soybean lubricant. Yes, it’s called freaking soybean oil. It’s 50 cents a gallon at the grocery store. You don’t have to pay $10 a gallon at the hardware store for an eco- certified, super green, planet- friendly plant-based lubrication oil. No, it’s just soy oil folks. Just pick it up at the grocery store. You don’t have to limit your use to what’s listed on the label. The label is for suckers. Real people know about molecules. They know what’s a lubricant, what’s a solvent, what’s an oil, what’s water and what a water-based substance is. If I say to you, “Okay, we need a substance that’s going to cut grease, something that cuts grease and that’s water soluble because we need to degrease something.

To handle all these household tasks, you just need a bottle of soap, a container of baking soda and a container of motor oil, maybe a little bit of d-limonene. You only need a few things. Then you can lubricate everything. You can clean everything. You can wash everything. You can degrease everything. You can handle everything. And yet, there’s a whole store full of cleaning products. The same thing is true about food. People don’t know what food is, so they ended up buying all this packaged food, which is just a thousand different versions of genetically modified corn: corn syrup, corn flour, corn maltodextrin, corn syrup solids, corn tortillas, corn flakes and cornbread. Again, corn syrup. There’s corn syrup in your spaghetti sauce, corn syrup in your pizza sauce, corn syrup in your cereal, corn syrup in tea drinks. It’s just a thousand different versions of corn. Why not buy buckets of corn? And then you’ve got the corn. You can make anything out of it, anything that calls for corn in a recipe. You can grind it up and dry the corn kernels. You would probably get them dry, put them in a bucket. You can grind them up and make cornmeal. You can use cornmeal with some salt and pepper, and some oil, and have a fish fry, fry up some okra. Okra is easy to grow. Oh, did I just accidentally admit that I’m from the Midwest on that one? Well, I’m sorry. Maybe you thought I was from the deep South. “Okra? Who is this crazy white boy eating okra with cornbread?” Yes, no joke. One of the most delicious meals ever. Fry that up in some oil in a pan with some salt and pepper and you have fried okra, folks. That stuff will keep you alive. It’s easy to grow and harvest. Okra grows quickly. It’s pretty much overgrown by the time you realize it’s already there. You’ll be like, “Oh my gosh, that okra is too big now. Forgot to clip it off when it was small enough and tender.” You got to get those okras when they’re young. You don’t want some old stringy okra; it turns in a dental floss in your mouth. You see what I’m getting at here? It’s that you can purchase food staples. You can purchase large quantities of organic wheat, organic quinoa, organic rice, pinto beans, red beans, black beans, lentils, oats, kamut, whatever you need to purchase – corn, barley, all these different things. With just a little bit of knowledge, and maybe a grain grinder – like a hand-cranked grain grinder, which doesn’t cost that much – you’ll be able to make food out of these things. Don’t get the electric grain grinders, get the hand-powered ones so you can use them like a little hand-powered grain mill. Yes, it’s a little bit of work, I agree, but you’ll be able to make food without electricity. Why would you do this? Why would you have a grain mill? Why wouldn’t you just store wheat flour or cornmeal or cereals that are already ground up from Bob’s Red Mill, or whatever ground-up millet flour. Why wouldn’t you store that? The answer is because that stuff has no shelf life. Once you disturb the integrity of the grain, its shelf life is slashed by a factor of – usually – ten. If you try to store a bag of wheat flour, that bag might have a shelf life of six months, whereas if you’re storing wheat berries, store them in a five-gallon pail, a polyethylene white plastic pail with an airtight lid that’s hammered on. That sucker’s rat-proof, light-proof, moisture-proof and air-proof. Not quite bulletproof, but almost. And that will store actually for 20 years, as long as you keep it relatively cool. Once you grind up the wheat berries, its shelf life goes down to just a few months. If you’re going to store food NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 20"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"as part of your survival strategy here, you’ll need to buy whole grain foods, buy the intact food at the grocery store that’s usually on the bottom shelf. “Oh, here’s the wheat berries. Here’s the lentils. Here’s the beans.” You may even have to go online and find a food storage place that sells the whole foods in a storable format, because that’s what’s going to give you shelf life. Then you just take out the food as you need it and grind it up, make the flour and then make the bread as you need it. You make the cornmeal as you need it to make cornbread. Just a little commentary on cornbread. I don’t know what’s happening to cornbread in America, but American people think cornbread is now cake. Actually, they think corn cake is cornbread, but it isn’t. Cornbread is not supposed to be sweet. I don’t know who came up with that idea. Basically, restaurants in America today, they’ll serve you cornbread. It’s actually like corn muffin. Let’s just be honest, it’s a corn-freaking-muffin. It’s a spongy, sugared up, kind of slightly orange, yellowish-colored something that doesn’t even taste like corn. That’s just corn cake. I was in Branson, Missouri giving a speech last year for the GenSix conference. There was one of these kind of Midwest restaurants – I forgot what it’s called – one of those family-style dining places that are not too high- end. It seems like it had the word bucket in it or something, the name of the restaurant. I’m sorry to say – if you’re from Southern Missouri listening to this, I’m absolutely not trying to be insulting by any means. But my God, there wasn’t a person there under an obesity rating of – I mean, everybody in that restaurant was overweight. I’ve never seen a parade of obesity like that before in my life. I was really amazed. They served cornbread and it was corn cake, and then it all clicked. Those people thought they were eating cornbread, but they were not. They were eating corn cake along with fake gravy on their biscuits. I had to get out of there before they turned me into one of them, before I got too heavy to be able to get out of my chair and exit of the place. Everything they were serving was the kind of food that you would use to fatten up cattle before slaughtering them. It was all processed garbage food, and that’s what people are used to eating. To circle this back around to the whole point here: When people go to the grocery store, they tend to stock up on things that have no nutritive value, things that make them fat, that give them heart disease and cancer and diabetes. They stock up on things that taste good because they come with flavor packets. “Oh, open this flavor packet. Here, instant gravy. Just add water to this powdered MSG.” But it’s just maltodextrin and cornstarch, really, because that’s not the kind of gravy that my grandmother used to make. That’s not gravy. Gravy is supposed to be the drippings of sausage, real pork sausage that came out of a white wax paper wrapper and came from the slaughterhouse, where they processed a couple of hogs last week. That sausage is fresh. If you fry it up in a pan and take the sausage out, what do you have left over? Grease, right? Liquid grease. Well, what does a grandma do with that grease? You’re not going to throw that out, not when you live on a farm. Not when you’re out in the country and you’re trying to survive on food. You take that grease, you put in some corn starch with water, a little bit of salt and pepper. Add butter to that grease, and you have gravy, real gravy. HealthRangerStore.com/SurvivalMCTOil NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 21"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"You put that on some biscuits, I might eat that. But I’m not eating your fake MSG gravy at your bucket and barrel restaurant, whatever it’s called. It just might as well be called cattle corral. Isn’t there actually a restaurant called Golden Corral? When the door opens, does it just go like a cow in a shed? Because they just greet you with a giant moo. “Welcome to the feeding trough with fake gravy and fake food and corn cake.” It’s just disgusting. People run around the grocery store, buying all the crap that they’re used to eating, and they think its survival food when it’s actually death food. That’s what they’re doing every day. They’re dying from all the toxic food they’re eating. They’re not surviving at all. They’re dying. They’re committing processed food suicide on a daily basis. Cracker Barrel. I think maybe that’s the name of the restaurant. Does that sound familiar to anybody? Cracker Barrel? I was thinking bucket, but it’s actually barrel. Cracker Barrel. That’s what it was. It was like a giant warehouse of obese people. Just stunning. It really was emblazoned on my mind that there is a real obesity problem in Branson, Missouri. No question about it. I don’t mean to make light of it. I’m sorry if I’m offending anybody. We’ve all had challenges in our lives, and I’m not as light and thin as I used to be. I used to be super thin, but I’m not that way anymore. I can’t blame anybody else I suppose, but my goodness, could we make better health choices in this country? Could we, maybe, serve food that is for humans and not cattle? That’s all I’m saying. When you go out buying survival foods at the grocery store, it’s really critical that you recognize the difference. I’m trying to circle this back around; I keep getting distracted. I apologize, but people are buying a thousand different versions of processed garbage ingredients at the grocery store: mostly genetically modified corn, processed corn syrup and processed bleached white flour, which has nothing in it other than empty calories. That’s not storable food. The biggest myth that people need to undo or unlearn in all of this is really just understanding what is food, because by definition, food should have nutritive value. Food should nourish your body. Food should not be just a source of entertainment for your mouth. Food is in your mouth for 60 seconds. Even that’s kind of a long chew time for a lot of people, 60 seconds. Then it goes through your body for 24 to 96 hours, depending on how often you have a bowel movement. For some people, 96 hours isn’t even enough. Once food is in your body, it’s in contact with your inner body for much longer than the one minute that it’s in your mouth. Yet most people eat for that one minute of pleasure on the lips, in the mouth. “Oh my God, this texture of sugar and partially hydrogenated soybean oil – cake icing – oh, it’s so amazing.” And then they swallow it. You should spit that stuff out. That’s not food. It’s just entertainment for your tongue. Okay, lick it around a little bit then spit it out. You want to eat something? Make sure it’s food. I’m sorry, but cake icing is not food, especially not the artificial icing that’s made today with nothing but partially hydrogenated oils. People out there are buying all that Crisco vegetable shortening. You know why it’s called vegetable shortening? Because it’s shortening your lifespan; that’s what it is. That’s the truth. That says partially hydrogenated soybean oil, corn oil, canola oil, whatever it is. That’s crazy. People cook with that. A lot of women love to bake with that. “Oh, we’ve got to make some cookies for everybody, gotta use some shortening because we gotta shorten the life span of all these children who are going to eat these cookies.” “We gotta make some cake with some shortening to shorten some life spans. It’s crazy! They don’t want to use coconut oil because coconut oil leaks out of the cookies. It makes it greasy under the cookies. No one wants to touch greasy cookies. Shortening stays in the cookie. Shortening stays in the cracker – if you’re making crackers or whatever. That’s why it’s used in all the baked goods in grocery stores. NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 22"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"I go down the cookie and cracker aisle and it’s just, “oh, this one shortens my life span. This one causes diabetes and shortens my life span. This one causes heart disease, obesity and mood disorders and shortens my life span. Let’s get that one because it’s got sprinkles on top.” That’s what people do. They run around the grocery store, mentally simulating, like, “How’s this going to taste in my mouth? Hmm. Get those cheese nips. That’s going to be good. Oh, look at that icing. What about that raw cookie dough? I could lick the plastic bag when I’m done squeezing the cookie dough out.” This is the way children think, but it’s the way adults shop. What you should be doing is engaging your brain and saying, “Okay, what is going to nourish my body and mind? What in this grocery store is going to give me molecules that equal nutrition? What’s going to make me healthy and happy and have longevity instead of shortening my life span?” You should walk around the store looking at foods from that perspective. What’s going to make me healthy? What’s going to prevent cancer? There are anti- cancer foods all throughout the fresh produce section. Almost everything you touch there is anti- cancer – pomegranates, celery, limes, garlic, ginger, turmeric, beet roots, spinach – every vegetable you see in stores is practically anti-cancer, including leaks and onions. But people don’t think that way. They just want to know what’s going to taste good, what’s going to cause an entertainment explosion in their mouth. Those people are not going to survive. This is Survival Nutrition. This is not entertainment for your face. If you want to be entertained, go to some Hunger Games Capitol City banquet with a festival of fancy muffins or something. That’s not what this is about. This is about Survival Nutrition. Survival Nutrition means you’ve got to change your perspective of what food is. I know I’m giving you some tough love here right now, a little bit of maybe politically incorrect truth that might offend a few people, but it doesn’t matter. If it keeps you alive and changes your perspective of what food is, then it’s worth the whole effort to produce this, to share it with you and for you to hear this message. Open up your refrigerator right now, look in there. Tell me, what do you have in your fridge that isn’t food, that’s just entertainment garbage? Get it out of there. Open up your pantry. What’s in there that’s just garbage, that’s got shortening in it? Yes, probably a lot of stuff in that pantry is full of shortening, MSG, artificial colors and toxic substances. Your coffee creamer, you know that stuff? That’s all just powdered shortening, powdered dried shortening, basically, is what that is. It’s toxic. Get it out of there. If you want cream in your coffee, just buy some real cream. It’s healthier for you. Just use real food. There’s nothing wrong with having fat in your diet if it’s real-food fat, healthy food fat. Like I said, avocado and coconut oil, nuts and seeds. I mean, even lard, lard is better for you than shortening. You’re probably like, “Lard? Well, that’s animal fat. And science has said that animal fat is bad for you and that we should all eat shortening.” Yes, scientists in the 1980s were paid by the shortening industry to tell you that you should be eating vegetable oils. It created a whole industry of cardiovascular and heart disease, a whole industry of statin drugs and mood disorders, and open-heart transplant surgery, or coronary bypass surgery. It’s a whole industry created by those who paid off and bribed dishonest food scientists, who were really just PR spokespeople for the vegetable oils industry. It was a massive organized scam, kind of like Big Tobacco. Remember how Big Tobacco had full-page ads in the Journal of the American Medical Association. “Doctors smoke more camels than any other cigarette.” “My doctor told me that smoking makes my teeth white.” Ads like that. Remember that? That’s from the 1950s. HealthRangerStore.com/SurvivalNuts NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 23"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"The whole vegetable oils thing in the 1980s was the same thing. In fact, many of the PR companies were the same companies that used to promote Big Tobacco. Now they’re like, “You should eat margarine because butter is bad for you.” They said, “Eggs are bad for you, because eggs, they’ve got yolks.” And they’ll tell you to eat margarine. Have you ever looked up how margarine is made? It’s the most disgusting process you could imagine. Disgusting and bad for you. Toxic vegetable oils, usually partially hydrogenated, it’s nasty crap. It’s very, very bad stuff. The overall lesson here – and I know I’ve got a lot more to cover here in chapter two, I’m just getting started. I’m sorry to interrupt with so many stories here, but if you don’t grasp the difference between food versus non-food then the rest of this course won’t make any sense at all. We all need to be able to go to the grocery store and tell the difference – discernment between food and garbage. You’ve probably heard this before and it’s true. Most of the actual real food is located on the outer perimeter of the store, typically the fresh produce section, whereas all the junk, processed fake food is in the middle of the store, the aisles with the cereals, the crackers, the instant gravy mixes and all that garbage. Usually that’s all non- food. The sodas, the chips and the dips, and the instant, frozen microwaveable bag of delicious scrumptiousness, whatever, they’re all fake food. Who microwaves their food in a plastic bag anyway? People who love to eat plastic. I mean, I’m sorry to interrupt, but is anybody dumb enough to microwave food in a plastic bag and then eat that? You know bisphenol A is in that plastic, and when you cook it, it’s kind of like sautéing your food in hormone disruptors. You eat that stuff long enough and every man develops breasts, becomes like transgender Bob. Transgender Bob is having lunch again. Oh, microwaveable plastic food bag. “Hey Bob, what cup size are you up to today?” Bob doesn’t know why he has breasts. It’s because he’s been eating hormone chemicals. I feel sorry for Bob. Maybe he should go back to Cracker Barrel and have some fake corn cake. It’s fake gravy, but at least it’s not plastic. I guess there are different levels of toxic garbage food. They’re fake food, but at least they’re not plastic. Although I’m not saying that they won’t ever try that at Cracker Barrel. Maybe one day, you’ll order flapjacks and they’ll just come out and say, “Here’s a plastic stack of pancake fakery for you here. Just eat that.” “Okay! Let’s pour on the fake syrup and let’s use the fake butter or shortening. Let’s spread the butter-flavored margarine and just eat plastic pancakes, and we’ll all grow breasts. They have like transgender rainbow flags right out there in front of the restaurant. I’m sure that will fly really well in the Bible Belt of Branson, Missouri, I say facetiously. The truth is, people are eating crazy non-food stuff, and then they wonder why they get cancer or diabetes or heart disease, or what have you. The answer is cause and effect. If you don’t know the difference between food and non-food, you’re out of luck for the whole concept of Survival Nutrition. If we’re going to live, if we’re going to be healthy, if we’re going to survive the collapse that’s frankly already beginning right under our noses here, we’re going to have to have food, REAL food. Not fake, artificial, processed, partially pasteurized, trans fatty, hydrogenated, GMO garbage crap with maltodextrin. That’s not going to keep you alive. Not at all. That’s the most important lesson. Next here in chapter two, we’re going to get into other myths because, believe it or not, I’ve only covered one myth so far. That’s how far behind I am now in this course. I’ve only covered one myth and we’ve got like seven more myths to go. I guess the biggest myth is that I could get through this course in a timely manner, isn’t it? There’s so much to share about this. I’ve observed so many people who are doing so many crazy things with fake food. I just cannot stay silent about it, and I NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 24"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"had to share it with you. Look, I want people to live. I want people to survive. Then I look in their shopping carts in the grocery store and I’m just like a mental checklist: “Ah, you’re going to die. And you’re going to die. And you look dead already.” It’s like, how are you even living long enough to make it through this line here? How do you even function in the self- checkout lane with all that toxic, cancer-causing food that you’ve got there, right there in that cart? God, I hope that your abdomen doesn’t spill out right now, because what’s inside you, it’s probably a reflection of what’s there in the cart and that’s pretty gross. We don’t want to see that. Buckle up people. You, going through the grocery store with all your toxic foods, buckle up. I don’t want to see what’s coming out of you. It’s kind of horrifying. It’s like a culinary digestive horror show going on in there. No, thank you. Not interested. We will continue with more of this obviously politically incorrect Survival Nutrition course, if you can bear it. If you’re still listening, you have a stronger stomach than most. I guarantee it. Look, I didn’t say this is going to be – that it’s going to go down easily. No, this is some harsh truth. I am not going to hold back. I’m going to hit you with more of this as we continue. So, stay with me as we continue chapter two here. I’m going to go online and find a Cracker Barrel menu, see if I can pull up some ingredients lists because I do need to review chemicals. That ought to be fascinating. Learn more at NaturalNews.com . HealthRangerStore.com/SurvivalGrassFed NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Continuing with our discussion of myths about storable food, let’s talk about canned soup for a moment, because people who are uninformed think that canned soup is the way to go to get storable food. Canned soup is mostly water, so you’re buying a lot of water and taking up a lot of space with the soup cans. Not only that, but the soup cans are usually lined with a plastic liner on the inside that contains bisphenol A, which is a hormone disruptor that gives men breasts and probably promotes prostate cancer, breast cancer and reproductive disorders. If you like to eat your way to cancer and transgenderism, load up on canned foods for the apocalypse. You can have male breasts before the bombs hit. I don’t know, whatever your end here, it’s up to you. Why would you buy a bunch of water in cans? Wherever you live, you should have a source of water. That’s a basic item. Maybe you have a pond. Maybe you have rainwater catchment off of your roof. Maybe you have a well. Maybe you live next to a river or a stream, or you’ve got other sources of water. You don’t need to store water. You need to live somewhere where there’s water and where water falls out of the sky. Why would you go to the grocery store and buy water? That’s a horrible use of money and storage space. Instead of buying a can of pork and beans – which almost has no pork in it anyway, just a little chunk of pork fat – you could go buy a bag of beans, dried beans, red beans or whatever those are. Store them dry in a pail and they would have a 20-year shelf life. They would be much lighter in terms of the food that you’re storing per pound. In other words, if you’re buying canned soups, you’re buying a bunch of water that’s heavy and expensive. Why buy expensive, heavy water? You should be getting that for free because it falls out of the sky. Purchase bulk items like red beans, lentils, quinoa, rice, wheat, corn, oats, all those things. Buy them in bulk, buy them dry and store them in buckets and pails. You can always add water later. And you’re probably going to be cooking it anyway. Even if you added water that wasn’t a hundred percent purified, it would probably kill bacteria when you’re boiling the water to cook the beans. It’s kind of self-sterilizing when you’re cooking it. The other thing about canned soups is that they’re not very nutritious. There’s a lot of processed garbage in canned soups and, of course, they’re very high in sodium, which may not be as big a deal in a survival scenario if you’re sweating a lot because you’re working a lot. You might actually need more sodium in your diet, but then again, there’s a lot of sodium in canned soup. If you think about it, most of what you’re buying in canned soup is salt water. The water should be free and salt is dirt cheap. Why would you pay $20 a pound so you can have salt and water with a little bit of beans in it or something? That’s just crazy. Finally, canned soups and canned goods, they don’t last very long. They really don’t, especially anything with tomatoes in it. The tomatoes are acidic, and it NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 26"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"eats right through the can. Before long, you’ve got like this black gooey, formerly tomato paste oozing out of the side of a can in your cupboard. That can happen in just two years. That’s not a good way to store food; it’s just a really bad idea. In fact, when I see people who have a lot of canned food and they think they’re into food storage, that’s when I know they don’t know anything about food storage. I understand having a few canned meats to add to other meals that you’re making out of quinoa, rice and other dried goods. That makes sense. I understand having cans of butter, for example. I understand those types of things. I’m talking about people who buy canned beans and canned corn and canned vegetables and canned apricots. If you want fruit, you should buy freeze-dried fruit. It’s lighter, it’s way more nutritious, and it doesn’t taste gross. Who eats canned fruit? That’s just crazy. Don’t stock up on canned goods. It’s a waste of time, money and space. Let’s move on to the next myth. The next myth is the myth of the supply line. People think that food magically appears in the grocery stores every day. No matter how much they buy, it’s going to appear the next day, because I guess grocery elves work there at night. They come in and they sprinkled pixie dust or whatever it is across the shelves, and then replacement products magically appeared, because that’s what grocery elves are all about. The average consumer doesn’t think, “No, a truck has to come and deliver that.” Somebody has to offload the pallets with a forklift, and somebody has got to put it on the shelf. Even before it gets on the truck, somebody has got to manufacture it in a food factory that’s probably shut down because of the COVID-19 lockdowns. There are supply line disruptions that are very, very bad, that are severe. And people aren’t considering that. When the average person thinks, “Oh, I don’t need stored food, I could go get it at the grocery store. Duh!” – they don’t think that the grocery store only has a couple of days of food and, in a crisis, less than that. People, they buy a lot more than they usually would cause they’re stocking up, so the grocery store can run out very quickly. That myth, it’s one of those invisible myths. It’s easy for people to believe that food is always abundant and always in supply. When in fact it’s nothing like that at all. Don’t fall for that myth. Here’s another myth. It’s a really important one. This comes down to sick people who manage their diseases with medications. This is what most Westerners – Americans and Canadians, and so on – have been taught by their drug-pimping doctors, who are Big Pharma prostitutes. They’ve been taught that you don’t need to eat healthy. All you need to do is take these pills, manage your high blood pressure with these pills and manage your blood sugar swings with these diabetes medications. Instead of the doctor telling people, “Hey, maybe you should stop eating cookies and ice cream and muffins all day.” Just a spoonful of sugar, right? Well, wasn’t that a song from the Sound of Music? It helps the medicine go down, doesn’t it? But people are eating spoonfuls of sugar. The Sound of Music wasn’t supposed to be an instruction manual on diet. People are eating spoonfuls of sugar and wonder why they have diabetes. The doctor should’ve been telling them, “Hey, stop eating like a five-year-old, you’re an adult. Apply some adult logic to this here, eat for nourishment, not entertainment.” But doctors aren’t doing that for the most part. Instead, they’re saying, “Oh, eat whatever you want. Keep chugging down that sugar, and then here, just take these pills, these blood sugar pills, these high blood pressure pills, these heart pills, these statin drug pills, whatever.” Then, because the food makes you all depressed and everything, they go, “Oh, here take these antidepressant pills, too. Yes, they’d be good for you,” even though the antidepressants actually cause blood sugar swings and promote diabetes. Then the diabetes drugs cause liver disorders, the liver drugs cause cancer, the cancer drugs cause heart damage and Alzheimer’s, and the Alzheimer’s drugs have side effects. It’s just this crazy circle. Well, guess what, folks? That’s not going to work in a collapse because the pharmacies probably don’t exist anymore. You’re not going to be able to manage your crappy diet with a bunch of pills from the pharmacy if, in fact, you happen to be eating a crappy diet. NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 27"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"This is the time to think about, “Hey, how could I safely and reasonably stop relying on medication to manage symptoms that are caused by the garbage foods I’m eating?” You should start thinking about how you could eat in a more wholesome way that would alleviate the need for these toxic medications, which won’t be available in a collapse. Maybe, ask your doctor, who might be offended by it because he’s getting kickbacks from the drug companies for all the prescriptions that he writes. You might ask your doctor, “Hey doc, how could I get off these blood pressure drugs and blood sugar drugs, all these drugs?” The doctor, if he or she is honest, will say, “Oh, glad you asked. Have you heard about healthy eating?” Some doctors are now educated in that area – shockingly, even though there’s no profit in it. They don’t get kickbacks when you go to the grocery store and purchase fresh produce and eat healthy. They get kickbacks from Big Pharma for prescribing drugs for sickness and disease. That’s what they tend to promote. If you go out of your way and ask them, “Hey, how can I live a healthier life?” They may be able to help you do that. If not, just read my website, NaturalNews.com. It’s like 15 years’ worth of articles about how to be healthy, and it’s all free. It’s super easy. Just remember food should be your medicine. This is the fundamental principle of what I’ve been teaching for decades now. Food should be your medicine, especially in a collapsed scenario because you don’t really have much of a choice. Did you know that you can reverse Type two diabetes? Did you know it’s not a disease that stays with you forever? You can reverse it! Yes, in most cases – maybe not all cases, if it’s very advanced – you can reverse high blood pressure. You can reverse cardiovascular disease in many cases. You can reverse cancer by eating anti-cancer foods. It turns out that anti-cancer foods are the ones that you should be storing anyway, like sprouting seeds. When you raise sprouts and eat sprouts, all sprouts have anti-cancer nutrients in them. Yes, that’s pretty cool. You might actually get healthier in a collapse. A lot of people will. I mean, the ones that don’t die. The ones that managed to survive on more natural, unprocessed foods, they will get a lot healthier. This was observed in World War II. A lot of Europeans were being bombed, and they were living in tough times. Their obesity risk went down for all the obvious reasons. They were starving or fasting. It turns out, many people who were diseased with diabetes and heart disease and so on in the 1930s were no longer diseased, if they were able to survive the bombing of the Germans. The Allies actually bombed German cities and so on. A lot of bombing going on, a lot of starvation going on, a lot of food shortages, and turns out, a lot of people got healthier. I know, it’s crazy, right? A little crazy chapter of history. I’m not recommending it, but this is what happens when people don’t have access to their garbage processed foods and spoonfuls of sugar.

Have you ever seen people at the grocery store using a lot of coupons and they think they’re saving money? They’ve got like a pocket full of coupons.

It’s just like processed corn, processed wheat, processed flour, processed sugar and processed cereal. Then they slap down their coupons and it’s like double-coupon day, and all the dollars start coming off a cash register. In their minds, they think, “Oh my gosh, I am making money on this.” They think that they are cashing in, as if the food company is paying them to eat their stuff. No, the joke is on you. You’re still getting ripped off because the food that has coupons for it, by and large, is the crappiest, most nutritionally worthless food imaginable. It’s garbage. It’s empty calories. I never use coupons because nothing I buy ever has a coupon. Not that I even have time to mess with clipping coupons or whatever, but the things that I buy is fresh produce, there’s no coupons for that. There’re no coupons for turmeric root. There’re no coupons for healthy stuff. Why? Because the margins are lower. What are their coupons for? Oh, a sugar bomb pops for children, breakfast cereal made out of nothing but like popped air with sugar coating on it or something. That’s what the coupons are for. People think that cheap food is a bargain, but it isn’t. It’s a rip-off. You’re getting ripped off. You know why? Because if your food is cheap, your medical costs are going to be expensive. Cheap food means expensive healthcare. But when you consume expensive food, i.e., organic food, nutritious food, whole foods – I don’t mean the company, I mean wholesome foods – your long-term health care costs are very, very low. You can buy a lot of organic food for the price of one half-a-million-dollar cancer chemotherapy course. It’s amazing to me. People think it’s a bargain. “I saved 50 cents on cereal,” and then 20 years later, they have a cancer treatment bill that’s $700,000. Somehow, they think they got a good deal. No, you got ripped off and you hurt yourself in the process. You thought you were saving money. You were just committing nutritional suicide, is really what was happening. You were making money for the drug companies and the cancer clinics and the open-heart surgeons and the vegetable oil companies, and all those organizations that don’t have your best interests at heart. If you’re buying cheap food, it’s going to have a very expensive, long-term effect. Let’s get into storable food, emergency food and survival food. A lot of companies online selling survival food, they say, “Oh here, a one-year supply for $600, or a 90-day supply for $99.” You’re like, “Wow! Ninety days of food for $99” or whatever they’re offering. If you ever look at the ingredients of what they’re selling, it’s not even as good as prison food. It’s the lowest-grade garbage food that still barely qualifies for human consumption. It’s genetically modified cheap grains, soy, partially hydrogenated, garbage canola oil and corn oil-type of stuff. It’s just refined grains and refined, bleached white flour – nutritionally devoid – and a spoonful of sugar, salt, MSG and yeast extract, which is a hidden form of MSG. Most of this food, the so-called “storable food” out there is pure garbage. It’s just empty calories with salt and MSG and sugar and some artificial fake cream sauce made out of genetically modified corn maltodextrin with guar gum in it. “Oh, look at the creamy chicken soup base.” No, it’s basically just chemicals and gum. It’s nasty. People buy that and they think they’ve got “food” for one year. No, you don’t. You don’t even have fertilizer. You have like byproducts of the food processing industry with salt and sugar and MSG in it. People don’t read ingredients for some reason. I’ve always found that amazing. People who shop at the grocery store, they don’t read what’s in products because they’d be shocked. People take a vaccine shot; they don’t read what’s in it. That’s crazy. Why would you inject yourself with something without knowing what’s in it? NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 29"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"If you’re a drug user and you’re buying heroin off the street, there’s no ingredients list that comes with heroin. If there were, it would probably say: “Extracted with gasoline, made out of genetically modified puppies via slave labor in China and South America or whatever.” It would be the most insane, crazy stuff with sulfuric acid. Drug users don’t care what they inject because they’re not health conscious people by definition. If you’re not some heroin addict, you should read food labels. You should care what you’re swallowing. After all, it’s passing through your body in kind of an intimate way, more intimate than sex. This food stays in your body for days. It goes from end to end. You don’t want to know what it is? Same thing with vaccines. You’re injecting that into your tissue and it goes into your bloodstream. Don’t you want to know what chemicals are in that thing? What viral strains? What little fragments of DNA are in there? What animal organs are ground up and used in that, or aborted human fetal tissue that’s been cloned, which is one of the most common ingredients in vaccines? You inject yourself with dead baby parts, folks. People will be like “Who cares, doctor said, get my flu shot.” The flu shot doesn’t even work. People who get flu shots are the same people who catch the flu. Almost every year, they catch the flu. “I don’t understand it, I got my flu shot but I still got the flu,” and the doctor will tell them, “Good thing you got your flu shot or your flu would have been worse.” That’s insane. You caught the flu because your flu shot doesn’t work, and those people also tend to eat like crap. Have you ever noticed that the people who get flu shots all the time, they’re the same people who are using coupons at the grocery store to buy just nutritionally depleted, toxic food and thinking, “I’m getting a great deal”? No, you’re getting ripped off. Storable food. You really need to look at the ingredients. There’s a lot of deception in the storable foods industry, where a lot of these companies are saying, “Oh, it’s all non-GMO.” No, it isn’t. You’re lying. It’s almost all-GMO, unless it’s certified organic – USDA organic. It’s probably GMO because almost everything that the storable foods industry does is rooted in the cheapest, lowest cost, bulk-processed, garbage wheat flour, corn derivatives, maltodextrin, corn syrup solids, artificial colors, artificial flavors and, again, salt, sugar and MSG. That’s pretty much what it is, a textured vegetable protein from genetically modified soybeans grown in Brazil after they stripped the rainforest away and turned the land into a toxic stew of chemicals for Monsanto. This is what you’re eating in the storable foods industry. You’re not saving your life; you’re committing suicide with that stuff. It shouldn’t even be called survival food because, by definition, it should help you survive. This stuff should just be called death food. I’ve even done some articles on that listing. For example, the top 10 ingredients that are found in these so-called survival foods that you might want to avoid. Some of them contain aluminum. Some of them contain heart disease- promoting trans fats. A lot of them contain cancer-causing chemicals like sodium nitrite, which, I forgot to mention, is also found in most canned soups that contain any kind of meat, like ham and potato soup. If you read the ingredients, there’s sodium nitrite in ham, and that stuff causes cancer. It’s the cancer- causing chemical in processed meat. It’s the reason processed meat gives children brain tumors. Sodium nitrite’s right there on the label for ham and cheese and ham and potato. It’s in pepperoni, frozen pizza, and beef jerky. It’s in all kinds of lunch meats, and people don’t even read. It’s like when people go shopping, they revert to the intelligence of a kindergartner.

People who are attorneys, they’re in the courtroom during the day arguing law and the constitutionality of the judge – high IQ arguments citing constitutional law, everything. They’re brilliant, genius adults. Then they go to the grocery store and they’re like, “I want spoonful of sugar.” Their entire higher brain function just gets nullified the minute they walk through the door. They’re just eating cancer and diabetes and heart disease and Alzheimer’s. These are people who are like the top of their class. Even doctors, even brain surgeons, they’ll do surgery on your brain during the day, and then they’ll swing by the grocery store and buy hot dogs with processed garbage meat, pink slime with sodium nitrite in it that causes cancer and damages brain function. They’ll eat that and they’ll feed it to their kids. What’s wrong with people? They’ll buy survival food without reading the ingredients. “Well the picture looks good, it looked like macaroni and cheese.” They buy food the way a seven-year-old reads a comic book. “The pictures are good.” It’s just amazing to me how people can be so smart and have PhD’s – a PhD in organic chemistry – or be an astrobiology expert who understands the origin of microbial life on Mars, and then they go to the grocery store and they’re freaking morons just buying death. But that’s the way people are. Nutritional illiteracy is so common in America today. That’s kind of why I’m recording this, because I don’t want people to be nutritionally illiterate. I want people to be informed and make good decisions as adults, which means read the labels. Speaking of storable food, let’s talk about shelf life here for a second. When you take whole grains like wheat, corn, oats or legumes – in their whole form, they have a very long shelf life, like 10 or 20 years, if you keep them cool. When you grind them up and you make things like pasta, or you make like rice flour or something like that, then the shelf life just plummets to typically two to three years. A lot of these stored foods that are these kinds of ready-to-cook meals, they don’t have a very long shelf life. The food companies that promote these things typically lie about the shelf life. They say it’s 20 to 25 years, but that is just a blatant, flat-out lie. It’s a marketing lie that they all use now because their competitors are using the same lie. They figured they have to lie as much as their competitors are lying in order to sell their products. Most of them just agreed to lie. The consumers out there think, “Oh my gosh, this is all non-GMO, and it’s good for 25 years.” Actually, it’s full of GMOs and it’s good for two years. Imagine their shock five years down the road, when they open up those packs and they’re like, “This isn’t even food anymore. It’s full of webs and things. It’s all rancid and blackish. Something’s gone wrong in here.” It’s not macaroni and cheese anymore. It’s like crap- o-roni and garbage. I don’t know what it is. See if the garbage disposal will take care of this stuff. The Food-a-Rac-a-Cycle machine there in the kitchen, see if that might be able to handle it. People are buying food that is not going to last very long. Then there’s the whole calories question. Long-term storable food supplies are usually measured by calories. It’s like, “Oh, here’s a one-year supply, three meals a day for a year, for a person, and it’s $6.99 or whatever.” Number one, if you do the math on these, some of these companies have a meal that has only 350 calories. If you think you can live on a thousand calories a day, that would be a year of starvation. That would be the worst year of your life, trust me. A thousand calories a day? I think I’ve burned a thousand calories just sleeping at night. You’re going to need thousands of calories. You’ll become skin and bones on a thousand calories a day. Even if you’re not a big person, you’ll look like you’ve been living in a Nazi concentration camp if you’re living on a thousand calories a day for some extended period of time. This is not a sustainable amount of food, yet some of these companies will say that’s a one-year supply. Okay. A year of hell. Another thing is, are all calories equivalent? Guess what adds calories to these meals? Spoonful of sugar. They sugar up the soup mixes and sugar up the pasta. They sugar up everything. They’re just adding calories NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 31"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"because sugar is like the cheapest source of calories that can be added to stored foods. And that’s how they’ll get to the one-year calorie count or whatever they’re targeting. Just by throwing in loads of sugar or maltodextrin, cheap corn derivatives and cheap white flour. Just garbage upon garbage. They say, “Yes, this is survival food for a year. It’s going to give this many calories. Maybe some of them will give, say, 2200 calories a day?” Yes, but what kind of calories? If it’s calories from sugar and garbage, is that really going to keep you alive? You need calories from healthy fats, from nuts and seeds, for example. You need protein calories. You need calories from plants that have natural medicine in them, such as beans and lentils, vegetables and fruits, and dried onion and garlic, broccoli, all these things. You need calories from a wide spectrum of food. You need to eat the rainbow, and this is not a pro-LGBT statement. You need to eat the rainbow, get your purple eggplants in there, too. Get your red tomatoes, your green veggies, your yellow squash and onions. Eat all the different colors. You know why? Because those colors are medicines. They prevent diabetes. They prevent cancer. They prevent heart disease. If all your food looks like just some bland, slightly off-white powder with some artificial yellow and red coloring thrown in it, that’s not survival food, that’s death food. That’s what people are buying. Calories don’t help you much if it’s calories from garbage. I guess you could just go dumpster diving and find calories. There’s plenty of calories in the dumpster. There are calories everywhere. There are calories in wood bark, but do you really want to be chewing on wood bark? Back in the Great Depression, 1929 and so on, people who were starving, you know what they would chew on? Shoelaces, because they were leather. Chew on leather, fill your belly. Are those calories? Probably so, according to today’s storable foods companies. But that doesn’t mean you want to live on that stuff. You could eat cardboard and have calories – some people actually do, I think. It’s probably some new Hollywood, 48-hour cardboard diet. That doesn’t mean its real food, and it’s not going to keep you alive. My job is to keep you not just slightly alive, but healthy, with high performance, high cognitive function, high immune function, and with an ability to heal, perform and recover from exertion, injuries and stress. You’re not going to be able to do those things on processed garbage wheat and corn, MSG, genetically modified soy and maltodextrin, all these things. I know I’m just about done with this point, because I’ve said the same thing 10 different ways here. I get it. It’s just that people continue to do this every day. They continue to go out and buy the most toxic garbage food either in the grocery store or storable foods. Then when it comes to an actual SHTF scenario, they’re going to be scratching their heads and saying, “Well, gosh, why are we not feeling nourished on this storable food?” Because it’s not food, folks. Don’t let that be you. Don’t make that mistake of being 30 days into some food crisis or some new global war going on or some grid down scenario with Chinese troops parachuting out of the sky into your city, and you open the closet and say, “Yes, didn’t we buy a one-year supply?” Then you look in there and it’s really only a six- months supply of garbage. “Oh man, what are we going to eat? Shoelaces. Mmm, those delicious shoelaces, Nike-flavored.” You can always resort to that if you don’t plan ahead. One final thought here. One of the ways that these food companies achieve any kind of a shelf life at all is they make their foods so toxic, that even bugs won’t eat it. It’s just full of salt and chemicals and MSG and artificial colors, to the point where even bugs and insects are like, “What is this stuff?” They’re beetles and bugs, but they would rather eat cow turds than a lot of stored food that’s sold out there today. Cow turds actually have nourishment in them. I’m not trying to be gross, but it’s true. I’ve got donkeys on my farm, and every once in a while, my dogs will run up to a donkey turd and just swallow that sucker. Yes, they’re really into that. It’s like a free donkey turd buffet day. I got to tell you, those dogs would not touch most of the stored food that is sold on the market today, the non-organic, cheap, processed crap. They would rather eat donkey turds, because at least donkey turds smell like real food and because it was real food. NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 32"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Think about it: Donkey turds are fermented wheatgrass that’s already been juiced. It’s the byproduct of fermented wheatgrass juicing, that’s what donkey turds are. The dogs walk up there and are like, “Wow, this is superfood.” I’m like, “Please don’t lick me after you do that, please, come on. You’ve had enough turd for today.” You might think, gosh, maybe I’m not feeding my dogs enough or something. No, trust me, they’re well-fed with organic, high-end dog food with superfoods, with like ground-up seaweed powder, all kinds of stuff. They are the most well-nourished dogs that you could imagine. Then they still do like a drive-by munching of a donkey turd when we’re on a walk. They would not eat the storable foods that most humans are buying out there, because it’s not food. Sometimes animals actually have more sense than humans on these things – a lot of times. I don’t know if you’ve seen any of these videos before, but if you go buy these frozen ice cream sandwiches, as they’re called, they have like a chocolate wafer on top and at the bottom and then the so-called ice cream in-between the wafers. You take these things that you buy at the grocery store and you put them out on a hot summer day; you’re in Phoenix, Arizona and the sun is shining, and the temperature is at a hundred degrees, but guess what? That ice cream sandwich won’t melt. That’s right, it won’t melt. You know why? Because it’s not ice cream. You put a tub of margarine out, ants won’t eat it. You know why? Because it’s not real food. It’s fake food. It’s not real butter. You put it outside, and animals won’t touch it because animals have more wisdom than most human shoppers. These animals are eating donkey turds. It would actually be a step up for a lot of shoppers to have donkey turds. Maybe we could offer freeze-dried donkey turds with coupons to convince people that they’re a bargain. I know where I can find some. In fact, I’m living on a donkey turd factory right now and I don’t even have to pay a royalty to the producers. They’re making them for free every day. Just follow them around with like a butterfly net or something. Freeze-dried fermented superfood, that would be the label today. You’d see it on the shelf of Whole Foods: “Freeze-dried, super-fermented, double-masticated, wild crafted superfood with probiotics.” Don’t forget the probiotics, that would be on the label, too. “500 strains of probiotics. Ten billion CFU count.” And people would buy that stuff, seriously. That’s how crazy the supplements industry is, too. You wouldn’t believe how many supplements come from just waste products. It’s crazy out there. That’s about it for the myths of nutrition, which is what I wanted to cover here in chapter two. For the next chapter, we’re going to get into more about food, about different ways to store food and different ways that foods are dried, so that you understand the nutritional differences between those foods. It’s all about food in the next chapter. I covered a little bit of that already, but we’ll get into more detail in the next chapter. You are listening to Survival Nutrition. I hope you’re learning some things and that you don’t get too offended by my lame attempts at comedy, but I’m not even making this up about the donkey turds; that’s all true, totally true.

This is all about food, which seems funny because we’ve been talking about food most of the time; but this is a real focus on food. We’ll start with this idea of different ways to preserve food, so that when you’re purchasing food for survival or long-term storage, you’ll have a good idea about the nutritive value of foods based on how well they’ve been preserved. Number one, there’s spray-dried food. Spray drying is a kind of flash-heat, air drying method that uses a really large vortex, like a big metal cylinder and a carrier. You can spray dry liquids that are then vortexed around with some kind of carrier, which is sometimes maltodextrin or something like that. It creates a powder that falls to the bottom of the vortex. Spray drying introduces a lot of oxidation into foods. Spray-dried foods are heavily oxidized, and they’re also heated to some extent but not quite cooked. Spray drying is often used to turn liquid herbal extracts into powders, and it’s perfectly fine in that context. There’s nothing wrong with it at all. When you think about spray-dried tomato powder, for example, understand that it doesn’t have quite the nutritional value of raw tomato juice or raw tomatoes themselves. Powdered milk is spray-dried milk. The entire milk industry is all into spray drying. If you’ve ever made powdered milk, you’ll understand that there’s no fat in it. It’s just low-fat or non-fat, spray-dried powdered milk. It tastes like there’s no fat in it because you can’t spray dry fats or they’ll just go rancid. They’ll oxidize very quickly. That’s the technology. That’s why you don’t have spray-dried whole milk; it would taste nasty. I know there are companies out there that are trying to make things like spray-dried avocado slurry and things like that, and the results are not good. Spray drying is not really the best way to have things dried. Freeze drying is, by far, the best way. Freeze drying actually means that it’s using a vacuum. It’s lowering the temperature of the foods and then using a vacuum to sublimate ice crystals out of the food. Through this method, the foods are well-preserved, including their medicinal molecules. Freeze drying is really great for fruits and vegetables, but not so much for foods with fats or even carbohydrates. You just add water to freeze-dried food and it reconstitutes. Freeze-dried blueberries have all the nutritional value of blueberries. Freeze-dried green beans are almost exactly like regular green beans. Freeze drying is a great way to preserve foods that have high nutritional content, such as broccoli, oranges or mangoes. The one thing that’s missing from most people’s storable foods is, in fact, fruits. You know, sailors back in the 15th century or so, they would get scurvy from sailing around on ships because they didn’t have any fruit. They had vitamin C deficiencies, which causes scurvy. They had plenty of vitamin D because they had sunlight, but they didn’t have any vitamin C, so they had scurvy. They were living on salted meats, like salted beef jerky. They had health problems because of the lack of vitamin C and the lack of fruits. NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 34"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"When they discovered that they could carry limes on board and they could eat limes, that’s how they got the name limeys. If you ate limes, then you wouldn’t get scurvy, because you got vitamin C from the limes. Human bodies can’t manufacture their own vitamin C, even though dogs and other animals do. Did you know that? That’s why you don’t have to feed dogs vitamin C, and that’s why dogs aren’t into eating lemons. Humans love the taste of citrus fruit. After all, we have a natural appetite for vitamin C because we need it in our bodies. It’s the thing that’s lacking in most storable foods. There are people out there buying what they think is a one-year food supply, and I know I’ve already covered the calories and the garbage processed food that are in most of those products. But think about this, where are the fruits? Where are the fruits? Where’s the vitamin C in that one-year food supply? It’s nowhere to be found. You either need to store vitamin C as a supplement alongside your stored foods, or you need to store some foods that naturally contain vitamin C, such as freeze- dried fruits. Now this isn’t some infomercial, but the Health Ranger Store that’s at HealthRangerStore. com sells freeze-dried certified organic fruits and vegetables in either many buckets or in #10 sealed cans for long-term storage. The only reason I mentioned that is because we’re just one of the very few storable foods providers in the world that offers storable foods with lab testing. We lab test everything that we sell at the Health Ranger Store. We have a multimillion-dollar laboratory called CWC Labs. We do testing for microbiology, E. coli, salmonella, yeast and mold. We test for heavy metals using a mass spec instrument called an ICP-MS. We test for glyphosate and are, right now, investing in additional instrumentation, some genetic sequencing equipment. We’ll soon be able to do our own in-house GMO testing and PCR gene testing for dangerous microbes, so we’ll have a couple of different ways to test for microbes in food. That’s why we’ve never had to recall food because we do all this testing. Whereas a lot of other companies, they’ll make peanut butter with E. coli in it and kill five people. Then the FDA will force them to issue a recall. This makes you wonder how come they don’t test their own peanut butter for E. coli because it’s not that crazy expensive to get just a microbiology testing instrument. You can get those for less than $50,000, which is not that much money for the food science industry. Our mass spec instruments are worth $400,000 each. For just 50 thousand, you can do E. coli testing and salmonella testing, but they still don’t do that. They’ll sell peanut butter that’s all contaminated, or apple sauce with E. coli in it, or fresh salad greens contaminated with salmonella or E. coli and then people die. It always struck me as odd because E. coli comes from your digestive tract. Basically – and pardon my use of some words here – somebody shat on the salad greens. That’s the only way that E. coli gets into these foods. They’re using some kind of feces outflow, either from a cattle ranch or human sewage. Then you realize, oh my gosh, in California, they irrigate the vegetables and the fruits, the nuts and the avocados, everything with reclaimed sewage water, which is full of what? Oh, E. coli. They’re irrigating the food crops with E. coli water. It’s kind of like an E. coli tea. That’s what’s sprayed on the vegetables. It’s like biosludge irrigation. Then those vegetables go into the grocery stores. If you’ve ever wondered why you should grow your own food, let this be a lesson. I bet you that when you grow your own lettuce greens in your own garden, you don’t shit on them. If you do, shame on you. But when you get them commercially grown, guess what? Yes, that’s what’s on them, sewage water. You’ve got to do the lab testing for all this stuff in order to make sure you’re not selling E. coli- contaminated products. As you’ve seen time and time again, spinach with E. coli ends up getting recalled, or hamburger meat full of some contaminant. It’s like, how come these food companies don’t test anything? I don’t understand that. Why aren’t they testing anything? HealthRangerStore.com/SurvivalDriedFruits NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 35"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"In addition to freeze-dried products, there are, of course, pickled products, which are really great for long-term storage. Actual pickles, which are just cucumbers in salt brine with herbs like dill – those can last for many years, especially in glass jars, as long as they have a low sugar content. The more sugar you put in your pickling recipes, the more that’s got to ferment and turn into vinegar and get nasty. Keep the sugar content really low. If the salt content is actually very high for pickling, then those products will last a lot longer. Now let’s talk about cured, or salted, and smoked foods. Meats typically, as well as fish, can be cured. The problem is that the curing agent that most people or companies use is sodium nitrite, which is a toxic cancer-causing chemical. Don’t cure meats with sodium nitrite, unless you just enjoy committing culinary suicide, because that’s what that is. You’re just eating cancer. That’s not a healthy way to survive anything. If you do eat cured meat, or if you cure meats yourself, don’t use sodium nitrite. You can use salt. You can do salt-curing. I don’t know what other ingredients can be used as a replacement for sodium nitrite, but there are some. You may have to do a little research and find out for yourself. I’m sorry, I’m not into curing meats because frankly, I’m just not into that much meat-eating. I will enjoy a Texas barbecue brisket once every couple of months or something, but I’m not a daily meat eater myself. Although in a survival situation, I would definitely be happy to eat more meat; it’s just I wouldn’t want it with sodium nitrate on it. Now let’s talk about smoked meats because you can build a smokehouse, and smoking is a great preservation method. This is something that has been used for centuries. The American pioneers did a lot of smoking and salting of meats. In fact – I forgot to mention – when it comes to salt-curing, it’s important to have lots of extra salt. Right now, salt is very easy to get at the grocery store. It’s dirt cheap and readily available. But in a collapsed scenario, salt can become very scarce very quickly because salt has so many uses. In chemistry, it has uses in first aid. It has uses in cooking, preservation and other things. Because of that, salt would be hard to find in certain areas, unless you happen to live near a salt mine or some kind of a salt supply that’s providing salt to you. The thing to know about salt is that it stores forever – I mean, millions of years. We import Himalayan salt from Pakistan. This is one of the products that we sell at the Health Ranger Store. It’s this pink crystal, Himalayan salt. Sometimes we get it in course, little nugget shapes; other times, we get it finely ground into a typical free-flowing salt – powder, basically. We also buy salt lamps, which are great. They’re made of the exact same stuff, and they’re shaped like a lamp. You can actually take a salt lamp and just shave off the salt into your soup. It’s the same salt; it’s sodium chloride. What gives it the pink color are just the different minerals in it. The reason why Himalayan salt is the best salt in the world is that it was formed millions of years ago, before modern-day pollution. It used to be ocean that was underneath the mountains in the Himalayas. When it was ocean, it was pristine ocean because the world didn’t have microplastics at that time. If you go out today and you buy sea salt, sea salt is harvested from the ocean. The ocean is full of toxic plastics and pollution; toxic chemicals and heavy metals. Right now, sea salt is full of pollutants, whereas Himalayan salt is pollution-free. The salt mines that are deep underground, I think those are relatively pollution- free as well. Today, I wouldn’t eat sea salt at all. It’s full of plastic, and there have been many stories about that that we’ve covered over the last couple of years. The shocking amounts of microplastics in sea salt, that is. Sea salt is harvested out of the ocean, which is full of trash. It’s a sad statement about our world today. You can’t even trust salt out of the ocean anymore because China and India are dumping all their raw trash into the ocean. They’re the worst polluters of the oceans, by the way, not the United States. China is the worst. NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 36"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"It’s good to have a very large supply of salt. It is dirt cheap to buy right now. It also stores forever, as long as you keep it dry. Remember that salt is hydrophilic, which means it attracts water. It loves water. If you leave salt open in any environment where there’s any humidity in the air, it will act as a moisture absorber. Moisture will turn that salt into more of a kind of slurry, and then salt water will drip out of the bottom of that salt container you have it in. Salt will just pull water out of the air and ruin your salt. Salt is highly corrosive, so don’t store it on a metal shelf, as I accidentally did one time. I put some salt lamps on some metal shelves and forgot about them for a couple years. When I came back, the metal beneath the salt lamps had rusted because they had pulled in the humidity and dripped salt water on the metal, corroding it. It’s the chloride that does that, sodium chloride. Chloride is a very powerful element that eats things, including metal. When you store salt, make sure it’s in an airtight, waterproof container. I love the five-gallon pails, or you can get three-and-a-half-gallon pails or buckets. They’re usually just white buckets with an airtight lid that you hammer on with a mallet. You can put a lot of salt in a bucket because salt is dense like rocks. It’s a special kind of rock, and it will store for your lifetime and way beyond that. I may have mentioned this in previous podcasts, but because we import salt at the Health Ranger Store, we get damaged products that didn’t survive the ocean trip very well. Sometimes we get like big 75-pound bags of Himalayan salt and fine, ground Himalayan salt and salt lamps that are broken. I am sitting on thousands of pounds at my ranch, thousands of pounds of salt products, Himalayan salt, salt lamps, coarse grain and fine grain salt. I’ve got bags of salt that have turned into a solid chunk; they are now just one big rock that’s shaped like a plastic bag. You have to peel the plastic off of it, and it’s just like this pink salt rock underneath. It is perfectly good. I would eat that salt. I just can’t sell it because, well, it absorbed too much moisture and some of it’s been sitting in my barn for a few years. I would eat it, but I can’t sell it. I wouldn’t sell it to anybody. It’s no longer sanitary. In a barter situation, I could absolutely barter it with someone and just tell them where it came from, what it is, full transparency. Would people want that salt? You bet they would, especially going into a soup or something that you’re cooking. Everybody needs salt or you die. You’ve got to have salt. In normal times, people will have too much salt. But in collapse scenarios, people won’t have enough salt. I won’t have that problem for the reasons I just explained. I will probably just share a lot of salt with a lot of people. Just take a load of salt down to the local church and just donate it out to people. “Who needs salt? We’ve got a salt mine here in the middle of Texas. It’s all from Pakistan, but for whatever reason, I’ve ended up with thousands of pounds of salt”. Cattle needs salt, too. Ranch animals have salt licks. Why? Because they’re not getting enough salt out of the grass and the other things they’re eating. Animals need salt supplements. If humans didn’t have so much salt in the processed food that they ate, they would need salt supplements, too. Salt is an absolute necessity. That’s why I say buy salt, even just regular table salt or just cheap salt at the grocery store. The problem with Morton Salt, which I think is the common brand out there, is that this iodized salt is not in an airtight and waterproof container. It’s just in some kind of cardboard container, so that’s not really a good way to store salt. You could buy a bunch of those, pour the salt into a bucket or a pail, pound that sucker close and store it in an air-conditioned, cool place. That might work. HealthRangerStore.com/SurvivalSalt NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 37"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"There’s probably a cheaper way to get salt that will last long than that. Shop around, just see what you can find. We sell salt at the Health Ranger Store, but it’s not the most affordable salt. Half of the reason for that is because the shipping cost is so high because it’s just heavy. We get charged for that by the carriers, UPS and so on. They all raised their prices when the fuel prices went up, and then when fuel became dirt cheap because of COVID, they never lowered their prices. Then they just raised their prices again saying, “Oh well, there’s a virus now.” Like, what does a virus have to do with your shipping costs? They just keep raising it. They’re doing a good job; I’m not complaining about UPS here. They do a good job delivering our packages, but it costs us a lot to ship salt, so we’re probably not the best source for that. It might not be a bad idea to go online and purchase a hard copy book about how to salt-cure foods or how to use salt for meat preservation and so on, because our pioneers survived on salted ham, salted beef and beef jerky. If you have a food dehydrator, some salt and some meat, you basically got it made. You soak the meat in brine, a salt brine with maybe some pepper and some spices in it, and put a little cayenne in it, if you want some punch in there. After a couple of days of soaking it in there, you put it in the food dehydrator and you dry it. Now you have salted meat that frankly needs no refrigeration. The reason for this gets down to microbiology. Microbes can’t grow in highly salty environments, especially if they’re dry. It’s a good idea to still package salt-cured foods in a plastic bag; maybe you could do a little vacuum packing. It’ll keep the microbes out and keep the water out. Maybe you have one of those vacuum saver devices. You can use your Excalibur food dehydrator. You can make your own jerky, but load it up with salt if it’s for survival purposes. The more salt, the better. The salt is going to be the preservative. The salt is going to give you salt that you need from a dietary perspective that you may not be able to get in the future. This is where it’s important to point out that a lot of people have the wrong attitude about this because they’re used to making beef jerky during normal times. They’ll do things like making low- sodium beef jerky. That’s great in 2019, but this is 2020 and everything’s about to collapse. You want high-salt beef jerky because you need the extra salt. The more salt, the better. It should be like chewing on a beef-flavored salt bar. You’re going to need a lot of salt when you’re working on the farm all day and sweating, and you don’t have all these processed salty foods that you normally eat. Salt is necessary, and it works for preservation. Getting back to smoking meats. You can build a smokehouse. You can build a little smoking platform. It’s not even very difficult, just a few cinder blocks. You can go online and look at this, I’m not going to give you blueprints right here. Go on YouTube, look up how to build a smokehouse, or how to build a smoking cinder block pit. You can start a fire there, douse the flames and just get it smoking. Then what you’re doing is just bathing the meat in the smoke. In the old pioneer days, they would have a smokehouse. The whole point was to have meat hanging in the smokehouse, and the smoke would just penetrate the meat and kill all the bacteria. This is basically a way to sanitize the meat and stop the bacteria from eating it. It would also preserve the meat and add some flavor, as well. The thing to understand about smoked meats is that smoke is a carcinogen, but there’s a way to counteract it. If you just eat a lot of smoked meats all day every day, you’ll be consuming a lot of cancer-causing chemicals in the smoke. You’d also give yourself cancer over time, especially colon cancer. If you take vitamin C or eat freeze-dried fruits with smoked meat, you will counteract the cancer-causing carcinogens in the smoke. An important rule in all of this is if you eat smoked meats, make sure you take vitamin C. How much? A lot! Like, any meal where I was eating smoked meat, I would take at least a gram of vitamin C with that meal. If you’re drinking blueberry juice or eating strawberries, or having oranges or limes, you won’t necessarily need to supplement with vitamin C. If you had a meal that was smoked beef jerky with a side dish of some cilantro and cabbage salad with lime juice in it, guess what? You’ve just counteracted the cancer- causing effects of the smoked meat. NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 38"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Barbecue is mostly smoking meat. Barbecuing meat is not the art of burning meat to a crisp. That’s not what this is about. It’s about smoking meat for a long period of time. That’s how the flavor goes in. A good barbecue is a slow smoking process. When you eat barbecue, guess what you should eat with it? Vitamin C, fruits, oranges, limes, grapefruit, etc. It’s going to counteract the cancer-causing effects of that. It turns out that raw cabbage, which is one of the main ingredients in coleslaw, also counteracts barbecue toxins. Guess what is served traditionally with barbecued meat? Oh, coleslaw. It’s raw cabbage, which has anti-cancer nutrients in it that prevent stomach cancer. You’ll actually find those in a lot of the traditional dishes in American cuisine, as well as other forms of cuisine around the world. There are complementary food constituents that assist each other in allowing your body to be protected from possible toxins that are found in certain foods. This is also why it’s important to have fruit and fiber with every meal, even in a survival situation, because you don’t want to be constipated when the power grid goes down, and United Nations troops are flowing across the border and trying to seize your town. You need to have good digestion even in a survival scenario. That means getting fruit and fiber with every meal, which will also counteract the toxic effects of smoked meats or any other toxins that are created through cooking. For example, acrylamides are cancer-causing chemicals that are created by burning carbohydrates. When you cook a loaf of bread, the outer shell of the bread, the crust – it’s brown, right? That brown contains acrylamides, and those are cancer-causing chemicals. If you eat really burned toast, you’re getting a lot of cancer-causing chemicals. Guess how you counteract that? Oh, with vitamin C, fiber, fruits and vegetables. Even in the morning, if you’re eating pancakes, they’re browned slightly; and other cooked cakes, they have acrylamides in them. But with your breakfast, you should have some fresh fruit, maybe some fresh orange juice, maybe half a grapefruit to counteract the cancer-causing chemicals. This is advice that applies to everything, not just a survival situation. You want to make sure that you’re not poisoning yourself with your food every day. Since a lot of us will end up eating smoked foods, salted foods, pickled foods and dried foods, we need to understand what that means from a chemistry point of view and how to counteract that. That’s why I say storing fruit, freeze-dried fruit, is the missing gap in most people’s food preparedness plans. Sometimes a lot of these one-year supply companies, they’ll offer an orange drink mix and you think, “Oh, good, there must be oranges in there.” No, there aren’t. There’s nothing in there from an orange. There’s not even an orange flavor from an orange. It’s just artificial chemicals. It’s just sugar water with some color and some synthetic orange flavor. Nothing in there is from an orange. Don’t think that that counts as a fruit because it doesn’t. Also, remember, you can just store vitamin C. If you want really cheap vitamin C made in China, you can go online or go to an agricultural store and purchase a sodium ascorbate or ascorbic acid for horses. Ascorbic acid is the more common form of vitamin C. It’s acidic and has a tart flavor to it. It’s used in animal feed as well in certain cases, but not always because a lot of animals make their own vitamin C. An agricultural supply of ascorbic acid is usually fairly inexpensive if you just want to stockpile it. If you want high-end stuff, we sell non-GMO vitamin C that doesn’t come from China. It actually comes out of the U.K., but it’s premium price. It’s not something that’s going to make your budget happy because it’s a lot more expensive when it’s not from China. The better thing to do is to grow some food. You want to grow some vitamin C? You just grow some kumquat bushes and trees or figs or lemons or oranges, if you’re in the right climate for that. Even bananas have vitamin C. You can dry those. You can have your own banana orchard, dry them or can them if you want, or prepare them in different ways. But you’ve got to have a source of vitamin C or you’ll die without it. NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 39"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Vitamin C is made out of only three elements: hydrogen, carbon and oxygen. Just HCO, that’s it. It just takes a different number of those elements in a certain arrangement to create the vitamin C molecule, i.e., ascorbic acid. That molecule is synthesized by orange trees and kumquat trees. These plants make it, so it’s not like a mineral. A mineral has to be found in the soil and brought in through the roots – minerals like zinc, selenium, magnesium or manganese. Those have to be brought in; those are immutable. You can’t make minerals. Plants just sort of mine them out of the soil, but plants do make vitamin C. They make it, and it’s just hydrogen, carbon and oxygen. The hydrogen comes from the H2O in the water that they absorb through the soil. The carbon comes from carbon dioxide that they absorb out of the air because CO2 is the food source for plants, combined with photosynthesis that creates plant energy. The oxygen comes from water out of the ground. There’s also a little bit of oxygen in the air, but plants don’t use that so much. They exhale oxygen instead of absorbing it. The HCO, plants just gather those elements from water and air, and then they create vitamin C. I think that’s such a cool concept to keep in mind when you’re talking about a survival scenario, you might think to yourself, “Gosh, I wish I owned a factory that made vitamin C.” The fact is, if you just plant a kumquat tree now, you will own one. Because a little kumquat tree produces vitamin C fruits even in the first year. You can eat your way back to good health just by eating plants that produce it for free. You don’t have to go to a grocery store. You don’t have to pay a royalty. You don’t have to go to a pharmacy. You don’t need a doctor’s prescription for this stuff. You just need to grow some food. Vitamin C can be found even in certain vegetables, but it’s mostly in fruits. This is actually a good segue into sprouting because sprouts also contain vitamin C. Sprouts are like Mother Natures’ magic. They synthesize an amazing array of antioxidants and carotenoids, as well as all kinds of nutrients, medicinal substances and natural antibiotics. It’s amazing! Let’s say you have a bag of dried broccoli seeds. Nothing has sprouted yet; it’s just a bag sitting by itself. Inside that bag of broccoli seeds, there is no vitamin C. There’s no sulforaphane, no glucosinolates. These are all phytochemicals that have anti- cancer and anti-diabetes effects. They’re anti-inflammatories. In that bag of seeds, none of those molecules exist. Take those seeds and spread them out on a tray with a paper towel underneath them. Put some water in the tray and sprout those seeds. After five days, those seeds have become sprouts. If you were to run them through food analysis using a mass spectrometry instrument, you would find high levels of glucosinolates or sulforaphane or vitamin C or various carotenoids. You’ll find all kinds of things that did not exist five days earlier. How did those come to exist? That’s my point. The seeds made that stuff. It synthesized these nutrients. The seeds pulled air and pulled molecules out of the air and H2O out of the water and did this amazing chemistry project inside the seed to create these things. They also built their own leaves, too. If you let seeds keep growing, they’ll build a root system and stems. They’ll also build broccoli florets if you let them grow enough. You can do hydroponic gardening and see this for yourself. Plants don’t even need soil. You can grow watermelons with nothing but basically water and nutrients. I’ve grown tomato plants hydroponically. They had massive root systems even without soil. Where do the tomatoes come from? The plants made that. The plants synthesized the tomatoes. They synthesized the lycopene that’s in tomatoes. The plants are synthesizing these things. HealthRangerStore.com/SurvivalAmla NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 40"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"You don’t need to own a supplement factory if you just have a home garden. You can grow all this stuff. Green peppers have vitamin C in them. All you’ve got to do is know how to grow food and how to handle seeds. This is the point of gardening and the key strategy for Survival Nutrition. You’re not growing food just for the calories. In fact, most of the food that you are growing should be for providing the medicinal nutrients, such as vitamin C, carotenoids, antioxidants, anthocyanidins and all these other things that exist in food. These are the things that can keep you alive. These are the things that are anti-cancer, anti- diabetes and anti-Alzheimer’s. These are the things that promote alertness, wound healing, cognitive function, cardiovascular fitness and recovery from exertion. These are the things that help your body handle stress. You’re growing your medicine cabinet in dirt. The plants are making the molecules that your body needs. That’s the point of growing fruits, vegetables, turmeric, garlic and onions, because you want the quercetin out of the onions. The quercetin is antiviral. The turmeric is anti- inflammatory, garlic is antiviral and antibiotic. You’re growing medicine essentially for free. You’re not paying for these medicinal molecules. Mother Nature is building them for you for free. This is the shortcut; it’s almost like cheating, but in a positive way. You get all this medicine for free; Mother nature makes it for you, synthesizes it out of water and air, and then you get to harvest it and eat it and have all the benefits of that medicine. This is why you can’t live forever on stored food. This is why I teach people stored food should really only get you going into growing your own food. The purpose of stored food is to have that buffer, to give you a 180-day buffer so you can plant food, grow food, harvest food and get off the stored food. Because eventually, you’ve got to be able to sustain your farming operation. You have to be able to sustain your production and consumption. That means at some point, you have to grow your own food. Growing your own food is not just about calories, it’s not just about potatoes and having enough calories per day. It’s about the medicine. It’s the medicine that’s going to keep you alive. If you had an unlimited supply of venison meat – let’s say your neighbor is an expert deer hunter and brings you venison meat day after day after day for free. If you lived on venison meat alone, you would die, even if it were free. You would die because you’re not getting any vitamin C. You’re not getting any nutrients other than the meat proteins and the fat. While fat is necessary, you’ve got to have other things, too. You need the cilantro, you need to grow basil, oregano and all these simple culinary herbs like sage and thyme. You need to grow those. You need to eat those. Why? Because they contain medicine. This is what’s going to keep you alive in a survival scenario. There’s even a term for it – guerilla gardening, which means gardening in a surreptitious way, where the authorities can’t come destroy your garden or seize your garden. You might want to have your garden in a place that’s not so easy for other people to find, or they might steal all your garden stuff. Kumquat thieves could be out there, picking your kumquats, stealing your figs and your melons. They’re going to try to steal your food because it takes effort and time to grow food. While you’re waiting months, you have to keep working and you have to pull weeds. You have to provide water. You have to deal with white aphids, weird flies, bugs, caterpillars and everything that’s trying to eat your food before you can. Then there are the birds and the rabbits, and they’re trying to eat your food, too. Depending on where you live, there might be deer munching on your apple trees, or wild hogs coming to eat your garden and root it up. You might wake up one morning and say, “My goodness, all the carrots and onions are gone. Somebody plowed the field and took everything.” Yes, it was a group of wild hogs and they’re all over Texas and Oklahoma and a lot of the south of the United States. They’re everywhere. I used to see them all the time, just out walking. I haven’t seen them so much recently because I think the neighbors keep shooting them all. If they can find your food, they will come get it. If you’re in Arizona, they have the javelina out there that’ll come eat your food or take your garden. NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 41"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"This is why big picture analysis is so important. The thing about this is, when it hits the fan, the average American who is oblivious to where food comes from – do you know what they’re going to do when they realize that the grocery stores aren’t going to be restocked? They’re going to go to the local 7-Eleven, and they’re going to break in and they’re going to steal bags of Doritos. They’re going to think this is food. No, it isn’t. There’s nothing in that bag that’s going to keep you alive. They’re going to steal Pop- Tarts and cornflakes or whatever is in the cereal boxes these days. These people won’t live very long because they don’t know anything about nutrition, just the concepts that I’ve covered here. They don’t understand that real food comes from Mother Nature, and it contains powerful medicines. Pomegranates, can you grow pomegranates where you live? You should! Pomegranate fruit is anti-cancer and it’s delicious. And the yellow rind part inside – not the seeds, but the rind part, the really bitter part – that’s the anti-cancer medicine. I am going to have more of a discussion about this. Wild foods in your area, what can you pick and eat? What grows in your nearby forest or even a community park, or maybe just in your own front yard? What grows there that is medicinal? Most people have – at least those who have yards – seen dandelions growing in their yards. Dandelion root is a liver tonic, and dandelions themselves are edible. You can eat the dandelion leaves. You can eat the dandelion flowers. When I was growing up, my mom used to go out and pick dandelions and just kind of coat them in some batter and we’d fry them up. We’d have fried dandelions. Now you’re starting to see kind of where I got some of this knowledge. It’s mostly from my parents and some years of experience. But I’ve always seen weeds in the yard as possible food. This varies region by region so much, you’re going to have to find out what is food in your area. There’s a whole philosophy on this that was popular at the Renaissance Festivals. It’s called siege cooking. People at the Renaissance Festivals who apparently have a lot of free time, they’ll have contests where they imagine that they’re in a castle that’s under siege and they have to cook up meals using just whatever ingredients are in the forest next door or something like that. You’d be amazed at some of these people – mostly women in this case – because they can put together amazing meals just by stomping around the forest for an hour, gathering up a bunch of stuff. They can make cuisine out of it. The food fit for Kings under siege, it’s pretty amazing. Some people have a lot of knowledge about wild foods, and that’s very important knowledge to have. It’s also important to know what not to try because you hear every year, people dying from making some homemade spaghetti with wild mushrooms. They go out, they find some mushrooms, and they’re like, “Yay, free mushrooms!” and they take them home. They slice them up and put them in a spaghetti sauce and they eat it. An hour later, they’re all dead and their livers are destroyed because it turns out that fungi produce some pretty crazy chemicals. You know how I was talking about plants producing vitamin C? Well, mushrooms, i.e., fungi, they produce crazy toxins, toxins that will eat your liver in an hour and kill you. Mushrooms can be very, very toxic, but also very delicious, i.e., morels and so on. Wild harvested morel mushrooms, they’re a delicacy in the Midwest. I remember family members going out and harvesting morel mushrooms and making some crazy dishes out of that and wild pokeweed. My grandmother would come in and say, “Hey, we’ve got poke salad.” I’m like, “What’s Poke?” She’s like, “Don’t worry about it. It’s good. Just eat it.” To this day, I don’t know what poke is. She gathered it up in the forest somewhere, some kind of green leafy vegetable. Since I own goats and I live on a ranch in Texas, I do take notice of what the goats eat, and goats can eat a wider variety of things than what you and I can eat. Goats can eat a crazy amount of stuff. Goats will just stomp into a briar patch of green, waxy leaves and thorns and everything. They’ll just clean it out. What is in there that is good to eat? Nothing. They’re just goats. They go crazy. NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 42"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"They’ll eat leaves off of an oak tree. My goats like to stand up on their hind legs and nibble on all the leaves that they can reach. They’re not into the grass that much. In fact, they barely ever eat grass. But they sure love tree leaves. They’ll just strip them off. I’ve got a couple of fig trees. I had to put a fencing around the fig trees cause the goats would just come in and eat the fig leaves off of the fig trees. Then they’ll just eat the fig bark. They’ll just strip the bark away and kill everything. Goats are not very environmentally sensitive creatures, believe it or not. They’re just kind of like walking, furry garbage disposals, like little fermenting machines on stilts. They don’t have knees. They walk around like they’re all on stilts all the time, just jumping around and eating everything, destroying every plant in sight. They will tear up a fig tree for whatever reason. Still, you could learn from goats about some things that might not be super toxic. Watch the animals where you live. Some birds eat things that are toxic to humans because they’re immune to the poisons, so you’ve got to be careful. But gain knowledge about what’s in your area, about weeds, wild herbs and acorns even. Did you know you can eat acorns? You just have to process the tannins out of them. You can gather up a bunch of acorns, put all the acorn nutmeat into a giant container and just drip water through that for days. I’ve never done that. Then you can just rinse all the tannins out and you can make acorn nutmeat out of it. That’s perfectly edible. Again, I’ve never done that, so you might want to look that up before you try it. But acorns are a source of food. There’s a lot of wild foods out there. Know your area. Know what you can eat. Make an effort, especially in the springtime. What is sprouting out there that is edible? Like wild fennel, wild salad greens. Some people even do a stir fry of like fern sprouts. They harvest those and chow down on them. There’s a lot that you can do if you know about the foods in your area. I do want to get back to sprouting here and just kind of wrap up the thoughts on sprouting. The easiest way to start growing food and medicine is to sprout seeds. You can get broccoli or alfalfa seeds; you can sprout lentils and chickpeas if you want. You can sprout all kinds of things. You can do flax sprouts, quinoa sprouts and oat sprouts. Anything that sprouts, you can turn it into medicine in just a few days. I strongly recommend that this be your initial effort. When the food system goes down, start sprouting immediately. Then in a few days, you’ll have some very powerful medicine and nutrition. During those few days, also start growing other sources of food that will produce food within 75 to 120 days, the typical garden food or herbs. When the food system goes down, just go into action, and this means having sprouting seeds on-hand and having some sprouting experience, which is very, very simple. You can sprout in a jar if you want. The hardest part about sprouting is that, sometimes, it’ll grow mold. A good sprouting really requires cooler temperatures. You want your temperatures much lower than normal room temperature, typically like something in the sixties. I’ve seen some people use hydrogen peroxide to stop the growth of mold and bacteria. That can be effective, but you can’t overdo it or you’ll damage your plants big time. You’ll damage the sprouts with too much oxygen. You’ve got to be careful with that. HealthRangerStore.com/SurvivalBroccoli NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 43"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"The good news about sprouting is that you can mix in minerals. You can mix in zinc or you can have some ocean minerals or like an ocean mineral concentrate, just a little bit of ocean water essentially. Sprouts do really well in a small amount of ocean water because ocean water contains all the minerals that you need, plus plenty of magnesium. Sprouts do really well in a little bit of ocean water. The most important thing is that sprouts grow medicine for you very quickly, almost effortlessly. You can get some sprouting devices out there that are non- electric. I wouldn’t make anything too fancy, just stick to the basics. You can get a sprouting lid that goes on a regular, wide-mouth canning jar, and you can sprout in the jar just using this lid. You can get a sprouting bag and you can just sprout out of a wet sack that you keep moist. But you’ll need to keep the sprouting seeds fresh because they won’t last more than a couple of years. You’ll have to restock those seeds every couple of years, but it’s going to be well worth it. Sprouting is a miracle of natural medicine. It will save your life, especially in a collapse scenario. Let’s talk about the equipment that you’ll need in a Survival Nutrition scenario. Most of the food that we consume day to day when it’s not a survival situation is processed food. It’s been pre-chopped or pre-milled, or even pre-cooked. When the whole food preparation process is up to you, you’re going to need a lot of utensils and pots and pans that you may not have. You’re going to need a wheat grinder. I recommend that you buy a wheat grinder, which is a hand mill. There are electric mills. If you’re not strong enough to grind wheat by hand, you might want to use an electric mill. But it’s better to have an off-grid alternative, so you could grind it by hand. There are a number of high-end grain mills out there that are kind of expensive. Some of them are cast iron with big, stone grinding wheels. You should get one of those because you never know if you’ll be able to even use electricity for a while. Some of the zero-day attacks that are being planned out there for after the election talked about taking down the power grid. You don’t want to end up in a situation where you have no electricity. I also recommend that you get a manual juice squeezer. You can get kind of like a wheatgrass juicer that is a hand-cranked version. They’re brutal to use. I’m not going to try to sugarcoat this for you. They’re difficult to use. It takes a lot of arm strength; you get very little juice but, in a pinch, if you need nutrients from plants, you can just take grass and you can juice it. Most grasses, you can juice, and you can drink that. It tastes incredibly horrible and nasty, but people are paying $8 a shot for wheatgrass shots at Whole Foods. You can actually just take a pair of scissors and you can cut grass out of your yard in an emergency, and you can juice that and drink the juice. Make sure you don’t have some weird exotic plants in your yard that might be toxic for some reason. You can juice dandelions; you can juice normal grasses, such as wheatgrass. Other grasses can be juiced as well. Basically, wheatgrass juice is just sprout juice. You could sprout all kinds of things, such as broccoli or radish sprouts, lentils or even a millet or teff. You can juice those sprouts and drink their juice, and it’s going to have a lot of nutrients. If you’re sprouting, it’s probably better to just eat the whole sprout because you need the fiber as well. Have a juicing appliance that is non-electric if possible. Also, have some double boilers. Have a wide selection of high-quality pots and pans, including pots that you would use on a camp stove or on a wood-burning stove, or something that you could even put on a grill. Maybe you have a wood fire grill or a fire pit that you build out of cinderblocks and some kind of metal grating. You could just put pots and pans over that fire, and you could cook that way, or do it like the old cowboys used to do and just have a steel rod across a fire pit and hang a pot on that steel rod. In that pot, you might cook beans and lentils and put meat in it. You might have sausage or some fresh meat from an animal that you hunted and processed into wild game meat. You could put quinoa in that, you can put onions and vegetables and garlic to make it taste better. You can cook a pot of food over a fire, but you have to have the pot. You’ve got to have the right utensils. You need to have a way to handle those hot pots. You can have like metal clamps that you can use to lift them and carry them around or you can have heat resistant, silicone gloves or heat mitts, or all kinds of things like that. NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 44"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"You’re going to need large stir spoons. You’re going to need spatulas. You’re going to need cast-iron skillet pans, which are a great for cooking over a fire. Use a cast iron skillet; but you’re going to need a scrub brush in order to clean all of these things. Strangely, a lot of American households today don’t have this equipment because they’re relying again on so much processed food. Oh, they open a bag of Doritos or they open a box of Pop-Tarts, or they just pop something into the microwave. I haven’t used a microwave in 20 years now. Don’t even own one. Don’t need them. Well, I do have one in the laboratory that we’ve used for some experiments, but I don’t have a microwave at home, and I don’t want one. Speaking of equipment, make sure that you have an outdoor stove. I mentioned this before: Have something where you can cook a volume of food, especially if you have a family or a community. You’re going to need to be able to cook quite a large volume of food. Have some large pots or some large skillets and a place where you can put them over a fire and where you can burn wood. If you have a charcoal grill only then make sure you stock up on charcoal. Personally, I’m not a big fan of charcoal, but I happen to live on a ranch where I have a lot of trees, and some of them fall down every year. It’s very easy to just make small pieces of firewood out of that, so I’ve got a ready fire source or fire fuel source to use for these things. If you don’t have that, you can stockpile maybe some mesquite wood or charcoal so that you can get your fires going there for food. Don’t forget manual can openers, emergency can openers that don’t require electricity, and ones that are portable, too, that you could use. There’s some that are very small, you can put them in your pocket. Others have a handle and a rotating cutting edge that you have to crank by hand. Just make sure that you own enough of these so that you’ve always got a can opener when you need it. Many of the items you may have stockpiled will, of course, be in cans. In addition, make sure you have a food dehydrator; the Excalibur brand is fine. There are other dehydrators that are less expensive. You can also use the sun to dry foods, and you can have a solar oven, which basically just uses a parabolic mirror to reflect light. Solar ovens – I’ve messed with a few of them. They’re not good because they cook very slowly, obviously. If it’s a cloudy day, you’re not going to get your meal. That should be considered the last-ditch way to cook food. It’s much more reliable to have a fire and to control that fire and use it to boil water, cook your food or boil a pot of soup or whatever you have in mind. Have a dehydrator as well and have a rack that you could use if you need to sun dry certain types of foods. That’s a very important process in this, and it works better if you’re in a very dry climate like Southern Arizona or Southern California or Nevada. If you’re in a very humid climate, that’s not so good. You’re just going to end up growing mold on your food, which can be quite a health hazard. I want to circle back around and talk about rodent-proofing your stored food containers. Many people will make this mistake and lose a lot of food. You know those thin plastic lids that go on coffee cans or what we call #10 cans? Those lids can be eaten through by mice. I’ve seen it. They’ll just chew right through them and leave behind little plastic bits and a hole. Then everything inside the can will be gone. NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 45"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"You’ve got to get the pails, the buckets, the three-and-a-half gallon pails or five-gallon pails, as they’re called. They’re made out of polyethylene, and they’re very sturdy. I don’t know how many millimeters thick they are, but it seems like it’s a sufficient number. I’ve never seen rodents eat through that. You could choose metal containers to store your foods, but metal can oxidize and rust. You could choose Tupperware type of containers like plastic containers, but I’ve found that those aren’t very reliable. They can distort under changing conditions of pressure and heat, and they lose their seal very often. They can be easily defeated by certain types of animals, such as raccoons, and raccoons will go in and open all your stuff. Raccoons can work combination locks. They’ve got clever little fingers, and they know how to open and close latches. They’re very good at that. If you have food in a Tupperware container and if he can access that, he’ll come along and just open that up, and he’ll eat all your food and just leave it and just trash everything. Raccoons just trash everywhere they’ve been. Raccoons are kind of like mobs, mobs of arsonists, and domestic terrorists. They just trash everything. They leave behind a destroyed city, just like a burned down area; nothing but destruction in their wake. That’s what raccoons do. They’re very good at that. A few other topics here and then we’ll finish up the food chapter of Survival Nutrition. I do want to mention that many, many foods are natural sources of antibiotics. In other words, they serve as systemic antibiotics and help your body beat infections. They may not necessarily treat acute infections, such as wound injuries that have become infected – and I’m not saying that you should avoid medical care. I’m just saying that you can enhance your body’s immune response by eating a lot of foods that contain natural antibiotics, and those include things like garlic. If you can drink a little bit of raw garlic juice, if you could handle it, don’t overdo it. It’ll make you vomit if you do. If you can drink a little bit of that with your other juice, it’s powerful. It’s good for your heart. It’s anti-inflammatory. It can boost brain function. It’s anti-cancer and it’s anti-inflammatory, and it’s a natural antibiotic at the same time. The same thing is true with onions, ginger and turmeric. All of these foods contain natural antibiotics. In fact, if you go into the more bitter-tasting fruits, such as pomegranate seeds, and pomegranate juice, which has been squeezed out of the pomegranate rind, that is not only anti-cancer, but also anti-inflammatory and, in a sense, antibiotic as well. There are many herbs, culinary herbs, that you can grow by yourself. Basil is super easy to grow and extremely antiviral and antibacterial. You should just grow it and eat it fresh. You don’t even really have to process it; your body does that for you. Just eat basil. You just grab some basil leaves and eat them every day. Do that with thyme, sage, cilantro and all kinds of small little shrub-like herbs that you can easily grow. All of these are antibacterial. If you’re in a collapse scenario and you’re concerned about the collapse of hospitals, the lack of pharmacies, and maybe a biological weapon circulating around infecting people, you should grow all these herbs and you should consume them daily as a natural defense. Don’t wait around thinking, “Oh I’m going to wait for the science. I’m going to wait for the study to prove it.” No, that’s going to take years. It probably will never happen. Just eat all the antiviral herbs, like oregano, for example. You can grow oregano; you can eat that. It’s powerful; it’s incredibly potent. Just use what you can grow. You can also harvest herbs, the wild foods that we talked about. They have antibacterial properties. This is incredibly important. HealthRangerStore.com/SurvivalBucket NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 46"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"In a collapsed scenario, your blood sugar will probably be more under control than usual because you won’t be eating all the toxic processed foods made with refined white sugar and refined white flour and all these toxic substances. You’ll be eating more stone- ground, whole wheat bread that you made yourself. You’ll be eating these salad greens that you grew yourself or wild foods that you collected from the forest behind your apartment complex or something. And all of these foods are going to be healthier for you than the crap that you’ve been buying at the grocery store, because these are real foods and they’re unprocessed. Your blood sugar should be way more under control in a collapse scenario, and this is good news for people who are Type 2 diabetics, people who rely on insulin. I’ve found over the years that most people who rely on insulin continue to feed themselves the toxic foods that cause diabetes in the first place, and they just control it with insulin. They’ll drink the soda, eat ice cream, eat the donuts, and then they’ll just inject themselves with insulin. They think in a collapse, they’re going to need lots of insulin because that’s what they’re used to. Many of those people may find they don’t need insulin or don’t need as much insulin as before. Some people can eliminate it altogether just by turning to a healthy diet. I’ve seen it firsthand; I’ve interviewed people who have overcome Type 2 diabetes in as little as four days just by changing their diet. This will happen naturally in a collapse, when you don’t have access to the grocery store. If you are a Type 2 diabetic and if it hasn’t progressed to a very advanced stage, you should have some optimism about this and change your diet, and you may not need insulin at all. Advanced stage is when you have no blood circulating in your feet and you can’t feel your feet anymore. If you’re about to have them amputated, that’s a very advanced stage. It’s good to have some insulin, in case you need it, but insulin doesn’t store very well in a grid-down scenario. It’s got a very limited shelf life, and it can’t get warm. If you don’t keep it cold, it’s gone, it’s destroyed. You may be able to simply maintain your blood sugar balance just by eating herbs and whole grains and not consuming processed sugars, processed wheat, soda and garbage like that. In this way, a collapse will actually save a lot of lives from the toxic food industry. If you’re suffering from cancer or cardiovascular problems and heart disease, much of the same thing will happen when you turn to natural foods. Sometimes, even if it’s not by choice but just by necessity, your health will improve. You will be consuming anti-cancer foods. Most of those herbs that I just mentioned, like garlic, ginger, cilantro, basil and so on, they’re all anti-cancer as well. Most of the cases of cancer that people suffer from are, in a sense, self-induced. In other words, they’re caused by foods that they’re eating or lifestyle habits that they’ve chosen to pursue, such as smoking or toxic recreational drug use. You can only do so much with gasoline-extracted heroin before you have problems with mutagenesis in your body. In a collapsed scenario, the food that you’ll be able to live on will have anti-cancer effects. This is not true with a lot of toxic stored food, the processed stored food that I mentioned earlier, which is full of toxic ingredients, such as partially hydrogenated oils, hidden forms of MSG, genetically modified corn derivatives, maltodextrin, corn syrup solids, GMO, canola oil and hydrogenated powders made from canola oil. That stuff is pro-cancer. That stuff will give you blood sugar problems, heart disease, Alzheimer’s dementia, cancer, kidney stones and liver disorders. If you’re living on processed stored food, you’re going to get worse during the collapse. But if you’re living on the fresh food that you’re forced to sprout or harvest yourself, or the bread you make from the whole wheat flour you get by grinding up whole wheat, all of that stuff is going to reverse your chronic diseases. In fact, for some people, a collapse scenario will be the best thing that ever happened to their personal health, because it’ll get them off of the toxic foods that they’ve been living on. It’ll even get them off the toxic pharmaceuticals they’ve been taking. NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 47"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"I understand that some pharmaceuticals might be necessary for certain conditions, such as thyroid conditions, but statin drugs and high blood pressure drugs – most of them are just medical hoaxes. You can eliminate diabetes drugs just by changing your diet. People undergoing chemotherapy are just poisoning themselves. Get off the chemo, you’ll actually get better. There are many, many drugs like that, such as osteoporosis drugs and dementia drugs. Most of these drugs are just toxic chemicals that have been fraudulently approved by the FDA, which has been captured by the drug companies. In a collapse, you’re going to be amazed how healthy you might get, and you’re going to be more physical because you’ll be working more. You might be calorie restricted, not by choice, but you’ll be fasting inadvertently. I’m not saying it’s going to be fun. Fasting, i.e. starving, is not a fun experience, especially if it’s been forced upon you. If you’re going to bed hungry at night because you can’t find enough to eat, that’s not a happy experience, but it may actually improve your health. The key in all of this is to drink lots of water because your body may be detoxing from all of the old foods that you’ve been consuming. Your body’s trying to eliminate those toxins for the first time. You’re eating new things. Sprouts are incredibly good at detoxing your body. You may let loose a bowel movement of some old, undigested food that has been in you for years. Suddenly, it’s going away because now you’ve got herbs, and you’ve got anti-parasite effects with many of your herbs. I’m not trying to get gross here, but a lot of people have parasites, tapeworms and hookworms living all throughout their bodies. When you start getting on these really strong herbs, natural foods, super foods and raw foods, a lot of these worms and parasites can’t live in that environment. They will let go or be killed and they’ll just flush out of your system. Don’t be surprised if you experience this. If there is a food supply collapse and you end up living on these things that I’m talking about and scrambling for fresh herbs in the backyard, don’t be surprised if a couple of weeks into this, you start seeing crazy stuff coming out of your body that you never imagined was even in you. Some of that is not you; it’s parasites and microbes. You’ll change your entire gut microbiome by doing this. You’ll change your whole life. Your moods will change. Your cognitive performance will go up. Your energy resilience and level of fitness will go up as you go into a survival diet based on fresh foods, raw foods and whole foods. Don’t look at this as necessarily a bad thing. And make sure that when you store food for survival purposes, it is clean, wholesome food. Don’t stock up on a bunch of processed food, because then you’re just perpetuating the same illnesses that you had before the collapse. At least use the food collapse to vastly improve your life. You can have a silver lining in all of this. Take advantage of the opportunity to have whatever benefits you can. In summarizing this food chapter, let me just kind of give you the big picture overview and wrap this up with the reminder: Stock up on sprouting seeds. I know they’re kind of hard to find right now, but if you stock up on sprouting seeds and keep them in a refrigerator or a cool pantry where it’s dry and there’s no moisture, you’ll have a ready food supply. You can start sprouting and have food within the day. I don’t know if you’ve ever tried to live on sprouts, but you’ll probably want some salad dressing or some mayonnaise or vinegar or something to go along with it. You can make some different sauce mixes. You can have salads made out of nothing but sunflower seed sprouts, which are very good. It would be a good idea to get familiar with this in advance, if you ever want to live on sprouts for a few days. You’ll get sick of those sprouts really fast if you don’t have something to go along with them. When it comes to healthy sources of sugar, palm sugar is the best. Palm sugar has a very low glycemic index. It tastes really sweet. It’s kind of brown like brown sugar, but it’s not artificially brown. It’s actually rich in minerals, and you can use it to sweeten all kinds of foods, sauces or drinks. It mixes with tea and is water-soluble. NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 48"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"That’s why in my food storage system, I store things that are really simple, like a big can of chia seeds, a can of palm sugar and a can of flax seed. If I want to, I can just take a jar of water and I can put chia seeds in it, put that in the refrigerator for 12 hours or so. The chia seeds will expand; they’ll soak up the water and make little chia gel balls inside the water that look kind of like tapioca. Then you can just stir in some palm sugar and you’re done, you have a drink. You have like a chia seed sweet dessert drink of some kind. Chia seeds are full of omega-3s. They’re full of a certain amount of protein and some fiber and vitamins, and so on. Just having cans of chia seeds is very important. You could mix chia seeds with quinoa in a soup or mix chia seeds with oatmeal for a breakfast – almost like your own homemade muesli. The key is to stockpile the raw ingredients that you can use to mix and match in the future and stay away from storing processed food. That’s the big picture in this: Stay away from processed food because it isn’t going to help you in all of this. Think about what you’ll need, like calories, which come from carbohydrates from plants. You don’t want refined sugars, but you do need calories because you’re going to be physically active. You’re going to need minerals, which are found more prominently in organic foods and superfoods, because minerals are the catalyst for the enzymatic reactions in your body that keep you healthy and keep your heart healthy. You’re also going to need plant nutrients, which are the natural medicines. It’s the plant nutrients that are the antibacterial molecules. They are the nutrients from those herbs I mentioned, from basil, oregano, and so on. Those are the anti-cancer nutrients, the sulforaphane in broccoli sprouts, the glucosinolates in cruciferous vegetables and the sulfur that’s found in garlic. These molecules are the medicines. You need to cover all three of these things; and where a lot of people go wrong is, they’re storing food which has just processed calories. They’re missing out on the minerals and the phytochemicals, which are the medicinal molecules. In fact, most of the stored foods sold out there are sold based just on calories. They lack the minerals and the medicinal molecules because they have almost no fresh food and fresh plants, nothing that’s even based on herbs of any kind. They just have calories, and calories alone will kill you. If you don’t believe me, just look around at Houston, Texas, the fattest city in America, where half the population is obese. They have plenty of calories, but they don’t have health. Why? Because they’re lacking minerals and the phytochemicals, or phytonutrients, the healing molecules from plants. You can’t live on calories alone. A lot of natural food sources, such as figs, will combine these things. Figs will have the sugars, the calories, plus the minerals, fiber and natural medicinal molecules. For instance, a pigment that makes its outer skin purple-looking and provides coloration to the fig fruit itself. In the fig seeds, there are some oils that are healthy and there’s some protein in it. A healthy food from Nature will combine all these, but processed stored food have their minerals stripped away during processing, which kills or denatures the medicinal molecules and destroys them. You end up with bland- looking food with no color to it. It’s either white food or off-white food. They have to add artificial colors back to make it look like real food, and that’s most stored food in the industry. That food will get you killed. Learn that lesson from this chapter of Survival Nutrition. It’s important to expand your understanding of what is food, and then you’ll realize that most stored food or storable food isn’t food, it’s a shadow of food, just empty calories that will ultimately get you killed. Oh, plus a lot of toxic chemicals and hydrogenated oils, things like that. You’ve got a lot of work to do probably after listening to this chapter, but it’s not that difficult. Get your sprouting jars ready to go. Do a little sprouting yourself, just to try it out and see what sprouts taste like. There are different kinds of sprouts, and some of them get pretty wicked. If you get into broccoli sprouts or radish sprouts, you can only use a little bit of that. You can’t just chow down on broccoli sprouts all day. HealthRangerStore.com/SurvivalTurmericPepper NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 49"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Experiment with this. It’s very easy. It’s very cheap. It’s very inexpensive to do sprouting, and water is essentially free. You don’t even need sunlight to do sprouting, that’s the other advantage. You can do guerilla sprouting in a hidden basement, closet or something, where no one even knows that you’re growing food. But you have a giant sprout system going and you’re feeding yourself and family members with just seeds and water, even in the dark. That’s what’s amazing about sprouts. That’s why I’m such a big fan of sprouts as emergency food. Remember the sprouts create their own vitamins and nutrients. As they’re sprouting, they’re actually synthesizing molecules that you need to maintain your health. That’s why they’re just miraculous for survival applications. Lastly, make sure you’re in an area where you can grow food, where you’ve got sufficient soil, enough of water for irrigation – maybe rainfall – and enough sunlight. Make sure you’re in a climate where you can grow food. If you’re in a colder climate, you might need a greenhouse, so get that ready or just a simple hoop house. It’s very inexpensive. Just build one using some plastic sheeting, some metal hoops and a simple frame. You can set those up and even put a little wood-burning stove inside of one of those. It’s an interesting setup. Try not to melt the plastic with your hot stove pipe coming out of there. There are a number of things you can do to grow food in almost any climate; it just takes a little preparation. The last place you want to be, obviously, is stuck in a city, because cities are very difficult places to grow food. You don’t have the space, the soil or the agricultural community, and you can’t park a tractor in your driveway in a city. You don’t have wild foods in a city. Make this food plan part of your relocation plan. Get to an area that can sustain you because your long-term survival is going to require growing your own food. I know there are some people who believe they can just store enough food to get through everything, and they’ll store years of food and wait until they find out it’s not really food. Those of us who really want to survive, it’s going to come down to producing some percentage of our own food. That might be 30%, might be 50%, might be more, but you’re going to have to grow some amount of food to some extent, if you hope to make it through the food scarcity that’s coming. Couple of final notes here. I have interviewed the ice age farmer as he’s known, Christian Westbrook is his name. He talks about food scarcity and how it’s being engineered as a globalist weapon to enslave humanity and to oppress everybody. That interview is free to hear, it’s on Brighteon.com .

You might think at first, maybe it’s a little strange to have a section on water in a book on Survival Nutrition. But, of course, water goes right along with it because if you don’t have clean water and you don’t have a source of water, you’ll die from dehydration. You need water to make food, and you need water to digest food. They actually do go hand in hand. We’re going to talk about a couple of things here. Number one, water sources, including rainwater collection, well water and groundwater that you can harvest. We’ll talk about water filtration. We’ll also talk about water collection, some different ways that you can gather it, and even a few ideas about how to carry or distribute it. I run a forensic food laboratory as you know, CWCLabs.com . We do a lot of water testing there. In fact, water’s the easiest thing to test on scientific instruments. We test for heavy metals. We test for glyphosate. We test for other chemicals, including PFAS, from time to time, as well as various pesticides and herbicides. Here’s what I can tell you as a very experienced scientist who has tested lots and lots of water. In fact, we’ve taken the ERA water proficiency testing for many, many years. In addition to our ISO accreditation, we also qualify using these ERA tests. They send us a water sample with unknown, specific quantities of different toxic elements and we have to measure that and send them back the test results. Then they tell us if we pass or fail. Of course, we always pass. We actually have a lot of experience testing water. The cleanest water that you will ever get, by far, is rainwater, including rainwater that comes off a roof. Even if it comes off a roof that’s not necessarily perfectly clean, that rainwater is going to be much cleaner than any water that you get from the ground, especially from under the ground. Underground water, i.e., well water, is the dirtiest water. This is not necessarily intuitive to a lot of people. Some people think that, well, rainwater must be dirtier because the air is polluted and groundwater must be clean because the dirt and the ground and the sand and the clay are filtering out everything. By the time it gets 600 feet underneath in the aquifer, it must be clean. That’s what a lot of people think. But no, it’s actually the opposite. Rainwater is very, very clean because it turns out that when rain, which is distilled ocean water, falls through the air, it doesn’t actually pick up much stuff at all, hardly anything. It’s not like the sky is so dirty that it’s raining mud or something. Rainwater is very clean, but well water is heavily polluted. The reason is because a lot of the toxic runoff from agriculture, including pesticides and herbicides, ends up in the aquifers. The same thing happens with city and industrial waste, biosludge and biosolids, which include heavy metals, pharmaceutical runoff, birth control pills, over-the-counter drugs and recreational drugs. The aquifers are very, very polluted. On top of that, the aquifers have toxic elements. There are a lot of toxic elements in certain types of wells. For example, there’s cancer-causing arsenic in a lot of wells all over the world. Some wells have high levels of copper that become toxic. Some wells have fluoride in them that causes brittle bones, cancer and mottled dark teeth, all kinds of things. You’ll notice if you have a well that you might have to have some water cleaning equipment attached to that wellhead, something that removes iron, sulfur or calcium, because those are the types of minerals that come out of well water. NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 51"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Well water is heavily, heavily mineralized. Some of the minerals might be good, such as magnesium, but it turns out magnesium is not really that common in well water. Magnesium’s very common in ocean water, but not in well water. In well water, you get a lot of other things, usually things that you don’t want, such as excessive iron, for example, and sometimes traces of lead and arsenic are very, very common in well water. In fact, arsenic in well water, I think, is one of the top causes of cancer in third world nations, or developing nations, because they’re just drinking the arsenic day after day and it’s toxic. Even deep well water is not very clean. There is no well water that I’m aware of on the planet that is clean. The problem with well water is it’s not just dirty from, let’s say, bacteria or pathogens, where you could just boil it and get rid of all that stuff. No, it has toxic elements that you actually have to use a very high-density filtration media, such as a carbon block filter or a coconut shell carbon or KDF – which is a water filtration media that’s used in a lot of water filters -- to eliminate. There are many different technologies for removing toxins from water, but it’s not as simple as just boiling it. If you have to choose a water source, choose rainwater, and that is rainwater that you collect. If you go to surface water, such as pond water, stream water or river water, this is essentially rainwater, but it’s been washed through by whatever’s on the ground, and it may have a lot of runoff in it. If you’re in an agricultural area, you’re going to have runoff in the water of pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers, and sometimes even cow manure and hog farm runoff. Guess what you get in that water? Oh, E. coli. It comes from animal intestines, and it can make you very sick and kill you. This is why you want to sterilize that water. This leads me to the advantage of collecting water yourself. When you collect water from a rooftop – even a small roof – and you collect it in a 50-gallon drum, or maybe you have a 500-gallon rainwater tank or a 5,000-gallon tank, whatever you’ve got. If you can collect the water, then you control it. You know it’s not going to have agricultural runoff. You know it’s not going to have E. coli. You know that it doesn’t have toxic heavy metals in it. If you collect it, it’s very, very clean. It can grow algae, and it can have some bacteria in it, but I’ll talk about how to eliminate those. Nevertheless, even with those risks, rainwater that you collect is the best water in the world. It’s also slightly acidic, which I think makes it taste better – that’s just my opinion. Also, if you want to make that water taste even better, put a couple of drops of white vinegar in it. It makes the water taste almost sweet. A couple of drops per eight-ounce glass, pretty amazing what that does to water. Rainwater, of course, lacks minerals. It’s just water, which is fine. I don’t think of water as a source of minerals. These bottled water companies, they take city water, which is crap water. Bottled water companies like Dasani, Coca Cola, Pepsi and whatever, what they do is just take city water and then they filter it, usually through a reverse osmosis system. Then they add some minerals and bottle that. Then they say it has added minerals. But in truth, the added minerals are so close to zero that you would get more minerals by eating one pickle. There’s almost no mineral content in that bottled water, even when they add minerals in. It’s just a marketing gimmick. You would literally get more minerals by taking a multivitamin. That probably has a thousand times more minerals. Don’t think of water as a source of minerals. A lot of the minerals in water are inorganic minerals, which means they’re not really compatible with your biology. If you drink calcium-enriched water a lot, you can end up with calcification of your kidneys and calcification of your arteries. You don’t want excess calcium in your blood all the time. It’s actually not a good thing. For people who take calcium supplements – I’m talking about calcium carbonate, the cheap, crap calcium, which is always contaminated with lead –calcium carbonate will build up calcium in your body, and you’ll end up with kidney stones and calcification of various organs of your body, including your cardiovascular system and maybe your nervous system as well. More calcium is not always better. It can be a toxin; and in many people, it is. That’s why rainwater is so good. Being slightly acidic, rainwater also helps NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 52"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"decalcify your body. It sort of removes a little bit of calcium every time you drink it, but not so much calcium that it would strip your bones of the mineral. That’s what soda does. If you’re drinking soda, you’re drinking phosphoric acid, and that’s stripping the calcium right out of your bones. But rainwater doesn’t do that. There’s a huge difference in the pH between phosphoric acid and rainwater. Rainwater might be a 6.9 or something like that, just slightly on the acidic side, whereas phosphoric acid can be – even when diluted – 1.5 or something, which is very, very acidic and can be quite toxic. If you’re thinking about ways to get water during an emergency, always go with rainwater collection. There are lots of different ways to do this. The best systems that I’ve seen are systems that have PVC pipe coming down off the corner gutter, usually of your home or your barn or your roof. Then this goes into something like a large PVC tube that fills up. As that gets full, the water starts going into your collection tank. What that does is it takes the first wash of the dirtier, more dust-filled water off your roof. It goes into a kind of holding tank that usually has a small hole in the other end, like a one- millimeter hole, so that water very slowly just goes out of that. You can purchase different units like that. It doesn’t require any kind of special valves. There’s nothing really mechanical about it. There’s no electricity required, nothing like that. It just operates off physics. That’s the best system that I’ve seen effectively. It fills up this holding tank until the water goes higher and creates kind of a water bridge where the clean water goes into your collection tank. If you want to keep it simple, just collect water in your collection tank and understand you’ll have, over time, some sludge in the bottom, which is just dust basically, just dust and dirt. There’s nothing wrong with that. It takes a long time to build up. For just emergency situations, you don’t have to make this overly complicated. You can just collect rain into barrels. The bigger the barrel, the better, obviously, because you don’t know when it’s going to rain. Make sure the barrels are thick enough that sunshine doesn’t go through them because you don’t want light to reach the water inside or your barrel will start growing algae. You’ll basically be doing something like spirulina farming, which you don’t want in your drinking water. You don’t want a giant algae pond in your barrel of water. Thick barrels that block the sun keep it dark. Sometimes people will run the water into their garage and they’ll have a barrel in the garage, for example; but you have to deal with overflow as well. What happens when that barrel is full? Usually, you have an overflow valve on the top of your tank so that when it’s full, the water starts going out the top and then that drains out into your yard. You’ve got to think about these things, but you can probably find somebody locally who’s maybe a rainwater collection expert. If you cannot, check videos on YouTube. Maybe there are some on Brighteon.com as well. You have to do some research on this to find a good solution for yourself. But trust me, rainwater collection is the way to go here. HealthRangerStore.com/SurvivalLabs NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 53"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"You’ll obviously need some roof space in order to do this, and it’s always good to have a backup system. I’ve done rainwater collection before and I always had a backup well. The well was the plan B, so to speak. The well water was what I would use when it wasn’t raining and I ran out of rainwater. When it rains again, switch over to the rainwater. That’s the best system I recommend. Understand that even in the rainwater collection tank, bacteria and viruses can grow and they often do. You need to sterilize that water before you drink it and also be careful about your animals. If you have dogs, you’ll want to make sure that the water is sterilized before your dogs drink it as well. You don’t want to make your animals sick. There are a couple of ways to do that. If you have electricity, the best systems are the UV light systems combined with particulate filtration. The particulate filtration systems are just like a flow-through system using mounts on the wall. It’s got big filters, like cylindrical filters that you can swap out, and you have these big polycarbonate filter covers that fill with water. They force the water through that cylindrical-shaped filter. There are a lot of brands of this. They sell these at Home Depot and places like that. They’re just whole-house particulate filters. That should always be stage one. After that, run your water through a UV light filtration system. There are a number of these that are sold online as well. I would avoid the ones that are made in China. I would get a U.S. brand. I’m sorry, I can’t recommend any specific brand on this, but I’ve used several different brands and they’ve all worked. They are kind of expensive. They can run about $500 and they do require electricity, but they kill viruses and bacteria. They get the job done. Between those two filtration systems, the water is normally drinkable. Although at this point you haven’t taken out any metals that might be in it, but usually that’s okay because heavy metals don’t get into rainwater. And even if it falls on a metal roof, such as a barn roof, those are usually made of zinc. I’ve done the tests on this myself off of barn roof panels, r-panels. If you collect rainwater off those roof panels, how much zinc is in your water? I’ve done the test; it’s very small. I think it was less than 20 parts per billion. It was very small. No cause for concern. And zinc is nutritive in small amounts as well. Don’t worry about the rain being contaminated with heavy metals. Mostly, you just have to get rid of the particles and then kill the viruses and bacteria. Then that is going to be very usable rainwater that you can use for cooking, showering, bathing, drinking, animals and other things like that. In a pinch, you can use plastic water bottles or even plastic two-liter bottles to sterilize water using intense sunlight. Many people don’t know this, but you can take a piece of metal, usually something like r-panel or just sheet metal, and lay it essentially flat on the ground or on a platform, if you can angle it towards the sun, so you get more sun intensity on it. You can take small plastic water bottles, fill them with water and simply lay them on this sheet metal in the sun and allow the sun to cook them essentially for four to eight hours. This will kill viruses and bacteria, but it will not remove heavy metals because heavy metals are atomic elements and they don’t just vanish when they’re exposed to light. Unless you’re getting this water from the well, heavy metals shouldn’t be an issue. If it’s just rainwater or surface water, you should be mostly fine with this method – as long as it’s been filtered through some kind of a particulate filter in advance. HealthRangerStore.com/SurvivalIodine NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 54"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"This is a good reason to save some plastic bottles, and I don’t mean to turn you into a crazy hoarder or something where you’ll be on TV, in an episode of extreme hoarders. It is good to have some plastic bottles saved for this very reason, bottles that let light penetrate and are very lightweight. You can use them as emergency water sterilization devices. In addition, you could use a certain amount of iodine to sterilize water, and I’ve seen some emergency water sterilization camping products that are based on iodine. They work, but they make the water taste like iodine, which is kind of nasty. There are other ways to kill things in the water. You could use a certain amount of bleach – a small amount. You don’t want to drink bleach, and it tastes pretty gross so you have to be very careful with that. Add just a few drops per gallon, maybe only two drops per gallon for long-term storage, just to prevent any kind of growth of something nasty in it. Remember, you don’t want to drink too much bleach; we’re talking about emergency situations only. There are some devices out there that use electrolysis to turn salt, which is sodium chloride, into free chlorine ions. This causes the oxidation and destruction of pathogens in water, but it’s essentially like treating water with ozone. If you have an ozone generator, you can also stick that tube into the water and bubble ozone through the water. That will kill everything as well. There are a number of different ways to kill things in water. You can also boil it. Just work out whatever system is best for you, but start with the cleanest water you can start with. Let’s talk about surface water because surface water is often the easiest water for people to get. You might have a stream or a river or a pond, and you can just grab a bucket of water. This water can be very toxic, depending on where it came from. If it fell on your property and ran off of your land into your pond and you know that you haven’t sprayed a bunch of pesticides and toxic chemicals on your land, then it’s probably fairly safe. You only have to worry about things like amoeba, pond algae, bacteria, viruses and so on, and we know how to get rid of those. We’ve just covered that; you could use UV light, you could use ozone. You could use iodine – there are a lot of methods to do that. If you don’t know where the water came from, let’s say there’s a stream that runs behind your house and you think, “Oh, that stream has got water in it. I’ll just take some of that water.” Well, where did it come from? And if you have a river behind your house, most rivers in America are used as sewage dumping grounds by cities. Cities will treat raw human sewage, and they will take the water out of that sewage and dump it into the rivers. If you didn’t know that, then you might have to rethink your river float trip. Some people swim in these rivers and some people die from a flesh- eating amoeba or deadly, flesh- eating bacteria that get up in their nasal passages and eat their brain out. Look that up online, search for that. You’ll see people die every year in America from crazy, brain- eating bacteria that they get in rivers because they’re swimming in sewage. The smaller the stream or the more local it is to you, the better. With that, you can usually use something like a gravity water filter, like a Big Berkey or a Katadyn filter. You can use a camping filter and get that water to be fairly clean. You may want to pre-filter the water if it looks really dirty or if it’s murky. You don’t want to pour murky water into any of these expensive filtration systems. Here’s a tip on how to build your own water pre-filter system – two things to note. Number one, if you just have gravel and sand in a bucket – if you just have gravel on the bottom and then sand like 18 inches of sand (depends on how big your container) – you can make a good water filter with a bucket. I’ve done this with 20-gallon drums as well. You drill some holes in the bottom and cover those holes with gravel, and then you put a lot of sand in this bucket. You don’t want clay and gummy dirt because it’ll form a seal and the water won’t move through. But if you could get clean, washed sand, that’ll be perfect. Basically, you’ve got now the beginnings of a particulate filtration system. You can pour pond water through that and the sand will trap a lot of the mud and clay and all that garbage. NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 55"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"You can make this even better by having a layer of activated charcoal or activated carbon. You can make this yourself. All you have to do is take a bunch of wood and have a pile of that and set it on fire. When the fire is raging, cover that fire to deprive it of oxygen. When you do this, the flames go away and it smolders. It starts to just turn all the wood into charcoal. After you’ve done this for a few hours, you can take the cover off. You can hose down all the charcoal gently; you don’t want to destroy the charcoal. You don’t want to spread it around much, but you can hose it down to end any more burning. Then you let it dry out in the sun the next day. Then all you have to do is take a hammer or a hatchet and start beating that charcoal into charcoal dust. It’s a messy job. You’re going to get black charcoal all over yourself, but you’ll end up with charcoal powder. You make a layer in your sand bucket – your filtration bucket – for the charcoal. Typically, the way to do this would be, starting from the bottom of the bucket, you would have gravel. Above that, you would have a layer of sand that might be two inches. Then above that, you would have a layer of the charcoal. Finally, above that, another layer of sand. The reason you’re doing it that way is because you don’t want to put your layer of charcoal right above the gravel or you’ll lose the charcoal. The charcoal will go out through the sand and you’ll lose it out of the bottom of the bucket. Remember, with a system like that, you do have to run some water through it first to kind of rinse it, and to kind of stabilize the charcoal with the sand. The first time you pour water through it, that water will be black because you’re rinsing out the free charcoal. Don’t go to the store and purchase charcoal briquettes for your outdoor stove for this, because those charcoal briquettes are usually laced with a lighter fluid or some kind of fuel that is toxic. You don’t want that in your water. If you could go buy charcoal that’s just pure charcoal and doesn’t have any extra accelerants added to it, then that would actually be a good choice. You could stockpile some of that, and you could make water filters out of it to augment some other filters that you may have purchased. I should just note, as a disclaimer: Water filters that you make yourself obviously won’t have the same level of quality construction, quality control and testing as commercial water filters. I’m talking about building them and using them in an emergency, and usually to augment an existing water filter. For example, you have a Big Berkey gravity filter that works great. You don’t want to pour pond water directly into the Big Berkey because you’ll clog it up. You pour the pond water into your charcoal-sand trap system first. Then you take the water that comes out of that, which should be clearer than pond water, and pour that water into the Big Berkey. It’s a two-stage filtration system, and you’re using your homegrown filter to get the bulk of the dirt, mud and particles out of the water. You’re getting that out in your pre-stage filter so that it extends the life of the Berkey filter that you’re using. These are some smart ways to use water filtration. Now we’re going to cover some important topics about water handling, water production, and so on. Let’s start with the idea that it’s a good practice to have a non-electric way to harvest and move water. If you have a shallow enough aquifer, you can drill a well and put a hand pump on it. You’d be surprised you can have a hand pump on wells that are even a couple hundred feet deep. I’m not saying that it’s easy to pump all that water up all that vertical way, but it can be done. I’ve done this before. You can put a hand pump to your well; you can work that well, and after the first 30 pumps, you start to get water, depending on how deep the water is. I think this is a very good idea, and some of you may be lucky enough to live in an area where there’s water closer to the surface. You might start to get water in five pumps. Just remember that this water coming out of the well may be contaminated with arsenic and other heavy metals; and it will almost certainly have traces of pesticides, and so on. Be sure to run it through a carbon block filter or some other filtration media before drinking it. I wouldn’t want to just drink raw well water these days without treating it in a pretty serious way. NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 56"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Second item here: You can collect water even if you don’t have a roof. You can collect water with a tarp. It’s very simple to do this. Get the biggest tarp that you can find, and for each of the four corners, tie them up onto tall posts, or maybe onto the edge of a building or whatever you have, and just make sure that one end of the tarp is higher than the other end. You’re creating a funnel, and the rain will fall on the tarp, and it will funnel into the center of that tarp. Then you can have a collection barrel where that center is. The water will roll right into the barrel. You can set this up temporarily. If you’re moving around a lot – if you’re mobile, camping or bugging out – you can use a tarp to collect water, and you can use that same tarp as an emergency tent or shelter type of thing as well. You’re going to need some paracord for this or some rope, and you’re going to need to be able to tie tight lines in order to pull this off. If you want to reference my video, it’s up on PrepWithMike. com . I have a video there where I had to tie tight lines between two objects. These are essentially Boy Scouts or Cub Scouts skills, how to tie certain types of simple knots to make it like a rope pulley between two trees and pull it really tight, have a very tight line. You can suspend a tarp with that. You need just some basic knot skills. So, check out that video at PrepWithMike.com. I did two basic knots for you on a tabletop setup using paracord to show you how to do that, in case you don’t already know. Frankly, a lot of people actually don’t have basic tying skills these days because it’s not a very common thing that people have to do. Next topic is carrying water for long distances. If you’ve ever had to carry your water – and I mean buckets of water for filling toilets with water, or water for cooking, or water for personal bathing; not even showering, I’m talking about just a sponge, a bar of soap and a bucket of water – even that amount of water is very tedious to carry. Water is heavy. You may already be in a calorie restriction scenario here with a lack of food. You don’t want to burn a bunch of calories carrying water around. There are a couple of things you can do here. Number one, always use gravity wherever you can, and a PVC pipe or some other kind of channel system to let gravity move that water for you. For example, if you’re collecting off a roof – maybe you have a shed or a barn – but you need that water closer to your house, you can probably set up some kind of a funnel system and some PVC pipe, and you can let gravity bring that water to you. The second option is to use a cart on a bicycle or tricycle or quadricycle. I actually like these quadricycles that have four wheels; they’re great. You can buy a bicycle cart, like a towable cart that you put behind a regular bicycle – you can attach that. Then you put your water in the cart and just pedal. That’s a very efficient way to move water because you’re not fighting gravity. All you have to do is expend enough energy to have that lateral distance. This gets back to something I mentioned in my previous course, the Global Reset Survival Guide, which is about always having a bicycle. If you can, have maybe a tricycle, like an adult trike, a three- wheeler or a four-wheeler. There’s an online company called Rhoades Car. It’s a human-powered car. It’s a bicycle with side-by-side seating. With companies like that, you can often request that you want to purchase one of these quadricycles with tubeless tires, which means there’s no bicycle tubes in the tires. Instead, they use regular air pressure to seal the tire against the rim in the same way that an automobile does. This makes the tire thorn-proof and a lot easier to maintain (a lot less hassle), and you never have to buy inner tubes. You just have to buy some anti-flat filler stuff, like that green goo that you buy at the hardware store, and pump that into the tire. And if you ever run over a nail or something, the hole seals itself. These kinds of tools, devices and quadricycles are very, very important for being able to move heavy things around, including soil. If you’re trying to start a garden, make sure that you have a way to move soil efficiently, where you’re not burning 5,000 calories a day, because you may not have enough stored food for that. Or you can move the soil in advance. Start a garden now, have it ready and have garden beds in place so that you could use gasoline or modern engines before a collapse. That’s really the best way to set that up. Speaking of gardens, make sure that you are considering the water used in growing food. NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 57"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"This is something that a lot of people tend to overlook. It turns out that outdoor gardening, or what we call open-air agriculture, is extremely water- intensive, and certain types of crops, such as zucchini, melons or even tomato plants, will use a tremendous amount of water, especially if the soil beds are open beds. Also, if you’re in a drier climate, the leaves will transpire more water out of the soil and into the air. Strongly consider growing your food in a water conservation type of system. There are hydroponic systems, but they require electricity for pumps and for keeping those pumps and circulation going. Several years ago, I actually designed – and we now sell – a non-electric off-grid emergency food production system called “The Mini-Farm Food Rising Grow Box.” I think the website’s still up – FoodRising. org – where you can see that and see the videos. It’s basically a hydroponic system, except it requires no pumps, no electricity and no circulation. It’s a gravity-fed, gravity valve-controlled, automatic irrigation system. It’s a very simple system. It’s actually based on an agricultural technology that’s used in the country of Taiwan, which is really a suspended root system, a plant Raf system that suspends roots partially in air and then partially in a nutrient-rich water solution. I’ve used this method for many years. You can grow all kinds of things with it. My wife and I have grown green peppers and red peppers, we’ve grown zucchini, tomatoes, all kinds of herbs, different types of lettuces (they are super easy to grow), basil, oregano and cilantro. These kinds of things are super easy to grow in this system, and they require no electricity and very little maintenance. You don’t have to remember to water the system because it’s watering itself. You do have to refill a large barrel every once in a while; but it uses very little water. These systems actually use about 5% of the water of open-air agriculture – or maybe it’s 10% -- but it’s somewhere around there. It’s a small fraction of the water that’s used in open-air agriculture. If you’re putting a lot of your muscle effort into moving water around and you need to grow your own food, make sure that you’re using a food-growing method that is very efficient with water, so you don’t expend a lot more effort than you have to. The Food Rising Mini-Farm Grow System, I think we still have them for sale at HealthRangerStore.com . I know we’re still producing them from time to time because some of the parts are 3D printed, and I know we’re running a bank of 3D printers to produce some of those valve parts. I think those are available for a while, and the funny thing is, right now, a lot of people are suddenly seeing why that system is so valuable. I’ve invented that system based on that technology from Taiwan because I knew that people are going to need to grow food in a non-electric, off-grid emergency situation. And that’s exactly what that system is all about. That’s what makes it work. That’s its intended application. HealthRangerStore.com/SurvivalTower NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 58"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Let’s talk about water storage around your house or your apartment. Let’s say you don’t have a yard; you don’t have some land. You’re in an apartment and you’ve decided for whatever reason, you need to ride out this collapse in your apartment. Don’t forget you can store water in your bathtub. There are companies that make bathtub-sized plastic, like a giant water container or water bag that you can put in your bathtub. Fill that up and it’ll store maybe a hundred gallons or something like that. You can buy large water bags and store them indoors. The 55-gallon drums are very useful for this purpose. Just be aware of two things. Number one, you’re going to need a hand pump to get the water out of that drum, and usually, those are rotary pumps with long stems or necks that you submerge all the way down into the bottom of the barrel. Then secondly, be very sure that whatever you’re storing water in can support the weight. Let’s say you have fifty gallons in a large drum, and each gallon of water weighs somewhere around seven pounds. That’s 350 pounds right there in one barrel. If you start stacking those up in a room, you can put thousands of pounds of weight in a room that perhaps is not designed for that kind of weight, so make sure that you’re not going to crush the floor beneath you when you’re storing water. It is very, very heavy. One of the best uses of stored water that I’ve seen before is in a greenhouse environment, where I’ve seen people use black water drums – like 55-gallon drums that are black – against the North wall of the greenhouse so that it’s absorbing sunlight coming in from the South during the winter months. What happens is the water becomes a heat magnet or a heat buffer of sorts. It absorbs the heat from the sun during the day. Then at night, those barrels release that water into the greenhouse. This is very useful in cold climates and double as water storage. You have both an emergency water supply, and you’ve got a heat-retaining wall made of water barrels. The only thing to watch out for on this is usually, this is done in cold climates where temperatures during some time of the year get well below freezing. You’re very likely to see these water barrels freeze. Be sure that you have accounted for the expansion of the water in these barrels. You don’t want to fill them all the way up. If they’re polyethylene barrels, they will contort a little bit and that’s okay. If you know it’s going to freeze, you might want to unscrew the lids a little bit so that when the water expands, it can push the air out the top without popping those lids off under extreme air pressure. In other words, just make sure you’re ready for the expansion of the water. If you don’t think about it in advance, you can end up rupturing your drums and causing all kinds of problems. Another topic to cover here is greywater usage. When you’ve gone through all this trouble to collect water, make sure that you use it more than once wherever possible. If you have water that you’re using for bathing or water to wash dishes, then obviously this water can go into a greywater channel, which may be used for irrigation of your orchard or your garden. Typically, you don’t want to have toilet water on your garden, not even just urine water on your garden. It’s not such a great idea to do that. You don’t know what somebody might flush from that particular toilet someday. You don’t want that in your garden. Be wise about this. When you start looking at a greywater system, even makeshift ones, you’ll realize that you really have to have two sets of plumbing in your house. One set of plumbing is for the black water that you want to go into the septic system or into the municipal sewer system. Then you have a totally separate plumbing arrangement that is for greywater that’s going to go out to water trees or an orchard, or maybe even a garden. When you do this, you have to be extremely careful not to purchase or to avoid purchasing soap products that contain toxic fragrance chemicals, which is virtually all the dish soap that’s sold at the grocery store. Almost all of it contains toxic chemicals. It also means that you need to stop using toxic lotions. NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 59"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Most people, when they use a lotion, it’s full of toxic chemicals. It smells horrible; I can’t stand it. They can’t even smell it because they’ve been poisoning themselves with their toxic Johnson & Johnson skin lotion for so many years. Their entire olfactory sensory bank has been burned out from these toxic chemicals. If you’re using these types of products, which for most people includes toxic laundry detergent, they’re highly toxic and full of fragrance. These also include toxic shampoo. For some reason, people just love to poison their hair with shampoo that just smells atrocious. When you bathe – after having used these toxic products, then, of course, the bathwater that may go into your greywater system that you’re dumping on your garden is now full of all this toxic crap, which is going to end up in your food. You’re going to end up eating the poison that you were once wearing and that you should have avoided in the first place. In other words, people who buy and use a lot of toxic products probably shouldn’t use greywater systems, and typically they don’t. It’s kind of a self-resolving problem. They’re not into greywater. They don’t even know what it means because they’re really not into any kind of green living or ecological living or sustainable living or off-grid living or anything. They’re just standard consumers who are going to the grocery store, buying all kinds of cancer-causing poisons and putting them on their bodies. Then they take a shower in city water, which is full of cancer- causing chemicals. Then this goes into the sewer system, which goes back to the city, combined with all the other toxic chemicals from everybody else in the city. Then they take that, they make biosludge out of it and they dump it on the farms. The farms produce the food that goes back into the grocery stores that these same people eat. They’re living this cycle of cancer and neurological poisoning. They’re living this cumulative cycle of toxic substances. Then they can’t figure out why they got cancer or why they have liver disorders or why they have kidney disease. You could explain it to these people, but honestly, they don’t want to hear it because they don’t think that the products they buy are unsafe. They’ll tell you things like, “Well, if it were dangerous, the FDA wouldn’t allow these to be sold.” The FDA allows prescription drugs to be sold that kill over 200,000 Americans a year. It’s like a jumbo jet falling out of the sky every day. They allow that, so why wouldn’t they allow you to get killed by some other toxins that are in some personal care products? The truth is, some people can’t be helped. They can’t be reached. They’re so far gone and they love the way their toxic laundry detergent smells. They think it smells clean. They think that clean means artificial fragrance chemicals. They actually have a smell that they associate with cleanliness, whereas somebody like myself and perhaps you smell that that is filthy full of chemicals; but to the average consumer, they think that’s super clean and smells clean. “This is the smell I associate with clean.” If they were informed, they would associate that smell with cancer, and people like that will often end up on chemo because they believe in chemicals. HealthRangerStore.com/SurvivalLaundry NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 60"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"When they get cancer, they’ll say, “Oh, hit me with more chemicals. That must be a shortage of chemicals that has caused this cancer,” or when they feel depressed because they have so many chemicals in their body, they’ll say, “Well, that must be a shortage of antidepressant chemicals. Let’s go to the doctor, get a prescription. Let’s go to a pharmacy. Let’s go drive through the CVS here and let’s get some more chemicals.” Then, of course, that goes into the sewer system after they urinated out and the cycle repeats. I know this is a little bit off-topic, but I do want you to understand that none of us are really isolated from the planet here. I’m not trying to sound like some kind of climate change “greeny” or anything like that. But pollution is real in terms of chemicals, heavy metals, toxic pharmaceuticals and so on. That’s all real. It matters where you get your food. It matters what you use to irrigate your food. It matters what you put on your body. It matters what you wash your clothing in. Most people today are washing their clothes in cancer-causing toxic chemicals and they don’t even realize it. A lot of these people are not going to do very well in an off-grid situation when they have to live in their own feces. It’s not going to be pretty. This is a good reason to move over to natural products, to get rid of these toxic chemicals. If you’re going to be living off-grid – if you’re going to be using greywater to water your garden – you’ll want your food to be clean. The only way to do that is to have a clean life in your house, have clean products on your body and have clean clothes that are not full of crazy fragrance chemicals. It really comes down to an entire lifestyle. If you want clean water, you’ll have to live a clean life. If you want clean food, you’ll have to live a clean life. If you want to be healthy by consuming clean food, then you need to encourage that entire cycle of natural sources of food, nutrients, water and all these things. It’s all connected. There’s this hydrological cycle that you’re living in. You’re part of it. I think off-grid living would be a great wake-up call for a lot of people so they could finally realize where their water comes from and where it goes. Right now, people flush a toilet and they forget about it. They don’t think anything of what they’re putting into that system. They think it just disappears into a vortex somewhere. But no, it comes back around. It comes around in your food. It ends up back in your grocery store because every city in America uses human sewage as fertilizer on food crops. Everywhere you buy food, if it’s not organic, it’s grown in human feces. Just alerting you to something that maybe you weren’t aware of. The authorities run around knocking on the doors of farmers saying, “Hey, would you like some free nitrogen fertilizer?” And the farmers say, “Yes, dump it here,” so they dumped the sewage. They have trucks full of sewage. They’d dump it on the farmer’s fields. It kills everything, by the way, except the flies. It kills the birds, the squirrels and the forest, but it brings all kinds of flies and sometimes birds. It’s extremely toxic. You can learn all about this in an entire documentary that I produced on this called Biosludged. You can watch that film at Biosludge.com . It’s free of charge to download and watch. For a lot of people, if they are forced to live off-grid, grow some of their own food and collect rainwater, they will end up being way healthier as a result, for all these reasons that I’ve just mentioned. For some people, a collapse might be the best thing that ever happened to them because it would break the cycle of suicide via chemicals that many people are kind of trapped in right now. Let’s wrap up this chapter on water and allow me to just review very quickly here. For sources of water, you’ve got rainwater, well water, surface water and municipal water. Always have backup plans. NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 61"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Rainwater, in every case – even without a collapse – should be your number one source of water. Even if nothing bad ever happens, set up a rainwater system and make sure you have a backup system that could be well water or municipal water, which is usually well water. Finally, surface water should be your last-ditch option because you don’t know the quality of it. Be sure to run it through a pre-filter and then filter it again through a tested commercial filtration system, like a Big Berkey. In all these cases, make sure that you are sanitizing the water because algae can grow, bacteria can grow and viruses can persist in water, depending on its source. You do not want to get sick with cholera or an E. coli infestation in the middle of a collapse. People die from E. coli even when all the hospitals are up and running. Imagine if you’re in a grid-down scenario, you’ve got no electricity, maybe no communications. You can’t even get to the hospital. Maybe you forgot to buy anti-diarrhea medicine. Maybe you don’t even have some chlorine dioxide or something that could be an emergency medicine to kill bad bacteria or colloidal silver. You’re out of luck and you’re in bad shape. You might be vomiting; you might be having diarrhea. Not only are you suffering and maybe risking your life in that situation, but you’re also not able to defend yourself against the zombies. The zombie mob comes when you’re on the toilet. You’re in a bind. You need to be able to stay healthy in order to defend yourself. You also need to be productive. You need to be able to keep up with the gardening, and you need to be able to protect your food production from varmints and rabbits that are out looking for free garden food. You need to be able to function. You need to be able to remain healthy and alert. You can’t do that when you’re sick. Water is the number one vector through which people get infections in a collapse scenario. It’s not from scraping themselves on barbed wire or something like that. It’s actually through water. Waterborne disease kills more people all around the world right now than any other vector of disease, including the coronavirus. Waterborne disease is the number one killer. Maybe malaria is number one and water is second. It’s those two things, mosquitoes and water, those are the top vectors, for sure, of deaths that are killing people all over the world. Make sure your water is clean and your survival plans will go much better. No question about it.

We’re going to talk about natural antibiotics, the dealing with intestinal parasites, how to grow herbs, how to distill herbs, how to juice herbs, how to check the safety of herbs, and things like that. Herb extraction techniques. It’s going to be a really powerful chapter for you. You’ll gain a lot of great information. Be sure to continue with chapter five on herbs. Thank you so far for sticking with me on this. I really enjoy sharing this information with you, and I want you to do well. I want you to survive. I want you to have this knowledge, and I want you to share it. I’ll just say as a side note, you have permission to share this audiobook and the PDF file with anyone you’d like. You can copy the files onto a thumb drive and hand it to a friend. You can post it on Dropbox and share it with a friend. You can email it to somebody. You can post a video on YouTube with this chapter if you wish. This is kind of an open-source project for the benefit of humanity. Thank you for your support. Be sure to share this. You do have my blessing, if that’s something that you think can help other people because, frankly, we are all in this together – at least those of us who are survivors. Even though the total population of humanity is going to sharply contract in the years ahead, there will be many of us like you and I who will survive, and we need to help each other to rebuild society. Maybe we can rebuild a society without so much toxic pollution. That would be amazing for the future of the human race. Learn more at Naturalnews.com .

An herb can refer to almost anything that’s from the world of botany. I want you to understand right up front here why we care about herbs and what it is that makes them special. When you look up the definition of food, food typically comes from plants either directly or indirectly. Food contains calories. Food contains minerals, which are atomic elements, and food also contains phytochemicals, or plant-based chemicals also called phytonutrients. These are synthesized by plants. Vitamin C is a phytonutrient, and rosmarinic acid found in rosemary is a phytochemical. There are tens of thousands of different molecules that are synthesized by plants as they sprout and grow, like sulforaphane in broccoli or EGCG in green tea, which has an antiviral effect when combined with zinc. Plants synthesize molecules, whereas non-living things do not synthesize molecules – except in a pharmaceutical factory by a synthetic method. In the world of food versus herbs, you could say that empty calories – you might be able to say that’s food, but I don’t consider it to be fully food. What sets herbs apart is that herbs synthesize special molecules. These molecules, we can call them medicine. They’re not synthetic, they’re natural. And they only come from plants. Pomegranate extracts or pomegranate seeds come from the pomegranate fruit. It contains powerful anti-cancer and anti- inflammatory components. We’ll also talk about oregano and its antibacterial components. Pycnogenol is the brand name for a maritime bark extract that has remarkable anti- inflammatory properties for your arteries and entire cardiovascular system. It comes from trees or tree bark. If you look across the world of Chinese medicine, you’ll find that most of the ingredients are derived from plants. It could be their bark, leaves, seeds or pollen, but more often than not, it’s the synthesized molecules in the specific types of herbs that are used in Chinese medicine. For example, there is a Chinese medicine called ma huang, also known in English as ephedra, that contains a stimulant called ephedrine. This stimulant was used as kind of a weight loss supplement, extracted and isolated many years ago. A lot of people tried to overdose on it, and some of them had heart palpitations, so the FDA banned the herb ma huang. The herb, when it’s in fully synergized form as a full-spectrum herb with hundreds of different phytochemicals in, it poses no such danger to individuals. Chinese medicine practitioners know how to use ma huang in a formula combined with other herbs to balance the body’s response. HERBS AND EXTRACTS Chapter Five NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 64"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"There are so many examples of this. I could talk about licorice root. You can get it as a supplement. One of the chemical components inside licorice root is called glycyrrhizin. Glycyrrhizin is a liver-protective substance that halts liver damage caused by acetaminophen, which is also known as Tylenol. Also, glycyrrhizin blocks liver damage caused by alcohol. Many people – tens of thousands of people – a year suffer from permanent liver damage in the United States because they take Tylenol and drink alcohol at the same time. This causes permanent liver damage and liver scarring, but you can block that by taking licorice root in advance. Licorice root contains glyczyrrhizin. Glyczyrrhizin is created by the licorice plant. It’s not like the plant finds this molecule in the soil and brings it in. We can talk about cinnamon. What is cinnamon? It’s ground-up tree bark from the cinnamon tree. Where does the cinnamon tree get the cinnamon? It makes it, creates the cinnamon. It synthesizes it all by itself. This is true across the entire plant world. Plants synthesize powerful medicinal molecules that have benefits to us that go above and beyond minerals and calories. It is crucial to understand that we don’t eat herbs for calories and we don’t eat herbs for minerals. We eat herbs because of these special medicinal molecules that they create. In the context of survival, we need to understand the role of herbs; otherwise, you can make crucial mistakes. For example, if you’re planting a garden, you might say, “Oh gosh, it’d be awesome in this garden if I had basil and cilantro, some oregano and some rosemary,” and you’re growing all these herbs, and that’s great. You’re going to have a lot of really healthy immune-boosting, anti-cancer and anti- inflammatory molecules that grow naturally in those plants. What if you forgot to grow a source of calories like potatoes, onions or carrots? You need calories as well from other types of foods. When I talk about carrots, we typically would say, “carrots are food, not herbs.” We’re not eating carrots for the medicinal value of the molecules in them, although carrots do have lutein and beta carotene and some other things in them that are useful. But that’s not their predominant purpose. Carrots are used as food, even though they have an overlapping herbal value. You have to think strategically about what you’re growing and what it’s going to provide you. Remember, you can get minerals from food, and you can get minerals from simple supplements, such as zinc sulfate or other types of minerals, like magnesium malate, and so on. You can’t get these herbal molecules in supplement form unless you grow the herbs, extract the molecules and somehow preserve or maintain those molecules without destroying them. Unless you’ve stockpiled a bunch of herbal extracts, you’re going to have to end up growing your herbs in a survival scenario to get the things that you need, such as quercetin, which is found naturally in onions. So, there’s another case of something you can grow as food that also has a medicinal benefit. That’s one reason why it’s so good to grow onions, garlic, turmeric and other types of root vegetables – different tubers that you can use as both food and medicine at the same time. In summary, if you end up growing just herbs and not foods, then you will end up dying of starvation, surrounded by lots of medicine. That’s not a good strategy. Make sure that you balance your planning here so that you end up with the right ratios of all these things. When it comes to growing herbs, many of these can be grown indoors on a window sill. If you have control over your indoor climate and can keep it at a relative warmth level even in wintertime, then you can still grow many of these herbs on a small scale, just by using the light come in from a window. You can also use indoor grow towers or a greenhouse, or seasonally, you can typically grow them outdoors on a larger scale. NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 65"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"It’s much more efficient to grow them when they’re in season, and this means becoming knowledgeable about harvesting and then drying or preserving those herbs. I am going to talk about that quite a lot in this chapter, how to dry or preserve herbs, and then how to extract the molecules that you want out of herbs. Understand that many of these herbs are like basil. In a basil leaf, there is powerful medicine, but you don’t need the fibers of the leaf. You can get fiber from just munching on celery or from eating an apple or an orange. You don’t necessarily need the fiber in the basil leaf; that’s not its purpose. And you don’t need the calories from basil. What you want from basil are the medicinal molecules, and there are probably hundreds of them in a single leaf. The key is to extract those things, preserve them and not waste your storage space by storing bulk dried leaves that are mostly just fiber. That’s not going to give you any special benefit. When we talk about the extraction methods, we’re going to talk about concentration methods as well to concentrate these molecules. Let’s jump right into harvesting these herbs. I’m assuming you know how to grow herbs. We’re not going to cover the gardening here – that’s a whole topic by itself – but don’t use toxic pesticides. Use natural sprays that can keep the bugs off of them. Keep it natural so that when you extract the molecules, you’re not tainting your end product with toxic herbicides or pesticides of any kind. You’ll need to harvest many of these herbs a little bit each day during the growing season. Other herbs, you’ll have to harvest at the end. Obviously, it depends on what kind of herbs it is. I always say, be gentle to the plants when you’re harvesting. Don’t overdo it. Allow the plant to recover. Many of these herbs will continue to produce for many, many months, and some of them will just keep producing practically forever, as long as you keep growing them and providing water, soil and warmth. Some of these are basically pharmaceutical factories or herb factories that will just keep producing for you. When you grow your herbs, you can offset the planting times. You could plant one plant every week so that through your harvest, you’re spreading out the end product over time. That way, you’ll have a little bit of harvest each week. That way, you can use these herbs in salads or foods or as seasonings. You can basically have fresh herbs for many months to come. Let’s talk about preserving these herbs. In my view, there are really just a couple of ways to do this. I like to harvest the herbs and wash them immediately and gently in water. I like to wash off the dust and any bugs that might still be on them – aphids or whatever is trying to eat them. I often wash the herbs in a bucket, just rinse them off. You could also use a salad spinner and wash the herbs. At this point, you really have three options. Number one, you can eat them fresh and you should, as much as you can eat them fresh in salad. Basil leaves are really great in salads. Cilantro goes great in salsa and many other dishes. But eat them fresh whenever you can. Secondly, you can dry them. You can dry them in an Excalibur food dehydrator, or you could dry them under the sun. Just use the sun as a drying mechanism. The problem with the sun is that UV light will denature and destroy some of the molecules in the herbs. You will lose some potency by drying them under the sun. HealthRangerStore.com/SurvivalTurmeric NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 66"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Thirdly, you can put them straight into alcohol or another type of solvent to make a tincture. This is, I think, the best way to make natural medicine. You can use a mostly alcohol substance, like 180 proof vodka, which is 90% alcohol. Other times, I like to use a 50:50 mixture, 50% alcohol and 50% water; for this, you absolutely want to use distilled water because distilled water will pull more nutrients out of the herbs than any other kind of water. You don’t want to use heavily mineralized well water or tap water or anything like that. Rainwater is fine if it’s been filtered and purified, but use a 50:50 mixture of alcohol and water. That’s a very good extraction recipe. Some people like to use vegetable glycerin as an extraction solvent. The problem with vegetable glycerin is that it’s not a very good solvent. Very few plant molecules can be effectively extracted into glycerin. Curcumin is one of the molecules you can get from turmeric. You could do a glycerin extraction of turmeric root. In fact, we make that, and many other people make it themselves, and those are quite delicious because the glycerin is fairly sweet. If you want a more potent extract of turmeric, you should make it yourself using alcohol and water. Those are the three basic things you can do with your herbs after you harvest them. Eat them fresh, dry them, or put them into a solvent, such as alcohol and water, in order to make an extraction. A quick note on drying them: After you do dry them, put them in a bag of some sort – even a vacuum- sealed bag would be great. It’s not a bad idea to refrigerate them at that point, because if they stay at room temperature, they will degrade over time, especially since they have lost some of their structure from being completely dehydrated. They don’t have the cell structure that they used to have when they were living and fresh. Let’s talk about extraction. If you’re using alcohol extraction or water extraction or a combination of both, there’s a slow way and there’s a fast way to do it. The slow way is to just use a jar. I like really large mason jars with a wide mouth. You can stuff the jar completely full of herbs and then fill that jar with alcohol or alcohol/ water, depending on what ratio you want. I tend to go with 50:50 for most things because it’s just a general all-purpose extraction solvent. Water and alcohol together will extract more things than just alcohol alone. Some things are more water-soluble. We find this in the lab when we do these extractions to test foods for glyphosate. We found that water is a very strong solvent for a lot of foods and herbs because it pulls out many, many substances that cannot be pulled out by methanol or isopropyl alcohol. Go with the 50:50 solution if you’re not sure what to use. If you do this in a jar, you’re going to need to shake that jar, maybe every few hours, or maybe once a day, as these herbs sit in that jar of alcohol and water, which you want to keep away from light. Over time – over a period of several days or several weeks – you will have an extract. The more frequently you shake it, the sooner you’re going to have your final extract. There’s no general rule of thumb for this, but you can’t overdo it. If in doubt, let it sit longer. Once you’re done, you can then pour out the alcohol/water, which now contains the soup of the herbs You pour it through a very fine strainer, something like a five- micron straining bag, so that you really get out the excess particles. Then you have a tincture, and you can put this into a smaller jar or eyedropper bottles or any glass container. You can store these and keep them cool in a dark place, and they will store typically for many, many years. If you have more alcohol content, they will tend to store much longer. That’s the slow way to go about this, and it’s perfectly fine. At other times, you’ll be in a hurry. You’ll want to make those herbs more quickly. This is the preferred method that I use, and it’s using an ultrasonic homogenizer. In the laboratory, we have high-end ultrasonic equipment that cost like $5,000 or $6,000. You don’t need that. It turns out, you can just go online and buy an ultrasonic jewelry cleaner, or an ultrasonic gun parts cleaner. Often, you can get them made out of stainless steel or just plastic. You can get these anywhere from $50 to $200, and they use very little electricity. They have ultrasonic transducers in the bottom. NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 67"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"You fill them up with your herbs and your alcohol/ water solution, and you turn them on. They have that high-pitch ultrasonic sound, and over just a few minutes, they will extract your herbs in a very, very effective way, saving you literally weeks or months of time via the slow method. We’ve done tests on this in our laboratory, and we found that ultrasonic extraction lasting just a few minutes really is better. It’s better than a slow extraction method that takes many months. There’s nothing magical or special about having herbs sit on the shelf for months to get a “stronger extraction.” You can do the same thing in about 20 minutes with an ultrasonic device. The good news is, you can also buy what are called frequency sweeping ultrasonic devices. You can even buy these on Amazon. What these do is they sweep the frequency from low frequency to high frequency, and then it just repeats. This turns out to be extremely effective, and the reason is because different molecules resonate at different frequencies, and different cell structures or cell masses also tend to resonate at different frequencies. If you have an ultrasonic machine that only works at one frequency, that may or may not be a very efficient frequency for the specific molecules that you’re trying to extract from whatever you’re working with, like licorice root and glycyrrhizin. If your ultrasonic extractor is sweeping through these frequency ranges, then it’s going to hit the resonant frequency of your herbs at one time or another throughout that range. It’s going to keep hitting it as it continues to sweep. We found that these provide a much more efficient extraction, and these tend to cost maybe $200 or $300, perhaps in stainless steel models that can hold quite a large quantity of herbs. Just as a safety note, I would add that you could use heat settings. Some of these devices have heat settings; however, recognize that when you’re using an ultrasonic process on something that contains a high percentage of alcohol or IPA, its vapors can be ignited. If you’re using a heat setting on your ultrasonic extractor and it gets overly hot and has just the right conditions, you could have a spontaneous fire. For this reason, I typically recommend that people don’t use heat settings, and I don’t use heat settings. I found that there’s no need to, even though technically, it will extract a little faster. But I’ve found that ultrasonic extraction, even at room temperature, is so efficient that I don’t need to use heat. Then I don’t have to worry about possible spontaneous ignition. When you use these ultrasonic devices, be alert, be attentive. Don’t leave them unattended. And also, have a fire extinguisher handy just in case you have some kind of fire problem, although that’s a general rule of thumb for everyday living. Using this method that I just described – growing herbs, harvesting herbs, washing them with water, putting them in an ultrasonic container, adding 50:50 vodka/water, which gives you roughly a 50% to 50% ratio of alcohol versus water – you can extract almost anything. I need to add a safety note here. A few minutes ago, I did mention isopropyl alcohol that we use in the laboratory. That’s for extractions that we don’t drink. You should never drink isopropyl alcohol (IPA). You should only drink alcohol that is sold and intended for human consumption, such as vodka. If you were to drink isopropyl alcohol, it would cause damage to you, obviously, because it’s intended for first aid use. They actually add a toxic chemical to that alcohol to prevent people from drinking it. Just be careful about your source of alcohol. The safest thing to do is to go buy vodka, just straight-up, cheap Russian vodka, the cheapest you can find. There’s a lot of cheap Russian vodka out there. That’s what you can use. You can stockpile that in a safe way; and not only is vodka a barter item, it’s also a first aid item because it’s a natural antiseptic, and it can be used to extract medicines from herbs. This is one reason why I’m stockpiling vodka, even though I don’t drink alcohol. Nevertheless, it is sometimes difficult to convince the cashiers at the alcohol store that I don’t drink alcohol when I’m buying cases of vodka, but that’s for them to figure out. You need some vodka in your stockpile for all these reasons. NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 68"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"For this section, we’re going to talk about what I call a secret cancer cure, which involves ionic silver and the extract of a specific herb. When you combine these two things, you can create silver nanoparticles. These nanoparticles are biologically compatible with your body’s cells and tissues because on the outside, they look like components of a medicinal herb, but on the inside, they carry a payload of silver, which helps destroy tumor cells. There are a lot of disclaimers for this section here. Number one, this is experimental medicine, for research purposes only. None of this has been proven in clinical trials, except for the nanoparticle creation, which is proven. We have sent off samples to an electron microscope company, and we actually have the images of that, and we’ve confirmed the silver content. The composition of what I’m talking about is proven. It’s just that the efficacy against cancer cells is not proven in clinical trials. This is for experimental purposes only, and you would only even consider using this in an off-grid scenario, end of the world emergency scenario. It’s not intended to replace the advice of a naturopathic oncologist. If you have cancer, you should work with a naturopath and get a proper diagnosis and proper treatment. I’m using naturopathic principles. This is not intended to replace any of that, but it is information that I think could save a lot of lives, and it’s information that I promised to release to the public. I found out after I made that promise last year that we could really get attacked and shut down for releasing this information if it’s too public – if we do a big article on it and make a big video and talk about how to make your own anti-cancer medicine – because the cancer industry is very powerful. They don’t want people to have access to these cures. They would try to suppress us, so I’m hiding it, I’m burying it in this Survival Nutrition course. Just consider this to be a big bonus. This is how to make your own anti- cancer medicine, at least as best I know how. Remember, there are many, many things that are anti-cancer. Garlic is anti-cancer. Onion is anti-cancer. All kinds of herbs are anti-cancer. All kinds of fruits, including pomegranate fruit, and all kinds of nutrients and vitamins, such as vitamin D, and minerals like selenium, are anti-cancer. The truth is, most people who have cancer have been exposed to either toxic foods or toxic chemicals or toxic substances that led to that cancer. In some cases, people are just looking for a cure so that they don’t have to change their lifestyle. They look for a cure so that they don’t have to stop eating a cancer-causing diet or stop smoking cigarettes. I’m completely against that. The people who have cancer, usually if they just change their lifestyle and if it’s an early-stage cancer, it goes away. It reverses itself because your body wants to stop uncontrolled cell growth. There’s even a cellular process for that in your body called cell suicide. If you have the right nutrients in your body, you can balance your immune response to cancer cells and actually have normal cell division in your body. Most people don’t have good nutrition, and people are exposed to a lot of toxins. Even in their laundry detergent, people are using toxic chemicals like crazy. People lead a very unhealthy lifestyle overall. HealthRangerStore.com/SurvivalMouth NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 69"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Let’s get right into the information here because this could be really life-saving. Let me first describe what we are creating. We are creating silver nanoparticles, and there’s a lot of literature on this. They use components extracted from herbs on the outside of the molecule, and on the inside of the molecule, there is a silver element that is attached to the molecule. The silver element is very, very tiny, while the rest of the molecule is usually very large in comparison. Imagine a giant cargo truck carrying a ping pong ball. The ping pong ball is the ionic silver and the cargo truck is the extracted molecule from an herb. In this case, we’re talking about the rosemary herb, and in particular, the molecule is called rosmarinic acid. If you search for scientific literature on rosmarinic acid plus silver, typically, they use the term colloidal silver, although technically, we’re talking about ionic silver because the silver has a positive charge before it combines with the rosmarinic acid. If you look at the scientific literature, you’ll find that this is actually a well-researched method for creating nanoparticles that are used in medical research and targeted drug delivery in advanced medical processes. It’s not like this is completely out of the blue or some wild theory. This is actually documented in medical technology. The thing is, I was playing around with this a year ago in our laboratory. I found that it’s super easy to create these nanoparticles. I did some research and I found out that the proper molecule for this is rosmarinic acid, because that molecule is very rare in Nature: It can transmorph itself. It can absorb an oxidation state and maintain its structure. This allows the rosmarinic acid molecule to take on the positive charge of the ionic silver and to attach to the silver, all while basically functioning as a food-looking molecule in your body. What I’m going to describe to you here is a simple method for making this solution yourself. It’s really absurdly simple to do this. When you think about the amazing technology that it encompasses, I can’t believe how simple it is to make this. Here’s what we’re going to do: We’re going to use an ultrasonic machine to extract molecules from rosemary herb, and we’re going to use water as the solvent. Let’s call this extract R. You can grow some rosemary or you can buy some bulk herb. Put it in some water in an ultrasonic machine that you bought online. I like to use stainless steel; and you might say, “how much herbs should I use and how much water should I use?” Look, I don’t know. You’re going to have to take your best guess at this. You’ll want more than enough water to cover the herbs. You’ll want all the herbs to be saturated in the water, but you don’t want excess water. You don’t need to make a lot of this for reasons that will become apparent. Keep it small. You can make a quarter of a liter, or 250 milliliters of liquid. Rosemary, the dried herb, you can get that bulk online. Use organic; otherwise, you’re going to be extracting pesticides into your medicine, which is not a good idea. You can also just grow your own rosemary herb. The best advice on this is let the herb soak for a couple of hours before you turn on the ultrasonic machine. By letting it soak for a couple of hours, you will soften up the dried herb. Then when you do the ultrasonic extraction, you will get a more complete extraction. This will turn the water kind of a reddish, brownish, more brown color, actually. The darker brown it is, the more nutrients you’re extracting from the rosemary herb. When you’re done with this, it might only take 20 to 30 minutes of ultrasonic extraction. Pour the resulting liquid through some kind of a filter. It could be a coffee filter, a bag filter or any kind of filter, just to get the particles out. You’ll end up with a liquid – which is a rosemary extract – that is kind of a tea-colored liquid. This is perfectly safe to taste. I wouldn’t chug it because it’s pretty strong. Taste a few drops or a partial teaspoon of it. It should taste like, “Whoa, this is rosemary.” That’s how you know that you’ve done the right thing here. NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 70"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Use distilled water if you can for this extraction process. It works better. You could use rainwater. I try not to use well water or city water for obvious reasons, because city water is toxic. You now have solution R. You’ve got a couple hundred milliliters of this rosemary extract solution R. Set that aside. Next, we’re going to make ionic silver. There are lots of ways to make ionic silver, and this is what you want. Ionic silver, not colloidal silver. Ionic silver is a clear liquid; it’s usually perfectly clear. It contains very tiny silver ions, which means silver atoms with a charge, a positive charge (AG+). These silver ions are equally dispersed throughout the liquid. To make ionic silver, you can buy what’s typically called a colloidal silver generator or an ionic silver generator. Or, you can go to my online video that shows you how to make this yourself using two silver coins, a couple of clothespins and three nine-volt batteries, plus some alligator clips and a jar of distilled water with a tiny amount of baking soda and a TDS meter. It’s really easy to make this yourself, but you can buy machines that will make it for you. They usually have silver electrodes, just two silver wires that stick down into the water. You run the machine and it energizes the silver wire, causing silver to be ejected off the wire into the water in a charged state. Then based on the conductivity of the water, the device will automatically turn off once a certain part per million level is achieved. I should let you know that for this experiment, you want a very low PPM, such as five PPM, because when you’re making silver, if you go too high on the PPM, you end up accidentally making colloidal silver clusters rather than ionic silver particles. Anytime you’re running one of these machines and trying to energize silver wire or silver coins or something that’s suspended in the water, when you first start doing this, you’re making mostly ionic silver. Over time, as the conductivity of the water rises, you end up accidentally making silver clusters, which is colloidal silver, and that’s not what you want at all. One way to know that’s happening is that the water starts looking yellowish, or even brownish. If you’re making silver and you start to see a yellow hue, you should stop. True ionic silver should be totally clear, or if you’re making silver water. When it turns brown, you’ve gone way too far, and you need to dump that out and start over because that silver may be only good for scrubbing your toilet. In a video that I posted on Brighteon.com , I showed how you can make it using silver coins. The reason this is so interesting is because silver coins – many people stockpile those because they want silver, which is a store of wealth –can be bartered or used for payment. Most people will accept silver, especially as the dollar loses value. You can use these U.S. Mint silver coins as electrodes to make ionic silver. What’s great about that is that in the U.S. Mint, the silver coins are 99.9% silver. Since I own a laboratory that has a mass spectrometry instrument with elemental analysis, I decided to make ionic silver using U.S. Mint silver coins, then test the result to find out what was the elemental composition of the other 0.1%, because I was curious. If I make ionic silver or colloidal silver with silver coins, is it safe to drink? I made the silver. I took it to my lab. I ran it on the mass spec. It turns out that it’s 99.9% silver, and the other 0.1% is mostly zinc, with very small amounts of a few other things, such as nickel – nothing that I would consider to be too harmful in an emergency situation. That answered my question. Now I know that I can use silver coins to make ionic silver. HealthRangerStore.com/SurvivalDefense NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 71"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Whatever method you use, you will need to make some volume of ionic silver. You can also purchase it. There are companies that just sell the silver, colloidal silver or ionic silver. How much? Well, let’s keep this experiment on the small side. How about 500 milliliters of silver? Just to keep it simple. You’ve got your solution R, the rosemary herb extract that you’ve set to the side, and you have your ionic silver solution, which is mostly water with positively charged silver ions in it that you can’t see because they’re invisible and because the liquid looks clear. Your rosemary herb extract should be kind of brownish-looking and your ionic silver should be clear. We’re going to combine these in a ratio; and this isn’t an exact science, but I’ve done some testing of what’s the saturation point. It turns out that you only need a small amount of the rosemary extract compared to the volume of the ionic silver that you’re using. Kind of a good rule of thumb on this that will make sure you achieve full saturation is to do it 1:10, which means 1 part rosemary extract, or solution R, and 10 parts ionic silver. If we have 500 milliliters (ml) of ionic silver, then we would want 50 ml of the rosemary solution. In truth, that’s actually way more than you need. We’ve done this with a lot less. Fifty ml to 500 of the silver- water, that will saturate all the silver ions in there. As you pour solution R into the ionic silver solution, I encourage you to stir it. What you’re going to notice are color changes. What’s going to happen is that the silver ions in the solution are going to be chemically attracted to the rosmarinic acid molecules that are in the rosemary extract that you made. As these ions interact with the molecules, you’re going to notice a color change in the solution. It’s going to turn more of a deep red color. This is the formation of nanoparticles. What we’ve done is we’ve taken that solution, and we’ve sent it to an electron microscope laboratory, the one in Houston. They were able to see its image under the electron microscope and give us measurements of the exact structure of the result in molecules, as well as the micron sizes. I intended to publish that photo – I may yet do so – but I guess I’d have to explain everything. Like, what is this, what are you looking at? That’s kind of a long explanation for going online with this. Plus, I don’t want the FDA to try to raid my lab or something. But it’s a really fascinating photo, and it shows that this process is very successful. Plus, you can see the color change with your own eyes. This resulting liquid, which you might say contains the silver nanoparticles or CSNP, we were able to take it and analyze it using the mass spec instrument that we have, just to confirm that it contains silver. And it does. It contains the silver at a lower concentration than the original colloidal silver because now it’s diluted. If you taste the solution, which I have done personally, it tastes like the rosemary extract. That’s of course because it contains all these molecules from rosemary. The theory of this – and you could say the experimental nature of this – is that if someone were to drink some reasonable amount of this substance under the supervision of a naturopath, his body would recognize it as just rosemary food molecules. These molecules would go into his blood and then his blood would pump it around. NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 72"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Cancer tumors always have an extra blood supply coming to them through the process of angiogenesis. They actually build blood vessels to give themselves more resources to grow. That’s why they keep growing bigger and bigger. Since these silver nanoparticles are circulating in your blood, they would end up being absorbed and taken in by these cancer tumors that think they’re getting food nutrients. And then, boom! There’s a silver payload in there. According to some of the literature – and this is where this is in an experimental stage – silver nanoparticles may be selectively toxic to certain types of cancer tumors. We need more research on this point. We need more comprehensive clinical trials; but, of course, the NIH, ACS and the FDA are not interested in colloidal silver. This research will never be done; but you can do some of your own research on this. According to much of the research that I’ve seen, silver nanoparticles are selectively toxic to certain types of cancer tumors and cancer cells, whereas the silver is nontoxic to your body’s healthy cells. This has to do with the unique properties of silver that also make it an antibacterial agent. How does silver kill bacteria? It works in a very unique and intriguing way, interfering with the cell membranes – the cell walls of bacteria – and depriving the bacteria of the normal metabolic processes they need to survive. If you do this inside tumor cells, you can compromise the integrity of those tumor cells and cause them to die from the inability to bring in new resources. It’s kind of like, you could say, experimental chemotherapy that targets specific cells. If you look at the medical research on nanoparticles, you’ll find that drug companies have many patents on these. You’ll find that nanoparticles that use specific elements are being used by drug companies for targeted drug delivery – that is, for targeting specific types of tissues that have specific receptor sites. Drug companies are spending hundreds of millions of dollars doing this kind of research. You can make this stuff for 50 bucks at home with a jewelry cleaner, a little ultrasonic machine, a little bit of rosemary herb and a couple of silver coins. It’s really advanced technology from Mother Nature. You don’t have to have a hundred- million-dollar lab to do this, but drug companies are working on this exact concept to target drugs to the nervous system or target drugs specifically to heart cells, or target drugs to liver cells. They use different elements. It’s not always silver. I’ve seen research on gold nanoparticles as well. I’ve seen drugs that are surrounded by a gold outer shell and carried by some other nanoparticle. It becomes this payload that delivers this in the cells. Gold is used because gold is considered neutral and inert, basically. It doesn’t interfere with the chemistry of these substances. It’s quite interesting. Gold has many medicinal uses that you may not be aware of. There are many different elements that can be used for this. It just so happens that silver is, in my view, medicine by itself. There are other herbs that are also viable candidates for this research. I’ve even made a list. It’s called Bacterial Pathogenesis and Antibacterial Control: Green- Synthesized Silver Nanoparticles and Their Potential for Anti- bacterial Applications. That’s a major study about creating silver nanoparticles and how they work. HealthRangerStore.com/SurvivalNasal NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 73"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"There are other plant metabolites, such as polyphenols, that are called the Natural Reducing Agents and Natural Capping Agents for the Creation of Metallic Nanoparticles Stabilization. That study is in the NIH, and it says that we have to consider that green nanoparticles have the advantage of a functionalized surface due to the presence of bioactive molecules, such as proteins, polysaccharides and polyatomic alcohols. I’ve got a lot of studies on this. I should probably do maybe a whole big report just on this, but let me read to you something from this one study. “Here’s a simple 15-minute method: Take ionic silver at five parts per million and mix it with two parts of Rosmarinus officinalis leaf extract. Just combine and mix at 60 C for 15 minutes, and then you can purify it in a centrifuge if you want. You can then create pellets in deionized water.” This is what they use for Big Pharma. Then they use a vacuum drying chamber to dry this into a powder. This becomes a silver nanoparticle powder carrying a specific herbal leaf extract. There’s another study that’s on ScienceDirect. com : Antibacterial Effects of Biosynthesized Silver Nanoparticles Using Aqueous Leaf Extract of Rosemary. Aqueous just means water. This is basically what I just described to you, how to get a water extract of rosemary herb that’s a natural antibacterial substance. This is inspiring me, just reviewing this research again. I’m going to film this part of it, how to get a rosemary herb extract using the ultrasonic system, so look for that on PrepWithMike.com . I’m absolutely going to do that because I’ve got all the equipment right here. I should just put on camera to make it easy for you. Here’s another study that’s in the International Journal of Nanotechnology from 2010 by Sarkar A. It’s called the Synthesis Stabilization and Surface Modification of Gold and Silver Nanoparticles by Rosmarinic Acid and Its Analogs. The study says: “Rosmarinic acid and its analogs, caffeic acid and dihydrocaffeic acids, were not only able to reduce gold and silver ions, but they could stabilize nanoparticles in these noble metals.” When they say reduce gold and silver ions, what they mean is leave them with a neutral charge by combining them with rosmarinic acid, dihydrocaffeic acid and so on. To stabilize the nanoparticles in these noble metals, you need to create a nanoparticle delivery system, and that’s what I just described to you. You can do it yourself. You don’t need a million- dollar lab to get this done. Here’s another study called: Kinetic Study on Green Synthesis of Silver Nanoparticles Using Coleus aromaticus Leaf Extract. C. aromaticus basically looks like oregano or something similar to oregano. I’ve seen other research on this that talks about using cinnamon. I’ve seen research that talks about green tea extracts. Many other herbs have come up in this research. Here’s another study: Green Synthesis of Silver Nanoparticles Using Leaf Extract of Rosmarinus officinalis and Its Effects on Tomato and Wheat Plants. For that, they used 50 ml of rosemary leaf extract and an aqueous solution of one millimolar (mM) ionic silver. One mM, which is 1/1000th of a mole, is a very, very small concentration. Consider all this to be in the experimental category; but I wanted you to know about this. I want to make sure this knowledge gets out to the public because I haven’t seen anybody else covering this. I don’t think there’s anybody else in the industry of survival and natural medicine that also has an atomic spectrometry laboratory and is interested in colloidal silver or ionic silver solutions with ultrasound and using herbs to make nanoparticles. This is like right down my little geek aisle. This is the kind of stuff that I’m into when I’m not signing in rifles and so on. This is really interesting stuff to me, and I want to pass it on to you. I will film how to make the rosemary extract and you can find that on PrepWithMike.com .

I think this could help a lot of people. This is really lifesaving information. Of course, we need more research to be certain about the efficacy of this on certain types of tumors and so on. But I think this is really valuable stuff, and I intend to use this as emergency medicine if I have to. If we’re in a survival situation, I know how to make this stuff. It’s super easy to make. Just need a little bit of silver and some rosemary. Before we move on to the next section here about herbs, let me give you a quick update. I did take a break from recording this audiobook in order to film the videos showing how to use an ultrasonic cleaner to extract natural medicine from herbs. That video is now posted. You can find that video on PrepWithMike.com or on Brighteon.com , the YouTube alternative for free speech videos. In doing that, it reminded me of the importance of covering all the different methods of extracting these medicinal molecules from herbs. I want to go through that with you here to explain some of the different methods because there are lots of ways to do this. One of the methods is called decoction. Decoction is used in Traditional Chinese Medicine and is basically boiling a pot of water and throwing a bunch of herbs in it. Decoction then softens the herbs and frees up the medicinal molecules that you’re trying to get out of them. This works great for bark, tree bark, stems and leaves, things like that. This is why you use decoction to make tea. Every time you’re making tea, you’re creating a decoction. You are extracting tea molecules out of the tea leaves. And then you throw away the tea leaves because that’s what’s in the teabag. You don’t need to drink the leaves; you just want the medicinal molecules out of the tea. The simplest way to extract from herbs is to use a decoction. The drawback to this is that, for many molecules, you don’t want to subject them to the very high temperatures of boiling water. Some molecules will be destroyed. Other molecules, such as volatile, organic molecules, will also be lost in the air. As you’re boiling a pot of water, the volatile organics will just go into the vapor and they’ll be gone. To capture those, you need to use a distillation system. Distilling herbs usually means doing steam distillation. Distilling herbs is a little more complex, and you have to have a distillation setup with the big glass vial – usually a round, bulb-shaped vial. You stuff a bunch of herbs in that with some water at the bottom, and then you put heat underneath that. Then as the vapor goes out the top, you cool that vapor through a large coil-shaped glass tube that has high surface area contact with the air around it so that the air is cooled. And then the volatile organic chemicals that you’re looking for will condense out of the air, turn into liquid and drop down as a liquid into a receptacle container. This is how you make essential oils. Where you go buy essential oils like peppermint oil, clove oil or rosemary oil, they use a steam distillation method. You can do this yourself. It doesn’t use any electricity if you just use a Bunsen burner type of setup. You can make the setup yourself, but you have to buy the glassware from an online source. Between these two methods that we’ve talked about so far, decoction versus distillation, what matters is the chemistry of the molecule that you’re trying to get out and what allows it to be set free from either a flower, tree bark or leaves. Different methods work for different molecules, so you need to know what molecule you’re looking for. The ultrasonic extraction method that I covered earlier is a replacement for decoction. The advantage of ultrasonic extraction is that you can do it at relatively low temperatures. You don’t have to boil it in order to get those molecules out. This preserves the more delicate molecules in those herbs that often end up being more medicinally potent molecules. This is why I really like ultrasonic extraction. It keeps the temperature low, is very fast and is just as effective as a boiling water decoction. In addition to these methods, there is alcohol extraction. That’s when you pour vodka into a jar after you’ve stuffed that jar full of your raw herbs. And then you shake that jar once a day for many weeks. The alcohol will extract the content out of the herbs. It’s extracting the medicine. NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 75"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Then when you’re done a few weeks later, you pour that through a filter and you have your herbal tincture alcohol extract. This is a simple way to do it, but what you need to know about this – and I don’t hear people talking about this much – is that alcohol only extracts certain molecules from the raw herbs. It may leave behind other molecules that you actually want. We know this because I run a food lab. We do a lot of extractions in the lab every day because we’re testing foods and supplements and raw materials for all kinds of things, including pesticides and herbicides. We have to make extractions, so we have a lot of experience with that. What we found is that water extractions tend to pull out a lot wider variety of molecules from food or herbs compared to alcohol extractions. Alcohol extractions might be right for you if it happens to work for the specific molecule that you want to get out. But if it doesn’t work, it may leave behind molecules that are of interest to you. Don’t think that an alcohol extraction is actually stronger than a water extraction just because the alcohol seems like a stronger drink. It’s not really the case. In many ways, water pulls out more molecules than alcohol. In a laboratory environment only, we will use other solvents that are toxic to drink. You wouldn’t ever want to use chemicals like acetonitrile and methanol. There are other extremely toxic solvents that we typically try not to use, such as hexane or DCM. You probably won’t have those at home, and you won’t want to mess with those because they are toxic. Wheat berries don’t just have pesticide coating on the outside. It’s actually grown in the wheat because the crop has been absorbing these pesticides while growing. The pesticides are locked into the cells. How do you get those out? We found a variety of techniques for doing this. Again, the bottom line is, the best way for most things is ultrasonic extraction using water, even just warm water. That works for most cases. Note, however, that it will also pull out pesticides and herbicides. If your herbs are not organic, you’ll be making pesticide tea, which is not a good thing. A lot of people drink tea – like the regular tea that you get in a restaurant or in teabags at the grocery store – not knowing that they’re actually drinking pesticide tea because they didn’t buy organic. Pesticides come right out into the water. Yes, they’re there. We can see them on the instruments; they persist. They don’t go away just because the tea was dried. They are inside the tea leaves, and they come out when you add water. Since we’re talking about survival scenarios here, it’s worth mentioning that you have a juicing machine in your mouth. It’s called your teeth and your saliva. You can extract the nutrients in herbs, foods and so on just by chewing on them and having your saliva work as an extraction solvent. Then you can spit out the food after you’re done chewing on it. If you have to – I’m not saying that you would want to do this as your first choice – but if you have to, in an emergency situation, you could pick herbs like dandelions or even most common grasses. You can chew on them and chew the nutrients. You can chew on it for many, many minutes in your mouth. You can get the nutrients out of those herbs, and then you can spit those herbs out. HealthRangerStore.com/SurvivalOils NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 76"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"We talk about drinking wheatgrass juice. Well, you can make wheatgrass juice in your mouth. I’m not saying it’s a pleasant experience. I often joke that I’m not into licking the bottom of a lawn mower. To me, wheatgrass tastes like that. I don’t really drink wheatgrass juice. I think it’s nasty. I like my superfoods to be pleasant. That’s why I make superfood smoothies all the time with avocados and bananas in them. In a survival scenario, you could literally chew on grass and extract nutrients from it, even protein and enzymes and chlorophyll. You could do this while you’re doing other activities for food production. In other words, while you’re working on doing some sprouting or you’re planting some potatoes or you’re planting seeds to grow some lettuce, you could be chewing on herbs, maybe something that you wild- harvested out of your backyard or out of a forest behind your house or something. Know what you’re eating, have good identification. You can be extracting nutrients while you’re working. It’s pulling nutrients out of fibrous foods. There’s a reason why we don’t eat grass. But why do goats and cows eat grass? Because they have special enzymes that can break apart the cellulose. They have multiple stomachs. When I look at my goats in the evening, they’re just sitting there on the driveway. They’re chewing. You know how they say a cow just chews its cud or goats will just chew on food they had swallowed earlier? They’ll kind of regurgitate it back up into their mouth and chew it more. Then they have special probiotics and enzymes and so on to break the cud apart. Well, we don’t have that. We don’t have multiple stomachs. I strongly suggest that you don’t swallow all that grass fiber; they won’t agree with you. It turns out that if you chew on an herb, swallow the juice and spit it out, and that herb is toxic to your system, your body will typically – not in every case, but in most cases – respond with knowledge in the form of making you vomit. In fact, this is the method that Native Americans and Indigenous people all around the world have used to try to find out, “Hey, is this food okay to eat?” I’m going to talk about that actually here for a minute. This is called a sampling method. You take a small piece of the food, chew on it, swallow the juice, spit the food out and then wait a few hours to find out if you’ll vomit. If it’s bad for you, typically you will vomit. You don’t want to do this with mushrooms because some mushrooms and certain kinds of really bright berries are fatal. They are acutely toxic. People die every year from eating wild mushrooms because they don’t know what they’re doing. Don’t play this game with mushrooms. In a survival emergency, there are a few clues that you can follow to see if certain types of wild foods might be safe for you to consume. Number one is to observe animals that are mammals. If you see rabbits eating something or you see wild hogs eating something – in Texas, they eat the wild onions that are buried in the ground. If you see horses eating something, this is an indicator that it might be safe for you to consume. It’s not a perfect system because goats and horses and so on, they have multiple stomachs. They can handle a much wider variety of food than humans can, but it’s an indication that it might be something to experiment with. Secondly, do a small sample of that food. If you don’t know what it is, take a very small sample, chew it up, swallow the juice, spit it out and see if you’re okay. Some of the symptoms you may experience if it’s bad for you include dizziness, nausea, weakness, sweating, breaking out in chills, digestive upset, diarrhea and so on. It is a sketchy way to go about things. It will be much better to have a bunch of food buckets in your house somewhere. If you had to bug out and you’re out in Nature and you’re trying to survive, these are some tips that you can use. Birds will eat a lot of things that you can’t handle. What birds eat is not necessarily the same as what you can eat. However, birds do eat a lot of bugs and, in a pinch, you can eat bugs, too. I’m not saying it’s going to be delicious, but you could capture a bunch of grasshoppers and crickets and you can fry them up in a pan. Then you can pound them into powder, like an insect flour. You could eat that flour. NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 77"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"In fact, there are companies out there right now that are selling protein powder made from crickets. I’m not buying that stuff and I’m not saying you should, but if you were trying to survive, you can live on grubs. You can live on crickets. You can live on grasshoppers. You can live on many things that you might not want to eat because if you’re starving, you might consider it. It just depends on how hungry you are. While you’re looking for grubs, you can be chewing grass and getting the juice out of the grass and spitting that grass out. These are extreme survival situations. Hopefully, you don’t find yourself in this situation where you’re down to the crickets option. If you’re down to crickets, a lot of things have gone wrong. You’ve lost your house, your bug out vehicle and your backpack. If you’re down to crickets, things are bad. But as every air force pilot knows – they’re trained in survival innovation tactics – you can survive on bugs for quite a while, if you’re willing to just stomach it. With that said, let me get back to the extraction methods. That bug-eating stuff is kind of grossing me out. I’d rather have fresh herbs and fruits and vegetables that we can juice. You can buy juicing machines and there are the cheap juicing machines that basically just kind of shred your vegetables, carrots and beets using spinning blades. These kinds of juicing machines can be acquired for (sometimes) less than a hundred dollars, and they’re fine. They do an okay job. They waste some of the produce, but not a lot. It is a good way to extract juice. You can also buy these hand-crank juicers, such as wheatgrass juicers, that can crush herbs or grass. These are best used for things like parsley, cilantro and wheatgrass. If you try to stick a carrot in one of those, you’re probably going to jam it up. I recommend you have many different ways of extracting nutrients from foods. When it comes to getting the maximum amount of juice or nutrients out of foods – conducting an extraction method, that is – I do want to remind you that you need some fiber in your diet. The best kind of fiber is fruit fiber. I do things where I’ll juice vegetables and throw away the vegetable pulp, which is very high in cellulose, such as celery pulp or carrot pulp. I’ll juice those vegetables, I’ll take that juice and put it in a Vitamix, and then I’ll blend it with fruits – the full fruit – such as apples or bananas or oranges, or whatever the recipe calls for. You can do some very pleasant apple-carrot type of blends, but I’d rather use the carrot juice and not the carrot fiber. You can even do like an apple-celery-mint type of recipe. I would put the whole apple in there minus the core. I would put the apple with the peel in the Vitamix and then juice the celery separately. I’d take the celery juice and pour that into the Vitamix and then add some mint. That’s a really delicious way to do that. You’re getting the benefit of the fruit fibers without all the bloating and gas and discomfort of overdoing a bunch of celery fiber. Know the difference between fruit fibers, which are rich and packed, versus vegetable fibers. Fruit fibers are really good at absorbing heavy metals and then ferrying them through your digestive tract and out through bowel movements. Fruit fibers are natural detoxifiers. Anytime that you’re eating something that has been burned, such as barbecued meat or something that you suspect might be higher in heavy metals, such as shrimp or fish, you should always eat those meals with fresh fruit, with the fiber, such as a whole apple or an orange or grapefruit or a mango. Have fresh fruit with it and you’re going to protect your body from a lot of those toxins. Since we’re talking about sampling different types of foods and maybe accidentally encountering some poisonous foods, if you’re in a survival situation, it’s very good to have activated charcoal at the ready. Activated charcoal neutralizes poisons in your stomach. In fact, emergency rooms across America have kind of a cherry-flavored, activated charcoal oral product. NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 78"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"If someone comes in with poisoning of some kind, they’ll usually have that person drink a large amount of this activated charcoal. It has a blackish color. Activated charcoal adsorbs an enormous array of chemicals. It will adsorb, not absorb; there’s a difference in chemistry. It adsorbs pesticides, herbicides, poisons, toxins, heavy metals and all kinds of toxic molecules. One good tip here is to have a large amount of activated charcoal ready as a dietary supplement. You can buy these online. You can get bags of activated charcoal and you can spoon it. You can just eat it. You can blend it in a glass of water and just drink it. It’s going to turn your teeth black temporarily. It tastes kind of nasty. If you’re out sampling wild herbs but you don’t know exactly what you’re doing, and you’re trying this technique of sampling an herb and then swallowing the juice then you start to get dizzy like, “Oh my God, this has got a toxin in it. I’m losing my balance or whatever;” or you start to feel weak or fatigued; then what you can do is immediately – if you’re not already vomiting – consume the charcoal. The charcoal would adsorb those toxic chemicals, often in mere seconds. Then that would stop your body from further absorbing those toxins in your stomach. Activated charcoal is used as a dietary supplement by a lot of people. It’s part of a detox habit. People will eat typically psyllium husk and activated charcoal to detox. Psyllium husk, I almost regret even mentioning it because psyllium husk can be very dangerous. People tend to overdo it and not drink enough water. Psyllium husk will form this giant gum stoppage and it just clogs your digestive track. And sometimes, you have to go to the emergency room to open it back up. Even just a spoonful of psyllium husk can do that without adequate water. If you try anything that includes psyllium husk for detox, I recommend using extremely small amounts of it, like a quarter of a teaspoon, combined with enormous amounts of water, like a 12-ounce glass of water. You do not want to get in a situation where you’ve consumed psyllium husk and you don’t have enough water. I just mentioned that because many people are using activated charcoal together with psyllium as a kind of colon cleanse. Some people will combine that with really harsh herbs like cascara sagrada, which is an herb that gives you extreme diarrhea. Some of the detox supplements out there that are labeled colon cleanse supplements, they will often be a combination of cascara sagrada and maybe a little bit of psyllium, plus a little bit of charcoal. They can definitely clean out your colon, but it’s not a pleasant experience so you should go easy. Often, I try to tell people you don’t have to be a detox hero. More pain is not more gain when it comes to detox. I know that’s a little bit off the subject here on Survival Nutrition, but if you get into this detox stuff too aggressively, you will find yourself in a survival emergency on the toilet – not a pleasant thing. Be very, very careful about that. HealthRangerStore.com/SurvivalWheatGrass NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 79"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Getting back to the main point of this whole section, this is about the different ways you can extract medicinal molecules from herbs and from food. We’ve covered quite a few of them here, ultrasonic extraction, decoction, alcohol extraction, chewing with saliva as an extraction method and distillation for the volatile organics, such as essential oils. The final thought on all of this is to remember that you are also a giant juicing machine. Your body is a juicing machine. That’s the whole point of digestion: If you eat something, like grain or corn tortilla, your body’s job is to break that down and extract the nutrients, then defecate out the waste product that could no longer be processed. The thing to understand in this – and this really shocked me when I was working on a digestion simulator in the laboratory. This was a few years back when I was working on two patents that have since been granted. One of them is called cesium eliminator. This is a dietary supplement invention that absorbs radioactive cesium-137 and takes it out of your body through the digestive tract so that it doesn’t go into your blood. I built a digestion simulator for this to use for research on the composition of stomach acid and bile, the whole process of probiotics, how it goes through in the lower intestinal tract, and so on. I was really shocked by one thing – that stomach acid is very weak. We tend to think of stomach acid as being highly, highly acidic. “Oh, it’s just going to rip apart all the molecules and extract everything.” No, it’s not like that at all. Stomach acid is a very weak acid. It doesn’t do a good job of breaking foods down. In fact, what I learned is that your stomach relies on physical action just as much as it does on the acidic chemical breakdown. When you eat, if you don’t have some level of physical activity like walking around afterward, then your body won’t be doing a very good job of breaking down those foods. Even more importantly, if you don’t chew your food sufficiently, you’re going to miss out on a lot of nutrients. But maybe when you were growing up and you were at the dinner table, your mom said something like, “chew your food, you’re not chewing it enough.” Well, she was right. Moms are often right. Because if you don’t chew your food, you’ll end up with relatively large chunks of food going into your stomach. As large chunks, they are not broken apart by your stomach acid. Not at all. They stay as chunks. Have you ever seen corn in your own stools? Like, you ate corn on a cob and then some X number of hours or days later, depending on your digestive tract, there’s corn on your stools? Well, if you’ve ever seen that, that’s proof of what I’m talking about. Guess what? Your stomach acid didn’t break down the corn. You must be going, “wait a second, I thought that I digested that corn.” Actually, you didn’t. It went right through you. You didn’t get any nutritional value out of that corn. And it’s not just corn that does that. A lot of the foods that people eat, they end up wasting the calories, wasting the nutrients. They’re not getting the full value out of them. Normally when we’re living in an environment of accessible food where everybody’s got food abundance, and you can go to a buffet for $19.95 and have all- you-can-eat food, you pack on 5,000 calories. We tend not to think of chewing as an important step in extracting the nutritional value from your food. In a survival scenario, you should absolutely chew your food twice as long, or maybe more, compared to what you do normally. They say you should chew each bite for at least 30 seconds. Some people say longer, like 60 seconds; I can’t even imagine that. But you need to be able to create a sufficiently broken-down paste to go into your stomach, and your weak stomach acid has to be able to break apart that paste and get the particle size very, very small. Your body can’t absorb nutrients out of large chunks, and it doesn’t. Much of the food that people are eating today is absolutely wasted from a nutritional point of view. The only reason this doesn’t matter is that we have so much extra food and very few people are starving right now compared to the total population. I understand that food scarcity is an issue for many people, but for the population at large, it isn’t, and so people waste a lot of food. NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 80"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Just remember this when you’re in a survival situation: If you have a one-year supply of food but you don’t chew, it becomes more like a nine-month supply of food, or maybe an eight-month supply of food. It’s only one year if you chew it. You’ve got to get the nutrients out. This is also a good reason to blend foods. You can use a Vitamix if you still have electricity. You can make soups that are blended, hot soups. You can make sauces, dressings and dips using blended ingredients, and you can also make delicious superfood smoothies. The advantage of all these is that their particle sizes are so small because they’ve been physically chopped up by the blender; hence, your body is able to access all those nutrients. You don’t have to chew it. You just swallow it; your stomach does the rest. Your digestive tract takes over and absorbs all the nutrients for you. I know this is probably more in-depth than the way people typically think about foods, herbs and getting the molecules out of them, and so on. These are all important concepts in the context of Survival Nutrition. You’ve got limited resources and a limited supply of medicinal herbs. Or, maybe you’ll find yourself short on protein. You need all the medicine that you can get out of these foods. Let’s say you’ve grown a kumquat tree. You need every bit of vitamin C that you can get out of the peelings of those kumquats. You don’t just pop them in your mouth and swallow them. You chew and chew and chew on the kumquats until you create a very fine paste in your mouth. Then you swallow that and let your body get all the vitamin C out. Speaking of vitamin C, there was a comprehensive study recently published that shows that vitamin C vastly improved survival rates among those who have sepsis, which is internal infections. The bodies of people suffering from sepsis usually go into almost a shutdown kind of mode. They’re not able to beat back the infection. When they go to the hospital, the doctors put them on all kinds of antibiotics, which is just kind of a passive way to beat the infections. It turns out that if you load up on vitamin C, your body’s own active defenses kick in, and you’re able to beat the infection yourself without relying on antibiotics. It’s a major study involving thousands of patients over many, many years. Vitamin C allows your body to beat infections. That actually brings me to the next topic in this chapter, which is about natural antibiotics. I kind of mentioned this earlier in a sense that most herbs have natural antibiotic substances in them because they have to create these molecules themselves in order to avoid being eaten alive by all the microbes in the soil. Every plant that has a root system, which is most plants – I’m not talking about lichen and things like that. I’m talking about regular plants in the ground. They’ve got root systems. How do those roots not get eaten, considering there are bacteria in the soil? Well, these plants create their own antibacterial medicines, and they’re often found in the roots. Sometimes, they’re found throughout the plant. Sometimes, they’re found in molecules like vitamin C. But other herbs, such as oregano, have very, very potent, specific chemicals. In fact, if you look up some of the information on oregano oil, you’ll find that most of it is made up of what are called phenolic compounds. The number one phenolic compound in a regular oil is called carvacrol. Another one is thymol, which is a minor element in it, and then cymene, terpinene and some others. These are all found in oregano oil, and they allow oregano oil to treat everything, from parasitic infections to athlete’s foot, crotch fungus, spider bites and topical infections. It treats all kinds of things. It’s really quite amazing. This is why we believe that oregano is one of the most important herbs that you can grow as a natural antibiotic. It works for such a wide variety of things; it even works for food poisoning. NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 81"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"In fact, I won’t travel without oregano oil because I’ve traveled extensively throughout South America and so on. I’ve had stomach and diarrhea issues in South America when you get some bad water. That’s something you never forget. Since then, I travel with oregano. Anytime I’m drinking a glass of water from a source I don’t trust, like some no-name bottled water brand, I will take oregano oil with it. Why? Because I know that oregano oil kills the bacteria in the water and in my stomach. What’s great about oregano is that you can grow it very easily. From what we’ve talked about here, you already know how to make your own oregano extracts, and you can do it in your mouth. In a pinch, you just grab a bunch of oregano leaves, put them in your mouth and chew, chew, chew. Swallow the juice, spit out the leaves and repeat. That is cheap but very effective antibacterial medicine, and it works. You should always have some oregano growing. Native Americans – and this is true across other indigenous populations, such as the Australian Aborigines, the Southern Taiwan Aborigines, those who rely on Tibetan medicine and even the native Indians in the Amazon – they would take herbs and use their mouth to chew them up and make a poultice. Then they would apply the poultice to the skin of the person and wrap it up with some kind of cloth or material of some kind. You can use your mouth to chew up herbs and wet them, to allow those molecules to be extracted essentially by someone’s skin, or to make a skin treatment or topical treatment. Oregano can work in this way as well. Remember, it will kind of burn skin. It will be intense if you apply it directly on skin, especially sensitive skins, such as genitalia. You wouldn’t want to use it on your eyes, nose or mouth, or anything like that. On a wound, it may have applications in a survival or emergency situation. Just remember that the mouth is also full of germs. You might be introducing germs into that poultice if it’s not strongly antibacterial. You don’t want to necessarily put those germs on something that you would put on an open wound. But for a minor wound that’s not at risk of deep infection, if you’re using strongly antibacterial herbs, you could use this method or at least consider it. Personally, I would like to have a colloidal silver first aid gel for that, plus some herbs or the essential oil of oregano. I might put a drop in a bandage or something and then spread around some colloidal silver gel that’s got herbs in it. I think that would be a great combination. You’ve got to work with what you have. Sometimes you don’t have all that stuff, but you do have a mouth and, hopefully, you’ve got some oregano growing. There’s a website that I published that is all about natural antibiotics. This website is a treasure trove of information. I encourage you to go there, it’s called NaturalAntibiotics.news. If you go there, you will see story after story, all rooted in science and medicine, about natural antibiotics. You’d be amazed at what can function as an antibiotic – a wide variety of foods, herbs, natural substances, molecules, certain chemicals, and so on. It’s pretty amazing. It turns out that oregano is not the only one. You can grow basil. Basil has certain antibacterial properties as well. There is a vast array of other herbs, such as garlic, onion, ginger and turmeric, that are antibacterial agents. Even if you extract from a fruit peel, for example, orange peels; if you squeeze orange peels, what do you get? Well, you get one chemical called d-limonene. This is an oil-based solvent. Some people actually consume this as an experimental anti- cancer type of medicine. I’m not sure if it works for that, but I’ve heard that some people do that. HealthRangerStore.com/SurvivalGel NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 82"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"The thing about d-limonene and the other essential oils that come out of orange peel if you squeeze them is that many of them are antibacterial. Same thing is true with squeezing pomegranate peels or rind. If you just squeeze them and take their juice, that juice has antibacterial properties. There are many examples of these, such as grapefruit seed extract (GSE). GSE is known to function as an antibacterial substance. Some people add it to water to make water safer to drink. Some people travel with GSE. I think there’s a company out there called NutriBiotic that makes GSE, and it’s just grapefruit seed extract. That’s not the same as grapeseed extract. Those are two totally different things. I’m talking about grapefruit seed extract. It’s quite bitter in taste. Grape seed is different. Grape seed extracts contain proanthocyanidins, or PCOs, that are good for cardiovascular health and so on. Those are very beneficial in their own way, but I was referring to grapefruit seed extract. Lastly, in this section, I want to mention manuka honey. Manuka honey is in a class of its own. It’s called manuka because it comes from honey bee colonies that harvest pollen from manuka plants. Typically, this happens in New Zealand or certain parts of Australia. Manuka refers to a certain type of plant that I think is related to tea tree. The honey that’s made from this contains molecules that are found in pollen. These molecules are such potent antibacterial substances that there are forms of manuka honey that are FDA approved to be used as prescription medicine in hospitals, especially in burn wards, among other applications. These brands of manuka honey have undergone thorough FDA scrutiny. They’ve applied for approval and they’ve received the approval. That tells you something. These are powerful antibiotics used for topical applications and for burns, cuts, scrapes and so on. Manuka honey is, in fact, incredibly powerful, but many people like to use it internally. Many people believe that it helps your body’s defenses against bacterial infections, even when consumed internally. The thing about manuka honey is it is sometimes maybe triple the cost of regular honey. Then again, a lot of regular honey isn’t even honey. There’s a lot of adulteration in the honey industry. You think you’re buying honey at the grocery store, but it’s just corn syrup or it’s blended – a combination of corn syrup and honey. It’s not real honey, but manuka honey is quite real. Since we have sourced a lot of manuka honey from Australia, we understand that you have to have this honey tested for two criteria. I’m not a honey scientist so I don’t know all the details, but I know that there are universities in Australia that do the testing and certify manuka honey to have certain levels of these plant- based chemicals, the antibacterial chemicals. If you do buy manuka honey, make sure it’s been tested, and make sure it meets or exceeds the claims of potency. These two tests produce results that are called MGO and NPA. For example, I’m looking at our online store right now, and here’s a batch of raw manuka honey confirmed by the lab at the University of the Sunshine Coast, which I think is in Australia. The MGO content is 622 parts per million with an NPA of 16.8. The NPA is called non-peroxide activity. It’s an effect, a measure of the potency of these molecules in the honey. An NPA of 16.8 is very, very good. This particular batch is promised to be 15 plus. It turns out, in the actual lab tests, it’s 16.8. Don’t buy manuka honey without these ratings because there are manuka honey brands that have very low potency, but they’re still called manuka. It’s a little bit of a rip-off. You’re paying the manuka price, but you’re not getting the manuka power. Make sure you have these high numbers when you’re buying manuka honey. NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 83"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"The advantage of all this, the wonderful thing about manuka honey, in particular, is that it’s one of these multi-purpose survival items. You can eat it, you can trade it as barter, or you can use it as medicine. There aren’t very many things that have three good uses like that. You can use this as hone and spread it on toast or biscuits. You could put it in your tea and have your honey tea. If you put it in a smoothie, it’s delicious; it tastes like really rich honey. You can barter it to people who know what manuka honey is good for. It is especially valued because of its antibacterial properties, which are well-known and well- documented throughout the honey industry. You can use it as first aid, put it in your survival kit, use it for scrapes and burns, and maybe other things, depending on how bad your situation is or how big of a collapsed society you’re facing. You might be in a situation where the hospitals aren’t functioning; where there are no pharmacies; where you can’t reach a doctor; where the power grid is down. Everything, from just a mild hurricane to Mad Max – believe me, in a Mad Max scenario, manuka honey will be very, very handy. And you can use it on animals because if they lick it, they’re just getting honey. A lot of farmers will use manuka honey. If you’ve got an animal with a wound or a cut, you can usually patch it up with manuka honey. There’s no harm if that animal or another animal happens to lick that honey off the wound, which they often do because it’s delicious. In addition to manuka honey, I always recommend that you grow aloe vera because aloe vera gives you free antibacterial gel, which is great for burns, cuts and scrapes. It is also good to eat. Did you know that you can eat aloe vera gel, which is the clear gel part of the leaf, not the brown sap part in the outer leaf that will give you diarrhea? I’ve done videos before of how to filet aloe vera leaves and just get the gel out. You can throw that in your blender and blend that up. Did you know that if you eat aloe vera gel, your body’s ability to carry oxygen is heightened? It allows your red blood cells to more efficiently carry oxygen. Would that be useful in a survival scenario? You bet it would, for fitness, for endurance, for healing, for everything. Should you grow aloe vera and eat some aloe vera gel during a survival scenario? Yes, every day. That’s why I grow loads of aloe vera. I grow figs, aloe vera, bananas, kumquats, potatoes, herbs and lettuces, things like that. Those are some of the things that I grow because they have very particular uses. Aloe vera is a natural bandage. If you don’t happen to have a colloidal silver gel handy, you can just open up an aloe vera leaf and squeeze the gel out onto a wound. It’s antibacterial. And if you were to mix that gel with manuka honey, then you would have a multifaceted, multi-vector antibacterial substance that would be very potent and very low-cost. The aloe vera is free; the manuka, you could use just a small amount to get, maybe 20 cents worth. These are good things to have on hand, good things to grow and good concepts to think about. Remember that treating infections is going to be one of the primary priorities of surviving. More people die from infections in a collapse scenario than from violence or being shot or anything else. They die from infections. They die from E. coli. They die from contaminated food. They die from scrapes. They die from drinking contaminated water. That’s actually the number one source of death in third world countries. I just saw a story in Texas – I don’t remember which city it is, but they had to declare a state of emergency because the city water supplies were infected with brain-eating amoeba. You drink that water, take a shower in that water and, all of a sudden, your brain’s being eaten by amoeba to the point where you’re dead or you turn into a brain damage victim of city water. It’s another reason why you should never drink city water. I don’t know who’s drinking city water, but it’s kind of a suicide mission if you do that. You should always filter your water. Here’s another good reason to do so: People die from infections, which means that treating infections is absolutely critical for your survival. NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 84"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"The FDA has outlawed the use of fish antibiotics that we used to be able to buy a few years ago. You could go online and you could say, “yeah, I have an aquarium and I need some amoxicillin for my fish,” and they would sell you fish antibiotics, even if you didn’t have any fish. You could just be dreaming about maybe having fish one day. Today, you can’t do that anymore. They’re all gone. You need to have alternatives to that. Amoxicillin is a very potent antibiotic. It’s also dangerous. If you don’t know what you’re doing, you can kill somebody by overdosing on it. That’s the advantage of manuka honey or aloe vera. I’ve never heard of anyone being killed by manuka honey. “Death by honey,” that sounds like a pleasant Saturday cartoon. No one has died from too much honey. Eventually, you just get full, but you can definitely die from amoxicillin and other Big Pharma antibiotics. They can kill you quite easily, whereas these natural antibiotics, they’re less potent but they’re a lot safer, which is great because people don’t really know how to use Big Pharma antibiotics unless they’re pharmacists. But even pharmacists screw up all the time. It’s really not a good idea to just start swallowing a bunch of fish antibiotics. If you don’t know what you’re doing, you can end up killing yourself. That’s the overview here of natural antibiotics, how to extract molecules from herbs and foods, natural medicines and so on. Don’t forget that certain types of tree bark are part of this as well. Cinnamon is made from tree bark and from the cinnamon tree. A lot of Chinese medicine come from tree bark, like Eucommia herb, which is a really great herb for kidney energy. I want you to take this information and start putting some of it to use. Even if you’re doing something very simple; just do a boiling water decoction. Make a tea out of something other than tea. Do it safely. Pick something that’s edible and that’s safe to consume. You can put goji berries in with something. You can have a goji berry tea. There are all kinds of fun things that you can make just by boiling water and extracting molecules from herbs. Understand all of these different methods because you may have to use these. Make sure you have mason jars on hand. Make sure you’ve got a way to filter water. Make sure you’ve got some alcohol like vodka stockpiled in case you need that for medicine. Make sure you’re growing some oregano herbs. Make sure you’re growing some aloe vera. Stockpile a little bit of manuka honey for an emergency. Start sprouting because you can also extract juice from sprouts. Make very potent phytochemicals that are loaded with vitamins. Start drinking some sprout juice. That’s some very potent nutrition, by the way; or, you can just eat the whole sprout. That’s fine, too. Start using these methods so you can become familiar with how to do this. Even as you’re living your day-to-day life right now, think of ways that you can incorporate these natural medicines into your lifestyle. Don’t always go to the emergency room if you don’t have to. Think about how you can solve problems with a safe, natural solution or something that you can make yourself.

I’m not saying don’t go to the emergency room if you have a bone sticking out of your arm or something. When you have access to emergency medical care today, and if you need it, go seek it out. I’m just saying start to become familiar with the methods of natural medicine and self-reliant medicine, so that when you do need them in a collapse context, they won’t be foreign activity to you. Just gain that familiarity while you can because you never know when you’re going to need it. A lot of these substances will need bandages, so do you have bandages? Do you have gauze? Do you have tape for taping bandages onto an arm or leg? Do you have triangle bandages? Do you have sterile gauze that you could stuff into a wound to stop bleeding? A lot of this gets into military medic first-aid type of skills, which I’m not really going to cover here. But they do overlap a lot with antibacterial medicines because you do need these bandages to hold natural medicines in place, such as aloe vera, which is really slippery. You’ve got to be able to hold it in place by putting a bandage over it. Hence, the honey. The honey makes it sticky so it stays where you want it. That’s why aloe vera plus manuka honey is such a great solution. But even then, I would still recommend putting a bandage over it to avoid introducing new bacteria to your wound. Have some gauze and some bandages, some skin tape, some safety pins, things like that. They will serve you well as you’re applying all these natural medicines. Learn more at Naturalnews.com .

This is called Elements and Chemicals. In this chapter, we’ll be talking about certain elements and compounds, such as sodium chloride, and what they mean for your Survival Nutrition plans. Before I get into that, I just want to mention that there are a great number of survival videos on Brighteon.com . There are a lot of new channels there. We have tens of thousands of users, and I’ve seen some new channels that have some really great survival talks about self-defense, about awareness on the street, how to survive an assault on your vehicle, how to bug out of a city; a lot of great survival videos on there. In fact, survival and prepping is one of the main categories of videos on Brighteon.com . Be sure to check that out, it’s really a great resource. We’ve built it. We’re funding it. It’s still losing money, but we’re subsidizing it until it breaks even. It’s been working really well, lots of free speech. People love the platform. Be sure to check that out and thank you to all of you who are posting there as well. Moving on to Elements and Chemicals. We’ve talked about a lot of topics here throughout the entire program, and yet there are some things that are missing or that we may have touched on but perhaps not in enough detail. Some things that you need to stockpile are basic elements. These aren’t products per se; they’re not food meals or finished products or branded products. They’re basic elements or chemicals that you can use for a wide variety of situations. I’ve mentioned one of them previously, which is baking soda, also known as sodium bicarbonate. I strongly advise you to stockpile a large quantity of Chapter Six baking soda. Number one, because it’s dirt cheap. Secondly, because it has so many uses around the home and also for health. It’s an alkalizing substance, so you can use it as a dietary supplement. You can also use it for cleaning. You can use it for various recipes as well. It’s very salty, but it can be used in certain types of recipes. I strongly recommend that you purchase a book about baking soda uses. I’ve seen these books before, like 101 uses for baking soda, or something like that. Get a book like that. Make sure it’s a physical book, and then stockpile baking soda. You’ll be glad you did, because when it comes time to surviving a collapse scenario, you’re not going to have all these cleaning products, like the store-bought Windex or laundry detergent, around. You’re going to have to make do with simpler substances. Baking soda has a multitude of uses, many of which are related to food and diet. Buy big bags of it. I like to buy five-pound bags of Arm & Hammer Baking Soda. You might be able to find something cheaper. The sources – I’m sure as a commercial operation, we could probably purchase this by the pallet, but that might be a little too much. I don’t need to store a pallet of baking soda, but I can definitely store 20 to 25 pounds. It’s only going to cost a few dollars. Along with that, I also recommend that you store basic unscented soaps. These could be bar soaps or liquid Castile soaps. When you’re buying soap – and, of course, we sell soap at HealthRangerStore.com if you want to support us. We have general-purpose soaps, completely unscented. We also have soaps scented with lavender, citrus and tea tree essential oil. Some of these are body soaps, some are shampoos and some are general-purpose cleaning soaps. But in truth, all these are really the same basic soap, just with different thicknesses and different essential oils because we don’t load up chemicals into anything. Whatever form of soap you purchase – it could be liquid soap for washing dishes – just make sure that it is completely unscented. Most soaps that are sold in any store are loaded with fragrance chemicals, and that really limits their use because you actually don’t want to wash your dishes with a bunch of fragrance chemicals. Some people do. A lot of dishwasher detergents are loaded with fragrance chemicals. People who use them are coating their dishes in toxic chemicals. And then they wonder why they get cancer when they’re eating off those dishes. It’s insane. NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 87"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"They wonder why they get cancer after they do their laundry using laundry detergent that’s loaded with toxic chemicals. It’s just insane. This is why I’ve created laundry detergent, dishwasher detergent, body soap and other forms of soap that are all completely unscented at the Health Ranger Store. They contain no other chemicals. They’re just the soap, nothing else. Some of them have essential oils and that’s it. This is important because if you stockpile raw soap – a basic soap without any kind of fragrance – you can use that soap in a hundred different ways. You can use it for laundry if you have to hand wash your clothes in a bucket with a washboard and a hand wringer, kind of like off-grid clothes washing. It’s no fun – I’ve done it, too. It’s a lot of work. But you’d want to use unscented soap to do that. Why would you want to coat your clothing with fragrance chemicals? Same thing goes for household use, for washing your hair or for washing your body. You just want some basic soap that is not going to introduce these other chemicals, no matter how you use it. I actually have body soap that we make at the Health Ranger Store. I use that body soap to wash my body and my hair, as well as for shaving. I don’t use shaving cream, never have. I don’t use aftershave, never have, because its full of toxic chemicals, fragrance chemicals and alcohol. Half the products sold to you in the personal care section of stores are not even necessary. The companies that sell these things fabricate demand that create need for something they’ve come up with, like shaving cream. You don’t need shaving cream to shave. The only function of shaving cream is to show you where you’ve already shaved. It’s basically just keeping track of where you’ve already moved the razor. It’s like a coloring book type of thing, but with white cream. You don’t need shaving cream to shave. It doesn’t do anything. You don’t need aftershave to shave. You could use tea tree oil if you want to close up your pores. I’ve never needed to do that. All you need is soap and water to shave, and it works every time. As you’re buying soap, I do want to mention just a political note here. Don’t support Dr. Bronner’s soap company because they donated a million dollars to the left-wing terrorist organization known as Black Lives Matter, which, of course, is burning down American cities and trying to overthrow the country. Dr. Bronner’s is another one of those radical left-wing, virtue- signaling woke corporations. They’re giving money to terrorist operations. I always say as a general rule: Don’t buy products from companies that support terrorists. That’s a good rule. In addition to baking soda and soap, let’s talk about salt. I know I’ve covered it a little bit before, but salt is a – you can call it a compound. Sodium chloride has a multitude of uses in food, but it also has some uses in cleaning and in certain formulations. You can use it to cure meat, make salted meats and preserve meat. It’s very, very potent. Salt is amazing as something to store because it lasts forever, as long as you don’t allow it to get wet. If it gets wet, it’ll absorb water, and then it turns your salt into a salty slurry or a salt brine. If you can keep it dry and out of the elements, salt can last forever. We are mining salt right now out of the Himalayan mountains. This is how we get our pink Himalayan salt. That salt has been there for hundreds of millions of years. Trust me, it’s not going anywhere in your lifetime or my lifetime, which is very short compared to the lifetime of mountains. Salt is dirt cheap if you buy it in the right way. Wherever you can get salt by the pound, I recommend you get it. For purposes of stockpiling salt for survival, you don’t have to go for the fancy salt. You don’t have to get the Himalayan salt for this purpose. Go to your local grocery store and find out how cheaply you can get salt, but also go to your local agricultural supply store, like a feed store, where farmers go. Find out how cheaply you can get salt for cows. Cows like a salt lick. You may find that it’s dirt cheap to get salt that way, and it’s actually the NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 88"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"same salt. Salt lick for cows is the same salt as salt for humans. Wherever you can find salt the cheapest, go ahead and stockpile quite a lot of salt. I would recommend having, at minimum, a hundred pounds of salt. It’d be much better to have a couple hundred pounds. It’s very heavy so the pounds add up quickly, but you definitely want to stockpile some salt because of its multitude of uses. Here’s the thing: If you’re buying salt online, for example, from my online store, it’ll be expensive because most of the costs will cover the shipping costs, whereas if you buy salt locally, you may find it a lot less expensive because it’s been distributed to your local stores via commercial shipping on pallets. This is a case where I would say probably don’t stock up on large volumes of salt from the Health Ranger Store. You’re going to pay a lot more doing it that way than if you just go out to some local stores, especially agricultural stores, and buy the salt locally. If you’ve got some connections, you might be able to hook up a way to get other forms of salt very cheaply. I know that some of you are thinking, “what about water softener salt?” You can go to a store like Home Depot or Lowe’s, and you can get salt for water softeners, or salt for pool cleaning systems. This is great if you do your homework and make sure there’s nothing added to those salts because often those products have some other chemicals in them. They’re not labeled for human consumption. They’re not designed for human consumption or even for animals to consume. Sometimes they contain other chemicals, such as chlorine and so on. I would steer away from water softener salt unless you absolutely know and are 100% sure there’s nothing else in it. Even then, recognize that that salt doesn’t meet FDA standards for food for human consumption. I wouldn’t want to put my trust in a bunch of water softener salt, even though it seems like a really cheap source for salt, and it is. I just don’t know what else is in it, and I don’t know what kind of factory it’s been run through and whether it might be contaminated with something else that we don’t know about. Be cautious. I would prefer to buy salt for human consumption. You’d be surprised to know that you can go to the grocery store and buy salt containers – just table salt – fairly inexpensively, and that’s a good place to start. Once you get the salt, make sure you store it in airtight containers, if you’re in a humid environment. This is a great use for those five- gallon pails or buckets where you hammer the lid on them and you seal them up. This works great. If you’re in a very dry climate, like Southern Arizona or Southern California, you probably don’t have to do that. Remember that salt is hydrophilic, so it loves water coming in, and it will pull water right out of the air. It will turn itself into a brine slurry if you don’t keep it dry. Next, we’re going to talk about some mineral concentrates. One of the easiest to acquire is zinc sulfate. Here’s what’s interesting about zinc. Like a lot of elements, zinc is highly efficacious for human health at very, very small doses, but it’s also extremely toxic at high doses. It’s toxic to waterways and aquatic ecosystems. In fact, in waterways, zinc is considered a contaminant and is a form of pollution; it kills fish. Zinc sulfate is the most common form of zinc, and it’s very inexpensive. If you’ve ever mixed zinc sulfate with water and tasted some of that, you will understand why it has a famous nickname, white vitriol. Zinc sulfate is on the World Health Organization’s list of essential medicines. It’s considered one of the most essential medicines in the world for basic healthcare. If you lack zinc, all sorts of things can go wrong. For example, if you lack zinc as a pregnant woman, your child will be born with a low birth weight. Infant mortality is linked to zinc deficiency. Also, for yourself, if you lack zinc, your skin won’t heal very quickly. You can have all kinds of skin problems. You can have problems with your lips; they’ll look dry and chapped all the time, even when they shouldn’t be. NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 89"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Without zinc, your immune system can’t function, and you can’t fight off viral infections, such as COVID-19 or other viral diseases. In fact, zinc has been shown to very strongly interfere with viral replication in human lung tissue. Zinc sulfate is one of the most common forms of zinc. It tastes horrifically bad, but it’s the most common form that’s used to make zinc tinctures that you might purchase online. Zinc sulfate is also used as a supplement in animal feed. For example, you can buy zinc sulfate by the pound or five pounds at a time. Just understand that zinc sulfate is extremely toxic in high doses. You have to be very cautious about how much you’re using because we’re talking about milligrams per day. Milligrams per day would be the proper dosage for humans. The zinc element is about one-third of the molecular weight of the molecule known as zinc sulfate. If you want to take 30 milligrams of zinc in a day, you could roughly triple that and say, “Oh, that’s 90 milligrams of zinc sulfate.” Ninety milligrams of zinc sulfate is still a very, very tiny amount. It’s not a tablespoon or a teaspoon; it’s not even a quarter of a teaspoon. It’s something much less than that. You need to have an analytical balance or a scale of some sort because it’s very easy to overdose on this. If you overdose on zinc, you will feel sick, and you will vomit. You can do damage to yourself by taking too much zinc all at once. Like a lot of elements, such as selenium or copper, you’ve got to get the dosage right. Copper is another one of those minerals where a little bit of copper is highly efficacious and can do a lot of wonderful things for your body. Too much copper causes schizophrenia and mental health disorders, which is why people who live near copper mines are clinically insane in huge numbers. It’s not uncommon to find a mental asylum in a small town that also has a copper mine because the copper gets into the air and falls on all the food, land crops and water systems. Then people take way too much copper and become schizophrenic, so they end up in a mental institution. You’ve got to be careful about how much copper, zinc, selenium and many of these other minerals you’re taking. If you want to stock up on zinc sulfate, you can buy that in 50-pound bags. You’ve got to understand that a 50-pound bag of zinc sulfate might be enough zinc for a lifetime. I haven’t done the math, but it’s a lot of zinc. It’s way more than you will need to get through any kind of collapse scenario. You don’t need much zinc sulfate. If you buy a pound or two, that actually seems like plenty. Also note that a lot of the tinctures and solutions that offer liquid zinc are really made from just zinc sulfate blended with water or other liquids just to dilute it. There’s nothing wrong with that. It’s perfectly safe. You don’t really have to spend the money on a zinc tincture when you can buy zinc sulfate for pennies. Then you can just take a very small amount. Thirty milligrams worth of zinc or so per day, that’s for adults; children need a lot less. Check with your own naturopath for the proper dosing for you. Remember that you’re probably also getting some amount of zinc through your diet, and you don’t want to overdo the zinc. If you’re eating a lot of meat or shellfish, you’re probably getting a lot of zinc from your diet. You may not need to supplement with zinc, depending on what you’re eating. Definitely check with your naturopathic physician about that. HealthRangerStore.com/SurvivalSoap NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 90"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Keep in mind that stocking up on small amounts of these elements in forms that can be consumed as a dietary supplement is a very smart idea, and the same thing is true with various forms of copper. When you go online and buy a supplement – let’s say, copper – it’s a dietary supplement bottle and it’s some form of copper. Please understand that the daily intake of copper recommended for those in America, I believe, is only four milligrams. If it’s a pill or a capsule or a tablet, it’s probably like 99% filler. The amount of copper in there is minuscule. Often, they’re just selling you magnesium stearate or maltodextrin, or whatever is being used to create the rest of the capsule. The amount of copper in the pill is very tiny. Don’t overpay on these things. You can purchase bulk forms of copper that are adequate for human consumption. You can stockpile those. You don’t need to stockpile a bunch of maltodextrin in a bunch of bottles on the wall. They’ll take up a hundred times more space than they need to, just keep that in mind. We’ve talked about silver quite a bit here in this program. But a couple of additional thoughts I want to mention when you have silver coins and silver: Silver is a great bargain. It’s going to go up in price compared to dollars quite substantially in the near future. If you have US mint silver coins, remember that you can use those to make colloidal silver. You can also use those as money to spend with someone via barter. Have some silver coins and you give me a bag of wheat or whatever. It’s real money. Silver coin is money. Silver has so many uses that it’s one of the most valuable things to stockpile. Remember that in the form of silver coins, that’s 99.9% silver. I’ve run the ICP-MS analysis on colloidal silver made from silver coins and found that the other 0.1% is mostly magnesium, nickel and a small amount of aluminum – very low levels of other things. I’m talking about parts per billion that are not really a big problem when you’re talking about emergency medicine. You can make colloidal silver out of silver coins. It’s still almost all silver, which means you can stockpile silver and take advantage of its multiple uses. Silver can be used to make a topical antibacterial spray. One of the best things you can do is take colloidal silver and combine it with either lemon oil, which works the best, or orange oil that contains d-limonene. If you have some kind of surfactant, which is something that mixes oils with water, put that surfactant in there and you’ve created a powerful topical antibacterial spray that can be used to sanitize surfaces, even your own hands. In order to make these things, you need silver. This is also why it’s a great idea to grow kumquats or oranges or lemons or limes in the area where you live because you are making oils. Your plants are making oils that you could squeeze out of their fruit peels. Get these oils that you can combine with colloidal silver to make powerful antibacterial solutions. Remember that in a collapse scenario, it’s going to come down to you being able to make a lot of your own solutions and medicine. Since you can’t make silver – no one can make it except exploding stars and God – you have to stockpile the silver, whereas you can make oranges, lemons and limes because you can grow those. Mother Nature is doing the synthesis for you. That’s what’s so cool about sprouting. The sprouts are making the vitamins. You don’t need to stockpile the vitamins if you stockpile sprouting seeds because they will do the work for you. Mother Nature is doing it for you. You can’t make silver, so you must stockpile. Fortunately, silver is really not that expensive. You can make probably thousands of gallons of colloidal silver out of it. Just two silver coins, which right now only costs maybe $30 a coin. For 60 bucks and some electricity, you can make thousands of gallons of colloidal silver at home. I’ve posted videos on how to do this. I’ve posted videos on how to make your own ionic silver nanoparticle medicine using rosemary herbs as well as ionic silver. You can see that video at PrepWithMike. com . It’s a very, very powerful video. NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 91"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"We’ve even done the electron microscopy to show you what it looks like. We’re making rosmarinic acid nanoparticles that are surrounding an ionic silver elemental payload so that when the rosmarinic acid from rosemary is taken in by the cells in your body, it delivers a payload of ionic silver. It’s well-known that bacteria are highly vulnerable to silver. You can kill bacteria inside your body, theoretically. We do need to have more clinical trials on this to be sure of how effective it is. In theory, this kills bacteria inside your body using nothing but a food spice and ionic silver, and you can make it yourself. Guess what you need in your distilled water to start making colloidal silver? You need a small amount of baking soda to start the conductivity of the water, so that the electrical current that you’re pushing through the two silver coins – one positive, one negative – can start creating ionic silver. You need a tiny amount of baking soda. Not even a pinch – it’s like a partial pinch. I’ve got videos on this on Brighteon.com and also PrepWithMike. com , if you want to check those out. It shows you how to do this. Do you see why you should stockpile silver? You should also stockpile baking soda and salt. You should have a way to make distilled water, which you can achieve just with rainwater collection, which we’ve talked about here. You can do this just with rainwater. You should have bulk soap, have some bulk zinc sulfate, and things like that. You can make a lot of interesting things. That brings me to the subject of ocean water concentrates. In the marketplace, there are companies that sell ocean water that’s been partially dehydrated. This creates kind of a slurry that can be used as a treatment for agriculture. Ocean water, if you really look at the composition of it, is mostly sodium chloride. After sodium chloride, it’s mostly magnesium. When they say, “Oh, there’s a hundred elements in ocean water,” most of those elements are present at concentrations that are so minuscule, they’re almost irrelevant. They’re very, very tiny. If you try to harvest copper out of ocean water, you won’t get much copper. If you try to harvest gold out of ocean water, you won’t get enough gold to even make it worth the harvesting effort. Otherwise, everybody would be mining the ocean for gold. The people have done the math on this and it doesn’t work. It’s not worth it. Ocean water is mostly salt and magnesium. If you think that you need a bunch of salt and magnesium, then go ahead and buy ocean water concentrates. In my experience, I’ve found that they’re really overpriced for delivering salt and magnesium. You can buy salt dirt cheap, and you can buy magnesium. You can get bulk sources of magnesium, like magnesium malate, or even super cheap magnesium oxide – not that I’m recommending that form. But there are other forms, like magnesium glycinate and so on, that would be great to stockpile in bulk and that I think would be much more effective than just buying ocean water concentrate. The other problem with ocean water today is that it’s full of microplastics. That’s because the oceans are heavily polluted by humans, mostly the Chinese. I’m talking about the country of China. The communists, they just dump all their trash into the ocean. Much the same thing is true of India. Also, if you’ve ever been to South America, you may have seen lots of trash all over the place. Drive down the highways in Panama and it’s like a trash alley. It’s like, “Wow, doesn’t anybody in this country believe in cleaning up the highways?” Nope. They don’t. And I know, I’ve lived in South America. People trash their own cities. In Honduras and Peru, there’s trash everywhere, trash in the ocean. I would not want to eat more plastic, which is why I don’t recommend ocean water concentrates as any kind of a treatment for agriculture. They also tend to be overpriced. NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 92"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"I do recommend the idea of stocking up on magnesium. I think that’s a great idea. It’s got a multitude of uses in personal health, as well as agriculture, which brings me to the next point here, which is feeding elements to your sprouts. Remember how we’ve talked about sprouting here throughout this report. I’m big on sprouting. I love sprouting. I do it every day. Just today, I was eating a salad of sprouts with just Caesar salad dressing on it. It was an organic dressing. I made the mistake actually of choosing a variety of sprouts, in this case, that had way too much in the way of radish sprouts and broccoli sprouts, so it was kind of wicked. I was chewing on this going, “Whoa, I should have really increased the alfalfa content of this,” because alfalfa sprouts are just really pleasant and more neutral-tasting. If you start chewing on radish sprouts and broccoli sprouts – even though they have all these anti- cancer, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective medicines, all that stuff – they’re still pretty wicked. Even with the dressing on them, I’m like, “Oh man, how am I going to power through this?” Lucky for me, I had a jar of freshly squeezed juice that’s got like apple juice, peppermint, pineapple and coconut water. I was chewing on the sprouts, and then I was chugging the apple and pineapple juice – which was awesome – so I made it through. I think next time, we’re going to grow more alfalfa sprouts in that mixture. I’m one of those people who don’t think that being healthy should be painful. I think it should be rather pleasant, which is why my superfood smoothies are always really delicious. I’ve been drinking them for 20 years now. Avocados, bananas, coconut water, flax seeds, organic whey protein and some turmeric powder, just a variety of things. It’s all super delicious, and it’s a very enjoyable experience. It’s very rare that I actually eat something that’s not enjoyable, which is why these wicked sprouts kind of got to me today. You’re not going to find me hanging out somewhere drinking wheatgrass shots just because it’s good for me. No, thank you. I’m not interested in going through that. When you’re growing sprouts, this is your opportunity to feed your elements to the sprouts. Normally when you sprout, you’re just using water, and that’s perfectly fine. Then the plant uses all the elements from inside its own seed, and that’s what it’s using to make the sprouts. It’s synthesizing vitamins and all kinds of nutrients that you need. Did you know that you could kill your sprouts with too much zinc? But if you put a little bit of minerals like magnesium and zinc in the water that you’re using to hydrate your sprouts, then those sprouts are going to take up those minerals. Those minerals could include selenium as well. If you’re buying minerals in bulk, make sure you buy them in a form that is water-soluble so you can mix them in with the water. Use just a little bit and feed them to your sprouts as you’re rinsing them. For that last rinse, put some of your mineral water in there. Then what you’re growing are sprouts that are mineral supplements. You now have living minerals. This is really critical to understand because when minerals are taken up by your sprouts, they are transformed into a more organic and more bioavailable form, a plant-based mineral form. A lot of basic minerals that you might have, like magnesium oxide, iron oxide or calcium carbonate – simple sort of non-bioavailable minerals like that – if you feed them to plants, the plants will take them and convert them into plant formats that are more bioavailable to you. It turns out that plants love calcium and magnesium. In fact, if you know anything about hydroponics or growing food, two of the biggest minerals that they need are calcium and magnesium. Of course, they need potassium fertilizer, but I’m talking about nutritive minerals that you probably are lacking. HealthRangerStore.com/SurvivalMagnesium NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 93"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Most people aren’t necessarily lacking in potassium – I guess it’s possible in a collapse – but think about if you need more calcium in your body, why would you take calcium carbonate, which is just ground-up oyster shells, when you could be eating sprouted calcium, so to speak? That’s not really the right term, but think of it – it’s calcium that is transformed by sprouts into another form of calcium that is available for your body to digest in plant form. That is smart. If you want your minerals to go a long way, understand that in their basic raw forms, like calcium carbonate, probably 90% of that is wasted by your body if you’re just drinking calcium carbonate. And actually, it’s contributing to kidney stones, too, and calcification of your arteries. Which is why all those people that go out there and buy all these almond milks and oat milks and everything that’s in the grocery store – guess what they use to turn those milks kind of white-looking? Oh, calcium carbonate and carrageenan. It’s all just ground-up oyster shells with carrageenan thickener and a little bit of almond flavoring or something. It’s fake. It’s not even really a hundred percent almond milk. If you keep drinking that stuff, you’re going to get calcium carbonate buildup in your body. You can have calcifications, and you may start to have joint pain, bone pain and kidney problems because of that, because you’ve been drinking calcium carbonate, which is stupid. You don’t go into a cave with a hammer, break off a chunk of limestone and take it home, throw it in your blender, add water and then drink that. That would be insane. You’re drinking rock powder, rock dust. That’s what’s in the almond milk in the grocery stores. That’s not good for you. You’re not supposed to drink that. In a collapse scenario, it’s not going to help you. Through the magic of sprouting and combining the minerals with the water that you’re using to irrigate your sprouts, you can let the sprouts turn those minerals into real food, real minerals, bioavailable minerals. Sometimes they’re called organic minerals or organic forms, from a chemistry point of view. Now your body can take them in. I don’t happen to know exactly which form calcium goes into when a sprout takes it up. I don’t know if it becomes like a calcium orotate or something, but that’d be some interesting chemistry to check out. Nevertheless, it is now transformed into a plant-based form. When you consume it, you can get all the benefits. Think about all the minerals that are important for human health. There are lots of them. The trace minerals, we’ve mentioned most of them: copper, zinc, selenium and manganese. Then there are the macro minerals like calcium, magnesium, potassium and so on. Think about what’s necessary for human health and look into stockpiling the really low-cost bulk forms of many of these minerals, knowing that you can then transform them into plant-based minerals through the magic of sprouting at any future date. This is awesome because you can store these bulk minerals usually in a dry format. They will last essentially forever. Calcium never stops being calcium. It doesn’t go bad. It’s not like flax oil, which gets oxidized and goes rancid. Flax oil goes rancid very quickly. It’s kind of famous for that. It goes bad quickly, but calcium never goes bad and never stops being calcium. Silver never stops being silver. Zinc never stops being zinc. Baking soda never stops being baking soda. That stuff stores forever. You talk about investing in preparedness supplies. These are investments in your health, in your cleanliness. These are investments in elements that can be used for food preservation, processing of meat with the salt, and so on. This investment will never go away. You are essentially purchasing the table of elements. HealthRangerStore.com/SurvivalSaltSlab NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 94"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"If you think about the table of elements from hydrogen and helium all the way through the whole thing, the table of elements is immutable in most cases, except for nuclear fusion or fusion processes, exploding stars and nuclear bombs. In normal day-to- day life, elements are immutable. If you’re buying elements, you are investing in the physical reality that you need in order to live. Some of these elements are minerals that you need nutritively. Some of these elements could be used to make antibacterial medicines. Some of these elements can be used to preserve meat. Some elements can be used to enhance your recipes, whereas when you buy molecules such as vitamin C, vitamin C can cease being vitamin C over time. It may lose some of its potency. Why? Because vitamin C is made of elements like hydrogen, carbon and oxygen. It has to exist in a certain structure in order to be ascorbic acid, which is vitamin C. Over time, especially when subjected to variations in heat or humidity, vitamin C can stop being vitamin C. It’ll break down into other simpler molecules and then eventually, into just simple elements or matrix, depending on what we’re talking about. Complex molecules can be broken down, but elements will never break down unless the Earth gets consumed by the Sun or something. In which case, the elements are the least of your problems. A good way to think about all of this is that plants, which are herbs as well as food crops and sprouts, are creating molecules, but they’re using elements to do it. They’re using elements like hydrogen, carbon and oxygen, all of which are taken from the air and from their roots via water. They use those three simple elements to synthesize all kinds of things. Plants also take other elements, such as sulfur, copper or magnesium, to make compounds like chlorophyll. Chlorophyll is made with magnesium in the middle. Yes, magnesium is needed to make this complex molecule that’s used to carry energy throughout the plant. Chlorophyll’s kind of like the blood of plants. It’s made with magnesium, whereas in the human body, it’s more hemoglobin, which is based on iron. The thing is, when you think about what to stockpile for survival, elements cannot be created, so you have to stockpile those. Plants will grow the molecules that you need for medicine, which is why you should grow oregano, cilantro and basil. You should grow all these herbs because they’re making the molecules. But because those molecules are more delicate, they’ll break down over time. Elements will never break down. It’s very important to understand the difference here. This is basic chemistry. What’s the difference between a molecule and an element? An element is from the table of elements. It’s an atom that, by itself, is immutable. But a molecule is a combination of atoms. Molecules are like a Lego set that you’ve assembled using oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen, sulfur and magnesium. Most of everything in our carbon- based world is made with carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. If you look at your entire body and the atomic weight of the atoms that are used throughout your body, you’ll find your body’s 75% water. Water is hydrogen and oxygen. What’s the atomic weight of the oxygen in your body? Let’s say maybe it’s 30%. You might be 30% oxygen; it’s something like that. A lot of your body is hydrogen, even though hydrogen is very, very tiny in terms of molecular weight. The number of hydrogen atoms in your body is enormous. But hydrogen’s so tiny it doesn’t weigh very much. It’s got almost no mass. How much of your body is carbon? A lot of your body is carbon. This is why when human bodies are cremated, they turn to ash. Just like when you burn a log on a fire, it turns to ash. What’s ash? It’s the minerals. You burn a human body, it turns to ash, and that ash contains the minerals that was in the body, plus a certain amount of carbon. The oxygen is gone. It’s already been emitted into the air through the combustion process. But other elements are there. This is the cycle of life, and the cycle of composition with plants and humans and all of us. NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 95"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"The reason I mentioned this is because it’s really crucial to understand that minerals cannot be created or destroyed, but molecules can. And plants will make the molecules for you for free. This is why some level of agriculture is necessary to really practice Survival Nutrition, because you’ve got to grow some of these to keep them fresh and to keep the supply going. That can be as simple as sprouting, as we’ve talked about, or it can be growing herbs on a window sill. It doesn’t have to be complex. You don’t have to have a big John Deere tractor or 50 acres. You don’t have to grow wheat or corn. You don’t have to do that in order to benefit from this. You could have a small pot with a kumquat tree and that tree could provide you with vitamin C and essentially orange-peel oils, because that’s what kumquat trees do automatically. This is what they are built to do. This is what their purpose is in this world. Living in harmony with plants and these cycles of minerals and molecules and water and the respiration and how plants harvest molecules from the air and then emit other molecules, such as O2. Understanding how plants harvest molecules from the air and then emit other molecules, such as O2, gives you a major advantage in the Survival Nutrition game, because now you understand where things come from and how the pieces fit together. If you think about this, most individuals don’t have the knowledge that you now have from listening to this course. Most individuals don’t understand the difference between atoms and molecules. They don’t understand where vitamin C comes from. They don’t understand that plants are creating medicine. They don’t understand that you can feed minerals to plants and have those plants transform them into bioavailable medicines. They don’t understand why you would want to engage in sprouting. Most people, all they think is food comes from Taco Bell and that’s it. Those people will die in the collapse because they have no clue about agriculture and food sources and how minerals are recycled through the whole system.

The collapse is seemingly nearly here – societal collapse, economic collapse, we’ve talked about all these things before. I think those who survive are going to be those who are able to be more self- reliant, which is really the main thing I’ve talked about here. We know that we are facing a global scale mass starvation. We know that food banks across America are already sounding the alarm that they’re billions of pounds short of food for the projected future. We know that record numbers of Americans are lining up at food banks. In some cases, tens of thousands in certain cities drive up in their cars wanting supplemental food because they can’t afford the food. Isn’t it interesting – just as a side note – that no one tells these people about sprouting? When they go to the food bank, what do they get? Processed garbage food. They get instant macaroni and cheese, noodles, a bag of rice and starches. They don’t get anything that’s nutrient-rich or mineral- rich. They’re getting supplemental emergency food, but they’re still nutrient-deficient. If we really wanted to feed America, we would teach America about sprouting. We would teach America about mineral deficiencies or about simple ways to grow some of your own food, grow some of your own herbs. We would teach people about the definition of food so that it has minerals and phytonutrients and calories -- all three – not just one, which is calories. Most people are just eating calories. It’s not even real food. They’re missing out on the minerals. They’re missing out on the phytonutrients. They’re just getting empty calories. No wonder that we are a nation of people who tend to be overweight but undernourished. How can we be obese but suffering from nutritional deficiencies? Because the food is a hollow shadow of what it’s supposed to be. The food isn’t really food. We’re not teaching America that. We’re not even teaching about food decentralization, i.e., growing a garden in your own backyard. Grow food locally. Grow it in your front yard or in your city park. Do micro gardening, guerilla gardening, sprouting, container gardening, square foot gardening – whatever you want to call it. Grow some food. Americans don’t do that. They eat processed food then they die from deficiencies after getting diagnosed with cancer, diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer’s, and so on because they’re often lacking in minerals. They’re lacking nutrition. I’ve just handed you the best overall solution to all of this, to show you that there is a way to beat all this. There is a way to be physically fit, to have good nourishment and to prevent chronic degenerative conditions even in a collapse scenario. There is a way to do that; it just requires a little bit of knowledge, like what I’ve shared here, and a little bit of action on your part. It doesn’t even require a ton of money. Not that much money, but action. If I were to invite you to my home right now, you’d be shocked because you would see that I have all these desks on wheels. The way I operate is: I have a giant room. And then I have these mobile worktables, and on each worktable is a project. Then I roll them to the side or roll them into focus when I’m working on them.

But it’s highly unusual for most Americans. Do you know what you won’t find anywhere in my workshop area? There’s no TV, no cable, no Netflix. There’s no social gathering party room, no pool table. It’s about research and development and learning. I’ve got a table set up with a camera over it for all my videos to do PrepWithMike.com videos as well. I’ve got some heavy-duty cord over there. It’s like a super paracord. I’m going to do a video on that coming up. I’ve got a bunch of swords over there. I was going to do a video about survival katanas, machetes and blades for survival use, and so on. If I were to show you where I live and what I do, it’s like a giant workshop. It’s kind of like a science museum – maybe a survival and science museum – but with active projects everywhere. I do admit it’s a lot messier than a science museum. It’s more cluttered because there’s a lot of stuff going on. On any given day, I might move over from one project to another, roll this other bench in and start working on that, depending on what the priority is. I’m doing these things as I’m sharing with you. This is not an academic project for me. I’m not giving you this information as some kind of professor who wrote a book but never had his hands in the ground. I’m sharing information with you that I live every day. This is what I do, which is why – as you can tell – my knowledge on these subjects is very in-depth, because I’ve done all these things. Many of these things, I’ve developed techniques for, such as the nanoparticles with the ionic silver, and so on. I’ve developed the techniques, and I share those with you. And there’s no other source in the world where you will get that information from because nobody else is doing this. I’m on my feet most of the day, and that’s in addition to the biking, the jogging and the firearms workouts, the night vision tactical training after dark, and whatever else I’m doing, I’m on my feet almost all day. I’m in my fifties, but I’m as active and as healthy as ever. It’s because of these things I’ve just shared with you. That’s why I’m able to maintain this level of cognitive function and physical function. I can’t run as fast as I used to 20 years ago, and maybe I can’t fight in Krav Maga as well as I used to 20 years ago. I probably can’t carry as heavy a pack, but I’m certainly very functional and can still do everything that I need to do. I’m still living on a farm, carrying around bags of grain, repairing the tractors and doing farm types of activities because of nutrition. It really is about what you feed your body.

Here, you and I are talking about survival in a collapse scenario, which is the whole context for this audiobook. Yet, isn’t it fascinating that day to day in our lives and all around us are people who can’t even survive in good times because they don’t know about nutrition? Think about that. The name of this course is Survival Nutrition, and it implies that we’re talking about nutrition during a collapse – but really, it’s also about surviving with nutrition even during good times because most people are dying from their food. They’re dying from mineral deficiencies. They’re dying from a lack of phytonutrients. They’re dying from the toxic food chemicals that they’re consuming in their processed food meals. People are dying even when there’s not a collapse. People are dying every day. They’re committing almost food suicide. When they go out and eat a McDonald’s and have french fries or whatever, they’re killing themselves. And ask yourself this question: If they’re killing themselves during good times, how are they going to fare during a collapse? They can’t survive now. They will not be able to survive when it hits the fan. They will be in an even worse situation. Help those that you can. I always believe in helping people with knowledge as well. You know what they say: “You give a man fish; you’ve helped him for a day. You teach a man how to fish; you’ve helped him for a lifetime.” That’s what I’m into, teaching people how to think about food, nutrients, plants, minerals, longevity and disease prevention – all these things, and how all of that works. With knowledge, you can live every day. You can prosper. You can prevent degenerative diseases. You can make it through a crisis. You can grow your own vitamins. You can make your own antibacterial medicine treatments in a pinch in an emergency if you have to. This is knowledge. This is precious and life- saving. Treasure things like knowledge that can help you get through what’s coming. That is the reason why I do this. Thank you for listening. I’m Mike Adams, the Health Ranger. Visit SurvivalNutrition.com .

This is about food microcaching, or how to hide your food in your own home or outside your home. If you haven’t already, be sure to download the full free audiobook of Survival Nutrition. It’s found at SurvivalNutrition.com . And I’m Mike Adams, the author. Let’s start with the question: Why would you need to hide your food in your own home? A lot of people don’t know it, but in 2012, President Obama signed the national defense authorization act and other executive orders that, in combination, allow FEMA to confiscate all the food in your home under a national emergency. These rules apply to farms as well as individual households. They allow the federal government to seize not only seeds, cattle, diesel fuel and tractor equipment, but also groceries and food, including stored food. There are a lot of people in society today who believe that those who store food are bad people and call them hoarders. Even though all you really did was you just bought a little bit of extra food every time you went to the grocery store. You didn’t steal it; you paid for it, fair and square. You didn’t hoard it. Other people could buy food, too. You didn’t empty the shelves, you just accumulated a little bit more food over time, and you stored it in a way that let you end up with a large stockpile of extra food, which is a smart thing to do. The federal government does it. The federal government has caves full of stored food, ammunition, medical supplies, and so on. Having backup supplies is a very wise thing, but there’s an element of society that says it’s bad. When things hit the fan, those people will tend to say that you’re bad for having extra food. You’re a hoarder. After they say that, that’s when they’ll want to come and take it for themselves. This is how they justify it. They’re not thieves, you’re a hoarder and they’re just liberating the stuff that you hoarded; they’re just distributing the food fairly. They’ll say, “Oh, it’s fair to have food distribution,” just like they currently claim it’s fair to have wealth redistribution. Tax the producers of society, take their money and hand it out to people who don’t produce. These are the same people who will come for your food. You’ll need to be able to hide your food so that you don’t appear to be a “hoarder,” especially when all you’ve done is just take some commonsense measures to have a backup supply in anticipation of supply line disruptions, which are already happening. So, how do you hide your food? Don’t just try to hide it in an extra room in your house; that’s going to be easily discovered. If you have the food under the bed in the guest bedroom, that’s not NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 100"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"a very good, effective hiding place. It’s going to be found very easily. Yes, FEMA can enter your home without a warrant looking for extra food merely because one of your neighbors called FEMA and said they observed you having extra food. This reminds me: Don’t get large shipments of obvious stored food products to your home. Do a little bit over time. Don’t have UPS show up with 57 cases of dried green beans or whatever where your neighbors can see and hear the UPS guy say, “Oh my goodness, look at all this food.” You’re making a big scene. Do a little bit each day over time to build it up slowly, so you don’t raise eyebrows. Don’t store food in your attic. You might think it’s a good hiding place, but it isn’t, because it gets hot and cold and hot and cold. This destroys the shelf life of food. In fact, it’s those temperature cycles that actually destroy food more than just sitting at a high temperature for a long, sustained period of time. It’s much better to have a stable temperature, and you’d want to keep food cool if you want it to have a long shelf life. Some people are buying food that they think has a 20-year shelf life because that’s what the advertisers and marketers promote, but that is false usually. They’re going to be shocked to discover that it’s nowhere near that because they didn’t refrigerate it. You need to keep it in a dry, cool dark place. A dry basement is often a good idea. For hiding it, you need to start thinking about how your house was constructed. Where do you have empty spaces in your house? We can start with the walls. Usually, you’ve got sheet rock over 2x4’s on 16-inch centers, which means you’ve got maybe a 14-inch gap that is 3.5 inches deep or so with maybe insulation in it. You’ve got drywall over that. What you can do is – and I know this sounds like a lot of work, but drywall is not that difficult – you can take out a big section of drywall and pack long-term storable foods inside that wall. Then you can patch it back up with a drywall patch or repair kit, which you can get at Home Depot, so it looks just like brand new. Unless someone’s going to go around your entire house tearing down all the drywall – which normally they don’t do – they’re not going to find your stored foods. You’d want to have a very high density of stored foods in the walls, and you don’t want anything that mice can get into because they will find it and they’ll eat it. You’ll just be basically building a mouse nest, which will smell like urine and mouse poo in no time. That’s not a good thing to have in your walls. You want to have things that are very durable and completely rodent-proof; for example, coconut oil inside a glass jar or a metal jar of some kind. Mice can eat through thin plastic. I’ve even seen mice eat through those plastic lids that are typically used on #10 cans. They’ll eat right through those. Mice typically won’t eat through a plastic pail or a five-gallon bucket. That’s something they normally can’t get through; then again, you can’t fit a five-gallon bucket in your walls. You’ll need to find containers that will fit in your walls, containers that are mouse proof and ant proof and everything else. You’ll want to store things that have a long, long shelf life without requiring refrigeration. What are those things? It turns out, those are things like whole grains, such as whole wheat berries, which are dried and vacuum-packed. You can protect those by putting them in some kind of a container that’s mouse-proof. This advice goes for food that you’re storing anywhere that you’re storing it, be it whole grain NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 101"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"oats, quinoa, whole grain rice, and so on. Take the whole grains, kamut, barley, red lentils, green lentils, kidney beans and black beans – all these things have a very long shelf life, even if they’re not refrigerated. If your house is air-conditioned, that’s probably good enough. You can store those all over your house in packs. And don’t forget salt. A little bit of salt goes a long way. It doesn’t take up much storage space, and salt stores forever, as long as you keep it dry. Salt attracts water, so if you put salt in the walls without proper packaging, it’ll just suck water into itself, and then it’ll drip down salty water below wherever you have it, which will create problems like wood rot in your walls. Be careful about storing salt. There are special precautions for that. In addition to your walls, you may also be able to store things in appliances, such as the inside of the door of your refrigerator, or perhaps your oven, or maybe a secret compartment underneath your kitchen sink. Or, if you take the panel off your washing machine or dryer or something like that, you’ll find a lot of empty spaces. It turns out that people who are drug dealers or drug traffickers, they know all about hiding things. If you have friends who are drug traffickers, you might check with them and find out where they hide stuff. Tell them it’s for food. They may not believe you; they may ask if you’re wearing a wire, but they actually know these things. They’re very good at hiding things in cars – drug smugglers and so on. You can see videos online of where to hide things in your own house. I think a lot of those videos are for people who traffic drugs, but you don’t have to use it for that purpose. You could be hiding freeze-dried coffee or whatever’s valuable to you. Just use it for your purposes. You’ll find that people who hide things in cars just hide drugs inside the seats or inside the panels of the doors, places like that. Think about the geometry of your house. You might even be able to put a false floor in the bottom of a desk drawer. I’ve seen people hide food and other things inside the cover of computers, like a computer on your desk. You know how it’s got a computer cover; you open it up, look inside, and you’ve got your RAM chips and your CPU and everything. Sometimes, people could put things in there. It’s going to interfere with the cooling flow of the air moving through that chassis. It might cause problems. Maybe you have a computer that you’re not using. You can open it up, and you can stuff a bunch of food in there and hide it from the authorities who are trying to take it from you. Government theft. Some of the best places to hide things are in the floor. If you’ve got floorboards and you can put something under the floorboards, that can be very effective. Some people go so far as to have a secret concrete storage place under the floor. You’ve seen this probably in movies as well. You have to open it up with a sledgehammer. You have to break the concrete to get your stuff out. That’s a lot of work; but guess what? It’s highly secured. Nobody is going to go around your house, much less FEMA. They’re not going to go sledgehammering your entire house just to see if you’ve got some extra peanut butter stored away and whatever you have there. You might want to store some gold bars, guns and ammo while you’re at it; don’t make it just peanut butter. If you’ve got a storage place that’s high security, you might as well use it for all it’s worth. HealthRangerStore.com/SurvivalBeePollen NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 102"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Think about the geometry of your house. Think about all the empty spaces in the furniture, in the walls, in the appliances and in your mattress. I know it’s almost a cliché. People say, “Oh, you’re hiding cash under your mattress.” You know why that’s a cliché? Because people did that before. They put money under their mattresses. Why did they do that? Because that was the safest place they could think of. The money was out of sight, and they were sleeping on it. You couldn’t be robbed at night without waking up, so they put it under their mattresses. A lot of Mormons store food under the bed. That’s not really well hidden, but it is making use of storage space. Let’s talk about outside food storage because this is where your possibilities really open up. If you want to store food outside, it’s got to be underground. Immediately, this brings up issues of moisture, whereas rodents are your problem when you’re storing food in your house. Moisture is usually the problem outside. Whatever you store it in, it’s going to get rained on at some point. The ground is going to be inundated with water. If you don’t have a watertight container – and I mean, really, really watertight – that can also be buried and withstand the sidewall pressures of soil, then you’re going to lose whatever you bury. There are people who buy PVC tubes, like a 6-inch PVC, and stuff it full of guns, ammunition and maybe some food and some first aid supplies. It’s like a little survival cache. Then they’ll put PVC glue on the lid and seal it up. That’s the low-budget way to do it. It works fine. You can bury that sucker. But the problem is, you’ve got to break it to open it back up. If you want to add to it later on, there’s no good way to do that. In the past, I have purchased some storage pods that were supposed to be underground pods with a gasket and a screw-on lid that looked really rugged. When I went back a year later, water was inside. They failed. The downside of something that got a screw- on lid is that a lot of times, those lids really aren’t watertight. They don’t live up to the promises of the manufacturers, and you end up with water in your stored food. Or, in my case, I was storing ammunition in that container. It was a test trying to see if those things are any good, and I found out they’re not. When you get into real redneck country, what rednecks like to do is they take an old refrigerator and bury it. They fill it with food, guns and ammo, and then they close the door, seal it up and bury it. The refrigerator is actually not a bad container for that, but I think there’s something better. It’s the polyethylene drums that are watertight. What I’ve found that you can do is, you can buy those large ammo can-looking type of things – but they’ve actually contained mortar shells and stand about 28 inches, maybe 30 inches, tall. They just look like really tall ammo cans. These seal up really well; they’ve got durable rubber gaskets. They’re made for the military, and they were storing artillery shells. You take two or three of those and put your food, guns, ammo, gold – whatever you want – in there. But because they are subject to rust, put them inside a 55-gallon polyethylene drum. The drum has a lid that gets sealed on with a big metal clamp. Now you’ve got a 55-gallon drum, and inside the drum, you’ve got the former artillery shell ammo cans, which are watertight, airtight and filled with your stuff. You can take those drums, and you can either bury those or put them somewhere where people won’t find them. You can half bury them. I’ve seen people do that, too. You can bury it halfway, with half of it sticking up out of the ground, and then you throw camo netting or something on top of that out in a forest somewhere. NaturalNews.com Survival Nutrition Guide 103"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Most people won’t find it, and it won’t be crushed by the weight of the soil. Also, no one’s likely to step on it because it’s sticking partway out of the ground. You can also find it when you want to, in case you forgot where you buried everything. There are a lot of different approaches to this. All of these are valuable approaches, something to think about. Should you do this? Should you bury food? It’s not a bad idea to think about this. If you bury food, you should bury it with something like a water filter. You should bury it with a little camp stove, utensils or a set of pots and pans for camping, so that you can do more than just have raw wheat berries. You need to be able to cook something. You need to be able to serve up a meal from this. That’s how you get that done. My final piece of advice in all of this is to have a cache of expired food that you’re willing to give up to the authorities. This is a good reason to keep expired food around in case they come to your house wanting to seize food. It’s always good to be able to give them something to make them go away. I’ve had the same advice when it comes to firearms confiscation. It’s good to have an old, broken shotgun that doesn’t work or something so you can say, “Yeah, I’m complying, here’s my shotgun.” They’re not going to check everything out and make sure it works. You could probably hand them an AR-15 without a bolt in it. They wouldn’t know. Just give them a bunch of expired food so they can claim to their commander to have achieved success. “Yes, we’ve confiscated food. Look at what we got. All these boxes of crackers.” They’re not going to look at the date and find out the food had expired in 2007. They’re not that bright. They’re the food confiscation team people working for FEMA. They’re probably going to get shot by somebody. They’re not too bright. You don’t have to really outsmart them that much. Have a supply of expired, garbage crap to give away. The bulkier it looks, the better. Just take up all the space in their vehicle. That’s my advice, and that’s a valid strategy for dealing with food confiscation. Thank you for listening.
