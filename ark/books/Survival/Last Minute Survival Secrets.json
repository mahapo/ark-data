You fall off a cruise ship in the middle of the ocean, or the ship unexpectedly smashes into an errant iceberg, gets hit by a tsunami and flips upside down, or capsizes after the drunken captain steers too close to shore and collides into underwater rocks. Unfortunately, you don’t have a life vest. How do you make one while treading water? While visiting Tahrir Square in Cairo, reoccupying Wall Street, or en- countering the inevitable Martian invasion, you get a face full of tear gas, pepper spray, or heinous Martian vapor. Too bad you forgot your gas mask. What can you do besides cough and wheeze? A massive hurricane knocks out the electricity for miles in every di- rection, making your electric stove and microwave oven useless. The tor - rential rain drenches all your firewood, and silly you forgot to fill the propane tank for the barbecue grill. How do you cook up some macaroni and cheese? Fortunately, you can easily overcome any dire situation—during a natural disaster, terrorist attack, hostage crisis, or catastrophic emer - gency—by putting simple household items to use in unexpected ways. Yes, hundreds of quirky yet ingenious survival techniques are hidden in everyday household items. In this book, you’ll discover an abundance of handy and unusual secrets to outsmart the unexpected, escape perilous situations, and circumvent life-threatening dilemmas. You’ll learn how to think like a resourceful, problem-solving survivalist, triumphing over complex emergency situations on the spot with everyday materials, instead of relying on months of preparation and expensive equipment. Should all hell break loose in the wake of a major disaster or calamity, you’ll in- stinctively know how to make a radio antenna with a Slinky, revive a dead car battery with aspirin, and start a fire with potato chips.

You’ll find step-by- step instructions on how to use everyday products to construct the tools needed to escape harrowing situations and survive unforeseen ca taclysms—using ingenuity to transform common objects into rescue devices. You’ll learn how to make a life vest with condoms, build a solar- powered cooker with aluminum foil, start a fire with steel wool and a battery, hide valuables in a tennis ball, fashion a sling with panty hose, and build an emergency lantern with baby oil and a tampon. How did I discover all these offbeat survival secrets? Growing up in Florida, I lived through several hurricanes, stood in the eye of the storm, and experienced days without electricity. While backpacking around the world on our honeymoon, my wife and I fled the military occupation of La Paz, Bolivia. Shortly after we moved to Los Angeles, the 1994 North- ridge earthquake ravaged our apartment. While visiting New York City on September 11, 2001, we witnessed the terrorist attack on the World Trade Towers and wound up stranded in the city for a week. To survive, I’ve broken into my own locked suitcase with a ballpoint pen, filtered and purified puddle water with a bandana and iodine, treated dehydra- tion with a disposable diaper, cooked food with a clothes iron, carried an emergency kit inside an Altoids tin, disinfected a wound with Lister - ine mouthwash, and splinted a broken leg with a pizza box and Bubble Wrap. You can too. All you need is the gumption to live by your wits. And perhaps a paper clip and a pair of panty hose. By the way, if you ever find yourself in the midst of a third-world revolution or postapocalyptic hellhole, return to your hotel room, fill the bathtub with water, and then go to the hotel bar and buy all the bottles of liquor. The filled bathtub becomes your emergency water supply, and you can use the alcohol as an anesthetic, an antiseptic, fuel to start a fire, or—should the economy completely collapse—the new currency. Cheers!"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"1 1 g adgets and g izmos You can’t get cell phone reception. Your burglar alarm goes on the fritz. You desperately need a helmet. Fortunately, a slew of seemingly innocuous household items—an empty soda can, a bag of potato chips, or a simple mop bucket—can be used to create an extensive arsenal of handy gadgets."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"2 LAST - MINUTE SURVIVAL SECRETS h ow to Make a Life v est from Condoms What You n eed What to Do 1. Unwrap the first condom, unroll it, place your lips against the opening, and inflate as if it were a bal- loon. When the condom reaches roughly 18 inches in diameter, tie a double knot in the free end. 2. Tie one end of a shoelace above the knot of the in- flated condom and knot it securely several times. 3. Repeat with the second condom, fastening one end of the second shoelace to just above the knot. 4. Tie the free ends of the shoelaces together securely. 5. Holding one inflated condom in your left hand, guide the second condom under your left arm, around your back, and under your right arm. Position the inflated condoms at the height of your chest. 6. Enter the water slowly to prevent the inflated condoms from popping, or the dental floss from breaking. (If you can enter the water only by jumping, do not assemble the life vest until you are in the water.) How It Works Once you are in the water with the life vest around your body, the water displacement created by the inflated condoms will keep you afloat. The condoms, made from sturdy latex, are surprisingly rugged and will not pop. Always Wear a Life Vest When Boating The US Coast Guard estimates that life jackets could have saved the lives of more than 80 percent of the people killed in boating accidents. Most boating accidents happen with terrifying speed on the water, giving •\t Two condoms •\t Two shoelaces (or 3-foot length of dental floss)"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"GADGETS AND GI z MOS 3 individuals little time to reach for a stowed life jacket. Life jackets designed to keep your head above water can prevent you from drowning should you be knocked unconscious and overboard during a boating accident. A snug-fitting life vest can also help you survive in cold water, insulating your body and preventing hypothermia. s taying Afloat •\t To make an effective lifesaver (a buoyant device, not the candy), fill a clean, empty bleach jug with an inch of water, secure the cap in place, and tie a rope to the handle. Holding the free end of the rope, toss the jug to the drowning person. The water gives the jug just enough weight so you can toss the jug a significant distance. •\t Improvise a more substantial lifesaver by knotting a piece of rope around the handles of four clean, empty bleach jugs. Secure the caps in place and tie the ends of the rope together to form a loop, which can then fit around a person’s waist. •\t In a dire emergency, you can improvise a float from an ice chest or cooler (sealed shut, with duct tape, if necessary), a plastic trash bag filled with air and knotted (or twist tied) shut, or even a bucket (or large plastic salad bowl) turned upside down and submerged to trap air inside."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"4 LAST - MINUTE SURVIVAL SECRETS Ev E ry t ri C k in th E Book t he Condom Conundrum A condom can save your life—in more ways than one. •\t Cell p hone Case.

Using a pair of scissors, cut the soda bottle diagonally across the bottom so that the bottle, when placed against your face, fits snugly over your nose and mouth. 2. Holding the uncapped bottle upside down, fill the bottle halfway with cotton balls. 3. Saturate the cotton balls with vinegar. 4. Place the bottom of the bottle over your mouth and nose (making sure you have a tight seal against the skin), and breathe through the bottle. 5. For eye protection, wear shatterproof swim goggles (also available with prescription lenses) that provide an excellent seal. To prevent the goggles from fogging up and inhibiting your vision, coat the inside of the lenses with a drop of shaving cream and then buff clean. 6. Never wear contact lenses if you anticipate being exposed to tear gas or pepper spray. 7. Wear long pants, a long-sleeved shirt, and a hat to prevent chemicals from coming in contact with your skin. Bonus Tip: If you want to keep your hands free, use duct tape (folded in half lengthwise) to fashion a strap to hold the soda bottle in place over your nose and mouth. How It Works Vinegar neutralizes and counteracts the effects of tear gas and pepper spray. As early as 77 bc , Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder noted the ben- eficial effects of vinegar on respiratory problems. h ow to d evise a g as Mask with v inegar and a s oda Bottle What You n eed •\t Sc issors •\t 1-liter plastic soda bottle •\t Handful of cotton balls •\t 1 cup of vinegar (apple cider vinegar is less pungent than white vinegar, but both work equally well)"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"6 LAST - MINUTE SURVIVAL SECRETS s imple g as Mask Fo r a more impromptu version, simply soak a bandana in vinegar and keep it in a ziplock storage bag until you need it. To use, hold the vinegar-soaked bandana over your nose and mouth and breathe through it. You can wear a disposable respirator mask underneath the bandana to avoid breathing the vinegar directly. Your Cup Runneth o ver If you desperately need a simple dust mask, take a bra and place a single cup over your nose and mouth, holding it in place to create a tight seal against your face. The various materials blended and tightly knit together to make bras—cotton, foam, Jacquard, latex, mesh, microfiber, nylon, polyester, satin, spandex, Spanette, and tricot—are similar to those used in disposable dust masks sold in hardware stores. Chemical Weapons The two most common chemical weapons used by police are tear gas (chlo- roacetophenone) and pepper spray (capsicum oleoresin). Mace is usually an aerosol form of tear gas or a mixture of tear gas and pepper spray. The best way to protect your eyes and lungs from tear gas is to wear a gas mask with shatterproof lenses, such as US M17 masks. •\t Tear Gas. Tear gas—a chemical irritant—sticks to skin, combines with body oils to create an acidic solution that causes minor burns on the skin, and causes a burning sensation in the eyes, nose, mouth, and lungs. It can cause serious respiratory distress. Tear gas is typically dispersed from a canister to create a fog or mist. •\t Pepper Spray. Pepper spray—a concentrated extract from hot pep- pers—causes an extremely painful burning sensation in the eyes, throat, nose, and skin. If inhaled or ingested, pepper spray can cause respiratory disorder. It is generally sprayed from a small aerosol can or a fogger resembling a fire extinguisher."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"GADGETS AND GI z MOS 7 If You’re e xposed to Tear g as 1. If you are exposed to tear gas or pepper spray, leave the area imme- diately, find fresh air, and breathe. You should feel better right away. 2.

Sit upright until help arrives, taking slow breaths. 3. If you are exposed to tear gas, Mace, or pepper spray in the eyes, remove contact lenses immediately to avoid permanent eye damage. Flush the eyes with water and seek medical attention immediately. 4. Remove contaminated clothes as soon as possible, place them in a plastic bag, seal it closed, and discard it. 5. Shower in cold water (to keep your pores closed) and scrub vigorously with castile soap. Wash your hair with castile soap without allowing chemicals in your hair to get on your face. 6.

Smooth the foil onto the panel. Leave flat to dry. 6. To set up the oven as shown, lay the panel flat with shiny side up. Fold up front and back parts and insert the two end flaps back into the slots in front. 7. Clamp a clothespin onto the underside of each flap, near the slot, to hold them in place. How to Cook Food 1. Place your food in a black cooking pot with a tight-fitting lid. You can use this simple solar-powered oven to cook food, bake breads, and pasteurize water. 2. Place the pot inside a clear, heat-resistant plastic bag (such as an oven bag), and close the open end of the bag. If you don’t have an appropri- ate bag, cover the pot with a clear glass bowl. 3. Place the bag-enclosed pot in the center of the flat part of the solar oven panel. 4. Place the solar-powered cooker in direct sunlight for several hours. For a noontime meal, start cooking the food by 9:00 or 10:00 am. For an evening meal, start cooking the food by 1:00 or 2:00 pm. 5. Use potholders to remove the pot (which will be very hot) from the plastic bag. How It Works When exposed to sunlight, a dark-colored cooking pot converts light energy to heat energy, which starts cooking the food inside the pot. The aluminum foil panels reflect additional sunlight onto the pot, increasing the temperature. The clear plastic bag acts as a heat trap, allowing addi- tional sunlight in while retaining the heat. Cooking food using this solar-powered oven generally takes about twice as long as using a conventional oven. The temperature inside the pot gradually increases, allowing you to leave the food unwatched as it slowly cooks. Once the food is cooked, the oven simply keeps it warm— without burning it. This means you never have to stir the food while it cooks. The oven usually reaches a maximum temperature of 300°F as the food nears completion. The solar-powered cooker will cook food as long as the temperature inside the pot reaches approximately 200°F. The high temperatures"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"10 LAST - MINUTE SURVIVAL SECRETS recommended in cookbooks for conventional ovens simply cook foods faster. Recipes •\t Baking. Depending on the amount of dough, allow 1 to 1.5 hours for breads and biscuits. Allow 1 hour for cookies. •\t Beans. Soak the beans in water overnight, and then cook with water for 2 to 3 hours. •\t Beef, Chicken, or Fish. Place in the pot without any water. For beef, allow between 1.5 and 3 hours (depending on the size). For chicken, allow between 1.5 and 2.5 hours. For fish, allow 1 to 1.5 hours. •\t Cereals and Grains. Add two parts water for every one part rice, wheat, barley, or oats. Let soak for 2 or 3 hours before cooking. Cook for 1 hour, shake the pot to guarantee uniform cooking, and then cook for another 30 minutes to 1 hour. •\t Pasta and Dehydrated Soups. Heat the water for roughly 1 hour to achieve a temperature near boiling. Add the pasta or soup mix, stir well, and then cook for another 15 to 20 minutes. •\t Vegetables. Cut fresh carrots, broccoli, potatoes, etc. into equal-sized pieces to promote uniform cooking. Place in the pot without any water. Allow 1.5 hours to cook. Making Water s afe to Drink Contrary to popular belief, water does not have to be boiled to be safe to drink. Heating water to 150°F for 20 minutes pasteurizes the water, making it safe to drink. Pasteurization kills all human disease pathogens, without wasting the energy needed to bring the water to a boil. If you don’t have a thermometer to ensure that the water has reached 150°F, boiling the water guarantees that the water temperature is at least 212°F."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"GADGETS AND GI z MOS 11 What to Do 1. Place the bucket on your head, and then, us - ing the pencil, draw a line from the rim of the bucket to the height of your eyebrows to make rectangular shapes to be cut from the bucket, leaving a nose guard. 2. Using the scissors, cut out the rectangles, re- moving any excess plastic to customize the size of the helmet. 3. Cut the sheet of acetate from a clear plastic folder, making sure it is large enough to fit inside the bucket and cover the rectangular cutouts. Using duct tape, attach the acetate to the inside of the plastic helmet. 4. For greater protection and comfort, pad the inside of the jug with foam rubber, Styrofoam, or Bubble Wrap. 5. Use the bucket handle as a loose chin strap, or to make a more secure chin strap (to prevent the helmet from flying off your head during an accident), tear off a 6-inch length of duct tape, fold it in half lengthwise (sticking the tape to itself), and then use additional strips of duct tape to adhere each end of the chin strap to the inside sides of the bucket. How It Works Wear the bucket jammed tightly over your head and ears.

Find the external antenna jack on the backside of your cell phone, typically covered by a small rubber casing. Pry off the rub- ber cover to reveal a coaxial connector jack. Take a metal paper clip and straighten the outer loop. With a pair of needle-nose pliers, bend ¼ inch of the end of the paper clip at a 90-degree angle. Insert the bent end of the paper clip into the coaxial connector on your cell phone and let the paper clip rest on the backside of your phone.

How It Works The heads of the two metal screws touch each other, completing the cir- cuit and sounding the buzzer. Placing an aspirin tablet between the two heads of the screws breaks the circuit. If the basement should start to fill with water, the water will dissolve the aspirin tablet, causing the spring- activated clothespin to snap the metal screw heads together, completing the circuit again and allowing electricity from the battery to trigger the buzzer.

The cardboard (or foam) does not absorb sound effectively. How - ever, egg cartons do reduce echo just as effectively as expensive acoustic foam. Normally, sound bounces off a wall, heads toward the opposite wall, and then bounces back continually, until the sound waves dissipate. The cardboard absorbs some of the sound, and the shape of the egg cartons disperses the reflected sound waves, scattering them about the room, minimizing any echo. While egg cartons on the walls certainly look low budget, they also give the room a flatter frequency response and a lower overall level of reverberation. s ound o ff •\t State-of-the-art acoustic paneling usually adorns the walls of concert halls and recording studios to minimize sound waves bouncing off flat surfaces. •\t Many garage bands insist that adhering egg cartons to the walls does provide a form of soundproofing that outperforms bare walls. •\t Sheets of soundproofing foam shaped like egg cartons and purchased to insulate walls is both more effective and costlier than using the cardboard egg cartons.

How It Works Electrical resistance causes the steel wool to spark and glow red hot, and the iron filings from the steel wool sparkle like a Fourth of July sparkler. The iron threads in the steel wool, surrounded by oxygen, easily combust. p laying with Fire •\t Th e steel wool never actually ignites into a flame. Instead, the iron threads turn into glowing embers, which can be used to blow tinder into a flame. •\t Steel wool requires roughly 3 volts of electricity to spark and turn into embers. A single AA or AAA battery supplies only 1.5 volts of electricity and will not ignite steel wool. However, two AA or AAA batteries placed in series (end to end, with the positive end of one battery touching the negative end of the other battery) provide the necessary 3 volts and will ignite steel wool. •\t Most cell phone batteries deliver more than 3 volts and will ignite steel wool.

Use a pair of wire cutters to cut the electrical wire in half, and strip 1 inch from both ends of the two pieces of wire. Connect the end of one wire to the positive post on the battery; connect the end of the second wire to the negative post. Twist the two remaining ends of wire together. The two ends twisted together will start to heat up and glow orange. Touch the glowing ember to tinder and blow gently to ignite a fire. Once the fire starts up, take the battery away from it. •\t If you’re stranded in the middle of nowhere with a car, you can start a campfire with jumper cables and the car battery. Place some tinder on the ground, carefully attach the jumper cables to the battery terminals, and strike the positive and negative leads together over the tinder. The resulting spark should ignite the tinder. To make the tinder more flammable, before connecting the jumper cables to the battery, mix ¼ teaspoon of gasoline ( no more! ) with the tinder and let it sit for a minute to allow the gas fumes to rise. When you strike the leads of the jumper cable together over the prepared tinder, the gas fumes should ignite instantly. Adding Fuel to the Fire To siphon gasoline from a motor vehicle, place an empty container on the ground, uncap the gas tank, and insert a clear tube (1 inch in diameter and long enough to reach from the bottom of the gas tank to the can on the ground) into the gas tank.

Cook While the Iron Is Hot •\t In 1882, Henry W. Weely invented the first electric iron. When plugged into its stand, the iron heated up. While being used, the iron cooled down rapidly, requiring the user to continually reheat the iron. •\t Steam irons, first introduced in 1926, did not catch on until the late 1940s, when clothing makers introduced synthetic fabrics that scorched easily under a hot iron. To sell more irons, steam iron manu- facturers began increasing the number of steam holes as a competitive marketing gimmick. The number of holes in the bottom of a steam iron slowly escalated from eight large holes to seventy small holes—in what industry insiders called a “holey war.” •\t In his 1957 novel On the Road , Jack Kerouac describes heating up a can of pork and beans with a clothes iron: “We found a nightclub singer in her hotel room who turned an iron upside down on a coat hanger in the wastebasket and warmed up a can of pork and beans.” •\t In the 1993 film Benny & Joon , Johnny Depp cooks a stack of grilled cheese sandwiches using a clothes iron. •\t In an emergency, you can heat up a frozen TV dinner on the manifold of a running car engine.

Choose whichever end of the toothbrush will make the best knife blade. If the handle grip is thick rubber, choose the bristle end for the knife blade and remove the bristles (either by scraping them off, cutting them off, or using matches to melt them off). 2. Rub the toothbrush back and forth against a rough concrete or brick surface to file down the wide sides of the plastic to make the knife blade. Make the knife blade nar- rower near the tip of the toothbrush but thick enough to withstand breaking upon impact. The finer the grit in the stone, the finer you can sharpen the blade. For best results, start off sharpening the knife on rough grit and finish on finer grit. 3. To sharpen the knife with greater precision, add a few drops of baby oil or water to the stone. The lubricant reduces the heat produced from the friction created by rubbing the plastic against the stone. Too much heat can warp the blade. Lubrication also helps clear away the debris generated by grinding the plastic against the stone. 4. To sharpen the blade, hold the edge of the knife against the stone at the angle you want to make the blade, then slowly stroke the knife along the stone while simultaneously pulling the knife back toward you (to sharpen the entire edge). Continue making long strokes along the entire edge, keeping the angle consistent. 5. If the plastic is sufficiently firm, create a spearhead at the end of the blade by filing the two narrow sides to a tapered point. 6.

If you are exposed to radioactive iodine for more than 24 hours, take an additional dose of potassium iodide once every 24 hours for each day you are exposed. A single dose of potassium iodide protects the thyroid gland for 24 hours. Newborns and women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not take more than one dose of potassium iodide. How It Works The iodine flushes out and replaces any radioactive iodine in your system and prevents the thyroid gland from absorbing radioactive iodine-131. A thyroid gland full of natural iodine has no room to absorb iodine-131, protecting you against radiation-induced thyroid cancer. Radioactivities •\t The thyroid, a small, butterfly-shaped gland in the neck, uses iodine to make a hormone that controls metabolism, regulating growth and development.

When radioactive particles settle onto plants, soil, and water, people eat fruits and vegetables tainted with iodine-131 and drink water containing the isotope. Cows that eat grass contaminated with iodine-131 produce milk that contains the radioactive element. •\t The sooner you take potassium iodide after contamination, the quicker the thyroid will fill up with stable iodine. •\t Taking a stronger dose of potassium iodide, or taking potassium iodide more often than recommended, does not provide any additional protec - tion. Doing so can cause severe illness or even death. •\t The side effects of taking potassium iodide may include stomach upset, allergic reactions, rashes, and inflammation of the salivary glands. •\t Follow-up health studies conducted after the 1986 explosion and melt - down of the nuclear reactor at Chernobyl revealed a significant increase in thyroid cancer in the Chernobyl area, most notably among children who were under 10 years old at the time of the explosion. Children are most susceptible to the effects of iodine-131, possibly because their thyroid glands are still developing. •\t Thyroid cancer is one of the least deadly forms of cancer.

Wipe down your body with the saturated diaper to give yourself a refreshing sponge bath and rehydrate your skin. 3. Wear the waterlogged diaper on your head or around the back of your neck to replenish your body with moisture and cool your body temperature. How It Works Pampers diapers are filled with superabsorbent polymer flakes that absorb up to 300 times their weight in water. Because the polymer requires more time than paper to absorb liquid, scientists added an absorbent paper liner before the core to hold the liquid until the polymer fully absorbs it. Under the first thin layer of absorbent padding is a layer of polyfilm, a thin, woven polyresin whose fibers channel the liquid toward the absorbent core. The pores in the polyfilm are big enough to let air flow in, allowing the diaper to breathe, but small enough to keep liquid from flowing out, preventing the diaper from leaking. Holding the wet diaper against your body allows your skin cells to absorb the water through osmosis. The coolness also lowers your body temperature.

Place another stone or coin on the top end of the shadow tip’s new position. Draw a straight line through the two stones or coins. The line indicates an approximate east-west direction. Since the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, the first shadow tip will be west of the second shadow tip.

Using a paper towel or rag, wipe off the chocolate, polishing the bot - tom of the can to a glimmering shine. ( Do not eat the chocolate after rubbing it against the can. The chocolate removes the oxide layer on the surface of the aluminum, exposing the bare metal, which can be toxic.) 4. Repeat the process several times until the bottom of the can shines with a mirror finish. (If you hold an object close to the bottom of the can, you should see a clear image distorted by the curvature of the can.) 5. Find a direct ray of sunlight and angle the can to make sure its bottom reflects the sun’s rays. If not, continue polishing. 6. Place tinder in an appropriate spot, and hold the can 1 or 2 inches away from the center of the tinder, using the bottom of the can to reflect the concentrated beam of sunlight onto the tinder.

Remove the reflec- tor from the flashlight, place tinder (or toilet paper) in the hole in the center of the reflector where the bulb normally goes, and aim the reflector at the sun to converge the rays of sunlight on the end of the tinder until it smolders. A cigarette pushed up from the back of the hole also makes effective tinder. Fire Away •\t To build a fire, find a spot on dry land protected from wind and pre- cipitation. If necessary, dig a fire pit. If the ground is wet, build a dry platform with some logs. •\t Before building a fire, gather tinder, kindling, and large pieces of wood. For tinder, bundle dry grasses into the shape of a bird’s nest. For kin- dling, collect small, dry twigs and sticks the size of a wood pencil, or find several 1-inch-thick sticks and use a knife to cut slices that remain attached to the stick and curl away from it, creating what are called fuzz sticks. For large pieces of wood, gather dry branches the size of your forearm. •\t Place the tinder bundle on the ground, and build a tepee of kindling over it, leaving space between the sticks for the fire to breathe. Keep the large pieces of wood nearby. •\t To light the fire, kneel by the tinder and kindling. Using your body to shield against the wind, use a match or butane lighter to ignite the tinder. Add more kindling to the fire, generating a strong blaze, and once the fire takes hold, gradually add larger pieces of wood. •\t To roll your own newspaper logs using a broom, unscrew the broomstick from the bristles, fold two or three sheets of newsprint in half, and wrap them around the broomstick as tightly as possible.

Rake the bottle caps along the side of the fish in the opposite direction that the scales grow. •\t While fishing, store your bait in a leg cut from a pair of clean, used panty hose. Tie the open end of the panty hose leg to a tree branch or fence post for safekeeping. •\t Use clean, empty 2-liter soda bottles or a plastic prescription pill bottle, tightly capped, as buoys to mark fishing spots. Tie one end of a string around the neck of the bottle, with the other end tied to a heavy stone to anchor the buoy. •\t The best fishing is generally at dawn and dusk. On lakes and ponds, fish generally dwell in the deepest, coolest water or in shaded areas. •\t In shallow streams, fish typically congregate in shaded spots under hanging vegetation, logs across the stream, or undercuts of banks. Fish also linger in stagnant pools created by backwashes and behind rocks blocking the current. •\t Try to catch several small fish rather than spending all your energy and resources trying to catch a big one. •\t If possible, set out several fishing lines to increase your odds of catching something. To do so, cut several lengths of line, tie a hook to each one, bait the hooks, and hang each line from a tree limb extending over the water, allowing the hooks to sink up to 2 feet in the water."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"142 LAST MINUTE SURVIV AL SECRETS Ev E ry t ri C k in th E Book t he h andy p aper Clip The paper clip, invented and patented in 1899 by Norwegian inven- tor Johan Vaaler, boasts a profusion of alternative uses, which, if written on individual index cards, could be held together with—you guessed it—a paper clip. •\t Bookmark.

Both honey and sugar are hygroscopic, meaning they absorb moisture from wounds, making the wound an inhospitable environment for bacteria and sealing out contaminants. To prevent infection, coat the wound with honey or sugar. Honey dries to form a unique bandage. If the sugar turns into a runny glaze (indicating loss of its hygroscopic ability and bacteria-killing ability), clean up the substance and reapply the sugar. •\t In a pinch, use a clean Pampers disposable diaper as a compress to stop a knife wound from bleeding. •\t Applying Purell Instant Hand Sanitizer disinfects a wound and helps stop the bleeding. The ethyl alcohol in the gel is an antiseptic. Or pour vodka over the wound.

For both bee and wasp stings, make a paste of meat tenderizer and water and immediately apply the paste to the sting. 3. Keep the paste on for up to 30 minutes. How It Works When a bee injects its stinger into flesh, muscles still active in the stinger burrow it deeper into the wound, while other muscles continue pumping venom into your body. Removing the stinger from the skin prevents this from happening. The enzyme papain in meat tenderizer breaks down the proteins in the venom, relieving the stinging sensation and reducing inflammation. Buzz o ff •\t Bees have stingers for self-defense. Wasps (including hornets and yel- low jackets) use their stingers to hunt insects, spiders, and caterpillars to feed their larva. The stinger of a worker honeybee usually detaches when the insect attacks, and the honeybee dies a few hours later. A bumblebee or wasp retains its stinger, enabling it to sting repeatedly. •\t Insect venom can trigger an allergic reaction, the severity of which depends on the individual’s sensitivity. •\t Bees pollinate fruit trees, vegetable plants, and flowers.

The average person breaks out in a rash after coming into contact with just one ten-millionth of a gram of urushiol oil. •\t Once you come into contact with poison ivy, poison oak, or poison su- mac, you have 15 minutes to wash off the urushiol—the sticky oil that adheres to your skin—before your body launches an allergic reaction."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"F IRST A ID E MERGENCIES 183 •\t To avoid contact with poison plants, abide by the adage “Leaves of three, let it be.” •\t The blistery rash from poison ivy, appearing anywhere from 2 hours to two weeks after contact with urushiol, generally lasts three weeks but can linger for up to eight weeks. •\t A poison ivy, poison oak, or poison sumac rash is not contagious, nor can the fluid from a blister spread the rash. •\t Inhaling smoke from burning poison ivy, poison oak, or poison sumac can irritate or injure your eyes or nasal passages. The smoke contains the urushiol oil. •\t Although dogs and cats are immune to urushiol, their coats can get cov - ered with the oil, which can then come into contact with you or others. •\t To avoid getting poison ivy, poison oak, or poison sumac, learn how to recognize these poison plants before venturing into the wild, and if necessary wear long pants and a long-sleeved shirt. •\t If the rash covers a large area of your body and feels excruciating, or if the rash affects your eyes, mouth, or private parts, consult a doctor. Also seek medication attention if the blisters ooze (to prevent infec - tion) or the rash lasts longer than three weeks."},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"184 LAST - MINUTE SURVIVAL SECRETS h ow to r emove Cactus s pines with Elmer’ s g lue What You n eed •\t Whi te glue •\t Antibiotic ointment •\t Adhesive bandages What to Do 1. Attempting to remove a cactus spine from your skin can inadvertently drive the spine deeper into the skin. Instead, pour a dollop of white glue (approximately the size of a nickel) over each embedded spine, making sure to coat the part of the needle protruding from the skin. 2. Let the glue dry undisturbed. This should take up to 30 minutes. 3. To remove the cactus spine, peel the dried glue off the skin, in the opposite direction from how the spine went into the skin. 4. Wash the affected area with antibacterial soap, dry thoroughly, and ap- ply antibiotic ointment and an adhesive bandage to prevent infection. How It Works The dried glue adheres to the cactus spine, so when you peel off the glue, the cactus spine comes out with it. s tuck on You •\t Using g lue to remove a cactus spine from skin is similar to using hot wax to remove unwanted body hair. Hair-removing wax cloths or body wax can also be used to remove cactus spines as well. •\t You can also remove cactus spines from skin with a strip of duct tape, but stripping the duct tape from the skin is more painful than peeling off dried glue. •\t To remove thin, hairlike cactus spines from the skin, put on a pair of rubber gloves and brush the affected area with a balled-up pair of clean, used panty hose in the opposite direction that the cactus spine went into the skin. The panty hose removes the needles, which adhere to the nylon hose. Discard the panty hose and gloves. •\t Soaking the affected area with warm water for 10 to 15 minutes engorges the spine and softens the skin, making the thorn easier to remove with tweezers. •\t To remove small cactus needles, rubbing a sheet of paper towel satu- rated with baby oil across the affected area removes most of the needles."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"F IRST A ID E MERGENCIES 185 h ow to s oothe s evere s unburn p ain with i ced t ea Mix What You n eed •\t Jar o f powdered ice tea mix •\t Bathtub •\t Water What to Do 1.

Move the victim inside a warm, dry shelter. 3. Remove any wet clothes from the person and pat the skin dry with a towel. 4. If the individual is conscious, have him or her dress in dry clothes. 5. Wrap the clothed person in aluminum foil, with the shiny side facing the body. For greater effectiveness, wrap the person in a blanket and then wrap the aluminum foil around the blanket. 6. Also wrap aluminum foil (shiny side in) around the victim’s socks or shoes. 7. If you wish to have the victim lie down, place a layer of aluminum foil under a blanket or sleeping bag and have the victim lie on top of that. This helps reflect body heat to keep the victim warmer. How It Works Excessive body heat loss leads to hypothermia, but wrapping the body in aluminum foil reflects body heat back to the body and stops both evapora- tive and convective heat loss. When a person perspires in cold weather, the perspiration evaporates, making the body colder. The aluminum foil helps slow the process of evaporative heat loss by increasing the humidity of the air next to the skin. In convective heat loss, cold wind takes the warmth away from the body.

Gently pull the ends of the floss, to pull the center of the two sides of the wound together, and tie a double knot—just tightly enough to seal the wound without killing the tissue. 11. Using the scissors, clip off the excess dental floss. 12. Sew a second suture halfway between one end of the laceration and the middle stitch. 13. Sew a third suture halfway between the opposite end of the laceration and the middle stitch. 14. Repeat the process of sewing sutures halfway between existing stitches until you have effectually sealed the wound. 15. Keep the stitches dry to prevent water from getting into the wound, increasing the risk of infection, and potentially opening the wound after the stitches are removed. 16. Seek medical attention as soon as possible. If medical attention is unavailable, remove the stitches after 5 days for a face gash, 7 days for a laceration on the body, and 10 to 14 days for a gash on the foot.

Remove the nozzle of the superglue tube from the puncture and cover the puncture hole with the glue. 4. Let it sit for 5 minutes. 5. Inflate the tire with air and drive to the nearest repair shop to have the tire properly repaired or replaced. How It Works The cyanoacrylate is a strong, fast-acting adhesive capable of sealing a puncture in a rubber tire—temporarily. Unfortunately, cyanoacrylate dries solid, making it inflexible and brittle. When the rubber tire flexes and the temperature of the tire tread cause the rubber to expand and contract, the bond between the rubber and the superglue could break or crack. s ticky Fingers •\t Su perglue cannot be used to fill holes because thin layers of cyanoac - rylate bond far more effectively than thick layers. If the puncture has created a gap, fill the gap with baking soda and then add a few drops of superglue over the baking soda. The cyanoacrylate glue and baking soda harden into a lightweight adhesive filler. Caution: the reaction between cyanoacrylate and baking soda produces heat and noxious vapors. •\t Early models of the Volkswagen Beetle used the air pressure from the spare tire to shoot water from the windshield washer reservoir. •\t To locate a puncture in a tire, use an air compressor to fill the tire with air.
