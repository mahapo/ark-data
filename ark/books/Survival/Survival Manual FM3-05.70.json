[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":" 1 Preface As a soldier, you can be sent to a ny area of the world. It may be in a temperate, tropical, arctic, or subarctic region. You expect to have all your pe rsonal equipment and your unit members with you wherever you go. However, there is no guarantee it wi ll be so. You could find yourself alone in a remote area—possibly enemy territory—with little or no pe rsonal gear. This manual provides information and describes basic techniques that will enable you to survive and return alive should you find yourself in such a situation. If you are a trainer, use this information as a base on which to build survival training. You know the areas to which your unit is likely to deploy, the means by which it will travel, and th e territory through which it will travel. Read what this manual says about survival in those particular areas and find out all you can about those areas. Read other books on survival. Develop a survival-tra ining program that will enable your unit members to meet any survival situation they may face. It can make the difference between life and death.

"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" 2 Chapter 1 Introduction This manual is based entirely on th e keyword SURVIVAL. The letters in this word can help guide your actions in any survival situation. Learn what each lett er represents and practice applying these guidelines when conducting survival training. Remember the word SURVIVAL . SURVIVAL ACTIONS 1-1. The following paragraphs expand on the meani ng of each letter of the word survival. Study and remember what each letter signifies because some day you may have to make the word work for you. S—Size Up the Situation 1-2. If you are in a combat situation, find a place where you can conceal yourself from the enemy. Remember, security takes priority. Use your senses of hearing, smell, and sight to get a feel for the battlespace. Determine if the enem y is attacking, defending, or withdr awing. You will have to consider what is developing on the battlespace when you make your survival plan. Surroundings 1-3. Determine the pattern of the area. Get a feel for what is going on around you. Every environment, whether forest, jungle, or desert, ha s a rhythm or pattern. This tempo includes animal and bird noises and movements and insect sounds. It may also include enemy traffic and civilian movements. Physical Condition 1-4. The pressure of the battle you we re in or the trauma of being in a survival situatio n may have caused you to overlook wounds you received. Check your wounds and give yourself first aid. Take care to prevent further bodily harm. For instance, in any climat e, drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration. If you are in a cold or wet climate, put on additional clothing to prevent hypothermia. Equipment 1-5. Perhaps in the heat of battle, you lost or da maged some of your equipment. Check to see what equipment you have and what condition it is in. 1-6. Now that you have sized up your situation, su rroundings, physical condition, and equipment, you are ready to make your survival plan. In doing so, keep in mind your basic physical needs—water, food, and shelter. U—Use All Your Senses, Undue Haste Makes Waste 1-7. You may make a wrong move when you react quickly without thinking or planning. That move may result in your capture or death. Don' t move just for the sake of taking action. Consider all aspects of your situation before you make a decision and a move. If you act in haste, you may forget or lose some of your equipment. In your haste you may also become disori ented so that you don't know which way to go. Plan your moves. Be ready to move out quickly without endangering yourself if the enemy is near you. Use all"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" 3 your senses to evaluate the situa tion. Note sounds and smells. Be sensitive to temperature changes. Always be observant. R—Remember Where You Are 1-8. Spot your location on your map and relate it to the su rrounding terrain. This ba sic principle is one that you must always follow. If there are other persons with you, make sure they also know their location. Always know who in your group, vehicle, or aircraft has a map and compass. If that person is killed, you will have to get the map and compass from him. Pa y close attention to wher e you are and where you are going. Do not rely on others in the group to keep track of the route. Constantly orient yourself. Always try to determine, as a minimum, how your location relates to the location of— • Enemy units and controlled areas. • Friendly units and controlled areas. • Local water sources (especially important in the desert). • Areas that will provide good cover and concealment. 1-9. This information will allow you to make intelligen t decisions when you are in a survival and evasion situation. V—Vanquish Fear and Panic 1-10. The greatest enemies in a combat survival and evasion situation ar e fear and panic. If uncontrolled, they can destroy your ability to make an intelligent decision. They may cause you to react to your feelings and imagination rather than to your situation. Thes e emotions can drain your energy and thereby cause other negative emotions. Previous survival and ev asion training and self-confidence will enable you to vanquish fear and panic. I—Improvise 1-11. In the United States (U.S.), we have items available for all our needs. Many of these items are cheap to replace when damaged. Our easy-come, easy-go, easy- to-replace culture makes it unnecessary for us to improvise. This inexperience in \"making do\" can be an enemy in a survival situ ation. Learn to improvise. Take a tool designed for a speci fic purpose and see how many other uses you can make of it. 1-12. Learn to use natural objects around you for different needs. An example is using a rock for a hammer. No matter how complete a survival kit you have with you, it will run out or wear out after a while. Your imagination must take over when your kit wears out. V—Value Living 1-13. All of us were born kicking and fighting to live, bu t we have become used to the soft life. We have become creatures of comfort. We dislike inconveniences and discomfo rts. What happens when we are faced with a survival situation with its stresses, inc onveniences, and discomforts? This is when the will to live—placing a high value on living—is vital. The experience and knowledge you have gained through life and your Army training will have a bearing on your will to live. Stubbornness, a refusal to give in to problems and obstacles that face you, will give y ou the mental and physical strength to endure. A—Act Like the Natives"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" 4 1-14. The natives and animals of a region have adapted to their environment. To get a feel of the area, watch how the people go about their daily routine. When and what do they eat? When, where, and how do they get their food? When and where do they go for water? What time do they usually go to bed and get up? These actions are important to you when you are trying to avoid capture. 1-15. Animal life in the area can also give you clues on how to survive. Animals also require food, water, and shelter. By watching them, you can find sources of water and food. WARNING Animals cannot serve as an absolute guide to what you can eat and drink. Many animals eat plants that are toxic to humans. 1-16. Keep in mind that the reaction of animals can reveal your presence to the enemy. 1-17. If in a friendly area, one way you can gain rapport with the natives is to show interest in their tools and how they get food and water. By studying the pe ople, you learn to respect them, you often make valuable friends, and, most important, you learn how to adapt to their environment and increase your chances of survival. L—Live by Your Wits, But for Now, Learn Basic Skills 1-18. Without training in basic skills for surviving a nd evading on the battlespace, your chances of living through a combat survival and evasion situation are slight. 1-19. Learn these basic skills now— not when you are headed for or are in the battle. How you decide to equip yourself before deployment will affect whether or not you survive. You need to know about the environment to which you are going, and you must practic e basic skills geared to that environment. For instance, if you are going to a desert , you need to know how to get water. 1-20. Practice basic survival skills during all training programs and exer cises. Survival training reduces fear of the unknown and gives you self-confiden ce. It teaches you to live by your wits. PATTERN FOR SURVIVAL 1-21. Develop a survival pattern that lets you beat th e enemies of survival. This survival pattern must include food, water, shelter, fire, first aid, and sign als placed in order of importance. For example, in a cold environment, you would need a fire to get warm; a shelter to protect you from the cold, wind, and rain or snow; traps or snares to get food ; a means to signal friendly aircraft; and first aid to maintain health. If you are injured, first aid has t op priority no matter what climate you are in. 1-22. Change your survival pattern to meet your immediate physical needs as the environment changes. As you read the rest of this manual, keep in mi nd the keyword SURVIVAL, what each letter signifies (Figure 1-1 ), and the need for a survival pattern."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" 5 Figure 1-1. Guidelines for Survival Chapter 2 Psychology of Survival It takes much more than the knowledge and skills to build shelters, get food, make fires, and travel without the aid of standard naviga tional devices to live successfully through a survival situation. Some people with little or no survival training have managed to survive life-threatening circumstances. Some people with survival training have not used their skills and died. A key ingredient in any survival situation is the mental attitude of the i ndividual involved. Having survival skil ls is important; having the will to survive is essential. Without a de sire to survive, acquired skills serve little purpose and invaluable knowledge goes to waste. There is a psychology to survival. Y ou will face many stressors in a survival environment that ultimately will affect your mind. These stressors can produce t houghts and emotions that, if poorly understood, can transform a confident, well-trained person into an indecisive, ineffective i ndividual with questionable ability to survive. Thus, you must be aware of and be able to recognize those stressors commonly associated with survival. It is also imperative that you be aware of your reactions to the wide variety of stressors associated with survival. This chapter identifie s and explains the nature of stress, the stressors of survival, and those internal reactions that you will naturally experience wh en faced with the stressors of a real-world survival situation. The knowledge you gain fr om this chapter and the re mainder of this manual, will prepare you to come through the toughest times alive . A LOOK AT STRESS 2-1. Before we can understand our psychological reactions in a survival setting, it is helpful to first know a little bit about stress and its effects. Stress is not a disease that you cure and eliminate. Instead, it is a condition we all experience. Stress can be described as our reaction to pre ssure. It is the name given to the experience we have as we physica lly, mentally, emotionally, and spir itually respond to life's tensions."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" 6 NEED FOR STRESS 2-2. We need stress because it has many positive benef its. Stress provides us with challenges; it gives us chances to learn about our values and strengths. Stress can show our ability to handle pressure without breaking. It tests our adaptability and flexibility, and can stimulate us to do our best. Because we usually do not consider unimportant events stressful, stress can also be an excellent i ndicator of the significance we attach to an event—in other words, it highlights what is important to us. 2-3. We need to have some stress in our lives, but too much of anythi ng can be bad. The goal is to have stress, but not an excess of it. T oo much stress can take its toll on people and organizations. Too much stress leads to distress. Distress causes an uncomfortab le tension that we try to escape or, preferably, avoid. Listed below are a few of the common signs of distress that you may encounter when faced with too much stress: • Difficulty making decisions. • Angry outbursts. • Forgetfulness. • Low energy level. • Constant worrying. • Propensity for mistakes. • Thoughts about death or suicide. • Trouble getting along with others. • Withdrawing from others. • Hiding from responsibilities. • Carelessness. 2-4. As you can see, stress can be constructive or destructive. It can encourage or discourage, move us along or stop us dead in our tracks, and make life meaningful or seemingly meaningless. Stress can inspire you to operate successfully a nd perform at your maximum efficiency in a survival situation. It can also cause you to panic and forget all your training. Y our key to survival is your ability to manage the inevitable stresses you will encounter. The person that survives is one who works with his stresses instead of letting his stresses work on him. SURVIVAL STRESSORS 2-5. Any event can lead to stress and, as everyone has experienced, events don't always come one at a time. Often, stressful events occur simultaneously. Thes e events are not stress, but they produce it and are called \"stressors.\" Stress ors are the obvious cause while stress is the response. Once the body recognizes the presence of a stressor, it then begins to act to protect itself. 2-6. In response to a stressor, the body prepares either to \"fight or flee.\" This preparation involves an internal SOS sent throughout the body. As the body re sponds to this SOS, the following actions take place: • The body releases stored fuels (sugar and fats) to provide quick energy. • Breathing rate increases to s upply more oxygen to the blood. • Muscle tension increases to prepare for action. • Blood clotting mechanisms are activated to redu ce bleeding from cuts."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 7 • Senses become more acute (hearing becomes more sensitive, pupils dilate, smell becomes sharper) so that you are more aware of your surroundings. • Heart rate and blood pressure rise to provide more blood to the muscles. This protective posture lets you cope with potential dangers. However, you cannot maintain this level of alertness indefinitely. 2-7. Stressors are not courteous; one stressor does not leave because anot her one arrives. Stressors add up. The cumulative effect of minor stressors can be a majo r distress if they all happen too close together. As the body's resistance to stress wears do wn and the sources of stress contin ue (or increase), eventually a state of exhaustion arrives. At this point, the ability to resist stress or use it in a positive way gives out and signs of distress appear. Anticipatin g stressors and developing strategi es to cope with them are two ingredients in the effective management of stress. Therefore, it is esse ntial that you be aware of the types of stressors that you will encounter. The following paragraphs expl ain a few of these. Injury, Illness, or Death 2-8. Injury, illness, and death are re al possibilities that you have to face . Perhaps nothing is more stressful than being alone in an unfamiliar environment where you could die from hostile action, an accident, or from eating something lethal. Illness and injury ca n also add to stress by limiting your ability to maneuver, get food and drink, find shelter, and defend yourself. Even if illness and injury don't lead to death, they add to stress through the pain and discomfort they generate. It is onl y by controlling the stress associated with the vulnerability to injury, illness, and death that you can have the courage to take the risks associated with survival tasks. Uncertainty and Lack of Control 2-9. Some people have trouble operating in settings where everything is not clear-cut. The only guarantee in a survival situation is that nothing is guarant eed. It can be extremely stressful operating on limited information in a setting where you have limited control of your surroundings . This uncertainty and lack of control also add to the stress of being ill, injured, or killed. Environment 2-10. Even under the most ideal circumstances, nature is quite formidable. In survival, you will have to contend with the stressors of weathe r, terrain, and the variety of creatur es inhabiting an area. Heat, cold, rain, winds, mountains, swamps, desert s, insects, dangerous reptiles, a nd other animals are just a few of the challenges that you will encounter while worki ng to survive. Depending on how you handle the stress of your environment, your surroundings can be either a source of food and protecti on or can be a cause of extreme discomfort leading to injury, illness, or death. Hunger and Thirst 2-11. Without food and water you will weaken and eventu ally die. Thus, getti ng and preserving food and water takes on increasing importance as the length of time in a survival setting increases. Foraging can also be a big source of stress since you are used to having your provisions issued. Fatigue"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 8 2-12. Forcing yourself to con tinue surviving is not easy as you grow more tired. It is possible to become so fatigued that the act of just staying awake is stressful in itself. Isolation 2-13. There are some advantages to facing adversity w ith others. As a soldier you learn individual skills, but you train to function as part of a team. Although we complain abou t higher headquarters, we become used to the information and guidance it provides, esp ecially during times of c onfusion. Being in contact with others also provides a greater sense of security and a feeling someone is available to help if problems occur. A significant stressor in survival situations is that often you have to rely solely on your own resources. 2-14. The survival stressors mentioned in this section are by no means th e only ones you may face. Remember, what is stressful to one person may not be stressful to another. Your experiences, training, personal outlook on life, physical and mental conditioning, and level of self-confidence contribute to what you will find stressful in a survival environment. The object is not to avoid stress, but rather to manage the stressors of survival and make them work for you. 2-15. We now have a general knowledge of stress and th e stressors common to survival. The next step is to examine your reactions to the stressors you may face. NATURAL REACTIONS 2-16. Man has been able to survive many shifts in his environment thro ughout the centuries. His ability to adapt physically and mentally to a changing world kept him alive while other species around him gradually died off. The same survival mechanisms that kept our forefathers alive can help keep you alive as well! However, the survival mechanisms that can help you can also work against you if you do not understand and anticipate their presence. 2-17. It is not surprising that the average person will have some psychological reactions in a survival situation. The following paragraphs e xplain some of the major internal reactions that you or anyone with you might experience with the previously stated survival stressors. FEAR 2-18. Fear is our emotional response to dangerous circumstances that we believe have the potential to cause death, injury, or illness. This harm is not just limited to physical damage; the threat to your emotional and mental well-being can generate fear as well. If you are trying to survive, fear can have a positive function if it encourages you to be cautious in situations where recklessness could result in injury. Unfortunately, fear can also immobilize you. It can cau se you to become so fri ghtened that you fail to perform activities essential for survival. Most peopl e will have some degree of fear when placed in unfamiliar surroundings under adverse conditions. There is no shame in this! You must train yourself not to be overcome by your fears. Ideally, through realis tic training, you can acquire the knowledge and skills needed to increase your confidence and thereby manage your fears. ANXIETY 2-19. Associated with fear is anxiety. Because it is natural for you to be afraid, it is also natural for you to experience anxiety. Anxiety can be an uneasy, apprehensive feeling you get when faced with dangerous"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 9 situations (physical, mental, and em otional). When used in a healthy way, anxiety can urge you to act to end, or at least master, the dangers that threaten your existe nce. If you were never anxious, there would be little motivation to make changes in your life. In a survival setting you can reduce your anxiety by performing those tasks that will ensure you come through the ordeal alive. As you reduce your anxiety, you also bring under control the so urce of that anxiety—your fears. In this form, anxiety is good; however, anxiety can also have a devastating imp act. Anxiety can overwhelm you to the point where you become easily confused and have difficulty thin king. Once this happens, it will become increasingly difficult for you to make good judgments and sound deci sions. To survive, you must learn techniques to calm your anxieties and keep them in the range where they help, not hurt. ANGER AND FRUSTRATION 2-20. Frustration arises when you are continually thwart ed in your attempts to reach a goal. The goal of survival is to stay alive until you can reach help or until help can reach you. To achieve this goal, you must complete some tasks with minimal resources. It is inevitable, in trying to do these tasks, that something will go wrong; that something will happen beyond your control; and th at with your life at stake, every mistake is magnified in terms of its im portance. Thus, eventually, you will have to cope with frustration when a few of your plans run into trouble. One outgrowth of th is frustration is anger. There are many events in a survival situation that can frus trate or anger you. Getting lost, damaged or forgotten equipment, the weather, inhospita ble terrain, enemy patrols, and phys ical limitations are just a few sources of frustration and anger. Frustration and anger generate impul sive reactions, irrational behavior, poorly thought-out decisions, and, in some instances, an \"I quit\" attitude (p eople sometimes avoid doing something they can't master). If you can harness and properly channel the emoti onal intensity associated with anger and frustration, you can productively act as you answer the challenges of survival. If you do not properly focus your angry feelin gs, you can waste much energy in ac tivities that do little to further either your chances of survival or the chances of those around you. DEPRESSION 2-21. You would be a rare person indeed if you did not get sad, at least momentarily, when faced with the hardships of survival. As this sadness deepens, it becomes \"depression.\" Depression is closely linked with frustration and anger. Frustration will cause you to become increasi ngly angry as you fail to reach your goals. If the anger does not help you succeed, then the frustration level goes even higher. A destructive cycle between anger and frustration will continue until you become worn down—physically, emotionally, and mentally. When you reach this point, you start to give up, and your focus shifts from \"What can I do\" to \"There is nothing I can do.\" Depr ession is an expression of this hopeless, helpless feeling. There is nothing wrong with being sad as you temporarily think about your loved ones and remember what life is like back in \"civilization\" or \"the world.\" Such thoughts, in fact, can gi ve you the desire to try harder and live one more day. On the other hand, if you allow yourse lf to sink into a depressed state, then it can sap all your energy and, more important, your will to survive. It is impera tive that you resist succumbing to depression. LONELINESS AND BOREDOM 2-22. Man is a social animal. Human beings enjoy th e company of others. Very few people want to be alone all the time! There is a distin ct chance of isolation in a surviv al setting. Isolat ion is not bad. Loneliness and boredom can bring to the surface q ualities you thought only others had. The extent of your imagination and creativity may su rprise you. When required to do so, you may discover some hidden talents and abilities. Most of all, you may tap into a reservoir of inner stre ngth and fortitude you never knew you had. Conversely, loneliness and boredom can be another source of depression. If you are"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 10 surviving alone, or with others , you must find ways to keep your mind productively occupied. Additionally, you must develop a degree of self-sufficiency. You must have faith in your capability to \"go it alone.\" GUILT 2-23. The circumstances leading to your being in a su rvival setting are sometimes dramatic and tragic. It may be the result of an accident or military missi on where there was a loss of life. Perhaps you were the only survivor or one of a few survivors. While natura lly relieved to be alive, you simultaneously may be mourning the deaths of others who were less fortunate. It is not uncommon for survivors to feel guilty about being spared from death whil e others were not. This feeling, when used in a positive way, has encouraged people to try harder to survive with the belief they were allowed to live for some greater purpose in life. Sometimes, survivors tried to stay alive so that they could carry on the work of those killed. Whatever reason you give yo urself, do not let guilt feelings prevent you from living. The living who abandon their chance to survive accomplish nothing. Such an act would be the greatest tragedy. PREPARING YOURSELF 2-24. Your mission in a survival situation is to stay alive. The assortment of thoughts and emotions you will experience in a survival situation can work for you, or they can work to your downfall. Fear, anxiety, anger, frustration, guilt, depressi on, and loneliness are all possible reactions to the many stressors common to survival. These reactions, when controlled in a healthy way, help to increase your likelihood of surviving. They prompt you to pay more attention in training, to fight back when scared, to take actions that ensure sustenance and securit y, to keep faith with your fellow team members, and to strive against large odds. When you cannot control th ese reactions in a healthy way, th ey can bring you to a standstill. Instead of rallying your internal resources, you listen to your internal fears. Th ese fears will cause you to experience psychological defeat long before you physica lly succumb. Remember, survival is natural to everyone; being unexpectedly thrust into the life-or-death struggle of surviv al is not. Do not be afraid of your \"natural reactions to this unnatural situation.\" Prepare yourself to rule over these reactions so they serve your ultimate interest—staying alive with honor and dignity. 2-25. Being prepared involves knowing that your reac tions in a survival setting are productive, not destructive. The challenge of surv ival has produced countless examples of heroism, courage, and self- sacrifice. These are the qualities a survival situation can bring out in you if you have prepared yourself. Below are a few tips to help prep are yourself psychologically for su rvival. Through studying this manual and attending survival training you ca n develop the \"survival attitude.\" KNOW YOURSELF 2-26. You should take the time through training, fa mily, and friends to discover who you are on the inside. Strengthen your stronger qualities and develop the areas that you know ar e necessary to survive. ANTICIPATE FEARS 2-27. Don't pretend that you will have no fears. Begin th inking about what would frighten you the most if forced to survive alone. Train in t hose areas of concern to you. The goal is not to eliminate the fear, but to build confidence in your ability to function despite your fears. BE REALISTIC"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 11 2-28. Don't be afraid to make an honest appraisal of situations. See circumstances as they are, not as you want them to be. Keep your hopes and expectations within th e estimate of the situation. When you go into a survival setting with unrealis tic expectations, you may be la ying the groundwork for bitter disappointment. Follow the adage, \"Hope for the best, prep are for the worst.\" It is much easier to adjust to pleasant surprises about your unexpe cted good fortunes than to be upset by your unexpected harsh circumstances. ADOPT A POSITIVE ATTITUDE 2-29. Learn to see the potential good in everything. Looking for the good not only boosts morale, it also is excellent for exercising your imagination and creativity. REMIND YOURSELF WHAT IS AT STAKE 2-30. Failure to prepare yourself ps ychologically to cope with survival leads to reactions such as depression, carelessness, inattention, loss of conf idence, poor decision making, and giving up before the body gives in. Remember that your life and the li ves of others who depend on you are at stake. TRAIN 2-31. Through military training and life experiences, be gin today to prepare yourself to cope with the rigors of survival. Demonstrating your skills in training will give you the confidence to call upon them should the need arise. Remember, the more realistic the training, the less overwhelming an actual survival setting will be. LEARN STRESS MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES 2-32. People under stress have a potential to panic if they are not well-trained and not prepared psychologically to face whatever the circumstances may be. While you often cannot control the survival circumstances in which you find yourself, it is with in your ability to contro l your response to those circumstances. Learning stress management tec hniques can significantly e nhance your capability to remain calm and focused as you work to keep your self and others alive. A few good techniques to develop include relaxation skills, time management skills , assertiveness skills, and cognitive restructuring skills (the ability to control how you view a situation). Remember, \"the will to survive\" can also be considered \"the refusal to give up.\" Chapter 3 Survival Planning and Survival Kits A survival plan is dependent on three separate but intertwined parts to be successful: planning, preparation, and practice. Survival planning is nothing more than realizing something could happe n that would put you in a survival situation and, with that in mind, taking steps to in crease your chances of survival. It can happen to anyone, anywhere, anytime, so remember: failure to plan is a plan to fail . Plans are based on evasion and recovery (E&R) considerations and the availabil ity of resupply or emergency bundles. You must take into consideration the mission duration and the distance to friendly lines; the environment, to include the terrain and weather and possible cha nges in the weather duri ng a protracted mission; and the platform you"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 12 will be operating with, such as an aircraft, a multipur pose vehicle, or perhaps just a rucksack. Planning also entails looking at those E&R routes and knowing by memory the ma jor geographical features in case your map and compass are lost. You can use classified and unclassified sources such as the Internet, encyclopedias, and geographic mag azines to assist you in planning. Preparation means preparing yourself and your survival kit for those co ntingencies that you have in your plan. A plan without any preparation is just a piece of paper. It will not keep you alive. Prepare yourself by making sure your immunizations and dental work are up-to-date. Prepare your uniform by having the newest uniform for emergencies. It will have the mo st infrared-defeating capabilities possible. You can have signal devices and snare wire sewn into it ahead of time. Break in your boots and make sure that the boots have good soles and water-repe llent properties. Study the area, c limate, terrain, and indigenous methods of food and water procurement. You should c ontinuously assess data, even after the plan is made, to update the plan as necessary and give y ou the greatest possible chance of survival. Another example of preparation is finding the emergency exits on an aircraft when you board it for a flight. Practice those things that you have planned with the items in your surv ival kit. Checking ensures that items work and that you know how to use them. Build a fire in the rain so you know that when it is critical to get warm, you can do it. Review the medical items in your kit and have instructions printed on their use so that even in times of stre ss, you will not make life-threatening errors. IMPORTANCE OF PLANNING 3-1. Detailed prior planning is essen tial in potential survival situations . Including survival considerations in mission planning will enhance your ch ances of survival if an emerge ncy occurs. For example, if your job requires that you work in a small, enclosed ar ea that limits what you can carry on your person, plan where you can put your rucksack or your load-bearing equipment (LBE). Put it where it will not prevent you from getting out of the area quickly, yet where it is readily accessible. 3-2. One important aspect of prior planning is prev entive medicine. Ensuring th at you have no dental problems and that your immunizations are current will he lp you avoid potential dental or health problems. Some dental problems can progress to the point that you may not be able to eat enough to survive. Failure to keep your shots current may mean your body is not immune to diseases that are prevalent in the area. 3-3. Preparing and carrying a survival kit is as im portant as the considera tions mentioned above. All Army aircraft have survival kits on board for the t ype of area over which they will fly. There are kits for over-water, hot climate, and cold climate survival. Each crewmember will also be wearing an aviator survival vest ( Appendix A describes these survival ki ts). Know the location of these kits on the aircraft and what they contain in case of cr ash or ditching. There are also sold ier kits for tropical and temperate survival. These kits are expensive and not always available to every soldier. However, if you know what these kits contain, and on what basis they are built, you will be able to plan and to prepare your own survival kit that may be better suited to you than an off-the-shelf one. 3-4. Even the smallest survival kit, if properly prepar ed, is invaluable when faced with a survival problem. However, before making your survival kit, consider your unit's mission, the operational environment, and the equipment and vehicles assigned to your unit. SURVIVAL KITS 3-5. The environment is the key to the types of it ems you will need in your survival kit. How much equipment you put in your kit depends on how you will carry the kit. A kit car ried on your body will have"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 13 to be smaller than one carried in a vehicle. Alwa ys layer your survival kit—body, load-bearing vest or equipment, and platform (rucksack, vehicle, or airc raft). Keep the most important items on your body. For example, your map and compass should always be on your body, as should your basic life-sustaining items (knife, lighter). Carry less important item s on your LBE. Place bulky items in the rucksack. 3-6. In preparing your survival kit, select items th at are multipurpose, compact, lightweight, durable, and most importantly, functional. An item is not good if it looks great but doesn't do what it was designed for. Items should complement each other from layer to layer. A signal mirror in your pocket can be backed up by pen flares in your LBE and a signal panel in your rucksack. A lighter in your uniform can be augmented by a magnesium bar in your LBE and additional dry tinder in your rucksack. 3-7. Your survival kit need not be elaborate. You n eed only functional items that will meet your needs and a case to hold the items. For the cas e, you might want to use a bandage box, soap dish, tobacco tin, first- aid case, ammunition pouch, or another suitable case. This case should be— • Water-repellent or waterproof. • Easy to carry or attach to your body. • Suitable to accept various-sized components. • Durable. 3-8. Your survival kit should be brok en down into the following categories: • Water. • Fire. • Shelter. • Food. • Medical. • Signal. • Miscellaneous. 3-9. Each category should contain ite ms that allow you to sustain your basic needs. For example, water— you should have items that allow you to scoop up, dr aw up, soak up, or suck up water; something to gather rainwater, condensation, or pe rspiration; something to transport water; and something to purify or filter water. Some examples of each category are as follows: • Water—purification tablets, non- lubricated condoms for carrying water, bleach, povidone-iodine drops, cravats, sponges, small plastic or rubbe r tubing, collapsible canteens or water bags. • Fire—lighter, metal match, wate rproof matches, magnesium ba r, candle, magnifying lens. • Shelter—550 parachute cord, larg e knife, machete or hatchet, poncho, space blanket, hammock, mosquito net, wire saw. • Food—knife, snare wire, fishhooks, fish and snare line, bouillon cubes or soup packets, high- energy food bars, granola bars, gill or yeti net, aluminum foil, freezer bags. • Medical—oxytetracycline tablets (t o treat diarrhea or infection), surgical blades or surgical preparation knife, butterfly sutures, lip balm, sa fety pins, sutures, antidiarrheal medication (imodium), antimalarial medication (doxycycline) , broad-spectrum antibiotics (rocephin and zithromax) and broad spectrum topical ophthalmic (eye) antibiotic, antifun gal, anti-inflammatory (ibuprofen), petrolatum gauze, a nd soap. Medical items may make up approximately 50 percent of your survival kit."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" 14 • Signal—signaling mirror, strobe, pen flares, whistle, U.S. flag, pilot scarf or other bright orange silk scarf, glint tape, flashli ght, laser pointer, solar blanket. • Miscellaneous—wrist compass, needle and thread, money, extra eyeglasses, knife sharpener, cork, camouflage stick, and survival manual. 3-10. Include a weapon only if the situation so dictates. Ambassadors and theater commanders may prohibit weapons even in extreme circumstances. Read and practice the survival techniques in this manual and apply these basic concepts to those you read about in other civili an publications. Consider your mission and the environment in which you will operate. Then prepare your survival kit with items that are durable, multipurpose, and lightweight. Imagination may be the largest pa rt of your kit. It can replace many of the items in a kit. Combined with the will to live, it can mean the difference between surviving to return home with honor or not returning at all. Chapter 4 Basic Survival Medicine Foremost among the many problems that can compromi se your survival ability are medical problems resulting from unplanned events, such as a forced landing or crash, extrem e climates, ground combat, evasion, and illnesses contracted in captivity. Many evaders and survivors have reported difficulty in treating injuries and illness due to the lack of training and medical supplies. For some, this led to capture or surrender. Survivors have related feelings of apathy and helplessn ess because they could not treat themselves in this environment. The ability to treat yourself increases your morale and aids in your survival and eventual return to friendly forces. One man with a fair amount of basic medical knowle dge can make a difference in the lives of many. Without qualified medical personnel available, it is you who must know what to do to stay alive. REQUIREMENTS FOR MAINTENANCE OF HEALTH 4-1. To survive, you need water and food. You must al so have and apply high personal hygiene standards. WATER 4-2. Your body loses water through normal body processe s (sweating, urinating, and defecating). During average daily exertion when the atmospheric temperatur e is 20 degrees Celsius (C ) (68 degrees Fahrenheit [F]), the average adult loses and therefore requires 2 to 3 liters of water daily. Othe r factors, such as heat exposure, cold exposure, intense activ ity, high altitude, burns, or illness, can cause your body to lose more water. You must replace this water. 4-3. Dehydration results from inade quate replacement of lost body fluids. It decreases your efficiency and, if you are injured, it increases y our susceptibility to severe shock. Consider the following results of body fluid loss: • A 5-percent loss results in thirst, irritability, nausea, and weakness."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" 15 • A 10-percent loss results in dizziness, headache, in ability to walk, and a ti ngling sensation in the limbs. • A 15-percent loss results in dim vision, painful urination, swollen tongue , deafness, and a numb feeling in the skin. • A loss greater than 15 percent may result in death. 4-4. The most common signs and symptoms of dehydration are— • Dark urine with a very strong odor. • Low urine output. • Dark, sunken eyes. • Fatigue. • Emotional instability. • Loss of skin elasticity. • Delayed capillary refill in fingernail beds. • Trench line down center of tongue. • Thirst. (Last on the list because you are alr eady 2-percent dehydrated by the time you crave fluids.) 4-5. You should replace the water as you lose it. Trying to make up a deficit is difficult in a survival situation, and thirst is not a sign of how much water you need. 4-6. Most people cannot comfortably dri nk more than 1 liter of water at a time. So, even when not thirsty, drink small amounts of water at regular intervals each hour to prevent dehydration. 4-7. If you are under physical and mental stress or subject to severe conditions, increase your water intake. Drink enough liquids to maintain a urin e output of at least 0.5 liters every 24 hours. 4-8. In any situation where food intake is low, drink 6 to 8 liters of water per da y. In an extreme climate, especially an arid one, the average pe rson can lose 2.5 to 3.5 liters of water per hour . In this type of climate, you should drink 8 to 12 ounces of water ever y 30 minutes. It is better to regulate water loss through work or rest cycles because overhydration can occur if water intake exceed 1 1/2 quarts per hour. Overhydration can cause low serum sodium levels resu lting in cerebral and pulmonary edema, which can lead to death. 4-9. With the loss of water there is also a loss of el ectrolytes (body salts). The average diet can usually keep up with these losses but in an extreme situation or illness, additional sour ces need to be provided. You should maintain an intake of carbohydr ates and other necessary electrolytes. 4-10. Of all the physical problems en countered in a survival situati on, the loss of water is the most preventable. The following are basic guideli nes for the prevention of dehydration: • Always drink water when eating. Water is used and consumed as a part of the digestion process and can lead to dehydration. • Acclimatize. The body performs more efficiently in extreme conditions when acclimatized. • Conserve sweat, not water. Limit sweat-producing activ ities but drink water. • Ration water. Until you find a suitable source, ration your sweat, not your water. Limit activity and heat gain or loss."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 16 4-11. You can estimate fluid loss by several means. A field dressing holds about 0.25 liters (1/4 canteen) of fluid. A soaked T-shirt holds 0.5 to 0.75 liters. 4-12. You can also use the pulse and breathing rate to estimate fluid loss. Use the following as a guide: • With a 0.75-liter loss the wrist pulse rate will be under 100 beats per minute and the breathing rate 12 to 20 breaths per minute. • With a 0.75- to 1.5-liter loss the pulse rate will be 100 to 120 beats per minute and 20 to 30 breaths per minute. • With a 1.5- to 2-liter loss the pulse rate will be 120 to 140 beats per minute and 30 to 40 breaths per minute. Vital signs above these rates require more advanced care. FOOD 4-13. Although you can live several weeks without food, you need an ad equate amount to stay healthy. Without food your mental and physical capabilities will deteriorate rapidly and you will become weak. Food provides energy and replenis hes the substances that your body burns. Food provides vitamins, minerals, salts, and other elements essential to good health. Possibly more important, it helps morale. 4-14. The three basic sources of food are plants, animals (including fish), and issued rations. In varying degrees, both provide the calorie s, carbohydrates, fats, and proteins needed for normal daily body functions. You should use rations to augment plant and animal foods, which will extend and help maintain a balanced diet. 4-15. Calories are a measure of h eat and potential energy. The averag e person needs 2,000 calories per day to function at a minimum level. An adequate am ount of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins without an adequate caloric intake will lead to starvation and ca nnibalism of the body's own tissue for energy. Plants 4-16. Plant foods provide carbohydrates—the main source of energy. Many plants provide enough protein to keep the body at normal efficienc y. Although plants may not provide a balanced diet, they will sustain you even in the arctic, where meat's heat-produci ng qualities are normally esse ntial. Many plant foods such as nuts and seeds will give you enough protein and oils for normal efficiency. Roots, green vegetables, and plant foods containing natural sugar will provide calories and carbohydrates that give the body natural energy. 4-17. The food value of plants beco mes more and more important if you are eluding the enemy or if you are in an area where wildlife is scarce. For instance— • You can dry plants by wind, air, sun, or fire. This retards spoilage so th at you can store or carry the plant food with you to use when needed. • You can obtain plants more easily and more quietly than meat. This is extremely important when the enemy is near. Animals 4-18. Meat is more nourishing than plant food. In fact , it may even be more readily available in some places. However, to get meat, you need to know the ha bits of and how to capture the various wildlife."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 17 4-19. To satisfy your immediate food needs, first seek the more abundant and more easily obtained wildlife, such as insects, crusta ceans, mollusks, fish, and reptiles . These can satisfy your immediate hunger while you are preparing traps and snares for larger game. PERSONAL HYGIENE 4-20. In any situation, cleanliness is an important factor in preventing infection and disease. It becomes even more important in a survival situation. Poor hygiene can reduce you r chances of survival. 4-21. A daily shower with hot water and soap is ideal , but you can stay clean w ithout this luxury. Use a cloth and soapy water to wash yourse lf. Pay special attenti on to the feet, armpits, crotch, hands, and hair as these are prime areas for infesta tion and infection. If water is scarce , take an \"air\" bath. Remove as much of your clothing as practical and expose your body to the sun and ai r for at least 1 hour. Be careful not to sunburn. 4-22. If you don't have soap, use ashes or sand, or make soap from animal fat and wood ashes if your situation allows. To make soap— • Extract grease from animal fat by cutting the fat into small pieces and cooking it in a pot. • Add enough water to the pot to keep the fat from sticking as it cooks. • Cook the fat slowly, stirring frequently. • After the fat is rendered, pour the gr ease into a container to harden. • Place ashes in a container with a spout near the bottom. • Pour water over the ashes and collect the liquid that drips out of the spout in a separate container. This liquid is the potash or lye. 4-23. Another way to get the lye is to pour the slurry (the mixture of ashes and water) through a straining cloth. • In a cooking pot, mix two parts grease to one part lye. • Place this mixture over a fire and boil it until it thickens. After the mixture (the soap) cools, you can use it in the semiliquid state directly from the pot. You can also pour it into a pan, allow it to harden, and cut it into ba rs for later use. Keep Your Hands Clean 4-24. Germs on your hands can infect food and wounds. Wash your hands after handling any material that is likely to carry germs, after urinating or defecati ng, after caring for the sick, and before handling any food, food utensils, or drinking water. Keep your finge rnails closely trimmed and clean, and keep your fingers out of your mouth. Keep Your Hair Clean 4-25. Your hair can become a haven for bacteria or fleas, lice, and ot her parasites. Keeping your hair clean, combed, and trimmed helps you avoid this danger. Keep Your Clothing Clean"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" 18 4-26. Keep your clothing and bedding as clean as possi ble to reduce the chances of skin infection or parasitic infestation. Clean your out er clothing whenever it becomes soiled. Wear clean underclothing and socks each day. If water is scarce, \"air\" clean your clothing by shaking, airing, and sunning it for 2 hours. If you are using a sleeping bag, turn it inside out after each use, fluff it, and air it. Keep Your Teeth Clean 4-27. Thoroughly clean your mouth and teeth with a toothbrush at least once each day. If you don't have a toothbrush, make a chewing stick. Fi nd a twig about 20 centimeters (cm) (8 inches) long and 1 centimeter (1/3 inch) wide. Chew one end of the stick to se parate the fibers. Then brush your teeth thoroughly. Another way is to wrap a clean stri p of cloth around your fingers and rub your teeth with it to wipe away food particles. You can also brush yo ur teeth with small amounts of sa nd, baking soda, salt, or soap. Rinse your mouth with water, salt water, or willow bark tea. Also, flossing your teeth w ith string or fiber helps oral hygiene. 4-28. If you have cavities, you can make temporary fillings by placing candle wax, tobacco, hot pepper, toothpaste or powder, or portions of a gingerroot into the cavity. Ma ke sure you clean the cavity by rinsing or picking the particles out of the cavity before placing a filling in the cavity. Take Care of Your Feet 4-29. To prevent serious foot problems, break in your shoes before wearing them on any mission. Wash and massage your feet daily. Trim your toenails straight across. Wear an insole and the proper size of dry socks. Powder and check your feet daily for blisters. 4-30. If you get a small blister, do not open it. An inta ct blister is safe from infection. Apply a padding material around the blister to relieve pressure and reduce friction. If the blister bursts, treat it as an open wound. Clean and dress it daily and pa d around it. Leave large blisters in tact. To avoid having the blister burst or tear under pressure and cause a painful and open sore, do the following: • Obtain a sewing-type needle a nd a clean or sterilized thread. • Run the needle and thread through the blister after clean ing the blister. • Detach the needle and leave both ends of the thre ad hanging out of the blis ter. The thread will absorb the liquid inside. This reduces the size of the hole and ensu res that the hole does not close up. • Pad around the blister. Get Sufficient Rest 4-31. You need a certain amount of rest to keep going. Plan for regular rest peri ods of at least 10 minutes per hour during your daily activities. Learn to make yourself comforta ble under less-than-ideal conditions. A change from mental to physical ac tivity or vice versa can be refreshi ng when time or situation does not permit total relaxation. Keep Campsite Clean 4-32. Do not soil the ground in the campsite area with urine or feces. Use latrines, if available. When latrines are not available, dig \"cat holes\" and cover the waste. Colle ct drinking water upstream from the campsite. Purify all water."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" 19 MEDICAL EMERGENCIES 4-33. Medical problems and emergencies you may face include breathing problems, severe bleeding, and shock. The following paragraphs explain each of these problems and what you can expect if they occur. BREATHING PROBLEMS 4-34. Any one of the following can cause airway obstruction, resulting in stopped breathing: • Foreign matter in mouth of throat that obstructs the opening to the trachea. • Face or neck injuries. • Inflammation and swelling of mouth and throat caused by inhaling smoke, flames, and irritating vapors or by an allergic reaction. • \"Kink\" in the throat (caused by the neck bent forward so that the chin rests upon the chest). • Tongue blocks passage of air to the lungs upon unconsciousness. When an individual is unconscious, the muscles of the lower jaw and tongue relax as the neck drops forward, causing the lower jaw to sag and the tongue to drop back and block the passage of air. SEVERE BLEEDING 4-35. Severe bleeding from any major blood vessel in th e body is extremely dangerous. The loss of 1 liter of blood will produce moderate symptoms of shock. The loss of 2 liters will produ ce a severe state of shock that places the body in extreme danger. The loss of 3 liters is usually fatal. SHOCK 4-36. Shock (acute stress reaction) is not a disease in itself. It is a clinical condition characterized by symptoms that arise when cardiac output is insufficient to fill the arteries with blood under enough pressure to provide an adequate bl ood supply to the organs and tissues. LIFESAVING STEPS 4-37. Control panic, both your own and the victim's. Reassure him and try to keep him quiet. Perform a rapid physical exam. Look for the caus e of the injury and follow the AB Cs of first aid. Start with the airway and breathing, but be discerning. In some cas es, a person may die from arterial bleeding more quickly than from an airway obstruction. The foll owing paragraphs describe how to treat airway, bleeding, and shock emergencies. OPEN AIRWAY AND MAINTAIN 4-38. You can open an airway and mainta in it by using the following steps: • Step 1. You should check to see if the victim has a partial or complete airway obstruction. If he can cough or speak, allow him to clear the obstructi on naturally. Stand by, r eassure the victim, and be ready to clear his airway and perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation should he become unconscious. If his airway is completely obstr ucted, administer abdominal thrusts until the obstruction is cleared. • Step 2. Using a finger, quickly sweep the victim's m outh clear of any forei gn objects, broken teeth, dentures, and sand."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 20 • Step 3. Using the jaw thrust method, gr asp the angles of the victim's lower jaw and lift with both hands, one on each side, moving the jaw forward. For stability, rest your elbows on the surface on which the victim is lying. If his lips are clos ed, gently open the lowe r lip with your thumb ( Figure 4-1 ). Figure 4-1. Jaw Thrust Method • Step 4. With the victim's airway open, pinch his no se closed with your thumb and forefinger and blow two complete breaths into his lungs. Allow th e lungs to deflate after the second inflation and perform the following:  Look for his chest to rise and fall.  Listen for escaping air during exhalation.  Feel for flow of air on your cheek. • Step 5. If the forced breaths do not stimulate spontaneous breathing, maintain the victim's breathing by performing m outh-to-mouth resuscitation. • Step 6. There is danger of the victim vomiting du ring mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Check the victim's mouth periodically fo r vomit and clear as needed. NOTE: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (C PR) may be necessary after clea ning the airway, but only after major bleeding is under control. See FM 21-20, Physical Fitness Training , the American Heart Association manual, the Red Cross manual, or most other first aid books for detail ed instructions on CPR. CONTROL BLEEDING 4-39. In a survival situation, you must control seri ous bleeding immediately because replacement fluids normally are not available and the victim can die with in a matter of minutes. External bleeding falls into the following classifications (according to its source): • Arterial. Blood vessels called arteries carry blood away from the heart and through the body. A cut artery issues bright red blood from the wound in distinct spurts or pulses that correspond to the rhythm of the heartbeat. Because the blood in the arteries is unde r high pressure, an individual can lose a large volume of blood in a short period when damage to an artery of significant size occurs. Therefore, arterial bleeding is the most serious ty pe of bleeding. If not controlled promptly, it can be fatal. • Venous . Venous blood is blood that is returning to the heart through blood vessels called veins. A steady flow of dark red, maroon, or bluish blood characterizes bleeding from a vein. You can usually control venous bleeding more easily than arterial bleeding."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" 21 • Capillary. The capillaries are the extremely small vessels that connect the arteries with the veins. Capillary bleeding most commonly occurs in minor cu ts and scrapes. This type of bleeding is not difficult to control. 4-40. You can control external bleeding by direct pressu re, indirect (pressure points) pressure, elevation, digital ligation, or tourniquet. E ach method is explained below. Direct Pressure 4-41. The most effective way to control external bleeding is by applying pressu re directly over the wound. This pressure must not only be firm enough to stop the bleeding, but it must also be maintained long enough to \"seal off\" the damaged surface. 4-42. If bleeding continues after having applied direct pressure for 30 minutes, apply a pressure dressing. This dressing consists of a thick dressing of gauze or other suitable material applied directly over the wound and held in place with a tightly wrapped bandage ( Figure 4-2 ). It should be tighter than an ordinary compression bandage but not so tight that it impairs circulati on to the rest of the limb. Once you apply the dressing, do not remove it, even when the dressing becomes blood soaked. Figure 4-2. Application of a Pressure Dressing"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" 22 4-43. Leave the pressure dressing in place for 1 or 2 days, after which you can remove and replace it with a smaller dressing. In the long-term survival environm ent, make fresh, daily dressing changes and inspect for signs of infection. Elevation 4-44. Raising an injured extremity as high as possible above the hear t's level slows blood loss by aiding the return of blood to the heart and lowering the bl ood pressure at the wound. However, elevation alone will not control bleeding en tirely; you must also apply direct pressure over the wound. When treating a snakebite, be sure to keep the extremity lower than the heart. Pressure Points 4-45. A pressure point is a location wh ere the main artery to the wound lies near the surface of the skin or where the artery passes di rectly over a bony prominence ( Figure 4-3 ). You can use digital pressure on a pressure point to slow arterial bl eeding until the application of a pressure dressing. Pressure point control is not as effective for controlling bleeding as direct pressure exerted on the wound. It is rare when a single major compressible artery supplies a damaged vessel. Figure 4-3. Pressure Points 4-46. If you cannot remember the exact lo cation of the pressure points, foll ow this rule: Apply pressure at the end of the joint just above the injured area. On ha nds, feet, and head, this will be the wrist, ankle, and neck, respectively. WARNING Use caution when applying pressure to the neck. Too much pressure for too long may cause unconsciousness or death. Never place a tourniquet around the neck."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" 23 4-47. Maintain pressure points by placi ng a round stick in the joint, bending the jo int over the stick, and then keeping it tightly bent by lash ing. By using this method to maintain pressure, it frees your hands to work in other areas. Digital Ligation 4-48. You can stop major bleeding immedi ately or slow it down by applying pressure with a finger or two on the bleeding end of the vein or artery. Maintain the pressure until the bleeding stops or slows down enough to apply a pressure bandage, elevation, and so forth. Tourniquet 4-49. Use a tourniquet only when direct pressure ov er the bleeding point and all other methods did not control the bleeding. If you leave a to urniquet in place too long, the damage to the tissues can progress to gangrene, with a loss of the limb later. An improp erly applied tourniquet can also cause permanent damage to nerves and other tissues at the site of the constriction. If you must use a tourniquet, place it around the extremity, between the wound and the heart, 5 to 10 centimeters (2 to 4 inches) above the wound site. Never place it directly over the wound or a fracture. Figure 4-4 explains how to apply a tourniquet. Figure 4-4. Application of Tourniquet"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" 24 4-50. After you secure the tourniquet, clea n and bandage the wound. A lone survivor does not remove or release an applied tourniquet. However, in a buddy system, the buddy can release the tourniquet pressure every 10 to 15 minutes for 1 or 2 mi nutes to let blood flow to the rest of the extremity to prevent limb loss. PREVENT AND TREAT SHOCK 4-51. Anticipate shock in all injured personnel. Treat a ll injured persons as follows, regardless of what symptoms appear ( Figure 4-5 ): • If the victim is conscious, place him on a level su rface with the lower extremities elevated 15 to 20 centimeters (6 to 8 inches). • If the victim is unconscious, place him on his side or abdomen with his head turned to one side to prevent choking on vomit, blood, or other fluids. • If you are unsure of the best posi tion, place the victim perfectly flat . Once the victim is in a shock position, do not move him. • Maintain body heat by insulating the victim fr om the surroundings and, in some instances, applying external heat. • If wet, remove all the victim's wet clothing as soon as possible and replace with dry clothing. • Improvise a shelter to insulate the victim from the weather. • Use warm liquids or foods, a prewarmed sleeping bag, another person, warmed water in canteens, hot rocks wrapped in clothing, or fires on either si de of the victim to pr ovide external warmth. • If the victim is conscious, slow ly administer small doses of a warm salt or sugar solution, if available. • If the victim is unconscious or has abdo minal wounds, do not give fluids by mouth. • Have the victim rest for at least 24 hours. • If you are a lone survivor, lie in a depression in the ground, behind a tree, or any other place out of the weather, with your h ead lower than your feet. • If you are with a buddy, reasse ss your patient constantly."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" 25 Figure 4-5. Treatment for Shock BONE AND JOINT INJURY 4-52. You could face bone and joint injuries that include fractures, dislocations, and sprains. Follow the steps explained below for each injury. FRACTURES 4-53. There are basically two types of fractures: open and closed. W ith an open (or compound) fracture, the bone protrudes through the skin and complicat es the actual fracture with an open wound. Any bone protruding from the wound should be cleaned with an antiseptic and kept moist. You should splint the injured area and continually monitor blood flow past the injury. Only reposition the break if there is no blood flow. 4-54. The closed fracture has no open wounds. Follow the guidelines for immob ilization and splint the fracture. 4-55. The signs and symptoms of a fracture are pain, tenderness, discoloration, swelling deformity, loss of function, and grating (a sound or feeling that occurs when broken bone ends rub together)."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" 26 4-56. The dangers with a fracture are the severing or the compression of a nerve or blood vessel at the site of fracture. For this reason mini mum manipulation should be done, and only very cautiously. If you notice the area below the break becoming numb, swollen, cool to the touch, or turn ing pale, and the victim showing signs of shock, a major vessel may have been severed. You must contro l this internal bleeding. Reset the fracture and treat the victim for shock and replace lost fluids. 4-57. Often you must maintain tracti on during the splinting and healing pr ocess. You can effectively pull smaller bones such as the arm or lower leg by hand. You can create traction by wedging a hand or foot in the V-notch of a tree and pushing against the tree with the other extremity. You can then splint the break. 4-58. Very strong muscles hold a broken thighbone (f emur) in place making it difficult to maintain traction during healing. You can make an improvised traction sp lint using natural material ( Figure 4-6 ) as explained below. Figure 4-6. Improvised Traction Splint • Get two forked branches or saplings at least 5 centimeters (2 inches) in diameter. Measure one from the patient's armpit to 20 to 30 centimeters (8 to 12 inches) past his unbroken leg. Measure the other from the groin to 20 to 30 centimeters (8 to 12 inches) past the unbroken leg. Ensure that both extend an equal distance beyond the end of the leg. • Pad the two splints. Notch the ends without forks and lash a 20- to 30-centimeter (8- to 12-inch) cross member made from a 5-centimeter (2 -inch) diameter branch between them. • Using available material (vines, cloth, rawhid e), tie the splint around th e upper portion of the body and down the length of the broken le g. Follow the splinting guidelines. • With available material, fashion a wrap that will extend around the ankle, with the two free ends tied to the cross member. • Place a 10- by 2.5-centimeter (4- by 1-inch) stick in the middle of the free ends of the ankle wrap between the cross member and the foot. Using the stick, twist the material to make the traction easier. • Continue twisting until the broken leg is as long or slightly longe r than the unbroken leg. • Lash the stick to maintain traction. NOTE: Over time, you may lose traction because the mate rial weakened. Check the traction periodically. If you must change or repair the splint, ma intain the traction manually for a short time."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" 27 DISLOCATIONS 4-59. Dislocations are the separatio ns of bone joints causing the bones to go out of proper alignment. These misalignments can be extremely painful and can cause an impairment of nerve or circulatory function below the area affected. You mu st place these joints back into alignment as quickly as possible. 4-60. Signs and symptoms of dislocations are joint pain, tenderness, swelling, discoloration, limited range of motion, and deformity of the joint. You trea t dislocations by reduction, immobilization, and rehabilitation. 4-61. Reduction or \"setting\" is placing the bones back into their proper alignm ent. You can use several methods, but manual traction or the use of weights to pull the bones are the sa fest and easiest. Once performed, reduction decreases the victim's pain and allows for normal function and circulation. Without an X ray, you can judge proper alignment by the look and feel of the joint and by comparing it to the joint on the opposite side. 4-62. Immobilization is nothing more than splinting the dislocation afte r reduction. You can use any field- expedient material for a splint or you can splint an extremity to the body. The basic guidelines for splinting are as follows: • Splint above and below the fracture site. • Pad splints to reduce discomfort. • Check circulation below the fracture after making each tie on the splint. 4-63 To rehabilitate the di slocation, remove the splints after 7 to 14 days. Gradually use the injured joint until fully healed. SPRAINS 4-64. The accidental overstretching of a tendon or ligament causes sprains. The signs and symptoms are pain, swelling, tenderness, and di scoloration (black and blue). 4-65. When treating sprains, you should follow the letters in RICE as defined below: • R-Rest injured area. • I-Ice for 24 to 48 hours. • C-Compression-wrap or splint to help stabilize. If possible, le ave the boot on a sprained ankle unless circulation is compromised. • E-Elevate the affected area. NOTE: Ice is preferred for a sprain but cold spring water may be more easily obtained in a survival situation. BITES AND STINGS 4-66. Insects and related pests are haza rds in a survival situation. They not only cause irritations, but they are often carriers of diseases that cause severe allerg ic reactions in some indivi duals. In many parts of the world you will be exposed to serious, even fatal, diseases not encountered in the United States."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" 28 • Ticks can carry and transmit diseases, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever common in many parts of the United States. Ticks also transmit Lyme disease. • Mosquitoes may carry malaria, dengue, and many other diseases. • Flies can spread disease from contact with in fectious sources. They are causes of sleeping sickness, typhoid, cholera, and dysentery. • Fleas can transmit plague. • Lice can transmit typhus and relapsing fever. 4-67. The best way to avoid the complications of in sect bites and stings is to keep immunizations (including booster shots) up-to-date, avoid insect-infested areas, use nett ing and insect repellent, and wear all clothing properly. 4-68. If you are bitten or stung, do not sc ratch the bite or sting; it might become infected. Inspect your body at least once a day to ensure there are no insect s attached to you. If you find ticks attached to your body, cover them with a substance (such as petroleum je lly, heavy oil, or tree sap) that will cut off their air supply. Without air, the tick re leases its hold, and you can remove it. Take care to remove the whole tick. Use tweezers if you have them. Grasp the tick wher e the mouthparts are attach ed to the skin. Do not squeeze the tick's body. Wash your hands after touching the tick. Clean the tick wound daily until healed. TREATMENT 4-69. It is impossible to list the trea tment of all the different types of bites and stings. However, you can generally treat bites and stings as follows: • If antibiotics are available for your use, become familiar with them before deployment and use them. • Predeployment immunizations can prevent most of the common diseases carried by mosquitoes and some carried by flies. • The common fly-borne diseases are usually tr eatable with penicillins or erythromycin. • Most tick-, flea-, louse-, and mite-borne diseases are treatabl e with tetracycline. • Most antibiotics come in 250 milligram (mg) or 500 mg tablets. If you cannot remember the exact dose rate to treat a disease, 2 tablets, 4 times a da y, for 10 to 14 days will us ually kill any bacteria. BEE AND WASP STINGS 4-70. If stung by a bee, immediately remove the stinge r and venom sac, if attached, by scraping with a fingernail or a knife blade. Do not squeeze or grasp the stinger or venom sac, as squeezing will force more venom into the wound. Wash the sting site thoroughl y with soap and water to lessen the chance of a secondary infection. 4-71. If you know or suspect that you are allergic to insect stings, always carry an insect sting kit with you. 4-72. Relieve the itching and discomfo rt caused by insect bites by applying— • Cold compresses. • A cooling paste of mud and ashes. • Sap from dandelions. • Coconut meat."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" 29 • Crushed cloves of garlic. • Onion. SPIDER BITES AND SCORPION STINGS 4-73. The black widow spider is id entified by a red hourglass on its abdomen. Only the female bites, and it has a neurotoxic venom. The initial pain is not severe, but severe loca l pain rapidly develops. The pain gradually spreads over the entire body and settles in th e abdomen and legs. Abdominal cramps and progressive nausea, vomiting, and a rash may occur. Weakness, tremors, sweating, and salivation may occur. Anaphylactic reactions can occu r. Symptoms may worsen for the next three days and then begin to subside for the next week. Treat for shock. Be ready to perform CPR. Clean and dress the bite area to reduce the risk of infection. An antivenin is available. 4-74. The funnelweb spider is a la rge brown or gray spider found in Australia. The symptoms and the treatment for its bite are as for the black widow spider. 4-75. The brown house spider or brown recluse spider is a small, light brown spider identified by a dark brown violin on its back. There is no pain, or so little pain, that usually a victim is not aware of the bite. Within a few hours a painful red area with a mottled cyanotic center appears. Necrosis does not occur in all bites, but usually in 3 to 4 days , a star-shaped, firm area of deep purpl e discoloration appears at the bite site. The area turns dark and mummified in a week or two. The margins separate and the scab falls off, leaving an open ulcer. Secondary infection and regional swollen lymph glands usually become visible at this stage. The outstanding characteristic of the brow n recluse bite is an ulce r that does not heal but persists for weeks or months. In addi tion to the ulcer, there is often a sy stemic reaction that is serious and may lead to death. Reactions (fever, chills, joint pain, vomiting, and a ge neralized rash) occur chiefly in children or debilitated persons. 4-76. Tarantulas are large, hairy sp iders found mainly in the tropics. Mo st do not inject venom, but some South American species do. They have large fangs. If bitten, pain and bleeding are certain, and infection is likely. Treat a tarantula bite as for any open wound, and try to prevent inf ection. If symptoms of poisoning appear, treat as for the bite of the black widow spider. 4-77. Scorpions are all poisonous to a greater or lesser degree. There are two different reactions, depending on the species: • Severe local reaction only, with pain and swelling around the area of the sting. Possible prickly sensation around the mouth a nd a thick-feeling tongue. • Severe systemic reaction, with little or no vi sible local reaction. Local pain may be present. Systemic reaction includes resp iratory difficulties, thick-feel ing tongue, body spasms, drooling, gastric distention, double vision, blindness, invo luntary rapid movement of the eyeballs, involuntary urination and defecation, and heart failure. Death is rare, occurring mainly in children and adults with high blood pressure or illnesses. 4-78. Treat scorpion stings as you would a black widow bite. SNAKEBITES 4-79. The chance of a snakebite in a survival situation is rather small, if you are familiar with the various types of snakes and their habitats. However, it could happen and you shoul d know how to treat a"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" 30 snakebite. Deaths from snakebites are rare. More than one-half of the snakebite victims have little or no poisoning, and only about one-quarter develop serious systemic poisoning. However, the chance of a snakebite in a survival situation can affect morale, a nd failure to take preventive measures or failure to treat a snakebite properly can result in needless tragedy. 4-80. The primary concern in the tr eatment of snakebite is to lim it the amount of eventual tissue destruction around the bite area. 4-81. A bite wound, regardless of the type of animal that inflicted it, can become infected from bacteria in the animal's mouth. With nonpoisonous as well as poisonous snakebites, this local infection is responsible for a large part of the re sidual damage that results. 4-82. Snake venoms not only contain pois ons that attack the victim's centr al nervous system (neurotoxins) and blood circulation (hemotoxins), bu t also digestive enzymes (cytotoxins ) to aid in digesting their prey. These poisons can cause a very large area of tissu e death, leaving a large open wound. This condition could lead to the need for even tual amputation if not treated. 4-83. Shock and panic in a person bitten by a snake can also affect the person's recovery. Excitement, hysteria, and panic can speed up th e circulation, causing the body to abso rb the toxin quickly. Signs of shock occur within the firs t 30 minutes after the bite. 4-84. Before you start treating a snakebite, determin e whether the snake was poisonous or nonpoisonous. Bites from a nonpoisonous snake will show rows of t eeth. Bites from a poisonous snake may have rows of teeth showing, but will have one or more dist inctive puncture marks caused by fang penetration. Symptoms of a poisonous bite may be spontaneous bl eeding from the nose and a nus, blood in the urine, pain at the site of the bite, and swelling at the site of the bite within a few minutes or up to 2 hours later. 4-85. Breathing difficulty, paralysis, weakness, twitching, and numbness are also signs of neurotoxic venoms. These signs usually appear 1.5 to 2 hours after the bite. 4-86. If you determine that a poisonous snake bi t an individual, take the following steps: • Reassure the victim and keep him still. • Set up for shock and force fluids or give by intravenous (IV) means. • Remove watches, rings, bracelets , or other constricting items. • Clean the bite area. • Maintain an airway (especially if bitten near the face or neck) and be prepared to administer mouth-to-mouth resuscitation or CPR. • Use a constricting band between the wound and the heart. • Immobilize the site. • Remove the poison as soon as possible by using a mechanical suction device. Do not squeeze the site of the bite. 4-87. You should also remember four very important guidelines during the treatment of snakebites. Do not — • Give the victim alcoholic beverages or tobacco products. Never give atropi ne! Give morphine or other central nervous system (CNS) depressors."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" 31 • Make any deep cuts at the bite site. Cutting opens capillaries that in turn open a direct route into the blood stream for venom and infection. NOTE: If medical treatment is over 1 hour away, make an incision ( no longer than 6 millimeters [1/4 inch] and no deeper than 3 millimeters [1/8 inch]) over each puncture, cutting just deep enough to enlarge the fang opening, but only through the fi rst or second layer of skin. Place a suction cup over the bite so that you have a good vacuum seal. Suction the bite site 3 to 4 times. Suction for a MINIMUM of 30 MINUTES. Use mouth suction only as a last resort and only if you do not have open sores in your mouth. Spit the envenomed blood out and rinse your mout h with water. This method will draw out 25 to 30 percent of the venom. • Put your hands on your face or rub your eyes, as venom may be on your hands. Venom may cause blindness. • Break open the large blisters that form around the bite site. 4-88. After caring for the victim as described above, take the following actions to minimize local effects: • If infection appears, keep the wound open and clean. • Use heat after 24 to 48 hours to he lp prevent the spread of local in fection. Heat also helps to draw out an infection. • Keep the wound covered with a dry, sterile dressing. • Have the victim drink large amounts of fluids until the infection is gone. WOUNDS 4-89. An interruption of the skin's integrity char acterizes wounds. These wounds could be open wounds, skin diseases, frostbite, trench foot, or burns. OPEN WOUNDS 4-90. Open wounds are serious in a survival situation, not only because of tissue damage and blood loss, but also because they may become infected. Ba cteria on the object that made the wound, on the individual's skin and clothing, or on other foreign material or dirt that touches the wound may cause infection. 4-91. By taking proper care of the wound you can re duce further contamination and promote healing. Clean the wound as soon as possible after it occurs by— • Removing or cutting clothing away from the wound. • Always looking for an exit wound if a sharp obj ect, gunshot, or projectile caused a wound. • Thoroughly cleaning the skin around the wound. • Rinsing (not scrubbing) the wound with large am ounts of water under pressure. You can use fresh urine if water is not available. 4-92. The \"open treatment\" method is the safest way to manage wounds in survival situations. Do not try to close any wound by suturing or si milar procedures. Leave the wound ope n to allow the drainage of any pus resulting from infection. As long as the wound can drain, it generally will not become life- threatening, regardless of how unpleasant it looks or smells."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" 32 4-93. Cover the wound with a clean dr essing. Place a bandage on the dressing to hold it in place. Change the dressing daily to check for infection. 4-94. If a wound is gaping, you can bri ng the edges together with adhesi ve tape cut in the form of a \"butterfly\" or \"dumbbell\" ( Figure 4-7 ). Use this method with extreme caution in the absence of antibiotics. You must always allow for prope r drainage of the wound to avoid infection. Figure 4-7. Butterfly Closure 4-95. In a survival situation, some degree of wound in fection is almost inevitable. Pain, swelling, and redness around the wound, increased temperature, a nd pus in the wound or on the dressing indicate infection is present. 4-96. If the wound becomes infecte d, you should treat as follows: • Place a warm, moist compress directly on the inf ected wound. Change the compress when it cools, keeping a warm compress on the wound for a total of 30 minutes. Apply the compresses three or four times daily. • Drain the wound. Open and gently probe the infected wound with a sterile instrument. • Dress and bandage the wound. • Drink a lot of water. • In the event of gunshot or other serious wounds, it may be better to rinse the wound out vigorously every day with the cleanest water available. If drinking water or methods to purify drinking water are limited, do not use your drinking water. Flush the wound forcefully daily until the wound is healed over. Your scar may be larger but your chances of infecti on are greatly reduced. • Continue this treatment daily until all signs of infection have disappeared. 4-97. If you do not have antibiotics and the wound has become severely infected, does not heal, and ordinary debridement is impossible, consider maggot therapy as stated below, despite its hazards: • Expose the wound to flies for one day and then cover it. • Check daily for maggots. • Once maggots develop, keep wound covered but check daily. • Remove all maggots when they have cleaned out a ll dead tissue and before they start on healthy tissue. Increased pain and bri ght red blood in the wound indicate that the maggots have reached healthy tissue. • Flush the wound repeatedly with sterile wate r or fresh urine to remove the maggots."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" 33 • Check the wound every 4 hours for several days to ensure all maggots have been removed. • Bandage the wound and treat it as any other wound. It should heal normally. SKIN DISEASES AND AILMENTS 4-98. Boils, fungal infections, and rashes rarely de velop into a serious health problem. They cause discomfort and you should treat them as follows: Boils 4-99. Apply warm compresses to bring the boil to a head. Another method that can be used to bring a boil to a head is the bottle suction method. Use an empty bottle that has been bo iled in water. Place the opening of the bottle over the boil a nd seal the skin forming an airtight environment that will create a vacuum. This method will draw the pus to the skin surface when applied correctly. Then open the boil using a sterile knife, wire, needle, or similar item. Thoroughly clean out the pus using soap and water. Cover the boil site, checking it periodically to ensure no further infection develops. Fungal Infections 4-100. Keep the skin clean and dry, and expose the in fected area to as much sunlight as possible. Do not scratch the affected area. During the S outheast Asian conflict, soldiers used antifungal powders, lye soap, chlorine bleach, alcohol, vinegar, concentrated salt water, and iodine to treat fungal infections with varying degrees of success. As with any \"unorthodox\" method of treatment, use these with caution . Rashes 4-101. To treat a skin rash effectiv ely, first determine what is causi ng it. This determination may be difficult even in the best of situations. Observe the following rules to treat rashes: • If it is moist, keep it dry. • If it is dry, keep it moist. • Do not scratch it. 4-102. Use a compress of vinegar or tannic acid derived from tea or from boiling acorns or the bark of a hardwood tree to dry weeping rashes. Keep dry ra shes moist by rubbing a small amount of rendered animal fat or grease on the affected area. 4-103. Remember, treat rashes as open wounds; clean and dress them daily. There are many substances available to survivors in the wild or in captivity for use as antiseptics to treat wounds. Follow the recommended guidance below: • Iodine tablets. Use 5 to 15 tablets in a liter of wa ter to produce a good rinse for wounds during healing. • Garlic. Rub it on a wound or boil it to ex tract the oils and use the water to rinse the affected area. • Salt water. Use 2 to 3 tablespoons per lite r of water to kill bacteria. • Bee honey. Use it straight or dissolved in water. • Sphagnum moss. Found in boggy areas worldwide, it is a natural source of iodine. Use as a dressing."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" 34 • Sugar. Place directly on wound and remove thor oughly when it turns into a glazed and runny substance. Then reapply. • Syrup. In extreme circumstances, some of the same benefits of honey and sugar can be realized with any high-sugar-content item. NOTE: Again, use noncommercially prep ared materials with caution. BURNS 4-104. The following field treatment for burns relieves the pain somewhat, seems to help speed healing, and offers some protection against infection: • First, stop the burning process. Put out the fire by removing clothing, dousing with water or sand, or by rolling on the ground. Cool the burning skin with ice or water. For burns caused by white phosphorous, pick out the white phosphorous with tweezers; do not douse with water. • Soak dressings or clean rags for 10 minutes in a boiling tannic acid solutio n (obtained from tea, inner bark of hardwood trees, or acorns boiled in water). • Cool the dressings or clean rags and apply over burns. Sugar and honey also work for burns with honey being especially effective at promoting ne w skin growth and stopping infections. Use both as you would in an open wound above. • Treat as an open wound. • Replace fluid loss. Fluid replacement can be achi eved through oral (preferred) and intravenous routes (when resources are av ailable). One alternate method through which rehydration can be achieved is through the rectal rout e. Fluids do not need to be st erile, only purified. A person can effectively absorb approximately 1 to 1.5 liters per hour by using a tube to deliver fluids into the rectal vault. • Maintain airway. • Treat for shock. • Consider using morphine, unless the burns are near the face. ENVIRONMENTAL INJURIES 4-105. Heatstroke, hypothermia, diarrhea, and intestin al parasites are environm ental injuries you could face in a survival situation. Read a nd follow the guidance provided below. HEATSTROKE 4-106. The breakdown of the body's heat regulatory sy stem (body temperature more than 40.5 degrees C [105 degrees F]) causes a heatstroke. Other heat injuries, such as cr amps or dehydration, do not always precede a heatstroke. Signs and symptoms of heatstroke are— • Swollen, beet-red face. • Reddened whites of eyes. • Victim not sweating. • Unconsciousness or delirium, which can cause pallor, a bluish color to lips and nail beds (cyanosis), and cool skin. NOTE: By this time, the victim is in severe shock. C ool the victim as rapidly as possible. Cool him by dipping him in a cool stream. If one is not available, douse the victim w ith urine, water, or at the very"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" 35 least, apply cool wet compresses to all the joints, esp ecially the neck, armpits, and crotch. Be sure to wet the victim's head. Heat loss through the scalp is great. Administer IVs and pr ovide drinking fluids. You may fan the individual. 4-107. You can expect the followi ng symptoms during cooling: • Vomiting. • Diarrhea. • Struggling. • Shivering. • Shouting. • Prolonged unconsciousness. • Rebound heatstroke within 48 hours. • Cardiac arrest; be r eady to perform CPR. NOTE: Treat for dehydration with lightly salted water. CHILBLAINS 4-108. Frostnip begins as firm, cold and white or gr ay areas on the face, ears, and extremities that can blister or peel just like sunburn as late as 2 to 3 days after the injury. Frostnip, or chilblains as it is sometimes called, is the result of tissue exposure to freezing temperatures and is the beginning of frostbite. The water in and around the cells freezes, rupturing cell wa lls and thus damaging the tissue. Warming the affected area with hands or a warm object treats this injury. Wind chill plays a factor in this injury; preventative measures in clude layers of dry clothing and protection against wetness and wind. TRENCH FOOT 4-109. Immersion or trench foot results from many hour s or days of exposure to wet or damp conditions at a temperature just above freezing. The nerves and muscles sustain the main damage, but gangrene can occur. In extreme cases the flesh dies and it may beco me necessary to have the foot or leg amputated. The best prevention is to keep your feet dry. Carry extra socks with you in a waterproof packet. Dry wet socks against your body. Wash your feet daily and put on dry socks. FROSTBITE 4-110. This injury results from fro zen tissues. Frostbite extends to a depth below the skin. The tissues become solid and immovable. Your feet, hands, and e xposed facial areas are pa rticularly vulnerable to frostbite. 4-111. When with others, prevent frostbite by usi ng the buddy system. Check your buddy's face often and make sure that he checks yours. If you are alone, peri odically cover your nose and lower part of your face with your mittens. 4-112. Do not try to thaw the affected areas by placi ng them close to an open flame. Frostbitten tissue may be immersed in 37 to 42 degrees C (99 to 109 de grees F) water until thawed. (Water temperature can be determined with the inside wris t or baby formula method.) Dry the part and place it next to your skin to warm it at body temperature."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" 36 HYPOTHERMIA 4-113. It is defined as the body's failure to maintain an inner core temperature of 36 degrees C (97 degrees F). Exposure to cool or cold temperature over a short or long time can cause hypothermia. Dehydration and lack of food and rest predispose the survivor to hypothermia. 4-114. Immediate treatment is the key. Move the victim to the best shelter possible away from the wind, rain, and cold. Remove all wet clothe s and get the victim into dry clothi ng. Replace lost fluids with warm fluids, and warm him in a sleeping bag using two people (if possible) pr oviding skin-to-skin contact. If the victim is unable to drink warm fl uids, rectal rehydrat ion may be used. DIARRHEA 4-115. A common, debilitating ailment caused by changi ng water and food, drinking contaminated water, eating spoiled food, becoming fatigue d, and using dirty dishes. You can avoid most of these causes by practicing preventive medicine. Howeve r, if you get diarrhea and do not have antidiarrheal medicine, one of the following treatments may be effective: • Limit your intake of fluids for 24 hours. • Drink one cup of a strong tea solution every 2 ho urs until the diarrhea sl ows or stops. The tannic acid in the tea helps to control the diarrhea. Boil the inner bark of a hardwood tree for 2 hours or more to release the tannic acid. • Make a solution of one handful of ground chalk, char coal, or dried bones and treated water. If you have some apple pomace or the rinds of citrus frui t, add an equal portion to the mixture to make it more effective. Take 2 tablespoons of the solution every 2 hours until the di arrhea slows or stops. INTESTINAL PARASITES 4-116. You can usually avoid worm in festations and other intestinal parasites if you take preventive measures. For example, never go barefoot. The most e ffective way to prevent intestinal parasites is to avoid uncooked meat, never eat raw vegetables cont aminated by raw sewage, and try not to use human waste as a fertilizer. However, should you become infested and lack proper medicine, you can use home remedies. Keep in mind that these home remedies wo rk on the principle of changing the environment of the gastrointestinal tract. The follo wing are home remedies you could use: • Salt water. Dissolve 4 tablespoons of salt in 1 liter of water and drink. Do not repeat this treatment. • Tobacco. Eat 1 to 1 1/2 cigarettes or approximately 1 teaspoon (pinch) of smokeless tobacco. The nicotine in the tobacco will kill or stun the worm s long enough for your system to pass them. If the infestation is severe, repeat the treatment in 24 to 48 hours, but no sooner . • Kerosene. Drink 2 tablespoons of kerosene, but no more . If necessary, you can repeat this treatment in 24 to 48 hours. Be careful not to i nhale the fumes. They may cause lung irritation. NOTE: Tobacco and kerosene treatment techniques are very dangerous, be careful. • Hot peppers. Peppers are effective only if they are a steady part of your diet. You can eat them raw or put them in soups or rice and meat dishes. They create an environmen t that is prohibitive to parasitic attachment. • Garlic. Chop or crush 4 cloves, mix with 1 glass of liquid, and drink daily for 3 weeks."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" 37 HERBAL MEDICINES 4-117. Our modern wonder drugs, laboratories, and equipment have obscured more primitive types of medicine involving determination, common sense, and a few simple treatments. However, in many areas of the world the people still depend on local \"witch doctors\" or healers to cure their ailments. Many of the herbs (plants) and treatments they use are as effectiv e as the most modern medica tions available. In fact, many modern medications co me from refined herbs. WARNING Use herbal medicines with extreme care, and only when you lack or have limited medical supplies. Some herbal medicines are dangerous and ma y cause further damage or even death. Chapter 9 explains some basic herbal medicine treatments. Chapter 5 Shelters A shelter can protect you from the sun, insects, wind, rain, snow, hot or cold temperatures, and enemy observation. It can give you a feeling of well-be ing and help you maintain your will to survive. In some areas, your need for shelter may take prec edence over your need for f ood and possibly even your need for water. For example, prolonged exposure to cold can cause excessive fatigue and weakness (exhaustion). An exhausted person may develop a \"passive\" outlook, thereby losing the will to survive. Seek natural shelters or alter them to meet your needs, therefore, savi ng energy. A common error in making a shelter is to make it too large. A shelte r must be large enough to protect you and small enough to contain your body heat, especially in cold climates. PRIMARY SHELTER—UNIFORM 5-1. Your primary shelter in a surviv al situation will be your uniform. Th is point is true regardless of whether you are in a hot, cold, tropica l, desert, or arctic situation. Fo r your uniform to protect you, it must be in as good of a condition as possible and be wo rn properly. We use the term COLDER which is addressed in Chapter 15 to remind us of what to do. SHELTER SITE SELECTION 5-2. When you are in a survival situ ation and realize that shelter is a high priority, start looking for shelter as soon as possible. As you do so, reme mber what you will need at the s ite. Two requisites for shelter are that it must— • Contain material to make the type of shelter you need. • Be large enough and level enough for you to lie down comfortably."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" 38 5-3. You should focus on your tactical situation and your safety when considering these requisites. You must also consider whether the site— • Provides concealment from enemy observation. • Has camouflaged escape routes. • Is suitable for signa ling, if necessary. • Provides protection against wild animals a nd rocks and dead trees that might fall. • Is free from insects, rept iles, and poisonous plants. 5-4. You must remember the problems that could arise in your environment. For instance, avoid— • Flash flood areas in foothills. • Avalanche or rockslide ar eas in mountainous terrain. • Sites near bodies of water that are below the high-water mark. 5-5. In some areas, the season of th e year has a strong bearing on the si te you select. Ideal sites for a shelter differ in winter and summer. During cold wint er months you will want a site that will protect you from the cold and wind, but will have a source of fuel and water. During summer months in the same area you will want a source of water, but you will also want the site to be almost insect free. 5-6. When you are considering shelter site select ion, remember the word BLISS and the following guidelines: • B-Blend in with the surroundings. • L-Low silhouette. • I-Irregular shape. • S-Small. • S-Secluded location. TYPES OF SHELTERS 5-7. When looking for a shelter site, keep in mind the type of shelter you need. However, you must also consider the questions below: • How much time and effort will you need to build the shelter? • Will the shelter adequately protect you fr om the elements (sun, wind, rain, snow)? • Do you have the tools to build it? If not, can you make improvised tools? • Do you have the type and amount of materials needed to build it? 5-8. To answer these questions, you need to know how to make various types of shelters and what materials you need to make them. PONCHO LEAN-TO 5-9. It takes only a short time and minima l equipment to build this lean-to ( Figure 5-1 ). You need a poncho, 2 to 3 meters (7 to 10 feet) of rope or parac hute suspension line, three stakes about 30 centimeters (1 foot) long, and two trees or two poles 2 to 3 meters (7 to 10 feet) apart. Be fore selecting the trees you will use or the location of your poles , check the wind direction. Ensure that the back of your lean-to will be into the wind."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" 39 Figure 5-1. Poncho Lean-to 5-10. To make the lean-to, you should— • Tie off the hood of the poncho. Pull the drawstring tight, roll the hood longways, fold it into thirds, and tie it off with the drawstring. • Cut the rope in half. On one long side of the ponc ho, tie half of the rope to the corner grommet. Tie the other half to the other corner grommet. • Attach a drip stick (about a 10-ce ntimeter [4-inch] stick) to each rope about 2.5 centimeters (about 1 inch) from the grommet. These drip sticks wi ll keep rainwater from r unning down the ropes into the lean-to. Tying strings (about 10 centimeters [4 inches] long) to each grommet along the poncho's top edge will allow the water to run to and down the line without dripping into the shelter. • Tie the ropes about waist high on the trees. Use a round turn and tw o half hitches with a quick- release knot. • Spread the poncho and anchor it to the ground, pu tting sharpened sticks through the grommets and into the ground. 5-11. If you plan to use the lean-to for more than one night, or you expect rain, make a center support for the lean-to. Make this su pport with a line. Attach one end of th e line to the poncho hood and the other end to an overhanging branch. Make sure there is no slack in the line. 5-12. Another method is to place a stick upright under the center of the lean-to. However, this method will restrict your space and movements in the shelter. 5-13. For additional protection from wind and rain, pl ace some brush, your rucksack, or other equipment at the sides of the lean-to. 5-14. To reduce heat loss to the ground, place some type of insulating material, such as leaves or pine needles, inside your lean-to. NOTE: When at rest, you lose as much as 80 percent of your body heat to the ground. 5-15. To increase your security from enemy observa tion, lower the lean-to's silhouette by making two changes. First, secure the support lin es to the trees at knee height ( not at waist height) using two knee- high sticks in the two center grommets (sides of lean-to). Second, angle the poncho to the ground, securing it with sharpened sticks, as above. PONCHO TENT"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" 40 5-16. This tent ( Figure 5-2 ) provides a low silhouette. It also protects you from the elements on two sides. It has, however, less usable space and observation area than a lean-to, decreas ing your reaction time to enemy detection. To make this tent, you need a ponc ho, two 1.5- to 2.5-meter (5- to 8-foot) ropes, six sharpened sticks about 30 centimeter s (1 foot) long, and two trees 2 to 3 meters (7 to 10 feet) apart. Figure 5-2. Poncho Tent Using Overhanging Branch 5-17. To make the tent, you should— • Tie off the poncho hood in the same way as the poncho lean-to. • Tie a 1.5- to 2.5-meter (5- to 8-foot) rope to the center grommet on each side of the poncho. • Tie the other ends of these ropes at about knee height to two trees 2 to 3 meters (7 to 10 feet) apart and stretch the poncho tight. • Draw one side of the poncho tight and secure it to the ground pushing sharpened sticks through the grommets. • Follow the same procedure on the other side. 5-18. If you need a center support, use the same me thods as for the poncho lean-to. Another center support is an A-frame set outside but over the center of the tent ( Figure 5-3 ). Use two 90- to 120- centimeter-long (12- to 16-foot-long) sticks, one with a forked end, to form the A-frame. Tie the hood's drawstring to the A-frame to s upport the center of the tent. Figure 5-3. Poncho Tent With A-Frame THREE-POLE PARACHUTE TEPEE 5-19. If you have a parachute and three poles and the tactical situation al lows, make a parachute tepee. It is easy and takes very little time to make this tepee. It provides protection from the elements and can act"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":" 41 as a signaling device by enhancing a sma ll amount of light from a fire or candle. It is large enough to hold several people and their e quipment and to allow sleeping, cooking, and storing firewood. 5-20. You can make this tepee ( Figure 5-4 ) using parts of or a whole pers onnel main or reserve parachute canopy. If using a standard personnel parachute, you n eed three poles 3.5 to 4.5 meters (12 to 15 feet) long and about 5 centimeters (2 inches) in diameter. Figure 5-4. Three-Pole Parachute Tepee 5-21. To make this tepee, you should— • Lay the poles on the ground and la sh them together at one end. • Stand the framework up and spread the poles to form a tripod. • For more support, place additional poles against the tripod. Five or six additional poles work best, but do not lash them to the tripod. • Determine the wind direction and locate the entr ance 90 degrees or more from the mean wind direction. • Lay out the parachute on the \"backside\" of the tr ipod and locate the bridle loop (nylon web loop) at the top (apex) of the canopy. • Place the bridle loop over the top of a freestandin g pole. Then place the pole back up against the tripod so that the canopy's apex is at the same height as the lashing on the three poles."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" 42 • Wrap the canopy around one side of the tripod. The canopy should be of double thickness, as you are wrapping an entire parachute. You need only wrap half of the tripod, as the remainder of the canopy will encircle the tripod in the opposite direction. • Construct the entrance by wrapping the folded edges of the canopy ar ound two free-standing poles. You can then place the poles side by side to close the tepee's entrance. • Place all extra canopy underneath the tepee poles a nd inside to create a floor for the shelter. • Leave a 30- to 50-centimeter (12- to 20-inch) opening at the top for ventilation if you intend to have a fire inside the tepee. 5-22. You need a 14-gore section (normally) of canopy, st akes, a stout center pole , and an inner core and needle to construct this tepee ( Figure 5-5 ). You cut the suspension lines except for 40- to 45-centimeter (16- to 18-inch) lengths at the canopy's lower lateral band. Figure 5-5. One-Pole Parachute Tepee 5-23. To make this tepee, you should— • Select a shelter site and scribe a circle about 4 meters (13 feet) in diameter on the ground. • Stake the parachute material to the ground using the lines remaining at the lower lateral band. • After deciding where to place th e shelter door, emplace a stake a nd tie the first line (from the lower lateral band) securely to it. • Stretch the parachute material taut to the next line, emplace a stake on the scribed line, and tie the line to it. • Continue the staking process until you have tied all the lines. • Loosely attach the top of the parachute materi al to the center pole with a suspension line you previously cut and, through trial and error, determine the point at which the parachute material will be pulled tight once the center pole is upright. • Securely attach the material to the pole. • Using a suspension line (or inner core), sew the en d gores together leaving 1 to 1.2 meters (3 to 4 feet) for a door. NO-POLE PARACHUTE TEPEE 5-24. Except for the center pole, you use the same materials for a no-pole parachute tepee ( Figure 5-6 ), as for the one-pole parachute tepee."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" 43 Figure 5-6. No-Pole Parachute Tepee 5-25. To make this tepee, you should— • Tie a line to the top of parachute material with a previously cut suspension line. • Throw the line over a tree limb, and tie it to the tree trunk. • Starting at the opposite side from the door, emplace a stake on the scribed 3.5- to 4.3-meter (12- to 14-foot) circle. • Tie the first line on the lower lateral band. • Continue emplacing the stakes and tying the lines to them. 5-26. After staking down the material, unfasten the line tied to the tree trunk, tight en the tepee material by pulling on this line, and tie it securely to the tree trunk. ONE-MAN SHELTER 5-27. A one-man shelter ( Figure 5-7 ) you can easily make using a par achute requires a tree and three poles. One pole should be about 4.5 meters (15 feet) long and the other two about 3 meters (10 feet) long. Figure 5-7. One-Man Shelter 5-28. To make this shelter, you should— • Secure the 4.5-meter (15-foot) pole to the tree at about waist height. • Lay the two 3-meter (10-foot) poles on the ground on either side of and in the same direction as the 4.5-meter (15-foot) pole."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" 44 • Lay the folded canopy over the 4.5-meter (15-foot) pol e so that about the same amount of material hangs on both sides. • Tuck the excess material under the 3-meter (10-foot ) poles and spread it on the ground inside to serve as a floor. • Stake down or put a spreader betw een the two 3-meter (10-foot) poles at the shelter's entrance so they will not slide inward. • Use any excess material to cover the entrance. 5-29. The parachute cloth makes this sh elter wind-resistant, and the shelte r is small enough that it is easily warmed. A candle, used carefully, can keep the inside temperature comfortable. However, this shelter is unsatisfactory when snow is falling, as even a light snow fall will cave it in. PARACHUTE HAMMOCK 5-30. You can make a hammock using six to eight gores of parachute canopy and two trees about 4.5 meters (15 feet) apart ( Figure 5-8 ). Figure 5-8. Parachute Hammock FIELD-EXPEDIENT LEAN-TO"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" 45 5-31. If you are in a wooded area and have enough natura l materials, you can make a field-expedient lean- to ( Figure 5-9 ) without the aid of tools or with only a knife. It takes longer to make this type of shelter than it does to make other types, bu t it will protect you from the elements. Figure 5-9. Field-Expedient Lean-to and Fire Reflector 5-32. You will need two trees (or upri ght poles) about 2 meters (7 feet) apart; one pole about 2 meters (7 feet) long and 2.5 centimeters (1 inch) in diameter; five to eight pol es about 3 meters (10 feet) long and 2.5 centimeters (1 inch) in diameter for beams; cord or vines for securing the horizontal support to the trees; and other poles, saplings, or vines to crisscross the beams. 5-33. To make this lean-to, you should— • Tie the 2-meter (7-foot) pole to the two trees at waist to chest height. This is the horizontal support. If a standing tree is not available, construct a bipod using Y-shaped sticks or two tripods. • Place one end of the beams (3-meter [10-foot] pole s) on one side of the horizontal support. As with all lean-to type shelters , be sure to place the lean -to's backside into the wind. • Crisscross saplings or vines on the beams. • Cover the framework with brush, leaves, pine needle s, or grass, starting at the bottom and working your way up like shingling. • Place straw, leaves, pine needles, or grass inside the shelter for bedding. 5-34. In cold weather, add to your lean-to' s comfort by building a fire reflector wall ( Figure 5-9 ). Drive four 1.5-meter-long (5-foot-long) stakes into the ground to support the wa ll. Stack green logs on top of one another between the support stakes. Form two rows of stacked logs to create an inner space within the wall that you can fill with dirt. This action not only strengthens the wall but makes it more heat reflective. Bind the top of the support stakes so that th e green logs and dirt will stay in place. 5-35. With just a little more effort you can have a drying rack. Cut a few 2-centimeter-diameter (3/4-inch- diameter) poles long enough to span the distance between the lean-to's horizontal support and the top of the fire reflector wall. Lay one end of the poles on the lean-to support and the other end on top of the reflector wall. Place and tie smaller sticks across thes e poles. You now have a place to dry clothes, meat, or fish. SWAMP BED"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" 46 5-36. In a marsh or swamp, or any area with standi ng water or continually wet ground, the swamp bed (Figure 5-10 ) keeps you out of the water. When selecting su ch a site, consider the weather, wind, tides, and available materials. Figure 5-10. Swamp Bed 5-37. To make a swamp bed, you should— • Look for four trees clustered in a rectangle, or cut four poles (bamboo is ideal) and drive them firmly into the ground so they form a rectangl e. They should be far enough apart and strong enough to support your height and we ight, to include equipment. • Cut two poles that span the widt h of the rectangle. They, too, must be strong enough to support your weight. • Secure these two poles to the trees (or poles). Be sure they are high enough above the ground or water to allow for tides and high water. • Cut additional poles that span the rectangle's le ngth. Lay them across the two side poles and secure them. • Cover the top of the bed frame with broad leaves or grass to form a soft sleeping surface. • Build a fire pad by laying clay, silt, or mud on one corner of the swamp bed and allow it to dry. 5-38. Another shelter designed to get you above and out of the water or wet ground uses the same rectangular configuration as the sw amp bed. You simply lay sticks and branches lengthwise on the inside of the trees (or poles) unt il there is enough material to raise the sleeping surface above the water level. NATURAL SHELTERS 5-39. Do not overlook natural formations that provide sh elter. Examples are caves, rocky crevices, clumps of bushes, small depressions, large rocks on leeward sides of hills, large trees with low-hanging limbs, and fallen trees with thick branches. Howe ver, when selecting a natural formation— • Stay away from low ground such as ravines, narr ow valleys, or creek beds . Low areas collect the heavy cold air at night and are therefore co lder than the surrounding high ground. Thick, brushy, low ground also harbors more insects. • Check for poisonous snakes, ticks, mites, scorpions, and stinging ants. • Look for loose rocks, dead limbs, coconuts, or other natural growth than c ould fall on your shelter. DEBRIS HUT 5-40. For warmth and ease of construction, the debris hut ( Figure 5-11 ) is one of the best. When shelter is essential to survival, build this shelter."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" 47 Figure 5-11. Debris Hut 5-41. To make a debris hut, you should— • Build it by making a tripod with two short stakes and a long ridgepole or by placing one end of a long ridgepole on top of a sturdy base. • Secure the ridgepole (pole runni ng the length of the shelter) using the tripod method or by anchoring it to a tree at about waist height. • Prop large sticks along both sides of the ridgepole to create a wedge-shaped ribbing effect. Ensure the ribbing is wide enough to accommodate your body and steep enough to shed moisture. • Place finer sticks and brush crosswise on the ribb ing. These form a latticework that will keep the insulating material (grass, pine needles, leav es) from falling through the ribbing into the sleeping area. • Add light, dry, if possible, soft debris over the ri bbing until the insulating material is at least 1 meter (3 feet) thick—the thicker the better. • Place a 30-centimeter (1-foot) layer of insu lating material inside the shelter. • At the entrance, pile insulating material that you can drag to you once inside the shelter to close the entrance or build a door. • As a final step in constructing this shelter, add shingling material or branch es on top of the debris layer to prevent the insulating materi al from blowing away in a storm. TREE-PIT SNOW SHELTER 5-42. If you are in a cold, snow-c overed area where evergreen trees grow and you have a digging tool, you can make a tree-pit shelter ( Figure 5-12 )."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" 48 Figure 5-12. Tree-Pit Snow Shelter 5-43. To make this shelter, you should— • Find a tree with bushy branches th at provides overhead cover. • Dig out the snow around the tree trunk until you reach the depth and diameter you desire, or until you reach the ground. • Pack the snow around the top and the in side of the hole to provide support. • Find and cut other evergreen boughs. Place them ove r the top of the pit to give you additional overhead cover. Place evergreen boughs in the bottom of the pit for insulation. 5-44. See Chapter 15 for other arctic or cold weather shelters. BEACH SHADE SHELTER 5-45. The beach shade shelter ( Figure 5-13 ) protects you from the sun, wind, rain, and heat. It is easy to make using natural materials. Figure 5-13. Beach Shade Shelter 5-46. To make this shelter, you should— • Find and collect driftwood or othe r natural material to use as s upport beams and as a digging tool. • Select a site that is above the high water mark."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" 49 • Scrape or dig out a trench running north to south so that it receives the least amount of sunlight. Make the trench long and wide e nough for you to lie down comfortably. • Mound soil on three sides of the trench. The higher the mound, the more space inside the shelter. • Lay support beams (driftwood or other natural mate rial) that span the tr ench on top of the mound to form the framework for a roof. • Enlarge the shelter's entrance by digg ing out more sand in front of it. • Use natural materials such as grass or leaves to form a bed inside the shelter. DESERT SHELTERS 5-47. In an arid environment, consider the time, effort, and material needed to make a shelter. If you have material such as a poncho, canvas, or a parachute, use it along with such terrain features as rock outcroppings, mounds of sand, or depressions be tween dunes or rocks to make your shelter. 5-48. When using rock outcroppings, you should— • Anchor one end of your poncho (canvas, parachute, or other material) on the edge of the outcrop using rocks or other weights. • Extend and anchor the other end of the poncho so it provides the be st possible shade. 5-49. In a sandy area, you should— • Build a mound of sand or use the side of a sand dune for one side of the shelter. • Anchor one end of the material on top of the mound using sand or other weights. • Extend and anchor the other end of the material so it provides the be st possible shade. NOTE: If you have enough material, fold it in half and form a 30- to 45-centimeter (12- to 18-inch) airspace between the two halves. This airspace will reduce the temperat ure under the shelter. 5-50. A belowground shelter ( Figure 5-14 ) can reduce the midday heat as much as 16 to 22 degrees C (30 to 40 degrees F). However, building it requires more time and effort th an for other shelters. Since your physical effort will make you sweat mo re and increase dehydrati on, construct it before the heat of the day. "},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":" 50 Figure 5-14. Belowground Desert Shelter 5-51. To make this shelter, you should— • Find a low spot or depression between dunes or rocks. If necessary, dig a trench 45 to 60 centimeters (18 to 24 inches) deep, and long a nd wide enough for you to lie in comfortably. • Pile the sand you take from the trench to form a mound around three sides. • On the open end of the trench, dig out more sand so you can get in and out of your shelter easily. • Cover the trench with your material. • Secure the material in place using sand, rocks, or other weights. 5-52. If you have extra material, you can further d ecrease the midday temperat ure in the trench by securing the material 30 to 45 centimet ers (12 to 18 inches) above the ot her cover. This layering of the material will reduce the inside temperatur e 11 to 22 degrees C (20 to 40 degrees F). 5-53. The open desert shelter is of similar construction, except all sides are open to air currents and circulation. For maximum protection, you need a mi nimum of two layers of parachute material (Figure 5- 15 ). White is the best color to reflect heat; the innermost layer should be of darker material. Figure 5-15. Open Desert Shelter Chapter 6 Water Procurement Water is one of your most urgent needs in a survival situation. You can't live long without it, especially in hot areas where you lose water rapi dly through perspiration. Even in co ld areas, you need a minimum of 2 liters of water each day to maintain efficiency. More than three-fourths of your body is composed of fluids. Your body loses fluid because of heat, cold, stress, and exertion. To function e ffectively, you must replace the fluid your body loses. So, one of your first goals is to obtain an adequate supply of water. WATER SOURCES 6-1. Almost any environment has water present to some degree. Figure 6-1 lists possible sources of water in various environments. It also provides information on how to make the water potable."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":" 51 NOTE: If you do not have a canteen, cup, can, or other type of container, improvise one from plastic or water-resistant cloth.

Tie rags or tuft s of fine grass around your ankles and walk through dew-covered grass before sunrise. As the rags or grass tufts absorb the dew, wring the water into a container. Repeat the process until you have a supply of water or until the dew is gone. Australian natives sometimes mop up as much as 1 liter an hour this way. 6-4. Bees or ants going into a hole in a tree may point to a water-filled hole. Siphon the water with plastic tubing or scoop it up with an improvised dipper. You can also stuff cloth in the hole to absorb the water and then wring it from the cloth. 6-5. Water sometimes gathers in tree crotches or rock crevices. Use the above procedures to get the water. In arid areas, bird droppings ar ound a crack in the rocks may indicat e water in or near the crack. 6-6. Green bamboo thickets are an excellent source of fresh water. Water from green bamboo is clear and odorless. To get the water, bend a green bam boo stalk, tie it down, and cut off the top ( Figure 6-3 ). The water will drip freely during the night. Old, cracked bamboo may also contain water. Figure 6-3. Water From Green Bamboo CAUTION - Purify the water before drinking it."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" 54 6-7. Wherever you find banana trees, plantain trees, or sugarcane, you can get water. Cut down the tree, leaving about a 30-centimeter (12-in ch) stump, and scoop out the center of the stump so that the hollow is bowl-shaped. Water from the roots w ill immediately start to fill the holl ow. The first three fillings of water will be bitter, but succeeding fill ings will be palatable. The stump ( Figure 6-4 ) will supply water for up to 4 days. Be sure to cover it to keep out insects. Figure 6-4. Water From Planta in or Banana Tree Stump 6-8. Some tropical vines can give you water. Cut a notch in the vine as high as you can reach, then cut the vine off close to the ground. Catch the droppi ng liquid in a containe r or in your mouth ( Figure 6-5 ). CAUTION - Ensure that the vine is not poisonous. Figure 6-5. Water From a Vine"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":" 55 6-9. The milk from young, green (unripe) coconuts is a good thirst quencher. However, the milk from mature, brown, coconuts contains an oil that ac ts as a laxative. Dri nk in moderation only. CAUTION - Do not drink the liquid if it is st icky, milky, or bitter tasting. 6-10. In the American tropics you may find large trees whose branches support air plants. These air plants may hold a considerable amount of rainwater in th eir overlapping, thickly growing leaves. Strain the water through a cloth to remove insects and debris. 6-11. You can get water from plants with moist pulpy centers. Cut off a section of the plant and squeeze or smash the pulp so that the moisture runs out. Catch the liquid in a container. 6-12. Plant roots may provide water. Dig or pry the roots out of the ground, cut them into short pieces, and smash the pulp so that the moisture ru ns out. Catch the liqui d in a container. 6-13. Fleshy leaves, stems, or stalks, such as bamboo, c ontain water. Cut or notch th e stalks at the base of a joint to drain out the liquid. 6-14. The following trees can also provide water: • Palms. The buri, coconut, sugar, rattan, and nips contain liquid. Bruise a lower frond and pull it down so the tree will \"bl eed\" at the injury. • Traveler's tree. Found in Madagascar, this tree has a cuplik e sheath at the base of its leaves in which water collects. • Umbrella tree. The leaf bases and roots of this tree of western tropical Africa can provide water. • Baobab tree. This tree of the sandy plains of northern Australia and Africa collects water in its bottlelike trunk during the wet season. Frequently, you can find clear, fresh water in these trees after weeks of dry weather. CAUTION - Do not keep the sap from plants longer th an 24 hours. It begins fermenting, becoming dangerous as a water source. STILL CONSTRUCTION 6-15. You can use stills in various areas of the world. They draw moisture from the ground and from plant material. You need certain materials to build a still, a nd you need time to let it collect the water. It takes about 24 hours to get 0.5 to 1 liter of water. ABOVEGROUND STILLS 6-16. You can construct two types of aboveground stills. To make the vegetation bag still , you need a sunny slope on which to place the stil l, a clear plastic bag, green leafy vegetation, and a small rock (Figure 6-6 )."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" 56 Figure 6-6. Vegetation Bag Still 6-17. To make the still, you should— • Fill the bag with air by turning the opening into the breeze or by \"scooping\" air into the bag. • Fill the plastic bag one-half to three-fourths full of green leafy vegetation. Be sure to remove all hard sticks or sharp spines that might puncture the bag. • Place a small rock or similar item in the bag. • Close the bag and tie the mouth s ecurely as close to the end of the bag as possible to keep the maximum amount of air space. If you have a pie ce of tubing, a small straw, or a hollow reed, insert one end in the mouth of the bag before you ti e it securely. Then tie off or plug the tubing so that air will not escape. This tubing will allow you to drain out condensed water without untying the bag. CAUTION - Do not use poisonous vegetation. It will provide poisonous liquid. • Place the bag, mouth downhill, on a slope in full s unlight. Position the mouth of the bag slightly higher than the low point in the bag. • Settle the bag in place so that the rock works itself into the low point in the bag. 6-18. To get the condensed water from the still, loos en the tie around the bag's mouth and tip the bag so that the water collected around the rock will drain out . Then retie the mouth securely and reposition the still to allow further condensation. 6-19. Change the vegetation in the bag after extracti ng most of the water from it. This will ensure maximum output of water. 6-20. Making a transpiration bag still is similar to the vegetation bag, only easier. Simply tie the plastic bag over a leafy tree limb with a tube inserted, and tie the mouth of the bag off tightly around the branch to form an airtight seal. Tie the end of the limb so that it hangs belo w the level of the mouth of the bag. The water will collect there ( Figure 6-7 )."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":" 57 Figure 6-7. Water Transpiration Bag 6-21. The same limb may be used for 3 to 5 days w ithout causing long-term harm to the limb. It will heal itself within a few hours of removing the bag. BELOWGROUND STILL 6-22. To make a belowground still, you need a digging tool, a container, a clear plastic sheet, a drinking tube, and a rock ( Figure 6-8 ). Figure 6-8. Belowground Still 6-23. Select a site where you believe the soil will cont ain moisture (such as a dry streambed or a low spot where rainwater has collected). The so il at this site should be easy to di g, and sunlight must hit the site most of the day. 6-24. To construct the still, you should— • Dig a bowl-shaped hole about 1 meter (3 feet ) across and 60 centimeter s (24 inches) deep. • Dig a sump in the center of the hole. The sump's depth and perimeter will depend on the size of the container that you have to place in it. The bottom of the sump should allow the container to stand upright. • Anchor the tubing to the container's bottom by forming a loose overhand knot in the tubing. • Place the container upright in the sump. • Extend the unanchored end of the tubing up, over, and beyond the lip of the hole."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":" 58 • Place the plastic sheet over the hole, covering its edges with soil to hold it in place. • Place a rock in the center of the plastic sheet. • Lower the plastic sheet into the hole until it is about 40 centimeters (16 inches) below ground level. It now forms an inverted c one with the rock at its apex. Make sure that the cone's apex is directly over your container. Also make sure the plastic cone does not touc h the sides of the hole because the earth will absorb the condensed water. • Put more soil on the edges of the plastic to hold it securely in place and to prevent the loss of moisture. • Plug the tube when not in use to keep the moisture from evaporating and to keep insects out. 6-25. You can drink water without dist urbing the still by using the tube as a straw. By opening the still, you release the moist, warm air that has accumulated. 6-26. You may want to use plants in the hole as a moisture source. If so, dig out additional soil from the sides of the hole to form a slope on which to place the plants. Then proceed as above. 6-27. If polluted water is your onl y moisture source, dig a small trough outside the hole about 25 centimeters (10 inches) from the still's lip ( Figure 6-9 ). Dig the trough about 25 centimeters (10 inches) deep and 8 centimeters (3 inches) wide. Pour the po lluted water in the trough. Be sure you do not spill any polluted water around the rim of the hole where the pl astic sheet touches the soil. The trough holds the polluted water and the soil filters it as the still draws it. The water then condenses on the plastic and drains into the container. This proce ss works extremely well when your onl y water source is salt water. Figure 6-9. Belowground Still to Get Potable Water From Polluted Water 6-28. You will need at least three stills to meet your individual daily water intake needs. In comparison to the belowground still and the water tr anspiration bag still, the vegetati on bag produces the best yield of water. WATER PURIFICATION 6-29. Rainwater collected in clean co ntainers or in plants is usually safe for drinking. However, purify water from lakes, ponds, swamps, springs, or streams, especially the water near human settlements or in the tropics."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":" 59 6-30. When possible, purify all water you get from vegetation or from the ground by boiling or using iodine or chlorine. After purifying a canteen of water, you must partia lly unscrew the ca p and turn the canteen upside down to rinse unpurified water from the threads of the canteen where your mouth touches. 6-31. Purify water by the following methods: • Use water purification tablets. (F ollow the directions provided.) • Place 5 drops of 2 percent tincture of iodine in a cant een full of clear water. If the canteen is full of cloudy or cold water, use 10 drops. (Let the ca nteen of water stand for 30 minutes before drinking.) • Use 2 drops of 10 percent (military strength) povidone-iodine or 1 percent titrated povidone- iodine. The civilian equivalent is usually 2 perc ent strength, so 10 drops will be needed. Let stand for 30 minutes. If the water is co ld and clear, wait 60 minutes. If it's very cold or cloudy, add 4 drops and wait 60 minutes. • Place 2 drops of chlorine bleach (5.25 percent so dium hypochlorite) in a canteen of water. Let stand 30 minutes. If the water is cold or cloudy, wait 60 minutes. Reme mber that not all bleach is the same around the world; check the av ailable level of sodium hypochlorite. • Use potassium permanganate, commonly marketed as Condy's Crystals, for a number of applications, including emergency disinfection of water. The crystals are of a nonuniform size, so you must judge the actual dosage by the color of the water afte r adding the crystals. Add three small crystals to 1 liter (1 quart ) of water. If the water turns a bright pink after waiting 30 minutes, the water is considered purified. If the water turns a dark pink, there is too much potassium permanganate to drink safely. Either add more water to dilute the mixture or save it for use as an antiseptic solution. If the water becomes a full red, like the colo r of cranberry juice, the solution may be used as an antifungal solution. • Boil your drinking water. This is the safest me thod of purifying your drinking water. By achieving a rolling boil, you can ensure that you are destroying all living waterborne pathogens. 6-32. By drinking nonpotable water you may contract di seases or swallow organisms that can harm you and may easily lead to potentially fatal waterborne illnesses. 6-33. Two of the most prevalent pathogens found in most water s ources throughout the world are— • Giardia, which causes Giardiasis (beaver fever). It is characterized by an explosive, watery diarrhea accompanied by severe cramps lasting 7 to 14 days. • Cryptosporidium, which causes Cryptosporidiosis. It is much like Giardiasis, only more severe and prolonged, and there is no known cure but time. Diarrhea may be mild and can last from 3 days to 2 weeks. NOTE: The only effective means of ne utralizing Cryptosporidium is by boiling or by using a commercial microfilter or reverse-osmosis filtrat ion system. Chemical disinfectants such as iodine tablets or bleach have not shown to be 100 percent effective in eliminating Cryptosporidium. 6-34. Examples of other dis eases or organisms are— • Dysentery. You may experience severe , prolonged diarrhea with bloody stools, fever, and weakness."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":" 60 • Cholera and typhoid. You may be susceptible to these diseas es regardless of i noculations. Cholera can cause profuse, watery diarrhea, vomiting, an d leg cramps. Typhoid symptoms include fever, headache, loss of appetite, consti pation, and bleeding in the bowel. • Hepatitis A. Symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal pain, jaundice, and dark urine. This infection can spread through close person-to-person contact or ingestion of contaminated water or food. • Flukes. Stagnant, polluted water—especi ally in tropical ar eas—often contains blood flukes. If you swallow flukes, they will bore into the bloodstr eam, live as parasites, and cause disease. • Leeches. If you swallow a leech, it can hook onto the throat passage or inside the nose. It will suck blood, create a wound, and move to another area. Each bleeding wound may become infected. WATER FILTRATION DEVICES 6-35. If the water you find is also muddy, stagna nt, and foul-smelling, you can clear the water— • By placing it in a container and letting it stand for 12 hours. • By pouring it through a filtering system. NOTE: These procedures only clear the water and make it more palatable. You will have to purify it. 6-36. To make a filtering system, place several centimet ers or layers of filtering material such as sand, crushed rock, charcoal, or cloth in bamboo, a hollow log, or an ar ticle of clothing ( Figure 6-10 ). Figure 6-10. Water Filtering Systems 6-37. Remove the odor from water by adding charcoal from your fire. Charcoal is also helpful in absorbing some agricultural and industrial chemicals. Let the water stand for 45 minutes before drinking it. Chapter 7 Firecraft In many survival situations, the ability to start a fire can make the difference between living and dying. Fire can fulfill many needs. It can provide warmth and comfort. It not only cooks and preserves food, it also provides warmth in the form of heated food that saves calories our body normally uses to produce body heat. You can use fire to purif y water, sterilize bandages, signal for rescue, and provide protection"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":" 61 from animals. It can be a psychological boost by providing peace of mind and companionship. You can also use fire to produ ce tools and weapons. Fire can cause problems, as well. The enemy can de tect the smoke and light it produces. It can cause forest fires or destroy essential equipment. Fire can also cause burns a nd carbon monoxide poisoning when used in shelters. Weigh your need for fire against you r need to avoid enemy detection. BASIC FIRE PRINCIPLES 7-1. To build a fire, it helps to understand the basic pr inciples of a fire. Fuel (in a nongaseous state) does not burn directly. When you apply heat to a fuel, it pr oduces a gas. This gas, combined with oxygen in the air, burns. 7-2. Understanding the concept of the fire triangle is very importa nt in correctly constructing and maintaining a fire. The three sides of the triangle represent air, heat, and fuel . If you remove any of these, the fire will go out. The correct ratio of these components is very important for a fire to burn at its greatest capability. The only way to learn this ratio is to practice. SITE SELECTION AND PREPARATION 7-3. You will have to decide what site and arrangement to use. Before building a fire consider— • The area (terrain and climate) in which you are operating. • The materials and tools available. • Time; how much time do you have? • Need; why do you need a fire? • Security; how close is the enemy? 7-4. Look for a dry spot that— • Is protected from the wind. • Is suitably placed in relation to your shelter (if any). • Will concentrate the heat in the direction you desire. • Has a supply of wood or ot her fuel available. ( Figure 7-4 lists types of material you can use.) 7-5. If you are in a wooded or brush-covered area, clea r the brush and scrape the surface soil from the spot you have selected. Clear a circle at least 1 meter (3 f eet) in diameter so there is little chance of the fire spreading. 7-6. If time allows, construct a fire wall using logs or ro cks. This wall will help to reflect or direct the heat where you want it ( Figure 7-1 ). It will also reduce flying sparks and cut down on the amount of wind blowing into the fire. However, you will n eed enough wind to keep the fire burning. CAUTION - Do not use wet or porous rocks as they may explode when heated."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":" 62 Figure 7-1. Types of Fire Walls 7-7. In some situations, you may find that an undergr ound fireplace will best meet your needs. It conceals the fire and serves well for cooking food. To ma ke an underground firepla ce or Dakota fire hole ( Figure 7-2 )— • Dig a hole in the ground. • On the upwind side of this hole, poke or dig a large connecting hole for ventilation. • Build your fire in the hole as illustrated. Figure 7-2. Dakota Fire Hole 7-8. If you are in a snow-covered area, use gree n logs to make a dry base for your fire ( Figure 7-3 ). Trees with wrist-sized trunks are easily broken in extreme cold. Cut or break several green logs and lay them side by side on top of the snow. A dd one or two more layers. Lay th e top layer of logs opposite those below it."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" 63 Figure 7-3. Base for Fire in Snow-covered Area FIRE MATERIAL SELECTION 7-9. You need three types of materials ( Figure 7-4 ) to build a fire. Figure 7-4. Materials for Building Fires"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" 64 Figure 7-4. Materials for Building Fires (Continued) 7-10. Tinder is dry material that ignites with little heat—a spar k starts a fire. The tinder must be absolutely dry to be sure just a sp ark will ignite it. If you have a device that generates only sparks, charred cloth will be almost essential. It holds a spark for long periods, allo wing you to put tinder on the hot area to generate a small flame. You can make charred cloth by heating cotton clot h until it turns black, but does not burn. Once it is black, you must keep it in an ai rtight container to keep it dry. Prepare this cloth well in advance of any survival si tuation. Add it to your individual surv ival kit. Other impromptu items could be alcohol pads or petroleum jelly gauze. 7-11. Kindling is readily combustible material that you add to the burni ng tinder. Again, this material should be absolutely dry to ensure rapid burning. Kind ling increases the fire's temperature so that it will ignite less combustible material. 7-12. Fuel is less combustible material that burns slowly and st eadily once ignited. HOW TO BUILD A FIRE 7-13. There are several methods for laying a fire and each one has advantages. The situation you are in will determine which of the following fires to use. TEPEE"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":" 65 7-14. To make a tepee fire ( Figure 7-5 ), arrange the tinder and a few sticks of kindling in the shape of a tepee or cone. Light the center. As the tepee burns, th e outside logs will fall inwa rd, feeding the fire. This type of fire burns well even with wet wood. LEAN-TO 7-15. To lay a lean-to fire ( Figure 7-5 ), push a green stick into the ground at a 30-degree angle. Point the end of the stick in the direction of the wind. Place some tinder deep unde r this lean-to stick. Lean pieces of kindling against the lean-to stic k. Light the tinder. As the kindling catches fire from the tinder, add more kindling. CROSS-DITCH 7-16. To use the cross-ditch method ( Figure 7-5 ), scratch a cross about 30 cen timeters (12 inches) in size in the ground. Dig the cross 7.5 centimeters (about 3 in ches) deep. Put a large wad of tinder in the middle of the cross. Build a kindling pyram id above the tinder. The shallow ditch allows air to sweep under the tinder to provide a draft. PYRAMID 7-17. To lay the pyramid fire ( Figure 7-5 ), place two small logs or bran ches parallel on the ground. Place a solid layer of small logs across th e parallel logs. Add three or four more layers of logs, each layer smaller than and at a right angle to the layer below it. Make a starter fire on top of the pyramid. As the starter fire burns, it will ignite th e logs below it. This gives you a fire that burns downward, requiring no attention during the night. Figure 7-5. Methods for Laying Fires 7-18. There are several other ways to lay a fire that are quite effective. Your situation and the material available in the area may make another method more suitable. HOW TO LIGHT A FIRE 7-19. Always light your fire from th e upwind side. Make sure you lay the tinder, kindling, and fuel so that your fire will burn as long as you need it. Igniters provide the initial heat re quired to start the tinder burning. They fall into two categories: modern methods and primitive methods."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":" 66 MODERN METHODS 7-20. Modern igniters use modern devices. These are items that we normally think of to start a fire. Matches 7-21. Make sure these matches are wa terproof. Also, store them in a waterproof container along with a dependable striker pad. Convex Lens 7-22. Use this method (Figure 7-6 ) only on bright, sunny days. The lens can come from binoculars, a camera, telescopic sights, or magnifying glasses. Angle the lens to concentrate the sun's rays on the tinder. Hold the lens over the same spot until the tinder begins to smolder. Gently blow or fan the tinder into a flame and apply it to the fire lay. Figure 7-6. Lens Method Metal Match 7-23. Place a flat, dry leaf under your tinder with a por tion exposed. Place the tip of the metal match on the dry leaf, holding the metal match in one hand and a knife in the ot her. Scrape your knife against the metal match to produce sparks. The sparks will hit the tinder. When the tinder starts to smolder, proceed as above. Battery 7-24. Use a battery to generate a spark. Use of this method depends on the type of battery available. Attach a wire to each terminal. Touch the ends of the bare wires together next to the tinder so the sparks will ignite it. Gunpowder 7-25. Often, you will have ammunition with your equipmen t. If so, carefully extract the bullet from the shell casing by moving the bullet back and forth. Us e the gunpowder as tinder. Discard the casing and primers. A spark will ignite the powder. NOTE: Be extremely careful during this operation as the primers are still sensitive and even a small pile of gunpowder can give surprising results."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":" 67 PRIMITIVE METHODS 7-26. Primitive igniters are those at tributed to our early ancestors. They can be time-consuming, which requires you to be patient and persistent. Flint and Steel 7-27. The direct spark method is the easiest of the pr imitive methods to use. The flint and steel method is the most reliable of the direct spark methods. Strike a flint or other har d, sharp-edged rock with a piece of carbon steel (stainless steel will not produce a good spark). This method requires a loose-jointed wrist and practice. When the tinder catches a spark, blow on it. The spark will spread and burst into flames. Fire-Plow 7-28. The fire-plow ( Figure 7-7 ) is a friction method of ignition. To use this method, cut a straight groove in a softwood base and plow the blunt tip of a hardwood shaft up and dow n the groove. The plowing action of the shaft pushes out small particles of wood fibers. Then, as you apply more pressure on each stroke, the friction igni tes the wood particles. Figure 7-7. Fire-Plow Bow and Drill 7-29. The technique of starting a fire with a bow and drill ( Figure 7-8 ) is simple, but you must exert much effort and be persistent to produce a fire. Y ou need the following items to use this method: • Socket. The socket is an easily grasped stone or pi ece of hardwood with a slight depression in one side. Use it to hold the drill in pl ace and to apply downward pressure. • Drill. The drill should be a straight, seasoned hard wood stick about 2 centimeters (3/4 inch) in diameter and 25 centimeters (10 inches) long. Th e top end is round and the low end blunt (to produce more friction). • Fire board. Although any board may be used, a seasone d softwood board about 2.5 centimeters (1 inch) thick and 10 centimeters (4 inches) wide is preferable. Cu t a depression about 2 centimeters (3/4 inch) from the edge on one side of the board. On the underside, make a V-shaped cut from the edge of the board to the depression."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" 68 • Bow. The bow is a resilient, green stick about 2.5 centimeters (3/4 inch) in diameter with a bowstring. The type of wood is not important. The bowstring can be any type of cordage. Tie the bowstring from one end of the bow to the other, without any slack. Figure 7-8. Bow and Drill 7-30. To use the bow and drill, first prepare the fire lay. Then place a bundle of tinder under the V-shaped cut in the fire board. Place one foot on the fire board. Loop the bowstri ng over the drill and place the drill in the precut depression on the fire board. Place the sock et, held in one hand, on the top of the drill to hold it in position. Press down on the drill and saw the bow back and forth to twirl the drill ( Figure 7-8 ). Once you have established a smooth motion, apply more dow nward pressure and work the bow faster. This action will grind hot black powder into the tinder, cau sing a spark to catch. Bl ow on the tinder until it ignites. 7-31. Primitive fire-building methods are exhausting and require practice to ensure success. If your survival situation requires the us e of primitive methods, remember the following hints to help you construct and maintain the fire: • If possible, use nonaromatic seasoned hardwood for fuel. • Collect kindling and tinder along the trail. • Add insect repellent to the tinder. • Keep the firewood dry. • Dry damp firewood near the fire. • Bank the fire to keep the coals alive overnight. • Carry lighted punk, when possible. • Be sure the fire is out before leaving camp. • Do not select wood lying on the ground. It may a ppear to be dry but ge nerally doesn't provide enough friction. Chapter 8 Food Procurement"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":" 69 One of man's most urgent requirements is food. In contemplating virtually any hypothetical survival situation, the mind immediat ely turns to thoughts of food. Unless the situati on occurs in an arid environment, even water, which is more important to maintaining body functions, will usually follow food in our initial thoughts. The survivor must rememb er that the three essentials of survival—water, food, and shelter—are prioritiz ed according to the estimate of the actu al situation. This estimate must not only be timely but accurate as well. We can live for weeks without food but it may take days or weeks to determine what is safe to eat and to trap animals in the area. Therefore, you n eed to begin food gathering in the earliest stages of survival as your enduran ce will decrease daily. Some situations may well dictate that shelter precede both food and water. ANIMALS FOR FOOD 8-1. Unless you have the chance to take large game, concentrate your effo rts on the smaller animals. They are more abundant and easier to prepare. You need not know all the animal specie s that are suitable as food; relatively few are poisonous, and they make a smaller list to remember. However, it is important to learn the habits and behavioral patt erns of classes of animals. For ex ample, animals that are excellent choices for trapping, those that inha bit a particular range and occupy a den or nest, those that have somewhat fixed feeding areas, and thos e that have trails leading from one area to another. Larger, herding animals, such as elk or caribou, roam vast areas and are somewhat more difficult to trap. Also, you must understand the food choices of a particular species to select the proper bait. 8-2. You can, with relatively few excep tions, eat anything that crawls, swim s, walks, or flies. You must first overcome your natural aversion to a particular food source. Historically, people in starvation situations have resorted to ea ting everything imaginable for nour ishment. A person who ignores an otherwise healthy food source due to a personal bias, or because he feels it is unappetizing, is risking his own survival. Although it may prove difficult at first, you must eat what is av ailable to maintain your health. Some classes of animals and insects may be eaten raw if necessary, but you should, if possible, thoroughly cook all food sources when ever possible to avoid illness. INSECTS 8-3. The most abundant and easily ca ught life-form on earth are insects. Many insects provide 65 to 80 percent protein compared to 20 percent for beef. This fact makes insects an important, if not overly appetizing, food source. Insects to avoi d include all adults that sting or bite, hairy or brightly colored insects, and caterpillars and inse cts that have a pungent odor. Also avoid spiders and common disease carriers such as ticks, flies, and mosquitoes. 8-4. Rotting logs lying on the ground are excellent plac es to look for a variety of insects including ants, termites, beetles, and grubs, whic h are beetle larvae. Do not overlook insect nests on or in the ground. Grassy areas, such as fields, are good areas to search because the inse cts are easily seen. Stones, boards, or other materials lying on the gr ound provide the insects with good ne sting sites. Check these sites. Insect larvae are also edible. Inse cts that have a hard outer shell su ch as beetles and grasshoppers will have parasites. Cook them before eating. Remove any wings and barbed legs also. You can eat most soft- shelled insects raw. The taste varies from one species to another. Wood grubs are bland, but some species of ants store honey in their bodies, giving them a sweet taste. You can gr ind a collection of insects into a paste. You can mix them with edible vegetati on. You can cook them to improve their taste. WORMS"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" 70 8-5. Worms ( Annelidea ) are an excellent protein source. Dig fo r them in damp humus soil and in the rootball of grass clumps, or watch for them on th e ground after a rain. After capturing them, drop them into clean, potable water for about 15 minutes. The wo rms will naturally purge or wash themselves out, after which you can eat them raw. CRUSTACEANS 8-6. Freshwater shrimp range in size from 0.25 centimeter (1/16 inch) up to 2.5 cen timeters (1 inch). They can form rather large colonies in mats of floa ting algae or in mud bottoms of ponds and lakes. 8-7. Crayfish are akin to marine l obsters and crabs. You can distinguish them by their hard exoskeleton and five pairs of legs, the front pair having oversi zed pincers. Crayfish are active at night, but you can locate them in the daytime by looking under and around stones in streams. You can also find them by looking in the soft mud near the ch imney-like breathing holes of thei r nests. You can catch crayfish by tying bits of offal or internal orga ns to a string. When the crayfish grab s the bait, pull it to shore before it has a chance to release the bait. 8-8. You can find saltwater lobsters, crabs, and shrimp from the surf's edge out to water 10 meters (33 feet) deep. Shrimp may come to a light at night where you can scoop them up with a net. You can catch lobsters and crabs with a baited trap or a baited hook. Crabs will come to bait placed at the edge of the surf, where you can trap or net th em. Lobsters and crabs are noctur nal and caught best at night. NOTE: You must cook all freshwater crustaceans, mollusks, and fish. Fresh water tends to harbor many dangerous organisms (see Chapter 6 ), animal and human contaminants, and possibly agricultural and industrial pollutants. MOLLUSKS 8-9. This class includes octopuses and freshwater and saltwater shellfish such as snails, clams, mussels, bivalves, barnacles, periwinkles , chitons, and sea urchins ( Figure 8-1 ). You find bivalves similar to our freshwater mussel and terrestri al and aquatic snails worldwide under all water conditions."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":" 71 Figure 8-1. Edible Mollusks 8-10. River snails or freshwater pe riwinkles are plentiful in rivers , streams, and lakes of northern coniferous forests. These snails may be pencil point or globular in shape. 8-11. In fresh water, look for mollusks in the shallows , especially in water with a sandy or muddy bottom. Look for the narrow trails they leave in the mud or for the dark elliptical slit of their open valves. 8-12. Near the sea, look in the tidal pools and th e wet sand. Rocks along beaches or extending as reefs into deeper water often bear clinging shellfish. Sna ils and limpets cling to rocks and seaweed from the low water mark upward. Large snails, called chitons, adhere tightly to rock s above the surf line. 8-13. Mussels usually form dense colonies in ro ck pools, on logs, or at the base of boulders. CAUTION - Mussels may be poisonous in tropical zones du ring the summer! If a noticeable red tide has occurred within 72 hours, do not eat any fish or shellfish from that water source. 8-14. Steam, boil, or bake mollusks in the shell. They make excellent stews in combination with greens and tubers. CAUTION - Do not eat shellfish that are no t covered by water at high tide! FISH 8-15. Fish represent a good source of protein and fat. They offer some distinct advantages to the survivor or evader. They are usually more abundant than mammal wildlife, and the ways to get them are silent. To"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":" 72 be successful at catching fish, you must know their habits. For instan ce, fish tend to feed heavily before a storm. Fish are not likely to feed after a storm wh en the water is muddy and sw ollen. Light often attracts fish at night. When there is a hea vy current, fish will rest in places where there is an eddy, such as near rocks. Fish will also gather where there are d eep pools, under overhanging brush, and in and around submerged foliage, logs, or other ob jects that offer them shelter. 8-16. There are no poisonous freshwater fish. However, the catfis h species has sharp, needlelike protrusions on its dorsal fins and ba rbels. These can inflict painful punc ture wounds that quickly become infected. 8-17. Cook all freshwater fish to kill parasites. As a precaution, also co ok saltwater fish caught within a reef or within the influence of a freshwater source. Any marine life obtained farther out in the sea will not contain parasites because of the saltwater environment. You can eat these raw. 8-18. Most fish encountered are edible. The organs of some species are always poisonous to man; other fish can become toxic because of elements in their di ets. Ciguatera is a form of human poisoning caused by the consumption of subtropical and tropical marine fish which have accumulated naturally occurring toxins through their diet. These toxi ns build up in the fish's tissues. The toxins are known to originate from several algae species that are common to ciguate ra endemic regions in th e lower latitudes. Cooking does not eliminate the toxins; neither does drying, sm oking, or marinating. Marine fish most commonly implicated in ciguatera poisoning in clude the barracudas, jacks, mack erel, triggerfish, snappers, and groupers. Many other species of warm water fishes harbor ciguatera toxins. The occu rrence of toxic fish is sporadic, and not all fish of a given species or from a given locality will be toxic. This explains why red snapper and grouper are a coveted fish off the shores of Florida and the East Coast. While they are a restaurant and fisherman's favorite, and a common fish market choice, they can al so be associated with 100 cases of food poisonings in May 1988, Palm Beach County, Florida. The poisonings resulted in a statewide warning against eating hog fish, grouper, red snapper, amberjack, and barracuda caught at the Dry Tortuga Bank. A major outbreak of ciguatera occurred in Puerto Rico between April and June 1981 prompting a ban on the sale of barracuda, amberjack, and blackjack. Other examples of poisonous saltwater fish are the porcupine fish, cowfish, thorn fish, oilfish, and puffer ( Figure 8-2 ). "},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":" 73 Figure 8-2. Fish With Poisonous Flesh AMPHIBIANS 8-19. Frogs are easily found around bodies of fresh water. Frogs seldom move from the safety of the water's edge. At the first sign of danger, they plunge into the water and bury themselves in the mud and debris. Frogs are characterized by smooth, moist ski n. There are few poisonous species of frogs. Avoid any brightly colored frog or one th at has a distinct \"X\" mark on its ba ck as well as all tree frogs. Do not confuse toads with frogs. Toads may be recognized by their dry, \"warty\" or bumpy skin. They are usually found on land in drier environments. Several species of toads secrete a poisonous substance through their skin as a defense against attack. Therefore, to avoid poisoning, do not handle or eat toads. 8-20. Do not eat salamanders; only about 25 percent of all salamanders are edible, so it is not worth the risk of selecting a poisonous variety. Salamanders are found around the water. They are characterized by smooth, moist skin and have only four toes on each foot. REPTILES 8-21. Reptiles are a good protein so urce and relatively easy to catch. Thorough cooking and hand washing is imperative with reptiles. All reptiles are considered to be carriers of salmonella, which exists naturally on their skin. Turtles and snakes are especially known to infect man. If you are in an u ndernourished state and your immune system is weak, salmonella can be deadly. Cook food thoroughly and be especially fastidious washing your hands after handling any reptile. Lizards are plen tiful in most parts of the world. They may be recognized by their dry, scaly skin. They have five to es on each foot. The only poisonous ones are the Gila monster and the Mexican beaded lizard. Care must be taken when handling and preparing the iguana and the monitor lizard, as they commonly harbor the salmone llal virus in their mouth and teeth. The tail meat is the best tasting and easiest to prepare. 8-22. Turtles are a very good source of meat. There are actually seven di fferent flavors of meat in each snapping turtle. Most of the meat will come from the front and rear shoulder area, although a large turtle may have some on its neck. The box turtle ( Figure 8-3 ) is a commonly encountered turtle that you should not eat. It feeds on poisonous mushrooms and may bu ild up a highly toxic pois on in its flesh. Cooking does not destroy this toxin. Also avoid the hawksbill turtle ( Figure 8-3 ), found in the Atlantic Ocean, because of its poisonous thorax gland. Poisonous snakes, alligators, crocodiles, and large sea turtles present obvious hazards to the survivor. Figure 8-3. Turtles With Poisonous Flesh"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" 74 BIRDS 8-23. All species of birds are edible, although the flavor will vary considerably. The only poisonous bird is the Pitohui, native only to New Guinea. You may skin fish-eating birds to impr ove their taste. As with any wild animal, you must understand birds' common habits to have a realistic chance of capturing them. You can take pigeons, as well as some other species, from their roost at night by hand. During the nesting season, some species will not leave the nest even when approached. Knowing where and when the birds nest makes catching them easier ( Figure 8-4 ). Birds tend to have regular fl yways going from the roost to a feeding area, to water, and so forth. Careful obser vation should reveal where these flyways are and indicate good areas for catching birds in nets stretched across the flyways ( Figure 8-5 ). Roosting sites and waterholes are some of the most promising areas for trapping or snaring. Figure 8-4. Birds' Nesting Places Figure 8-5. Catching Birds in a Net"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" 75 8-24. Nesting birds present another f ood source—eggs. Remove all but two or three eggs from the clutch, marking the ones that you leave. The bird will conti nue to lay more eggs to fill the clutch. Continue removing the fresh eggs, leaving the ones you marked. MAMMALS 8-25. Mammals are excellent protein sources and, for Am ericans, the tastiest f ood source. There are some drawbacks to obtaining mammals. In a hostile environm ent, the enemy may detect any traps or snares placed on land. The amount of injury an animal can inf lict is in direct proporti on to its size. All mammals have teeth and nearly all will bite in self-defense. Even a squirrel can inflict a serious wound and any bite presents a serious risk of infection. Also, any mother can be extremely aggressi ve in defense of her young. Any animal with no route of es cape will fight when cornered. 8-26. All mammals are edible; however, the polar bear and bearded seal have toxic le vels of vitamin A in their livers. The platypus, native to Australia and Tasmania, is an egg-laying, semiaquatic mammal that has poisonous claws on its hind legs . Scavenging mammals, such as the opossum, may carry diseases. TRAPS AND SNARES 8-27. For an unarmed survivor or evader, or when the sound of a rifle shot could be a problem, trapping or snaring wild game is a good alternative. Several well-placed traps have the potential to catch much more game than a man with a rifle is likel y to shoot. To be effective with a ny type of trap or snare, you must— • Be familiar with the species of animal you intend to catch. • Be capable of constructing a proper trap and properly masking your scent. • Not alarm the prey by leaving signs of your presence. 8-28. There are no catchall traps you can set for all animals. You must de termine what species are in the area and set your traps specifica lly with those animals in mind. Look for the following: • Runs and trails. • Tracks. • Droppings. • Chewed or rubbed vegetation. • Nesting or roosting sites. • Feeding and watering areas. 8-29. Position your traps and snares where there is proof that animals pass through. You must determine if it is a \"run\" or a \"trail.\" A trail w ill show signs of use by several species and will be rather distinct. A run is usually smaller and less distinct and will only cont ain signs of one species. You may construct a perfect snare, but it will not catch anythi ng if haphazardly placed in the w oods. Animals have bedding areas, water holes, and feeding areas with tr ails leading from one to another. You must place snares and traps around these areas to be effective. 8-30. If you are in a hostile environment, trap and sn are concealment is important. However, it is equally important not to create a disturbance that will alarm the animal and cause it to avoid the trap. Therefore, if you must dig, remove all fresh dirt fro m the area. Most animals will instin ctively avoid a pitfall-type trap. Prepare the various parts of a trap or snare away from the site, carry them in, and set them up. Such actions make it easier to avoid di sturbing the local vegetation, ther eby alerting the prey. Do not use"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" 76 freshly cut, live vegetation to construct a trap or sn are. Freshly cut vegetation will \"bleed\" sap that has an odor the prey will be able to smell. It is an alarm signal to the animal. 8-31. You must remove or mask the human scent on and around the trap you set. Although birds do not have a developed sense of smell, nearly all mammals depend on smell even more than on sight. Even the slightest human scent on a trap will alarm the prey a nd cause it to avoid the area. Actually removing the scent from a trap is difficult but masking it is re latively easy. Use the fluid from the gall and urine bladders of previous kills. Do not use human urine. M ud, particularly from an area with plenty of rotting vegetation, is also good. Use it to coat your hands when handling the trap and to coat the trap when setting it. In nearly all parts of the world, animals know the smell of burned vegetation and smoke. It is only when a fire is actually burning that they beco me alarmed. Therefore, smoking the trap parts is an effective means to mask your scent. If one of the a bove techniques is not practical, and if time permits, allow a trap to weather for a few days and then set it. Do not handle a trap wh ile it is weathering. When you position the trap, camouflage it as naturally as possible to prev ent detection by the enemy and to avoid alarming the prey. 8-32. Traps or snares placed on a trail or run should use funneling or channeliza tion. To build a channel, construct a funnel-shaped barrier exte nding from the sides of the trail to ward the trap, with the narrowest part nearest the trap. Channelization should be incons picuous to avoid alerting the prey. As the animal gets to the trap, it cannot turn left or right and co ntinues into the trap. Few wild animals will back up, preferring to face the direction of travel. Channelizat ion does not have to be an impassable barrier. You only have to make it inconvenient fo r the animal to go over or through th e barrier. For best effect, the channelization should reduce the trail's width to just slightly wider than th e targeted animal's body. Maintain this constriction at least as far back from the trap as the animal's body length, then begin the widening toward the mouth of the funnel. USE OF BAIT 8-33. Baiting a trap or snare increa ses your chances of catching an an imal. When catching fish, you must bait nearly all the devices. Success with an unbaited trap depends on its placement in a good location. A baited trap can actually draw animals to it. The bait should be something the animal knows. However, this bait should not be so readily available in the imme diate area that the animal can get it close by. For example, baiting a trap with corn in the middle of a cornfield would not be likel y to work. Likewise, if corn is not grown in the region, a corn-baited trap may arouse an anim al's curiosity and keep it alerted while it ponders the strange food. Under such circumstances it may not go for the bait. One bait that works well on small mammals is the peanut butter from a meal, ready-to-eat (M RE) ration. Salt is also a good bait. When using such baits, scatter bits of it ar ound the trap to give the pr ey a chance to sample it and develop a craving for it. The animal will then overcome some of its caution before it gets to the trap. 8-34. If you set and bait a trap for on e species but another species takes the bait without being caught, try to determine what the animal was. Then set a proper trap for that animal, using the same bait. NOTE: Once you have successfully trapped an animal, you will not only gain confidence in your ability, you will also have resupplied yourself with bait for several more traps. CONSTRUCTION"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":" 77 8-35. Traps and snares crush, choke, hang, or entangle the prey. A single trap or snare will commonly incorporate two or more of these pr inciples. The mechanisms that provi de power to the trap are usually very simple. The struggling victim, the force of gravit y, or a bent sapling's tension provides the power. 8-36. The heart of any trap or snare is the trigger. When planning a tr ap or snare, ask yourself how it should affect the prey, what is the source of power, and what will be the most efficient trigger. Your answers will help you devise a specific trap for a speci fic species. Traps are desi gned to catch and hold or to catch and kill. Snares are traps that inco rporate a noose to accomplish either function. Simple Snare 8-37. A simple snare ( Figure 8-6 ) consists of a noose pl aced over a trail or den hole and attached to a firmly planted stake. If the noose is some type of co rdage placed upright on a game trail, use small twigs or blades of grass to hold it up. Filaments from spider webs are ex cellent for holding nooses open. Make sure the noose is large enough to pass freely over the an imal's head. As the animal continues to move, the noose tightens around its neck. The more the animal st ruggles, the tighter the noose gets. This type of snare usually does not kill the animal . If you use cordage, it may loosen enough to slip off the animal's neck. Wire is therefore the best choice for a simple snare. Figure 8-6. Simple Snare Drag Noose 8-38. Use a drag noose on an animal run ( Figure 8-7 ). Place forked sticks on either side of the run and lay a sturdy crossmember across them. Tie the noose to the crossmember and hang it at a height above the animal's head. (Nooses designed to catch by the head should never be low enough for the prey to step into with a foot.) As the noose tightens around the animal's neck, the animal pulls the crossmember from the forked sticks and drags it along. The surrounding ve getation quickly catches the crossmember and the animal becomes entangled."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":" 78 Figure 8-7. Drag Noose Twitch-Up 8-39. A twitch-up is a suppl e sapling that, when bent over and s ecured with a triggering device, will provide power to a variety of snares. Select a hickory or other hardwood sapling along the trail. A twitch- up will work much faster and with more for ce if you remove all the branches and foliage. Twitch-Up Snare 8-40. A simple twitch-up snare uses two fork ed sticks, each with a long and short leg (Figure 8-8 ). Bend the twitch-up and mark the trail belo w it. Drive the long leg of one fork ed stick firmly into the ground at that point. Ensure the cut on the short leg of this s tick is parallel to the gr ound. Tie the long leg of the remaining forked stick to a piece of cordage secured to the twitch-up. Cut the shor t leg so that it catches on the short leg of the other forked stick. Extend a noose over the trail. Set the trap by bending the twitch- up and engaging the short legs of the forked sticks. Wh en an animal catches its head in the noose, it pulls the forked sticks apart, allowing the twitch-up to spring up and hang the prey. NOTE: Do not use green sticks for the trigger. The sap that oozes out could glue them together. Figure 8-8. Twitch-Up Snare"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":" 79 Squirrel Pole 8-41. A squirrel pole is a long pole placed against a tr ee in an area showing a lot of squirrel activity (Figure 8-9 ). Place several wire nooses along the top and side s of the pole so that a squirrel trying to go up or down the pole will have to pass through one or more of them. Position the nooses (5 to 6 centimeters [2 to 2 1/4-inches] in diameter) about 2.5 centimeters (1 inch) off the pole. Place the top and bottom wire nooses 45 centimeters (18 inches) from th e top and bottom of the pol e to prevent the squirrel from getting its feet on a solid surface. If this happen s, the squirrel will chew through the wire. Squirrels are naturally curious. After an initia l period of caution, they will try to go up or down the pole and will be caught in the noose. The struggling animal will soon fa ll from the pole and strangle. Other squirrels will soon be drawn to the commotion. In this way, you can catch several squirrels. You can emplace multiple poles to increase the catch. Figure. 8-9. Squirrel Pole Ojibwa Bird Pole 8-42. An Ojibwa bird pole is a snare that has been used by Native Americans for centuries ( Figure 8-10 ). To be effective, it should be placed in a relatively ope n area away from tall trees. For best results, pick a spot near feeding areas, dusting ar eas, or watering holes. Cut a pole 1.8 to 2.1 meters (6 to 7 feet) long and trim away all limbs and foliage. Do not use resinous wood such as pine. Sharpen the upper end to a point, then drill a small-diameter hole 5 to 7.5 centimeters (2 to 3 inches) down from the top. Cut a small stick 10 to 15 centimeters (4 to 6 inches) long and shape one end so that it will almost fit into the hole. This is the perch. Plant the long pole in the ground with the poi nted end up. Tie a small we ight, about equal to the weight of the targeted sp ecies, to a length of cordage. Pass the free end of the cordage through the hole, and tie a slip noose that covers the perch. Tie a si ngle overhand knot in the cordage and place the perch against the hole. Allow the cordage to slip throug h the hole until the overhand knot rests against the pole and the top of the perch. The tension of the overh and knot against the pole a nd perch will hold the perch in position. Spread the noose over th e perch, ensuring it covers the perc h and drapes over on both sides. Most birds prefer to rest on some thing above ground and will land on th e perch. As soon as the bird lands, the perch will fall, releasing the overhand knot and allowing the weight to drop. The noose will tighten around the bird's feet, capturing it. If the weight is too heavy, it will cu t off the bird's feet, allowing it to escape. Another variation would be to use spring tension such as a tr ee branch in place of the weight."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":" 80 Figure 8-10. Ojibwa Bird Pole Noosing Wand 8-43. A noose stick or \"noosing wand\" is useful for capturing roosting birds or small mammals ( Figure 8- 11 ). It requires a patient operator. This wand is more a weapon than a trap. It consists of a pole (as long as you can effectively handle) with a slip noose of wire or stiff cordage at the small end. To catch an animal, you slip the noose over the neck of a roosting bird a nd pull it tight. You can also place it over a den hole and hide in a nearby blind. When the animal emerge s from the den, you jerk the pole to tighten the noose and thus capture the animal. Carry a stout club to kill the prey. Figure 8-11. Noosing Wand Treadle Spring Snare 8-44. Use a treadle snare against small game on a trail ( Figure 8-12 ). Dig a shallow hole in the trail. Then drive a forked stick (fork down) into the ground on each side of the hole on the same side of the trail. Select two fairly straight sticks that span the two forks. Position these tw o sticks so that their ends engage the forks. Place several sticks over the hole in th e trail by positioning one end over the lower horizontal stick and the other on the ground on the other side of the hole. Cover the hole with enough sticks so that the prey must step on at least one of them to set off the snare. Tie one end of a piece of cordage to a twitch-up or to a weight suspended over a tree limb. Bend the twitch-up or raise the suspended weight to determine where you will tie the trig ger. The trigger should be about 5 centimeters (2 inches) long. Form a noose with the other end of the cordage. Route and spread the noos e over the top of the sticks over the hole. Place the trigger stick against the horizontal sticks and route the co rdage behind the sticks so that the tension of the power source will hold it in place. Adjust the bottom horizontal stick so that it will barely hold against the trigger. As the animal places its foot on a stick across the hole, the bottom horizontal stick moves down, releasing the trigger and allowing th e noose to catch the animal by the foot. Because of the disturbance on the trail, an animal will be wary. You must ther efore use channeli zation. To increase the effectiveness of this trap, a small bait well may be dug into the bottom of the hole. Place some bait in the bottom of the hole to lure the animal to the snare."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":" 81 Figure 8-12. Treadle Spring Snare Figure 4 Deadfall 8-45. The figure 4 deadfall is a trigger used to drop a weight onto a prey and crush it ( Figure 8-13 ). The type of weight used may vary, but it should be hea vy enough to kill or incapacitate the prey immediately. Construct the figure 4 using three not ched sticks. These notches hold th e sticks together in a figure 4 pattern when under tension. Practice making this trigger beforehand; it requires close tolerances and precise angles in its construction."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":" 82 Figure 8-13. Figure 4 Deadfall Paiute Deadfall 8-46. The Paiute deadfall is similar to the figure 4 but uses a piece of cordage and a catch stick ( Figure 8- 14 ). It has the advantage of being easier to set than the figure 4. Ti e one end of a piece of cordage to the lower end of the diagonal stick. Tie the other end of the cordage to another stick about 5 centimeters (2 inches) long. This stick is the catc h stick. Bring the cord halfway around the vertical stick with the catch stick at a 90-degree angle. Place the bait stick with one end against the drop weight, or a peg driven into the ground, and the other against the catch stick. When a prey disturbs the bait stick, it falls free, releasing the catch stick. As the diagonal s tick flies up, the weight falls, crus hing the prey. To increase the effectiveness of this trap , a small bait well may be dug into the bottom of the hole. Place some bait in the bottom of the hole to lure the animals to the snare. Figure 8-14. Paiute Deadfall Bow Trap 8-47. A bow trap is one of the deadliest traps ( Figure 8-15 ). It is dangerous to man as well as animals. To construct this trap, build a bow and anchor it to the ground with pegs. Adjust the aiming point as you anchor the bow. Lash a toggle stick to the trigger s tick. Two upright sticks driv en into the ground hold the trigger stick in place at a point where the toggle st ick will engage the pulled bowstring. Place a catch stick between the toggle stick and a stake driven into the ground. Tie a trip wire or cordage to the catch stick"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":" 83 and route it around stakes a nd across the game trail wh ere you tie it off (as in Figure 8-15 ). When the prey trips the trip wire, the bow looses an arrow into it. A notch in the bow serves to help aim the arrow. Figure 8-15. Bow Trap WARNING This is a lethal trap. Approach it with caution and from the rear only! Pig Spear Shaft 8-48. To construct the pig spear shaft, select a stout pole about 2.5 meters (8 feet) long ( Figure 8-16 ). At the smaller end, firmly lash several small stakes. Lash the large end tightly to a tree along the game trail. Tie a length of cordage to another tree across the trail. Tie a sturdy, sm ooth stick to the other end of the cord. From the first tree, tie a trip wire or cord low to the ground, stretc h it across the trail, and tie it to a catch stick. Make a slip ring from vi nes or other suitable material. Enci rcle the trip wi re and the smooth stick with the slip ring. Emplace one end of another smooth stick within the slip ring and its other end against the second tree. Pull the smaller end of the spear shaft across the tra il and position it between the short cord and the smooth stick. As the animal trips th e trip wire, the catch stick pulls the slip ring off the smooth sticks, releasing the spear shaf t that springs across the trail and im pales the prey against the tree. Figure 8-16. Pig Spear Shaft WARNING - This is a lethal trap. Approach it with caution and from the rear only! Bottle Trap"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":" 84 8-49. A bottle trap is a simple trap for mice and voles ( Figure 8-17 ). Dig a hole 30 to 45 centimeters (12 to 18 inches) deep that is wider at the bottom than at the top. Make the top of the hole as small as possible. Place a piece of bark or wood over the ho le with small stones under it to hold it up 2.5 to 5 centimeters (1 to 2 inches) off the ground. Mice or voles will hide under the cove r to escape danger and fall into the hole. They cannot climb out because of the wall's backward slope. Use caution when checking this trap; it is an excellent hiding place for snakes. Figure 8-17. Bottle Trap KILLING DEVICES 8-50. There are several killing device s that you can construct to help you obtain small game to help you survive. The rabbit stick, the spear, the bow and arrow, and the sling are such devices. RABBIT STICK 8-51. One of the simplest and most ef fective killing devices is a stout stick as l ong as your arm, from fingertip to shoulder, called a \"r abbit stick.\" You can th row it either overhand or sidearm and with considerable force. It is best thrown so that it flies sideways, increasing the chance of hitting the target. It is very effective against small game that stops and freezes as a defense. SPEAR 8-52. You can make a spear to kill small game and to fish. Jab with the spear—do not throw it. Paragraph 8-67 explains spearfishing. BOW AND ARROW 8-53. A good bow is the result of many hours of work. Y ou can construct a suitable short-term bow fairly easily. When it loses its spring or breaks, you can repl ace it. Select a hardwood stick about 1 meter (3 feet) long that is free of knots or limbs. Carefully scrape the large e nd down until it has the same pull as the small end. Careful examination will show the natural curve of the stick. Always scrape from the side that faces you, or the bow will break the first time you pull it. Dead, dry wood is preferable to green wood. To increase the pull, lash a second bow to the fi rst, front to front, forming an \"X\" when viewed from the side. Attach the tips of the bows with cordage and only use a bowstring on one bow."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":" 85 8-54. Select arrows from the straight est dry sticks available. The arrows should be about half as long as the bow. Scrape each shaft smooth all around. You will pr obably have to straighten the shaft. You can bend an arrow straight by heating th e shaft over hot coals. Do not allow the shaft to scorch or burn. Hold the shaft straight until it cools. 8-55. You can make arrowheads from bone, glass, metal, or pieces of rock. You can also sharpen and fire- harden the end of the shaft. Fire hardening is actually a misnomer. To fire-harden wood, hold it over hot coals or plunge it deep under the co als in the ashes, being careful not to burn or scorch the wood. The purpose of fire hardening is to harden the wood by drying the moisture out of it. 8-56. You must notch the ends of the arrows for the bowstring. Cut or file th e notch; do not split it. Fletching (adding feathers to the notched end of an arrow) improve s the arrow's flight characteristics. Fletching is recommended but not n ecessary on a field-expedient arrow. SLING 8-57. You can make a sling by tying two pieces of cord age, each about 60 centim eters (24 inches) long, at opposite ends of a palm-sized piece of leather or clot h. Place a rock in the clot h and wrap one cord around your middle finger and hold in your palm. Hold the other cord between your forefinger and thumb. To throw the rock, spin the sling several times in a circle and release the co rd between your thumb and forefinger. Practice to gain proficiency. The sling is very effectiv e against small game. FISHING DEVICES 8-58. You can make your own fishhooks, nets, and traps. The paragraphs below discuss several methods to obtain fish. IMPROVISED FISHHOOKS 8-59. You can make field-expedient fishhooks from pins, needles, wire, small nails, or any piece of metal. You can also use wood, bone, coconut shell, thorns, flint, seashell, or tortoise shell. You can also make fishhooks from any combination of these items ( Figure 8-18 ). Figure 8-18. Improvised Fishhooks 8-60. To make a wooden hook, cut a piece of hardwood about 2.5 centimeters (1 inch) long and about 6 millimeters (1/4 inch) in diameter to form the shank. Cut a notch in one end in which to place the point. Place the point (piece of bone, wire, nail) in the notch. Ho ld the point in the notch and tie securely so that it does not move out of pos ition. This is a fairly large hook. To make smaller hooks, use smaller material."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":" 86 8-61. A gorge or skewer is a small shaft of wood, bone, metal, or other material. It is sharp on both ends and notched in the middle where you tie cordag e. Bait the gorge by placing a piece of bait on it lengthwise. When the fish swallows the bait, it also swallows the gorge. If you ar e tending the fishing line when the fish bites, do not attempt to pull on the line to set the hook as you would with a conventional hook. Allow the fish to swallow the bait to get the gorge as far down its throat before the gorge sets itself. STAKEOUT 8-62. A stakeout is a fish ing device you can use in a hostile environment ( Figure 8-19 ). To construct a stakeout, drive two supple saplings in to the bottom of the lake, pond, or st ream with their tops just below the water surface. Tie a cord between them just slightly below the surface. Tie two short cords with hooks or gorges to this cord, ensuring that they cannot wrap around the poles or each other. They should also not slip along the long cord. Bait the hooks or gorges. Figure 8-19. Stakeout GILL NET 8-63. If a gill net is not available, you can make one using parachute suspension line or similar material (Figure 8-20 ). Remove the core lines from the suspensi on line and tie the casi ng between two trees. Attach several core lines to the casing by doubling th em over and tying them with prusik knots or girth hitches. These lines should be six times the desi red depth of the net (for example, a 6-foot [180- centimeter] piece of string girth-hitched over the casi ng will give you two 3-foot [90-centimeter] pieces, which after completing the net, will provide a 1-foot [30-centimeter] d eep net). The length of the desired net and the size of the mesh determine the number of core lines used and the space between them. The recommended size of the spaces in the net mesh is a bout 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) square. Starting at one end of the casing, tie the second and the third core lines together usi ng an overhand knot. Then tie the fourth and fifth, sixth and seventh, and so on, until you reach the last core line. You should now have all core lines tied in pairs with a single core line hangi ng at each end. Start the sec ond row with the first core line, tie it to the second, the th ird to the fourth, and so on."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":" 87 Figure 8-20. Making a Gill Net 8-64. To keep the rows even and to regulate the size of the mesh, tie a guideline to the trees. Position the guideline on the opposite side of the net you are working on. Move th e guideline down after completing each row. The lines will always hang in pairs and you always tie a cord from one pair to a cord from an adjoining pair. Continue tying rows until the net is the desired width. Thread a suspension line casing along the bottom of the net to strengthen it. Use the gill net as shown in Figure 8-21 . Angling the gill net will help to reduce the amount of debris that may accumulate in the net. Be sure to check it frequently. Figure 8-21. Setting a Gill Net in the Stream FISH TRAPS 8-65. You may trap fish using several methods ( Figure 8-22 ). Fish baskets are one method. You construct them by lashing several sticks togeth er with vines into a funnel shape. You close the top, leaving a hole large enough for the fish to swim through."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":" 88 Figure 8-22. Various Types of Fish Traps 8-66. You can also use traps to catch saltwater fis h, as schools regularly appr oach the shore with the incoming tide and often move parallel to the shore. Pi ck a location at high tide and build the trap at low tide. On rocky shores, use natural rock pools. On co ral islands, use natural pool s on the surface of reefs by blocking the openings as the tide r ecedes. On sandy shores, use sandbars and the ditches they enclose. Build the trap as a low stone wall extending outward in to the water and forming an angle with the shore. SPEARFISHING 8-67. If you are near shallow water (about waist deep ) where the fish are la rge and plentiful, you can spear them. To make a spear, cut a long, straight sapling ( Figure 8-23 ). Sharpen the end to a point or attach a knife, jagged piece of bone, or sharpened meta l. You can also make a spear by splitting the shaft a few inches down from the end and inserting a piece of wood to act as a spreader. You then sharpen the two separated halves to points. To sp ear fish, find an area where fish eith er gather or where there is a fish run. Place the spear point into the water and slowly move it toward the fish. Then, with a sudden push, impale the fish on the stream bottom. Do not try to lif t the fish with the spear, as it with probably slip off and you will lose it; hold the spear with one hand and grab and hold the fish with the other. Do not throw the spear, especially if th e point is a knife. You cannot afford to lose a knife in a su rvival situation. Be alert to the problems caused by light refraction when looking at objects in the water. You must aim lower than the object, usually at the bo ttom of the fish, to hit your mark."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":" 89 Figure 8-23. Types of Spear Points CHOP FISHING 8-68. At night, in an area with high fish density, you can use a light to attract fish. Then, armed with a machete or similar weapon, you can gather fish using the back side of the blade to strike them. Do not use the sharp side as you will cut them in two pieces and end up losing some of the fish. FISH POISON 8-69. Another way to catch fish is by using pois on. Poison works quickly. It allows you to remain concealed while it takes effect. It al so enables you to catch several fi sh at one time. When using fish poison, be sure to gather all of the affected fis h, because many dead fish floating downstream could arouse suspicion. Some plants that grow in warm regi ons of the world contain ro tenone, a substance that stuns or kills cold-blooded animals but does not harm persons who eat the animals. The best place to use rotenone, or rotenone-producing plants, is in ponds or the headwaters of small streams containing fish. Rotenone works quickly on fish in water 21 degrees C (70 degrees F) or above. The fish rise helplessly to the surface. It works slowly in water 10 to 21 degrees C (50 to 70 degrees F) and is ineffective in water below 10 degrees C (50 degrees F). The following plants, used as indicated, will stun or kill fish: • Anamirta cocculus (Figure 8-24 ). This woody vine grows in sout hern Asia and on islands of the South Pacific. Crush the bean-shaped seeds and throw them in the water. • Croton tiglium (Figure 8-24 ). This shrub or small tree grows in waste areas on islands of the South Pacific. It bears seeds in three angled capsules. Crush the seeds and throw them into the water. • Barringtonia (Figure 8-24 ). These large trees grow near the sea in Malaya and parts of Polynesia. They bear a fleshy one-seeded fruit. Crush th e seeds and bark and throw into the water. • Derris eliptica (Figure 8-24 ). This large genus of tropical sh rubs and woody vines is the main source of commercially produced rotenone. Grind the roots into a powder and mix with water. Throw a large quantity of the mixture into the water. • Duboisia ( Figure 8-24 ). This shrub grows in Australia and bears white clusters of flowers and berrylike fruit. Crush the plants and throw them into the water. • Tephrosia (Figure 8-24 ). This species of small shrubs , which bears beanlike pods, grows throughout the tropics. Crush or br uise bundles of leaves and stems and throw them into the water."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":" 90 Figure 8-24. Fish-Poisoning Plants • Lime. You can get lime from commercial sources and in agricultural areas that use large quantities of it. You may produce your own by burning coral or seashells. Throw the lime into the water. • Nut husks. Crush green husks from butternuts or black walnuts. Throw the husks into the water. COOKING AND STORAGE OF FISH AND GAME 8-70. You must know how to prepare fish and game for cooking and storage in a survival situation. Improper cleaning or storage can re sult in inedible fish or game. FISH 8-71. Do not eat fish that appears spoiled. Cooking does not ensure that spoiled fish will be edible. Signs of spoilage are— • Sunken eyes. • Peculiar odor. • Suspicious color. (Gills should be red to pink. Scales should be a pronounced shade of gray, not faded.) • Dents that stay in the fish's flesh after pressed with your thumb. • Slimy, rather than moist or wet, body. • Sharp or peppery taste."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":" 91 8-72. Eating spoiled or rotten fish may cause diarrhea, nausea, cramps, vomiting, itching, paralysis, or a metallic taste in the mouth. These symptoms appear suddenly, 1 to 6 hours after eating. Induce vomiting if symptoms appear. 8-73. Fish spoils quickly after death, especially on a hot day. Prepare fish for eating as soon as possible after catching it. Cut out the gills an d the large blood vessels that lie near the spine. Gut fish that are more than 10 centimeters (4 inches) long. Scale or skin the fish. 8-74. You can impale a whole fish on a stick and cook it over an open fire. However, boiling the fish with the skin on is the best way to get the most food va lue. The fats and oil are under the skin and, by boiling, you can save the juices for broth. You can use any of the methods used to cook plant food to cook fish. Pack fish into a ball of clay and bury it in the coals of a fire until the clay hardens. Break open the clay ball to get to the cooked fish. Fish is done when the meat flakes off. If you plan to keep the fish for later, smoke or fry it. To prepare fish for smoking, cut off the head and remove the backbone. SNAKES 8-75. To skin a snake, first cut off its head, to in clude 10 to 15 centimeters (4 to 6 inches) behind the head. This will ensure you remove the venom sac, which is located at the base of the head. Bury the sac to prevent further contact. Then cut the skin down the body 2 to 4 centimeters (1 to 1 1/2 inches). Peel the skin back, then grasp the sk in in one hand and the body in the other and pull apart ( Figure 8-25 ). On large, bulky snakes it may be necessary to slit the belly skin. Cook snakes in the same manner as small game. Remove the entrails and discard. Cut the snake into small sections and boil or roast it. Figure 8-25. Cleaning a Snake BIRDS 8-76. After killing the bird, remove its feathers by either plucking or skinning. Remember, skinning removes some of the food value. Open up the body cav ity and remove the entrai ls, saving the craw (in seed-eating birds), heart, and liver. Cut off the f eet. Cook by boiling or roasting over a spit. Before cooking scavenger birds, boil them at least 20 minutes to kill parasites. SKINNING AND BUTCHERING GAME"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":" 92 8-77. Bleed the animal by cutting its throat. If possible, clean the carca ss near a stream. Place the carcass belly up and split the hide from throat to tail, cutting around all sexual organs ( Figure 8-26 ). Remove the musk glands at points A and B to avoid tainting th e meat. For smaller mammals, cut the hide around the body and insert two fingers under the hide on both sides of the cut and pull both pieces off ( Figure 8-27 ). NOTE: When cutting the hide, insert th e knife blade under the skin and turn the bl ade up so that only the hide gets cut. This will also preven t cutting hair and getting it on the meat.

Do not forget the chest cavity. For larger ga me, cut the gullet away from the diaphragm. Roll the entrails out of the body. Cut around the anus, then reach into the lower abdominal cavity, grasp the lower intestine, and pull to remove. Remove the urine bl adder by pinching it off and cutting it below the fingers. If you spill urine on the meat, wash it to avoid tainting the meat. Save the heart and liver. Cut these open and inspect for signs of worms or other parasites. Also inspect the liver's color; it could indicate a diseased animal. The liver's surface should be smooth and wet and its color deep red or purple. If the liver appears diseased, discard it. However, a diseased liver does not indicate you cannot eat the muscle tissue. 8-79. Cut along each leg from above the foot to th e previously made body cut. Remove the hide by pulling it away from the carcass, cutting the connective tissue where necessary. Cut off the head and feet. 8-80. Cut larger game into manageable pieces. First, slice the muscle tissue conn ecting the front legs to the body. There are no bones or joints connecting the front legs to the body on four-legged animals. Cut the hindquarters off where they join the body. You must cut around a large bone at the top of the leg and cut to the ball-and-socket hip joint. Cut the ligaments around the jo int and bend it back to separate it."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":" 93 Remove the large muscles (the tenderloi n or \"backstrap\") that lie on either side of the spine. Separate the ribs from the backbone. There is less work and less wear on your knife if you break the ribs first, then cut through the breaks. 8-81. Boil large meat pieces or cook them over a spit. You can stew or boil smaller pieces, particularly those that remain attached to bone after the initial butch ering, as soup or broth. You can cook body organs such as the heart, liver, pancreas , spleen, and kidneys using the same methods as for muscle meat. You can also cook and eat the brai n. Cut the tongue out, skin it, boil it until tender, and eat it. SMOKING MEAT 8-82. To smoke meat, prepare an enclosure around a fire Figure 8-28 ). Two ponchos snapped together will work. The fire does not need to be big or hot. The intent is to produce smoke and heat, not flame. Do not use resinous wood because its smoke will ruin the meat. Use hardwoods to produce good smoke. The wood should be somewhat green. If it is too dry, soak it. Cut the meat into thin slices, no more than 6 millimeters (about 1/4 inch) thick, and drape them over a framework. Make sure none of the meat touches another piece. Keep the poncho encl osure around the meat to hold the smoke and keep a close watch on the fire. Do not let the fire get too hot. Meat smoked overnight in this manner will last about 1 week. Two days of continuous smoking will preserve the meat for 2 to 4 weeks. Properly smoked meat will look like a dark, curled, brittle stick and you can eat it without further cooking. You can also use a pit to smoke meat ( Figure 8-29 ). Figure 8-28. Tepee Smoker"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" 94 Figure 8-29. Smokin g Meat Over a Pit DRYING MEAT 8-83. To preserve meat by drying, cut it into 6-millimeter (1/4-inch) strips with the grain. Hang the meat strips on a rack in a sunny location with good airflow. Keep the strips ou t of the reach of animals. Cover the strips to keep off blowflies. Allow the meat to dry thoroughly befo re eating. Properly dried meat will have a dry, crisp texture and will not feel cool to the touch. OTHER PRESERVATION METHODS 8-84. You can also preserve meats using the freezing or brine and salt methods. In cold climates, you can freeze and keep meat indefinitely. Freezing is not a mean s of preparing meat. You must still cook it before eating. You can also preserve meat by soaking it thoroughly in a saltwater solution. The solution must cover the meat. You can use salt by itself but make sure you wash off the salt before cooking. Chapter 9 Survival Use of Plants After having solved the problems of finding water, shel ter, and animal food, you will have to consider the use of plants you can eat. In a survival situation you should always be on the lookout for familiar wild foods and live off the land whenever possible. You must not count on being able to go for days without food as some sources would suggest. Even in the most static survival situation, maintaining health th rough a complete and nutritious diet is essential to maintaining strength and peace of mind. Nature can provide you with food th at will let you survive almost any ordeal, if you don't eat the wrong plant. You must therefore learn as much as possi ble beforehand about the flora of the region where you will be operating. Plants can provide you with medici nes in a survival situation. Plants can supply you with weapons and raw materials to c onstruct shelters and bu ild fires. Plants can even provide you with chemicals for poisoning fish, preserving animal hides, and for camouflaging yourself and your equipment. NOTE: You will find illustrations of the pl ants described in this chapter in Appendixes B and C . EDIBILITY OF PLANTS"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":" 95 9-1. Plants are valuable sources of food because they are widely avai lable, easily procured, and, in the proper combinations, can meet all your nutritional needs. WARNING - The critical factor in using plants for food is to avoid acc idental poisoning. Eat only those plants you can positively identify and you know are safe to eat. 9-2. Absolutely identify plants be fore using them as food. Poison hemlock has killed people who mistook it for its relatives, wild carrots and wild parsnips. 9-3. You may find yourself in a situa tion where you have had the chance to learn the plant life of the region in which you must survive. In this case you can use the Universal Edib ility Test to determine which plants you can eat and which to avoid. 9-4. It is important to be able to recognize both cultivat ed and wild edible plants in a survival situation. Most of the information in this chapter is directed toward identifying wild plants because information relating to cultivated plants is more readily available. 9-5. Consider the following when co llecting wild plants for food: • Plants growing near homes and occupied buildin gs or along roadsides may have been sprayed with pesticides. Wash these plants thoroughly. In more highly developed countries with many automobiles, avoid roadside plants, if possible, due to contamination from exhaust emissions. • Plants growing in contaminated water or in water containing Giardia lamblia and other parasites are contaminated themselves. Boil or disinfect them. • Some plants develop extremely dangerous funga l toxins. To lessen the chance of accidental poisoning, do not eat any fruit that is starting to spoil or is sh owing signs of mildew or fungus. • Plants of the same species may differ in thei r toxic or subtoxic com pounds content because of genetic or environmental factors. One example of this is the foliage of the common chokecherry. Some chokecherry plants have high concentrations of deadly cyanide compounds but others have low concentrations or none. Horses have died fr om eating wilted wild ch erry leaves. Avoid any weed, leaves, or seeds with an almondlike scen t, a characteristic of the cyanide compounds. • Some people are more susceptible to gastric distress (from plants) than others. If you are sensitive in this way, avoid unknown wild plants. If you are extremely sensitive to poison ivy, avoid products from this family, including any parts from sumacs, mangoes, and cashews. • Some edible wild plants, such as acorns and water lily rhizomes, are bitter. These bitter substances, usually tannin compounds, make them unpalatable. Boiling them in several changes of water will usually remove these bitter properties. • Many valuable wild plants have high concentrations of oxalate compounds, also known as oxalic acid. Oxalates produce a sharp burning sensation in your mouth and throat and damage the kidneys. Baking, roasting, or drying us ually destroys these oxalate crys tals. The corm (bulb) of the jack-in-the-pulpit is known as the \"Indian turnip,\" but you can eat it only after removing these crystals by slow baking or by drying. WARNING - Do not eat mushrooms in a survival situ ation! The only way to tell if a mushroom is edible is by positive identification. There is no room for experimentatio n. Symptoms caused by the most dangerous mushrooms affecting the central nervous system may not show up until several days after ingestion. By that time, it is too late to reverse their effects. "},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":" 96 PLANT IDENTIFICATION 9-6. You identify plants, other than by memorizing pa rticular varieties through familiarity, by using such factors as leaf shape and margin, leaf arrangements, and root structure. 9-7. The basic leaf margins ( Figure 9-1 ) are toothed, lobed, and toothless or smooth. Figure 9-1. Leaf Margins 9-8. These leaves may be lance-shaped, elliptic al, egg-shaped, oblong, wedge -shaped, triangular, long- pointed, or top-shaped ( Figure 9-2 ). Figure 9-2. Leaf Shapes 9-9. The basic types of leaf arrangements ( Figure 9-3 ) are opposite, alternate, compound, simple, and basal rosette."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":" 97 Figure 9-3. Leaf Arrangements 9-10. The basic types of root structures are the ta proot, tuber, bulb, rhizome, clove, corm, and crown (Figure 9-4 ). Bulbs are familiar to us as onions and, when sliced in half, will show concentric rings. Cloves are those bulblike structures that remind us of garlic and will separate into small pieces when broken apart. This characteristic separates wild oni ons from wild garlic. Taproots resemble carrots and may be single-rooted or branched, but usually only one plant stalk arises from each root. Tubers are like potatoes and daylilies. You will find these structures eith er on strings or in clusters underneath the parent plants. Rhizomes are large creeping rootstock or underground stems. Many plants arise from the \"eyes\" of these roots. Corms are similar to bulbs but are solid when cut rather than posse ssing rings. A crown is the type of root structure found on plants such as asparagus. Crowns look much like a mophead under the soil's surface. Figure 9-4. Root Structures 9-11. Learn as much as possible about the unique ch aracteristics of plants you intend to use for food. Some plants have both edible and poisonous parts. Ma ny are edible only at ce rtain times of the year. Others may have poisonous relativ es that look very similar to th e varieties you can eat or use for medicine."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":" 98 UNIVERSAL EDIBILITY TEST 9-12. There are many plants throughout the world. Tas ting or swallowing even a small portion of some can cause severe discomfort, extrem e internal disorders, and even death. Therefore, if you have the slightest doubt about a plant's edibilit y, apply the Universal Edibility Test ( Figure 9-5 ) before eating any portion of it. 1. Test only one part of a potential food plant at a time. 2. Separate the plant into its basic component s—leaves, stems, roots, buds, and flowers. 3. Smell the food for strong or acid odors. Remember, smell alone does not indicate a plant is edible or inedible. 4. Do not eat for 8 hours before starting the test. 5. During the 8 hours you abstain from eating, test for contact poisoni ng by placing a piece of the plant part you are testing on the inside of your elbow or wrist. Usually 15 minutes is enough time to allow for a reaction. 6. During the test period, take nothing by mouth except purified wa ter and the plant part you are testing. 7. Select a small portion of a single part and prepare it the way you plan to eat it. 8. Before placing the prepared plant part in your m outh, touch a small portion (a pinch) to the outer surface of your lip to test for burning or itching. 9. If after 3 minutes there is no reaction on your lip, place the plant part on your tongue, holding it there for 15 minutes. 10. If there is no reac tion, thoroughly chew a pinch and hold it in your mouth for 15 minutes. Do not swallow. 11. If no burning, itching, numbing, stinging, or other irrita tion occurs during the 15 minutes, swallow the food. 12. Wait 8 hours. If any ill effects occur during this period, induce vom iting and drink a lot of water. 13. If no ill effects occur, eat 0.25 cup of the same plant part prepared the same way. Wait another 8 hours. If no ill effects occur, the plant part as prepared is safe for eating. CAUTION Test all parts of the plant for edibility, as some pl ants have both edible and inedible parts. Do not assume that a part that proved edible when cooked is also edible when raw. Test the part raw to ensure edibility before eating raw. The same pa rt or plant may produce varying reactions in different individuals."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":" 99 Figure 9-5. Universal Edibility Test 9-13. Before testing a plant for edibility, make sure there are enough plants to ma ke the testing worth your time and effort. Each part of a plan t (roots, leaves, flowers, and so on) requires more than 24 hours to test. Do not waste time testing a plant that is not relatively abundant in the area. 9-14. Remember, eating large portions of plant food on an empty stomach may cause diarrhea, nausea, or cramps. Two good examples of this are such familiar foods as green apples and wild onions. Even after testing plant food and finding it safe, eat it in moderation. 9-15. You can see from the steps and tim e involved in testing for edibility just how important it is to be able to identify edible plants. 9-16. To avoid potentially poisonous pl ants, stay away from any wild or unknown plants that have— • Milky or discolored sap. • Beans, bulbs, or seeds inside pods. • A bitter or soapy taste. • Spines, fine hairs, or thorns. • Foliage that resembles dill, carrot, parsnip, or parsley. • An almond scent in woody parts and leaves. • Grain heads with pink, purplish, or black spurs. • A three-leafed growth pattern. 9-17. Using the above criteria as eliminators when c hoosing plants for the Univ ersal Edibility Test will cause you to avoid some edible plants. More important, these criteria will often help you avoid plants that are potentially toxic to eat or touch. 9-18. An entire encyclopedia of edible wild plants could be written, but space limits the number of plants presented here. Learn as much as possible about the plant life of the areas where you train regularly and where you expect to be traveling or working.

Food Plants (Continued) SEAWEEDS 9-19. One plant you should never overl ook is seaweed. It is a form of ma rine algae found on or near ocean shores. There are also some edible freshwater variet ies. Seaweed is a valuable source of iodine, other minerals, and vitamin C. Large quantities of seaweed in an unaccustomed stomach can produce a severe laxative effect. Figure 9-7 lists various types of edible seaweed. • Dulse ( Rhodymenia palmata ) • Green seaweed ( Ulva lactuca ) • Irish moss ( Chondrus crispus ) • Kelp ( Alaria esculenta ) • Laver ( Porphyra species) • Mojaban ( Sargassum fulvellum ) • Sugar wrack ( Laminaria saccharina )"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":" 101 Figure 9-7. Types of Edible Seaweed 9-20. When gathering seaweed for food, find living plants attached to rocks or floating free. Seaweed washed onshore any length of time may be spoiled or decayed. You can dry freshly harvested seaweed for later use. 9-21. Different types of seaweed should be prepared in different ways. You can dry thin and tender varieties in the sun or over a fire until crisp. Crush and a dd these to soups or broths. Boil thick, leathery seaweeds for a short time to soften them. Eat them as a vegetable or with othe r foods. You can eat some varieties raw after testing for edibility. PREPARATION OF PLANT FOOD 9-22. Although some plants or plant pa rts are edible raw, you must cook ot hers for them to be edible or palatable. Edible means that a plant or food will provide you with necessary nutrients; palatable means that it is pleasing to eat. Many wild plants are edible but barely palata ble. It is a good idea to learn to identify, prepare, and eat wild foods. 9-23. Methods used to improve the taste of plan t food include soaking, boiling, cooking, or leaching. Leaching is done by crushing the food (for example, acorns), placing it in a strainer, and pouring boiling water through it or immersi ng it in running water. 9-24. Boil leaves, stems, and buds until tender, changing th e water, if necessary, to remove any bitterness. 9-25. Boil, bake, or roast tubers a nd roots. Drying helps to remove caustic oxala tes from some roots like those in the Arum family. 9-26. Leach acorns in water, if necessary, to remove th e bitterness. Some nuts, such as chestnuts, are good raw, but taste better roasted. 9-27. You can eat many grains and s eeds raw until they mature. When th ey are hard or dry, you may have to boil or grind them into meal or flour. 9-28. The sap from many trees, such as maples, birc hes, walnuts, and sycamores, contains sugar. You may boil these saps down to a syrup for sweetening. It ta kes about 35 liters of mapl e sap to make 1 liter of maple syrup! PLANTS FOR MEDICINE 9-29. In using plants for medical trea tment, positive identification of the plants involved is as critical as when using them for food. Proper use of these plants is equally important. TERMS AND DEFINITIONS 9-30. The following terms and their definitions are associated with medicinal plant use: • Poultice. This is crushed leaves or other plant part s, possibly heated, that are applied to a wound or sore either directly or wrappe d in cloth or paper. Poultices, wh en hot, increase the circulation in the affected area and help healing through the chemicals present in the plants. As the poultice dries"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":" 102 out, it draws the toxins out of a wound. A poultice s hould be prepared to a \"mashed potatoes-like\" consistency and applied as warm as the patient can stand. • Infusion or tisane or tea. This blend is the preparation of medi cinal herbs for internal or external application. You place a small quantity of a herb in a container, pour hot water over it, and let it steep (covered or uncovered) before use. Care must always be taken to not drink too much of a tea in the beginning of treatment as it may have adverse reactions on an empty stomach. • Decoction. This is the extract of a boiled-down or simmered herb leaf or root. You add herb leaf or root to water. You bring them to a sustained boil or simmer them to draw their chemicals into the water. The average ratio is about 28 to 56 grams (1 to 2 ounces) of herb to 0.5 liter of water. • Expressed juice. These are liquids or saps squeezed from plant material and either applied to the wound or made into another medicine. 9-31. Many natural remedies work sl ower than the medicines you know. Therefore, start with smaller doses and allow more time for them to take effect. Naturally, some will act more rapidly than others. Many of these treatments are addressed in more detail in Chapter 4 . SPECIFIC REMEDIES 9-32. The following remedies are for use only in a surviv al situation. Do not use them routinely as some can be potentially toxic and have serious l ong- term effects (for example, cancer). • Antidiarrheals for diarrhea. This can be one of the most debilitating illnesses for a survivor or prisoner of war. Drink tea made from the roots of blackberries and their relatives to stop diarrhea. White oak bark and other barks containing tannin ar e also effective when made into a strong tea. However, because of possible negative effect s on the kidneys, use them with caution and only when nothing else is available. Clay, ashes, charcoal, powdered chalk, powdered bones, and pectin can be consumed or mixed in a tannic acid tea with good results. These powdered mixtures should be taken in a dose of two tablespoons every 2 hours. Clay and pectin can be mixed together to give a crude form of Kaopectate. Pectin is obtainable fro m the inner part of citr us fruit rinds or from apple pomace. Tea made from cowberry, cranberry, or hazel leaves works, too. Because of its inherent danger to an already under-nourished survivor, several of these methods may need to be tried simultaneously to stop debi litating diarrhea, which can quic kly dehydrate even a healthy individual. • Antihemorrhagics for bleeding. Make medications to stop bleeding from plantain leaves, or, most effectively, from the leaves of the common yarrow or woundwort (Achillea millefolium). These mostly give a physical barrier to the bleeding. Prickly pear (the ra w, peeled part) or witch hazel can be applied to wounds. Both are good for their astringent properties (t hey shrink blood vessels). For bleeding gums or mouth sores, sweet gum can be chewed or used as a toothpick. This provides some chemical and antiseptic properties as well. • Antiseptics to clean infections. Use antiseptics to cleanse wounds, snake bites, sores, or rashes. You can make antiseptics from th e expressed juice of wild onion or garlic, the expressed juice from chickweed leaves, or the crushed leaves of dock. You can also make antiseptics from a decoction of burdock root, mallow leaves or roots, or white oak bark (tanni c acid). Prickly pear, slippery elm, yarrow, and sweet gum are all good antisepti cs as well. All these medications are for external use only. Two of the best antiseptics are sugar and honey. Sugar should be applied to the wound until it becomes syrupy, then washed off a nd reapplied. Honey should be applied three times daily (see Chapter 4 ). Honey is by far the best of the antiseptics for open wounds and burns, with sugar being second."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":" 103 • Antipyretics for fevers. Treat a fever with a tea made from willow bark, an infusion of elder flowers or fruit, linden flower tea, and aspen or slippery elm bark decoction. Yarrow tea is also good. Peppermint tea is reportedly good for fevers. • Colds and sore throats. Treat these illnesses with a decoction made from either plantain leaves or willow bark. You can also use a tea made from bur dock roots, mallow or mullein flowers or roots, and yarrow or mint leaves. • Analgesics for aches, pains, and sprains. Treat these conditions with externally applied poultices of dock, plantain, chickweed, willow bark, garlic, or sorrel. Sweet gum has some analgesic (pain relief) properties. Chewing the willow bark or maki ng a tea from it is the best for pain relief as it contains the raw component of aspirin. You can also use salves made by mixing the expressed juices of these plants in animal fat or vegetable oils. • Antihistamines and astringents for itching or contact dermatitis. Relieve the itch from insect bites, sunburn, or plant poisoning rashes by applying a poultice of jewelweed (Impatiens biflora) or witch hazel, which give a cooli ng relief and dry out the weeping (Hamamelis virginiana) leaves. The jewelweed juice will help when applied to po ison ivy, rashes, or insect stings. Jewelweed and aloe vera help relieve sunburn. In addition, dande lion sap, crushed cloves of garlic, and sweet gum have been used. Crushed leaves of burdock have received only so-so reports of success, but crushed, green plantain leaves show relief over a few days. Jewelweed is probably the best of these plants. Tobacco will deaden the nerve ending s and can also be used to treat toothaches. • Sedatives. Get help in falling asleep by brewing a tea made from mint leav es or passionflower leaves. • Hemorrhoids. Treat them with external washes from elm bark or oak bark tea, from the expressed juice of plantain leaves, or from a Solomon's s eal root decoction. Tannic acid or witch hazel will provide soothing relief because of their astringent properties. • Heat rash. Tannic acid or witch hazel will provide soothing relief because of their astringent properties but cornstarch or any crushed and po wdered, nonpoisonous plant should help to dry out the rash after a thorough cleansing. • Constipation. Relieve constipation by drinking decoctions from dandelion leaves, rose hips, or walnut bark. Eating raw daylily fl owers will also help. Large am ounts of water in any form are critical to relieving constipation. • Antihelminthics for worms or intestinal parasites. Most treatment for worms or parasites are toxic—just more so for the worms or parasites th an for humans. Therefore, all treatments should be used in moderation. Treatments include tea made from tansy (Tanacetum vulgare) or from wild carrot (poisonous) leaves. Very strong tannic acid can also be used w ith caution as it is very hard on the liver. See Chapter 4 for more deworming techniques. • Antiflatulents for gas and cramps. Use a tea made from carrot seeds; use tea made from mint leaves to settle the stomach. • Antifungal washes. Make a decoction of walnut leaves, oa k bark, or acorns to treat ringworm and athlete's foot. Apply it frequently to the site, alte rnating with exposure to direct sunlight. Broad- leaf plantain has also been used with success but any treatment should be used in addition to sunlight if possible. Jewelweed and vinegar make excellent washes but are sometimes difficult to find. • Burns. Tannic acid, sugar, and honey can be used as explained in Chapter 4 . • Dentifrices for teeth. See Chapter 4 for other techniques in additi on to using twigs of sweet gum for its anti-inflammatory, analgesi c, and antiseptic properties. • Insect repellents. Garlic and onions can be eaten and the raw plant juice rubbed on the skin to repel some insects. Sassafras leaves can be rubbe d on the skin. Cedar chips may help repel insects around your shelter. • Tannic acid. Because tannic acid is used for so many treatments (burns, antihemorrhagics, antihelminthics, antiseptics, antidiarrheals, antif ungals, bronchitis, skin inflammation, lice), a note"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":" 104 as to its preparation is in orde r. All thready plants, especially trees, contain tannic acid. Hardwood trees generally contain more than softwood tr ees. Of the hardwoods, oak—especially red and chestnut—contain the highest amount. The warty l ooking knots in oak trees can contain as much as 28 percent tannic acid. This knot, the inner bark of trees, and pine needles (cut into 2-centimeter [1-inch] strips), can all be boiled down to extract tannic acid. Boiling can be done in as little as 15 minutes (very weak), to 2 hours (moderate), through 12 hours to 3 da ys (very strong). The stronger concoctions will have a dark color that will vary depending on the type of tree. All will have an increasingly vile taste in re lation to their concentration. MISCELLANEOUS USES OF PLANTS 9-33. Plants can be your ally as l ong as you use them cautiously. Be su re that you know the plant and how to use it. Some additional uses of plants are as follows: • Make dyes from various plants to color clothi ng or to camouflage your skin. Usually, you will have to boil the plants to get the best results. Onionskins pr oduce yellow, walnut hulls produce brown, and pokeberries provide purple dye. • Make fibers and cordage from plant fibers. Most commonly used are the stems from nettles and milkweeds, yucca plants, and the inner bark of trees like the linden. • Make tinder for starting fires from cattail fluff, cedar bark, lighter knot wood from pine trees, or hardened sap from resinous wood trees. • Make insulation by fluffing up female cattail heads or milkweed down. • Make insect repellents by pl acing sassafras leaves in your shelter or by burning or smudging cattail seed hair fibers. 9-34. Whether you use plants for food, medicine, or th e construction of shelters or equipment, the key to their safe use is positive identification . Chapter 10 Poisonous Plants Successful use of plants in a su rvival situation depends on positive identification. Knowing poisonous plants is as important to you as knowing edible plants. Knowing the poisonous plants will help you avoid sustaining injuries from them. HOW PLANTS POISON 10-1. Plants generally poison by— • Contact. This contact with a poisonous plant causes any type of skin irritation or dermatitis. • Ingestion. This occurs when a person eats a part of a poisonous plant. • Absorption or inhalation. This happens when a person either absorbs the poison through the skin or inhales it into th e respiratory system. 10-2. Plant poisoning ranges from minor irritatio n to death. A common que stion asked is, \"How poisonous is this plant?\" It is difficult to say how poisonous plants are because—"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":" 105 • Some plants require a large amount of contact before you notice any adverse reaction although others will cause death with only a small amount. • Every plant will vary in the amount of toxins it contains due to different growing conditions and slight variations in subspecies. • Every person has a different level of resistance to toxic substances. • Some persons may be more sens itive to a particular plant. 10-3. Some common misconceptions about poisonous plants are— • Watch the animals and eat what they eat. Most of the time this statement is true, but some animals can eat plants that are poisonous to humans. • Boil the plant in water and any poisons will be removed. Boiling removes many poisons, but not all. • Plants with a red color are poisonous. Some plants that are red are poisonous, but not all. 10-4. The point is there is no one rule to aid in identifying poisonous plan ts. You must make an effort to learn as much about them as possible. ALL ABOUT PLANTS 10-5. Many poisonous plants look like th eir edible relatives or like othe r edible plants. For example, poison hemlock appears very similar to wild carrot. Certain plants are sa fe to eat in certain seasons or stages of growth but poisonous in ot her stages. For example, the leaves of the pokeweed are edible when it first starts to grow, but they s oon become poisonous. You can eat some plants and their fruits only when they are ripe. For example, the ripe fruit of May apple is edible, but all other parts and the green fruit are poisonous. Some plants contain both edible and pois onous parts; potatoes and tomatoes are common plant foods, but their green parts are poisonous. 10-6. Some plants become toxic af ter wilting. For example, when the black cherry starts to wilt, hydrocyanic acid develops. Specific prep aration methods make some plants edible that are poisonous raw. You can eat the thinly sliced and thoroughly dried (d rying may take a year) co rms of the jack-in-the- pulpit, but they are pois onous if not thoroughly dried. 10-7. Learn to identify and use plants before a survival situati on. Some sources of information about plants are pamphlets, books, films, nature trails, botanical gardens, local markets, and local natives. Gather and cross-reference information from as many sources as possible, because many sources will not contain all the information needed. RULES FOR AVOIDING POISONOUS PLANTS 10-8. Your best policy is to be able to positively id entify plants by sight and to know their uses or dangers. Many times absolute certainty is not possib le. If you have little or no knowledge of the local vegetation, use the rules to select plants for the Universal Edibility Test. Remember, avoid — • All mushrooms. Mushroom identification is very di fficult and must be precis e—even more so than with other plants. Some mushrooms cause deat h very quickly. Some mushrooms have no known antidote. Two general types of mushroom poisoning are gastroin testinal and central nervous system. • Contact with or touching plants unnecessarily."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":" 106 CONTACT DERMATITIS 10-9. Contact dermatitis from plants will usually cause the most trouble in the field. The effects may be persistent, spread by scratching, and particularly dangerous if there is contact in or around the eyes. 10-10. The principal toxin of these plants is usually an oil that gets on the skin upon contact with the plant. The oil can also get on equipment and then in fect whoever touches the equipment. Never burn a contact poisonous plant because the sm oke may be as harmful as the plan t. You have a greater danger of being affected when you are overheated and sweating. The infection may be loca l or it may spread over the body. 10-11. Symptoms may take from a few hours to severa l days to appear. Symptoms can include burning, reddening, itching, swelling, and blisters. 10-12. When you first contact the poisonous plants or wh en the first symptoms appear, try to remove the oil by washing with soap and cold wate r. If water is not availa ble, wipe your skin re peatedly with dirt or sand. Do not use dirt if you have blisters. The dirt may break open the blisters and leave the body open to infection. After you have removed the oil, dry the ar ea. You can wash with a tannic acid solution and crush and rub jewelweed on the affected area to treat plant-caused rashes. You can make tannic acid from oak bark. 10-13. Poisonous plants that cause contact dermatitis are— • Cowhage. • Poison ivy. • Poison oak. • Poison sumac. • Rengas tree. • Trumpet vine. INGESTION POISONING 10-14. Ingestion poisoning can be very serious and could lead to death ve ry quickly. Do not eat any plant unless you have positively identified it fi rst. Keep a log of all plants eaten. 10-15. Symptoms of ingestion poisoning can include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, depressed heartbeat and respirati on, headaches, hallucinations, dry m outh, unconsciousness, coma, and death. 10-16. If you suspect plant poisoning, try to remove th e poisonous material from the victim's mouth and stomach as soon as possible. If the victim is conscious, induce vomiting by tickling the back of his throat or by giving him warm saltwater. If the victim is conscious, dilute the poison by administering large quantities of water or milk. 10-17. The following plants can cause ingestion poisoning if eaten: • Castor bean. • Chinaberry. • Death camas."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":" 107 • Lantana. • Manchineel. • Oleander. • Pangi. • Physic nut. • Poison and water hemlocks. • Rosary pea. • Strychnine tree. 10-18. Appendix C provides photographs and desc riptions of these plants. Chapter 11 Dangerous Animals The threat from animals is less than from other parts of the environment. However, common sense tells you to avoid encounters with lions, b ears, and other large or dangerous animals. You should also avoid large grazing animals with horns, hooves, and great weight. Move car efully through their environment. Caution may prevent unexpected meetings. Do not attract large predators by leaving food lying around your camp. Carefully survey the scene before entering water or forests. Smaller animals actually present more of a threat to you than large animals. To compensate for their size, nature has given many small animals weapons such as fangs and stingers to defend themselves. Each year, a few people are bitten by sharks, mauled by alligators, and attacked by bears. Most of these incidents were in some way the victim's fault. However, each year more victims die from bites by relatively small venomous snakes than by large dangerous animals. Even more victims die from allergic reactions to bee stings. These smaller animals are the ones you are more likely to meet as you unwittingly move into their habitat, or they slip into your environment unnoticed. Keeping a level head and an awareness of your surr oundings will keep you alive if you use a few simple safety procedures. Do not let curiosit y and carelessness ki ll or injure you. INSECTS AND ARACHNIDS 11-1. Insects, except centipedes and millipedes, have six legs; arachnids have eight. All these small creatures become pests when they bite, sting, or irritate you. 11-2. Although their venom can be quite painful, bee, wasp, and hornet st ings rarely kill a person who is not allergic to that particular toxin. Even the most dangerous spiders rarely kill, and the effects of tick- borne diseases are very slow-acting. However, in all cases, avoidance is the best defense. In environments known to have spiders and scorpions, check your foot gear and clothing every morning. Also check your bedding and shelter. Use care when turning over rocks and logs. See Appendix D for examples of dangerous insects and arachnids. SCORPIONS 11-3. You find scorpions ( Buthotus species) in deserts, jungles, and fo rests of tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate areas of the world. They are mostly nocturnal. Desert scorpions range from below sea level in Death Valley to elevations as high as 3,600 meters (12,000 feet) in the Andes. Typically brown or"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":" 108 black in moist areas, they may be yellow or light gr een in the desert. Their average size is about 2.5 centimeters (1 inch). However, there are 20-centimeter (8 -inch) giants in the jungl es of Central America, New Guinea, and southern Africa. Fatalities from sc orpion stings are rare, but do occur with children, the elderly, and ill persons. Scorpions resemble small lobsters with raised, jointed tails bearing a stinger in the tip. Nature mimics the scorpions with whip scorpions or vinegarroons. These are harmless and have a tail like a wire or whip, rather than the join ted tail and stinger of true scorpions. SPIDERS 11-4. The brown recluse, or fiddleb ack spider, of North America ( Loxosceles reclusa ) is recognized by a prominent violin-shaped light spot on the back of its body. As its name suggests, this spider likes to hide in dark places. Though its bite is rarely fatal, it can cause excessive tissu e degeneration around the wound, leading to amputation of the digits if left untreated. 11-5. Members of the widow family ( Latrodectus species) may be found worldwide, though the black widow of North America is perhaps the most we ll-known. Found in warmer areas of the world, the widows are small, dark spiders with often hourgl ass-shaped white, red, or orange spots on their abdomens. 11-6. Funnelwebs ( Atrax species) are large, gray or brown Au stralian spiders. C hunky, with short legs, they are able to move easily up and down the cone-shaped webs from which they get their name. The local populace considers them deadly. Avoid them as they move about, usually at night, in search of prey. Symptoms of their bite are similar to those of the widow's—severe pain a ccompanied by sweating and shivering, weakness, and disabling episodes that can last a week. 11-7. Tarantulas are la rge, hairy spiders ( Theraphosidae and Lycosa species) best known because they are often sold in pet stores. There is one species in Europe, but most come from tropical America. Some South American species do inject a dangerous toxi n, but most simply produce a painful bite. Some tarantulas can be as large as a dinner plate. They all have large fangs for capturing food such as birds, mice, and lizards. If bitten by a tarantula, pain and bleeding are certain, a nd infection is likely. CENTIPEDES AND MILLIPEDES 11-8. Centipedes and millipedes are mostly small and harmless, although some tropical and desert species may reach 25 centimeters (10 inches). A few varieties of centipedes have a poisonous bite, but infection is the greatest danger, as their shar p claws dig in and puncture the skin. To prevent skin punctures, brush them off in the direc tion they are traveling. BEES, WASPS, AND HORNETS 11-9. Bees, wasps, and hornets come in many varieties and have a wide diversity of habits and habitats. You recognize bees by their hairy and usually thick body, while the wa sps, hornets, and yellow jackets have more slender, nearly hairless bodies. Some b ees, such as honeybees, live in colonies. They may be either domesticated or living wild in caves or hollow trees. You may find other bees, such as carpenter bees, in individual nest holes in w ood or in the ground like bumblebees. The main danger from bees is the barbed stinger located on their abdomens. When a b ee stings you, it rips its st inger out of its abdomen along with the venom sac, and dies. Ex cept for killer bees, most bees tend to be more docile than wasps, hornets, and yellow jackets, which have smooth s tingers and are cap able of repeated attacks."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":" 109 11-10. Avoidance is the best tactic for self-protection. Watch out for fl owers or fruit where bees may be feeding. Be careful of meat-eating yellow jackets when cleaning fish or game. The average person has a relatively minor and temporary reaction to bee stings a nd recovers in a couple of hours when the pain and headache go away. Those who are allergic to bee venom have severe reacti ons including anaphylactic shock, coma, and death. If antihistamine medicine is not available and you ca nnot find a substitute, an allergy sufferer in a survival situation is in grave danger. TICKS 11-11. Ticks are common in the tropics and temperate regions. They are familiar to most of us. Ticks are small, round arachnids. They can have either a soft or hard body. Ticks require a blood host to survive and reproduce. This makes them dangerous because they sp read diseases like Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, encephalitis, and others that can ultimately be disabling or fatal. There is little you can do to treat these diseases once th ey are contracted, but time is your a lly since it takes at least 6 hours of attachment to the host for the tick to transmit the disease organisms. Thus, you have time to thoroughly inspect your body for their presence. Beware of ticks when passing through the th ick vegetation they cling to, when cleaning host animals for food, and when gath ering natural materials to construct a shelter. Always use insect repellents, if possible. LEECHES 11-12. Leeches are bloodsucking creatures with a worm like appearance. You find them in the tropics and in temperate zones. You will certainly encounter th em when swimming in infested waters or making expedient water crossings. You can find them when passing through swampy, tropical vegetation and bogs. You can also find them while cleaning food animals, such as turtles, found in fresh water. Leeches can crawl into small openings; ther efore, avoid camping in their ha bitats when possible. Keep your trousers tucked in your boots. Check yourself frequently for leeches. Swallowed or eaten, leeches can be a great hazard. It is therefore essential to treat water from questionable sources by boiling or using chemical water treatments. Survivors have developed severe inf ections from wounds inside the throat or nose when sores from swallowed leeches became infected. BATS 11-13. Despite the legends, bats ( Desmodus species) are a relatively sma ll hazard to you. There are many bat varieties worldwide, but you find the true vampire bats only in Central and South America. They are small, agile fliers that land on thei r sleeping victims, mostly cows a nd horses, to lap a blood meal after biting their victim. Their saliva co ntains an anticoagulant that keeps the blood slowly flowing while they feed. All bats are considered to carry rabies. Any physical contact is considered to be a rabies risk. They can carry other diseases and infections and will bite readily when handled. However, taking shelter in a cave occupied by bats presents the much greater hazard of inhaling powdere d bat dung, or guano. Bat dung carries many organisms that can cause diseases. Eating thoroughly cooked flying foxes or other bats presents no danger from rabies and other diseases, but again, the emphasis is on thorough cooking. VENOMOUS SNAKES 11-14. There are no infallible rules for expedient identi fication of venomous snakes in the field, because the guidelines all requ ire close observation or mani pulation of the snake's body. Th e best strategy is to leave all snakes alone. Where snakes are plentiful and venomous species are present, the risk of their bites"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":" 110 negates their food value. Apply the following safety rules when traveling in areas where there are venomous snakes: • Walk carefully and watch where you step. Step onto logs rather than over them in a survival situation. During evasion, always step over or go around logs to leave fewer signs for trackers. • Look closely when picking fr uit or moving around water. • Do not tease, molest, or harass snakes. Snakes ca nnot close their eyes. Ther efore, you cannot tell if they are asleep. Some snakes, such as mambas, cobras, and bushmasters, will attack aggressively when cornered or guarding a nest. • Use sticks to turn logs and rocks. • Wear proper footgear, pa rticularly at night. • Carefully check bedding, shelter, and clothing. • Be calm when you encounter serpents. Snakes cannot hear and you can occasionally surprise them when they are sleeping or sunning. Normall y, they will flee if given the opportunity. • Use extreme care if you must kill snakes for f ood or safety. Although it is not common, warm, sleeping human bodies occasionally attract snakes. 11-15. Appendix E provides detailed descriptions of the snakes listed in Figure 11-1 . The Americas • American Copperhead ( Agkistrodon contortrix ) • Bushmaster ( Lachesis muta ) • Coral snake ( Micrurus fulvius ) • Cottonmouth ( Agkistrodon piscivorus ) • Fer-de-lance ( Bothrops atrox ) • Rattlesnake ( Crotalus species) Europe • Common adder (Vipers berus) • Pallas' viper (Agkistrodon halys) Africa and Asia • Boomslang ( Dispholidus typus ) • Cobra ( Naja species) Figure 11-1.

Venomous Snakes of the World (Continued) SNAKE-FREE AREAS 11-16. The polar regions are free of snakes due to thei r inhospitable environments. Other areas considered to be free of venomous snakes are New Zealand, Cuba , Haiti, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Ireland, Polynesia, and Hawaii. DANGEROUS LIZARDS 11-17. The Gila monster ( Heloderma suspectrum ) of the American Southwest and Mexico is a dangerous and poisonous lizard with dark, highly textured skin marked by pinkish mottling. It is typically 35 to 45 centimeters (14 to 18 inches) in length and has a thick, stumpy tail. The Gila monster is unlikely to bite unless molested but has a poisonous bite. 11-18. The Mexican beaded lizard ( Heloderma horridum ) resembles its relative, the Gila monster. However, it has more uniform spots rather than bands of color. It also is poisonous and has a docile nature. You may find it from Me xico to Central America. 11-19. The komodo dragon is a giant lizard ( Varanus komodoensis ) that grows to more than 3 meters (10 feet) in length. It can be dangerous if you try to capture it. This I ndonesian lizard can weigh more than 135 kilograms (300 pounds). DANGERS IN RIVERS 11-20. Common sense will tell you to avoid confrontations with hippopotami, alligators, crocodiles, and other large river creatures. Howeve r, there are also the following sma ller river creatures with which you should be cautious."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":" 112 11-21. Electric eels ( Electrophorus electricus ) may reach 2 meters (7 feet) in length and 20 centimeters (8 inches) in diameter. Avoid them. They are capable of generating up to 500 volts of electricity in certain organs of their body. They use this shock to stun prey and enemies. Normally, you find these eels in the Orinoco and Amazon River systems in South America. Th ey seem to prefer shallow waters that are more highly oxygenated and provide more food. They are bul kier than American eels. Their upper body is dark gray or black with a li ghter-colored underbelly. 11-22. Piranhas ( Serrasalmo species) are another hazard of the Orinoco and Amazon River systems, as well as the Paraguay River Basin, wher e they are native. These fish vary greatly in size and coloration, but usually have a combination of orange undersides and dark tops. They have white, razor-sharp teeth that are clearly visible. They may be as long as 50 centimeters (20 inch es). Use great care when crossing waters where they live. Blood attracts them. They are most dangerous in shallow waters during the dry season. 11-23. Be careful when handling and capturing large fres hwater turtles, such as the snapping turtles and soft-shelled turtles of North America and the matamata and other turtles of South America. All of these turtles will bite in self-defense and can amputate fingers and toes. 11-24. The platypus or duckbill ( Ornithorhyncus anatinus ) is the only member of its family and is easily recognized. It has a long body covered with grayish, short hair , a tail like a beaver, and a bill like a duck. Growing up to 60 centimeters (24 inches) in length, it may appear to be a good food source, but this egg- laying mammal, the only one in the world, is very da ngerous. The male has a poisonous spur on each hind foot that can inflict intensely pa inful wounds. You find the platypus onl y in Australia, mainly along mud banks on waterways. DANGERS IN BAYS AND ESTUARIES 11-25. In areas where seas and rivers come together, there are dangers associat ed with both freshwater and saltwater. In shallow saltwaters, there are many cr eatures that can inflict pain and cause infection to develop. Stepping on sea urchins, for example, can produce pain and infection. When moving about in shallow water, wear some form of footgear and shuffle your feet along the bottom, rather than picking up your feet and stepping. 11-26. Stingrays ( Dasyatidae species) are a real hazard in shallow waters, especially tropical waters. The type of bottom appears to be irrelevant. There is a great variance between species, but all have a sharp spike in their tail that may be ve nomous and can cause extremely pain ful wounds if stepped on. All rays have a typical shape that resembles a kite. You find them along the coasts of the Americas, Africa, and Australia. SALTWATER DANGERS 11-27. There are several fish that you should not handle, touch, or contact. There are also others that you should not eat. These fish are described below. 11-28. Sharks are the most feared animal in the s ea. Usually, shark attacks cannot be avoided and are considered accidents. You should take every precauti on to avoid any contact w ith sharks. There are many shark species, but in general, dangerous sharks have wide mouths and visi ble teeth, while relatively harmless ones have small mouths on the underside of th eir heads. However, any shark can inflict painful and often fatal injuries, eith er through bites or through ab rasions from their rough skin."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":" 113 11-29. Rabbitfish or spinefoot ( Siganidae species) live mainly on coral reefs in the Indian and Pacific oceans. They have very sharp, possibly venomous spines in their fins. Handle them with care, if at all. This fish, like many others of the dangerous fish in this section, is considered edible by native peoples where the fish are found, but deaths occur from care less handling. Seek other nonpoisonous fish to eat if possible. 11-30. Tang or surgeonfish ( Acanthuridae species) average 20 to 25 centim eters (8 to 10 inches) in length and often are beautifully colored. They are called surge onfish because of the scalpe l-like spines located in the tail. The wounds inflicted by th ese spines can bring about death through infection, envenomation, and loss of blood, which may inci dentally attract sharks. 11-31. Toadfish ( Batrachoididae species) live in tropical waters off the Gulf Coast of the United States and along both coasts of Central and South America. These dully-colored fish average 18 to 25 centimeters (7 to 10 inches) in length. They typically bury themselves in the sand to await fish and other prey. They have sharp, very toxic spines along their backs. 11-32. Poisonous scorpion fish or zebra fish ( Scorpaenidae species) are mostly around reefs in the tropical Indian and Pacific oceans and occasionally in the Mediterranean and Ae gean seas. They average 30 to 75 centimeters (12 to 29 inches) in length. Their coloration is highly variable, from reddish brown to almost purple or brownish yellow. They have long, wavy fins and spines and their sting is intensely painful. Less poisonous relatives live in the Atlantic Ocean. 11-33. Stonefish ( Synanceja species) are in the Pacific and Indi an oceans. They can inject a painful venom from their dorsal spines when stepped on or handled carelessly. They are almost impossible to see because of their lumpy shape and drab colors. Th ey range in size up to 40 centimeters (16 inches). 11-34. Weever fish ( Trachinidae species) average 30 centimeters (12 in ches) long. They are hard to see as they lie buried in the sand off the coasts of Europe, Africa, and the Mediterranea n. Their color is usually a dull brown. They have venomous spines on the back and gills. NOTE: Appendix F provides more details on these venomous fish and toxic mollusks. 11-35. The livers of polar bears are c onsidered toxic due to high concentrations of vitamin A. There is a chance of death after eating this or gan. Another toxic meat is the flesh of the hawksbill turtle. These animals are distinguished by a down-tu rned bill and yellow pol ka dots on their neck and front flippers. They weigh more than 275 kilograms ( 605 pounds) and are unlikely to be captured. 11-36. Many fish living in lagoons, es tuaries, or reefs near shore ar e poisonous to eat, though some are only seasonally dangerous. Although the majority are tropical fish; be wary of eating any unidentifiable fish wherever you are. Some predatory fish, such as barracuda and snapper, may become toxic if the fish they feed on in shallow waters are poisonous. The mo st poisonous types appear to have parrotlike beaks and hard shell-like skins with spines and can often inflate their bodies like balloons. However, at certain times of the year, indigenous populati ons consider the puffer a delicacy. 11-37. The blowfish or puffer ( Tetraodontidae species) are more tolerant of cold water. They live along tropical and temperate coasts worldwide, even in some of the rivers of Southeast Asia and Africa. Stout- bodied and round, many of these fish have short spin es and can inflate themselves into a ball when alarmed or agitated. Their blood, liver, and gonads are so toxic that as little as 28 milligrams (1 ounce) can be fatal. These fish vary in color and size, growing up to 75 centimeters (29 inches) in length."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":" 114 11-38. The triggerfish ( Balistidae species) occur in great variety, mos tly in tropical seas. They are deep- bodied and compressed, resembling a seagoing pancake up to 60 centimeters (24 inches) in length, with large and sharp dorsal spines. Avoid them all, as many have poisonous flesh. 11-39. Although most people avoid them because of their ferocity, they occasionally eat barracuda ( Sphyraena barracuda ). These predators of mostly tropical seas can reach almost 1.5 meters (5 feet) in length and have attacked humans without provocati on. They occasionally carry the poison ciguatera in their flesh, making them deadly if consumed. OTHER DANGEROUS SEA CREATURES 11-40. The blue-ringed octopus, jellyfish, and the cone and auger shells are other dangerous sea creatures. Therefore, you should always be alert a nd move carefully in any body of water. 11-41. Most octopi are excellent when properly prepared. However, the blue-ringed octopus ( Hapalochlaena lunulata ) can inflict a deadly bite from its parrot like beak. Fortunately, it is restricted to the Great Barrier Reef of Australia and is very sma ll. It is easily recognized by its grayish white overall color and irridescent blue rings. Authorities warn that all tropical octopus speci es should be treated with caution because of their poisonous bites, although their flesh is edible. 11-42. Deaths related to jell yfish are rare, but the sting they inflic t is extremely painful. The Portuguese man-of-war resembles a large pink or purple balloon floating on the s ea. It has poisonous tentacles hanging up to 12 meters (40 feet) below its body. The huge tentacles are actually colonies of stinging cells. Most known deaths from jellyfish are attributed to th e man-of-war. Other jellyfish can inflict very painful stings as well. Avoid the long tentacles of any jellyfish, even those washed up on the beach and apparently dead. 11-43. The subtropical and tropical cone shells ( Conidae species) have a venomous harpoonlike barb. All have a fine netlike pattern on the shell. A membrane may possibly obscure this coloration. There are some very poisonous cone shells, even some lethal ones in the Indian and Pacific oceans. Avoid any shell shaped like an ice cream cone. 11-44. The auger shell or terebra ( Terebridae species) are much longer and thinner than the cone shells, but can be nearly as deadly. They are found in temper ate and tropical seas. Those in the Indian and Pacific oceans have a more toxic venom in their stinging bar b. Do not eat these snails, as their flesh may be poisonous. Chapter 12 Field-Expedient Weapons, Tools, and Equipment As a soldier, you know the importan ce of proper care and use of your weapons, tools, and equipment. This is especially true of your knife . You must always keep it sharp and ready to use. A knife is your most valuable tool in a survival situat ion. Imagine being in a survival situ ation without any weapons, tools, or equipment except your knife. It could happen! You might even be without a knife. You would probably feel helpless, but with the proper knowledge and skills, you can easily improvise needed items. In survival situations, you may have to fashion any number a nd type of field-expedient tools and equipment to survive. The need for an item must outweigh the work involved in making it. You should"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":" 115 ask, \"Is it necessary or just nice to have?\" Remember that undue haste makes waste. Examples of tools and equipment that could make your life much easier are ropes ( Appendix G ), rucksacks, clothes, and nets. Weapons serve a dual purpose. You use them to obtai n and prepare food and to provide self-defense. A weapon can also give you a feeling of security and provide you with the ability to hunt on the move. STAFFS 12-1. A staff should be one of the first tools you obtain. For walking, it provide s support and helps in ascending and descending steep slopes . It provides some weapon's capabili ties if used properly, especially against snakes and dogs. It should be approximately th e same height as you or at least eyebrow height. The staff should be no larger than you can effectiv ely wield when tired and undernourished. It provides invaluable eye protection when you are moving through heavy brush and thorns in darkness. CLUBS 12-2. You hold clubs; you do not throw them. However, the club can extend your area of defense beyond your fingertips. It also serves to increase the force of a blow without injuri ng yourself. The three basic types of clubs are explained below. SIMPLE CLUB 12-3. A simple club is a staff or branch. It must be short enough for you to swing easily, but long enough and strong enough for you to damage whatever you hit. Its diameter should fit comfortably in your palm, but it should not be so thin as to allow the club to break easily upon impact. A straight-grained hardwood is best if you can find it. WEIGHTED CLUB 12-4. A weighted club is any simple club with a weight on one end. The weight may be a natural weight, such as a knot on the wood, or something a dded, such as a stone lashed to the club. 12-5. To make a weighted club, first fi nd a stone that has a shape that will allow you to lash it securely to the club. A stone with a slight hourglass shape works well. If you cannot find a suitably shaped stone, then fashion a groove or channel into the stone by \"pecking,\" repeatedly rapping the club stone with a smaller hard stone. 12-6. Next, find a piece of wood that is the right length for you. A straig ht-grained hardwood is best. The length of the wood should feel comfortable in relation to the weight of th e stone. Finally, lash the stone to the handle using a technique shown in Figure 12-1 . The technique you use will depend on the type of handle you choose."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":" 116 Figure 12-1. Lashing Clubs SLING CLUB 12-7. A sling club is another type of weighted club. A weight hangs 8 to 10 centimeters (3 to 4 inches) from the handle by a strong, flexible lashing ( Figure 12-2 ). This type of club both extends the user's reach and multiplies the force of the blow. Figure 12-2. Sling Club"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":" 117 EDGED WEAPONS 12-8. Knives, spear blades, and arrow points fall under the category of edged weapons. The following paragraphs explain how to make such weapons. KNIVES 12-9. A knife has three basic functions. It can punc ture, slash or chop, and cut. A knife is also an invaluable tool used to construct other survival it ems. You may find yourself w ithout a knife or you may need another type knife or a spear. To improvise you can use stone, bone, wood, or metal to make a knife or spear blade. Stone 12-10. To make a stone knife, you will need a sharp-ed ged piece of stone, a chipping tool, and a flaking tool. A chipping tool is a light, blunt-e dged tool used to break off small pieces of stone. A flaking tool is a pointed tool used to break off thin, flattened pieces of stone. Y ou can make a chipping tool from wood, bone, or metal, and a flaking tool from bone, antler tines, or soft iron ( Figure 12-3 ). Figure 12-3. Making a Stone Knife 12-11. Start making the knife by roughi ng out the desired shape on your sharp piece of stone, using the chipping tool. Try to make the knife fairly thin. Then, press the flaking tool against the edges. This action will cause flakes to come off the opposite side of th e edge, leaving a razor-sharp edge. Use the flaking"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":" 118 tool along the entire length of the edge you need to sharpen. Eventually, you will have a very, sharp cutting edge that you can use as a knife. 12-12. Lash the blade to some type of hilt ( Figure 12-3 ). NOTE: Stone will make an excellent puncturing tool and a good chopping tool but will not hold a fine edge. Some stones such as chert or flint can have very fine edges. Bone 12-13. You can also use bone as an effective field-expedient edged weapon. First, you will need to select a suitable bone. The larger bones, su ch as the leg bone of a deer or a nother medium-sized animal, are best. Lay the bone upon another hard object. Shatter the bone by hitting it with a heavy object, such as a rock. From the pieces, select a suitable pointed splinter. You can further shape and sharpen this splinter by rubbing it on a rough-surfaced rock. If the piece is too small to handle, you can still use it by adding a handle to it. Select a suitable piece of hardwood for a handle and lash the bone splinter securely to it. NOTE: Use the bone knife only to puncture. It will not hol d an edge and it may flake or break if used differently. Wood 12-14. You can make field-expedient edged weapons from wood. Use these only to puncture. Bamboo is the only wood that will hold a suitable edge. To make a knife from wood , first select a straight-grained piece of hardwood that is about 30 centimeters (12 in ches) long and 2.5 centimeters (1 inch) in diameter. Fashion the blade about 15 centimeter s (6 inches) long. Shave it down to a point. Use only the straight- grained portions of the wood. Do not use the core or pith, as it would make a weak point. 12-15. Harden the point by a process know n as fire hardening. If a fire is possible, dry the blade portion over the fire slowly until lightly charred. The drier the wood, the hard er the point. After lightly charring the blade portion, sharpen it on a coarse stone. If using bamboo a nd after fashioning the blade, remove any other wood to make the blade thinner from the in side portion of the bam boo. Removal is done this way because bamboo's hardest part is its outer layer. K eep as much of this layer as possible to ensure the hardest blade possible. When charring bamboo over a fire, char only the inside wood; do not char the outside. Metal 12-16. Metal is the best material to make field-expedient edged wea pons. Metal, when properly designed, can fulfill a knife's three uses—puncture, slice or chop, and cut. First, select a suitable piece of metal, one that most resembles the desired end product. Depe nding on the size and original shape, you can obtain a point and cutting edge by rubbing the metal on a r ough-surfaced stone. If the metal is soft enough, you can hammer out one edge while the metal is cold. Use a suitable flat, hard surface as an anvil and a smaller, harder object of stone or metal as a hammer to hammer out the edge. Make a knife handle from wood, bone, or other material that will protect your hand. Other Materials"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":" 119 12-17. You can use other materials to produce edged weapons. Glass is a good alternative to an edged weapon or tool, if no other material is available. Obtain a suitable pi ece in the same manner as described for bone. Glass has a natural edge but is less durable fo r heavy work. You can also sharpen plastic—if it is thick enough or hard enough—into a durable point for puncturing. SPEAR BLADES 12-18. To make spears, use the same procedures to make the blade that you used to make a knife blade. Then select a shaft (a straight sa pling) 1.2 to 1.5 meters (4 to 5 f eet) long. The length should allow you to handle the spear easily and effectively. Attach the spear blade to the shaft using lashing. The preferred method is to split the handle, insert the blade, then wrap or lash it tightly. You can use other materials without adding a blade. Select a 1.2- to 1.5-meter (4- to 5-foot) long straight hardwood shaft and shave one end to a point. If possible, fire -harden the point. Bamboo also makes an excellent spear. Select a piece 1.2 to 1.5 meters (4 to 5 feet) long. St arting 8 to 10 centimeters (3 to 4 in ches) back from the end used as the point, shave down the end at a 45-degree angle ( Figure 12-4 ). Remember, to sharpen the edges, shave only the inner portion. Figure 12-4. Bamboo Spear ARROW POINTS 12-19. To make an arrow point, use the same procedures for making a stone knife blade. Chert, flint, and shell-type stones are best for a rrow points. You can fashion bone like stone—by flaking. You can make an efficient arrow point using broken glass. OTHER EXPEDIENT WEAPONS 12-20. You can make other field-expedient weapons such as the throwing stick, archery equipment, and the bola. The following paragraphs explain how to make these. THROWING STICK 12-21. The throwing stick, commonly known as the rabbit stick, is very effective against small game (squirrels, chipmunks, and rabbits). The rabbit stick itse lf is a blunt stick, natura lly curved at about a 45- degree angle. Select a stick with the desired angle from heavy ha rdwood such as oak. Shave off two opposite sides so that the stick is flat like a boomerang ( Figure 12-5 ). You must practice the throwing technique for accuracy and speed. First, align the ta rget by extending the nonthrow ing arm in line with the mid- to lower-section of the target. Slowly and repeatedly raise the throwing arm up and back until the throwing stick crosses the back at about a 45-degree an gle or is in line with the nonthrowing hip. Bring"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":" 120 the throwing arm forward until it is ju st slightly above and parallel to the nonthrowing arm. This will be the throwing stick's release point. Practice sl owly and repeatedly to attain accuracy. Figure 12-5. Rabbit Stick ARCHERY EQUIPMENT 12-22. You can make a bow and arrow ( Figure 12-6 ) from materials available in your survival area. To make a bow, use the procedure described in paragraphs 8-53 through 8-56 in Chapter 8. Figure 12-6. Archery Equipment 12-23. While it may be relatively simple to make a bow and arrow, it is not easy to use one. You must practice using it a long time to be reasonably sure that you will hit your target. Also, a field-expedient bow will not last very long before you have to make a new one. For the time and effort involved, you may well decide to use another t ype of field-expedient weapon. BOLA 12-24. The bola is another fi eld-expedient weapon that is easy to make ( Figure 12-7 ). It is especially effective for capturing running game or low-flying fowl in a flock. To use the bola, hold it by the center knot and twirl it above your head. Release the knot so that the bola flies toward your target. When you release the bola, the weighted co rds will separate. Thes e cords will wrap around and immobilize the fowl or animal that you hit."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":" 121 Figure 12-7. Bola CORDAGE AND LASHING 12-25. Many materials are strong enough for use as co rdage and lashing. A number of natural and man- made materials are available in a survival situation. For example, you can make a cotton web belt much more useful by unraveling it. You can then use the string for other purposes (fishing line, thread for sewing, and lashing). NATURAL CORDAGE SELECTION 12-26. Before making cordage, there are a few simple tests you can do to determine you material's suitability. First, pull on a length of the material to test for strength. Next, twist it between your fingers and roll the fibers together. If it withstands this handling and does not snap apart, tie an overhand knot with the fibers and gently tighten. If the knot does not break, the material is usable. Figure 12-8 shows various methods of making cordage. Figure 12-8. Making Lines From Plant Fibers LASHING MATERIAL 12-27. The best natural material for lashing small objects is sinew. You can make sinew from the tendons of large game, such as deer. Remove the tendons fr om the game and dry them completely. Smash the dried tendons so that they separate into fibers. Moisten the fibers and twist them into a continuous strand. If you need stronger lashing material, you can braid th e strands. When you use sinew for small lashings, you do not need knots as the moistened sine w is sticky and it hardens when dry."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":" 122 12-28. You can shred and braid plant fibers from the inner bark of some trees to make cord. You can use the linden, elm, hickory, white oak, mulberry, chestnut , and red and white cedar trees. After you make the cord, test it to be sure it is strong enough for your purpose. You can make these materials stronger by braiding several strands together. 12-29. You can use rawhide for larger lashing jobs. Make rawhide from the skins of medium or large game. After skinning the animal, remove any excess fat and any pieces of meat from the skin. Dry the skin completely. You do not need to stretch it as long as there are no folds to trap moisture. You do not have to remove the hair from the skin. Cut the skin while it is dry. Make cuts about 6 millimeters (1/4 inch) wide. Start from the center of the hide and make one continuous circular cu t, working clockwise to the hide's outer edge. Soak the rawhide for 2 to 4 hours or until it is soft. Use it wet, stretching it as much as possible while applying it. It will be strong and durable when it dries. RUCKSACK CONSTRUCTION 12-30. The materials for constructing a rucksack or pack are almost limitless. You can use wood, bamboo, rope, plant fiber, clothing, animal skins, canva s, and many other materials to make a pack. 12-31. There are several construction techniques for rucksacks. Many are very elaborate, but those that are simple and easy are often the most r eadily made in a survival situation. HORSESHOE PACK 12-32. This pack is simple to make and use and rela tively comfortable to carry over one shoulder. Lay available square-shaped material, su ch as poncho, blanket, or canvas, flat on the ground. Lay items on one edge of the material. Pad the hard items. Roll the material (with th e items) toward the opposite edge and tie both ends securely. Add extra ties along the length of the bundle. You can dr ape the pack over one shoulder with a line connecting the two ends ( Figure 12-9 ). Figure 12-9. Horseshoe Pack SQUARE PACK 12-33. This pack is easy to construc t if rope or cordage is availabl e. Otherwise, you must first make cordage. To make this pack, construct a square fr ame from bamboo, limbs, or sticks. Size will vary for each person and the amount of equipment carried ( Figure 12-10 )."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":" 123 Figure 12-10. Square Pack CLOTHING AND INSULATION 12-34. You can use many materials for clothing and in sulation. Both man-made materials, such as parachutes, and natural materials, su ch as skins and plant materials, are available and offer significant protection. PARACHUTE ASSEMBLY 12-35. Consider the entire parachute assembly as a re source. Use every piece of material and hardware, to include the canopy, suspension lines, connector snaps, and parachute harness. Before disassembling the parachute, consider all of your survival requirements and plan to use different portions of the parachute accordingly. For example, consider shelter requirements, need for a rucksack, and any additional clothing or insulation needs. ANIMAL SKINS 12-36. The selection of animal skins in a survival situ ation will most often be limited to what you manage to trap or hunt. However, if there is an abundance of wildlife, select the hides of larger animals with heavier coats and large fat content. Do not use the skin s of infected or diseased animals if possible. Since they live in the wild, animals are carriers of pests such as ticks, lice, and fleas. Because of these pests, use water to thoroughly clean any skin obtained from any an imal. If water is not ava ilable, at least shake out the skin thoroughly. As with rawhid e, lay out the skin and remove all fat and meat. Dry the skin completely. Use the hindquarter joint areas to make shoe s, mittens, or socks. Wear the hide with the fur to the inside for its insulating factor. PLANT FIBERS 12-37. Several plants are sources of insulation from cold. Cattail is a marshland plant found along lakes, ponds, and the backwaters of rivers. The fuzz on the tops of the stalks forms dead air spaces and makes a"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":" 124 good down-like insulation when placed between two pi eces of material. Milkweed has pollenlike seeds that act as good insulation. The husk fibers from coconuts are very good for weaving ropes and, when dried, make excellent tinder and insulation. COOKING AND EATING UTENSILS 12-38. You can use many materials to make equipm ent for the cooking, eating, and storing of food. Usually all materials can serve some type of purpose when in a survival situation. Bowls 12-39. Use wood, bone, horn, bark, or other similar mate rial to make bowls. To make wooden bowls, use a hollowed out piece of wood that will hold your food and enough wate r to cook it in. Hang the wooden container over the fire and add hot rocks to the water and food. Remove the rocks as they cool and add more hot rocks until your food is cooked. CAUTION Do not use rocks with air pockets, such as limestone and sandstone. They may explode while heating in the fire. 12-40. You can also use this method with containers ma de of bark or leaves. However, these containers will burn above the waterline unless you keep them moist or keep the fire low. 12-41. A section of bamboo also works very well for cooking. Be sure you cut out a section between two sealed joints ( Figure 12-11 ). Figure 12-11. Containers for Boiling Food CAUTION - A sealed section of bamboo will explode if heated because of trapped air and water in the section. "},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":" 125 FORKS, KNIVES, AND SPOONS 12-42. Carve forks, knives, and spoons from nonre sinous woods so that you do not get a wood resin aftertaste or do not taint the f ood. Nonresinous woods include oak, bi rch, and other hardwood trees. NOTE: Do not use those trees that s ecrete a syrup or resinlike liquid on the bark or when cut. POTS 12-43. You can make pots from turtle shells or w ood. As described with bowls, using hot rocks in a hollowed out piece of wood is very effective. Bamboo is the best wood for making cooking containers. 12-44. To use turtle shells, first th oroughly boil the upper porti on of the shell. Then use it to heat food and water over a flame ( Figure 12-11 ). WATER BOTTLES 12-45. Make water bottles from the st omachs of larger animals. Thoroughly flush the stomach out with water, then tie off the bottom. Leave the top open, with some means of fastening it closed. Chapter 13 Desert Survival To survive and evade in arid or desert areas, you must understand and prepare for the environment you will face. You must determine your equipment needs, the tactics you will use, and how the environment will affect you and your tactics. Your survival will depend upon your knowledge of the terrain, basic climatic elements, your ability to cope with these elements, and your will to survive. TERRAIN 13-1. Most arid areas have several types of terrain. The five basic dese rt terrain types are— • Mountainous (high altitude). • Rocky plateau. • Sand dunes. • Salt marshes. • Broken, dissected terrain (\"gebel\" or \"wadi\"). 13-2. Desert terrain makes movement difficult an d demanding. Land navigation will be extremely difficult as there may be very few landmarks. Cover and concealment may be very limited; therefore, the threat of exposure to the enemy remains constant. MOUNTAIN DESERTS 13-3. Scattered ranges or areas of ba rren hills or mountains separated by dry, flat basins characterize mountain deserts. High ground may rise gradually or abr uptly from flat areas to several thousand meters above sea level. Most of the infre quent rainfall occurs on high ground and runs off rapidly in the form of flash floods. These floodwaters erode deep gullies and ravines and deposit sand and gravel around the"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":" 126 edges of the basins. Water rapidly ev aporates, leaving the land as barren as before, although there may be short-lived vegetation. If e nough water enters the basin to compensate for the rate of evaporation, shallow lakes may develop, such as the Great Salt Lake in Utah or the Dead Sea. Most of these lakes have a high salt content. ROCKY PLATEAU DESERTS 13-4. Rocky plateau deserts have rela tively slight relief interspersed with extensive flat areas with quantities of solid or broken rock at or near th e surface. There may be steep-walled, eroded valleys, known as wadis in the Middle East and arroyos or canyons in the United States and Mexico. Although their flat bottoms may be superficia lly attractive as assembly areas, th e narrower valleys can be extremely dangerous to men and material due to flash flooding after rains. The Golan Heights is an example of a rocky plateau desert. SANDY OR DUNE DESERTS 13-5. Sandy or dune deserts are extensive flat areas covered with sand or gr avel. \"Flat\" is a relative term, as some areas may contain sand dunes that are over 300 meters (1,000 feet) high and 16 to 24 kilometers (10 to 15 miles) long. Trafficability in such terrain will depend on the windward or leeward slope of the dunes and the texture of the sand. However, other ar eas may be flat for 3,000 meters (10,000 feet) and more. Plant life may vary from none to scrub over 2 mete rs (7 feet) high. Examples of this type of desert include the edges of the Sahara, the empty quarter of the Arabian Dese rt, areas of California and New Mexico, and the Kalahari in South Africa. SALT MARSHES 13-6. Salt marshes are flat, desolate areas, sometimes studded with clumps of grass but devoid of other vegetation. They occur in arid areas where rainwater ha s collected, evaporated, and left large deposits of alkali salts and water with a high sa lt concentration. The water is so salty it is undrinkable. A crust that may be 2.5 to 30 centimeters (1 to 12 inches) thick forms over the saltwater. 13-7. In arid areas, there are salt marshes hundreds of kilometers square. These areas usually support many insects, most of which bite. Avoid salt marshes. This type of terrain is highly corrosive to boots, clothing, and skin. A good example is the Shatt al Arab waterway along the Iran-Iraq border. BROKEN TERRAIN 13-8. All arid areas contain broken or highly dissected terrai n. Rainstorms that erode soft sand and carve out canyons form this terrain. A wadi may range from 3 meters (10 feet) wide and 2 meters (7 feet) deep to several hundred meters wide and deep. The directi on it takes varies as much as its width and depth. It twists and turns and forms a mazelike pattern. A wadi will give you good cover and concealment, but do not try to move through it because it is very difficult terrain to negotiate. ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS 13-9. Surviving and evading the enemy in an arid area depends on what you know and how prepared you are for the environmental conditions you will face. De termine what equipment you will need, the tactics you will use, and the environment's impact on them and you."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":" 127 13-10. In a desert area there are seven envi ronmental factors that you must consider— • Low rainfall. • Intense sunlight and heat. • Wide temperature range. • Sparse vegetation. • High mineral content near ground surface. • Sandstorms. • Mirages. LOW RAINFALL 13-11. Low rainfall is the most obvious environmental factor in an arid area. Some desert areas receive less than 10 centimeters (4 inches) of rain annually, and this rain comes in brief torrents that quickly run off the ground surface. You cannot survive long without water in high desert temperatures. In a desert survival situation, you must first consider the amount of water you have and other water sources. INTENSE SUNLIGHT AND HEAT 13-12. Intense sunlight and heat are present in all ar id areas. Air temperature can rise as high as 60 degrees C (140 degrees F) during the day. Heat gain results from direct sunlight, hot blowing sand-laden winds, reflective heat (the sun's ra ys bouncing off the sand), and conductive heat from direct contact with the desert sand and rock ( Figure 13-1 ). Figure 13-1. Types of Heat Gain"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":" 128 13-13. The temperature of desert sand and rock typical ly range from 16 to 22 degrees C (30 to 40 degrees F) more than that of the air. Fo r instance, when the air temperature is 43 degrees C (110 degrees F), the sand temperature may be 60 degrees C (140 degrees F). 13-14. Intense sunlight and heat in crease the body's need for water. To conserve your body fluids and energy, you will need a shelter to redu ce your exposure to the heat of th e day. Travel at night to lessen your use of water. 13-15. Radios and sensitive items of equipment exposed to direct intense sunlight will malfunction. WIDE TEMPERATURE RANGE 13-16. Temperatures in arid areas may get as high as 55 degrees C (130 degrees F) during the day and as low as 10 degrees C (50 degrees F) during the night. The drop in temperature at night occurs rapidly and will chill a person who lacks warm clothing and is una ble to move about. The cool evenings and nights are the best times to work or trav el. If your plan is to rest at night , you will find a wool sweater, long underwear, and a wool stocking cap extremely helpful. SPARSE VEGETATION 13-17. Vegetation is sparse in arid areas. You wi ll therefore have trouble finding shelter and camouflaging your movements. During daylight hours, large areas of terrain are visible and easily controlled by a small opposing force. 13-18. If traveling in hostil e territory, follow the principles of desert camouflage: • Hide or seek shelter in dry washes (wadis) wi th thicker growths of ve getation and cover from oblique observation. • Use the shadows cast from brush, rocks, or outcro ppings. The temperature in shaded areas will be 11 to 17 degrees C (52 to 63 degrees F) cooler than the air temperature. • Cover objects that will reflect the light from the sun. 13-19. Before moving, survey the area for sites that provide cover and concealment. You will have trouble estimating distance. The emptiness of desert te rrain causes most people to underestimate distance by a factor of three: What appears to be 1 kilometer (1 /2 mile) away is really 3 kilometers (1 3/4 miles) away. HIGH MINERAL CONTENT 13-20. All arid regions have areas where the surface so il has a high mineral content (borax, salt, alkali, and lime). Material in contact with this soil wears out quickly, and water in these areas is extremely hard and undrinkable. Wetting your uniform in such water to cool off may cause a skin rash. The Great Salt Lake area in Utah is an example of this type of mi neral-laden water and soil. There is little or no plant life; therefore, shelter is hard to find. Avoid these areas if possible. SANDSTORMS 13-21. Sandstorms (sand-laden winds) occu r frequently in most deserts. The Seistan desert wind in Iran and Afghanistan blows constantly for up to 120 days. Within Saudi Arabia, winds typically range from"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":" 129 3.2 to 4.8 kilometers per hour (kph) (2 to 3 miles per hour [mph]) and can reach 112 to 128 kph (67 to 77 mph) in early afternoon. Expect major sandsto rms and dust storms at least once a week. 13-22. The greatest danger is gettin g lost in a swirling wall of sand. Wear goggles and cover your mouth and nose with cloth. If natural shelte r is unavailable, mark your directi on of travel, lie down, and sit out the storm. 13-23. Dust and wind-blown sand interf ere with radio transmissions. Ther efore, be ready to use other means for signaling, such as pyrotechnics, signal mirrors, or marker panels, if available. MIRAGES 13-24. Mirages are optical phenomena caused by the refraction of light through h eated air rising from a sandy or stony surface. They occur in the interior of the desert about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the coast. They make objects that are 1.5 kilometers (1 mile) or more away appear to move. 13-25. This mirage effect makes it difficult for you to identify an object from a distance. It also blurs distant range contours so much that you feel surrounded by a sheet of wa ter from which elevations stand out as \"islands.\" 13-26. The mirage effect makes it hard for a person to identify targets, estimate range, and see objects clearly. However, if you can get to high ground (3 meters [10 feet] or more above the desert floor), you can get above the superheated air cl ose to the ground and overcome the mirage effect. Mirages make land navigation difficult because they obs cure natural features. You can survey the area at dawn, dusk, or by moonlight when there is little likelihood of mirage. 13-27. Light levels in desert areas are more intens e than in other geographic areas. Moonlit nights are usually crystal clear, winds die down, haze and glare di sappear, and visibility is excellent. You can see lights, red flashlights, and blackout lights at great distan ces. Sound carries very far. 13-28. Conversely, during nights with little moonlight, vi sibility is extremely poor. Traveling is extremely hazardous. You must avoid getting lost, falling into ravines, or stumbling into enemy positions. Movement during such a night is practical only if you have a compa ss and have spent the day resting, observing, and memorizing the terra in, and selecting your route. NEED FOR WATER 13-29. The subject of man and water in the desert has generated considerable interest and confusion since the early days of World War II when the U.S. Army wa s preparing to fight in North Africa. At one time, the U.S. Army thought it could condition men to do w ith less water by progressively reducing their water supplies during training. They called it water disc ipline. It caused hundreds of heat casualties. 13-30. A key factor in desert surv ival is understanding the relations hip between physi cal activity, air temperature, and water consumption. The body requires a certain amount of water for a certain level of activity at a certain temperature. For example, a pe rson performing hard work in the sun at 43 degrees C (109 degrees F) requires 19 liters (5 gallons) of water daily. Lack of the required amount of water causes a rapid decline in an individual's ability to ma ke decisions and to perform tasks efficiently."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":" 130 13-31. Your body's normal temperature is 36.9 degrees C (98.6 degrees F). Your body gets rid of excess heat (cools off) by sweating. The warmer your body b ecomes—whether caused by work, exercise, or air temperature—the more you sweat. The more you sweat, the more moisture you lose. Sweating is the principal cause of water loss. If you stop sweating dur ing periods of high air temperature and heavy work or exercise, you will quickly develop heat stroke. This is an emer gency that requires immediate medical attention. 13-32. Figure 13-2 shows daily water requirements for various levels of work. Understanding how the air temperature and your physical activity affect your water requirements allows you to take measures to get the most from your water supply. These measures are— • Find shade! Get out of the sun! • Place something between you and the hot ground. • Limit your movements! • Conserve your sweat. Wear your complete uniform to include T-shirt. Roll the sleeves down, cover your head, and protect your ne ck with a scarf or similar it em. These steps will protect your body from hot-blowing winds and the direct rays of the sun. Your clothing will absorb your sweat, keeping it against your skin so that you gain its full cooling effect. By stay ing in the shade quietly, fully clothed, not talking, keeping your mouth closed, and breathing through your nose, your water requirement for survival drops dramatically. • If water is scarce, do not eat. Food requires wate r for digestion; therefore, eating food will use water that you need for cooling. "},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":" 131 Figure 13-2. Daily Water Requirements for Three Levels of Activity 13-33. Thirst is not a reliable guide for your need for wa ter. A person who uses thir st as a guide will drink only two-thirds of his daily water requirement. To prevent this \"voluntary\" dehydration, use the following guide: • At temperatures below 38 degrees C (100 degr ees F), drink 0.5 liter of water every hour. • At temperatures above 38 degrees C (100 degr ees F), drink 1 liter of water every hour. 13-34. Drinking water at regular in tervals helps your body remain c ool and decreases sweating. Even when your water supply is low, sipping water consta ntly will keep your body cool er and reduce water loss through sweating. Conserve your fluids by reducing activity during the heat of day. Do not ration your water! If you try to ration water, you sta nd a good chance of becoming a heat casualty. HEAT CASUALTIES 13-35. Your chances of becoming a heat casualty as a surv ivor are great, due to in jury, stress, and lack of critical items of equipment. Follo wing are the major types of heat ca sualties and their treatment when little water and no medical help are available. HEAT CRAMPS 13-36. The loss of salt due to excessive sweating causes heat cramps. Symptoms are moderate to severe muscle cramps in legs, arms, or abdomen. These symp toms may start as a mild muscular discomfort. You should now stop all activity, get in th e shade, and drink water. If you fa il to recognize the early symptoms and continue your physical activity, you will have seve re muscle cramps and pain. Treat as for heat exhaustion, below. HEAT EXHAUSTION 13-37. A large loss of body water and salt causes heat exhaustion. Symptoms are headache, mental confusion, irritability, excessive sweating, weakness, dizziness, cramps , and pale, moist, cold (clammy) skin. Immediately get the patient under shade. Make him lie on a stretcher or similar item about 45 centimeters (18 inches) off the ground. Loosen his clot hing. Sprinkle him with water and fan him. Have him drink small amounts of water every 3 minutes. Ensure he stays quiet and rests. HEAT STROKE 13-38. An extreme loss of water and salt and your body's in ability to cool itself can cause heat stroke. The patient may die if not cooled imme diately. Symptoms are the lack of sweat, hot and dry skin, headache, dizziness, fast pulse, nausea and vom iting, and mental confusion leading to unconsciousness. Immediately get the person to shade. Lay him on a stretcher or similar item about 45 centimeters (18 inches) off the ground. Loosen his clothing. Pour water on him (it does not matter if the water is polluted or brackish) and fan him. Massage his arms, legs, and body. If he regains consciousness, let him drink small amounts of water every 3 minutes. PRECAUTIONS"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":" 132 13-39. In a desert survival and evas ion situation, it is unlikely that you will have a medic or medical supplies with you to treat heat injuri es. Therefore, take extra care to avoid heat injuries. Rest during the day. Work during the cool evenings and nights. Use the buddy system to watch for heat injury. Observe the following guidelines: • Make sure you tell someone where you are going and when you will return. • Watch for signs of heat injury. If someone co mplains of tiredness or wanders away from the group, he may be a heat casualty. • Drink water at least once an hour. • Get in the shade when resting; do not lie directly on the ground. • Do not take off your shirt and work during the day. • Check the color of your urine. A light color m eans you are drinking enough water, a dark color means you need to drink more. DESERT HAZARDS 13-40. There are several hazards unique to desert surv ival. These include insects, snakes, thorned plants and cacti, contaminated water, sunburn, eye irritation, and climatic stress. 13-41. Insects of almost every type abound in the desert . Man, as a source of water and food, attracts lice, mites, wasps, and flies. They are extremely unpleasan t and may carry diseases. Old buildings, ruins, and caves are favorite habitats of spiders, scorpions, centipedes, lice, and mites. These areas provide protection from the elements and also attract other wild life. Therefore, take extra care when staying in these areas. Wear gloves at all times in the desert. Do not place your hands anywhere without first looking to see what is there. Visually in spect an area before sitting or ly ing down. When you get up, shake out and inspect your boots and clothing. All dese rt areas have snakes. They inhab it ruins, native villages, garbage dumps, caves, and natural rock outcroppings that o ffer shade. Never go barefoot or walk through these areas without carefully insp ecting them for snakes. Pay attention to where you place your feet and hands. Most snakebites result from stepping on or handling snakes. Avoid them. Once you see a snake, give it a wide berth. Chapter 14 Tropical Survival Most people think of the tropics as a huge and forbi dding tropical rain forest through which every step taken must be hacked out, and where every inch of th e way is crawling with danger. Actually, over half of the land in the tropics is cultivated in some way. A knowledge of field skills, the ability to improvise, a nd the application of the pr inciples of survival will increase the prospects of survival. Do not be afraid of being alone in th e jungle; fear will lead to panic. Panic will lead to exhaustion and decrease your chance of survival. Everything in the jungle thrives, including disease germs and parasites that breed at an alarming rate. Nature will provide water, food, and pl enty of materials to build shelters. Indigenous peoples have lived for millennia by hunti ng and gathering. However, it will take an outsider some time to get used to the conditions a nd the nonstop activity of tropical survival."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":" 133 TROPICAL WEATHER 14-1. High temperatures, heavy rainfall, and oppressive humidity characterize equatorial and subtropical regions, except at high altitudes. At low altitudes, temperature variati on is seldom less than 10 degrees C (50 degrees F) and is often more than 35 degrees C (95 degrees F). At alti tudes over 1,500 meters (4,921 feet), ice often forms at night. Th e rain has a cooling effect, but wh en it stops, the temperature soars. 14-2. Rainfall is heavy, often with thunder and ligh tning. Sudden rain beats on the tree canopy, turning trickles into raging torrents and cau sing rivers to rise. Just as suddenly, the rain st ops. Violent storms may occur, usually toward the end of the summer months. 14-3. Hurricanes, cyclones, and typhoons develop over the sea and rush inland, causing tidal waves and devastation ashore. In choosing campsites, make su re you are above any potential flooding. Prevailing winds vary between winter and summer. The dr y season has rain once a day and the monsoon has continuous rain. In Southeast Asia, winds from the I ndian Ocean bring the monsoon, but the area is dry when the wind blows from the landmass of China. 14-4. Tropical day and night are of e qual length. Darkness falls quickly and daybreak is just as sudden. JUNGLE TYPES 14-5. There is no standard jungle. The tropical area may be any of the following: • Rain forests. • Secondary jungles. • Semievergreen seasonal and monsoon forests. • Scrub and thorn forests. • Savannas. • Saltwater swamps. • Freshwater swamps. TROPICAL RAIN FORESTS 14-6. The climate varies little in ra in forests. You find these forests across the equator in the Amazon and Congo basins, parts of Indonesia, and several Pacific is lands. Up to 3.5 meters (12 feet) of rain falls throughout the year. Temperatures range from about 32 degrees C (90 degrees F) in the day to 21 degrees C (70 degrees F) at night. 14-7. There are five layers of vegetation in this jungle ( Figure 14-1 ). Where untouched by man, jungle trees rise from buttress roots to heights of 60 meters (198 feet). Below them, smaller trees produce a canopy so thick that little light reach es the jungle floor. Seedlings str uggle beneath them to reach light, and masses of vines and lianas twine up to the sun. Ferns, mosses, and herbaceous plants push through a thick carpet of leaves, and a great variety of fungi grow on leaves and fallen tree trunks."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":" 134 Figure 14-1. Five Layers of Tropical Rain Forest Vegetation 14-8. Because of the lack of light on the jungle floor , there is little undergrowth to hamper movement, but dense growth limits visibility to about 50 meters (165 feet). You can easily lose your sense of direction in this jungle, and it is extremel y hard for aircraft to see you. SECONDARY JUNGLES 14-9. Secondary jungle is very similar to rain forest . Prolific growth, where s unlight penetrates to the jungle floor, typifies this type of forest. Such growth happens ma inly along riverbanks, on jungle fringes, and where man has cleared rain forest. When aba ndoned, tangled masses of vegetation quickly reclaim these cultivated areas. You can often find cu ltivated food plants among this vegetation. SEMIEVERGREEN SEASONAL AND MONSOON FORESTS 14-10. The characteristics of the Am erican and African semievergreen seasonal forests correspond with those of the Asian monsoon forests. The characteristics are as follows: • Their trees fall into two stories of tree strata. Th ose in the upper story ra nge from 18 to 24 meters (60 to 79 feet); those in th e lower story range from 7 to 13 meters (23 to 43 feet). • The diameter of the trees averages 0.5 meter (2 feet). • Their leaves fall during a seasonal drought. 14-11. Except for the sago, nipa, and coconut palms, the sa me edible plants grow in these areas as in the tropical rain forests. 14-12. You find these forests in portions of Columb ia and Venezuela and the Amazon basin in South America; in portions of southeast coastal Kenya, Tanzania, and Mozambique in Africa; in Northeastern India, much of Burma, Thailand, Indochina, Java, and parts of other Indonesian islands in Asia. TROPICAL SCRUB AND THORN FORESTS 14-13. The chief characteristics of tropical scrub and thorn forests are as follows: • There is a definite dry season. • Trees are leafless during the dry season. • The ground is bare except for a few tufted plants in bunches; grasses are uncommon. • Plants with thorns predominate. • Fires occur frequently."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":" 135 14-14. You find tropical scrub and thor n forests on the west coast of Mexico, the Yucatan peninsula, Venezuela, and Brazil; on the northwest coast and central parts of Africa; and in Turkestan and India in Asia. 14-15. Within the tropical scrub and thorn forest areas , you will find it hard to obtain food plants during the dry season. During the rainy season, plants are considerably more abundant. TROPICAL SAVANNAS 14-16. General characteristics of the savanna are that it— • Is found within the tropical zones in South America and Africa. • Looks like a broad, grassy meadow, with trees spaced at wide intervals. • Frequently has red soil. • Grows scattered trees that usually appear stunted and gnarl ed like apple trees. Palms also occur on savannas. 14-17. You find savannas in parts of Venezuela, Brazil, and the Guianas in South America. In Africa, you find them in the southern Sahara (north-central Cameroon and Gabon and southern Sudan), Benin, Togo, most of Nigeria, northeastern Republic of Congo, nor thern Uganda, western Kenya, part of Malawi, part of Tanzania, southern Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and western Madagascar. SALTWATER SWAMPS 14-18. Saltwater swamps are common in coastal areas su bject to tidal flooding. Ma ngrove trees thrive in these swamps. Mangrove trees can reach heights of 12 meters (39 feet). Their tangled roots are an obstacle to movement. Visibility in this type of swamp is poor, and movement is extremely difficult. Sometimes, streams that you can raft form channels, but you usually must travel on foot through this swamp. 14-19. You find saltwater swamps in West Africa, Mada gascar, Malaysia, the Paci fic islands, Central and South America, and at the mouth of the Ganges River in India. The swamps at the mouths of the Orinoco and Amazon rivers and rivers of Guyana consist of mud and trees that offe r little shade. Tides in saltwater swamps can vary as much as 12 meters (3 feet). 14-20. Everything in a saltwater swam p may appear hostile to you, from leeches and insects to crocodiles and caimans. Avoid the dangerous animals in this swamp. 14-21. Avoid this swamp altogether if you can. If there are water channels through it, you may be able to use a raft to escape. FRESHWATER SWAMPS 14-22. You find freshwater swamps in low-lying inla nd areas. Their characterist ics are masses of thorny undergrowth, reeds, grasses, and occasional short palm s that reduce visibility and make travel difficult. There are often islands that dot thes e swamps, allowing you to get out of the water. Wildlife is abundant in these swamps. TRAVEL THROUGH JUNGLE AREAS"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":" 136 14-23. With practice, movement through thick underg rowth and jungle can be done efficiently. Always wear long sleeves to avoi d cuts and scratches. 14-24. To move easily, you must deve lop \"jungle eye,\" that is, you shoul d not concentrate on the pattern of bushes and trees to your immediate front. You mu st focus on the jungle fu rther out and find natural breaks in the foliage. Look through the jungle, not at it. Stop and stoop down occasionally to look along the jungle floor. This action may reveal game trails that you can follow. 14-25. Stay alert and move slowly and steadily through dense forest or ju ngle. Stop periodically to listen and take your bearings. Use a mach ete to cut through dense vegetati on, but do not cut unnecessarily or you will quickly wear yourself out. If using a machete, stroke upward wh en cutting vines to reduce noise because sound carries long distances in the jungle. Us e a stick to part the ve getation. Using a stick will also help dislodge biting ants, spiders, or snakes. Do not grasp at brush or vines when climbing slopes; they may have irritating spines or sharp thorns. 14-26. Many jungle and forest animals follow game trails . These trails wind and cross, but frequently lead to water or clearings. Use these trails if they lead in your desired direction of travel. 14-27. In many countries, electric an d telephone lines run fo r miles through sparse ly inhabited areas. Usually, the right-of-way is clear en ough to allow easy travel. When traveling along these lines, be careful as you approach transformer and relay stations. In enemy territory, they may be guarded. 14-28. Movement through jungles or dense vegetation re quires you to constantly be alert and aware of your surroundings. The following travel tips will help you succeed: • Pinpoint your initial location as accurately as po ssible to determine a gene ral line of travel to safety. If you do not have a compass, use a field-expedient di rection-finding method. • Take stock of water supplies and equipment. • Move in one direction, but not necessarily in a st raight line. Avoid obstacl es. In enemy territory, take advantage of natural cover and concealment. • Move smoothly through the jungle. Do not blunde r through it since you will get many cuts and scratches. Turn your shoulders, shift your hips, bend your body, and shorten or lengthen your stride as necessary to slide between the undergrowth. IMMEDIATE CONSIDERATIONS 14-29. There is less likelihood of your rescue from ben eath a dense jungle canopy th an in other survival situations. You will probably have to travel to reach safety. 14-30. If you are the victim of an aircraft crash, the mo st important items to take with you from the crash site are a machete, a compass, a firs t aid kit, and a parachute or other ma terial for use as mosquito netting and shelter. 14-31. Take shelter from tropical rain, sun, and insects. Malaria-carrying mosquitoes and other insects are immediate dangers, so protect yourself against bites. 14-32. Do not leave the crash area w ithout carefully blazing or marki ng your route. Use your compass. Know what directi on you are taking."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":" 137 14-33. In the tropics, even the smal lest scratch can quickly become da ngerously infected. Promptly treat any wound, no matter how minor. WATER PROCUREMENT 14-34. Although water is abundant in most tropical environments, you ma y have trouble finding it. If you do find water, it may not be safe to drink. Some of the many sources are vines, roots, palm trees, and condensation. You can sometimes follow animals to water. Often you can get nearly clear water from muddy streams or lakes by digging a hole in sandy soil about 1 meter (3 feet) from the bank. Water will seep into the hole. You must purify a ny water obtained in this manner. ANIMALS—SIGNS OF WATER 14-35. Animals can often lead you to water. Most anim als require water regularly. Grazing animals, such as deer, are usually never far from water and usually drink at dawn and dusk. Converging game trails often lead to water. Carnivores (m eat eaters) are not reliable indicators of water. They get moisture from the animals they eat and can go without water for long periods. 14-36. Birds can sometimes also lead you to water. Gr ain eaters, such as finc hes and pigeons, are never far from water. They drink at dawn and dusk. When they fly straight and low, th ey are heading for water. When returning from water, they ar e full and will fly from tree to tree, resting frequently. Do not rely on water birds to lead you to water. They fly long dist ances without stopping. Hawks, eagles, and other birds of prey get liquids from their victims; you cannot use them as a water indicator. 14-37. Insects, especially bees, can be good indicators of water. Bees seldom range more than 6 kilometers (4 miles) from their nests or hives. They will usually have a water source in this range. Ants need water. A column of ants marching up a tree is going to a small reservoir of trapped water. You find such reservoirs even in arid areas. Most flies, esp ecially the European mason fly, stay within 100 meters (330 feet) of water. This fly is easily recognized by its ir idescent green body. 14-38. Human tracks will usua lly lead to a well, bore hole, or soak. Scrub or rocks may cover it to reduce evaporation. Replace the cover after use. WATER—FROM PLANTS 14-39. You will encounter many types of vegetation in a survival situation depending upon your area. Plants such as vines, roots, and pa lm trees are good sources of water. Vines 14-40. Vines with rough bark and shoots about 5 centimet ers (2 inches) thick can be a useful source of water. You must learn by experience which are the water-bearing vines, because not all have drinkable water. Some may even have a poisonous sap. The poisonous ones yield a sticky, milky sap when cut. Nonpoisonous vines will give a clear fluid. Some vines cause a skin irritation on contact; therefore let the liquid drip into your mouth, rather than put your mouth to the vine . Preferably, use some type of container. Use the procedure described in Chapter 6 to obtain water from a vine. Roots"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":" 138 14-41. In Australia, the water tree, desert oak, and bloodwood have roots near the surface. Pry these roots out of the ground and cut them into 30-centimeter (1-f oot) lengths. Remove the bark and suck out the moisture, or shave the root to a pulp and squeeze it over your mouth. Palm Trees 14-42. The buri, coconut, and nipa palms all contain a sugary fluid that is very good to drink. To obtain the liquid, bend a flowering stalk of one of these pa lms downward, and cut off its tip. If you cut a thin slice off the stalk every 12 hours, th e flow will renew, making it possible to collect up to a liter per day. Nipa palm shoots grow from the base, so that you can work at ground level. On grown trees of other species, you may have to climb them to reach a fl owering stalk. Milk from coconuts has a large water content, but may contain a strong la xative in ripe nuts. Drinking too mu ch of this milk may cause you to lose more fluid than you drink. WATER—FROM CONDENSATION 14-43. Often it requires too much effort to dig for root s containing water. It may be easier to let a plant produce water for you in the form of condensation. Tying a clear plasti c bag around a green leafy branch will cause water in the leaves to evaporate and condens e in the bag. Placing cut vegetation in a plastic bag will also produce condensation. This is a solar still ( Chapter 6 ). FOOD 14-44. Food is usually abundant in a tropical survival s ituation. To obtain animal food, use the procedures outlined in Chapter 8 . 14-45. In addition to animal food, you will have to s upplement your diet with edible plants. The best places to forage are the banks of streams and rivers. Wherever the sun penetrates the jungle, there will be a mass of vegetation, but riverbanks may be the most accessible areas. 14-46. If you are weak, do not expend energy climbing or felling a tree for food. There are more easily obtained sources of food nearer the ground. Do not pick more food than you need. Food spoils rapidly in tropical conditions. Leave food on the growing pl ant until you need it, and eat it fresh. 14-47. There are an almost unlimited number of edib le plants from which to choose. Unless you can positively identify these plants, it may be safer at firs t to begin with palms, bamboos, and common fruits. Appendix B provides detailed descriptions and photographs of some of the most common food plants located in a tropical zone. POISONOUS PLANTS 14-48. The proportion of poisonous plants in tropical regions is no greater than in any other area of the world. However, it may appear that most plants in the tropics are poisonous because of the great density of plant growth in some tropical areas ( Appendix C ). Chapter 15 Cold Weather Survival"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":" 139 One of the most difficult survival situations is a co ld weather scenario. Rememb er, cold weather is an adversary that can be as dangerous as an enemy soldier. Every time you venture into the cold, you are pitting yourself against the elements . With a little knowledge of the environment, proper plans, and appropriate equipment, you can overcome the elements . As you remove one or more of these factors, survival becomes increasingly difficult. Remember, winter weather is hi ghly variable. Prepare yourself to adapt to blizzard conditions even during sunny and clear weather. Cold is a far greater threat to surv ival than it appears. It decreases your ability to think and weakens your will to do anything except to get warm. Cold is an insidious enemy; as it numbs the mind and body, it subdues the will to survive. Cold makes it very easy to forget your ultimate goal—to survive. COLD REGIONS AND LOCATIONS 15-1. Cold regions include arctic and subarctic ar eas and areas immediately adjoining them. You can classify about 48 percent of the Northern Hemisphe re's total landmass as a cold region due to the influence and extent of air temperatures. Ocean cu rrents affect cold weathe r and cause large areas normally included in the temperate zone to fall within the cold regions during winter periods. Elevation also has a marked effect on defining cold regions. 15-2. Within the cold weather regions, you may face two types of cold weather environments—wet or dry. Knowing in which environment your area of opera tions falls will affect planning and execution of a cold weather operation. WET COLD WEATHER ENVIRONMENTS 15-3. Wet cold weather conditions exist when the aver age temperature in a 24-hour period is -10 degrees C (14 degrees F) or above. Character istics of this condition are freezing during the colder night hours and thawing during the day. Alt hough the temperatures are warmer during this condition, the terrain is usually very sloppy due to slush and mud. You must concentr ate on protecting yourself from the wet ground and from freezing rain or wet snow. DRY COLD WEATHER ENVIRONMENTS 15-4. Dry cold weather conditions ex ist when the average temperature in a 24-hour period remains below -10 degrees C (14 degrees F). Even though the temperatures in this cond ition are much lower than normal, you do not have to contend with the freezing and thaw ing. In these conditions, you need more layers of inner clothing to protect you from temperatures as low as -60 de grees C (-76 degrees F). Extremely hazardous conditions exist when wind and low temperature combine. WINDCHILL 15-5. Windchill increases the hazards in cold regions. Windchill is the effect of moving air on exposed flesh. For instance, with a 27.8-kph (15-knot) wind and a temperature of -10 degrees C (14 degrees F), the equivalent windchill te mperature is -23 degr ees C (-9 degrees F). Figure 15-1 gives the windchill factors for various temperatures and wind speeds."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":" 140 Figure 15-1. Windchill Table 15-6. Remember, even when there is no wind, you w ill create the equivalent wind by skiing, running, being towed on skis behind a vehicle, or wo rking around aircraft th at produce windblasts. BASIC PRINCIPLES OF COLD WEATHER SURVIVAL 15-7. It is more difficult for you to satisfy your basic water, food, and sh elter needs in a cold environment than in a warm environment. Even if you have the basic requirements, you must also have adequate protective clothing and the will to surv ive. The will to survive is as important as the basic needs. There have been incidents when trained and well-equipped i ndividuals have not survived cold weather situations because they lacked the will to live. Conversely, this will has sustaine d individuals less well-trained and equipped. 15-8. There are many different items of cold weather equipment and clothing issued by the U.S. Army today. Specialized units may have access to newer, lightweight gear such as polypropylene underwear, Gore-Tex outerwear and boots, and other special equipm ent. However, the older gear will keep you warm as long as you apply a few cold weather principles. If the newer types of clothing are available, use them. If not, then your clothing should be entirely wool, with the po ssible exception of a windbreaker. 15-9. You must not only have enough clothing to protect you from the cold, you must also know how to maximize the warmth you get from it. For example, always keep your head covered. You can lose 40 to 45 percent of body heat from an unprotected head and even more from the unprotected neck, wrist, and ankles. These areas of the body are good radiators of heat and have very li ttle insulating fat. The brain is very susceptible to cold and can stand the leas t amount of cooling. Because there is much blood"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":" 141 circulation in the head, most of which is on the surf ace, you can lose heat quickly if you do not cover your head. 15-10. There are four basic principles to follow to keep warm. An easy way to remember these basic principles is to use the word COLDER as follows: • C-Keep clothing clean . This principle is always important for sanitation a nd comfort. In winter, it is also important from the standpo int of warmth. Clothes matted with dirt and grease lose much of their insulation value. Heat can escape more easily from the body through the clothing's crushed or filled up air pockets. • O-Avoid overheating . When you get too hot, you sweat an d your clothing absorbs the moisture. This affects your warmth in two ways: dampness decreases the insulation quality of clothing, and as sweat evaporates, your body cool s. Adjust your clothing so that you do not sweat. Do this by partially opening your parka or jacket, by removi ng an inner layer of clothing, by removing heavy outer mittens, or by throwing back your parka hood or changing to lighter headgear. The head and hands act as efficient heat dissipaters when overheated. • L-Wear your clothing loose and in layers. Wear ing tight clothing and f ootgear restricts blood circulation and invites cold injur y. It also decreases the volume of air trapped between the layers, reducing its insulating value. Seve ral layers of lightweight clot hing are better than one equally thick layer of clothing, because the layers have dead airspace between them. The dead airspace provides extra insulation. Also, laye rs of clothing allow you to take off or add clothing layers to prevent excessive sweating or to increase warmth. • D-Keep clothing dry . In cold temperatures, your inner laye rs of clothing can become wet from sweat and your outer layer, if not water repellent, can become wet from snow and frost melted by body heat. Wear water repellent ou ter clothing, if available. It will shed most of the water collected from melting snow and frost. Before en tering a heated shelter, brush off the snow and frost. Despite the precautions you take, there w ill be times when you cannot keep from getting wet. At such times, drying your clothing may become a major problem. On the march, hang your damp mittens and socks on your rucksack. Sometimes in freezing temperatures, the wind and sun will dry this clothing. You can also place damp so cks or mittens, unfolded, near your body so that your body heat can dry them. In a campsite, hang damp clothing inside the shelter near the top, using drying lines or improvised racks. You may even be able to dry each item by holding it before an open fire. Dry leather items slowl y. If no other means are available for drying your boots, put them between your sleeping bag shell and liner. Your body heat will help to dry the leather. • E-Examine your uniform for worn areas, tears, and cleanliness. • R-Repair your uniform early befo re tears and holes become too large to patch. Improvised sewing kits can be made from bones, plan t fibers, 550 cord, and large thorns. 15-11. A heavy, down-lined sleeping bag is a valuable piece of survival gear in cold weather. Ensure the down remains dry. If wet, it loses a lot of its insulation value. If you do not have a sleeping bag, you can make one out of parachute cloth or similar material a nd natural dry material, such as leaves, pine needles, or moss. Place the dry material between two layers of the material. 15-12. Other important survival items are a knife; waterproof matches in a waterproof container, preferably one with a flint attached; a durable compa ss; map; watch; waterproof ground cloth and cover; flashlight; binoculars; dark glasses; fatty emerge ncy foods; food gathering g ear; and signaling items. 15-13. Remember, a cold weather environment can be very harsh. Give a good deal of thought to selecting the right equipment for surv ival in the cold. If unsure of an item you have never used, test it in"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":" 142 an \"overnight backyard\" environment before venturi ng further. Once you have selected items that are essential for your survival, do not lose them after you enter a cold weather environment. HYGIENE 15-14. Although washing yourself may be impractical and uncomfortable in a cold environment, you must do so. Washing helps prevent skin rashes that can develop into more serious problems. 15-15. In some situations, you may be able to take a snow bath. Take a handful of snow and wash your body where sweat and moisture accumulate, such as unde r the arms and between the legs, and then wipe yourself dry. If possible, wash your feet daily and put on clean, dry socks. Change your underwear at least twice a week. If you are unable to wash your underwear, take it off, shake it, and let it air out for an hour or two. 15-16. If you are using a previously used shelter, ch eck your body and clothing for lice each night. If your clothing has become infested, use insecticide powder if you have any. Otherwise, hang your clothes in the cold, then beat and brush them. This will he lp get rid of the lice, but not the eggs. 15-17. If you shave, try to do so before going to bed. Th is will give your skin a chance to recover before exposing it to the elements. MEDICAL ASPECTS 15-18. When you are healthy, your inner core temperature (torso temperature) remains almost constant at 37 degrees C (98.6 degrees F). Since your limbs and head have less protective body tissue than your torso, their temperatures vary and ma y not reach core temperature. 15-19. Your body has a control system th at lets it react to temperature ex tremes to maintain a temperature balance. There are three main factors that affect th is temperature balance—heat production, heat loss, and evaporation. The difference between the body's core temperature and the environment's temperature governs the heat production rate. Y our body can get rid of heat better than it can produce it. Sweating helps to control the heat balance. Maximum sweating will get rid of heat about as fast as maximum exertion produces it. 15-20. Shivering causes the body to produce heat. It also causes fatigue that, in turn, leads to a drop in body temperature. Air movement around your body affects h eat loss. It has been noted that a naked man exposed to still air at or about 0 de grees C (32 degrees F) can maintain a heat balance if he shivers as hard as he can. However, he can't shiver forever. 15-21. It has also been noted that a man at rest wearing the maximum arctic clothing in a cold environment can keep his internal heat balance du ring temperatures well be low freezing. However, to withstand really cold conditions for any length of time, he will have to become active or shiver. COLD INJURIES 15-22. The best way to deal with in juries and sicknesses is to take measures to prevent them from happening in the first place. Treat any injury or sickne ss that occurs as soon as possible to prevent it from worsening."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":" 143 15-23. The knowledge of signs and symptoms and the use of the buddy system are critical in maintaining health. The following paragraphs explain some cold injuries that can occur. HYPOTHERMIA 15-24. Hypothermia is the lowering of the body temperat ure at a rate faster th an the body can produce heat. Causes of hypothermia may be general exposure or the sudden wetting of the body by falling into a lake or spraying with fuel or other liquids. 15-25. The initial symptom is shivering. This shivering may progress to the point that it is uncontrollable and interferes with an individual' s ability to care for himself. This begins when the body's core temperature falls to about 35.5 degrees C (96 degrees F). When the core temperature reaches 35 to 32 degrees C (95 to 90 degrees F), sluggish thinking, i rrational reasoning, and a fals e feeling of warmth may occur. Core temperatures of 32 to 30 degrees C (90 to 86 degrees F) and below result in muscle rigidity, unconsciousness, and barely detectable signs of life. If the victim's core temperature falls below 25 degrees C (77 degrees F), death is almost certain. 15-26. To treat hypothermia, rewarm the entire body. If there are means available, rewarm the person by first immersing the trunk area only in warm water of 37.7 to 43.3 degrees C (100 to 110 degrees F). CAUTION - Rewarming the total body in a warm wate r bath should be done only in a hospital environment because of the increased risk of cardiac arrest and rewarming shock. 15-27. One of the quickest ways to get heat to the i nner core is to give warm water enemas. However, such an action may not be possible in a survival s ituation. Another method is to wrap the victim in a warmed sleeping bag with another person w ho is already warm; both should be naked. CAUTION - The individual placed in the sleeping bag with the victim could also become a hypothermia victim if left in the bag too long. 15-28. If the person is conscious, give him hot, sweetened fluids. Honey or dextrose are best, but if they are unavailable, sugar, cocoa, or a si milar soluble sweetener may be used. CAUTION - Do not force an unconscious person to drink. 15-29. There are two dangers in treating hypothermia—rewarming t oo rapidly and \"after-drop.\" Rewarming too rapidly can cause the vi ctim to have circulatory problems, resulting in heart failure. After- drop is the sharp body core temperature drop that occurs when taking the victim fr om the warm water. Its probable cause is the retu rn of previously stagnant limb blood to the core (inner torso) area as recirculation occurs. Concentrating on warming the core area and stimulating peripheral circulation will lessen the effects of after-drop. Immers ing the torso in a warm bath, if possible, is the best treatment. FROSTBITE 15-30. This injury is the result of fr ozen tissues. Light frostbite involves only the skin that takes on a dull whitish pallor. Deep frostbite extends to a depth belo w the skin. The tissues become solid and immovable. Your feet, hands, and exposed facial areas are particularly vulnerable to frostbite."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":" 144 15-31. The best frostbite prevention, when you are w ith others, is to use the buddy system. Check your buddy's face often and make sure that he checks your s. If you are alone, periodically cover your nose and lower part of your face with your mittened hand. 15-32. The following pointers will aid you in keeping warm and preventing frostbite when it is extremely cold or when you have less than adequate clothing: • Face. Maintain circulation by \"making faces.\" Warm with your hands. • Ears. Wiggle and move your ears. Warm with your hands. • Hands. Move your hands inside your gloves. Warm by placing your hands close to your body. • Feet. Move your feet and wiggle yo ur toes inside your boots. 15-33. A loss of feeling in your hands and feet is a si gn of frostbite. If you have lost feeling for only a short time, the frostbite is probabl y light. Otherwise, assume the fros tbite is deep. To rewarm a light frostbite, use your hands or mittens to warm your face and ears. Place your hands under your armpits. Place your feet next to your buddy's stomach. A deep fros tbite injury, if thawed and refrozen, will cause more damage than a nonmedically trained person can handle. Figure 15-2 , lists some \"dos and don'ts\" regarding frostbite. Figure 15-2. Frostbite Dos and Don'ts TRENCH FOOT AND IMMERSION FOOT 15-34. These conditions result from many hours or days of exposure to wet or damp conditions at a temperature just above freezing. The symptoms are a sensation of pins and n eedles, tingling, numbness, and then pain. The skin w ill initially appear wet, soggy, white, and shriveled. As it progresses and damage appears, the skin will take on a re d and then a bluish or black discoloration. The feet become cold, swollen, and have a waxy appearance. Walking become s difficult and the feet feel heavy and numb. The nerves and muscles sustain the main damage, but gangren e can occur. In extreme cases, the flesh dies and it may become necessary to have the foot or leg amput ated. The best prevention is to keep your feet dry. Carry extra socks with you in a waterproof packet. You can dry wet socks against your torso (back or chest). Wash your feet and put on dry socks daily. DEHYDRATION 15-35. When bundled up in many layers of clothing during cold weather, you may be unaware that you are losing body moisture. Your heavy clothing absorbs th e moisture that evaporates in the air. You must drink water to replace this loss of flui d. Your need for water is as great in a cold environment as it is in a warm environment ( Chapter 13 ). One way to tell if you are becoming dehydrated is to check the color of"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":" 145 your urine on snow. If your urine makes the snow da rk yellow, you are becoming dehydrated and need to replace body fluids. If it makes the snow light yellow to no color, your body fluids have a more normal balance. COLD DIURESIS 15-36. Exposure to cold increases ur ine output. It also decreases body fl uids that you must replace. SUNBURN 15-37. Exposed skin can become sunburned even when the air temperature is below freezing. The sun's rays reflect at all angles from snow, ice, and wate r, hitting sensitive areas of skin—lips, nostrils, and eyelids. Exposure to the sun results in sunburn more qui ckly at high altitudes than at low altitudes. Apply sunburn cream or lip salve to your face when in the sun. SNOW BLINDNESS 15-38. The reflection of the sun's ultraviolet rays off a snow-covered area causes this condition. The symptoms of snow blindness are a sensation of grit in the eyes, pain in and over the eyes that increases with eyeball movement, red and teary eyes, and a h eadache that intensifies with continued exposure to light. Prolonged exposure to these ra ys can result in permanent eye da mage. To treat snow blindness, bandage your eyes until the symptoms disappear. 15-39. You can prevent snow blindn ess by wearing sunglasses. If you don't have sunglasses, improvise. Cut slits in a piece of cardboard, thin wood, tree bark, or other available material ( Figure 15-3 ). Putting soot under your eyes will he lp reduce shine and glare. Figure 15-3. Improvised Sunglasses CONSTIPATION 15-40. It is very important to reli eve yourself when needed. Do not de lay because of the cold condition. Delaying relieving yourself because of the cold, eating dehydrated foods, drinking too little liquid, and irregular eating habits can cause you to become constipated. Alt hough not disabling, constipation can cause some discomfort. Increase your fluid intake to at least 2 liters above your normal 2 to 3 liters daily intake and, if available, eat fruit and other foods that will loosen the stool. INSECT BITES"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":" 146 15-41. Insect bites can become infected through cons tant scratching. Flies can carry various disease- producing germs. To prevent insect bites, use insect repe llent and netting and w ear proper clothing. See Chapter 11 for information on insect bites and Chapter 4 for treatment. SHELTERS 15-42. Your environment and the equipment you carry wi th you will determine the type of shelter you can build. You can build shelters in wooded areas, open country, and ba rren areas. Wooded areas usually provide the best location, while ba rren areas have only snow as build ing material. Wooded areas provide timber for shelter construction, wood for fire, con cealment from observation, and protection from the wind. NOTE: In extreme cold, do not use metal, such as an ai rcraft fuselage, for shelter. The metal will conduct away from the shelter what little heat you can generate. 15-43. Shelters made from ice or snow usually require tools such as ice axes or saws. You must also expend much time and energy to build such a shelter. Be su re to ventilate an enclosed shelter, especially if you intend to build a fire in it. Always block a shelter' s entrance, if possible, to keep the heat in and the wind out. Use a rucksack or snow block. Construct a shelter no larger than needed. This will reduce the amount of space to heat. A fatal error in cold weathe r shelter construction is making the shelter so large that it steals body heat rath er than helps save it. 15-44. Never sleep directly on the ground. Lay down some pine boughs, grass, or other insulating material to keep the ground from absorbing your body heat. 15-45. Never fall asleep without tu rning out your stove or lamp. Ca rbon monoxide poisoning can result from a fire burning in an unventilat ed shelter. Carbon monoxide is a gr eat danger. It is colorless and odorless. Any time you have an open flame, it may generate carbon monoxide. Always check your ventilation. Even in a ventilated shelter, incomplete combustion can cause carbon monoxide poisoning. Usually, there are no symptoms. Unconsciousness and death can occur without warning. Sometimes, however, pressure at the temples, burning of the ey es, headache, pounding pulse, drowsiness, or nausea may occur. The one characteristic, visible sign of carbon monoxide poisoning is a cherry red coloring in the tissues of the lips, mouth, and inside of the eyelid s. Get into fresh air at onc e if you have any of these symptoms. 15-46. There are several types of field-expedient shelters you can quickly build or employ. Many use snow for insulation. SNOW CAVE SHELTER 15-47. The snow cave shelter ( Figure 15-4 ) is a most effective dwelling be cause of the insulating qualities of snow. Remember that it takes time and energy to bu ild and that you will get we t while building it. First, you need to find a drift about 3 mete rs (10 feet) deep into which you ca n dig. While building this shelter, keep the roof arched for strength and to allow me lted snow to drain down the sides. Build the sleeping platform higher than the entrance. Separate the sleep ing platform from the snow cave's walls or dig a small trench between the platform and the wall. This platform will prevent th e melting snow from wetting you and your equipment. This construction is especially important if you have a good source of heat in the snow cave. Ensure the roof is high enough so that you can sit up on the sleeping platform. Block the entrance with a snow block or other material and use the lower entrance area for cooking. The walls and"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":" 147 ceiling should be at least 30 centimeter s (1 foot) thick. Install a ventilatio n shaft. If you do not have a drift large enough to build a snow cave, you can make a variation of it by piling snow into a mound large enough to dig out. Figure 15-4. Snow Dwellings SNOW TRENCH SHELTER 15-48. The idea behind this shelter ( Figure 15-4 ) is to get you below the snow and wind level and use the snow's insulating qualities. If you ar e in an area of compacted snow, cu t snow blocks and use them as overhead cover. If not, you can use a poncho or other material. Build only one en trance and use a snow block or rucksack as a door. SNOW BLOCK AND PARACHUTE SHELTER 15-49. Use snow blocks for the sides and parachute material for overhead cover ( Figure 15-4 ). If snowfall is heavy, you will have to clear snow from the top at regular intervals to prevent the collapse of the parachute material. SNOW HOUSE OR IGLOO"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":" 148 15-50. In certain areas, the natives frequently use this type of shelter ( Figure 15-4 ) as hunting and fishing shelters. They are efficient shelters but require some practice to make them properly. Also, you must be in an area that is suitable for cutting snow blocks and have the equipment to cut them (snow saw or knife). LEAN-TO SHELTER 15-51. Construct this shelter in th e same manner as for other environments. However, pile snow around the sides for insulation ( Figure 15-5 ). Figure 15-5. Lean-to Made From Natural Shelter FALLEN TREE SHELTER 15-52. To build this shelter, find a fallen tree and dig out the snow underneath it ( Figure 15-6 ). The snow will not be deep under the tree. If you must remove bran ches from the inside, use them to line the floor. Figure 15-6. Fallen Tree as Shelter TREE-PIT SHELTER 15-53. Dig snow out from under a suitable large tree. It will not be as deep near the base of the tree. Use the cut branches to line the shelter. Use a ground sheet as overhead cover to prevent snow from falling off the tree into the shelter. If built prope rly, you can have 360-degree visibility (Chapter 5, Figure 5-12 ). 20-MAN LIFE RAFT 15-54. This raft is the standard overw ater raft on U.S. Air Force aircraft. You can use it as a shelter. Do not let large amounts of snow build up on the overhead protection. If placed in an open area, it also serves as a good signal to overhead aircraft."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":" 149 FIRE 15-55. Fire is especially important in cold weather. It not only provide s a means to prepare food, but also to get warm and to melt snow or ice for water. It also provides you with a significant psychological boost by making you feel a little more secure in your situation. 15-56. Use the techniques described in Chapter 7 to build and light your fire. If you are in enemy territory, remember that the smoke, smell, and light from your fire may reveal your lo cation. Light reflects from surrounding trees or rocks, making even indirect light a source of danger. Smoke tends to go straight up in cold, calm weather, making it a beacon during the da y, but helping to conceal the smell at night. In warmer weather, especially in a wooded area, smoke tends to hug the gr ound, making it less visible in the day, but making its odor spread. 15-57. If you are in enemy territory, cut low tree boughs rather than the entire tree for firewood. Fallen trees are easily seen from the air. 15-58. All wood will burn, but some t ypes of wood create more smoke than others. For instance, coniferous trees that contain resin and tar crea te more and darker smoke than deciduous trees. 15-59. There are few materials to use for fuel in th e high mountainous regions of the arctic. You may find some grasses and moss, but very little. The lower th e elevation, the more fuel available. You may find some scrub willow and small, stunted spruce trees a bove the tree line. On sea ice, fuels are seemingly nonexistent. Driftwood or fats may be the only fuels available to a survivor on the barren coastlines in the arctic and subarctic regions. 15-60. Abundant fuels within the tree line are as follows: • Spruce trees are common in the interior regions. As a conifer, spruce makes a lot of smoke when burned in the spring and summer months. However, it burns almost smoke-free in late fall and winter. • The tamarack tree is also a conifer. It is the only tree of the pine family that loses its needles in the fall. Without its needles, it l ooks like a dead spruce, but it has many knobby buds and cones on its bare branches. When burning, tamarack wood make s a lot of smoke and is excellent for signaling purposes. • Birch trees are deciduous and the wood burns hot and fast, as if soaked with oil or kerosene. Most birches grow near streams and lakes, but occasionally you will find a few on higher ground and away from water. • Willow and alder grow in arctic regions, normally in marsh areas or near lakes and streams. These woods burn hot and fast without much smoke. 15-61. Dried moss, grass, and scrub willow are other materials you can use for fuel. These are usually plentiful near streams in tundras (open, treeless plains). By bundling or twisting grasses or other scrub vegetation to form a large, solid mass, you w ill have a slower burning, more productive fuel. 15-62. If fuel or oil is available from a wrecked vehicle or downed aircra ft, use it for fuel. Leave the fuel in the tank for storage, drawing on the supply only as you need it. Oil congeals in extremely cold temperatures, therefore, drain it from the vehicle or aircraft while st ill warm if there is no danger of explosion or fire. If you have no cont ainer, let the oil drain onto the s now or ice. Scoop up the fuel as you need it."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":" 150 CAUTION - Do not expose flesh to petroleu m, oil, and lubricants in ex tremely cold temperatures. The liquid state of these products is dece ptive in that it can cause frostbite. 15-63. Some plastic products, such as MRE spoons, helmet visors, visor housings, and foam rubber will ignite quickly from a burning match. They will also bur n long enough to help start a fire. For example, a plastic spoon will burn for about 10 minutes. 15-64. In cold weather regions, there are some hazards in using fires, whether to keep warm or to cook. For example— • Fires have been known to burn underground, resurfaci ng nearby. Therefore, do not build a fire too close to a shelter. • In snow shelters, excessive heat will melt the insulating layer of snow that may also be your camouflage. • A fire inside a shelter lacking adequate ve ntilation can resu lt in carbon monoxide poisoning. • A person trying to get warm or to dry clothes may become careless and burn or scorch his clothing and equipment. • Melting overhead snow may get you wet, bury you and your equipment, and possibly extinguish your fire. 15-65. In general, a small fire and some type of stove is the best combination for cooking purposes. A hobo stove ( Figure 15-7 ) is particularly suitable to the arctic. It is easy to make out of a tin can, and it conserves fuel. A bed of hot coals provides the best c ooking heat. Coals from a cr isscross fire will settle uniformly. Make this type of fire by crisscrossing the firewood. A simple crane propped on a forked stick will hold a cooking container over a fire. Figure 15-7. Cooking Fire and Stove 15-66. For heating purposes, a single candle provides enough heat to warm an enclosed shelter. A small fire about the size of a man's hand is ideal for use in enemy territory. It require s very little fuel, yet it generates considerable warmth a nd is hot enough to warm liquids. WATER 15-67. There are many sources of water in the arctic and subarctic. Your locati on and the season of the year will determine where and how you obtain water."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":" 151 15-68. Water sources in arctic and subarctic regions are more sanitary than in other regions due to the climatic and environmental conditions. However, always purify the water before drinking it. During the summer months, the best natural sources of water ar e freshwater lakes, str eams, ponds, rivers, and springs. Water from ponds or lakes may be slightly stagnant but still usable. Running water in streams, rivers, and bubbling springs is usually fresh and suitable for drinking. 15-69. The brownish surface water found in a tundra during the summer is a good source of water. However, you may have to filter the water before purifying it. 15-70. You can melt freshwater ice and snow for water. Completely melt both before putting them in your mouth. Trying to melt ice or snow in your mouth ta kes away body heat and may cause internal cold injuries. If on or near pack ice in the sea, you can use old sea ice to melt for water. In time, sea ice loses its salinity. You can identify this ice by its rounded corners and bluish color. 15-71. You can use body heat to melt snow. Place the snow in a water bag and place the bag between your layers of clothing. This is a slow process, but you can use it on th e move or when you have no fire. NOTE: Do not waste fuel to melt ice or snow when dr inkable water is available from other sources. 15-72. When ice is available, melt it rather than snow. One cup of ice yields more water than one cup of snow. Ice also takes less time to melt. You can melt ice or snow in a water bag, MRE ration bag, tin can, or improvised container by placing the c ontainer near a fire. Begin with a small amount of ice or snow in the container and, as it turns to water, add more ice or snow. 15-73. Another way to melt ice or snow is by putti ng it in a bag made from porous material and suspending the bag near the fire. Place a c ontainer under the bag to catch the water. 15-74. During cold weather, avoid drinking a lot of liquid before going to bed. Crawling out of a warm sleeping bag at night to relieve yourself mean s less rest and more exposure to the cold. 15-75. Once you have water, keep it next to you to prevent refreezing. Also, do not fill your canteen completely. Allowing the water to slos h around will help keep it from freezing. FOOD 15-76. There are several sources of food in the arctic and subarctic regions. The type of food—fish, animal, fowl, or plant—and the ease in obtaining it depend on the time of the year and your location. FISH 15-77. During the summer months, you can easily get fi sh and other water life from coastal waters, streams, rivers, and lakes. Us e the techniques described in Chapter 8 to catch fish. 15-78. The North Atlantic and North Pacific coastal waters are rich in seafood. You can easily find crawfish, snails, clams, oysters, a nd king crab. In areas where there is a great difference between the high and low tidewater levels, you can easily find shellfish at low tide. Dig in the sand on the tidal flats. Look in tidal pools and on offshore reefs. In areas where there is a small difference between the high- and low- tide water levels, storm waves often wash shellfish onto the beaches."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":" 152 15-79. The eggs of the spiny sea urchin that lives in the waters around the Aleu tian Islands and southern Alaska are excellent food. Look for the sea urchins in tidal pools. Break the shell by placing it between two stones. The eggs are bright yellow in color. 15-80. Most northern fish and fish eggs are edible. Exceptions are the meat of the arctic shark and the eggs of the sculpins. 15-81. The bivalves, such as clams and mussels, are us ually more palatable than spiral-shelled seafood, such as snails. 15-82. The sea cucumber is another edible sea animal . Inside its body are five long white muscles that taste much like clam meat. WARNING - The black mussel, a common mollusk of the far north, may be poisonous in any season. Toxins sometimes found in the mussel's tissue are as dangerous as strychnine. 15-83. In early summer, smelt spawn in the beach surf. Sometimes you can scoop them up with your hands. 15-84. You can often find herring eggs on the seaweed in midsummer. Kelp, the long ribbonlike seaweed, and other smaller seaweeds that grow among offshore rocks are also edible. SEA ICE ANIMALS 15-85. You find polar bears in practi cally all arctic coastal regions, but rarely inland. Avoid them if possible. They are the most dangero us of all bears. They are tireles s, clever hunters with good sight and an extraordinary sense of smell. If you must kill one for food, approach it cautiously. Aim for the brain; a bullet elsewhere will rarely kill one. Always cook polar bear meat before eating it. CAUTION - Do not eat polar bear liver as it contains a toxic c oncentration of vitamin A. 15-86. Earless seal meat is some of the best meat av ailable. However, you need considerable skill to get close enough to an earless seal to k ill it. In spring, seals often bask on the ice beside thei r breathing holes. They raise their heads about every 30 seconds, ho wever, to look for their enemy, the polar bear. 15-87. To approach a seal, do as the Eskimos do—stay downwind from it, cautiously moving closer while it sleeps. If it moves, stop and imitate its movements by lying flat on the ice, raising your head up and down, and wriggling your body slightly. Approach the s eal with your body sideways to it and your arms close to your body so that you look as much like another seal as possibl e. The ice at the edge of the breathing hole is usually smooth and at an incline, so the least movement of the seal may cause it to slide into the water. Therefore, try to get within 22 to 45 meters (73 to 148 feet) of the se al and kill it instantly (aim for the brain). Try to reach the seal before it slip s into the water. In winter , a dead seal will usually float, but it is difficult to retrieve from the water. 15-88. Keep the seal blubber and skin from coming into contact with any scratch or broken skin you may have. You could get \"spekk-finger,\" a reaction th at causes the hands to become badly swollen. 15-89. Keep in mind that where there are seals, there ar e usually polar bears, and polar bears have stalked and killed seal hunters."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":" 153 15-90. You can find porcupines in southern subarctic regions where there are tr ees. Porcupines feed on bark; if you find tree limbs stri pped bare, you are likely to fi nd porcupines in the area. 15-91. Ptarmigans, owls, Canadian jays , grouse, and ravens ar e the only birds that re main in the arctic during the winter. They are scarce north of the tree line. Ptarmigans a nd owls are as good for food as any game bird. Ravens are too thin to be worth the effo rt it takes to catch them. Ptarmigans, which change color to blend with their su rroundings, are hard to spot. Rock ptarmi gans travel in pairs and you can easily approach them. Willow ptarmigans live among willow clum ps in bottomlands. They gather in large flocks and you can easily snare them. During the summer months , all arctic birds have a 2- to 3-week molting period during which they cannot fly and are easy to catch. Use one of the techniques described in Chapter 8 to catch them. 15-92. Skin and butcher game ( Chapter 8 ) while it is still warm. If you do not have time to skin the game, at least remove its entrails, musk glands, and genitals before storing. If time allows, cut the meat into usable pieces and freeze each separately so that you can use the pieces as needed. Leave the fat on all animals except seals. During the winter, game freezes quickly if left in the open. During the summer, you can store it in underground ice holes. PLANTS 15-93. Although tundras support a variet y of plants during the warm mont hs, all are small when compared to similar plants in warmer climates. For instance, the arctic willow and birch are shrubs rather than trees. Appendix B consists of plant foods and descriptions th at are found in arctic and subarctic regions. 15-94. There are some plants growing in arctic and subarctic regions that are poisonous if eaten (Appendix C ). Use the plants that you know are edible. When in doubt, follow the Universal Edibility Test in Chapter 9, Figure 9-5 . TRAVEL 15-95. You will face many obstacles if your survival situ ation is in an arctic or subarctic region. Your location and the time of the year will determine th e types of obstacles and the inherent dangers. You should— • Avoid traveling during a blizzard. • Take care when crossing thin ice. Distribu te your weight by lyi ng flat and crawling. • Cross streams when the water level is lowest . Normal freezing and thawing action may cause a stream level to vary as much as 2 to 2.5 meters (7 to 8 feet) per day. This variance may occur any time during the day, depending on the distance from a glacier, the temperature, and the terrain. Consider this variation in water level wh en selecting a campsite near a stream. • Consider the clear arctic air. It makes estim ating distance difficult. You more frequently underestimate than overestimate distances. • Avoid travel in \"whiteout\" condi tions. The lack of contrasting co lors makes it impossible to judge the nature of the terrain. • Always cross a snow bridge at right angles to the obstacl e it crosses. Find the strongest part of the bridge by poking ahead of you with a pole or i ce axe. Distribute your weight by crawling or by wearing snowshoes or skis. • Make camp early so that you have plenty of time to build a shelter."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":" 154 • Consider frozen or unfrozen rivers as avenues of travel. However, some rivers that appear frozen may have soft, open areas that make travel ve ry difficult or may not allow walking, skiing, or sledding. • Use snowshoes if you are traveling over snow-cover ed terrain. Snow 30 or more centimeters (12 inches or more) deep makes traveling difficult. If you do not have snowshoes, make a pair using willow, strips of cloth, leather, or other suitable material. 15-96. It is almost impossible to trav el in deep snow without snowshoes or skis. Traveling by foot leaves a well-marked trail for any pursuer s to follow. If you must travel in deep snow, avoid snow-covered streams. The snow, which acts as an insulator, may ha ve prevented ice from forming over the water. In hilly terrain, avoid areas where avalanches appear po ssible. Travel in the early morning in areas where there is danger of avalanches. On ridges, snow gathers on the lee side in overhanging piles called cornices. These often extend far out from th e ridge and may break loose if stepped on. WEATHER SIGNS 15-97. In most situations you can dete rmine the effects that weather ca n have on basic survival needs. Several good indicators of clima tic changes include the following: WIND 15-98. You can determine wind direction by dropping gra ss or a few leaves or by watching the treetops. Once you determine the wind direction, you can predict the type of weather th at is imminent. Rapidly shifting winds indicate an unsettled atmosphere and a likely change in the weather. CLOUDS 15-99. Clouds come in a variety of shapes and patterns. A general knowledge of clouds and the atmospheric conditions they indicate can help you predict the weather. Appendix H explains cloud formations in more detail. SMOKE 15-100. Smoke rising in a thin vertical column indicates fair weather. Low rising or \"flattened out\" smoke indicates stormy weather. BIRDS AND INSECTS 15-101. Birds and insects fly lower to the ground than nor mal in heavy, moisture-laden air. Such flight indicates that rain is likely. Most insect activity increases before a storm, but bee activity increases before fair weather. LOW-PRESSURE FRONT 15-102. Slow-moving or imperceptible winds and heavy, humid air often indicate a low-pressure front. Such a front promises bad weather that will probably linger for several days. You can \"smell\" and \"hear\" this front. The sluggish, humid ai r makes wilderness odors more pronounced than during high-pressure conditions. In addition, sounds are shar per and carry farther in low-pressu re conditions than high-pressure conditions."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":" 155 Chapter 16 Sea Survival Sea survival is perhaps the most difficult survival situation. Short- or long-term survival depends upon rations, equipment available, and your ingenu ity. You must be resourceful to survive. Water covers about 75 percent of the earth's surface, with about 70 percent be ing oceans and seas. You can assume that you will sometime cross vast expanses of water. There is always the chance that the plane or ship you are on will become crippled by such hazards as storms, collision, fire, or war. THE OPEN SEA 16-1. As a survivor on the open sea, you will face waves and wind. You may also face extreme heat or cold. To keep these environmental hazards from b ecoming serious problems, take precautionary measures as soon as possible. Use the available resources to pr otect yourself from the elements and from heat or extreme cold and humidity. 16-2. Protecting yourself from the elements meets only one of your basic needs. You must also be able to obtain water and food. Satisfying these basic needs w ill help prevent serious physical and psychological problems. However, you must also know how to treat health probl ems that may arise. PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES 16-3. Your survival at sea depends upon your— • Knowledge of and ability to use th e available survival equipment. • Special skills and ability to cope with the hazards you face. • Will to live. 16-4. When you board a ship or aircraft, find out what survival equipment is on board, where it is stowed, and what it contains. For instance, how many life pres ervers and lifeboats or rafts are on board? Where are they located? What type of survival equipment do they have? How much food, water, and medicine do they contain? How many people can be supported? Also, if you are responsible for other personnel on board, make sure you know where they are and they know where you are. DOWN AT SEA 16-5. If your aircraft goes down at se a, take the following actions. Whet her you are in the water or in a raft, you should— • Get clear and upwind of the aircraft as soon as possible, but stay in the vicinity until the aircraft sinks. • Get clear of fuel-covered water in case the fuel ignites. • Try to find other survivors. 16-6. A search for survivors usually takes place around the entire area of and n ear the crash site. Missing personnel may be unconscious and floating low in the water. Figure 16-1 , illustrates three rescue procedures."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":" 156 Figure 16-1. Rescue From Water 16-7. The best technique for rescuing personnel from the water is to throw them a life preserver attached to a line (A). Another is to send a swimmer (rescuer) from the raft with a line attached to a flotation device that will support the rescuer's we ight (B). This device will help conserve a rescuer's energy while recovering the survivor. The least ac ceptable technique is to send an at tached swimmer without flotation devices to retrieve a survi vor (C). In all cases, the rescuer wear s a life preserver. A rescuer should not underestimate the strength of a panic-stricken person in the water. A careful approach can prevent injury to the rescuer. 16-8. When the rescuer approaches a survivor in troubl e from behind, there is li ttle danger the survivor will kick, scratch, or grab him. The rescuer swims to a point directly behind the survivor and grasps the life preserver's backstrap. The rescuer uses the sidestroke to drag the survivor to the raft. 16-9. If you are in the water, make your way to a raft. If no rafts are available, try to find a large piece of floating debris to cling to. Relax; a person who knows how to relax in ocea n water is in very little danger of drowning. The body's natural buoyanc y will keep at least the top of the head above water, but some movement is needed to keep the face above water. 16-10. Floating on your back takes the least energy. Lie on your back in the water, spread your arms and legs, and arch your back. By controlling your breathi ng in and out, your face will always be out of the"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":" 157 water and you may even sleep in this position for shor t periods. Your head will be partially submerged, but your face will be above water. If you cannot float on your back or if the sea is too rough, float facedown in the water as shown in Figure 16-2 . Figure 16-2. Floating Position 16-11. The following are the best swimming st rokes during a survival situation: • Dog paddle. This stroke is excellent when clothed or wearing a life jacket. Although slow in speed, it requires very little energy. • Breaststroke. Use this stroke to swim underwater, thr ough oil or debris, or in rough seas. It is probably the best stroke for long-range swimming: it allows you to conserve your energy and maintain a reasonable speed. • Sidestroke. It is a good relief stroke because you us e only one arm to maintain momentum and buoyancy. • Backstroke. This stroke is also an excellent relief st roke. It relieves the muscles that you use for other strokes. Use it if an underwater explosion is likely. 16-12. If you are in an area where surface oil is burning— • Discard your shoes and buoya nt life preserver. NOTE: If you have an uninflated life preserver, keep it. • Cover your nose, mouth, and eyes and quickly go underwater. • Swim underwater as far as possibl e before surfacing to breathe. • Before surfacing to breathe and while still underw ater, use your hands to push burning fluid away from the area where you wish to surface. Once an area is clear of burning liquid, you can surface and take a few breaths. Try to face downwind before inhaling. • Submerge feet first and continue as above until clear of the flames. 16-13. If you are in oil-covered water that is free of fire, hold your head high to keep the oil out of your eyes. Attach your life pres erver to your wrist and then use it as a raft."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":" 158 16-14. If you have a life preserver, y ou can stay afloat for an indefinite period. In this case, use the \"Heat Escaping Lessening Posture (HELP)\" body position ( Figure 16-3 ). Remain still and assume the fetal position to help you retain body heat. You lose ab out 50 percent of your body heat through your head. Therefore, keep your head out of th e water. Other areas of high heat loss are the neck, th e sides, and the groin. Figure 16-3. HELP Position 16-15. If you are in a raft (also see Raft Procedures)— • Check the physical condition of all on board. Give first aid if necessary. Ta ke seasickness pills if available. The best way to take these pills is to place them under the tongue and let them dissolve. There are also suppositories or injections agains t seasickness. Vomiting, whether from seasickness or other causes, increases the danger of dehydration. • Try to salvage all floating equipment—rations; canteens, thermos jugs, and other containers; clothing; seat cushions; parachut es; and anything else that will be useful to you. Secure the salvaged items in or to your raft. Make sure the items have no sharp edges that can puncture the raft. • If there are other rafts, lash the rafts together so they are about 7.5 meters (25 feet) apart. Be ready to draw them closer together if you see or hear an aircraft. It is easier for an aircrew to spot rafts that are close together rather than scattered. • Remember, rescue at sea is a cooperative effort. Use all available visual or electronic signaling devices to signal and make contact with rescuers. For example, raise a flag or reflecting material on an oar as high as possi ble to attract attention. • Locate the emergency radio and get it into oper ation. Operating instruct ions are on it. Use the emergency transceiver only when friendly aircraft are likely to be in the area. • Have other signaling devices ready for instant us e. If you are in enemy territory, avoid using a signaling device that will alert th e enemy. However, if your situat ion is desperate, you may have to signal the enemy for resc ue if you are to survive. • Check the raft for inflation, leaks, and points of possible chafing. Make sure the main buoyancy chambers are firm (well r ounded) but not overly tight (Figure 16-4 ). Check inflation regularly. Air expands with heat; therefore, on hot days, releas e some air and add air when the weather cools. • Decontaminate the raft of all fuel. Petroleum will weaken its surfaces and break down its glued joints."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":" 159 • Throw out the sea anchor, or improvise a drag from the raft's case, a bailing bucket, or a roll of clothing. A sea anchor helps you stay close to your ditching site, making it easier for searchers to find you if you have relayed your location. Without a sea anchor, your raft may drift over 160 kilometers (96 miles) in a day, making it much ha rder to find you. You can adjust the sea anchor to act as a drag to slow down th e rate of travel with the current, or as a means to travel with the current. You make this adjustment by opening or closing the sea anchor's apex. When open, the sea anchor ( Figure 16-5 ) acts as a drag that keeps you in the general area. When closed, it forms a pocket for the current to strike and prope ls the raft in the current's direction. Figure 16-4. Inflating the Raft Figure 16-5. Sea Anchor 16-16. Also adjust the sea anchor so that when the raft is on the wave's crest, the sea an chor is in the wave's trough ( Figure 16-6 ). Figure 16-6. Deployment of the Sea Anchor"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":" 160 • Wrap the sea anchor rope with cloth to prevent its chafing the raft. The anchor also helps to keep the raft headed into the wind and waves. • In stormy water, rig the spray a nd windshield at once. In a 25-man raft, keep the canopy erected at all times. Keep your raft as dry as possible. K eep it properly balanced. All personnel should stay seated, the heaviest one in the center. • Calmly consider all aspects of your situation and determine wh at you and your companions must do to survive. Inventory all equipment, food, a nd water. Waterproof items that salt water may affect. These include compasses, watches, sextan t, matches, and lighters. Ration food and water. • Assign a duty position to each person or assign teams, for example, water collectors, food collectors, lookouts, radio operators , signalers, and water bailers. NOTE: Lookout duty should not exceed 2 hours. Keep in mind and remind others that cooperation is one of the keys to survival. • Keep a log. Record the navigator's last fix, the time of ditching, the names and physical condition of personnel, and the ration schedule. Also record the winds, weather, direction of swells, times of sunrise and sunset, and other navigational data. • If you are down in unfriendly waters, take specia l security measures to avoid detection. Do not travel in the daytime. Throw out the sea anchor and wait for nightfall before paddling or hoisting sail. Keep low in the raft; stay covered with the blue side of the camouflage cloth up. Be sure a passing ship or aircraft is friendly or neutral before trying to attract its attention. If the enemy detects you and you are close to capture, destroy the logbook, radio, navigation equipment, maps, signaling equipment, and firearms. Jump overboard and submerge if the enemy starts strafing. • Decide whether to stay in position or to tr avel. Ask yourself, \"How much information was signaled before the accident? Is your position know n to rescuers? Do you know it yourself? Is the weather favorable for a search? Are other ships or aircraft likely to pass your present position? How many days supply of food and water do you have?\" COLD WEATHER CONSIDERATIONS 16-17. If you are in a cold climate— • Put on an antiexposure suit. If unavailable, put on any extra clothing available. Keep clothes loose and comfortable. • Take care not to snag the raft with shoes or sharp objects. Keep the re pair kit where you can readily reach it. • Rig a windbreak, spray shield, and canopy. • Try to keep the floor of the raft dry. C over it with canvas or cloth for insulation. • Huddle with others to keep wa rm, moving enough to keep the bl ood circulating. Spread an extra tarpaulin, sail, or pa rachute over the group. • Give extra rations, if available, to men suffering from exposure to cold. 16-18. The greatest threat you face wh en submerged in cold water is death due to hypothermia. The average ocean temperature around th e world is only 11 degrees C (51 degrees F). However, do not be fooled by warm water—hypothermia can even occur in 27-degree C (80-degree F) water. When you are immersed in cold water, hypothermia occurs rapidl y due to the decreased in sulating quality of wet clothing and the result of water disp lacing the layer of stil l air that normally surrounds the body. The rate of heat exchange in water is a bout 25 times greater than it is in air of the same temperature. Figure 16-7 lists life expectancy times for immersion in water."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":" 161 Figure 16-7. Life Expectancy Times for Immersion in Water 16-19. Your best protection against the effects of cold water is to get into the life raft, stay dry, and insulate your body from the cold su rface of the bottom of the raft. If these actions are not possible, wearing an antiexposure suit will ex tend your life expectancy consider ably. Remember, keep your head and neck out of the water and well insulated from the cold water's effects when the temperature is below 19 degrees C (66 degrees F). Wear ing life preservers increases th e predicted survival time as body position in the water increases the chance of survival. HOT WEATHER CONSIDERATIONS 16-20. If you are in a hot climate— • Rig a sunshade or canopy. Leave enough space for ventilation. • Cover your skin, where possible, to protect it from sunburn. Use sunburn cream, if available, on all exposed skin. Your eyelids, the back of your ears, and the sk in under your chin sunburn easily. RAFT PROCEDURES 16-21. Most of the rafts in the U.S. Army and Air Force inventories can satisfy the needs for personal protection, mode of travel, and evasion and camouflage. NOTE: Before boarding any raft, remove and tether (att ach) your life preserver to yourself or the raft. Ensure there are no other metallic or sharp objects on your clothing or equipment that could damage the raft. After boarding the raft, don your life preserver again. 16-22. For all rafts, remember the five As. These ar e the first things you shoul d do if you are the first person into the raft: • Air-Check that all chambers are in flated and that all inflation valves are closed and equalization tube clamps (found on the 25-, 35-, and 46-man ra fts) are clamped off when fully inflated. • Assistance-Assist others into the raft. Remove all puncture-producing ite ms from pockets and move flotation devices to the rear of the body. Use proper boarding techniques; for example, the boarding loop on the seven-man raft and the boa rding ramps on the 25-, 35-, and 46-man rafts. • Anchor-Ensure the sea anchor is properly deployed. It can be found 180 degrees away from the equalization tube on the 25-, 35-, and 46-man rafts. • Accessory bag-Locate the accessory bag. It will be te thered to the raft between the smooth side of the CO 2 bottle and the closest boarding ramp. • Assessment-Assess the situation and keep a positive mental attitude."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":" 162 One-Man Raft 16-23. The one-man raft has a main cell inflation. If the CO 2 bottle should malfunctio n or if the raft develops a leak, you can inflate it by mouth. 16-24. The spray shield acts as a shelter from the col d, wind, and water. In some cases, this shield serves as insulation. The raft's insulated bottom limits the conduction of cold thereby protecting you from hypothermia (Figure 16-8 ). Figure 16-8. One-Man Raft With Spray Shield 16-25. You can travel more effectively by inflating or de flating the raft to take advantage of the wind or current. You can use the spray shield as a sail while th e ballast buckets serve to increase drag in the water. You may use the sea anchor to contro l the raft's speed and direction. 16-26. There are rafts developed for use in tactical areas that are black. These rafts blend with the sea's background. You can further modify these rafts for evas ion by partially deflati ng them to obtain a lower profile. 16-27. A lanyard connects the one-man raft to a parach utist (survivor) landing in the water. You (the survivor) inflate it upon landing. You do not swim to the raft, but pull it to you via the lanyard. The raft may hit the water upside down, but you can right it by approaching the side to whic h the bottle is attached and flipping the raft over. The spray shield must be in the raft to expose the boarding handles. Follow the five As outlined under raft procedur es above when boarding the raft ( Figure 16-9 ). Figure 16-9. Boarding the One-Man Raft"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":" 163 16-28. If you have an arm injury, the best way to board is by turning your back to the small end of the raft, pushing the raft under your buttocks, and lying back. Another way to board the raft is to push down on its small end until one knee is inside and lie forward (Figure 16-10 ). Figure 16-10. Other Methods of Boarding the One-Man Raft 16-29. In rough seas, it may be easier for you to grasp th e small end of the raft and, in a prone position, to kick and pull yourself into the raft. When you are lyi ng face down in the raft, deploy and adjust the sea anchor. To sit upright, you may have to disconnect one side of the seat kit and roll to that side. Then you adjust the spray shield. There are tw o variations of the one-man raft; the improved model incorporates an inflatable spray shield and floor that provide additional insulation. The spray shield helps keep you dry and warm in cold oceans and protects you from the sun in the hot climates ( Figure 16-11 ). Figure 16-11. One-Man Raft With Spray Shield Inflated Seven-Man Raft 16-30. Some multiplace aircraft carry the seven-man raft. It is a component of the survival drop kit (Figure 16-12 ).

If you don't have help, again work from the bottle side with the wind at your back to help hold down the raft. Follow the five As outlined in paragraph 16-22 . Then grasp an oarlock and boarding handle, kick your legs to get your body prone on the water, and then kick and pull yourself into the raft. If you are weak or injured, you may partially deflate the raft to make boarding easier ( Figure 16-14 )."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":" 165 Figure 16-14. Method of Boarding Seven-Man Raft 16-32. Use the hand pump to keep the buoyancy chambers and cross seat firm. Never overinflate the raft. 25-, 35-, and 46-Man Rafts 16-33. You may find 25-, 35-, or 46-man rafts in multiplace aircraft ( Figure 16-15 ). The 20-man raft has been discontinued. The rafts are stowed in raft compar tments on the outside of the fuselage, usually on the wings, alongside the upper half of the port (left) si de of the aircraft. There will always be enough raft space to accommodate all personnel on each type of aircraft. If the number of personnel exceeds the maximum number of raft spaces, additional rafts will be centerline-loaded and ratchet-strapped to the cargo bay floor. Some may be automatically deployed from the cockpit or from stations within the cargo area, usually near the crew chief's station, while ot hers may need manual deployment. No matter how the raft lands in the water, it is r eady for boarding. A lanyard connects th e accessory kit to the raft and you retrieve the kit by hand. You must manually inflate the center chamber with the hand pump. Board the 25- , 35-, or 46-man raft from the aircraft, if po ssible. If not, board in the following manner: • Approach the lower boarding ramp, following the arrows printed on the outside of the raft. • Remove your life preserver and tether it to yourself so that it trails behind you. • Grasp the boarding handles and kick your legs to get your body into a prone position on the water's surface; then kick and pull until you are inside the raft. Figure 16-15. 25-Man Raft"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":" 166 16-34. An incompletely inflated raft will make boardi ng easier. Approach the intersection of the raft and ramp, grasp the upper boarding handle, and swing one le g onto the center of the ramp, as in mounting a horse. 16-35. Immediately tighten the equalizer clamp upon entering the raft to pr event deflating the entire raft in case of a puncture (Figure 16-16 ). Figure 16-16. Immediate Action—Multiplace Raft 16-36. Use the pump to keep these rafts' chambers a nd center ring firm. They should be well rounded but not overly tight. The center rings keep the center of the floor afloat, and give raft occupants something to brace their feet against to prevent all o ccupants from sliding toward the center. SAILING RAFTS 16-37. Rafts do not have keels, therefore, you can't sa il them into the wind. Ho wever, anyone can sail a raft downwind. You can successfully sail the seven-ma n raft 10 degrees off from the direction of the wind. Do not try to sail the raft unless land is near. If you decide to sail and the wind is blowing toward a desired destination, fully inflate the raft, sit high, take in the sea anchor, rig a sail, and use an oar as a rudder. 16-38. In the seven-man raft, erect a square sail in the bow using the oars and their extensions as the mast and crossbar ( Figure 16-17 ). You may use a waterproof tarpaulin or parachute material for the sail. If the raft has no regular mast socket and step, erect the mast by tying it secure ly to the front cross seat using braces. Pad the bottom of the mast to prevent it from chafing or punching a hole through the floor, whether or not there is a socket. The heel of a shoe, with the toe wedged under the seat, makes a good improvised mast step. Do not secure the corners of the lower edge of the sail. Hold the lines attached to the corners with your hands so that a gust of wind will not rip the sail, br eak the mast, or capsize the raft."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":" 167 Figure 16-17. Sail Construction 16-39. Take every precaution to prevent the raft from turning over. In ro ugh weather, keep the sea anchor away from the bow. Have the passen gers sit low in the raft, with th eir weight distri buted to hold the upwind side down. To prevent falling out, they should also avoid sitting on th e sides of the raft or standing up. Avoid sudden movements without warning the other passenge rs. When the sea anchor is not in use, tie it to the raft and stow it in such a ma nner that it will hold immediat ely if the raft capsizes. WATER 16-40. Water is your most important need. With it al one, you can live for ten days or longer, depending on your will to live. When drinking water, moisten your lips, tongue, and thro at before swallowing. Short-Water Rations 16-41. When you have a limited water supply and you can't replace it by chemical or mechanical means, use the water efficiently. Protect freshwater supp lies from seawater contamination. Keep your body well shaded, both from overhead sun and from reflection off the sea surface. Allow ventilation of air; dampen your clothes during the hottest part of the day. Do not exert yourself. Relax and sleep when possible. Fix your daily water ration after consider ing the amount of water you have , the output of solar stills and desalting kit, and the number and physical condition of your party. 16-42. If you don't have water, don't eat. If your water rati on is two liters or more per day, eat any part of your ration or any additional food that you may catch, su ch as birds, fish, shrimp. The life raft's motion and your anxiety may cause nausea. If you eat when nauseated, you may lose your food immediately. If nauseated, rest and relax as much as you can, and take only water."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":" 168 16-43. To reduce your loss of water through perspiration, soak your clothes in the sea and wring them out before putting them on again. Don't overdo this dur ing hot days when no canopy or sun shield is available. This is a trade-off between cooling and the saltwater boils, sores, and rashes that will result. Be careful not to get the bottom of the raft wet. 16-44. Watch the clouds and be ready for any chance of showers. Keep the tarpaulin handy for catching water. If it is encrusted with dr ied salt, wash it in seaw ater. Normally, a small amount of seawater mixed with rain will hardly be noticeable and will not cause any physical reaction. In rough seas you cannot get uncontaminated fresh water. 16-45. At night, secure the tarpaulin like a sunshade, a nd turn up its edges to collect dew. It is also possible to collect dew along the sides of the raft using a sponge or clot h. When it rains, drink as much as you can hold. Manual Reverse Osmosis Desalinator 16-46. Most rafts today are equipped with a manual reverse osmosis desalinat or (MROD). The MROD is a very highly efficient water puri fier designed to remove salt partic les from seawater, thereby making seawater potable. The two most common models are the Survivor 35 and the Su rvivor 06, which make 35 and 6 gallons of potable water in a 24-hour period if used continuousl y. Water procurement at sea is a 24- hour-a-day job. The MROD's life cycle is up to 50,000 gallons of water. The MROD has a 10-year shelf life before it must be repacked by the manufacturer. To operate the MROD, place both the intake (larger dual hose) and the potable water supply hose into the water. Begin a 2-second cycle of pumping the handle—one second up, one second down. A pressure indicator will protrude from the pump housing to show that the proper flow is being maintained. An orange band will be visible when the correct rhythm is maintained. Purge the antimicrobial packing agent from the filter medium for 2 minutes. Then begin to collect potable water. NOTE: Ensure that the water is free from any petroleum residue (jet fuel, hydraulic fluid, or oil) before using an MROD. The filter medium is very sensitive to petroleum, oils, and lubricants, and will render the filter useless, destroying your water production capability. Solar Still 16-47. When solar stills are available, read the inst ructions and set them up immediately. Use as many stills as possible, depending on the nu mber of men in the raft and the am ount of sunlight available. Secure solar stills to the raft with care. So lar stills only work on flat, calm seas. Desalting Kits 16-48. When desalting kits are available in addition to solar stills, use them only for immediate water needs or during long overcast periods when you cannot us e solar stills. In any ev ent, keep desalting kits and emergency water stores for periods when you cannot use solar stills or catch rainwater. Water From Fish 16-49. Drink the aqueous fluid found along the spine and in the eyes of large fish. Carefully cut the fish in half to get the fluid along the spine and suck the eye. If you are so s hort of water that you need to do this,"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":" 169 then do not drink any of the other body fluids. These other fluids are rich in protein and fat and will use up more of your reserve water in digestion than they supply. Sea Ice 16-50. In arctic waters, use old sea ice for water. This ice is bluis h, has rounded corners, and splinters easily. It is nearly free of salt. New ice is gray, m ilky, hard, and salty. Water from icebergs is fresh, but icebergs are dangerous to approach. Use them as a source of water only in emergencies. 16-51. As in any survival situation there are da ngers when you are substituting or compromising necessities. Even though water is one of your basic needs, keep in mind the following tips. DO NOT— • Drink seawater. • Drink urine. • Drink alcohol. • Smoke. • Eat, unless water is available. 16-52. Sleep and rest are the best wa ys of enduring periods of reduced water and food intake. However, make sure that you have enough shade when napping duri ng the day. If the sea is rough, tie yourself to the raft, close any cover, and ride out the storm as best you can. Relax is the key word—at least try to relax. FOOD PROCUREMENT 16-53. In the open sea, fish will be the main food source. There are some poisonous and dangerous ocean fish, but, in general, when out of si ght of land, fish are safe to eat. Near er the shore there are fish that are both dangerous and poisonous to eat. There are some fish, such as the red snapper and barracuda, that are normally edible but poisonous when taken from the waters of atolls and reefs. Flying fish will even jump into your raft! Fish 16-54. When fishing, do not handle the fishing line w ith bare hands and never wrap it around your hands or tie it to a life raft. The salt that adheres to it can make it a sharp cutti ng edge, an edge dangerous both to the raft and your hands. Wear gloves, if they are available, or use a cloth to handle fish and to avoid injury from sharp fins and gill covers. 16-55. In warm regions, gut and bleed fish immediately after catching them. Cut fish that you do not eat immediately into thin, narrow strips and hang them to dry. A well-dried fish stays edible for several days. Fish not cleaned and dried may spoil in half a day. Fish with dark meat are very prone to decomposition. If you do not eat them all immediately, do not eat a ny of the leftovers. Use the leftovers for bait. 16-56. Never eat fish that have pale, shiny gills, sunken eyes, flabby sk in and flesh, or an unpleasant odor. Good fish show the opposite characteri stics. Sea fish have a saltwater or clean fishy odor. Do not confuse eels with sea snakes that have an obviously scaly body and strongly compressed, paddle-shaped tail. Both eels and sea snakes are edible, but you must handle the latter with car e because of their poisonous bites. The heart, blood, intestinal wall, and liver of most fish are edible. Cook the intestines. Also edible are the"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":" 170 partly digested smaller fish that you may find in th e stomachs of large fish. In addition, sea turtles are edible. 16-57. Shark meat is a good source of food whether raw, dried, or cooked. Shark meat spoils very rapidly due to the high concentration of urea in the blood; th erefore, bleed it immediat ely and soak it in several changes of water. People prefer some shark species over others. Consider them all edible except the Greenland shark, whose flesh contains high quantities of vitamin A. Do not eat the livers, due to high vitamin A content. Fishing Aids 16-58. The accessory kit contains a very good fishing k it that should meet your needs just about anywhere around the world. You can also use diffe rent materials to make fishing ai ds as described in the following paragraphs: • Fishing line. Use pieces of tarpaulin or canvas. Unravel the threads and tie them together in short lengths in groups of three or more threads. S hoelaces and parachute suspension line also work well. • Fish hooks. No one at sea should be wit hout fishing equipment, but if you are, improvise hooks as shown in Chapter 8 . • Fish lures. You can fashion lures by attaching a double hook to any shiny piece of metal. • Grapple. Use grapples to hook seaweed. You may shake crabs, shrimp, or small fish out of the seaweed. These you may eat or use for bait. You may eat seaweed itself, but only when you have plenty of drinking water. Improvise grapples from wood. Use a heavy piece of wood as the main shaft, and lash three smaller pieces to the shaft as grapples. • Bait. You can use small fish as bait for larger ones. Scoop the small fish up with a net. If you don't have a net, make one from cloth of some t ype. Hold the net under the water and scoop upward. Use all the guts from birds and fish for bait. When using bait, try to keep it moving in the water to give it the appearance of being alive. Helpful Fishing Hints 16-59. Your fishing should be successful if you remember the following important hints: • Be extremely careful with fish that have teeth and spines. • Cut a large fish loose rather than risk capsizing the raft. Try to catch small rather than large fish. • Do not puncture your raft with hooks or other sharp instruments. • Do not fish when large sharks are in the area. • Watch for schools of fish; try to move close to these schools. • Fish at night using a light. The light attracts fish. • In the daytime, shade attracts some fish. You may find them under your raft. • Improvise a spear by tying a knife to an oar blade. This spear can help you catch larger fish, but you must get them into the raft quickly or they will slip off the blade. Also, tie the knife very securely or you may lose it. • Always take care of your fishing equipment. Dr y your fishing lines, clean and sharpen the hooks, and do not allow the hooks to stick into the fishing lines."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":" 171 Birds 16-60. As stated in Chapter 8 , all sea birds are edible . Eat any birds you can catch. Sometimes birds may land on your raft, but usually they are cautious. You may be able to attract some birds by towing a bright piece of metal behind the raft. This will bring the bird within shooting range, provided you have a firearm. 16-61. If a bird lands within your reach, you may be ab le to catch it. If the birds do not land close enough or land on the other end of the raft, you may be able to catch them with a bird noose. Bait the center of the noose and wait for the bird to land. When the bird's f eet are in the center of the noose, pull it tight. 16-62. Use all parts of the bird. Use th e feathers for insulation, the entrails and feet for bait, and so on. Use your imagination. MEDICAL PROBLEMS ASSOCIAT ED WITH SEA SURVIVAL 16-63. At sea, you may become seasick, get saltwater so res, or face some of the same medical problems that occur on land, such as dehydration, hypothermia, or sunburn. These problems can become critical if left untreated. Seasickness 16-64. Seasickness is the nausea and vomiting caused by the motion of the raft. It can result in— • Extreme fluid loss and exhaustion. • Loss of the will to survive. • Others becoming seasick. • Attraction of sharks to the raft. • Unclean conditions. 16-65. To treat seasickness— • Wash both the patient and the raft to remove the sight and odor of vomit. • Keep the patient from eating food until his nausea is gone. • Have the patient lie down and rest. • Give the patient seasickness pills if available. If the patient is unabl e to take the pills orally, insert them rectally for absorption by the body. Do not ta ke seasickness pills if you are already seasick. They tend to make the patient even sicker; alwa ys take seasickness pills before the symptoms appear. NOTE: Some people at sea have said that erecting a canopy or using the horiz on or a cloud as a focal point helped overcome seasickness. Others have said that swimming al ongside the raft for short periods helped, but extreme care must be taken if swimming. Saltwater Sores 16-66. These sores result from a break in skin exposed to saltwater for an extended period. They may also occur at the areas that your clot hing binds you—your waist, ankles, or wrist. The sores may form scabs and pus. Do not open or drain the sore s. Flush them with freshwater, if available, and allow to dry. Apply an antiseptic, if available."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":" 172 Immersion Rot, Frostbite, and Hypothermia 16-67. These problems are similar to those encountere d in cold weather environments. Symptoms and treatment are the same as covered in Chapter 15 . Blindness or Headache 16-68. If flame, smoke, or other contaminants get in th e eyes, flush them immediat ely with saltwater, then with freshwater, if available. Appl y ointment, if available. Bandage bot h eyes 18 to 24 hours, or longer if damage is severe. If the glare from the sky and water causes your eyes to become bloodshot and inflamed, bandage them lightly. Try to prev ent this problem by wearing sungl asses. Improvise sunglasses if necessary. Constipation 16-69. This condition is a common problem on a raft. Do not take a laxative, as this will cause further dehydration. Exercise as much as possible and drink an adequate amount of water, if available. Difficult Urination 16-70. This problem is not unusual and is due mainly to dehydration. It is best not to treat it, as it could cause further dehydration. Sunburn 16-71. Sunburn is a serious problem in sea survival. Tr y to prevent sunburn by staying in the shade and keeping your head and skin covered. Use cream or lip salve from your first-aid kit. Remember, reflection from the water also causes sunburn in places where the sun usually doesn't burn you—tender skin under the earlobes, eyebrows, nose, chin, and underarms. SHARKS 16-72. Whether you are in the water or in a boat or raft, you may s ee many types of sea life around you. Some may be more dangerous than others. Genera lly, sharks are the grea test danger to you. Other animals, such as whales, porpoises, and stingrays, may look dangerous, bu t really pose little threat in the open sea. 16-73. Of the many hundreds of shark species, only a bout 20 species are known to attack man. The most dangerous are the great white shark, the hammerh ead, the mako, and the tiger shark. Other sharks known to attack man include the gray, blue, lemon, sand, nurse , bull, and oceanic white- tip sharks. Consider any shark longer than 1 meter (3 feet) dangerous. 16-74. There are sharks in all oceans and seas of the wo rld. While many live and feed in the depths of the sea, others hunt near the surface. The sharks living near the surface are the ones you will most likely see. Their dorsal fins frequently project above the water. Sharks in the trop ical and subtropical seas are far more aggressive than those in temperate waters. 16-75. All sharks are basica lly eating machines. Their normal diet is live animals of any type, and they will strike at injured or helpless animals. Sight, smell, or sound may guide them to their prey. Sharks have"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":" 173 an acute sense of smell and the smell of blood in the water excites them. They ar e also very sensitive to any abnormal vibrations in the water. The strugg les of a wounded animal or swimmer, underwater explosions, or even a fish struggl ing on a fishline will attract a shark. 16-76. Sharks can bite from almost any position; they do not have to turn on their side to bite. The jaws of some of the larger sharks are so far forward that th ey can bite floating objects easily without twisting to the side. 16-77. Sharks may hunt alone, but most reports of attack s cite more than one shark present. The smaller sharks tend to travel in schools and attack in mass. Whenever one of the sharks finds a victim, the other sharks will quickly join it. Sharks will eat a wounded shark as qui ckly as their prey. 16-78. Sharks feed at all hours of the day and night. Mo st reported shark contacts and attacks were during daylight, and many of these have been in the late afternoon. Some of the measures that you can take to protect yourself against sharks when you are in the water are— • Stay with other swimmers. A group can maintain a 360-degree wa tch. A group can either frighten or fight off sharks be tter than one man. • Always watch for sharks. Keep all your clothing on, to incl ude your shoes. Historically, sharks have attacked the unclothed men in groups first, mainly in the feet. Clothing also protects against abrasions should the shark brush against you. • Avoid urinating. If you must, only do so in small amounts. Let it dissipate betw een discharges. If you must defecate, do so in small amounts and throw it as far away from you as possible. Do the same if you must vomit. 16-79. If a shark attack is imminent while you are in the water, splash and ye ll just enough to keep the shark at bay. Sometimes yelling underwater or sla pping the water repeatedly will scare the shark away. Conserve your strength for fighti ng in case the shark attacks. 16-80. If attacked, kick and strike th e shark. Hit the shark on the gills or eyes if possible. If you hit the shark on the nose, you may injure your hand if it glances off and hits its teeth. 16-81. When you are in a raft and see sharks— • Do not fish. If you have hooked a fish, let it go. Do not clean fish in the water. • Do not throw garbage overboard. • Do not let your arms, legs, or equipment hang in the water. • Keep quiet and do not move around. • Bury all dead as soon as possible. If there are many sharks in the area, conduc t the burial at night. 16-82. When you are in a raft and a sh ark attack is imminent, hit the shark with anything you have, except your hands. You will do more damage to your hands than the shark. If you strike with an oar, be careful not to lose or break it. DETECTING LAND 16-83. You should watch carefully for any signs of la nd. There are many indicators that land is near."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":" 174 16-84. A fixed cumulus cloud in a clear sky or in a s ky where all other clouds are moving often hovers over or slightly downwind from an island. 16-85. In the tropics, the re flection of sunlight from shallow lagoons or shelves of cora l reefs often causes a greenish tint in the sky. 16-86. In the arctic, light-colored reflections on clouds often indicate ice fields or snow-covered land. These reflections are quite different from the dark gray ones caused by open water. 16-87. Deep water is dark green or dark blue. Lighter color indicates shallow water, which may mean land is near. 16-88. At night, or in fog, mist, or rain, you may detect land by odors and sounds. The musty odor of mangrove swamps and mud flats carry a long way. You hear the roar of surf l ong before you see the surf. The continued cries of seabirds coming from one di rection indicate their roos ting place on nearby land. 16-89. There usually are more birds near land than over the open sea. The directi on from which flocks fly at dawn and to which they fly at dusk may indicate the direction of land. During the day, birds are searching for food and the direction of flight has no significance. 16-90. Mirages occur at any latitude, but they are more likely in the tr opics, especially during the middle of the day. Be careful not to mistake a mirage for nearby land. A mirage disappe ars or its appearance and elevation change when viewed from slightly different heights. 16-91. You may be able to detect land by the pattern of the waves (refracted) as they approach land (Figure 16-18 ). By traveling with the waves and parallel to the slightly turbulent area marked \"X\" on the illustration, you should reach land. Figure 16-18. Wave Patterns About an Island RAFTING OR BEACHING TECHNIQUES 16-92. Once you have found land, you must get ashore safely. To raft ashore, you can usually use the one- man raft without danger. However, going ashore in a strong surf is dangerous. Take your time. Select your landing point carefully. Try not to land when the sun is low and straight in front of you. Try to land on the lee side of an island or on a point of land jutting out into the wa ter. Keep your eyes open for gaps in the surf line, and head for them . Avoid coral reefs and rocky cliffs. There are no coral reefs near the"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":" 175 mouths of freshwater streams. Avoid rip currents or strong tid al currents that may carry you far out to sea. Either signal ashore for help or sail around and look for a sloping beach where the surf is gentle. 16-93. If you have to go through the su rf to reach shore, take down the mast. Keep your clothes and shoes on to avoid severe cuts. Adjust and inflate your life vest. Trail the sea anchor over the stem using as much line as you have. Use the oars or paddles and constantly adjust the sea anchor to keep a strain on the anchor line. These actions will keep the raft pointed toward shore and prevent the sea from throwing the stern around and capsizing you. Use the oars or paddles to help ride in on the seaward side of a large wave. 16-94. The surf may be irregular and velocity may va ry, so modify your proce dure as conditions demand. A good method of getting through the surf is to have half the men sit on one side of the raft, half on the other, facing away from each other. When a heavy sea bears down, half should row (pull) toward the sea until the crest passes; then the other half should ro w (pull) toward the shore until the next heavy sea comes along. 16-95. Against a strong wind and heavy surf, the raft must have all possible speed to pass rapidly through the oncoming crest to avoid being turned broadside or thrown end over end. If possible, avoid meeting a large wave at the moment it breaks. 16-96. If in a medium surf with no wind or offshor e wind, keep the raft from passing over a wave so rapidly that it drops suddenly after to pping the crest. If the raft turns over in the surf, try to grab hold of it and ride it in. 16-97. As the raft nears the beach, ride in on the crest of a large wave. Paddle or row hard and ride in to the beach as far as you can. Do not jump out of th e raft until it has grounded, then quickly get out and beach it. 16-98. If you have a choice, do not land at night. If you have reason to believe that people live on the shore, lay away from the beach, si gnal, and wait for the inhabitant s to come out and bring you in. 16-99. If you encounter sea ice, land only on large, stable floes. A void icebergs that may capsize and small floes or those obviously disintegrating. Use oa rs and hands to keep the raft from rubbing on the edge of the ice. Take the raft out of the water and store it well back fr om the floe's edge. You may be able to use it for shelter. Keep the ra ft inflated and ready for use. Any floe may break up without warning. SWIMMING ASHORE 16-100. If rafting ashore is not possi ble and you have to swim, wear your shoes and at least one thickness of clothing. Use the sidestroke or br eaststroke to c onserve strength. 16-101. If the surf is moderate, ride in on the back of a small wave by swimming fo rward with it. Dive to a shallow depth to end the ride just before the wave breaks. 16-102. In high surf, swim toward shore in the trough between waves. When the seaward wave approaches, face it and submerge. After it passes, work toward shore in the next trough. If caught in the undertow of a large wave, push off the bottom or swim to the surface and proceed toward shore as above."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":" 176 16-103. If you must land on a rocky shore, look for a place where the waves rush up onto the rocks. Avoid places where the waves explode with a hi gh, white spray. Swim slowly when making your approach. You will need your strength to hold on to the rocks. You should be fully clothed and wear shoes to reduce injury. 16-104. After selecting your landing point, advance behind a large wave into the breakers. Face toward shore and take a sitting position with your feet in front, 60 to 90 centimeters (2 or 3 feet) lower than your head. This position will let your feet absorb the s hock when you land or strike submerged boulders or reefs. If you do not reach shore behind the wave y ou picked, swim with your hands only. As the next wave approaches, take a sitting position with your feet forward. Repeat the procedure until you land. 16-105. Water is quieter in the lee of a heavy growth of seaweed. Take advantage of such growth. Do not swim through the seaweed; crawl over the top by grasping the vegeta tion with overhand movements. 16-106. Cross a rocky or coral reef as you would land on a rocky shore. Keep your feet close together and your knees slightly bent in a relaxed sitting pos ture to cushion the blow s against the coral. PICKUP OR RESCUE 16-107. On sighting rescue craft approaching for pickup (boat, ship, conven tional aircraft, or helicopter), quickly clear any lines (fishing line s, desalting kit lines) or other ge ar that could cause entanglement during rescue. Secure all loose items in the raft. Ta ke down canopies and sails to ensure a safer pickup. After securing all items, put on your helmet, if availabl e. Fully inflate your life preserver. Remain in the raft, unless otherwise instructed, and remove all e quipment except the preservers. If possible, you will receive help from rescue personnel lowered into the water. Remember, follow all instructions given by the rescue personnel. 16-108. If the helicopter rec overy is unassisted, do the following before pickup: • Secure all the loose equipment in the raft, accessory bag, or in pockets. • Deploy the sea anchor, stability bags, and accessory bag. • Partially deflate the raft and fill it with water. • Unsnap the survival kit containe r from the parachute harness. • Grasp the raft handhold and roll out of the raft. • Allow the recovery device or the cable to ground out on the water's surface. • Maintain the handhold until the recovery device is in your other hand. • Mount the recovery device, avoidi ng entanglement with the raft. • Signal the hoist operator for pickup by placing one arm straight out to the side with your thumb up while you hold on with the other. Vigorously spla sh the water and then raise your arm in the \"thumbs up\" signal. Once recovered, DO NOT reach for the helicopter or crewman to try to assist him. Allow the aircrew personnel to pull you into the aircraft by themselves. SEASHORES 16-109. Search planes or ships do not always spot a drifting raft or sw immer. You may have to land along the coast before being rescued. Surviving along the s eashore is different from open sea survival. Food and water are more abundant and shelter is obvi ously easier to loca te and construct."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":" 177 16-110. If you are in friendly territory and decide to trav el, it is better to move along the coast than to go inland. Do not leave the coast except to avoid obstacles (swamps and cli ffs) or unless you find a trail that you know leads to human habitation. 16-111. In time of war, remember that the enemy patrols most coastlines. These patrols may cause problems for you if you land on a hostile shore. You w ill have extremely limited travel options in this situation. Avoid all contact with other humans and make every effort to cover all tracks you leave on the shore. SPECIAL HEALTH HAZARDS 16-112. Surviving on the seashore cert ainly can provide a greater abunda nce of your basic needs, but hazards also exist. Coral, poisonous and aggressive fi sh, crocodiles, sea urchins, sea biscuits, sponges, anemones, tides, and undertow can pose special health hazards that you should be aware of and know how to handle. Coral 16-113. Coral, dead or alive, can inflict painful cuts . There are hundreds of wate r hazards that can cause deep puncture wounds, severe bleeding, and the danger of infection. Clean all co ral cuts thoroughly. Do not use iodine to disinfect any coral cuts. Some cora l polyps feed on iodine and may grow inside your flesh if you use iodine. Poisonous Fish 16-114. Many reef fish have toxic flesh. For some species, the flesh is always poisonous, for other species, only at certain times of the year. The poisons are present in all pa rts of the fish, but especially in the liver, intestines, and eggs. This is due to thei r ingesting of a poisonous b acterial that grows only on coral reefs. This bacter ia is toxic to humans. 16-115. Fish toxins are water soluble; no amount of cooking will neutralize them . They are tasteless, therefore, the standard edibility te sts are useless. Birds are least susceptible to the poisons. Therefore, do not think that because a bird can eat a fish, it is a safe species for you to eat. 16-116. The toxins will produce a numbness of the lips, tongue, toes, and tips of the fingers, severe itching, and a clear reversal of temp erature sensations. Cold items app ear hot and hot items cold. There will probably also be nausea, vomiting, loss of speech, di zziness, and a paralysis that eventually brings death. 16-117. In addition to fish with poisonous flesh, th ere are those that are dangerous to touch. Many stingrays have a poisonous barb in their tail. There are also species th at can deliver an electric shock. Some reef fish, such as stonefish and toadfish, have venomous spines that can cause very painful although seldom fatal injuries. The venom from these spines causes a burning sensation or even an agonizing pain that is out of proportion to the apparent severity of the wound. A jellyfish, while not usually fatal, can inflict a very painful sting if it touches you w ith its tentacles. See Chapter 11 and Appendix F for details on particularly dangerous fish of the sea and seashore. Aggressive Fish"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":" 178 16-118. You should also avoid some fe rocious fish. The bold and inquisi tive barracuda has attacked men wearing shiny objects. It may charge lights or shiny obj ects at night. The sea bass, which can grow to 1.7 meters (6 feet), is another fish to avoid. The mo ray eel, which has many sharp teeth and grows to 1.5 meters (5 feet), can also be aggressive if disturbed. Sea Snakes 16-119. Sea snakes are venomous and sometimes found in mid ocean. They are unlikely to bite unless provoked. Avoid them. Crocodiles 16-120. Crocodiles inhabit tropical saltwater bays and mangrove-bordered estuar ies and range up to 65 kilometers (39 miles) into the open sea. Few remain near inhabited areas. You commonly find crocodiles in the remote areas of the East In dies and Southeast Asia. Consider specimens over 1 meter (3 feet) long dangerous, especially females guarding their nests. Crocodile meat is an excellent source of food when available. Sea Urchins, Sea Biscuits, Sponges, and Anemones 16-121. These animals can cause extreme, though seldom fatal, pain. Usually found in tropical shallow water near coral formations, sea urchins resemble sm all, round porcupines. If stepped on, they slip fine needles of lime or silica into the skin, where they break off and fester. If possible, remove the spines and treat the injury for infecti on. The other animals mentione d inflict injury similarly. Tides and Undertow 16-122. If caught in a large wave's undertow, push off the bottom or swim to the surface and proceed shoreward in a trough between waves. Do not fight against the pull of the unde rtow. Swim with it or perpendicular to it until it loses st rength, then swim for shore. FOOD 16-123. Obtaining food along a seashore should not present a problem. Th ere are many types of seaweed and other plants you can easily find and eat. See Chapter 9 and Appendix B for a discussion of these plants. There is also a great variety of animal life that can supply your need for food in this type of survival situation. Mollusks 16-124. Mussels, limpets, clams, sea snails, octopuses, squids, and sea slugs are all edible. Shellfish will usually supply most of the protein eaten by coastal survivors. Avoid the blue -ringed octopus and cone shells (described in Chapter 11 and Appendix F ). Also, beware of \"red tides\" that make mollusks poisonous. Apply the edibility test on each species before eating. Worms"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":" 179 16-125. Coastal worms are generally edible, but it is bett er to use them for fish bait. Avoid bristle worms that look like fuzzy caterpillars. Also, avoid tubeworms that have shar p-edged tubes. Arrow worms, alias amphioxus, are not true worms. You find them in the sand. They are excellent either fresh or dried. Crabs, Lobsters, and Barnacles 16-126. These animals are seldom dangerous to man a nd are an excellent food source. The pincers of larger crabs or lobsters can crush a man's finger. Many species have spines on their shells, making it preferable to wear gloves when catching them. Barnacl es can cause scrapes or cuts and are difficult to detach from their anchor, but the larger species are an excellent food source. Sea Urchins 16-127. These are common and can cause painful injuries when stepped on or touched. They are also a good source of food. Handle them with gloves and remove all spines. Sea Cucumbers 16-128. This animal is an important food source in the Indo-Pacific regions. Use them whole after evisceration or remove the five musc ular strips that run the length of its body. Eat them smoked, pickled, or cooked. Chapter 17 Expedient Water Crossings In a survival situation, you may have to cross a water obstacle. It may be in the form of a river, a stream, a lake, a bog, quicksand, quagmire, or muskeg. Even in th e desert, flash floods occur, making streams an obstacle. Whatever the obstacle, you n eed to know how to cross it safely. RIVERS AND STREAMS 17-1. You can apply almost every descri ption to rivers and streams. They may be shallow or deep, slow or fast moving, narrow or wide. Before you try to cross a rive r or stream, develop a good plan. 17-2. Your first step is to look for a high place from which you can get a good view of the river or stream. From this place, you can look for a place to cross. If there is no high place, climb a tree. Good crossing locations include— • A level stretch where it breaks into several chan nels. Two or three narrow channels are usually easier to cross than a wide river. • A shallow bank or sandbar. If possible, select a point upstream from the bank or sandbar so that the current will carry you to it if you lose your footing. • A course across the river that leads downstream so that you will cross the current at about a 45- degree angle. 17-3. The following areas possess potential hazards; avoid them , if possible:"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":" 180 • Obstacles on the opposite side of the river that might hinder your travel. Try to select the spot from which travel will be the safest and easiest. • A ledge of rocks that crosses the river. This often indicates dangerous rapids or canyons. • A deep or rapid waterfall or a deep channel. Neve r try to ford a stream directly above or even close to such hazards. • Rocky places that could cause you to sustain serious injuries fr om slipping or falling. Usually, submerged rocks are very slick, making balance ex tremely difficult. An occasional rock that breaks the current, however, may help you. • An estuary of a river because it is normally wide , has strong currents, and is subject to tides. These tides can influence some rivers many kilometers fr om their mouths. Go back upstream to an easier crossing site. • Eddies, which can produce a powerful backward pull downstream of th e obstruction causing the eddy and pull you under the surface. 17-4. The depth of a fordable river or stream is no deterrent if you can keep your footing. In fact, deep water sometimes runs more slowly and is therefore safer than fast-moving shallo w water. You can always dry your clothes later, or if necessary, you can make a raft to carry your clothing and equipment across the river. 17-5. You must not try to swim or wade across a st ream or river when the water is at very low temperatures. This swim could be fatal. Try to make a raft of some type. Wade across if you can get only your feet wet. Dry them vigorously as soon as you reach the other bank. RAPIDS 17-6. If necessary, you can safely cross a deep, swift ri ver or rapids. To swim across a deep, swift river, swim with the current, never fight it. Try to keep your body horizontal to the wa ter. This will reduce the danger of being pulled under. 17-7. In fast, shallow rapids, lie on your back, fe et pointing downstream, fi nning your hands alongside your hips. This action will increase buoyancy and help you steer away from obstacles. Keep your feet up to avoid getting them bruised or caught by rocks. 17-8. In deep rapids, lie on your st omach, head downstream, angling to ward the shore whenever you can. Watch for obstacles and be careful of backwater eddi es and converging currents, as they often contain dangerous swirls. Converging currents occur where ne w watercourses enter the river or where water has been diverted around large obstacles such as small islands. 17-9. To ford a swift, treacherous st ream, apply the following steps: • Remove your pants and shirt to lessen the wate r's pull on you. Keep your footgear on to protect your feet and ankles from rocks. It will also provide you with firmer footing. • Tie your pants and other articles to the top of your rucksack or in a bundle, if you have no pack. This way, if you have to release your equipment, a ll your articles will be t ogether. It is easier to find one large pack than to find several small items. • Carry your pack well up on your shoulders and be su re you can easily remove it, if necessary. Not being able to get a pack off quickly enough can drag even the strongest swimmers under. • Find a strong pole about 7.5 centimeters (3 inches) in diameter and 2.1 to 2.4 meters (7 to 8 feet) long to help you ford the stream. Grasp the pole a nd plant it firmly on your upstream side to break"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":" 181 the current. Plant your feet firmly with each st ep, and move the pole forward a little downstream from its previous position, but still upstream from you. With your next step, place your foot below the pole. Keep the pole well slante d so that the force of the cu rrent keeps the pole against your shoulder ( Figure 17-1 ). • Cross the stream so that you will cross the downstream current at a 45-degree angle. Figure 17-1. One Man Crossing Swift Stream 17-10. Using this method, you can safely cross currents us ually too strong for one person to stand against. Do not concern yourself about your pack's weight, as the weight will help rather than hinder you in fording the stream. 17-11. If there are other people with you, cross the stream together. Ensu re that everyone has prepared their pack and clothing as outlined above. Position th e heaviest person on the downstream end of the pole and the lightest on the upstream e nd. In using this method, the upstream person breaks the current, and those below can move with relative ease in the eddy formed by the upstream person. If the upstream person gets temporarily swept off his feet, the othe rs can hold steady while he regains his footing ( Figure 17-2 ). Figure 17-2. Several Men Crossing Swift Stream 17-12. If you have three or more people and a rope available, you can use the technique shown in Figure 17-3 to cross the stream. The length of the rope must be three times the width of the stream."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":" 182 Figure 17-3. Individuals Tied Together to Cross Stream RAFTS 17-13. If you have two ponchos, you can construct a brush raft or an Australian poncho raft. With either of these rafts, you can safely float your equi pment across a slow-moving stream or river. BRUSH RAFT 17-14. The brush raft, if properly constructed, will support about 115 kilograms (253 pounds). To construct it, use ponchos, fresh green brush, two sm all saplings, and rope or vine as follows ( Figure 17-4 ): • Push the hood of each poncho to the inner side and tightly tie off the necks using the drawstrings. • Attach the ropes or vines at the corner and side grommets of each poncho. Make sure they are long enough to cross to and tie with the others attached at the oppos ite corner or side. • Spread one poncho on the ground with the inner side up. Pile fresh, green brush (no thick branches) on the poncho until the brush stack is about 45 centimeters (18 inches) high. Pull the drawstring up through the center of the brush stack. • Make an X-frame from two small saplings and place it on top of the brush stack. Tie the X-frame securely in place with the poncho drawstring. • Pile another 45 centimeters (18 inches) of brush on top of the X-frame, then compress the brush slightly. • Pull the poncho sides up around the brush and, using th e ropes or vines attach ed to the corner or side grommets, tie them diagonally from co rner to corner and from side to side."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":" 183 • Spread the second poncho, inner side up, next to the brush bundle. • Roll the brush bundle onto the second poncho so that the tied side is down. Tie the second poncho around the brush bundle in the same manner as you tied the first poncho around the brush. • Place it in the water with the tied side of the second poncho facing up. Figure 17-4. Brush Raft AUSTRALIAN PONCHO RAFT 17-15. If you do not have time to gather brush for a brush raft, you can make an Australian poncho raft. This raft, although more waterproof than the poncho brush raft, will only float about 35 kilograms (77 pounds) of equipment. To construct this raft, us e two ponchos, two rucksack s, two 1.2-meter (4-foot) poles or branches, and ropes, vines, bootlace s, or comparable material as follows ( Figure 17-5 ): • Push the hood of each poncho to the inner side and tightly tie off the necks using the drawstrings. • Spread one poncho on the ground with the inner side up. Place a nd center the two 1.2-meter (4- foot) poles on the poncho about 45 centimeters (18 inches) apart. • Place your rucksacks, packs, or other equipment between the poles. Also, place other items that you want to keep dry between the poles. Snap the poncho sides together. • Use your buddy's help to complete the raft. Hold the snapped portion of th e poncho in the air and roll it tightly down to the equi pment. Make sure you roll the full width of the poncho. • Twist the ends of the roll to form pigtails in opposite directions. Fold the pigtails over the bundle and tie them securely in place us ing ropes, bootlaces, or vines. • Spread the second poncho on the ground, inner side up. If you need more buoyancy, place some fresh green brush on this poncho. • Place the equipment bundle, tied side down, on the center of the second poncho. Wrap the second poncho around the equipment bundle following the same procedure you used for wrapping the equipment in the first poncho. • Tie ropes, bootlaces, vines, or other binding material around th e raft about 30 centimeters (12 inches) from the end of each pigtail. Place and secure weapons on top of the raft. • Tie one end of a rope to an empty canteen and th e other end to the raft. This will help you to tow the raft."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":" 184 Figure 17-5. Australian Poncho Raft PONCHO DONUT RAFT 17-16. Another type of raft is the poncho donut raft. It takes more time to construct than the brush raft or Australian poncho raft, but it is effective. To constr uct it, use one poncho, small saplings, willow or vines, and rope, bootlaces, or other binding material ( Figure 17-6 ) as follows: • Make a framework circle by placing several stakes in the ground that roughly outline an inner and outer circle. • Using young saplings, willow, or vines, construc t a donut ring within the circles of stakes. • Wrap several pieces of cordage around the donut ring about 30 to 60 centimeters (12 to 24 inches) apart and tie them securely. • Push the poncho's hood to the inner side and tightly tie off th e neck using the drawstring. • Place the poncho on the ground, inner side up. Pl ace the donut ring on the center of the poncho. Wrap the poncho up and over the donut ring and tie off each grommet on the poncho to the ring. • Tie one end of a rope to an empt y canteen and the other end to the raft. This rope will help you to tow the raft. Figure 17-6. Poncho Donut Raft 17-17. When launching any of the above rafts, take car e not to puncture or tear it by dragging it on the ground. Before you start to cross the ri ver or stream, let the raft lay on the water a few minutes to ensure that it floats. 17-18. If the river is too deep to ford, push the raft in front of you while you are swimming. The design of the above rafts does not allow them to carry a person's full body weight. Use them as a float to get you and your equipment safely ac ross the river or stream. 17-19. Be sure to check the water temperature before tr ying to cross a river or wa ter obstacle. If the water is extremely cold and you are unable to find a shallow fording place in the river, do not try to ford it. Devise other means for crossing. For instance, you might improvise a bridge by felling a tree over the"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":" 185 river. Or you might build a raft large enough to ca rry you and your equipment. For this, however, you will need an axe, a knife, a rope or vines, and time. LOG RAFT 17-20. You can make a raft using any dry, dead, sta nding trees for logs. However, spruce trees found in polar and subpolar regions make the be st rafts. A simple method for making a raft is to use pressure bars lashed securely at each end of the raft to hold the logs together ( Figure 17-7 ). Figure 17-7. Use of Pressure Bars FLOTATION DEVICES 17-21. If the water is warm enough for swimming and you do not have the time or materials to construct one of the poncho-type rafts, you can use various flotation de vices to negotiate the water obstacle. Some items you can use for flotation devices are— • Trousers. Knot each trouser leg at the bottom and close the fly. With both hands, grasp the waistband at the sides and swing the trousers in th e air to trap air in each leg. Quickly press the sides of the waistband together and hold it underwater so that th e air will not escape. You now have water wings to keep you aflo at as you cross the body of water. NOTE: Wet the trousers before inflating to trap the ai r better You may have to reinflate the trousers several times when crossing a large body of water. • Empty containers. Lash together empty gas cans, water j ugs, ammo cans, boxes, or other items that will trap or hold air. Use them as water wings. Use this type of flotation device only in a slow- moving river or stream. • Plastic bags and ponchos. Fill two or more plastic bags with ai r and secure them together at the opening. Use your poncho and roll green vegetation tightly inside it so that you have a roll at least 20 centimeters (8 inches) in diameter. Tie the ends of the roll securely. You can wear it around your waist or across one shoul der and under the opposite arm. • Logs. Use a stranded drift log if one is available, or find a log near the water to use as a float. Be sure to test the log before starting to cross. Some tree logs—palm, fo r example—will sink even when the wood is dead. Another method is to tie two logs about 60 centimeters (24 inches) apart. Sit between the logs with your back ag ainst one and your legs over the other ( Figure 17-8 ). • Cattails. Gather stalks of cattails and tie them in a bundle 25 centimeters (10 inches) or more in diameter. The many air cells in each stalk cause a st alk to float until it ro ts. Test the cattail bundle to be sure it will support your weight be fore trying to cross a body of water."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":" 186 Figure 17-8. Log Flotation 17-22. There are many other flotation devices that you can devise by using some imagination. Just make sure to test the device before trying to use it. OTHER WATER OBSTACLES 17-23. Other water obstacles that you may face are bogs , quagmire, muskeg, or quicksand. Do not try to walk across these. Trying to lift your feet while standing upright will make you sink deeper. Try to bypass these obstacles. If you are unable to bypass them, you may be able to bridge them using logs, branches, or foliage. 17-24. A way to cross a bog is to lie face down, with your arms and legs sp read. Use a flotation device or form pockets of air in your clothing. Swim or pull your way across moving slowly and trying to keep your body horizontal. 17-25. In swamps, the areas that have vegetation are usually firm enough to support your weight. However, vegetation will usually not be present in open mud or water areas. If you are an average swimmer, you should have no problem swimming, craw ling, or pulling your way through miles of bog or swamp. 17-26. Quicksand is a mixture of sand and water that fo rms a shifting mass. It yields easily to pressure and sucks down and engulfs objects resting on its surf ace. It varies in depth and is usually localized. Quicksand commonly occurs on flat s hores, in silt-choked rivers with sh ifting watercourses, and near the mouths of large rivers. If you ar e uncertain whether a sandy area is quicksand, toss a small stone on it. The stone will sink in quicksand. Although quicksand has more suction than mud or muck, you can cross it just as you would cross a bog. Lie face down, spread your arms and legs, and move slowly across. VEGETATION OBSTACLES 17-27. Some water areas you must cross may have unde rwater and floating plants that will make swimming difficult. However, you can swim through re latively dense vegetation if you remain calm and do not thrash about. Stay as near the surface as possibl e and use the breaststroke with shallow leg and arm motion. Remove the plants around you as you would cl othing. When you get tire d, float or swim on your back until you have rested enough to continue with the breaststroke. 17-28. The mangrove swamp is another type of obstacl e that occurs along tropi cal coastlines. Mangrove trees or shrubs throw out many prop roots that fo rm dense masses. To get through a mangrove swamp, wait for low tide. If you are on the inland side, look for a narrow gr ove of trees and work your way seaward through these. You can also try to find the bed of a waterway or creek through the trees and"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":" 187 follow it to the sea. If you are on the seaward side, work inland along streams or channels. Be on the lookout for crocodiles along channels and in shallow wa ter. If there are any near you, leave the water and scramble over the mangrove roots. While crossing a ma ngrove swamp, it is possible to gather food from tidal pools or tree roots. 17-29. A large swamp area requires more time and effort. Therefore, if you must cross a large swamp area, construct some type of raft. Chapter 18 Field-Expedient Direction Finding In a survival situation, you will be extremely fortuna te if you happen to have a map and compass. If you do have these two pieces of equipment, you will most lik ely be able to move to ward help. If you are not proficient in using a map and compass, you must take the steps to gain this skill. There are several methods by which you can determine direction by using the sun and the stars. These methods, however, will give you only a general direction. You can come up with a more nearly true direction if you know the terrain of the territory or country. You must learn all you can about the terrain of the country or territory to which you or your unit may be sent, especially any prominent features or landmarks. This knowledge of the terr ain together with using the methods explained below will let you come up with fairly true directions to help you navigate. USING THE SUN AND SHADOWS 18-1. The earth's relationship to the sun can help you to determine direct ion on earth. The sun always rises in the east and sets in the west, but not exactly due east or due west. There is also some seasonal variation. Shadows will move in the opposite direction of the sun. In the Northern Hemisphere, they will move from west to east, and will point north at noon. In the Southern Hemisphere, shadows will indicate south at noon. With practice, you can use sh adows to determine both direction and time of day. The shadow methods used for direction finding are the shadow-tip and watch methods. SHADOW-TIP METHODS 18-2. In the first shadow-tip method, find a straight st ick 1 meter (3 feet) long, a nd a level spot free of brush on which the stick will cast a definite shadow. Th is method is simple and accurate and consists of four steps: • Step 1. Place the stick or branch into the ground at a level spot where it will cast a distinctive shadow. Mark the shadow's tip with a stone, twig , or other means. This first shadow mark is always west— everywhere on earth. • Step 2. Wait 10 to 15 minutes until the shadow tip move s a few centimeters. Mark the shadow tip's new position in the same way as the first. This mark will represent East. • Step 3. Draw a straight line through the two marks to obtain an approxima te east-west line. • Step 4. Stand with the first mark (west) to your left and the second mark to your right—you are now facing north. This fact is true everywhere on earth."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":" 188 18-3. An alternate method is more accurate but requires more time. Set up your shadow stick and mark the first shadow in the morning. Us e a piece of string to draw a clean arc through this mark and around the stick. At midday, the shadow will shrink and disappear. In the afternoon, it will lengthen again and at the point where it touches the arc, make a second mark. Dr aw a line through the two ma rks to get an accurate east-west line ( Figure 18-1 ). Figure 18-1. Shadow-Tip Method THE WATCH METHOD 18-4. You can also determine direction using a common or analog watch—one that has hands. The direction will be accurate if you are using true local time, without any changes for daylight savings time. Remember, the further you are from the equator, the more accurate this method will be. If you only have a digital watch, draw a clock face on a circle of pape r with the correct time on it and use it to determine your direction at that time. You ma y also choose to draw a clock f ace on the ground or lay your watch on the ground for a more accurate reading. 18-5. In the Northern Hemisphere, hold the watch horiz ontal and point the hour ha nd at the sun. Bisect the angle between the hour hand and the 12-o'cl ock mark to get the north-south line ( Figure 18-2 ). If there is any doubt as to which end of the line is north, remember that the sun rises in the east, sets in the west, and is due south at noon. The sun is in the east before noon and in the west after noon."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":" 189 Figure 18-2. Watch Method NOTE: If your watch is set on dayli ght savings time, use the midway point between the hour hand and 1 o'clock to determine the north-south line. 18-6. In the Southern Hemisphere, point the watch's 12-o'clock mark toward the sun; a midpoint halfway between 12 and the hour hand will give you the north-south line ( Figure 18-2 ). 18-7. Another method is called the 24-hour clock met hod. Take the local military time and divide it by two. Imagine this result to now represent the hour ha nd. In the Northern Hemisphere, point this resulting hour hand at the sun, and the 12 will point north. For example, it is 1400 hours. Divide 1400 by two and the answer is 700, which will represent the hour. Hold ing the watch horizontal, point the 7 at the sun and 12 will point north. In the Southern Hemisphere, point the 12 at the sun, and the resulting \"hour\" from the division will point south. USING THE MOON 18-8. Because the moon has no light of its own, we can only see it when it reflec ts the sun's light. As it orbits the earth on its 28-day circuit, the shape of the reflected light va ries according to its position. We say there is a new moon or no moon when it is on the opposite side of the earth from the sun. Then, as it moves away from the earth's shadow, it begins to refl ect light from its right si de and waxes to become a full moon before waning, or losing shape, to appear as a sliver on the left side. You can use this information to identify direction. 18-9. If the moon rises before the sun has set, the illuminated side will be the west. If the moon rises after midnight, the illuminated side will be the east. This obvious discovery provides us with a rough east-west reference during the night. USING THE STARS 18-10. Your location in the Northern or Southern Hemisphere determ ines which constellation you use to determine your north or south direc tion. Each sky is explained below. THE NORTHERN SKY"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":" 190 18-11. The main constellations to le arn are the Ursa Major, also known as the Big Dipper or the Plow, and Cassiopeia, also known as the Lazy W ( Figure 18-3 ). Use them to locate Polaris, also known as the polestar or the North Star. Polaris is considered to remain stati onary, as it rotates only 1.08 degrees around the northern celestial pole. The North Star is the last star of the Little Dipper's handle and can be confused with the Big Dipper. However, the Little Di pper is made up of seven ra ther dim stars and is not easily seen unless you are far away from any town or city lights. Prevent conf usion by attempting to use both the Big Dipper and Cassiopeia together. The Big Dipper and Cassi opeia are generally opposite each other and rotate counterclockwise around Polaris, with Polaris in th e center. The Big Dipper is a seven- star constellation in the shape of a dipper. The two stars forming th e outer lip of this dipper are the \"pointer stars\" because they point to the North Star. Mentally draw a lin e from the outer bottom star to the outer top star of the Bi g Dipper's bucket. Extend this line abou t five times the distance between the pointer stars. You will find the North Star along this line. You may also note that the North Star can always be found at the same approximate vertical angl e above the horizon as the northern line of latitude you are located on. For example, if you are at 35 degrees north latitude, Polaris will be easier to find if you scan the sky at 35 degrees off the horizon. This w ill help to lessen the area of the sky in which to locate the Big Dipper, Cassi opeia, and the North Star. Figure 18-3. The Big Dipper and Cassiopeia 18-12. Cassiopeia or the Lazy W has fi ve stars that form a shape like a \"W.\" One side of the \"W\" appears flattened or \"lazy.\" The North Star can be found by bisecting the angl e formed on the lazy side. Extend this line about five times the distance between th e bottom of the \"W\" and the top. The North Star is located between Cassiopeia and th e Ursa Major (Big Dipper). 18-13. After locating the North Star, locate the North Pole or true north by drawing an imaginary line directly to the earth. THE SOUTHERN SKY 18-14. Because there is no single star bright enough to be easily recognized near the south celestial pole, you can use a constellation known as th e Southern Cross. You can use it as a signpost to the South ( Figure 18-4 ). The Southern Cross or Crux has five stars. Its f our brightest stars form a cross. The two stars that make up the Cross's long axis are used as a guideline. To determine south, imagine a distance four-and-"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":" 191 one-half to five times the distance between these stars and the horizon. The pointer st ars to the left of the Southern Cross serve two purposes. First, they provide an additional cue toward south by imagining a line from the stars toward the ground. Second, the pointer st ars help accurately identify the true Southern Cross from the False Cross. The intersection of the S outhern Cross and the two poi nter stars is very dark and devoid of stars. This area is called the coal s ac. Look down to the horizon from this imaginary point and select a landmark to steer by. In a static survival situation, you can fi x this location in daylight if you drive stakes in the ground at night to point the way. Figure 18-4. Southern Cross MAKING IMPROVISED COMPASSES 18-15. You can construct improvised compasses using a pi ece of ferrous metal that can be needleshaped or a flat double-edged razor blade and a piece of thread or long hair from which to suspend it. You can magnetize or polarize the metal by slowly stroking it in one direction on a piece of silk or carefully through your hair using deliberate strokes. You can al so polarize metal by str oking it repeatedly at one end with a magnet. Always stroke in one direction only. If you have a battery and some electric wire, you can polarize the metal electrically. The wire should be insulated. If it is not insulated, wrap the metal object in a single, thin strip of pa per or a leaf to prevent contact. The battery must be a minimum of 2 volts. Form a coil with the electric wi re and touch its ends to the battery' s terminals. Repeatedly insert one end of the metal object in and out of the coil. The needle will become an electromagnet. When suspended from a piece of nonmetallic string, or floated on a small piece of wood, cork or a leaf in water, it will align itself with a north-south line. 18-16. You can construct a more elaborate improvised compass using a sewing needle or thin metallic object, a nonmetallic container (for example, the cut-o ff bottom of a plastic contai ner or soft drink bottle), and the silver tip from a pen. To construct this compa ss, take an ordinary sewing needle and break in half. One half will form your direction poin ter and the other will act as the pi vot point. Push the portion used as the pivot point through the bottom cen ter of your container; this porti on should be flush on the bottom and not interfere with the lid. Attach the center of the other portion (the pointer) of the needle on the pen's silver tip using glue, tree sap, or melted plastic. Ma gnetize one end of the pointer and rest it on the pivot point. OTHER MEANS OF DETERMINING DIRECTION"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":" 192 18-17. The old saying about using moss on a tree to indi cate north is not considered accurate because moss grows completely around some trees. Actually, growth is more lush on the side of the tree facing the south in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa in the southern hemisphere. If there are several felled trees around for comparison, look at the stumps. Growth is more vi gorous on the side toward the equator and the tree growth rings will be more widely space d. On the other hand, the tree growth rings will be closer together on the side toward the poles. 18-18. Wind direction may be helpful in some inst ances where there are prevailing directions and you know what they are. 18-19. Recognizing the differences betw een vegetation and moisture patt erns on north- and south-facing slopes can aid in determining direct ion. In the Northern Hemisphere, north-facing slopes receive less sun than south-facing slopes and are therefore cooler and damper. In th e summer, north-facing slopes retain patches of snow. In the winter, tr ees and open areas on south-facing sl opes and the southern side of boulders and large rocks are the first to lose their snow. The ground sn owpack is also shallower due to the warming effects of the sun. In the Southern Hemisphere, all of these effects will be the opposite. Chapter 19 Signaling Techniques One of your first concerns when you find yourself in a survival situation is to communicate with your friends or allies. Generally, comm unication is the giving and receiving of information. In a survival situation, you must first get your rescuer's atte ntion, then second, send a message your rescuer understands. Some attenti on-getters are man-made geometric pattern s such as straight lines, circles, triangles, or Xs displayed in uninhab ited areas; a large fire or flash of light; a large, br ight object moving slowly; or contrast, whether from color or shad ows. The type of signal used will depend on your environment and the enemy situation. APPLICATION 19-1. If in a noncombat situation, you need to fi nd the largest available clear and flat area on the highest possible terrain. Use as obvious a signal as you can create. On the other hand, you will have to be more discreet in combat situations. You do not want to signal and attract the enemy. Pick an area that is visible from the air, but ensure there are hiding places near by. Try to have a hill or other object between the signal site and the enemy to mask your signal from the enemy. Perform a thorough reconnaissance of the area to ensure there are no enemy forces nearby. 19-2. Whatever signaling technique or device you plan to use, know how to use it and be ready to put it into operation on short notice. If po ssible, avoid using signals or signaling techniques that can physically endanger you. Keep in mind that signals to your friends may alert the enemy of your presence and location. Before signaling, carefu lly weigh your rescue chances by friends against the danger of capture by the enemy. 19-3. A radio is probably the surest and quickest wa y to let others know where you are and to let you receive their messages. Become famili ar with the radios in your unit. Learn how to operate them and how to send and receive messages."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":" 193 19-4. You will find descriptions of other signaling tec hniques, devices, and articles you can use. Learn how to use them. Think of ways in which you can ad apt or change them for different environments. Practice using these signaling techniques, device s, and articles before you need them. Planned, prearranged signaling techniques may improve your chance of rescue. MEANS FOR SIGNALING 19-5. There are two main ways to get attention or to communicate—vi sual and audio. The means you use will depend on your situation and the material you have available. Whatever the means, always have visual and audio signals ready for use. Throughout this chapter you will see references to \"groups of threes.\" This is because nature does not normally replicate anything in groups of three. \"Things in threes\" tend more often to be manmade sounds or visual signals. VISUAL SIGNALS 19-6. These signals are materials or equipment you use to make your pr esence known to rescuers. Visual signals can include fire, smoke, flares, and many ot her means of signaling. Fire 19-7. During darkness, fire is an e ffective visual means for signaling. Buil d three fires in a triangle (the international distress signal) or in a straight line with about 25 meters (83 feet) between the fires. Build them as soon as time and the situation permit and protect them from the elements until you need them. If you are alone, maintaining three fires may be difficult. If so, maintain one signal fire. The hot coal bed left by a fire also may be seen by aerial platform s that are equipped to detect infrared or thermal signatures. 19-8. When constructing signal fires, consider your geographic locati on. If in a jungle, find a natural clearing or the edge of a stream where you can build fires that the jungle foliage will not hide. You may even have to clear an area. If in a snow-covered area, you may have to clear the ground of snow or make a platform on which to build the fire so that melting snow will not extinguish it. 19-9. A burning tree (tree torch) is a nother way to attract attention ( Figure 19-1 ). You can set pitch- bearing trees afire, even when green . You can get other types of trees to burn by placing dry wood in the lower branches and igniting it so that the flames flare up and ignite the foliage. Be fore the primary tree is consumed, cut and add more small green trees to th e fire to produce more sm oke. Always select an isolated tree so that you do not start a forest fire and endanger yourself. Figure 19-1. Tree Torch"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":" 194 Smoke 19-10. During daylight, build a smoke genera tor and use smoke to gain attention ( Figure 19-2 ). The international distress signal is thre e columns of smoke. Try to create a color of smoke that contrasts with the background; dark smoke against a light background and vice versa. If you practically smother a large fire with green leaves, moss, or a little water, the fire will produce white smoke. If you add rubber or oil- soaked rags to a fire, you will get black smoke. Figure 19-2. Smoke Generator—Ground 19-11. In a desert environment, smoke hangs close to the ground, but a pilot can spot it in open desert terrain. 19-12. Smoke signals are effective only on comparativ ely calm, clear days. Hi gh winds, rain, or snow disperse smoke, lessening its chances of being seen. Smoke Grenades 19-13. If you have smoke grenades with you, use them in the same pattern as described for fires. Keep them dry so that they will work when you need them. Take care not to ignite the vegetation in the area when you use them. Red is an inte rnationally recognized color of distress, but any color smoke, if properly used, will attract attention. Pen Flares 19-14. The M185 signal device is part of an aviator's su rvival vest. The device c onsists of a pen-shaped gun with a flare attached by a nylon co rd. When fired, the pen flare sounds like a pistol shot and fires the flare about 150 meters (495 f eet) high. It is about 3 centim eters (1 inch) in diameter. 19-15. To have the pen flare ready for immediate use, take it out of its wrapper, partially screw on the flare, leave the gun uncocked, and drape the cord around your neck. Be ready to fi re it well in front of search aircraft in a nonthreatening di rection and be ready with a secondary signal. Also, be ready to take"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":" 195 cover in case the pilot mistakes the flare for enemy fire . It is important to note th at pen flares may deflect off tree limbs and tree canopies. This may cause the fl are to deflect or shoot b ack to the ground, causing a forest fire hazard. Ensure you have proper overhead cl earance and an obstacle-fr ee path to shoot through. Gyro-Jets 19-16. These devices are the newer versi on of the pen flare. They differ in that they are jet-powered rather than ballistic like the pen flares. Th ey will reach a height of up to 300 meters (990 feet). To prepare them for firing, the flares are pushed until firmly seated into a crimped collar rather than a threaded screw-on type assembly. They are designed to better penetrate tree canopies, but do not rely on this to always happen. Always ensure you have a clear path in whic h to aim and fire all overhead pyrotechnics. Again, groups of threes are internationall y recognized symbols of distress. Tracer Ammunition 19-17. You may use rifle or pistol tracer ammunition to signal search aircraft. Do not fire the ammunition in front of the aircraft. As with pe n flares, be ready to ta ke cover if the pilot mistakes your tracers for enemy fire. Again, groups of threes are internationally recognized symbols of distress. Star Clusters 19-18. Red is the international distress color; therefore, use a red star cluster whenever possible. However, any color will let your rescuers know where you are. St ar clusters reach a hei ght of 200 to 215 meters (660 to 710 feet), burn an average of 6 to 10 seconds, and descend at a rate of 14 meters (46 feet) per second. Star Parachute Flares 19-19. These flares reach a height of 200 to 215 mete rs (660 to 710 feet) and descend at a rate of 2.1 meters (7 feet) per second. Th e M126 (red) burns about 50 seconds and the M127 (white) about 25 seconds. At night you can see th ese flares at 48 to 56 kilo meters (30 to 34 miles). MK-13 and MK-124 19-20. These signals are normally found on aircraft and lift rafts. They produce an orange smoke on one end for day signaling and a flare on the other end for nighttime use. The smoke lasts for approximately 15 seconds and the flare lasts 20 to 25 seconds. Though the signal is designed for use on a life raft, they do not float. They are designed to be handheld, but hold the device by the fa r end that is not being used to prevent burns. Note that after expe nding either signal the other end is still available for use, so do not discard it until both ends have been used. There are numerous redundant markings on each side of the flare to ensure that you activate th e correct signal, day or night. The end caps are colored, raised protrusions or nipples are presen t, and a washer is on the pull ring to differentiate night and day. Mirrors or Shiny Objects 19-21. On a sunny day, a mirror is your best signali ng device. If you don't have a mirror, polish your canteen cup, your belt buckle, or a similar object that will reflect the s un's rays. Direct the flashes in one area so that they are secure from enemy observation. Practice using a mirror or shiny object for signaling now ; do not wait until you need it. If you have an MK-3 signal mirror, foll ow the instructions on its back"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":" 196 (Figure 19-3 ). An alternate, easier method of aiming the si gnal mirror is to catch the reflection on the palm of your hand or in between two fingers held up in a \"V\" or \"peace sign.\" Now slowly move your hand so that it is just belo w your aim point or until the aircraft is between the \"V\" in y our fingers, keeping the glare on your palm. Then move the mirror slowly and rhythmically up and down off your hand and onto the aim point as in Figures 19-4 and 19-5 . Figure 19-3. MK-3 Signal Mirror Figure 19-4. Aiming an Improvised Signal Mirror "},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":" 197 Figure 19-5. Aiming an Improvised Sign al Mirror Using a Stationary Object 19-22. Wear the signal mirror on a cord or chain around your neck so that it is ready for immediate use. However, be sure the glass side is against your body so that it will not flash; the enemy can see the flash. 19-23. Haze, ground fog, and mirages may make it hard for a pilot to spot signals from a flashing object. So, if possible, get to the highest point in your area when signaling. If you can't determine the aircraft's location, flash your signal in the direction of the aircraft noise. NOTE: Pilots have reported seeing mirror flashes up to 160 kilometers (96 miles) away under ideal conditions. Flashlight or Strobe Light 19-24. At night you can use a flashlight or a strobe lig ht to send an SOS to an aircraft. When using a strobe light, take care to prevent the pilot from mistaking it for incoming gr ound fire. The strobe light flashes 60 times per minute. Some strobe lights have in frared covers and lenses. Blue flash collimators are also available for strobe lights that aid in distinguishing the flashing of the strobe light from a muzzle flash, and also make the strobe light directional. Laser Devices 19-25. Laser aiming devices on weapons systems are high ly visible. So are targeting pointers and many commercial types of lase r presentation pointers. Firefly Lights 19-26. These small lights, about 3 centimeters (1 1/4 inches) square and 1 centimeter (1/8 inch) thick, snap onto 9-volt batteries. They are available in a vari ety of visible and infrare d, blinking and steady light versions. The visible range and battery duration will depend on the intensity of the bulb and the mode each light uses. Other models incorporate a 4-second programmable memory that allows users to input any particular code they wish. VS-17 Panel 19-27. During daylight you can use a VS-17 panel to signal. Place the orange side up as it is easier to see from the air than the violet side. Flashing the panel wi ll make it easier for the aircrew to spot. You can use any bright orange or violet cloth as a subs titute for the VS-17. Clothing 19-28. Spreading clothing on the ground or in the top of a tree is another way to signal. Select articles whose color will contrast with the natural surroundi ngs. Arrange them in a large geometric pattern to make them more likely to attract attention. Natural Material"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":" 198 19-29. If you lack other means, you can use natural mate rials to form a symbol or message that can be seen from the air. Build mounds that cast shadows; you can use brush, foliage of any type, rocks, or snow blocks. 19-30. In snow-covered areas, tramp the snow to form letters or symbols and fill the depression with contrasting material (twigs or bran ches). In sand, use boulders, vegetation, or seaweed to form a symbol or message. In brush-covered areas, cut out patterns in the vegetation or sear the ground. In tundra, dig trenches or turn the sod upside down. 19-31. In any terrain, use contrasting materials that will make the sy mbols visible to th e aircrews. Orient the signal in a north-south fashion to attain the maximum benefit of the sun's shadow for contrast and recognition. Sea Dye Markers 19-32. All aircraft involved in operati ons near or over water will normally carry a water survival kit that contains sea dye markers. If you are in a water surviv al situation, use sea dye markers during daylight to indicate your location. These spots of dye stay conspicuous for about 3 hours, except in very rough seas. Use them only if you are in a frie ndly area. Keep the markers wra pped until you are ready to use them. The sea dye is visible at a distance of more than 11 kilometers (7 miles) from an aircraft at 2,000 feet, so you should use them only when you hear or sight an airc raft. To further conserve them do not use them all at once. Dip the marker bag in the water until a slic k about 30 meters (100 feet) appears. Sea dye markers are also very effective on snow-covered ground; use them to write distress code letters. NOTE: Rumors have persisted about how sea dye attrac ts sharks. The U.S. Navy has conducted research, and no scientific data has been found to support this rumor. Sharks are naturally curious and are drawn to strange objects in their ar ea. Therefore, a shark may investigate a person, with or wit hout sea dye, as a possible food source. Do not be afraid to use sea dye markers; it may be your last or only chance to signal a rescue aircraft. AUDIO SIGNALS 19-33. Your other means of signaling a rescuer can be audio signals. Radios, whistles, and gunshots are some of the methods you can use to signal your location. Radio Equipment 19-34. The AN/PRC-90 survival radio is a part of th e Army aviator's survival vest. The AN/PRC-112 will eventually replace the AN/PRC-90. Both radios can transmit either tone or voice. Any other type of Army radio can do the same. The ranges of the different ra dios vary depending on the al titude of the receiving aircraft, terrain, vegetation density, weather, battery st rength, type of radio, and interference. To obtain maximum performance from radios, use the following procedures: • Try to transmit only in clear, unobstructed terrain. Since radios are line-of-sight communications devices, any terrain between the radio and the receiver will block the signal. • Keep the antenna at right angles to the rescuing aircraft. There is little or no signal strength emanating from the tip of the antenna. • If the radio has tone capability, place it upright on a flat, elevated surface so that you can perform other survival tasks."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":" 199 • Never let any part of the ante nna or its mounting lug touch yo ur clothing, body, foliage, or the ground. Such contact greatly reduc es the range of the signal. • Conserve battery power. Turn the radio off when you are not using it. Do not transmit or receive constantly. In hostile territory, k eep transmissions short to avoi d enemy radio direction finding. • In cold weather, keep the battery inside your clothing when not using the radio. Cold quickly drains the battery's power. Do not expose the battery to extreme heat such as desert sun. High heat may cause the battery to explode. The radio is designed to be waterproof, but always try to keep the radio and battery as dry as possibl e, as water may destroy the circuitry. • A worldwide satellite monitoring system has been developed by internatio nal search and rescue agencies to assist in locating survivors. To activ ate this search and rescue satellite-aided tracking (SARSAT) system in peacetime, key the transmitter for a minimum of 30 seconds. Whistles 19-35. Whistles provide an excellent way for close- up signaling. In some documented cases, they have been heard up to 1.6 kilometers (3/4 mile) away. Manufactured whistles have more range than a human whistle. Gunshots 19-36. In some situations you can use firearms for signa ling. Three shots fired at di stinct intervals usually indicate a distress signal. Do not use this technique in enemy territory. The enemy will surely come to investigate shots. CODES AND SIGNALS 19-37. Now that you know how to let people know wher e you are, you need to know how to give them more information. It is easier to fo rm one symbol than to spell out an entire message. Therefore, learn the codes and symbols that all aircraft pilots understand. SOS 19-38. You can use lights or flags to send an SOS—thr ee dots, three dashes, three dots. The SOS is the internationally recognized distress si gnal in radio Morse code. A dot is a short, sharp pulse; a dash is a longer pulse. Keep repeating the sign al. When using flags, hold flags on the left side for dashes and on the right side for dots. GROUND-TO-AIR EMERGENCY CODE 19-39. This code ( Figure 19-6 ) is actually five definite, meaningf ul symbols. Make these symbols a minimum of 4 meters (13 feet) wide and 6 meters ( 20 feet) long. If you make them larger, keep the same 2:3 ratio. The signal arms or legs should be 1 meter (3 feet) wide and 1 meter (3 feet) high to ensure maximum visibility from high altitudes. Ensure the signal contrasts greatly with the ground it is on. The signal may be constructed from any available materials; for example, aircraft parts, logs, or leaves. Remember size, ratio, angularity, stra ight lines, and square corners are not found in nature. You must consider how the signal will contrast with the natural background. The signal may be made by breaking and bending over crops or ta ll grass in a field or trampled down into snow or sandy soil. Place it in an open area easily spotted from the air. If evading, the signal could al so be dug into the ground to reduce its signature from ground forces."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":" 200 Figure 19-6. Ground-to-Air Emerg ency Code (Pattern Signals) BODY SIGNALS 19-40. When an aircraft is close enough for the p ilot to see you clearly, use body movements or positions (Figure 19-7 ) to convey a message. Figure 19-7. Body Signals PANEL SIGNALS 19-41.

Once the pilot of a fixed-wing aircraft has sight ed you, he will normally indicate he has seen you by flying low, moving the plane, and flashing lights as shown in Figure 19-9 . Be ready to relay other messages to the pilot once he acknowledges that he received and understood your first message. Use a radio, if possible, to relay further me ssages. If no radio is available, us e the codes covered in the previous paragraphs."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":" 202 Figure 19-9. Aircraft Acknowledgments AIRCRAFT VECTORING PROCEDURES 19-43. To establish initial contact, use beacon for 15 seconds, use voice for 15 seconds (Mayday, Mayday, Mayday—this is call sign), th en listen for 15 seconds. When you c ontact a friendly aircraft with a radio, guide the pilot to your location. Use the following gene ral format to guide the pilot: • Call sign (if any). • Name. • Location (clock direction and distan ce from aircraft to your location). • Enemy disposition and location. • Number of people needing to be rescued. • Available landing sites. • Any remarks such as medical aid or other specific types of help needed immediately. • Give any guidance or steering corrections to the p ilot from their perspective to remove any chance of error. For example, if the aircraft needs to tu rn left to pass over your position, tell the pilot to steer left. As he begins to come close to the correct heading, tell him to \"roll out.\" Continue to make corrections as necessary to align the aircraft with you. Give the pilot estimat es of distance from you as well, and be prepared to give a countdown to your position. Example: \"You are one mile out... one-half mile out... you'll be over my pos ition in ten seconds, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, mark.\" This will aid the pilot in estimating your range over the plane's nose. Remember that pilots may not be able to se e straight down, only out in front of them at an angle depending on the aircraft design."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":" 203 19-44. Simply because you have made contact with rescuers does not mean you are safe. Follow instructions and continue to use sound survival and evasion techniques until you are actually rescued. Chapter 20 Survival Movement In Hostile Areas The \"rescue at any cost\" philosophy of previous conflicts is not likely to be possible in future conflicts. Our potential adversaries have made great progress in air defense meas ures and radio direction finder (RDF) techniques. We must assume that U.S. milita ry forces trapped behind enemy lines in future conflicts may not experience quick recovery by frie ndly elements. Soldiers may have to move for extended times and distances to places less threateni ng to the recovery forces. The soldier will not likely know the type of recovery to expe ct. Each situation and the availabl e resources determine the type of recovery possible. Since no one can be absolutely sure until the recovery effort begins, soldiers facing a potential cutoff from friendly forces should be familiar with all the possible types of recovery, their related problems, and their responsibi lities to the recovery effort. Prep aration and training can improve the chances of success. PHASES OF PLANNING 20-1. Preparation is a requirement for all missions . When planning, you must consider how to avoid capture and return to your unit. Evasion plans must be prepared in conjunction with unit standing operating procedures (SOPs) and curre nt joint doctrine. You must also consider any courses of action (COAs) that you or your unit will take. EVASION PLAN OF ACTION 20-2. Successful evasion is dependent on effective pr ior planning. The responsibility ultimately rests on the individual concerned. Sound evasion planning should incorporate intelligence briefings—selected areas for evasion; area intelligence descriptions; E&R area studies; survival, evasion, resistance, and escape (SERE) guides and bulletins; isolated personnel reports; and an evasion plan of action (EPA). 20-3. The study and research needed to develop the EP A will make you aware of the current situation in your mission area. Your EPA will let recovery forces know your probable actions should you have to move to avoid capture. 20-4. You should start preparing even before premission planning. Portions of the EPA are the unit SOP. Include the EPA in your training. Pla nning starts in your daily training. 20-5. The EPA is your entire plan for your return to friendl y control. It consists of five paragraphs written in the operation order format. You can take most of Paragraph I—Situation, with you on the mission. Appendix I contains the EPA format and indicates what portion of the EPA you can take on the mission. 20-6. A comprehensive EPA is a valuable asset to th e soldier trapped behind enemy lines attempting to avoid capture. To complete Paragraph I, know your unit's assigned area or concentrate on potential mission areas of the world. Many open or closed sources contain the info rmation you need to complete an EPA. Open sources may include newspapers, ma gazines, country or area handbooks, area studies, television, radio, internet, persons familiar with th e area, and libraries. Use caution with open source information; it may be unreliable. Closed sources may include area studies, area assessments, SERE"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":" 204 contingency guides, SECRET Internet Protocol Router Ne twork, various classified field manuals, and intelligence reports. 20-7. Prepare your EPA in three phases. During your normal training, prepare Paragraph I—Situation. Prepare Paragraphs II, III, IV, and V during your premission planning. After deployment into an area, continually update your EPA based on situation or mission changes and intelligence updates. 20-8. The EPA is a guide. You may a dd or delete certain portions based on the mission. The EPA may be a recovery force's only means of determining your locati on and intentions after you st art to evade. It is an essential tool for your survival and return to friendly control. STANDING OPERATING PROCEDURES 20-9. Your unit SOPs are valuable tools that will he lp you plan your EPA. When faced with a dangerous situation requiring immediate action, it is not the time to discuss options; it is the time to act. Many of the techniques used during small unit movement can be carried over to fit requirements for moving and returning to friendly control. Items from th e SOP should include, but are not limited to— • Movement team size (three to four persons per team). • Team communications (technical and nontechnical). • Essential equipment. • Actions at danger areas. • Signaling techniques. • Immediate action drills. • Linkup procedures. • Helicopter recovery devices and procedures. • Security procedures during m ovement and at hide sites. • Rally points. 20-10. Rehearsals work effectively for reinforcing these SOP skills and also provide opportunities for evaluation and improvement. NOTIFICATION TO MO VE AND AVOID CAPTURE 20-11. An isolated unit has several general COAs it can take to avoid the capture of the group or individuals. These COAs are not co urses the commander can choose instead of his original mission. He cannot arbitrarily abandon the assigned mission. Rath er, he may adopt these COAs after completing his mission when his unit cannot complete its assigned mission (because of combat power losses) or when he receives orders to extract his unit from its current position. If such actions are not possible, the commander may decide to have the unit try to move to avoid capture and return to friendly control. In either case, as long as there is communication with higher headquarters, that headquarters will make the decision. 20-12. If the unit commander loses contact with higher headquarters, he must make the decision to move or wait. He bases his decision on many factors, including the mission, rations and ammunition on hand, casualties, the chance of relief by friendly forces, and the tactical situation. The commander of an isolated unit faces other questions. What CO A will inflict maximum damage on th e enemy? What COA will assist in completing the higher h eadquarters' overall mission?"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":" 205 20-13. Movement teams conduct the execution portion of the plan when notified by higher headquarters or, if there is no contac t with higher headquarters, when the highest ranking person decides that the situation requires the unit to try to escape capture or destruction. M ovement team leaders receive their notification through prebriefed signals. Once the signal to try to a void capture is given, it must be passed rapidly to all personnel. Notify highe r headquarters, if possible. If unable to communicate with higher headquarters, leaders must recognize that organized resistance has ende d, and that organizational control has ceased. Command and control is now at the movement team or indi vidual level and is returned to higher organizational control only after reaching friendly lines. EXECUTION 20-14. Upon notification to avoid capture, all movement team members will try to link up at the initial evasion point (IEP). This point is where team members rally and act ually begin their evasion. Tentatively select the IEP during your plan ning phase through a map reconnaissance. Once on the ground, the team verifies this location or selects a better one. All team members must know its location. The IEP should be easy to locate and occupy for a minimum amount of time. 20-15. Once the team has rallied at the IEP, it must— • Give first aid. • Inventory its equipment (decide what to abandon, destroy, or take along). • Apply camouflage. • Make sure everyone knows th e tentative hide locations. • Ensure everyone knows the primary and alternate r outes and rally points en route to the hide locations. • Always maintain security. • Split the team into smaller elements. The ideal element should have two to three members; however, it could include more depending on team equipment and experience. 20-16. The movement portion of returning to friendly c ontrol is the most danger ous as you are now most vulnerable. It is usually better to move at night becau se of the concealment darkness offers. Exceptions to such movement would be when moving through hazar dous terrain or dense ve getation (for example, jungle or mountainous terrain). When moving, avoid the following even if it takes more time and energy to bypass: • Obstacles and barriers. • Roads and trails. • Inhabited areas. • Waterways and bridges. • Natural lines of drift. • Man-made structures. • All civilian and military personnel. 20-17. Movement in enemy-held territory is a very sl ow and deliberate process. The slower you move and the more careful you are, the better. Your best security will be using your senses. Use your eyes and ears to detect people before they detect you. Make freque nt listening halts. In day light, observe a section of your route before you move along it. The distance you travel before you hide will depend on the enemy situation, your health, the terrain, the availability of cover and concealment for hiding, and the amount of darkness left. See Chapter 22 for more movement and countertracking techniques."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":" 206 20-18. Once you have moved into the area in which you want to hide (hide area), select a hide site. Keep the word BLISS in mind when selecting a hide site: • B-Blends in with the surroundings. • L-Low in silhouette. • I-Irregular in shape. • S-Small in size. • S-Secluded. 20-19. Avoid the use of existing buildings or shelters. Usually, your best option will be to crawl into the thickest vegetation you can find. Construct any type of shelte r within the hide area only in cold weather and desert environments. If you build a shelter, follow the BLISS formula. HIDE SITE ACTIVITIES 20-20. After you have located your hide site, do not m ove straight into it. Use a buttonhook or other deceptive technique to move to a position outside of the hide site. Conduct a listening halt before moving individually into the hide site. Be careful not to disturb or cut any vegetati on. Once you have occupied the hide site, limit your activities to maintaining secu rity, resting, camouflaging, and planning your next moves. 20-21. Maintain your security throug h visual scanning and listening. Upon detection of the enemy, the security personnel alert all personnel, even if the t eam's plan is to stay hidden and not move upon sighting the enemy. Take this action so that everyone is aware of the danger and ready to react. 20-22. If any team member leaves the team, give hi m a five-point contingenc y plan. It should include— Who is going? Where are they going? How long will they be gone? What to do if they are hit or don't return on time? Where to go if anyone is hit? 20-23. It is extremely important to stay healthy and alert when tr ying to avoid capture. Take every opportunity to rest, but do not sacrif ice security. Rotate se curity so that all me mbers of your movement team can rest. Treat all injuries, no matter how minor. Loss of your health will mean loss of your ability to continue to avoid capture. 20-24. Camouflage is an important aspect of both moving and securing a hide site. Always use a buddy system to ensure that camouflage is complete. Ensu re that team members ble nd with the hide site. Use natural or man-made materials. If you add any additio nal camouflage material to the hide site, do not cut vegetation in the immediate area. 20-25. Plan your next actions while at the hide site. Start your planning process immediately upon occupying the hide site. Inform all team members of th eir current location and desi gnate an alternate hide site location. Once this is done, start planning for the team's next movement. 20-26. Planning the team's movement begins with a ma p reconnaissance. Choose th e next hide area first. Then choose a primary and an alternate route to the hi de area. In choosing the routes, do not use straight lines. Use one or two radical changes in direction. Pick the routes that offer the best cover and concealment, the fewest obstacles, and the least li kelihood of contact with humans. There should be locations along the route where the team can get water. To aid team navigation, use azimuths, distances,"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":" 207 checkpoints or steering marks, and corridors. Plan rally points and re ndezvous points at intervals along the route. 20-27. Other planning considerations may fall under what the team al ready has in the team SOP. Examples are immediate action drills, actions on sighting the enemy, and hand-and-arm signals. 20-28. Once planning is complete, ensure everyone knows and memorizes the entire plan. The team members should know the distances and azimuths for the entire route to the next hide area. They should study the map and know the various terrain they will be moving across so that they can move without using the map. 20-29. Do not occupy a hide site for more than 24 hours. In most situations, hide during the day and move at night. Limit your actions in the hide site to those discussed above. Once in the hide site, restrict all movement to less than 45 centimeters (18 inches) above the ground. Do not build fires or prepare food. Smoke and food odors will reveal your location. Before leaving the hide site, sterilize it to prevent tracking. HOLE-UP AREAS 20-30. After moving and hiding for several days, usually three or four, you or the movement team will have to move into a hole-up area. This is an area where you can rest, recupera te, and get and prepare food. Choose an area near a water source. You then have a place to get water, to place fishing devices, and to trap game. Since waterways are a lin e of communication, locate your hide site well away from the water. 20-31. The hole-up area should offer plenty of cover and concealment for movement in and around the area. Always maintain security while in the hole- up area. Always man the hol e-up area. Actions in the hole-up area are the same as in the hide site, except that you can move away from the hole-up area to get and prepare food. While in the hole-up area, you can— • Select and occupy the next hide s ite (remember you are still in a da ngerous situation; this is not a friendly area). • Reconnoiter the area for resources and potential con cealed movement routes to the alternate hide site. • Gather food (nuts, berries, vegetables). When moving around the area for f ood, maintain security and avoid leaving tracks or ot her signs. When setting traps and snares, keep them well- camouflaged and in areas where people are not likely to discover them. Remember, the local population sometimes heavily travels trails near water sources. • Get water from sources within the hide area. Be careful not to leave tracks of signs along the banks of water sources when getting water. Movi ng on hard rocks or logs along the banks to get water will reduce the signs you leave. • Set clandestine fishing devices, such as stakeo uts, below the surface of the water to avoid detection. • Locate a fire site well away from the hide site . Use this site to prep are food or boil water. Camouflage and sterilize the fire site after each us e. Be careful that smoke and light from the fire does not compromise the hole-up area. 20-32. While in the hole-up area, security is stil l your primary concern. Designate team members to perform specific tasks. To limit movement around th e area, you may have a two-man team perform more"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":" 208 than one task. For example, the team getting water could also set the fishing devices. Do not occupy the hole-up area longer than 72 hours. RETURN TO FRIENDLY CONTROL 20-33. Establishing contact with friendly lines or patrols is the most cruc ial part of movement and return to friendly control. All your pati ence, planning, and hardships will be in vain if you do not exercise caution when contacting friendly frontline forces. Frie ndly patrols have killed personnel operating behind enemy lines because they did not make contact properl y. Most of the casualties could have been avoided if caution had been exercised and a few simple pro cedures followed. The normal tendency is to throw caution to the wind when in sight of friendly forces. You must overcome this tendency and understand that linkup is a very sensitive situation. BORDER CROSSINGS 20-34. If you have made your way to a friendly or neut ral country, use the following procedures to cross the border and link up with friend ly forces on the other side: • Occupy a hide site on the near side of the borde r and send a team out to reconnoiter the potential crossing site. • Surveil the crossing site for at least 24 hours, depending on the enemy situation. • Make a sketch of the site, taking note of terrai n, obstacles, guard routines and rotations, and any sensor devices or trip wires. Once the reconnaissan ce is complete, the team moves to the hide site, briefs the rest of the team, and pl ans to cross the border at night. • After crossing the border, set up a hide site on the fa r side of the border and try to locate friendly positions. Do not reveal your presence. • Depending on the size of your movement team, have two men surveil the potential linkup site with friendly forces until satisfied that the personnel are indeed friendly. • Make contact with the friendly fo rces during daylight. Personnel c hosen to make contact should be unarmed, have no equipment, and have positive identification readily available. The person who actually makes the linkup should be some one who looks least like the enemy. • During the actual contact, have only one person make the contact. The other person provides the security and observes the link-up area from a safe distance. The obser ver should be far enough away so that he can warn the rest of the movement team if something goes wrong. • Wait until the party he is contacti ng looks in his direction so that he does not surprise the contact. He stands up from behind cover, with hands overhead and states that he is an American. After this, he follows any instructions given him. He avoi ds answering any tactical questions and does not give any indication that ther e are other team members. • Reveal that there are other personnel with him only after verifying his identity and satisfying himself he has made contact with friendly forces. 20-35. Language problems or difficulties confirming identities may arise. The movement team should maintain security, be patient, and have a contingency plan. NOTE: If you are moving to a neutral country, you are su rrendering to that power and become a detained person. LINKUP AT THE FORWARD EDGE OF THE BA TTLE AREA OR FORWARD LINE OF OWN TROOPS"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":" 209 20-36. If caught between friendly an d enemy forces and there is heavy fighting in the area, you may choose to hide and let the friendl y lines pass over you. If overrun by frie ndly forces, you may try to link up from their rear during daylight hours. If overr un by enemy forces, you may move further to the enemy rear, try to move to the forward e dge of the battle area or forward lin e of own troops during a lull in the fighting, or move to anot her area along the front. 20-37. The actual linkup will be done as for linkup duri ng a border crossing. The only difference is that you must be more careful on the ini tial contact. Frontline personnel are mo re likely to shoot first and ask questions later, especially in area s of heavy fighting. You should be near or behind cover before trying to make contact. LINKUP WITH FRIENDLY PATROLS 20-38. If friendly lines are a circul ar perimeter or an isolated cam p, for example, any direction you approach from will be considered enemy territory. You do not have the option of moving behind the lines and trying to link up. This move makes the linkup ex tremely dangerous. One option you have is to place the perimeter under observation and wait for a friendly pa trol to move out in your direction, providing a chance for a linkup. You may also occupy a position out side of the perimeter and call out to get the attention of the friendly forces. Id eally, display anything that is wh ite while making contact. If nothing else is available, use any article of clothing. The idea is to draw attention while stay ing behind cover. Once you have drawn attention to your signal an d called out, follow instructions given to you. 20-39. Be constantly on the alert for friendly patrols be cause these provide a means for return to friendly control. Find a concealed position that allows you maximum visual coverage of the area. Try to memorize every terrain feature so that, if necessary, you can infiltrate to frie ndly positions under the cover of darkness. Remember, trying to infiltrate in darkness is extremely dangerous. 20-40. Because of the missions of combat and reconnaissance patrol s and where they are operating, making contact can be dangerous. If you decide not to make contact, you can observe their route and approach friendly lines at about the same location. Such observation will enable you to avoid mines and booby traps. 20-41. Once you have spotted a patrol, remain in position and, if possible, allow the patrol to move toward you. When the patrol is 25 to 50 meters (83 to 165 feet) from your position, signal them and call out a greeting that is clearly and unmistakably of American origin. 20-42. If you have nothing white, an article of clothing will suffice to draw atte ntion. If the distance is greater than 50 meters (165 feet), a reconnaissance patrol may a void contact and bypass your position. If the distance is less than 25 meters (83 feet), a patrol member may react instantly by firing a fatal shot. 20-43. It is crucial, at the time of contact, that there is enough light fo r the patrol to identify you as an American. 20-44. Whatever linkup technique you d ecide to use, use extreme cauti on. From the perspective of the friendly patrol or friendly pers onnel occupying a perimeter, you are hostile until they make positive identification. Chapter 21"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":" 210 Camouflage In a survival situation, especia lly in a hostile environment, you ma y find it necessary to camouflage yourself, your equipment, and your movement. Effec tive camouflage may mean the difference between survival and capture by the enemy. Camouflage and move ment techniques, such as stalking, will also help you get animals or game for food using primitive weapons and skills. PERSONAL CAMOUFLAGE 21-1. When camouflaging yourself, consid er that certain shapes are part icular to humans. The enemy will look for these shapes. The shape of a hat, helmet, or black boots can give you away. Even animals know and run from the shape of a human silhouette. Break up your outline by placing small amounts of vegetation from the surrounding area in your uniform, equipment, and headgear. Try to reduce any shine from skin or equipment. Blend in with the su rrounding colors and simulate the texture of your surroundings. SHAPE AND OUTLINE 21-2. Change the outline of weapons and equipment by tying vegetation or stri ps of cloth onto them. Make sure the added camouflage does not hinder the equipment's ope ration. When hiding, cover yourself and your equipment with leaves, grass, or other local debris. Conceal any signaling devices you have prepared, but keep th em ready for use. COLOR AND TEXTURE 21-3. Each area of the world and each climatic condition (arctic/winter, temperate/jungle, or swamp/desert) has color pa tterns and textures that are natural for that area. While color is self- explanatory, texture defines the surface characteristic s of something when looking at it. For example, surface textures may be smooth, rough, rocky, leafy, or many other possible combinations. Use color and texture together to camouflage yourself effectively. It makes little sense to cover yourself with dead, brown vegetation in the middle of a large grassy fi eld. Similarly, it would be useless to camouflage yourself with green grass in the middle of a desert or rocky area. 21-4. To hide and camouflage movement in any specific area of the world, you must take on the color and texture of the immediate surroundings. Use natural or man-made materials to camouflage yourself. A few examples include camouflage paint, charcoal from bur ned paper or wood, mud, grass, leaves, strips of cloth or burlap, pine boughs, and camouflaged uniforms. 21-5. Cover all areas of exposed skin, including f ace, hands, neck, and ears. Use camouflage paint, charcoal, or mud to camouflage yourse lf. Cover areas that stick out more and catch more light (forehead, nose, cheekbones, chin, and ears) with a darker color. Cover other areas, particul arly recessed or shaded areas (around the eyes and under the ch in), with lighter colors. Be sure to use an irregula r pattern. Attach vegetation from the area or strips of cloth of the proper color to clothing and equipment. If you use vegetation, replace it as it wilts. As you move through an area, be alert to the color changes and modify your camouflage colors as necessary. 21-6. Figure 21-1 gives a general idea of how to apply cam ouflage for various areas and climates. Use appropriate colors for your surroundings. The blotch es or slashes will help to simulate texture."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":" 211 Figure 21-1. Camouflage Methods for Specific Areas SHINE 21-7. As skin gets oily, it becomes shiny. Equipmen t with worn-off paint is also shiny. Even painted objects, if smooth, may shine. Glass objects such as mirrors, glasses, bi noculars, and telescopes shine. You must cover these glass objects when not in use. Anything that shines will automatically attract attention and will give away your location. 21-8. Whenever possible, wash oily skin and reappl y camouflage. Skin oil will wash off camouflage, so reapply it frequently. If you must wear glasses, camouflage them by appl ying a thin layer of dust to the outside of the lenses. This layer of dust will reduce the reflection of light. Cover shiny spots on equipment by painting, covering with mud, or wra pping with cloth or tape. Pay partic ular attention to covering boot eyelets, buckles on equipment, watches and jewelry, zippers, and uniform insignia. Carry a signal mirror in its designed pouch or in a pocket with the mirror portion facing your body. SHADOW 21-9. When hiding or traveling, stay in the deepest part of the shadow s. The outer edges of the shadows are lighter and the deeper parts are darker. Remember , if you are in an area wh ere there is plenty of vegetation, keep as much vegetation between you a nd a potential enemy as po ssible. This action will make it very hard for the enemy to see you as th e vegetation will partially mask you from his view. Forcing an enemy to look through many layers of mask ing vegetation will fatigue his eyes very quickly. 21-10. When traveling, especially in built-up areas at night, be aware of where you cast your shadow. It may extend out around the corner of a building and gi ve away your position. Also, if you are in a dark shadow and there is a light source to one side, an enemy on the other side can see your silhouette against the light. MOVEMENT 21-11. Movement, especially fast movement, attracts attention. If possible, avoid movement in the presence of an enemy. If capture appears imminent in your present location and you must move, move away slowly, making as litt le noise as possible. By moving slowly in a survival situation, you decrease the chance of detection and conser ve energy that you may need for long- term survival or long-distance evasion. 21-12. When moving past obstacles, avoid going over them. If you must climb over an obstacle, keep your body level with its top to avoid silhouetting yourself. Do not silhou ette yourself against the skyline"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":" 212 when crossing hills or ridges. When you are moving, you will have difficulty detecting the movement of others. Stop frequently, listen, and look around slowly to detect signs of hostile movement. NOISE 21-13. Noise attracts attention, especi ally if there is a se quence of loud noises such as several snapping twigs. If possible, avoid making a ny noise. Slow your pace as much as necessary to avoid making noise when moving around or away from possible threats. 21-14. Use background noises to cove r the noise of your movement. Sounds of aircraft, trucks, generators, strong winds, and people talking will cover some or all the sounds produced by your movement. Rain will mask a lot of movement noise, but it also reduces your ab ility to dete ct potential enemy noise. SCENT 21-15. Whether hunting animals or a voiding the enemy, it is always wise to camouflage the scent associated with humans. Start by washing yourself and your clothes without using soap. This washing method removes soap and body odors. Avoiding strong sm elling foods, such as garlic, helps reduce body odors. Do not use tobacco products, candy, gum, or cosmetics. 21-16. You can use aromatic herbs or plants to wash yourself and your clothing, to rub on your body and clothing, or to chew on to camouflag e your breath. Pine needles, mint, or any similar aromatic plant will help camouflage your scent from both animals and huma ns. Standing in smoke from a fire can help mask your scent from animals. While animals are afraid of fresh smoke from a fire, older smoke scents are normal smells after forest fires and do not scare them. 21-17. While traveling, use your sense of smell to help you find or avoid humans. Pay attention to smells associated with humans, such as fire, cigarettes, ga soline, oil, soap, and food. Such smells may alert you to their presence long before you can see or hear th em, depending on wind speed and direction. Note the wind's direction and, when possible, approach from or skirt around on the downwind side when nearing humans or animals. METHODS OF STALKING 21-18. Sometimes you need to move, undetected, to or from a location. You need more than just camouflage to make these moves successfully. The ab ility to stalk or move without making any sudden quick movement or loud noise is essential to avoiding detection. Always pick your route carefully to keep you concealed; use trenches, slight rises in terrai n, thick vegetation for concealment. Avoid lateral movement to the observer unless you have good conceal ment, otherwise stalk straight in toward the observer. 21-19. You must practice stalking if it is to be effective. Use the follo wing techniques when practicing. UPRIGHT STALKING 21-20. Take steps about half your norma l stride when stalking in the up right position. Such strides help you to maintain your balance. You should be able to stop at any point in that movement and hold that position as long as necessary. Curl the toes up out of the way when stepping down so the outside edge of"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":" 213 the ball of the foot touches the ground. Feel for sticks and twigs that may snap when you place your weight on them. If you start to step on one, lift your foot and move it. After making contact with the outside edge of the ball of your foot , roll to the inside ball of your foot, place your heel down, followed by your toes. Then gradually shift your weight forward to the front foot. Lift the back foot to about knee height and start the process over again. 21-21. Keep your hands and arms close to your body a nd avoid waving them about or hitting vegetation. When moving in a crouch, you gain extra support by placing your hands on your knees. One step usually takes 1 minute to complete, but the tim e it takes will depend on the situation. CRAWLING 21-22. Crawl on your hands and knees when the vegeta tion is too low to allow you to walk upright without being seen. Move one limb at a time and be sure to set it down softly, feeling for anything that may snap and make noise. Be careful that your toes and heels do not catch on vegetation. PRONE STAKING 21-23. To stalk in the prone position, you do a low, modified push-up on your hands and toes, moving yourself forward slightly, and then lowering yours elf again slowly. Avoid dragging and scraping along the ground as this makes excessive noise and le aves large trails for trackers to follow. ANIMAL STALKING 21-24. Before stalking an animal, select the best route. If the animal is moving, you will need an intercepting route. Pick a route th at puts objects between you and the animal to conceal your movement from it. By positioning yourself in this way, you will be able to move faster, until you pass that object. Some objects such as large rocks and trees may tota lly conceal you, and others such as small bushes and grass may only partially conceal you. Pick the route that offers the best concealment and requires the least amount of effort. 21-25. Keep your eyes on the animal and stop when it looks your way or turns its ears your way, especially if it suspects your pres ence. As you get close, squint your ey es slightly to conceal both the light-dark contrast of the whites of the eyes and any shine from your eyes. Keep your mouth closed so that the animal does not see the whiteness or shine of your teeth. ANTITRACKING 21-26. Along with camouflage of your body, you need to camouflage your movement from visual trackers. Antitracking techniques should be used; countertracking techniques are of little use to the evader, as they would pinpoint his location or route. During movement this can be accomplished by using the following methods: • Restore vegetation—Use a stick to lift the ve getation you crushed down during movement through it. This can slow you down and it is hard to tell if you are being effective. • Brush out tracks—Use a tree branch to brush or pa t out tracks in open ground. This is effective in concealing the number in the party, but leaves obvious signs in itself. • Use hard or stony ground—Using this type of terrain minimizes the signs you leave slowing the visual tracker."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":" 214 • Make abrupt direction changes—Using this tech nique combined with the use of hard or stony ground can be very effective in slowing the visual tracker as it will be much harder to detect the direction change. • Use well-used paths—Although the use of paths is not advisable, there may be times you can use them to your advantage. For example, if you have been in an area long eno ugh to surveil the path to determine the traffic patterns, you could use the path prior to a farmer moving a heard of cows down the path, eliminating your sign. • Use foot coverings—They can assist in aging or virtually eliminati ng your signs. Examples include sandbags, rags, old sock s, or commercial foot covering s made from imitation sheepskin (these seem to work the best). • Change footgear—Use this method in an area such as hard or stony ground. Vary the tread pattern. • Use custom footgear—Militaries ge nerally have a standard issue footgear, although with the world economy, this is changing. If you know that the area you are working in has a standard issue footgear, you may want to acquire a pair or have that tread pa ttern put on your boots. • Walk backwards—This can be useful at times but there are pitfalls to avoid. Avoid turning your foot out. When you look over your left shoulder your left foot tends to turn outward and visa versa. Avoid dragging dirt backwards. Try to pl ace your footfalls so that the toe indention is deeper than your heel indention to give the appearance of moving forward. • Confuse the start point—Whatever the point on the ground yo u start your evasion, try to confuse it by walking numerous cloverleaf patt erns out of and back into it be fore you leave on your initial route (this can assist in delaying dog trackers also). • Use streams, lakes, waterways—This is a judgement call on your part. Ask yourself: Is the stream moving in the direction you need to go? Is it fast or slow moving water? Will it put you that much farther ahead of the trackers ? (Note: You will leave more signs upon exiting the water.) • Crossing roads or paths with the traffic pattern—W hen crossing roads or paths try to cross with the direction of travel, not perpendi cular, this will assist in your tr acks blending into normal traffic patterns and making them harder to follow. • Careful placement of footfalls leaving little heel or toe dig—Try to leave as little sign as possible. Last but not least, always vary your techniques so as not to educat e the tracker as to what to look for if he loses the track! ANTIDOG TRACKING 21-27. When trying to elude dog trackers always remember you are trying to beat the handler not the dog! Whatever you do, it should be done to either tire the handler or decrease the handler's confidence in his dog. Some techniques to use against dog tracker teams are as follows: • Open ground—Although this is a danger area, if the wind is high it will blow the scent to vegetated areas; thus the team will not be dir ectly on your tracks and it will slow the team's progression. • Thick terrain—Using a zigzag pattern of moveme nt will slow and tire the handler and possibly decrease the handler's confidence. • Hard or stony ground—In high winds or high temper atures these areas will dissipate your scent quicker, increasing the chance of the dog losing the track. • Crowded places—If the dog is not scent-specific trained, and you move through an area where many other people have recently been he may lose the track. • Freshly plowed or fertilized fi elds—The dog may lose the track in these areas due to the overpowering scent of fresh dirt and human or animal manure used as fertilizer (do not rely too much on this theory)."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":" 215 • Speed—Try to maintain a constant speed. Try not to run. Running increases the scent, due to more soil and vegetation disturbance and more body odor from sweat or adrenaline. • Transportation—Using a vehicle will greatly increas e your time and distance but you could still be tracked; however, it would be at a much slower pace. Chapter 21 Camouflage In a survival situation, especia lly in a hostile environment, you ma y find it necessary to camouflage yourself, your equipment, and your movement. Effec tive camouflage may mean the difference between survival and capture by the enemy. Camouflage and move ment techniques, such as stalking, will also help you get animals or game for food using primitive weapons and skills. PERSONAL CAMOUFLAGE 21-1. When camouflaging yourself, consid er that certain shapes are part icular to humans. The enemy will look for these shapes. The shape of a hat, helmet, or black boots can give you away. Even animals know and run from the shape of a human silhouette. Break up your outline by placing small amounts of vegetation from the surrounding area in your uniform, equipment, and headgear. Try to reduce any shine from skin or equipment. Blend in with the su rrounding colors and simulate the texture of your surroundings. SHAPE AND OUTLINE 21-2. Change the outline of weapons and equipment by tying vegetation or stri ps of cloth onto them. Make sure the added camouflage does not hinder the equipment's ope ration. When hiding, cover yourself and your equipment with leaves, grass, or other local debris. Conceal any signaling devices you have prepared, but keep th em ready for use. COLOR AND TEXTURE 21-3. Each area of the world and each climatic condition (arctic/winter, temperate/jungle, or swamp/desert) has color pa tterns and textures that are natural for that area. While color is self- explanatory, texture defines the surface characteristic s of something when looking at it. For example, surface textures may be smooth, rough, rocky, leafy, or many other possible combinations. Use color and texture together to camouflage yourself effectively. It makes little sense to cover yourself with dead, brown vegetation in the middle of a large grassy fi eld. Similarly, it would be useless to camouflage yourself with green grass in the middle of a desert or rocky area. 21-4. To hide and camouflage movement in any specific area of the world, you must take on the color and texture of the immediate surroundings. Use natural or man-made materials to camouflage yourself. A few examples include camouflage paint, charcoal from bur ned paper or wood, mud, grass, leaves, strips of cloth or burlap, pine boughs, and camouflaged uniforms. 21-5. Cover all areas of exposed skin, including f ace, hands, neck, and ears. Use camouflage paint, charcoal, or mud to camouflage yourse lf. Cover areas that stick out more and catch more light (forehead, nose, cheekbones, chin, and ears) with a darker color. Cover other areas, particul arly recessed or shaded areas (around the eyes and under the ch in), with lighter colors. Be sure to use an irregula r pattern. Attach"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":" 216 vegetation from the area or strips of cloth of the proper color to clothing and equipment. If you use vegetation, replace it as it wilts. As you move through an area, be alert to the color changes and modify your camouflage colors as necessary. 21-6. Figure 21-1 gives a general idea of how to apply cam ouflage for various areas and climates. Use appropriate colors for your surroundings. The blotch es or slashes will help to simulate texture. Figure 21-1. Camouflage Methods for Specific Areas SHINE 21-7. As skin gets oily, it becomes shiny. Equipmen t with worn-off paint is also shiny. Even painted objects, if smooth, may shine. Glass objects such as mirrors, glasses, bi noculars, and telescopes shine. You must cover these glass objects when not in use. Anything that shines will automatically attract attention and will give away your location. 21-8. Whenever possible, wash oily skin and reappl y camouflage. Skin oil will wash off camouflage, so reapply it frequently. If you must wear glasses, camouflage them by appl ying a thin layer of dust to the outside of the lenses. This layer of dust will reduce the reflection of light. Cover shiny spots on equipment by painting, covering with mud, or wra pping with cloth or tape. Pay partic ular attention to covering boot eyelets, buckles on equipment, watches and jewelry, zippers, and uniform insignia. Carry a signal mirror in its designed pouch or in a pocket with the mirror portion facing your body. SHADOW 21-9. When hiding or traveling, stay in the deepest part of the shadow s. The outer edges of the shadows are lighter and the deeper parts are darker. Remember , if you are in an area wh ere there is plenty of vegetation, keep as much vegetation between you a nd a potential enemy as po ssible. This action will make it very hard for the enemy to see you as th e vegetation will partially mask you from his view. Forcing an enemy to look through many layers of mask ing vegetation will fatigue his eyes very quickly. 21-10. When traveling, especially in built-up areas at night, be aware of where you cast your shadow. It may extend out around the corner of a building and gi ve away your position. Also, if you are in a dark shadow and there is a light source to one side, an enemy on the other side can see your silhouette against the light. MOVEMENT"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":" 217 21-11. Movement, especially fast movement, attracts attention. If possible, avoid movement in the presence of an enemy. If capture appears imminent in your present location and you must move, move away slowly, making as litt le noise as possible.

Chapter 23 Survival In Man-Made Hazards Nuclear, chemical, and biological (NBC) weapons have become pot ential realities on any modern battlespace. Recent experience in Afghanistan, Cambodia, and other ar eas of conflict has proved the use of chemical and biological weapons (such as mycotoxins). The warfigh ting doctrine of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and former Wars aw Pact nations addresses the use of both nuclear and chemical weapons. The potential use of these weapons intensifie s the problems of survival because of the serious dangers posed by either radi oactive fallout or contamination produced by persistent biological or chemical agents. You must use special precautions if you expect to survive in these man- made hazards. If you are subjected to any of the effects of nuclear, ch emical, or biological warfare, the survival procedures recommended in this chapter may save your life. This chapter presents some b ackground information on each type of hazard so you may better understand the true nature of the hazard. Awareness of the hazards, knowledge of this chapter, and application of common sense can keep you alive. THE NUCLEAR ENVIRONMENT 23-1. Prepare yourself to survive in a nuclear environm ent. Make sure you know what to expect and how to react to a nuclear hazard. EFFECTS OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS 23-2. The effects of nuclear weapons are classified as ei ther initial or residual. In itial effects occur in the immediate area of the explosion and are hazardous in the first minute after the explosion. Residual effects can last for days or years and cause death. The principal initial effects are blast and radiation. Blast 23-3. Blast is the brief and rapid movement of air away from the explosion's center and the pressure accompanying this movement. Strong winds accompany the blast. Blast hurls debris and personnel, collapses lungs, ruptures eardrums, collapses structures and positions, and causes immediate death or injury with its crushing effect. Thermal Radiation"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":" 221 23-4. This effect is the heat and li ght radiation a nuclear explosion's fi reball emits. Light radiation consists of both visible light and ultraviolet and infrared light. Thermal radiat ion produces extensive fires, skin burns, and flash blindness. Nuclear Radiation 23-5. Nuclear radiation breaks down into two categories. The effects can be initial radiation and residual radiation. 23-6. Initial nuclear radiation cons ists of intense gamma rays and neutrons produced during the first minute after the explosion. This radiation cause s extensive damage to cells throughout the body. Radiation damage may cause headaches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and even death, depending on the radiation dose received. The major pr oblem in protecting yourself against the initial radiation's effects is that you may have received a lethal or incapacitati ng dose before taking any pr otective action. Personnel exposed to lethal amounts of initia l radiation may well have been kill ed or fatally injured by blast or thermal radiation. 23-7. Residual radiation consists of all radiation produced after 1 minut e from the explosion. It has more effect on you than initial radiati on. A discussion of residual radiati on takes place in a subsequent paragraph. TYPES OF NUCLEAR BURSTS 23-8. There are three types of nuclear bursts: subsurf ace burst, airburst, and surface burst. The type of burst directly affects your chances of survival. A subsurface burst occurs completely underground or underwater. Its effects remain beneat h the surface or in the immediat e area where the surface collapses into a crater over the burst's location. Subsurface bursts cause you little or no radioactive hazard unless you enter the immediate area of the crater. 23-9. An airburst occurs in the air above its intended target. The airb urst provides the maximum radiation effect on the target and is, therefore, most dangerous to you in terms of immediate nuclear effects. 23-10. A surface burst occurs on the ground or water surface. Large amounts of fallout result, with serious long-term effects for you. This type of burst is your greatest nuclear hazard. NUCLEAR INJURIES 23-11. Most injuries in the nuclear environment result from the initial nuclear effects of the detonation. These injuries are classed as blast, thermal, or radiation injuries. Furt her radiation injuries may occur if you do not take proper precautions against fallout. Indi viduals in the area near a nuclear explosion will probably suffer a combination of all three types of injuries. Blast Injuries 23-12. Blast injuries produced by nuclear weapons are similar to those caused by conventional high- explosive weapons. Blast overpressure can collapse lungs and rupture in ternal organs. Projectile wounds occur as the explosion's force hurls debris at you. La rge pieces of debris striking you will cause fractured limbs or massive internal injuries. Blast overpre ssure may throw you long distances, and you will suffer severe injury upon impact with the ground or other objects. Substantial cover and distance from the"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":" 222 explosion are the best protection ag ainst blast injury. Cover blast inju ry wounds as soon as possible to prevent the entry of radioactive dust particles. Thermal Injuries 23-13. The heat and light the nuclear fireball emits caus e thermal injuries. First-, second-, or third-degree burns may result. Flash blindness also occurs. This blindness may be permanent or temporary depending on the degree of exposure of the eyes. Substantial cover and distance from the explosion can prevent thermal injuries. Clothing will provide significant pr otection against thermal injuries. Cover as much exposed skin as possible before a nuclear explosion. Firs t aid for thermal injuries is the same as first aid for burns. Cover open burns (second- or third-degree) to prevent the entr y of radioactive particles. Wash all burns before covering. Radiation Injuries 23-14. Neutrons, gamma radiation, alpha radiation, and beta radiation cau se radiation injuries. Neutrons are high-speed, extremely penetr ating particles that actually smash cells within your body. Gamma radiation is similar to X rays and is also highly penetr ating radiation. During the in itial fireball stage of a nuclear detonation, initial gamma ra diation and neutrons are the most serious threat. Beta and alpha radiation are radioactive pa rticles normally associated with radioact ive dust from fallout. They are short- range particles. You can easily protect yourself agains t them if you take precautions. See \"Bodily Reactions to Radiation,\" below, for the symptoms of radiation injuries. RESIDUAL RADIATION 23-15. Residual radiation is all radiation emitted after 1 minute from the instant of the nuclear explosion. Residual radiation consists of induced radiation and fallout. Induced Radiation 23-16. This term describes a relatively small, inte nsely radioactive area dir ectly underneath the nuclear weapon's fireball. The irradiated ea rth in this area will remain highly radioactive for an extremely long time. You should not travel into an area of induced radiation. Fallout 23-17. Fallout consists of radioactive soil and water particles, as well as weapon fragments. During a surface detonation, or if an airburst's nuclear fire ball touches the ground, large amounts of soil and water are vaporized along with the bomb' s fragments, and forced upward to altitudes of 25,000 meters (82,000 feet) or more. When these vaporized contents cool, they can form mo re than 200 different radioactive products. The vaporized bomb contents condense into tiny radioactive particles that the wind carries until they fall back to earth as radioac tive dust. Fallout particles emit alpha , beta, and gamma radiation. Alpha and beta radiation are relatively eas y to counteract, and residual gamm a radiation is much less intense than the gamma radiation emitted during the first minute after the explosion. Fallout is your most significant radiation hazard, provide d you have not received a lethal radiation dose from the initial radiation. BODILY REACTIONS TO RADIATION"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":" 223 23-18. The effects of radiation on th e human body can be broadly classed as either chronic or acute. Chronic effects are those that occur some years af ter exposure to radiation. Examples are cancer and genetic defects. Chronic effects are of minor concern insofar as they affect your immediat e survival in a radioactive environment. On the other hand, acute effects are of primary importance to your survival. Some acute effects occur within hours after exposure to radiation. These effects result from the radiation's direct physical damage to tissue. Radiation sickness and beta burns are examples of acute effects. Radiation sickness symptoms include nausea, diarrh ea, vomiting, fatigue, weakness, and loss of hair. Penetrating beta rays caus e radiation burns; th e wounds are similar to fire burns. Recovery Capability 23-19. The extent of body damage depends mainly on the part of the body exposed to radiation and how long it was exposed, as well as its abili ty to recover. The brain and kidneys have little rec overy capability. Other parts (skin and bone marrow) have a great abili ty to recover from damage. Usually, a dose of 600 centigrays (cGy) to the entire body w ill result in almost certain death. If only your hands received this same dose, your overall health would not suffer muc h, although your hands would suffer severe damage. External and Internal Hazards 23-20. An external or internal hazard can cause body damage. Highly penetrating gamma radiation or the less penetrating beta radiation that causes burns can cause external da mage. The entry of alpha or beta radiation-emitting particles into the body can cause internal damage . The external hazard produces overall irradiation and beta burns. The inte rnal hazard results in irradiati on of critical organs such as the gastrointestinal tract, thyroid gl and, and bone. A very small amount of radioactive material can cause extreme damage to these and other internal organs. The internal hazard can enter the body either through consumption of contaminated water or food or by abso rption through cuts or abrasions. Material that enters the body through breathing presents only a mi nor hazard. You can greatly reduce the internal radiation hazard by using good pers onal hygiene and carefully decontaminating your food and water. Symptoms 23-21. The symptoms of radiation inju ries include nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. The severity of these symptoms is due to the extreme sensitivity of the gast rointestinal tract to radi ation. The severity of the symptoms and the speed of onset after exposure are good indicators of the degree of radiation damage. The gastrointestinal damage can come from either the external or the internal radiation hazard. COUNTERMEASURES AGAINST PE NETRATING EXTERNAL RADIATION 23-22. Knowledge of the radiation hazards discussed ear lier is extremely important in surviving in a fallout area. It is also critical to know how to prot ect yourself from the most dangerous form of residual radiation—penetrating external radiation. 23-23. The means you can use to protect yourself from pe netrating external radiation are time, distance, and shielding. You can reduce the le vel of radiation and help increase your chance of survival by controlling the duration of exposure. You can also get as far away from the radiation source as possible. Finally, you can place some radiatio n-absorbing or shielding materi al between you and the radiation. Time"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":" 224 23-24. Time is important, in two ways, when you are in a survival situa tion. First, radiation dosages are cumulative. The longer you are exposed to a radioactive source, the greater the dose you will receive. Obviously, spend as little time in a radioactive area as possible. Second, radioactivity decreases or decays over time. This concept is known as radioactive half-life. Thus, a radioactive element decays or loses half of its radioactivity within a certain time. The rule of thumb for radioactiv ity decay is that it decreases in intensity by a factor of te n for every sevenfold increase in time following the peak radiation level. For example, if a nuclear fallout area had a maximum ra diation rate of 200 cGy per hour when fallout is complete, this rate would fall to 20 cGy per hour after 7 hours; it would fall still further to 2 cGy per hour after 49 hours. Even an untrained observer can see that the great est hazard from fallout occurs immediately after detonation, and th at the hazard decreases quickly over a relatively short time. You should try to avoid fallout areas until the radioactivity decays to safe le vels. If you can avoid fallout areas long enough for most of the radioactivity to decay, you enhance your chance of survival. Distance 23-25. Distance provides very effective protection agai nst penetrating gamma radi ation because radiation intensity decreases by the square of the distance from the source. For ex ample, if exposed to 1,000 cGy of radiation standing 30 centimeters (1 2 inches) from the source, at 60 centimeters (24 inches), you would only receive 250 cGy. Thus, when you double the distance, radiation decreases to (0.5) 2 or 0.25 the amount. While this formula is valid for concentrated s ources of radiation in sma ll areas, it becomes more complicated for large areas of radiation such as fallout areas. Shielding 23-26. Shielding is the most important method of pr otection from penetrating radiation. Of the three countermeasures against penetrating radiation, shieldi ng provides the greatest prot ection and is the easiest to use under survival conditions. Therefore, it is the most desirable method. If shielding is not possible, use the other two methods to the maximum extent practical. 23-27. Shielding actually works by absorbing or weakening the penetrating radi ation, thereby reducing the amount of radiation reaching your body. The denser the material, the better the shielding effect. Lead, iron, concrete, and water are good exam ples of shielding materials. Special Medical Aspects 23-28. The presence of fallout material in your area requires slight chan ges in first aid procedures. You must cover all wounds to prevent co ntamination and the entry of radio active particles. You must first wash burns of beta radiation, then tr eat them as ordinary burns. Take extra measures to prevent infection. Your body will be extremely sensitive to infections due to changes in your blood chemistry. Pay close attention to the preventio n of colds or respiratory infections. Rigorously practice personal hygiene to prevent infections. Cover your ey es with improvised goggles to pr event the entry of particles. SHELTER 23-29. As stated earlier, the shield ing material's effectiveness depends on its thickness and density. An ample thickness of shielding material will reduce the level of radiation to negligible amounts. 23-30. The primary reason for finding and building a shelte r is to get protection against the high-intensity radiation levels of early gamma fall out as fast as possible. Five minut es to locate the shelter is a good"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":" 225 guide. Speed in finding shelter is abso lutely essential. Without shelter, the dosage received in the first few hours will exceed that received during the rest of a w eek in a contaminated area. The dosage received in this first week will exceed the dosage accumulated during the rest of a lifetime spent in the same contaminated area. Shielding Materials 23-31. The thickness required to weaken gamma radiation from fallout is far less than that needed to shield against initial gamma radiat ion. Fallout radiation has less energy than a nuclear detonation's initial radiation. For fallout radiation, a re latively small amount of shieldi ng material can provide adequate protection. Figure 23-1 shows the thickness of various materi als needed to reduce residual gamma radiation transmission by 50 percent. Figure 23-1. Materials to Reduce Gamma Radiation 23-32. The principle of half-value layer thickness is useful in understanding the absorption of gamma radiation by various materials. Accord ing to this principle, if 5 centimet ers (2 inches) of brick reduce the gamma radiation level by one-half, adding another 5 centimeters (2 inch es) of brick (another half-value layer) will reduce the intensity by another half, namely, to one-four th the original amount. Fifteen centimeters (6 inches) will reduce gamma radiation fa llout levels to one-eighth its original amount, 20 centimeters (8 inches) to one-sixteen th, and so on. Thus, a shelter prot ected by 1 meter (3 feet) of dirt would reduce a radiation intensity of 1,000 cGy per hour on the outside to about 0.5 cGy per hour inside the shelter. Natural Shelters 23-33. Terrain that provides natural shielding and easy shelter construction is the ideal location for an emergency shelter. Good examples are ditches, ravine s, rocky outcropping, hills, and riverbanks. In level areas without natural protection, dig a fighting position or slit trench. Trenches 23-34. When digging a trench, work from inside the trench as soon as it is large enough to cover part of your body thereby not exposing all your body to radiati on. In open country, try to dig the trench from a prone position, stacking the dirt ca refully and evenly around the trenc h. On level ground, pile the dirt around your body for additional shielding. Depending upon soil conditions, shelter construction time will vary from a few minutes to a fe w hours. If you dig as quickly as possible, you will reduce the dosage you receive."},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":" 226 Other Shelters 23-35. While an underground shelter covered by 1 meter (3 feet) or more of earth provides the best protection against fallout radiation, the following unocc upied structures (in orde r listed) offer the next best protection: • Caves and tunnels covered by more than 1 meter (3 feet) of earth. • Storm or storage cellars. • Culverts. • Basements or cellars of abandoned buildings. • Abandoned buildings made of stone or mud. Roofs 23-36. It is not mandatory that you build a roof on your shelter. Build one only if the materials are readily available with only a brief exposure to outside contamination. If build ing a roof would require extended exposure to penetrating radiat ion, it would be wiser to leave the shelter roofless. A roof's sole function is to reduce radiation from the fallo ut source to your body. Unless you use a thick roof, a roof provides very little shielding. 23-37. You can construct a simple roof from a poncho anchored down with dirt, rocks, or other refuse from your shelter. You can remove large particles of dirt and debris from the top of the poncho by beating it off from the inside at frequent intervals. This cover will not offer shield ing from the radioactive particles deposited on the surface, but it will increase the distance from the fallout source and keep the shelter area from further contamination. Shelter Site Selection and Preparation 23-38. To reduce your exposure time and thereby redu ce the dosage received, remember the following factors when selecting and setting up a shelter: • Where possible, seek a crude, existing shelter th at you can improve. If none is available, dig a trench. • Dig the shelter deep enough to get good protection, then enlarge it as required for comfort. • Cover the top of the fighting position or trench with any readily available material and a thick layer of earth, if you can do so w ithout leaving the shelter. While a roof and camouflage are both desirable, it is probably safer to do without them than to expose yourself to radia tion outside your fighting position. • While building your shelter, keep all parts of your body covered with clothing to protect it against beta burns. • Clean the shelter site of any su rface deposit using a branch or other object that you can discard. Do this cleaning to remove contaminated materi als from the area you will occupy. The cleaned area should extend at least 1.5 meters (5 feet) beyond your shelter's area. • Decontaminate any materials you bring into the she lter. These materials include grass or foliage that you use as insulation or be dding, and your outer clothing (especia lly footgear). If the weather permits and you have heavily contaminated outer clothing, you may want to remove it and bury it under a foot of earth at the end of your shelter. You may retrieve it later (after th e radioactivity decays) when leaving the shelter. If the clot hing is dry, you may decontaminate it by beating or shaking it outside the shelter's entrance to remove the radioac tive dust. You may use any body of"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":" 227 water, even though contaminated, to rid material s of excess fallout particles. Simply dip the material into the water and shake it to get rid of the excess water. Do not wring it out, this action will trap the particles. • If possible and without leaving the shelter, wash your body thoroughl y with soap and water, even if the water on hand may be contaminated. This washing will remove most of the harmful radioactive particles that are likely to cause beta burns or other damage. If water is not available, wipe your face and any other exposed skin surface to remove contaminated dust and dirt. You may wipe your face with a clean piece of cloth or a handful of uncontaminated dirt. You get this uncontaminated dirt by scraping off the top few inches of soil and using the \"clean\" dirt. • Upon completing the shelter, lie down, keep warm, and sleep and re st as much as possible while in the shelter. • When not resting, keep busy by planning future actions, studying your maps, or making the shelter more comfortable and effective. • Don't panic if you experience nausea and symptoms of radiation sickness. Your main danger from radiation sickness is infection. Th ere is no first aid for this sic kness. Resting, drinking fluids, taking any medicine that prevents vomiting, maintaining your food intake, and preventing additional exposure will help avoid infection and aid recovery. Even small doses of radiation can cause these symptoms, which ma y disappear in a short time. Exposure Timetable 23-39. The following timetable provides you with the in formation needed to avoid receiving a serious dosage and still let you cope with survival problems: • Complete isolation from 4 to 6 days following delivery of the last weapon. • A very brief exposure to get water on the third day is permissible, but exposure should not exceed 30 minutes. • One exposure of not more than 30 minutes on the seventh day. • One exposure of not more than 1 hour on the eighth day. • Exposure of 2 to 4 hours from the ninth day through the twelfth day. • Normal operation, followed by rest in a protec ted shelter, from the thirteenth day on. • In all instances, make your exposures as brief as possible. Consider only mandatory requirements as valid reasons for exposure. Decontaminate at every stop. 23-40. The times given above are conser vative. If forced to move after the first or second day, you may do so. Make sure that the exposure is no longer than absolutely necessary. WATER PROCUREMENT 23-41. In a fallout-contaminated area, available water sources may be contaminated. If you wait at least 48 hours before drinking any water to allow radioactive decay to take place and select the safest possible water source, you will greatly reduce the danger of ingesting harmful amounts of radioactivity. 23-42. Although many factors (wind dire ction, rainfall, sediment) will in fluence your choice in selecting water sources, consider the following guidelines. Safest Water Sources"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":" 228 23-43. Water from springs, wells, or other underground sources that undergo natu ral filtration will be your safest sources. Any water found in the pipes or containers of aba ndoned houses or stores will also be free from radioactive particles. This water will be sa fe to drink, although you will have to take precautions against bacteria in the water. 23-44. Snow taken from 15 centimeters (6 inches) or mo re below the surface during the fallout is also a safe source of water. Streams and Rivers 23-45. Water from streams and rivers will be relatively fr ee from fallout within seve ral days after the last nuclear explosion because of dilution. If possible, filter such water before drinking to get rid of radioactive particles. The best filtration method is to dig sediment holes or seepage basins along the side of a water source. The water will se ep laterally into the hole through th e intervening soil that acts as a filtering agent and removes the contaminated fallout pa rticles that settled on the original body of water. This method can remove up to 99 percent of the radioactivity in water. You must cover the hole in some way to prevent furthe r contamination. See Figure 6-9 for an example of a water filter. Standing Water 23-46. Water from lakes, pools, ponds, and other standi ng sources is likely to be heavily contaminated; though most of the heavier, long-lived radioactive is otopes will settle to the bottom. Use the settling technique to purify this water. First, fill a bucke t or other deep container three-fourths full with contaminated water. Then take dirt from a depth of 10 centimeters (4 inches) or more below the ground surface and stir it into the water. Use about 2.5 centimeters (1 inch) of dirt for every 10 centimeters (4 inches) of water. Stir the water until you see most dirt particles suspended in th e water. Let the mixture settle for at least 6 hours. The settlin g dirt particles will carry most of th e suspended fallout particles to the bottom and cover them. You can then dip out the clear water. Purify this water using a filtration device. Additional Precautions 23-47. As an additional precaution against disease, tr eat all water with water purification tablets from your survival kit or boil it. FOOD PROCUREMENT 23-48. Obtaining edible food in a radiation-contamin ated area is a serious but not insurmountable problem. You need to follow a few special procedures in selecting and prepari ng rations and local foods for use. Since secure packaging protects your combat rations, they will be perfectly safe for use. Supplement your rations with any food you can find on trips outside your shelter. Abandoned buildings may have stores of processed f oods. They are safe for use after decontaminating them. Canned and packaged foods should have containers or wrappers removed or washed free of fallout particles. These processed foods al so include food stored in any cl osed container and food stored in protected areas (such as cellars). All such foods must be washed before eating or handling them. 23-49. If little or no processed food is available in your area, you may ha ve to supplement your diet with local food sources. Animals and plants are local food sources."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":" 229 Animals—A Food Source 23-50. Assume that all animals, regardless of their ha bitat or living conditions, we re exposed to radiation. The effects of radiation on animals are similar to those on humans. Thus , most of the wild animals living in a fallout area are likely to become sick or die from radiation during the fi rst month after the nuclear explosion. Although animals may not be free from harmful radioactive ma terials, you can and must use them in survival conditions as a food source if other foods are not avai lable. With careful preparation and by following several important principles , animals can be safe food sources. 23-51. First, do not eat an animal th at appears to be sick. It may ha ve developed a bacterial infection because of radiation poisoning. Cont aminated meat, even if thoroughly cooked, could cause severe illness or death if eaten. 23-52. Carefully skin all animals to prevent any radioa ctive particles on the skin or fur from entering the body. Do not eat meat close to the bones and joints as an animal's skeleton contai ns over 90 percent of the radioactivity. However, the remaining animal muscle tissue will be safe to eat. Before cooking it, cut the meat away from the bone, leaving at least a 3-millim eter (1/8-inch) thickness of meat on the bone. Discard all internal organs (heart, liver, and kidn eys) since they tend to concentrate beta and gamma radioactivity. 23-53. Cook all meat until it is very well done. To be su re the meat is well done, cut it into less than 13- millimeter-thick (4 1/2-inch-thick) pieces before cooking. Such cuts will also reduce cooking time and save fuel. 23-54. The extent of contamination in fish and aquatic animals will be much greater than that of land animals. This is also true for water plants, especia lly in coastal areas. Use a quatic food sources only in conditions of extreme emergency. 23-55. All eggs, even if laid during the period of fallout, will be safe to eat. Completely avoid milk from any animals in a fallout area because animals absorb large amounts of ra dioactivity from the plants they eat. Plants—A Food Source 23-56. Plant contamination occurs by the accumulation of fallout on their outer surfaces or by absorption of radioactive elements through their roots. Your first choice of plant food should be vegetables such as potatoes, turnips, carrots, and other plants whose edible portion grows underg round. These are the safest to eat once you scrub them and remove their skins. 23-57. Second, in order of preference , are those plants with edible parts that you can decontaminate by washing and peeling their outer surf aces. Examples are bananas, apples, tomatoes, prickly pears, and other such fruits and vegetables. 23-58. Any smooth-skinned vegetable, fruit, or pl ant that you cannot easily peel or effectively decontaminate by washing will be your third choice of emergency food. 23-59. The effectiveness of decontam ination by scrubbing is inversely proportional to the roughness of the fruit's surface. Smooth-surfaced fruits will lose 90 percent of their contamination after washing, but rough-surfaced plants will lo se only about 50 percent."},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":" 230 23-60. Eat rough-surfaced plants (such as lettuce) onl y as a last resort beca use you cannot effectively decontaminate them by peeling or washing. Other diffi cult foods to decontaminate by washing with water include dried fruits (figs, prunes, peaches, apricots, pears) and soybeans. 23-61. In general, you can use any plant food that is ready for harvest if you can effectively decontaminate it. However, growing plants can absorb some radioactive material s through their leaves as well as from the soil, especially if rains have occurred during or after the fallout period. Avoid using these plants for food except in an emergency. BIOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENTS 23-62. The use of biological agents is real. Prepare yourself for survival by being proficient in the tasks identified in your soldier's manuals of common task s (SMCTs). Know what to do to protect yourself against these agents. BIOLOGICAL AGENTS AND EFFECTS 23-63. Biological agents are microorga nisms that can cause disease among personnel, animals, or plants. They can also cause the deterioration of material. These agents fall into two broad categories—pathogens (usually called germs) and toxins. Pathogens are living microorganisms that cause lethal or incapacitating diseases. Bacteria, rickettsiae, fungi, and viruses are included in the pa thogens. Toxins are poisons that plants, animals, or microorganisms produce naturally. Possible biological warfare toxins include a variety of neurotoxic (affecting the central nervous syst em) and cytotoxic (causing cell death) compounds. Germs 23-64. Germs are living organisms. So me nations have used them in the past as weapons. Only a few germs can start an infection, especial ly if inhaled into the lungs. Because germs are so small and weigh so little, the wind can spread them over great distances; they can also enter unfiltered or nonairtight places. Buildings and bunkers can trap them, causing a hi gher concentration. Germs do not affect the body immediately. They must multiply inside the body and overcome the body's defenses—a process called the incubation period. Incubation periods vary from seve ral hours to several mont hs, depending on the germ. Most germs must live within another living organi sm (host), such as your body, to survive and grow. Weather conditions such as wind, rain, co ld, and sunlight ra pidly kill germs. 23-65. Some germs can form protective shells, or s pores, to allow survival outside the host. Spore- producing agents are a long-term hazard you must ne utralize by decontaminati ng infected areas or personnel. Fortunately, most live ag ents are not spore producing. These agents must find a host within roughly a day of their delivery or they die. Germ s have three basic routes of entry into your body— through the respiratory tract, through a break in the skin, and through th e digestive tract. Symptoms of infection vary according to the disease. Toxins 23-66. Toxins are substances that plants, animals, or germs produce naturally. These toxins are what actually harm man, not bacteria. An example is botulin, which produces botulism. Modern science has allowed large-scale production of thes e toxins without the use of the ge rm that produces the toxin. Toxins may produce effects similar to those of chemical agents. However, toxi c victims may not respond to first aid measures used against chemical agents. Toxins enter the body in the same manner as germs. However,"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":" 231 some toxins, unlike germs, can penetrate unbroken skin. Symptoms appear almost immediately, since there is no incubation period. Many t oxins are extremely lethal, even in very small doses. Symptoms may include any of the following: • Dizziness. • Mental confusion. • Blurred or double vision. • Numbness or tingling of skin. • Paralysis. • Convulsions. • Rashes or blisters. • Coughing. • Fever. • Aching muscles. • Tiredness. • Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. • Bleeding from body openings. • Blood in urine, stool, or saliva. • Shock. • Death. DETECTION OF BIOLOGICAL AGENTS 23-67. Biological agents are, by natu re, difficult to detect. You cannot detect them by any of the five physical senses. Often, the first sign of a biological agent will be sympto ms of the victims exposed to the agent. Your best chance of detec ting biological agents before they can affect you is to recognize their means of delivery. The three ma in means of delivery are— • Bursting-type munitions. These may be bombs or projecti les whose burst causes very little damage. The burst will produce a small cloud of liqui d or powder in the immediate impact area. This cloud will disperse eventu ally; the rate of dispersion depends on terrain and weather conditions. • Spray tanks or generators. Aircraft, vehicle spray tanks, or ground-level aero sol generators produce an aerosol cloud of biological agents. • Vectors. Insects such as mosquitoes, fl eas, lice, and ticks deliver pat hogens. Large infestations of these insects may indicate the use of biological agents. 23-68. Sign of a possible biological attack are the presence of unus ual substances on the ground or vegetation, or sick -looking plants, crops, or animals. INFLUENCE OF WEATHER AND TERRAIN 23-69. Your knowledge of how weather and terrain aff ect the agents can help you avoid contamination by biological agents. Major weather factors that affect biological agents are sunlight, wind, and precipitation. Aerosol sprays will tend to concentrate in low ar eas of terrain, similar to early morning mist. 23-70. Sunlight contains visible and ultraviolet solar radiation that rapidly kills most germs used as biological agents. However, natural or man-made c over may protect some agents from sunlight. Other man-made mutant strains of germ s may be resistant to sunlight."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":" 232 23-71. High wind speeds increase the dispersion of bi ological agents, dilute their concentration, and dehydrate them. The further downwind the agent travels, the less effec tive it becomes due to dilution and death of the pathogens. However, the downwind hazard area of the biological agent is significant and you cannot ignore it. 23-72. Precipitation in the form of moderate to heavy ra in tends to wash biologica l agents out of the air, reducing downwind hazard areas. However, the agents may still be very effective where they were deposited on the ground. PROTECTION AGAINST BIOLOGICAL AGENTS 23-73. While you must maintain a healthy respect for biological agents, ther e is no reason for you to panic. You can reduce your suscep tibility to biological agents by maintaining current immunizations, avoiding contaminated areas, and c ontrolling rodents and pests. You must also use proper first aid measures in the treatment of wounds, and only safe or properly decontaminated sources of food and water. You must ensure that you get enough sleep to prevent a run-down conditi on. You must always use proper field sanitation procedures. 23-74. Assuming you do not have a protective mask, always try to keep your face covered with some type of cloth to protect yourself agains t biological agent aerosols. Dust ma y contain biological agents; wear some type of mask when dust is in the air. 23-75. Your uniform and gloves will protect you against bites from vect ors (mosquitoes and ticks) that carry diseases. Completely button y our clothing and tuck your trousers tightly into your boots. Wear a chemical protective overgarment, if available, as it provides better protecti on than normal clothing. Covering your skin will also reduce the chance of th e agent entering your body thr ough cuts or scratches. Always practice high standards of pe rsonal hygiene and sanitation to help prevent the spread of vectors. 23-76. Bathe with soap and water whenever possible. Us e germicidal soap, if available. Wash your hair and body thoroughly. Clean under your fingernails. Clean teeth, gums, tongue, and the roof of your mouth frequently. Wash your clothing in hot, soapy water if you can. If you cannot wash your clothing, lay it out in an area of bright sunlight and allow the light to kill the microorganisms. After a toxin attack, decontaminate yourself as if for a chemical attack us ing the M258A2 kit (if availa ble) or by washing with soap and water. SHELTER 23-77. You can build expedient shelters under biol ogical contamination conditions using the same techniques described in Chapter 5 . However, you must make slight changes to reduce the chance of biological contamination. Do not bu ild your shelter in depressions in the ground. Aerosol sprays tend to concentrate in these depressions. Avoid building y our shelter in areas of vegetation, as vegetation provides shade and some degree of protection to biol ogical agents. Avoid using vegetation in constructing your shelter. Place your shelter's en trance at a 90-degree angle to the prevailing winds. Such placement will limit the entry of airborne agents and prevent ai r stagnation in your shelter. Always keep your shelter clean. WATER PROCUREMENT"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":" 233 23-78. Water procurement under biological conditions is difficult but not impossible. Whenever possible, try to use water that has been in a sealed containe r. You can assume that the water inside the sealed container is not contaminated. Wash the water contai ner thoroughly with soap and water or boil it for at least 10 minutes before breaking the seal. 23-79. If water in sealed containers is not available, your next choice, only under emergency conditions , is water from springs. Again, boil the water for at least 10 minutes before drinking. Keep the water covered while boiling to prevent contaminati on by airborne pathogens. Your last choice, only in an extreme emergency , is to use standing water. Vectors and ge rms can survive easily in stagnant water. Boil this water as long as practicable to kill all orga nisms. Filter this water th rough a cloth to remove the dead vectors. Use water purif ication tablets in all cases. FOOD PROCUREMENT 23-80. Food procurement, like water procurement, is not impossible, but y ou must take special precautions. Your combat rations are sealed, and you can assume they ar e not contaminated. You can also assume that sealed containers or packages of processed food are safe. To ensure safety, decontaminate all food containers by washing with soap and water or by boiling the container in water for 10 minutes. 23-81. You should consider supplementing your rati ons with local plants or animals only in extreme emergencies. No matter what you do to prepare the f ood, there is no guarantee that cooking will kill all the biological agents. Use local food only in life-o r-death situations. Rememb er, you can survive for a long time without food, especially if the food you eat may kill you! 23-82. If you must use local food, select only healthy-looking plants and animals. Do not select known carriers of vectors such as rats or other vermin. Select and prepare plants as you would in radioactive areas. Prepare animals as you do plants. Always use gloves and protective clothing when handling animals or plants. Cook all plant and animal food by boiling only. Boil all food for at least 10 minutes to kill all pathogens. Do not try to fry, bake, or roas t local food. There is no guarantee that all infected portions have reached the required temperatur e to kill all pathogens. Do not eat raw food. CHEMICAL ENVIRONMENTS 23-83. Chemical agent warfare is real. It can create extreme problems in a survival situation, but you can overcome the problems with the proper equipment, know ledge, and training. In a survival situation, your first line of defense against chemical agents is yo ur proficiency in individu al NBC training, to include donning and wearing the protective ma sk and overgarment, personal d econtamination, recognition of chemical agent symptoms, and individual first aid fo r chemical agent contamination. The SMCTs cover these subjects. If you are not proficient in these skills, you will have little chance of surviving a chemical environment. 23-84. The subject matter covered below is not a substi tute for any of the individual tasks in which you must be proficient. The SMCTs address the various chem ical agents, their effects, and first aid for these agents. The following information is provided under th e assumption that you are pr oficient in the use of chemical protective equipment and know the symptoms of various chemical agents. DETECTION OF CHEMICAL AGENTS"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":" 234 23-85. The best method for detecting chemical agents is the use of a chemical agen t detector. If you have one, use it. However, in a survival situation, you will most likely have to rely solely on the use of all of your physical senses. You must be alert and able to detect any clues indicating the use of chemical warfare. General indicators of th e presence of chemical agents are tears, difficult breathing, choking, itching, coughing, and dizziness. With agents that are very hard to detect, you must watch for symptoms in other personnel. Your surroundings will provide valuab le clues to the presence of chemical agents; for example, dead animals, sick people, or people and animals displaying abnormal behavior. 23-86. Your sense of smell may alert you to some chemical agents, but most will be odorless. The odor of newly cut grass or hay may indica te the presence of choking agents. A smell of almonds may indicate blood agents. 23-87. Sight will help you detect chemical agents. Most chemical agents in the solid or liquid state have some color. In the vapor state, you can see some chemical agents as a mist or thin fog immediately after the bomb or shell bursts. By observing for symptoms in others and by observing delivery means, you may be able to have some warning of chemical agents. Mustard gas in the liquid state will appear as oily patches on leaves or on buildings. 23-88. The sound of enemy munitions will give some clue to the presence of chemical weapons. Muffled shell or bomb detonations are a good indicator. 23-89. Irritation in the nose or eyes or on the skin is an urgent warning to protect your body from chemical agents. Additionally, a strange taste in food, water, or cigarettes may serve as a warning that they have been contaminated. PROTECTION AGAINST CHEMICAL AGENTS 23-90. In a survival situation, always perform the followi ng steps, in the order list ed, to protect yourself from a chemical attack: • Use protective equipment. • Give quick and correct self -aid when contaminated. • Avoid areas where chemical agents exist. • Decontaminate your equipment and body as soon as possible. 23-91. Your protective mask and overgarment are the ke y to your survival. Without these, you stand very little chance of survival. You must take care of these items and prot ect them from damage. You must practice and know correct self-aid procedures before exposure to ch emical agents. The detection of chemical agents and the avoidance of contaminated areas are extremely importa nt to your survival. Use whatever detection kits may be availa ble to help in detection. Since you are in a survival situation, avoid contaminated areas at all costs. You can expect no help should you become contaminated. If you do become contaminated, decontaminate yourself as soon as possible us ing proper procedures. SHELTER 23-92. If you find yourself in a contaminated area, try to move out of the area as fast as possible. Travel crosswind or upwind to reduce the time spent in th e downwind hazard area. If you cannot leave the area immediately and have to build a shelter, use normal shelter constructi on techniques, with a few changes. Build the shelter in a clearing, away from all vegetation. Remove all topso il in the area of the shelter to"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":" 235 decontaminate the area. Keep the sh elter's entrance closed and orient ed at a 90-degree angle to the prevailing wind. Do not build a fire using contamin ated wood; the smoke will be toxic. Use extreme caution when entering your shelter so that you will not bring contamination inside. WATER PROCUREMENT 23-93. As with biological and nuclear environments, getting water in a ch emical environment is difficult. Obviously, water in sealed containers is your best and safest source. Y ou must protect this water as much as possible. Be sure to decontamin ate the containers before opening. 23-94. If you cannot get water in sealed containers, tr y to get it from a closed source such as underground water pipes. You may use rainwate r or snow if there is no eviden ce of contamination. Use water from slow-moving streams, if necessary, but always check fi rst for signs of contamination, and always filter the water as described under nuclear conditions. Signs of water source contamination are foreign odors such as garlic, mustard, geranium, or bitter almonds; oily spots on the surface of the water or nearby; and the presence of dead fish or animals. If these signs are present, do not use the water. Always boil or purify the water to prevent bacteriological infection. FOOD PROCUREMENT 23-95. It is extremely difficult to eat while in a contaminated area. You will have to break the seal on your protective mask to eat. If you eat, find an area in wh ich you can safely unmask. The safest source of food is your sealed combat rations. Food in sealed cans or bottles will also be safe. Decontaminate all sealed food containers before opening, ot herwise you will contaminate the food. 23-96. If you must supplement your combat ra tions with local plants or animals, do not use plants from contaminated areas or animals that appear to be sick. When handling plants or animals, always use protective gloves and clothing. Appendix A Survival Kits The Army has several basic survival kits, primarily for issue to aviators. There are kits for cold climates, hot climates, and overwater. There is also an individual survival kit with a general packet and medical packet. The cold, hot, and overwater kits are in canvas carrying bags. Th ese kits are normally stowed in the helicopter's cargo and passenger area. An aviator's survival vest (SRU-21P), worn by he licopter crews, also contains survival items. U.S. Army aviators flying fixed- wing aircraft equipped with ejection seats use the SRFU-31/P survival vest. The individual survival kits are stowed in the seat pan. Like all othe r kits, the rigid seat survival kit (RSSK) you use depends on the environment. Items contained in the kits may be ordered separately through supply channels.

Appendix E Venomous Snakes and Lizards If you fear snakes, it is probably because you are unfamiliar with them or you have wrong information about them. There is no need fo r you to fear snakes if you know—"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":" 342 • Their habits. • How to identify the dangerous kinds. • Precautions to take to prevent snakebite. • What actions to take in case of snakebite ( Chapter 3 ). For a man wearing shoes and trousers and living in a camp, the danger of being bitten by a venomous snake is small compared to th e hazards of malaria, cholera, dysentery, or other diseases. Nearly all snakes avoid man if possible. A few—the king cobra of Southeast Asia, the bushmaster and tropical rattlesnake of South America, and the mamb a of Africa—may aggressively attack man, but even these snakes do so only occasionally. Most snak es get out of the way and are seldom seen. WAYS TO AVOID SNAKEBITE E-1. Snakes are widely distribute d. They are found in all tropical , subtropical, and most temperate regions. Some species of snakes have specialized glands that contain a to xic venom, and long, hollow fangs to inject their venom. E-2. Although venomous snakes use their venom to secu re food, they also use it for self-defense. Human accidents occur when you don't see or hear the snake, when you step on them, or when you walk too close to them. E-3. Follow these simple rules to reduce the chance of accidental snakebite: • Don't sleep next to brush, tall grass, large bou lders, or trees. They pr ovide hiding places for snakes. Place your sleeping bag in a clearing. Use mosquito netting tucked well under the bag. This netting should provide a good barrier. • Don't put your hands into dark places, such as ro ck crevices, heavy brush, or hollow logs, without first investigating. • Don't step over a fallen tree. Step on the log and l ook to see if there is a sn ake resting on the other side. • Don't walk through heavy brush or tall grass without looking down. Look where you are walking. • Don't pick up any snake unless you are ab solutely positive it is not venomous. • Don't pick up freshly killed snakes without firs t severing the head. The ne rvous system may still be active and a dead snake can deliver a bite. SNAKE GROUPS E-4. Snakes dangerous to man usually fall into tw o groups: proteroglypha and solenoglypha. Their fangs and their venom best desc ribe these two groups ( Figure E-1 ). Figure E-1. Snake Group Characteristics FANGS"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":" 343 E-5. The proteroglypha have, in fr ont of the upper jaw and preceding the ordinary teeth, permanently erect fangs. These fangs are called fixed fangs. E-6. The solenoglypha have erectile fa ngs; that is, fangs they can raise to an erect position. These fangs are called folded fangs. VENOM E-7. The fixed-fang snakes (proteroglypha) usually have neurotoxic venoms. These venoms affect the nervous system, making the victim unable to breathe. E-8. The folded-fang snakes (solenoglypha) usually have hemotoxic venoms. These venoms affect the circulatory system, destroying bl ood cells, damaging skin tissues, and causing internal hemorrhaging. E-9. Remember, however, that most venomous snakes have both neurotoxic and hemotoxic venom. Usually one type of venom in the snake is dominant and the other is weak. VENOMOUS VERSUS NONVENOMOUS SNAKES E-10. No single characteristic distinguishes a venomous snake from a harmless one except the presence of poison fangs and glands. Only in dead specimens can you determine the presence of these fangs and glands without danger. DESCRIPTIONS OF VENOMOUS SNAKES E-11. There are many different venomous snakes th roughout the world. It is unlikely you will see many except in a zoo. This manual describes only a few veno mous snakes. However, you should be able to spot a venomous snake if you— • Learn about the two groups of snakes and the families in which they fall ( Figures E-2 ). • Examine the pictures and read the desc riptions of snakes in this appendix.

Snake Families (Continued)"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":" 345 VIPERIDAE E-12. The viperidae, or true vipers, usually have th ick bodies and heads that ar e much wider than their necks ( Figure E-4 ). However, there are many differen t sizes, markings, and colorations. Figure E-4. Positive Iden tification of Vipers E-13. This snake group has develope d a highly sophisticated means fo r delivering venom. They have long, hollow fangs that perform like hypodermic needles. They deliver their venom deep into the wound. E-14. The fangs of this group of snakes are movable. Th ese snakes fold their fangs into the roof of their mouths. When they strike, their fangs come forw ard, stabbing the victim. The snake controls the movement of its fangs; fang movement is not automatic. The venom is usually hemotoxic. However, there are several species that have larg e quantities of neurotoxic elemen ts, thus making them even more dangerous. The vipers are responsible for many human fatalities around the world. CROTALIDAE E-15. The crotalids, or pit vipers ( Figure E-5 ), may be either slender or thick-bodied. Their heads are usually much wider than their necks. These snakes ta ke their name from the d eep pit located between the eye and the nostril. They are usually brown with dark blotches but some kinds are green. Figure E-5 Positive Identi fication of Pit Vipers E-16. Rattlesnakes, copperheads, cott onmouths, and several species of da ngerous snakes from Central and South America, Asia, China, and India fall into the pit viper group. The pit is a highly sensitive organ"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":" 346 capable of picking up the slightest temperature variance. Most pit vipe rs are nocturnal. They hunt for food at night with the aid of these specialized pits that le t them locate prey in total darkness. Rattlesnakes are the only pit vipers that possess a rattle at the tip of the tail. E-17. India has about twelve species of these snakes. You find them in trees or on the ground in all types of terrain. The tree snakes are slender; the ground snakes are heavy-bodied. All are dangerous. E-18. China has a pit viper similar to the cottonmout h found in North America. You find it in the rocky areas of the remote mountains of South China. It reaches a length of 1.4 meters (5 feet) but is not vicious unless irritated. You can also find a small pit viper, about 45 centimeters (18 inches) long, on the plains of eastern China. It is too small to be dangerous to a man wearing shoes. E-19. There are about twenty-seven speci es of rattlesnakes in the United States and Mexico. They vary in color and may or may not have spots or blotches. So me are small but others, such as the diamondbacks, may grow to 2.5 meters (8 feet) long. E-20. There are five kinds of rattlesnakes in Centra l and South America, but onl y the tropical rattlesnake is widely distributed. The rattle on the tip of the tail is sufficient identification for a rattlesnake. E-21. Most will try to escape without a fight when approached, but there is always a chance one will strike at a passerby. They do not always give a warning; they may strike first and rattle afterwards or not at all. E-22. The genus Trimeresurus is a subgroup of the crotalidae. Th ese are Asian pit vipers. They are normally tree-loving snakes, but some live on the ground. They basically have the same characteristics of the crotalidae—slender build and very dangerous. Th eir bites usually are on the upper extremities—head, neck, and shoulders. Their venom is largely hemotoxic. ELAPIDAE E-23. Elapidae are a group of highly dangerous snakes with a powerful neurotoxic venom that affects the nervous system, causing respiratory paralysis. Included in this family are coral snakes, cobras, mambas, and all the Australian venomous snakes. The coral sn ake is small and has caused human fatalities. The Australian death adder, tiger, ta ipan, and king brown snakes are among the most venomous in the world, causing many human fatalities. E-24. Only by examining a dead snake can you positively determine if it is a cobr a or a near relative (Figure E-6 ). On cobras, kraits, and coral snakes, the third scale on the up per lip touches both the nostril scale and the eye. The krait also has a row of enlarged scales down its ridged back."},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":" 347 Figure E-6. Positive Identification of Cobras, Kraits,and Coral Snakes E-25. You can find the cobras of Afri ca and the Near East in almost a ny habitat. One kind may live in or near water, another in trees. Some are aggressive and savage. The distan ce a cobra can strike in a forward direction is equal to the distan ce its head is raised above the ground. Some cobras, however, can spit venom a distance of 3 to 3.5 meters (10 to 12 feet). This venom is harmless unless it gets into your eyes; then it may cause blindness if not washed out immediately. Poking ar ound in holes and rock piles is dangerous because of the chance of encountering a spitting cobra. LATICAUDIDAE AND HYDROPHIDAE E-26. A subfamily of elapidae, these snakes are specialized in that they found a better environment in the oceans. Why they are in the oceans is not clear to scientists. E-27. Sea snakes differ in appearance from other snak es in that they have an oarlike tail to aid in swimming. Some species of sea nakes have venom several times more toxic than the cobra's. Because of their marine environment, sea snakes seldom come in contact with humans. The exceptions are fisherman who capture these dangerous snakes in fishnets and scuba divers who sw im in waters where sea snakes are found. E-28. There are many species of sea snakes. They vary gr eatly in color and shape. Their scales distinguish them from eels that have no scales. E-29. Sea snakes occur in salt water along the coasts throughout the Pacifi c. There are also sea snakes on the east coast of Africa and in the Persian Gulf. There are no sea snakes in the Atlantic Ocean. E-30. There is no need to fear sea snakes. They have not been known to attack a man swimming. Fishermen occasionally get bitten by a sea snak e caught in a net. The bite is dangerous. COLUBRIDAE E-31. The colubridae is the largest gr oup of snakes worldwide. In this family there are species that are rear-fanged; however, most are co mpletely harmless to man. They have a venom-producing gland and enlarged, grooved rear fangs that allow venom to fl ow into the wound.

However, the bo omslang and the twig snake of Africa have caused human deaths. LIZARDS E-32. There is little to fear from lizards as l ong as you follow the same precautions as for avoiding snakebite. There are only two poisonous lizards: the Gila monster and the Mexican beaded lizard. The venom of both these lizards is neurotoxic. The two lizards are in the same family, and both are slow moving with a docile nature. E-33. The komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis), although not poisonous, can be dangerous due to its large size. These lizards can reach lengths of 3 meters (10 feet) and we igh over 115 kilograms (253 pounds). Do not try to capture this lizard.

Therefore, it is wise to know which ones are dangerous, what the dangers of the various fish are, what precautions to take, and what to do if you are injured by one of these fish. Fish and mollusks will present a danger in one of three ways—by attacking and biting you, by injecting toxic venom into you through venomous spines or tentacles, and through eating fish or mollusks whose flesh is toxic. The danger of actually encountering one of these dangerous fish is relatively small, but it is still significant. Any one of these fish can kill you. Avoid them if at all possible. FISH THAT ATTACK MAN F-1. The shark is usually the first fish that comes to mind when considering fish that attack man. Other fish also fall in this category, such as the barracuda, the moray eel, and the piranha. SHARKS F-2. Sharks are potentially the most dangerous fish that attack people. The obvious danger of sharks is that they are capable of seriously maiming or killing you with their bite. Of the many shark species, only a relative few are dangerous. Most ca ses of shark attacks on humans ar e by the white, tiger, hammerhead, and blue sharks. There are also records of attacks by ground, gray nurse, and mako sharks. Figure F-1 , shows various sharks and their sizes."},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":" 421 Figure F-1. Sharks F-3. Avoid sharks if at all possible. Follow the procedures discussed in Chapter 16 to defend yourself against a shark attack. F-4. Sharks vary in size, but there is no relationship between the size of the shark and likelihood of attack. Even the smaller sharks can be dangerous, especi ally when they are traveling in schools. F-5. If bitten by a shark, the most important measure for you to take is to stop the bleeding quickly. Blood in the water will attract more sharks. Get yourself or the victim into a raft or to shore as soon as possible. If in the water, form a circle around the victim (i f not alone), and stop the bl eeding with a tourniquet. OTHER FEROCIOUS FISH F-6. In saltwater, other ferocious fish incl ude the barracuda, sea bass, and moray eel ( Figure F-2 ). The sea bass is usually an open water fish. It is dangerous due to its large size. It can re move large pieces of flesh from a human. Barracudas and moray eels have been known to attack man and inf lict vicious bites. Be careful of these two species when ne ar reefs and in shallow water. Mo ray eels are very aggressive when disturbed."},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":" 422 Figure F-2. Ferocious Fish F-7. In fresh water, piranha are the only significantly dangerous fish. They are inhabitants of the tropics and are restricted to northern South America. These fish are fairly sma ll, about 25 to 60 centimeters (10 to 24 inches), but they have very larg e teeth and travel in large schools. They can devour a full-grown hog in minutes. VENOMOUS FISH AND INVERTEBRATES F-8. There are several species of veno mous fish and invertebrates, all of which live in saltwater. All of these are capable of injecting poison ous venom through spines located in their fins, tentacles, or bites. Their venoms cause intense pain and are potentially fatal. If injured by one of the following fish or invertebrates, treat the in jury as for snakebite. Stingray Dasyatidae species Stingrays inhabit shallow water, especially in the tr opics, but in temperate regions as well. All have a distinctive ray shape, but colo ration may make them hard to spot unless they are swimming. The venomous, barbed spines in their tail s can cause severe or fatal injury.

Stonefish Synanceja species Stonefish are found in the tropical waters of th e Pacific and Indian oceans. Averaging about 30 centimeters (12 inches) in length, their subdued colors and lumpy shape provide them with exceptional camouflage. When stepped on, the fins in the dorsal sp ine inflict an extremely painful and sometimes fatal wound.

Toadfish Batrachoididae species Toadfish are found in the tropical waters off the coas ts of South and Central America. They are between 17.5 and 25 centimeters (7 to 10 inches) long and ha ve a dull color and large mouths. They bury themselves in the sand and may be easily stepped on. They have very sharp, extremely poisonous spines on the dorsal fin (back). Weever fish Trachinidae species The weever fish is a tropical fish that is fairly slim and about 30 cen timeters (12 inches) long. All its fins have venomous spines that cause a painful wound.

It is grayish-white with iridescent blue ringlike markings. This octopus usually will not bite unless stepped on or handled. Its bite is extremely poisonous and frequently lethal. Portuguese man-of-war Physalis species Although it resembles a jellyfish, the Portuguese man-of-w ar is actually a colony of sea animals. Mainly found in tropical regions; however, the Gulf stream current can carry it as far as Europe. It is also found as far south as Australia. The floating portion of th e man-of-war may be as small as 15 centimeters (6 inches), but the tentacles can reach 12 meters (40 f eet) in length. These tentacles inflict a painful and incapacitating sting, but it is rarely fatal.

They live under rocks, in cr evices and coral reefs, and along ro cky shores and protected bays in tropical areas. All have tiny teeth that are similar to hypodermic needle s. They can inject an extremely poisonous venom that acts very swiftly, causing acute pain, swelling, paralysis, blindness, and possible death within hours. Avoid handling all cone shells. Terebra shells Terebridae species These shells are found in both temper ate and tropical waters. They are si milar to cone shells but much thinner and longer. They poison in the same way as cone shells, but their venom is not as poisonous. FISH WITH TOXIC FLESH F-9. There are no simple rules to tell edib le fish from those with poisonous flesh. Figure 8-2 shows the most common toxic fish. All of these fish contain vari ous types of poisonous substances or toxins in their flesh and are dangerous to eat. They have the following common characteristics: • Most live in shallow wa ter around reefs or lagoons. • Many have boxy or round bodies with hard shell- like skins covered with bony plates or spines. They have small parrotlike mouths, small gills, and small or absent belly fins. Their names suggest their shape. F-10. In addition to the above fish and their characteristics, barracuda and red snapper fish may carry ciguatera, a toxin that accumulates in the system s of fish that feed on tropical marine reefs."},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":" 428 F-11. Without specific local informa tion, take the following precautions: • Be very careful with fish taken from normally shallow lagoons with sandy or broken coral bottoms. Reef-feeding species predom inate and some may be poisonous. • Avoid poisonous fish on the leeward side of an island. This area of shallow water consists of patches of living corals mixed with open spaces and may extend seaward for some distance. Many different types of fish, some pois onous, inhabit these shallow waters. • Do not eat fish caught in any area where the water is unnaturally discolored. The discoloration may be indicative of plankton that cause various types of toxicity in plankton-feeding fish. • Try fishing on the windward side or in deep passages leading from the open sea to the lagoon, but be careful of currents and waves. Live coral r eefs drop off sharply into deep water and form a dividing line between the suspected fish of the shallows and the desirable deep-water species . Deepwater fish are usually not poisonous. You can catch the various toxic fish even in deep water. Discard all suspected reef fish, whether caught on the ocean or the reef side. Appendix G Ropes and Knots TERMINOLOGY G-1. To be able to construct she lters, traps and snares, weapons and tools, and other devices; you should have a basic knowledge of ropes and knots and some of the terminology used with them. The terms are as follows: • Bight . A simple bend of rope in which the rope does not cross itself. • Dressing the knot . The orientation of all knot parts so that they are prop erly aligned, straightened, or bundled. Neglecting this can result in an addi tional 50 percent reduction in knot strength. This term is sometimes used for setting the knot which involves tightening all part s of the knot so they bind on one another and make th e knot operational. A loosely tied knot can easily deform under strain and change, becoming a slipknot or worse, untying. • Fraps . A means of tightening the lashings by loop ing the rope perpendicularly around the wraps that hold the spars or sticks together. • Lashings . A means of using wraps and fraps to tie two or three spars or stic ks together to form solid corners or to construct tripods. Lashings begin a nd end with clove hitches. • Lay . The lay of the rope is the same as the twist of the rope. • Loop . A loop is formed by crossing the running end ove r or under the standing end to form a ring or circle in the rope. • Pig tail . That part of the running end th at is left after tying the knot. It should be no more than 4 inches long to conserve rope and prevent interference. • Running end . The free or working end of a rope. This is the part of the rope you are actually using to tie the knot. • Standing end . The static part of rope or rest of the rope besides the running end. • Turn . A loop around an object such as a post, rail, or ring with the running end continuing in the opposite direction to the standing end. A round turn continues to ci rcle and exits in the same general direction as the standing end. • Whipping . Any method of preventing the end of a r ope from untwisting or becoming unwound. It is done by wrapping the end tightly with a small cord, tape or other means. It should be done on"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":" 429 both sides of an anticipated cut in a rope, before cutting the rope in two. This prevents the rope from immediately untwisting. • Wraps (Figure G-1 ). Simple wraps of rope around two poles or sticks (square lashing) or three poles or sticks (tripod lashing). Wraps begin and e nd with clove hitches and get tighter with fraps. All together, they form a lashing. Figure G-1. Wraps BASIC KNOTS G-2. The basic knots and methods of tying them that you should know for your survival are as follows: • Half-hitch. This is the simplest of all knots and used to be the safety, or finishing, knot for all Army knots. Because it had a tendency to undo itsel f without load, it has since been replaced by the overhand. • Overhand ( Figure G-2 ) . This is the simple knot that most pe ople tie everyday as the first half of tying their shoes. It can also be used to temporarily whip th e end of a rope. This knot should replace the half-hitch as a finishing knot for ot her knots. This knot alone will reduce the strength of a straight rope by 55 percent. Figure G-2. Overhand Knot • Square (Figure G-3 ) . A good, simple knot for general purpose use. This knot is basically two overhand knots that are reversed, as in Right over Left, Left over Right. It is used to tie the ends of"},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":" 430 two ropes of equal diameter toge ther (just like your shoe laces) and must be secured with an overhand on both ends. It is easy to inspect, as it forms two loops a nd is easy to untie after being loaded. • Round turn and two half-hitches ( Figure G-4 ) . This is the main anchor knot for one-rope bridges and other applications when a good anchor knot is required and where high loads would make other knots jam and difficult to untie. It is mo st used to anchor rope to a pole or tree. Figure G-3. Square Knot Secured by Overhand Knots Figure G-4. Round Turn and Two Half-Hitches • Clove hitch and end-of-the-line clove hitch (Figures G-5 and G-6 ). It can be used to fasten a rope to a tree or pipe and also puts little strain on the rope. It is an easy anc hor knot but tension must remain on the knot or it will slip. This can be remedied by making another loop around the object and under the center of the clove hitch. Figure G-5. Clove Hitch"},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":" 431 Figure G-6. End-of-the-Line Clove Hitch • Sheep shank ( Figure G-7 ) . A method of shortening a rope, it may also be used to take the load off of a weak spot in the rope. It is a temporary knot unless the eyes are fasten ed to the standing part of the rope on both ends. Figure G-7. Sheep Shank • Double sheet bend (Figure G-8 ). This knot is used to tie together the ends of two ropes of equal or unequal diameter. It will also join wet rope and not slip or draw tight under load. It can be used to tie the ends of several ropes to the end of one r ope. When a single rope is tied to multiple ropes, the bight is formed with the multiple of ropes. Figure G-8. Double Sheet Bend • Prusik (Figures G-9 through G-11 ). This knot ties a short rope around a longer rope (for example, a sling rope around a climbi ng rope) in such a manner that the short rope will slide on the climbing rope if no tension is applied, and will hold if tensi on is applied on the short rope. This knot can be tied with an end of rope or bight of rope. When tied with an end of rope, the knot is finished off with a bowline. The nonslip nature of the knot on another rope allo ws climbing of ropes with foot holds. It can also be used to an chor ropes or the end of a tracti on splint on a branch or ski pole."},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":" 432 Figure G-9. Prusik, End of Line Figure G-10. Prusik, End of Line and Center of Line Figure G-11. Prusik, End of Line With Bowline for Safety • Bowline and bowline finished with an overhand knot (Figure G-12 ). Around-the-body bowline was the basic knot used for rescue for many years as it provided a loop, which could be placed around the body, that would not slip nor tighten up under strain. It has been replaced by the figure 8 in most applications as the figure 8 does not weaken the rope as much. Figure G-12. Bowline and Bowline Finished With an Overhand Knot"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":" 433 • Figure 8 and retraceable figure 8 (Figure G-13 ). This knot is the main re scue knot in use today. It has the advantage of being stronger than the bow line and is easier to tie and check. Its one disadvantage is that when wet, it may be more difficult to untie than the bowline after being stressed. The figure 8 (or figure-of-e ight) can be used as an anchor knot on fixed ropes. It can also be used to prevent the end of a rope from sli pping through a fastening or loop in another rope when a knot larger than an overhand knot is needed. Figure G-13. Figure 8 and Retraceable Figure 8 VARIOUS CONSTRUCTION LASHINGS G-3. There are numerous items that require lashings for construction. Figures G-14 through G-16 show types of lashings that you can use when cons tructing tripods, shelters , and racks. Refer to paragraphs 12- 25 and 12-26 if using field-expedient rope. Figure G-14.
