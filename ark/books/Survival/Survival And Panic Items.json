Y Y F Things You Might Need In A Crisis and Things That W ill Disappear In A Panic This list has been compiled from several lists and boards (some of the date from the Y2K Panic) and I' ve sorted it by what I think are the priorities. Y ou may disagree which is why I presented this list in an editable format. A s with all things, use common sense and adapt this list to you and your family's needs. Also, you may need to adjust the list for local and seasonal conditions. The Bug Out Kit and Long Term Columns are a way to group these ite ms so you know whether you can store them away or p ut them where you can grab them readily. The key is: Y - Yes  N - No  F - Food - Store it where it's safe and you can use it as you cycle out your food stores - you will want to take as much food as you can in a bug out situa tion M - Maybe - it depends upon you where you live, what your specific plans are like whether you're bugging out to go to somewhere else permanently or you're leaving for a few days as with a storm evacuation, flood, etc........
