With many other survival-planning resources emphasizing that approach, urban dwellers that plan to stay put in the city, no matter the circumstanc- es, have been overlooked. Not only do 58 percent of Americans live in cities, but certain risks are higher in cities than elsewhere. Urban Emergency Sur vival Plan delivers a common-sense approach to urban survival planning rather than advocating that city survivalists need to fi gure out a way to grow an acre of food, raise goats, and build an underground bunker. The clearly outlined approach here will help you to reduce the risks inherent in disasters that occur in well-populated areas. Inside you’ll fi nd: • packing lists for get-home bags, everyday carry items for adults and kids and bug-out bags • an overview of threats that face an urban area and instructions for planning safe travel during and after disasters, as well as how to plan a temporary escape • instructions for sheltering in place at work • chapters on food storage and water procurement in urban areas with empha- sis on limited space and budget • a detailed chapter on security options in urban areas • a detailed chapter on sanitation, fi rst aid and shelter • ideas for how to respond and cooperate with government disaster plans • photos of important survival gear Discover the skills you’ll need to weather any storm, whether you live in an apartment, townhouse, condominium, single-family home or any other urban setting. With planning and practice, you’ll gain the confi dence to always feel safe in the city.

The electrical grid in many urban areas is antiquated at best, and it doesn’t take much for portions of it to go down, sometimes on a regular basis and often without apparent cause. Other systems, such as those con- trolling water and sewer, can be just as fraught with problems. Yet, at the same time, cities are where we conduct business and where we have fun. Where else other than a large city can you possibly pick up Chinese food at three in the morning? Where else can you visit a museum, stop at a park, and then end the day at a Broadway show? Much of the literature related to disaster preparedness, if it addresses urban concerns at all, focuses on convincing people to move away from the cities. While this isn’t the worst idea in the world, for many people that just isn’t a feasible option. The city is where they were born and that’s where they’ve chosen to live their lives. That’s where they work and where they play. When I set out to write this book, my goal was, and still is, to give urban residents the knowledge they need to combat the threats they will face in the wake of a disaster. There are certain risks that are higher in cities than elsewhere, such as a large population competing for limited resources. There are also spe- cifi c challenges, such as the lack of space to grow the majority of your own food. Despite these challenges and risks, all is not lost for the ur- ban prepper, no matter what many books, websites, and blog- 6 001-008_U9037_FM.indd 6 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"gers may say. Where there’s a will, there’s a way. Preppers are a unique breed of people. They are independent and often stub- born. They’ve made up their minds to do something and, by God, they are going to do it, no matter what. City preppers share that mindset with their country cousins. Despite being told time and again that cities are no place you want to be if disaster hits, they’ve decided to stay the course, come what may. That’s where this book comes in. Rather than tell urban preppers they need to fi gure out a way to grow an acre of food, raise goats, and build an underground bunker, I’ve tried to im- part some common-sense approaches to urban prepping. There is a fair amount of discussion on the subject of bugging out, but that’s a necessary part of any disaster preparedness plan no mat- ter where you live. The fact is, people have been living in cities for thousands of years. During all those years, countless disasters have struck those urban areas. Everything from volcanic eruptions to war, terrorist attacks to earthquakes. Time and again, urban resi- dents have come out on the other side, perhaps a bit battered but none the worse for wear. Human beings are fairly resilient creatures, after all. It is my most sincere hope that everything you read in this book remains nothing more than an intellectual exercise for you. If you never have to truly rely on the knowledge contained between these covers, I’ll be a happy guy. Few people hope and pray for major disasters. Even if you manage to avoid any truly catastrophic events, odds are pretty good you’ll experience pow- er outages, severe weather, and other short-term emergencies at one point or another. Within this book, you’ll learn how to store food and water for emergencies, with a focus on doing so in a limited space and with a limited budget. We’ll talk about health and sanitation, which are critical areas particularly in urban settings.

That’s sort of like plan- ning a trip without fi rst choosing a fi nal destination. Sure, you can have a great time just road tripping and seeing the sights, but you might just end up lost. With that in mind, let us begin our journey into urban preparedness by discussing some of the common threats we face. SEVERE WEATHER No matter where you live or decide to move, Mother Nature will have at least one or two ways to make life interesting. Winter Storms Throughout the world, there are numerous regions that experi- ence exceptionally cold temperatures and heavy snowfall during winter. Some of these areas measure single snowfalls in feet (me- ters) rather than inches (centimeters). In February 2013, Winter Storm Nemo dumped more than two feet of snow on parts of New England and surrounding areas. With hurricane-force wind gusts, this was a very severe storm. Winter Storm Nemo is an example of the type of storm 9 009-022_U9037_01.indd 9 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"commonly referred to as a nor’easter. Several hundreds of thou- sands of people lost power during the storm, and it took several days for power to be restored to all in the affected area, both residences as well as businesses. Roads quickly become treacher- ous and in some areas completely impassable. There were sev- eral fatalities reported, with many deaths attributed to travel ac- cidents as well as exertion from people attempting to clear snow. Fortunately, we typically have at least a little warning be- fore storms like this hit. In fact, due to advances in meteorologi- cal science and related technology, forecasters can often predict these storms several days in advance. By paying attention to these forecasts, you should have plenty of time to top off your supplies and avoid the last minute rush at the stores. Hurricanes and Tropical Storms Hurricanes are extremely powerful storms with sustained winds in excess of 74 mph. In the western hemisphere they often origi- nate in the Gulf of Mexico or off the Atlantic coastline. These storms are called typhoons when they occur in the Pacifi c or Indian oceans. Hurricane Andrew hit Florida in August 1992, and was the costliest disaster ever to hit the state. Well over 700,000 homes were damaged or destroyed and more than one million people lost power. In the aftermath of the hurricane, there were wide- spread reports of looting from businesses, with news footage showing armed shop owners guarding their stores. Almost a dozen insurance companies went bankrupt due to the massive costs of reimbursing the insured residents. Of course, no discussion of hurricanes would be complete without mentioning Hurricane Katrina. Even with all of the technology at our disposal and all the warnings that were re- peated over and over to residents, more than 1,800 people lost their lives. Few would argue that mistakes were made by offi - cials and civilians alike in the way the storm and the aftermath 10 009-022_U9037_01.indd 10 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"were handled. While we’d hope lessons were learned and will be heeded in the future, the largest opportunity for learning might be that people need to rely on themselves fi rst, rather than rely- ing on government and/or private agencies that are likely to be overloaded with requests for assistance. Hurricanes and tropical storms don’t strike without warn- ing. These storms are often observed and reported several days if not a week or more in advance of landfall. Acting on these re- ports early will give you ample time to make the proper prepara- tions, such as securing your home and evacuating to a safer area. Tsunamis Tsunamis, or tidal waves, can strike any coastal area. The trig- gers for tsunamis include underwater earthquakes or volcanic eruptions as well as landslides. A tsunami is a series of massive waves. Unlike normal ocean waves, they don’t “break” but in- stead appear as a rapidly rising tide. How rapidly? Go online and do some searching for news footage from the tsunami that hit Japan in 2011. It took just minutes for the wave to fl ood towns to such a degree that homes were almost completely underwater.

In times of heavy rain, rivers can rise above the banks and spread into nearby towns and cities. After the rain stops, it can take days for the water to recede, leaving devastation behind. When it comes to traveling in fl ooded areas, even a mere 6 inch- es (15cm) of water can sweep you off your feet. Tornadoes Tornadoes are, unfortunately, a very common occurrence in the Midwest region of the United States, particularly in the area of- ten referred to as “Tornado Alley,” which generally refers the area of northern Texas through Kansas and Oklahoma. While this designation is not offi cial, it has become a recognized col- loquial term. The costliest tornado in United States history hit Joplin, Missouri, in May 2011. It was rated as an EF5 tornado, the most severe rating on the Enhanced Fujita scale, with winds in excess of 200 mph (322 kmh) About 160 people were killed as a result of the tornado. Roughly 25 percent of the city was destroyed. Several thousand homes were fl attened or otherwise severely damaged. One of the problems with tornadoes is the lack of warn- ing time before they strike. Often, there are mere minutes be- tween the time when a tornado siren is sounded and when the actual funnel cloud hits the area. In May 2013, a tornado struck Weather Alerts Severe weather rarely strikes without at least some advance warning. You might consider adding a weather app to your phone or at least investing in a battery- powered weather alert radio. Both of these technologies utilize information from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to alert you to potentially hazardous conditions. These are excellent resources to have available, particularly during power outages. 12 009-022_U9037_01.indd 12 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Moore, Oklahoma, killing several people as well as causing massive damage. Residents there had less than fourteen minutes from the time the warning sounded until impact. Heat Wave In urban areas in particular, heat waves can be a severe prob- lem. Excessively high temperatures that continue over a period of several days or weeks put a considerable strain on the electri- cal grid. Residents crank up their air conditioners in hopes of fi nding relief from the heat. Brownouts and rolling blackouts become common during heat waves. The heat also puts a strain on the human body, causing serious health threats to both the young and the old. Adequate rest is a necessity of the human body. Heat waves of- ten affect sleep patterns as it can be very diffi cult to be comfortable when the temperatures don’t cool off appreciably at night. This lack of rest leads to feeling worn out and agitated, which in turn can result in an increase in violent acts among the city’s populace.

While often thought of as being a warm weather threat, a drought can occur at any time of year and in any climate. A drought has both short-term and long-term impacts. Water usage may be restricted due to falling levels in natural wa- ter supplies. Food prices can rise as a result of crop failures. In 2011, the southwestern region of the United States expe- rienced the most severe drought since the 1930s Dust Bowl era. Coupled with the lack of precipitation was a massive heat wave, with temperatures rising into the triple digits for about forty consecutive days. Food prices escalated quickly and the number of wildfi res increased. Lakes and rivers dried up and residents in some areas faced water restrictions. Record high temperatures plus restrictions on water is not a great combination. This particular threat highlights the need for having a stockpile of stored water. Wildfires Every year, from spring through autumn, fi res break out along the West Coast of the United States and are driven by strong Santa Ana or Diablo winds. These wildfi res cause mas- sive amounts of damage as well as threaten the lives of thou- sands of residents. Wildfi res are often at least partially a result of drought conditions. While residents in these areas may be warned ahead of time when conditions are becoming ideal for wildfi res, there are many causes for the fi res themselves. A care- lessly extinguished campfi re or a lit cigarette tossed from a car may spark a fi re that destroys thousands of acres and threatens hundreds of lives. Part of the danger of wildfi res stems from their speed. De- pending upon the terrain, they can spread as quickly as 12 to 14 mph. The fi re can even jump ahead of itself, with embers taken aloft by high winds and dropped into dry grass farther away. 14 009-022_U9037_01.indd 14 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Earthquakes As the recent quakes in Japan and Haiti show, earthquakes strike without warning and can cause massive losses of life and property. Earthquakes happen along fault lines, which is where oceanic or continental plates meet. On January 17, 1994, an earthquake hit Northridge, California. The magnitude of the quake was offi cially measured at a magnitude of 6.7, with an extremely high ground acceleration being felt as far away as Reno, Nevada, some two hundred miles away. With a duration of only about ten to twenty seconds, this earthquake averaged about one billion dollars in damage per second. Almost sixty people were killed as a direct result of the earthquake and over eight thousand injured. Unfortunately, there is typically little to no warning before an earthquake occurs. Volcanoes Volcanoes are weak spots in the Earth’s crust that allow gases and lava to rise to the surface. When they erupt, they can cause tremendous amounts of damage. On May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens erupted violently, sending ash and smoke fi fteen miles into the air. In the two months prior to the eruption, there were many signs of imminent disaster. Several earthquakes had be- gun fracturing the north face of the mountain, with the pressure from steam inside causing the face to bulge. Authorities closed the area to the public, which likely saved thousands of lives. As it was, though, fi fty-seven people were killed as a result of the eruption and the total cost of the clean up was estimated at 1.1 billion dollars. Underneath the famous Yellowstone National Park in Wyo- ming lies a supervolcano. When it last erupted approximately 640,000 years ago, scientists estimate roughly 240 cubic miles of ash, dirt, and debris was sent into the atmosphere. Many of these same scientists believe it is not a matter of if it will erupt again, but rather a matter of when . 15 009-022_U9037_01.indd 15 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"ELECTRICAL GRID COLLAPSE Power outages often accompany severe weather. In fact, electric- ity is usually the fi rst thing to go when the weather turns violent. In many urban areas, the power grid is antiquated at best and as a result is somewhat fragile. A typical outage lasts a day or so and isn’t usually that much of a hardship, though inconvenient and frustrating. However, if the outage extends into a couple days or more, urban dwellers may see some signifi cant issues begin to crop up. Many, if not most, urban residents rely on electricity for heat and cooking. Not to mention, the night can get pretty dark without electric lights. In urban areas in particular, this can lead to signifi cant security concerns. Solar Flares Solar fl ares may sound like something out of science fi ction, but they can have a very real effect here on earth. In September 1859, a powerful solar fl are caused a geomagnetic solar storm. This solar storm resulted in a spectacular light show across many parts of the planet. Typically, only those residing in north- ern regions of the world see aurorae; however, in this case the phenomena was seen as far south as Cuba and Hawaii. The bad news, though, was the event also caused major problems with electrical systems, as primitive as they were by today’s standards. Telegraph systems in particular went haywire, in some cases de- livering shocks to operators as well as starting fi res. British as- tronomer Richard C. Carrington was among the fi rst people to observe and report the solar storm, and it was named the Car- rington Event in his honor. If such a fl are or storm to hit today, it is theorized the impact could be catastrophic to the power grid. Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Another threat to the electrical grid is an electromagnetic pulse (EMP). Discovered during nuclear weapon testing in the 1940s, 16 009-022_U9037_01.indd 16 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"an EMP is a result of nuclear detonation. Without getting into the complicated physics, an EMP is essentially a fast pulse of electromagnetic radiation that causes rapid changes in the electrical and magnetic fi elds in the affected area. The result is current and voltage surges that disable unprotected devices. In short, an EMP will basically overload the electrical grid in the area and ruin the items running on electricity as well. Think of EMPs like this—let’s say there was a huge on/off switch that controlled everything running on electricity. An EMP effectively turns that switch off, somewhat permanently. Today there are devices that could be manufactured to pro- duce an EMP without the nuclear explosion. While the risk of terrorists getting their hands on one might be remote, it is not impossible. Should an EMP be set off at the correct altitude over the central United States, it could effectively wipe out much of the power grid from coast to coast. TERRORISM On September 11, 2001, terrorists hijacked four airliners. Two of them crashed into the World Trade Center in New York City, one crashed into the Pentagon, and the fi nal plane diverted from its intended target, Washington, D.C., and was forced to crash in Shanksville, Pennsylvania by passengers who fought against the terrorists on board. Almost three thousand people died as a result of these attacks. While much of the world had felt the ef- fects of terrorism for decades, these attacks brought this threat to America’s shores. Terrorism works by spreading fear and chaos. The bomb- ings at the Boston Marathon in April 2013 is a prime example of this. Three people were killed and 180 were injured in the blasts. The subsequent manhunt to fi nd the bombers effectively shut down the city of Boston, with residents being told to remain at home and to lock their doors. While in most areas this was not a mandatory order, the majority of the residents followed instruc- 17 009-022_U9037_01.indd 17 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"tions. The entire city was brought to a screeching halt. Residents were unable to get to work or even to an open grocery store to pick up a gallon of milk. Terrorism isn’t limited to violent, physical attacks. Cyberter- rorism brings different threats, but is potentially no less dead- ly than bombings. For example, in 2009 it was reported that Chinese and Russian computer hackers had managed to break into various urban infrastructure computer programs and insert programming that could be activated at a later date. Had these hacks not been detected, they could have affected systems such as water, sewage, and power grids. EPIDEMIC Due to the close proximity in which people live and work in an urban area, disease can spread much more rapidly in cities than in rural areas. From 1918 to 1920, a particularly deadly form of infl uenza killed about 75 million people across the globe, infecting more than 500 million. In addition to those whose Wreckage caused by a terrorist attack Four Oaks © Shutterstock.com 18 009-022_U9037_01.indd 18 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"health was directly affected, fears about exposure and infection caused communities to effectively shut down. Stores closed up and hospitals were well over capacity while trying to operate on skeleton crews. While medical breakthroughs coupled with improvements in public sanitation have had a positive impact on reducing the number of epidemics, disease remains a distinct threat. In 2009, a similar infl uenza outbreak occurred, killing more than 18,000 people worldwide. Part of the problem is how rapidly the fl u virus can mutate, rendering the current vaccine all but useless. Even with our modern vaccinations, around forty thousand people in the United States die every year just from the common fl u. SUPPLY SHORTAGES There are several different reasons why your grocery store may suddenly not have enough stock on hand to satisfy your needs. There are many links in the supply chain and a problem with any one of them can cause the chain to break. Truck drivers go- ing on strike, weather issues, problems with the suppliers—any one of these events can result in shortages being observed on store shelves. Once upon a time, stores had large stockrooms in back, where they stored goods to replenish the shelves as needed. However, about ten years ago or so, something called Just in Time (JIT) inventory systems began to rise in popularity. The idea is that by reducing the size of the stockrooms, stores can increase the actual selling space within the building. So, stores were remodeled and the stockrooms were drastically reduced. At the same time, com- puter programs were installed to keep much better track of the merchandise in the stores. These inventory programs track sales and automatically order from the warehouse enough widgets to fi ll the shelf every week. The merchandise comes off the truck and goes immediately out to the sales fl oor. It’s a great concept that makes perfect business sense. 19 009-022_U9037_01.indd 19 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"The wrench in the works, though, is when there is a sudden increase in sales, such as just before a major storm. It doesn’t take long at all for the average grocery to run out of bread, milk, and other basic commodities. When that happens, it could be a couple days before the next shipment, provided the trucks aren’t delayed by the very storm that caused the run in the fi rst place. CIVIL UNREST Any time there is a large-scale disaster, quite often one of the end results is civil unrest in the cities. When small segments of the population perceive that established laws are unenforceable, chaos rears its ugly head. Looting, riots, and just general bad behavior become the rule rather than the exception. Sometimes it isn’t a catastrophe that causes the riots, rather the riot is the catastrophe. Case in point—Los Angeles, Califor- nia, April 1992. After the acquittal of four offi cers accused of excessive force and assault against Rodney King, racially moti- vated riots broke out in several areas of L.A. It took several days for authorities to get things back under control. More than fi fty people were killed and a couple thousand were injured.

Wilding Related to riots is a fairly new form of civil unrest called wilding . This is the term used to describe small bands of people, typically teenagers and young adults, who rampage through an area of a city, stealing from stores and physically assaulting anyone in their way. In 2011, the opening day of the Wisconsin State Fair in Mil- waukee, Wisconsin, saw an example of this. Groups of youths, predominantly males, rampaged through the midway, breaking into fi ghts with other groups and, after leaving the fairgrounds, assaulting other fairgoers in the area. Around the same time, though not that day, there were reports of convenience stores be- ing robbed by groups of young adults who swarmed the stores en masse, grabbing what they wanted and just walking out the door.

States and counties were encouraged to develop emergency response plans and federal funds were made avail- able for doing so. As a result, there are now plans on fi le with county agencies from coast to coast. Generally speaking, the disaster plans created by govern- ment entities are a matter of public record. By examining them, we can put ourselves ahead of the game. If we know in advance what various government agencies plan to do in the event of a crisis, we can adjust our own plans accordingly. WHAT SORT OF GOVERNMENT RESPONSE CAN WE EXPECT DURING OR AFTER A DISASTER? As you might expect, local government agencies are typically the fi rst to respond to a disaster. Fire and rescue teams, as well as po- lice and sheriff’s departments, are the fi rst on the scene. They do what they can to help the injured, secure the scene, put out fi res, and clear debris. This level of response is usually suffi cient for small emergencies, such as house fi res or localized storm damage. However, even when adding in aid from neighboring towns, these 23 023-032_U9037_02.indd 23 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"departments can become overwhelmed and require further assis- tance. Not to mention, there are times when a disaster is spread over a region to such a degree that there is no mutual aid to re- quest because everyone is busy with their own end of things. State-level agencies can be called in for these more wide- spread emergencies. This includes the National Guard. Their goal is to assist the local agencies in whatever manner they can. While there may occasionally be some jostling as to who is effec- tively in command of the disaster recovery, generally speaking these agencies work well in conjunction with the locals. Moving another step up the chain, the state governor can request federal aid. This assistance will come from FEMA (Fed- eral Emergency Management Agency), which is a division of the Department of Homeland Security. At this stage, FEMA can provide shelter, food, water, and other supplies, as well as per- sonnel to help with the mitigation phase of disaster recovery. The federal government can also provide fi nancial assistance to individuals and businesses. LIMITATIONS TO GOVERNMENT AID AND RESPONSE With all that assistance available, some people wonder why they should plan to provide for their own safety and needs in an emergency. Many plan to just sit tight and wait for help to arrive. This is fl awed thinking for several reasons. First, it takes time for any assistance to arrive. FEMA and other agencies estimate it could take as long as three full days for support to be put into place. When you’re cold, tired, and hun- gry, three days is a darn long time to wait for help. To be honest, if we look at recent disasters such as Hurricane Katrina, three days is a rather generous estimate. There were people in New Orleans waiting quite a bit longer than just seventy-two hours. Second, there is only so much aid to go around. Supplies are not infi nite. Trucks can only carry so much food and water at a time. Depending on the nature of the disaster and the number 24 023-032_U9037_02.indd 24 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"of people in need, they may very well run out of supplies before they get to you, which will increase the amount of time you’ll have to wait for a blanket and a bottle of water. Third, and in my opinion perhaps most important, I believe it is the duty of everyone to do their fair share when it comes to disaster preparedness. Few of us lack the ability to stock up on even small amounts of food, water, and other supplies. I look at it like this—if there is a major snowstorm happening, every single person who ends up stranded on the road puts at least one or two other people in danger by having to come rescue them. Always strive to be part of the solution rather than adding to the problem. There are people out there who will truly need the sup- port of the various responding agencies. Let the aid go to where it is truly necessary. ARE THERE NON-GOVERNMENT AGENCIES THAT ALSO RESPOND TO DISASTERS? There are a number of civilian groups and organizations that frequently get involved with disaster response. One of the most important of these is the ARRL (American Radio Relay League). These great folks are involved with amateur (ham) radio and donate their time as well as their equipment to help with com- munications between other responding agencies, both govern- ment and civilian. The Salvation Army also frequently steps in to provide food, water, shelter, and other necessities that have been donated to the cause. The American Red Cross is probably one of the best known of these relief agencies. Often among the very fi rst to arrive after a disaster strikes, they will not only help provide basic needs but refer disaster victims to government agencies for long-term assistance. In addition to these well-known national agencies, there are innumerable local groups, such as those affi liated with churches, which will often step in and lend a hand. 25 023-032_U9037_02.indd 25 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"WHERE CAN I FIND MY LOCAL GOVERNMENT DISASTER PLANS? At the minimum, every county in the United States has an emer- gency management department. It may go by slightly different names—emergency management and disaster response are two of the more common names used. In many counties, this falls under the purview of the county sheriff’s department, so I’d sug- gest you start your search there. You can go online and search for your county name along with the term emergency manage- ment and that should get you pointed in the right direction. Fol- lowing that, call the non-emergency number for your county sheriff’s department and ask them how you can get in touch with the county’s emergency management coordinator. Larger cities often have their own emergency management departments as well. This may be a function of the police de- partment but is sometimes a joint effort between city hall and law enforcement. Again, go online and search your city’s name along with emergency management and you should fi nd it. What am I likely to find in these disaster plans? While the information may not be disaster-specifi c, the plans should fi rst give you an indication of how much, or how little, the powers-that-be have thought about the various types of di- sasters likely to befall your area. That information will be found in the risk assessment section of the plans. Reviewing that mate- rial will help you understand the most likely threats. Proceeding from there, you are probably going to fi nd infor- mation on which governmental agencies will be responsible for certain actions. For example, vehicular traffi c may be stopped in certain areas or diverted to specifi c routes, with this being en- forced by the police department. The health or human services department may be tasked with setting up emergency shelters, clinics, or distributing food and water. Often, this will be done in conjunction with an aid agency like the American Red Cross. 26 023-032_U9037_02.indd 26 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Government Response in Disaster By Charley Hogwood As we prepare for disasters, we must keep in mind that regardless of how bad the situation, there will always be some form of authority. If you have a clear under- standing of how that authority operates you will know what to expect and how to react. First of all, you must understand how the system is designed to work. Agen- cies operate on the principle that all emergencies are handled at the local level fi rst and expanded as needed. For example, you wouldn’t expect FEMA to respond to a house fi re. The emergency response system is a connected fl ow of support based on the Incident Command System (ICS). As an incident becomes too large to handle, more assets are systematically sent in to gain control. Too often, we hear stories of citizens complaining that FEMA took days to arrive and take control. FEMA is only a coordinating agency, providing support when requested through presidential declaration. In a nutshell, here is how it works. When an event strikes, local authorities become overwhelmed and state assistance is requested. If state resources are not suffi cient to deal with the crisis, the governor requests a disaster declaration from the president. If approved, FEMA responds by sending support from various agencies suited to the event. As you can see, the system needs time to activate. Each increasing level of support cannot happen without an offi cial request from the level of government below. In a major disaster event, personnel groups called Strike Teams are deployed to gather information on which areas need help and what type of help they need. We must understand that when lines are down and roads are blocked the survey times may be severely delayed. Until the pieces are in place, and even then for some time afterward, you are on your own. The average responder to citizen-to-fi rst-responder ratio is ap- proximately 1,000 citizens to every 1 fi rst responder. All responders will be on emergency duty in a severe event. Medical services will be very busy evacuating patients, law enforcement will be performing security operations, and utilities will be surveying and clearing debris for travel and recovery. Often, law enforcement combines into groups for assistance and projection of power, which further re- duces the number of individual eyes on the street until assistance arrives. Another thing to note is that local responders may be victims of the disaster themselves and not available to respond to calls for assistance. The citizen caught in an event should expect to experience restricted travel in and out of the affected area. Often, people are away from their homes when disaster strikes and are unable to return due to roadblocks. Roadblocks are not always 27 023-032_U9037_02.indd 27 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Why would this information be beneficial to me when creating my own disaster plans? You can use the government plans as a reference when making your own. For example, if you know ahead of time that in the offi cial—panic travel, evacuation and debris will hamper movement. It is not uncommon for people to be prevented from returning home for extended periods of time. Once the restrictions are eased you will need proof of residency or a very good reason to be there. If the event is of a heath nature, such as contagion, the standard operating procedure of the authorities is to contain, or in other words, quarantine. In this case, everyone will be required to shelter in place as long as it takes and all travel will be suspended in affected areas. After a perimeter is estab- lished, law enforcement will begin to move about the affected areas and interact with residents. Their mission, at this point, is the health and welfare of the people. If they feel someone is at risk, that person may be evacuated or detained and/or have any threats, such as weapons, removed from their possession. What does this mean for you in a disaster situation? Chances are you’ll be without any real substantive assistance for at least several days post disaster, so three full days’ worth of supplies is a bare minimum when it comes to planning. After some of the hurricanes here in Florida, neighborhoods were without power for several weeks. How would your supplies hold up? Immediately after an event, you are on your own for the most part, unless you planned for such an event by forming a Mutual Assistance Group (MAG). A MAG is a group of people posi- tioned in such a way as to provide support to each other in a crisis. In your hazard planning you would be wise to seek out those around and nearby you who are assets to your family and also be aware of those around you who may be hazards to your family. Remember that with low supplies and high tensions, it’s always best to be proactive rather than reactive. Charley Hogwood is the Chief Instructor for P.R.E.P.

Bridges being closed as well as reversing traffi c fl ow are also possibilities. This information will prove to be invaluable as you create your evacuation plans. Further, if you happen to live along or near an area likely to be affected by some sort of planned closure, these plans will give you a heads up that you may want to get out ahead of the crowd, if at all possible. What other things might be noted in the government emergency plans? You may fi nd information relating to door-to-door searches. These will ostensibly be conducted for the purpose of ensuring the safety of residents. The idea is to make contact with every person who has remained in their home after the disaster struck, making sure they are uninjured, not trapped, and essentially do- ing OK. The downside of such searches is that if authorities fi nd massive quantities of supplies, they may deem it necessary to confi scate and redistribute them to those in need. Depending upon the agency and their own protocols, you may also encounter tagging of houses and properties after disas- ter strikes. As homes are searched, the search party will use paint to mark the house, either on the front door or the garage door. This mark is often a large X, with coded information around it. For example, the symbol may tell other searchers that the home has been searched twice, no survivors found, no evidence of con- tamination (in the event of some sort of health crisis, like an epidemic). It would be wise to look for such information in the applicable government disaster plans and make note of what the different symbols mean. This way, should you fi nd yourself visit- ing a neighboring home in the area and see the large X, you’ll know what’s going on before you knock on the door. 29 023-032_U9037_02.indd 29 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"You may also want to make note of the location of planned emergency shelters in your immediate area. Should your own plans fail for some reason, it would be great to know in advance where you can go for help and shelter. If you are a pet owner, be forewarned that many if not all government-run emergency shelters will not allow pets, or at least will restrict the admission of pets to those small enough to be kept in a cage or portable kennel and, of course, with proper vaccination records. Are there other resources available to help better understand gov- ernmental responses to disasters? FEMA, through its Emergency Management Institute, provides almost two hundred independent study courses, all online and all completely free of charge. Many of these courses would be of great interest and value as you make your own plans. You can fi nd more information on this program by visiting http:// training.fema.gov/is/. PREPARING FOR A STAY IN AN EMERGENCY SHELTER Despite the best of precautions, you may fi nd yourself needing to spend a night or more in an emergency shelter. This shelter could be one set up by a government agency such as FEMA, a private organization like the Red Cross, or perhaps even a local church. No matter who is running the shelter, there are several things you’ll fi nd in common. Many shelters are essentially single room affairs, with rows of cots set up in a gymnasium. In the immediate aftermath of a disaster, supplies and amenities in an emergency shelter will be between slim and none. The focus will be primarily on provid- ing a roof over people’s heads, some food and water, possibly basic fi rst aid. Due to the large numbers of people likely to be occupying the shelter, there will be little to no privacy nor any realistic means of securing valuables. Even the most effi ciently run shel- 30 023-032_U9037_02.indd 30 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"ters will be loud and chaotic. Some shelters may allow small pets, which will certainly add to the cacophony. Assuming the utilities at the shelter haven’t been affected by the disaster, there will most likely be working bathrooms. However, if you think sharing one bathroom with a teenager is nerve-wracking, try sharing maybe four bathroom stalls and sinks with several dozen strangers. Because of the extremely limited space, as well as the se- curity issues, you shouldn’t show up at a shelter with a ton of stuff in tow. Think more along the lines of what you’d need for a night or two at a hotel. This might include: • extra clothes, enough for a day or two • basic toiletries (soap, toothbrush, deodorant, etc.) • identifi cation • snacks and bottled water • entertainment items (deck of cards, paperback book, etc.) • any necessary prescription medications As I noted earlier, some shelters may allow small pets. How- ever, the shelter offi cials will almost certainly require proof of immunizations for the animals. They will also require the ani- mals to be restrained at all times, typically in a cage or pet car- rier. This is for the animals’ safety as well as the shelter residents. If you plan on bringing your pet with you to a shelter, you should plan ahead by calling local agencies and verifying whether they will allow pets in the shelters they will set up after a disaster. You should bring with you a copy of the pet’s immunization record, license if applicable, a muzzle, and a leash. There are a few things you should absolutely not bring with you to a shelter. Most shelters will not allow weapons. If you are found armed, you will be asked to either relinquish the weapon or leave the shelter. Same thing goes with alcohol or illegal drugs. Spending a night or two in an emergency shelter is preferable to ending up on the street, but you should still do everything in your power to avoid this last resort. 31 023-032_U9037_02.indd 31 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"WHAT ABOUT MARTIAL LAW? There are widespread so-called conspiracy theories that center on the idea that martial law could be imposed locally, regionally, or even nationally in the event of a major catastrophe. Leaving those aside and concentrating on the basic facts, martial law is when the military is placed in charge of an area. Generally speaking, military representatives and agencies take on the roles currently fi lled by civilian authorities. Martial law often involves curfews and travel restrictions. Certain areas of a city may be closed off, with the residents evac- uated (willingly or otherwise) to a safer location. Travel may be restricted to daytime hours only. Quite often, these restrictions are put in place at least partially to reduce or eliminate looting and other crimes. A declaration of martial law can also involve a suspension of at least some of what we consider our civil liberties or civil rights. Here in the United States, we are to be free of unreason- able searches and seizures. However, during martial law, we may be subjected to them without much in the way of recourse. With all that in mind, if a declaration of martial law occurs, you probably don’t want to hang around too long. If you have a means of evacuating the area, I’d encourage you to do so. In chapter eight, we will discuss evacuating the home (bugging out) after a disaster. SUMMARY Government agencies will almost certainly jump into action to assist city residents affected by disaster. However, their resourc- es and capabilities are limited. Further, they are just as subject to making mistakes as anyone else. By researching the disaster plans already in place, you can use that information in your own planning, bearing in mind that for all the good intentions these agencies and organizations have, you very likely will be on your own for some time after a disaster strikes. 32 023-032_U9037_02.indd 32 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREE MAKING EMERGENCY PLANS It is often said that preppers and survivalists are all about the “doom and gloom,” but the reality is that they are planning for the future, a future they are convinced will unfold after a disaster strikes. That, my friend, is optimistic thinking, not be- ing a doomsayer. Devising emergency plans is the bulk of what being prepared is all about. We make plans, test them out, tweak them, and keep practicing until we’re confi dent in our abilities to handle whatever life might decide to throw our way. While making plans can be a lot of work, it will all be worth it should you someday need to implement them following a real emer- gency. There is a saying you’ve probably heard before— proper prior planning prevents poor performance. In this chapter, we will cover four different emergency plans: • Sheltering in place at home • Sheltering in place at work • Getting home • Evacuating from home While some of these plans may not apply to your individual situation, I encourage you to read through them anyway as you may have a need to adapt one of them to meet a unique set of circumstances in your life. 33 033-049_U9037_03.indd 33 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"EMERGENCY PLANNING BASICS Emergency plans should be unique to each individual and/or family, specifi cally tailored to meet your needs. However, there are a few general principles that are common to all plans. Planning Is a Team Effort Ideally, everyone who will be affected by the plan will be in- volved in creating the plan—Mom, Dad, the kids, even Uncle Jesse, if he lives with you. Granted, your average four-year-old probably isn’t going to be of great help in this planning process, but older children should defi nitely be a part of the conversa- tions. In fact, many teenagers today have some great ideas when it comes to disaster readiness. Blame it on the popularity of zom- bie movies or dystopian quasi-romance novels, kids today often give at least semi-serious thought as to what they’d do in the face of a disaster. Communication Is Key Planning for communication is a key element of any disaster plan. While we live in a day and age where we routinely chat with people all across the globe using handheld devices, it is important to realize the use of those devices hinges upon their ability to function properly. If any element of the equation is taken away, such as power for the device, the transmission sig- nal reaching the satellite, or the signal reaching the other device, the system falls apart. Plan ahead for backup means of communication. For start- ers, each family member should carry a wallet card or some oth- er list of important phone numbers. If the cell phone runs out of juice, you won’t be able to access the contacts list. Should you need to call a family member, knowing they are number six on your speed-dial isn’t going to be of much help. Timed Check-Ins. It is also wise, as part of your written di- saster plans, to set up a specifi c time interval for calls home or to 34 033-049_U9037_03.indd 34 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"other family members. What this does is help prevent unneces- sary worry on the part of folks at home as they anxiously wonder when you’ll be calling. If the plan says you will call every hour, or every half hour, they know when to expect the phone to ring. They can spend the time in between listening to news broadcasts or otherwise trying to gather information to help those family members who are away from home. This sort of arrangement is also good for preserving the battery in the cell phone. You can turn the phone off when not in use, confi dent that family mem- bers know you won’t be calling for another hour. As has been found time and again during and immediately following disasters, cell phone towers can quickly become over- whelmed. While you might see four full bars of signal strength on your phone, there may be so many people trying to make calls at the same time that few of the calls actually get through. Worth noting is the fact that text messages will often still get Split Families In today’s day and age, with just about half of all marriages ending in divorce, many children experience shared custody arrangements between the parents. This can lead to some challenges when it comes to disaster planning, particularly if only one of the parents is on board. As uncomfortable as it may be, a conversa- tion needs to happen between the parents. Assuming you are the parent who is concerned about disaster planning, I would encourage you to not go overboard with any sort of scare tactics. Simply state that you are in the process of putting together plans for what to do if disaster were to strike, such as a major power out- age or some sort of weather event. One of the most important things to decide is who will pick up the kids from school if an emergency strikes during the school day. We will cover this in detail later in this chapter when we talk about making plans for getting home. When deciding where the children should go following a disaster, safety comes fi rst and it will likely make sense for the children to go to the home of the “prepper parent.” An emergency is not the time to break out the calendar and start arguing about who had the kids last weekend and who canceled at the last minute two weeks ago. 35 033-049_U9037_03.indd 35 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"through during those times, as they are routed through a dif- ferent system. If you can’t get a voice call to go through, try texting. This is something to keep in mind when it comes to communicating with children who may be stranded at school. While school rules often forbid the use of cell phones during class time, in an emergency I doubt many teachers are going to be handing out detentions to the kids who are trying to get in touch with parents. Communication Tree. A communication tree is also advisable. Put in very simple terms, you assign a person to be the start of the tree and they call two people on the list. Each of those people call two people, and so on down the line. This system has been around for quite a long time and it works very well for spread- ing information quickly. Radio Communication. Because cell phones and even land- lines have limitations, it’s a good idea to have a back-up means of communication. There are, of course, many different types FRS radios: one example of the hundreds of different two-way radios available on the market today 36 033-049_U9037_03.indd 36 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"of two-way radios on the market today. These work on either Family Radio Service (FRS) frequencies, General Mobile Ra- dio Service (GMRS) frequencies, or dual mode models that can transmit on either set of frequencies. These devices don’t often work very well in urban areas, due to interference. The radios generally work on line-of-sight, meaning the more obstructions between the transmitting and receiving radios, the worse the re- ception will be. While they are certainly a step up from the old G.I. Joe walkie-talkies you may have played with as a child, they certainly are not nearly as good as the package may claim. Portable CB radios are an option, particularly for within a vehicle. However, the range isn’t going to be very far without a very powerful transmitter. A couple of miles is about average for range. Amateur radio, commonly referred to as ham radio, is defi - nitely worth considering. It does require a license to transmit, but the cost is minimal. Ham operators have a long history of assisting with communications during disasters. Not to men- tion, I have yet to meet a ham who won’t bend over backwards to help someone who is genuinely interested in the hobby. However you set it up, everyone involved with the disaster planning needs to be on the same page with regards to com- munications. Who is going to contact whom and how will such contact happen? Use a Prepping Binder to Organize Your Plans You don’t need to write out every single step of each of your emergency plans. However, it certainly isn’t a bad idea to at least have an outline for each plan, hitting the high points so mem- bers of your family or group can reference it if needed. But, avoid including any information that could be a security risk. This would include things like the street addresses of your bug- out locations and where in the home someone would fi nd your fi rearms or other valuables. For the bug-out locations (BOL), 37 033-049_U9037_03.indd 37 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"consider utilizing some sort of codes, such as referring to them as BOL A, BOL B, BOL C, and so on.

Of course, there are about as many different ways to go about assembling one as there are preppers doing it. However, there are some ready-made products available that can be of great assistance. I personally like and recommend the Preparedness Planner (arewecrazyorwhat.net). Consisting of over eighty pag- es, this downloadable PDF document gives both beginning and experienced preppers all sorts of forms and checklists to keep them focused and organized. It sells for $19.99 but occasionally goes on sale a bit cheaper. Another option is to pick up a copy of The Prepper’s Work- book by Scott B. Williams and Scott Finazzo. The forms and checklists contained within will be of great help as you go about devising all of your emergency plans. Prepping binder Sergei M.

I suggest you use a three-ring bind- er and either buy or make divider tabs for it. The different sec- tions should include, at a minimum: • food storage • water storage • emergency contacts • survival gear • bug-out information The food storage section could contain ongoing inventory sheets so you can keep track of what you have on hand. It might also have recipes for quick off-grid meals and photos and/or descriptions of edible plants in your area. The water storage section should have information on how to disinfect water at home, whether that be through the use of a homemade fi ltration system or a purchased product. It would also be a good idea to list possible sources of water nearby. The emergency contacts section is rather self-explanatory. In addition to the typical information (nearby relatives, phone numbers for poison control, hospitals, etc.), consider including contact numbers, e-mail addresses, and websites for FEMA, the American Red Cross, and any local disaster agencies you may have in your area. The survival gear section should include a checklist keeping track of what you have on hand and what you need to purchase. This is a great place for keeping a list of what to look for at rum- mage sales and thrift shops. The bug-out information section should include a checklist for your bug-out bag contents as well as the evacuation plans you devise.

It isn’t enough to just write them down and talk about them with your family. When we’re confronted with that age-old dilemma of fi ght or fl ight, we often freeze up We don’t know what to do so we become a deer in headlights. However, what experts have found in various studies about the human response to disaster is that if a plan has been practiced, not just once but several times, the body reacts faster when faced with a real disaster. While the brain is still largely concerned with fi guring out what’s going on, the body is already in motion. Your plans won’t do you any good if all you do is just think about them every once in a while. Doing drills allows you to make mistakes and correct them while there’s still time to do so. You can fi nd out what works and what doesn’t without undue risks. Practicing the plans cement them into your mind and body, allow- ing you to react quicker when under stress. There’s a reason why schools practice fi re drills on a regular basis. Your plans should be drilled regularly, to the point that your body will know what to do even while your brain is still trying to process the situation. Sample Drill—Going Off-Grid One drill I suggest everyone do at least a few times a year is to go “off grid” for at least a full day, preferably a full weekend. Turn off the circuit breakers in your home, except for those you truly need, such as for your refrigerator or chest freezer. There’s little sense in destroying food just to make a point. But, make it clear to all involved that, for the duration of the drill, the fridge, freezer, and other appliances are essentially off limits. Trips to the store are also verboten. You and your family may only use what is on hand at the moment the breakers are tripped. Do this drill prior to having much in the way of plans in place and see just how miserable it can be to go without power for a single day. Then, revisit the drill a few months later, after you’ve had time to create your plans and set aside some sup- plies. I think you’ll fi nd family members will see the value in being better prepared. 40 033-049_U9037_03.indd 40 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"If you have family members who are not really interested in disaster preparedness, drills will probably not be a whole lot of fun at the outset. However, these practice sessions can also serve to open some reluctant eyes and even get some folks more interested in the topic. Drills can be planned far in advance, giving family members ample warning. On the other hand, a surprise drill will be much more realistic. Start by giving advanced warning with the fi rst drill then surprise them with the next. Now that we’ve covered the basics, let’s go back and talk about those individual plans in a bit more detail. SHELTERING IN PLACE AT HOME The fi rst plan you should have is for sheltering in place at home . With the exception of attorneys fresh out of law school, home is where we usually spend the most time. Therefore, odds are greatest you’ll be at home when disaster hits. On top of that, home is where you’ll probably have the bulk of your emergency supplies and that’s where you’ll want to be if something hap- pens. In a crisis, I encourage you to remain at home until and unless your home becomes an unsafe location. How long should I be ready to shelter in place? In most cases, routine disasters, such as winter storms, will in- terrupt your daily life for perhaps a couple of days. However, it is far better to plan for the worst-case scenario and then be happily surprised when it turns out to not be quite that bad. My suggestion is to plan to provide for all of your own needs for a minimum of two weeks to a month or so. Overkill? Perhaps, but better to be safe than sorry. What should be included in the shelter in place at home plan? You are going to have to plan to provide your family’s basic needs for the duration of the crisis. These needs include: 41 033-049_U9037_03.indd 41 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"• food • water • fi rst aid • shelter/warmth • security • entertainment As you’ll see in the coming chapters, the bulk of this book is focused on preparing for sheltering in place at home. SHELTERING IN PLACE AT WORK The next plan on the list is for sheltering in place at work . Many, if not most of us, spend a third of our day at our place of employment. Now, you may be thinking, why in the world would I want to spend even more time there? If a disaster hits, I want to get home! You’re right, to a degree. But, consider this—the most likely disaster to befall you will be weather re- lated. Weather disasters often have a rather negative effect on traveling. Think back to the winter of 2014, when motorists in Atlanta, Georgia, were stranded for hours, even overnight in some cases, due to freezing rain. You are probably going to be better off sitting tight and waiting it out, rather than taking a chance on dicey road conditions. You want to have a plan, as well as supplies, in place so you can hunker down at work at least overnight. This is a plan that is often overlooked in many other sur- vival manuals, but it is very important. While eventually return- ing home is obviously the ultimate goal, conditions may prevent that trip from happening immediately. By planning ahead, you may be able to turn an unexpected overnight stay at work into a minor inconvenience, rather than a huge pain in the butt. How long might I have to stay at work if a disaster strikes? That’s diffi cult to predict precisely, but I would plan on perhaps a night or two at the most. The idea here is to plan for a sudden, 42 033-049_U9037_03.indd 42 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"unexpected disaster that prevents you from getting home. Odds are pretty good that if conditions prevent you from getting home after two full days, you’ll have bigger problems on your hands. What supplies do I need to shelter at work? You’ll just need some basics for roughing it at work overnight. • a few snacks and bottles of water • change for the vending machines, in the event power hasn’t been lost • infl atable pillow • full change of clothes • small toiletry kit (toothbrush, toothpaste, baby wipes for washing up) • fl ashlight with spare batteries (something like the Stream- light Stylus Pro would work very well) • sweatshirt or sweater in case it gets chilly overnight • book or some other type of diversion • battery-powered or crank-powered radio so you can lis- ten to news and weather updates All of this can be tossed into a small duffel bag and kept under your desk or in your locker at work. Few people relish the thought of spending any more time at work than is absolutely necessary. But, doing exactly that might be the safest option available to you in the short-term. If a disaster forces you to shelter at work, you’ll probably not be the only one who is spending the night there. While you hope you wouldn’t be the only person who thought ahead, that might very well be the case. Therefore, it might be prudent for you to add a few extras to your kit that you can hand out to coworkers. Of course, you could also mention to them the idea of having a few supplies in their own lockers, just in case. But, as I always say, you can lead a person to knowledge but you can’t make them think. 43 033-049_U9037_03.indd 43 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"GET-HOME PLAN After you are able to get back on the move, you’ll want a plan for bugging out for home . A key element of this plan is to make the assumption that some or all of your journey may be on foot. If it turns out you are able to use a vehicle to get home, just consider that a bonus. Route Planning With the likelihood of foot-travel in mind, the fi rst step in mak- ing your get-home plan is to sit down with a map and plot out Traveling—Think Outside the Box One of the most common elements of a governmental disaster plan involves restrictions on travel. Specifi cally, authorities may not allow vehicular traffi c in or out of affected areas. Should you feel it is necessary to travel, it would be prudent to have planned ahead for ways to do so that don’t involve cars or trucks. Naturally, walking works rather well. In urban areas, this can be the ideal method of transportation as you aren’t limited to streets. Instead, you can cut through alleys and backyards, utilizing shortcuts as needed. You are also far less visible than you would be if you were in a motor vehicle. The drawback, though, is you are limited in what you can carry with you. Another option is to use a bicycle. Bear in mind that bicycles have been used for many, many years as a means of transporting goods as well as a conveyance for people. With the addition of pannier packs, you can load quite a bit of supplies on a single bicycle, then push it rather than ride it if need be. While you’ll be a bit limited in both speed and routes because you may have to carry the bike over spots of debris or rough patches of road, you’ll still move faster and with more stuff than you might on foot alone. What I do not recommend, though, is planning any sort of escape route using underground tunnels unless you are intimately familiar with the ones in your area. All too many people think these drainage tunnels are like the ones they see in the movies—a vast underground network of interconnected pathways, granting you the ability to disappear and reappear wherever you’d like. The truth of the matter is many of these tunnels are exceptionally dangerous, fi lled with toxic gases or worse. And that’s if the tunnel under that manhole cover even goes anywhere. 44 033-049_U9037_03.indd 44 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"several possible routes you could take to get from point A to point B. Being that you have no way of knowing the exact na- ture of the disaster that may force you to enact your emergency plans, you want to have several options available to you when it comes to traveling back home. Your normal route may not be feasible due to storm damage or other detours. Commuters who regularly use public transportation, such as trains or buses, should defi nitely plan alternate means of get- ting home. Depending upon the nature of the disaster, odds are that few of those methods of transport will be available. After you have your routes planned, it’s important to travel each of them on a regular basis. You need to get to know them very well and learn how they look in all seasons as well as during daylight and night. Identify landmarks along each route. When you are under stress, appearances can sometimes be deceiving and you may start to second-guess yourself. Those landmarks will serve to keep you assured you’re on the right track. As I mentioned earlier, plan for the possibility that you’ll be on foot for most or all of your journey. If that means you’ll likely be spending a night on the road, be sure to take that into ac- count with your route planning. Identify potential “rest stops” along the way. For example, if you have a close friend whose home is along your route, talk to him or her about the possibil- ity of you dropping by as you make your way home during or after a disaster. If he or she is a very close friend, you might go so far as to stash some supplies at his place, giving you a cache . Assembling a Get-Home Bag The get-home plan involves putting together a get-home bag (GHB). This is a collection of supplies and gear that can sustain you during your trek home. The GHB differs from the bug-out bag (BOB). Whereas the BOB assumes you are leaving home and not returning for several days or longer, the GHB assumes you have a distinct end point to your journey—your home. 45 033-049_U9037_03.indd 45 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Your GHB should be equipped with the following: Food: Enough to last you through your longest planned route home. The food you pack should be long-lasting, requiring no refrigeration and minimal, if any, preparation prior to consump- tion. Think along the lines of granola bars, roasted nuts, and crackers with peanut butter. Water: Consider two quarts of water a bare minimum. How- ever, water is heavy and many people cannot comfortably carry more than perhaps four quarts. Therefore, be sure to include water purifi cation tablets or a water fi ltration system so you can refi ll your supply during your journey. Aquamira and a few other companies make water bottles with fi lters built in them. A LifeStraw is another product that works in a similar manner, though in this case you are using the LifeStraw to suck water into your mouth from a puddle or stream, rather than storing any of it in a bottle for later consumption. Shelter/Warmth: Be sure you have at least one complete set of clothing in which you’ll be comfortable walking. Many urban dwellers have jobs that require attire that is “business casual” or better. While those clothes may look nice, they may not be the most practical or comfortable for walking home. Don’t forget a pair of comfortable shoes as well as a couple pairs of thick socks. You should also have a good quality emergency blanket, such as those produced by Heatsheets. In inclement weather, these can be used as makeshift rain ponchos as well as for keeping warm. Speaking of warmth, don’t forget supplies for getting a fi re go- ing. Strike-anywhere matches, a couple of butane lighters, and a ferro rod are all recommended, as is some tinder such as dryer lint or cotton balls soaked with petroleum jelly. First Aid: Include a small kit containing adhesive bandages, antibiotic ointment, burn cream, pain relievers, antacids, and anti-diarrhea medications. Elastic bandages for strains/sprains are also a good idea. If you regularly take medications, include enough of those meds to get you through your journey home. 46 033-049_U9037_03.indd 46 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Security/Defense: This is a judgment call on your part. I’m not going to insist you pack a fi rearm and ammunition. In many cities, this isn’t a legal option for civilians and I would never sug- gest you break the law. However, you should have some means of defending yourself. If not a fi rearm, consider pepper spray or a stun gun at the minimum. Tools: A good, sturdy knife should be a part of every survival kit. A multi-tool may also prove to be very handy to have with you. A compass and map of the area may prove very useful, should you lose your way. A bright fl ashlight (with extra batter- ies) is also a must. Practicing Your Get Home Plan Earlier, we talked about conducting drills with your home emer- gency plans. It is important to practice your get-home plan as well. Pick a weekend and have a family member drop you off at work. Put your GHB over your shoulder and head for home. This is really the only way you’ll know if you have what it takes to make the trek. This is also a great way to fi nd out if you’ve packed all you truly need in your GHB as well as learning what you didn’t really need after all. Getting the Kids Home From School Not only should you make plans for getting yourself home from work, but there also needs to be a plan for getting your children home from school. This planning starts with talking to school administrators about their own disaster plans. Find out, prefer- ably by obtaining a copy of the plans in writing, when the school will or will not release students to their parents or designated third-parties. While this information may be found in the stu- dent handbook, emergency management plans can change and you want the most up-to-date information possible. After you have a decent handle on the school district’s plans with regard to emergency management, formulate your own 47 033-049_U9037_03.indd 47 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"plans taking that information into account. Identify who will pick your children up from school or day care, should their nor- mal means of transportation be unavailable. Typically, I suggest this be the parent who is closest to the school. However, if that is not feasible—for example, the parent who works closest to the school also has a job that would prevent them from leaving the workplace quickly—you might consider adding a trusted third- party, such as a grandparent or neighbor, to the “authorized to pick up” list at school. After you’ve determined who will pick up the children, you next need to decide where the children will be taken. While log- ic seems to dictate they’d go to the home of whomever picked them up, that might not be ideal in all situations. Your children should be informed of these plans and kept in the loop with regards to any changes that are made. A general outline of these plans might be kept in the child’s backpack, for their reference as well as school authorities. This outline could be simply stating that in the event of an emergency that neces- sitates the closing of the school or that has other major ramifi ca- tions, you or your appointed representative will pick up your children and take them home. There should also be a list of Talking to Children About Disasters As you go about crafting your various plans, you need to sit down with your chil- dren and discuss the plans with them. It is important to keep these conversations age-appropriate so as to not create unnecessary feelings of anxiety or fear. Scaring the hell out of your kids is the absolute last thing you want to do. What I suggest is to use examples from news stories as well as personal anecdotes to illustrate to children the need for being prepared for emergencies. Perhaps there was a time recently when Aunt Sally was stranded after her car broke down and she had to sit and wait several hours before help arrived. The key is to keep these discussions somewhat light and not full of gloom and doom. An excellent resource for having these conversations with young people is Prepper Pete Prepares: An Introduction to Prepping for Kids by Kermit Jones, Jr. 48 033-049_U9037_03.indd 48 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"contact phone numbers with this plan outline so your children as well as authorities can reach you if need be.

EVACUATING FROM HOME—BUGGING OUT Needless to say, the decision to leave home, possibly for several weeks or more, is not to be made lightly. It is such a signifi cant decision that I’ve devoted an entire chapter to the topic later in this book. As I’ve stressed several times, the ideal situation is such that you’ll be able to shelter in place at home for the dura- tion of the crisis. However, there are disasters that can make staying home unsafe, such as hurricanes or wildfi res. A bug-out plan will be needed so as to get you and your family to a safe location with a minimum of hassle or headache. SUMMARY Disasters are unpredictable and as we go about devising our various plans, we are sort of spit-balling in terms of what we think will happen. However, there are some things we can do to hedge our bets and creating the plans outlined in this chapter is where that starts. 49 033-049_U9037_03.indd 49 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOUR EMERGENCY WATER The importance of having access to clean water during and af- ter a crisis cannot be overemphasized. Waterborne illnesses are one of the top causes of death around the globe. The oft-quoted rule of thumb is that a person can survive approximately three days without water. While that might be true in a purely aca- demic sense, the reality is the latter portion of that time frame will be spent in delirious agony. Common sense should tell you that a person engaging in heavy exertion that may be commonplace during the aftermath of a disaster will need more water than they normally would on a regular day. One of the most common effects of a disaster, particularly in urban areas, is that clean, potable water stops fl owing from the taps. Even if water is still coming into the home, municipalities will issue “boil orders” if there is any risk that the water lines have been contaminated by pollutants or bacteria originating from wastewater lines. This is quite common after natural disas- ters such as fl ooding. Ironic, isn’t it? A disaster may leave your city under a few feet or more of fl oodwater but, without having taken precautions, you could still be suffering from dehydration. The good news is there are several easy things you can do ahead of time to help mitigate the potential loss of running water. 50 050-065_U9037_04.indd 50 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"HOW MUCH WATER SHOULD I STORE? The fi gure that has been tossed around the last several years has been one gallon of water per person per day. I have a few issues with that suggestion. First, you have no way of know- ing how long a crisis may last. Second, one gallon of water per person really isn’t going to go far. Remember, that single gallon may be the only water you have available to you. You’ll need some for drinking, some for food preparation, and some for hygiene. I suggest a minimum of 1½ to 2 gallons of water per person per day. This gives you a cushion to fall back on if you need it. This fi gure is the same for adults and children. While there is no way to know for certain what the future may hold, plan on at least one full week without running water. You can never store too much water, but space constraints will perhaps limit your ability to store as much as you’d like. For a family of fi ve, that comes to about seventy gallons of water to keep on hand at all times (5 people × 2 gallons/day × 7 Flooding Petrov Stanislav © Shutterstock.com 51 050-065_U9037_04.indd 51 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"days). But, wait, you’re not done. If you have pets, you need to fi gure them into the equation. Plan on about a gallon of water per day for one or two dogs, a bit less for cats. If we round up our fi gures, this brings us to roughly eighty gallons of water that needs to be stored in anticipation of a crisis. HOW SHOULD I STORE WATER? Your fi rst line of defense will be to have a quantity of clean wa- ter stored prior to the disaster. While you likely won’t be able to have enough squirreled away to provide baths for each member of the family, you can certainly have enough to keep you and yours alive for the duration. Water Storage Containers There are several different water storage containers on the mar- ket today, with varying capacities from one gallon to seven or more gallons. You will likely have to move these around from time to time, even if just when fi lling them, so keep in mind that a single gallon of water weighs around eight pounds. For many people, the seven-gallon size will be just about as heavy as they can comfortably manage. Examples of these storage containers include the Water- Brick, which comes in two sizes, 1.6 gallon and 3.5 gallon. The neat thing with this product is that WaterBricks are shaped in such a way that they lock together when stacked. The attached handle makes them very easy to move about as well, allowing you to just grab and go if need be. You can fi nd them online at various retailers. I keep several of the Reliance Aqua-Tainers fi lled and on hand for emergencies. They hold seven gallons each and have a built-in spigot for easy dispensing. I’ve seen these sold in most major discount retail stores and they are about half the cost of the WaterBricks. 52 050-065_U9037_04.indd 52 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"PETE Bottles A second option for containers is to recycle soda and juice bottles made of polyethylene terephthalate (PETE). Never use plastic milk jugs for water storage, though. The plastic used in manufac- turing them just isn’t suitable for long-term use and will eventu- ally begin to degrade. If you don’t consume very much soda in your home, you could ask family members to save their two-liter bottles for you. I suggest two-liter sized bottles in particular be- cause they are large enough to make them worthwhile for water storage. You could certainly use the smaller twenty-ounce bottles, but you’ll need many more of them to add up to a decent amount of stored water. Instructions for safely reusing bottles for water storage: 1. Wash the bottles (inside and out) and caps in hot, soapy water and rinse them very well. 2. Fill the bottle with one quart of water and add one teaspoon of non-scented chlorine bleach. 3. Screw on the cap and shake the bottle vigorously to ensure the sanitizing solution reaches every part of the inside of the bottle. 4. Rinse the bottle thoroughly. 5. Fill the bottle with tap water, all the way to the top. If your tap water comes from a municipal utility company, rather than a well, you don’t need to add anything further to the water. 6. If you are using a well or some other source, add two drops of non-scented chlorine bleach to the water and let it sit for about thirty minutes. If aft er that time you do not detect a very faint smell of chlorine in the water, add another two drops of bleach and let the water sit for another fi ft een minutes or so. 7. Swish the bottle around a bit, letting a small amount of water come out the top and leak onto the threads, then screw on the cap. Doing this will prevent pathogens from sneaking in via the threads. 8. Screw on the cap tightly. 53 050-065_U9037_04.indd 53 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Use a marker to jot down on the bottle the date you fi lled it. Just like stored food, stored water should be rotated regularly. I suggest you set up a rotation schedule whereby you use and refi ll the water bottles about every six months. Rather than just pour the old water down the drain, drink it, use it for pets, or pour it on your garden plants. Then, just refi ll the bottles again, follow- ing the above procedure. Of course, you could just go out and buy several cases of bottled water. One advantage in doing so is the water should stay fresh for many years due to the bottling process. If you shop the sales, it isn’t prohibitively expensive either. In my area, it is common to fi nd cases of twenty-four bottles on sale for as little as three dollars. I prefer to save the money, though, and fi ll recycled bottles. If you decide to purchase water for storage, avoid the gallon jugs that look just like the plastic milk jugs. As I noted earlier, those bottles aren’t designed for long-term storage.

Obviously, this isn’t something you’d keep fi lled just in case, but rather a device you’d utilize when disaster hits. The WaterBOB will hold up to one hundred gal- lons of water and keeps it fresh for about four months. They cost around twenty dollars or so and come with a pump for dispensing the water. Now, you may ask yourself, Why couldn’t I just put in the tub stopper and fi ll the tub without using this bag ? Well, I hate to answer a question with a question, but just how clean is your bathtub on a daily basis? Something else to keep in mind with the WaterBOB is that if a “boil water” advisory has been issued, you will still need to treat the water before using it. However, having water that needs to be treated sure beats not having any water available at all. WHERE SHOULD I STORE MY WATER? Whether you buy special containers, cases of water, or use recycled bottles, store the water in a cool, dark place. Base- ments generally work well, provided you can easily go up and down the stairs while carrying the water. I was able to obtain, with full permission, several plastic milk crates from my local grocery store. Those work great for storing recycled bottles of water. If you don’t have a basement, all is not lost. Use the space under your bed or under your couch. The fl oor in the back of a closet or in the back of kitchen cabinets works well, too. No matter how much water you store ahead of time, there is always the possibility you will run out. Your disaster plan should include methods for fi nding additional water and then fi ltering and disinfecting this potentially contaminated water. 55 050-065_U9037_04.indd 55 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"WHERE TO FIND ADDITIONAL WATER INSIDE THE HOME? Even without having purposely stored water in advance of a disaster, there are two places you can fi nd water in your home. Hot Water Heater Your fi rst stop should be your hot water heater. The average hot water heater holds forty to fi fty gallons of water. While there may be slight differences between makes and models, this is the basic procedure for draining a water heater: 1. If it is a gas water heater, turn the thermostat to “Pilot.” If it is an electric model, turn off the power at the circuit breaker box. Do this even if you’ve lost power in the home. Th is is very important! If the heating element turns on when the tank is empty, the element can and likely will be damaged. 2. Near the thermostat should be a small spigot. Attach a length of hose to it. 3. Turn off the cold-water intake valve. Th is is a pipe that runs into the tank, fi lling it with water as the level in the tank goes down. What you want to avoid is having potentially contami- nated water coming into the tank as you drain it. 4. Open one of the hot water faucets in your home. Doing so prevents a vacuum from being created in the water lines. 5. Position a container at the open end of your hose and then open the drain valve. Be careful as this water may still be hot. As the container gets full, replace it with an empty one, turn- ing off the drain valve between containers. 6. Aft er power has been restored to your home, open the cold- water intake valve and allow the tank to fi ll. Don’t forget to close the hot-water faucet as well. Aft er the tank is full, crank up the thermostat (for gas water heaters) or fl ip the circuit breaker (for electric water heaters) back on. Aft er the water has been brought up to temperature, you’ll need to test the pressure-relief valve. Instructions for doing this will be list- 56 050-065_U9037_04.indd 56 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"ed on the side of the water heater or on a tag attached to the valve. If the instructions are missing, check with a plumber to ensure this test is done properly. Toilet Tank Another potential source of water in the home is the toilet tank. However, if you routinely add any sort of cleansers to the tank, this water cannot be made potable, at least not easily. But, you could still use it for limited cleaning purposes, such as washing clothes. If the tank water has not been tainted by cleansers, you can consume it after it has been disinfected. WHERE TO FIND ADDITIONAL WATER OUTSIDE THE HOME? Rain Barrels There are several potential sources of water outside the home to consider. The fi rst of which is rainwater. If you live in a house, rather than an apartment, install gutters if they are not already present. Add fi fty-fi ve-gallon drums at one or more downspouts to collect rainwater. Now, while the water is generally pure as it falls from the sky, it will not remain so after running across the roof and through the gutters. You’ll still need to fi lter and disinfect it prior to consumption. If security of the water is a concern, you could route a hose running from a downspout through a hole drilled in a garage wall and into a barrel hidden inside the garage. Be sure the hole in the wall is caulked well to prevent insect or vermin infesta- tions. It is also worth noting that even a moderate rainfall will fi ll the barrel to overfl owing. If you can, daisy chain a couple of barrels together using kits you can fi nd at any home improve- ment store. I suggest doing this whether the barrels are located inside or outside. Otherwise, you’ll be letting water go to waste. Rain barrels can be found at any home improvement store as well as online. While I’ve run across them for free or cheap on 57 050-065_U9037_04.indd 57 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Craigslist and other similar places, I’m always leery of picking up a used barrel as it is nearly impossible to know for certain what was originally stored in it. If a rainwater catchment system isn’t an option for you, there are a few other sources to consider. Outdoor decorative fountains will collect rainwater, but if they are in public areas, it may be a race to get there fi rst. If rain barrels just aren’t an option for you, it is still possible to collect rainwater by just placing buckets or other containers out- side when it rains. This isn’t a bad option during a crisis, but won’t net you a ton of water unless you set out quite a few containers. Snow and Ice During a winter emergency, snow and ice could be collected and melted. Ice gives you more bang for your buck than snow, as it’s denser. A foot of snow will only net you about an inch of water after it’s melted. During winter, we fi ll fi ve-gallon buckets with snow and bring them inside. The water is used for plants and Opening Fire Hydrants Is a Bad Idea While fi re hydrants may seem like an obvious source for water in an emergency, think again. First, opening a fi re hydrant is a criminal act. While authorities may have bigger issues at that moment, you just might catch the eye of an offi cer who is already having a bad day and decides to take a break from the action by having a talk with you. Second, the fl ow rate is rather substantial and there is no way to just slow it down. The valve on a hydrant is a simple on/off, nothing else. While you might collect some water in a container, a whole lot of the water coming from the hydrant is going to be wasted. Third, by reducing the level of water in the pipes, you are placing your home as well as others at serious risk in the event of a fi re. On top of all that, any water you do collect from a hydrant will still need to be fi ltered and treated as you have no way to know if the water may have been contaminated along the way to you. Relying upon a fi re hydrant for an emergency water supply is just a bad idea. 58 050-065_U9037_04.indd 58 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"pets. We don’t keep the buckets near any particular heat source and rely on the ambient indoor air temperature to melt the snow. Dew While it might not net several gallons of water at once, collect- ing dew is another source of urban water. In the early morning hours, go outside and sponge the dew off vehicles, windows, and other non-porous surfaces. Use a clean sponge or even a couple of clean T-shirts to wipe up the dew, then wring them out into a bucket. You’ll want to fi lter and disinfect the water as it is doubtful your car’s exterior is absolutely pristine. If there is high grass in your immediate area, tie a couple of rags or shirts around your calves and go for a walk, periodically wringing out the water into a bucket. Avoid at all costs obtaining water from heavily pollut- ed streams and rivers. If you live in a heavily urban area and wouldn’t eat fi sh obtained from the river running through the area, you certainly aren’t going to want to sample the water, no matter what fi ltration system you use. HOW DO I FILTER OR PURIFY MORE WATER DURING OR AFTER A DISASTER? Any found water has the potential to be contaminated, so you need to have the means to fi lter and disinfect it before you drink it. Before we go into those various methods, it is important to understand the meaning of fi ltering water and purifying water. Quite often, people use those terms interchangeably and they actually have different and distinct meanings. Filtering water refers to removing harmful or potentially harmful things from the water. For example, debris, bugs, and dirt all should be fi ltered out of the water before consumption. No one likes to chew water, right? Many advanced fi ltration sys- tems even work at the microscopic level, removing the bacteria and other nasty stuff that can and will make you sick. 59 050-065_U9037_04.indd 59 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"The term purifi cation is also something of a misnomer. In all actuality, most of the devices and techniques that we term “puri- fi ers” are actually disinfecting the water, not purifying it. Puri- fying would be having the end result be nothing but two parts hydrogen, one part oxygen. The reality is you will be killing or rendering inert the bacteria and organisms that could harm you rather than removing them entirely from the water. Pre-Filtering Water No matter which method(s) you plan to use for micro-fi ltration and/or disinfection, water should be pre-fi ltered. This removes all visible sediment and debris and allows the other processes to work much more effi ciently and effectively. Pre-fi ltering is as simple as pouring the water through a bandana, although coffee fi lters are a better choice. You could also go a step further and set up a fi ltration station that is comprised of multiple levels. Pour the water fi rst through a layer of sand, then a layer of crushed charcoal, and fi nally through one or two coffee fi lters. Another option, provided you have the time to wait, is to just let the water sit in a jar for an hour or so. This will allow sediment and debris to settle to the bottom. Pour it out carefully so as to not disturb the gunk at the bottom. After the visible debris is removed, the water should then be run through a commercial water fi ltration system or it should be disinfected through another method before you can consider it safe for drinking. Disinfecting Method 1: Commercial Water Filtration Systems Perhaps the easiest way to accomplish turning questionable water into potable water is to run it through a commercially manufactured water fi ltration system. Berkey and Aquamira are two of the most popular brand names of these products. These systems come in an array of sizes and capabilities, from a system small enough to fi t into your pocket to tabletop versions. While 60 050-065_U9037_04.indd 60 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"they tend to be rather expensive, they are certainly worth the price. Many of these units utilize ceramic fi lters and will remove just about everything except heavy metals that might be present. The smaller units, such as those that are incorporated into water bottles, use proprietary fi lters constructed of various ma- terials rather than ceramics. The end result is a reduction of over 99 percent of harmful organisms and spores. Again, though, they aren’t going to do much about chemical pollution. Another small and portable option is the LifeStraw. It will fi lter about 250 gallons of water before it needs to be replaced. To use, you simply place the working end into the questionable water and suck it through the straw into your mouth. The in- ternal fi lters remove 99.9 percent of all waterborne pathogens and cysts. Roughly nine inches long and weighing around two ounces, a LifeStraw can be carried anywhere. You can fi nd them for sale on many websites, including Amazon.com, and they run about twenty dollars or so. Vestergaard, the company behind the LifeStraw, recently came out with a larger unit called the LifeStraw Family. Still very porta- ble, this unit will fi lter out 99.9 percent of just about anything that can hurt you, aside from chemicals and heavy metals, and will do so at the rate of nine to twelve liters per hour. There is a two-liter A LifeStraw is an excellent tool for providing clean water in an urban area. 61 050-065_U9037_04.indd 61 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"bucket at one end of the system, which is where the “raw” water goes. The water then runs through a hose and a membrane fi lter, ending at a tap that is turned on to release the fi ltered water. A bit pricier than the original LifeStraw, the Family version costs around eighty dollars or so. But, you’ll be able to fi lter a lot more water at a time, so this is a great option for families or small groups. Moving one more step up in size is the Big Berkey Filtration System. It is pricey, around a few hundred dollars, but it will fi lter in the neighborhood of three gallons of water per hour. It uses a system of ceramic fi lters to remove just about every- thing—pathogens, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and heavy metals. As proof of its capabilities, it will even remove food coloring from water. If you can afford it, the Big Berkey is certainly a wise investment, particularly for families. Disinfecting Method 2: Boiling The absolute best way to ensure you kill any harmful organisms is to boil the water. Experts vary as to whether just bringing the water to a hard boil is enough or if you should let it boil for several minutes. I tend to err on the side of caution. If you have the means to bring the water to a boil, odds are you also are able to keep it boiling for a few minutes. One way to ensure the water has reached a temperature high enough to kill anything nasty is to use a Water Pasteurization Indicator (WAPI). It’s a sealed transparent plastic tube with wax inside. The WAPI is placed into the heating water and once the wax melts, you know pasteurization has been accomplished. There are many ways to heat the water if your electric range is not operable due to a power outage. These include charcoal or propane grills, camp stoves, and even campfi res. Disinfecting Method 3: Water Purification Tablets If boiling water isn’t feasible for some reason, such as you lack fuel or want to preserve what little fuel you have, you can use 62 050-065_U9037_04.indd 62 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"water purifi cation tablets. These are available online as well as in most big box stores that sell camping equipment. Water purifi cation tablets are very easy to use with instruc- tions printed on the side of the bottle. These tablets use one of two different chemicals to disinfect the water. The ones that use iodine can give the water a funny taste but adding a powdered drink mix to the water after it has been disinfected can help in that regard. The other tablets use chlorine dioxide, which tends to result in cleaner-tasting water. Disinfecting Method 4: Iodine Tincture Iodine tincture can also be used to disinfect water. Look for small bottles that are labeled as being 2 percent iodine, which you can fi nd at just about any pharmacy or discount retailer. Use fi ve to seven drops for a liter of clear water. If the water is very cold or cloudy, add eight to ten drops per liter of water. Stir or shake the water to mix in the iodine and then let it sit for thirty minutes. The iodine does give a slight bitter taste to the water. If you fi nd this to be too unpalatable, cover it up by adding pow- dered drink mix after the water has been disinfected. Disinfecting Method 5: Bleach Bleach will also disinfect water. Use non-scented chlorine bleach and check the label to make sure it is 5.25 percent to 8.25 percent chlorine. Most bottles of bleach you’ll fi nd in stores will fall into that range. Add fi ve drops of bleach per liter of water (¼ teaspoon per gallon) and stir or shake it up. If the water is extremely cold or cloudy, double the dosage. Let it sit uncovered for thirty to sixty minutes to allow the chlorine gas to dissipate. You should still smell a faint whiff of bleach after the allotted time has passed. If you don’t, do it all over again. Something to remember, though, is bleach has a limited shelf life. After the bottle is opened, it will only last about six months at full strength. It then begins to degrade. Fortunately, 63 050-065_U9037_04.indd 63 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"there is a way to make a version of bleach at home. You’ll need to purchase some calcium hypochlorite, commonly referred to as “pool shock.” It is sold for as little as fi ve dollars a pound at pool supply stores. Avoid any varieties that have fungicide or other similar additives. To use calcium hypochlorite for purifying water, add ½ tea- spoon of it to a gallon of water. Mix thoroughly using a wooden spoon or another non-metallic implement. Do not drink this mixture , as it is essentially bleach! You add this mixture to the water to be purifi ed in a 1:100 ratio. This breaks down to: • 1 pint shock solution to 12.5 gallons of water • 1 cup shock solution to 6.25 gallons of water • ½ cup shock solution to 3.125 gallons of water • 4 tablespoons shock solution to 1.5 gallons of water Mix it thoroughly and pour it between a couple of contain- ers to help get rid of the chlorine scent. It is important to remem- ber a couple safety rules when dealing with this chemical. 1. It will corrode metal, so keep it in plastic bottles. Use wooden spoons for mixing. 2. Keep it away from petroleum products so it doesn’t ignite spontaneously. As long as you keep the granules dry, they will last pretty much forever. Further, since you are using so little of it each time, even a small one-pound package will get you through a long-term crisis. Disinfecting Method 6: UV Light A disinfecting method that is relatively new to consumer use is treating with ultraviolet (UV) light. It is a very quick and easy way to disinfect a liter of water in about a minute. Using a UV portable water purifi er, you place the end of the device into the water, press a button, and a burst of UV light is sent out, killing off anything in the water. There are a few different products on the market right now that work using this approach.

Be sure to read the package care- fully and stock up on the necessary type of batteries for the unit you purchase. You can use the same science to do it yourself, though it takes vastly longer. Solar distillation (SODIS) uses UV rays from the sun to purify water. Simply fi ll a clear (not green, it must be clear) plastic bottle with water and lay it down on its side in the sun, preferably on a dark surface. It will take about eight hours of fairly clear skies to purify the water, a couple days if the skies are somewhat cloudy. You can do this in bulk, lining up several bottles to purify at the same time. You want the bottles on their sides so as to expose as much surface area to the sun as pos- sible. The dark surface under the bottles absorbs the sun’s heat, transferring some of it to the water. The heat, combined with the UV rays, purifi es the water. In an urban area, perhaps the best location for this would be on the roof of an apartment building as that will limit shade obstructions as the sun passes over. DOES ALL WATER NEED TO BE DISINFECTED BEFORE USING? Any water that will be consumed, or used for preparing food, brushing your teeth, or washing dishes that will be used for eat- ing needs to be disinfected. Water to be used for sponge baths, washing clothes, or cleaning surfaces that don’t come into con- tact with food will not need disinfected water. You may want to at least fi lter the water, though, as few people would really want to wash their hands in water with bugs fl oating on top. SUMMARY It is important to reserve your stored water and any water you dis- infect for consumption. As we said at the beginning of the chapter, water is critical to life. Do everything you can to ensure you have a good supply of potable water during and after a disaster. 65 050-065_U9037_04.indd 65 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVE FOOD STORAGE In the aftermath of a disaster, you don’t want to rely on out- side assistance to keep your belly full. While relief agencies may eventually get some sort of “soup kitchen” arrangement set up, you want to be ahead of the game rather than standing in line for some meager rations. Stocking up on food, even just a little at a time, puts you in a much better position to provide for your family, no matter what circumstances you face. Bear in mind, too, that you cannot expect to be able to serve fi ve-course gourmet meals in a disaster. Instead, the purpose of food storage is to reduce what that great philosopher and honey connoisseur Winnie the Pooh would call, “the rumblies in your tumblies.” Forget the diet plans and the low-carb/no-carb non- sense. Worry about being able to get to sleep at night without the missed-meal-cramps keeping you awake. BEST FOODS FOR STORAGE In the fi rst day or two of an ongoing crisis, you’ll want to con- sume what you can from your refrigerator and freezer before the stuff goes bad. Generally speaking, frozen food will stay frozen in a fully stocked freezer for about twenty-four hours, provided you aren’t opening it very often. Get in the habit now of adding 66 066-084_U9037_05.indd 66 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"jugs of water to your freezer to take up empty space. The more dead air there is in the freezer, the quicker the items will thaw if the power goes out. Plus, those jugs of water add to your overall water storage. After you’ve consumed the fresh food, or it has passed the point of being safe to eat, you’ll need to turn to foods that are shelf-stable and have a relatively long shelf life. Store What You Eat, Eat What You Store Don’t waste your money purchasing food you don’t like. Stick with foods you already eat and enjoy, concentrating on items that will last a while on the shelf. You know better than I or any other expert out there what your family will and will not eat. Yes, if a person gets hungry enough, they’ll likely forget about being all too picky. But, the whole point here is to try and keep life as normal as possible during and after a crisis. Why put yourself or your family through more unpleasantness if you can avoid it? Ease of Preparation Do not plan on making any complex recipes. You aren’t going to be whipping egg whites into peaks and then folding them into anything. At best, you are going to drop an egg into a glass of water to make sure it is still good (if it sinks to the bottom, it is good to eat), then crack it into a skillet, scramble it if you so desire. That’s about as complicated as you should plan on being when it comes to off-grid food preparations. In fact, if Quick Tip Fill empty space in your freezer with jugs of water. Not only does this help your freezer be more effi cient, it will give you a twenty-four-hour buffer to keep food frozen if the power goes out. These jugs also add to the amount of water you have stored for emergencies. 67 066-084_U9037_05.indd 67 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"a recipe involves more than about three different steps, forget about making it during an emergency. Open and Eat. Start with foods that require absolutely no prep work before eating. Granola bars, dried fruits and nuts, peanut butter and crackers, that sort of thing. Having a stash of this stuff will go a long way toward getting you through a short-term emergency. Don’t overlook basic comfort foods, ei- ther. Bagged popcorn, chips, chocolate, and a couple cans of soda are the makings of a fun little “power’s out” party with the kids. They’ll appreciate the treats and you’ll like not having to fi gure out the best way to feed them a decent dinner. One night of junk food isn’t going to kill anyone. Heat and Eat. Next on the list are the “heat-n-eat” foods. These include canned goods like pasta, stew, soup, and vegeta- bles. Yes, I know, the mere thought of eating canned anything might send foodies into apoplectic fi ts. However, a hot bowl of Dinty Moore beef stew beats a bowl of nothing but air. Also in this category are dehydrated soups like ramen noodles. If you have the means to boil water, which we talked about in chapter four, you have the ability to make soup. Quick Baking Mixes. Sometimes overlooked are baking mixes. Any of the “just add water” varieties will do nicely. Avoid mixes that require the use of milk, eggs, and other ingredients. If the emergency lasts more than a couple days, you will appreciate the variety these mixes can provide. You can make pancakes in the morning, then do sandwich wraps in the afternoon or evening. FIFO FIFO stands for First In, First Out. Rotating your food storage is critical to ensure you don’t end up with a ton of outdated food on your hands. Get into the habit of taking a marker and writing the purchase date on all canned and boxed goods before putting them away. When it comes time to make dinner, always grab the oldest products fi rst. 68 066-084_U9037_05.indd 68 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Trust me, while everyone else is scrounging their cupboards for bouillon cubes and condensed cream of mushroom soup, you’ll be eating high on the hog! Beverages As you plan your food storage, don’t forget things like drink mixes, tea bags, and instant coffee. Personally, I’m not a big water drinker so I like to have things like powdered juice to add to it. Coffee and tea will be important to those of you who are avowed caffeine addicts. Vitamin Supplements In the event of a fairly long-term event, a bottle of multi-vitamins would be advisable to have on hand as well. This will help prevent any nutritional defi ciencies caused by lack of dietary variety. Scurvy, the bane of pirates everywhere, for example, is caused by a lack of vitamin C. While it certainly doesn’t happen overnight, vitamin defi ciencies can creep up on you without you realizing it. Freeze-Dried Food It also isn’t a bad idea to invest in some food that is designed for extreme long-term storage. These freeze-dried items are the kind of food you can fi nd in the camping section of most big box stores and outdoor retailers. Most of these foods just require the addition of hot water to rehydrate the contents of the pouch. Can Openers Don’t forget to pick up a couple manual can openers! Even if you have one sitting in a kitchen drawer right now, buy another one to keep as a backup. Murphy’s Law has a bad habit of popping in at the worst times and just when you need a can opener the most, that’s when either you won’t be able to fi nd it or it will fall apart in your hands as you try to open something. 69 066-084_U9037_05.indd 69 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"However, before spending a ton of money on this stuff, I highly recommend you purchase a few samples fi rst and try them out.

Should you decide to explore the freeze-dried option a bit, I highly recommend: • Freeze Dry Guy, www.freezedryguy.com • Nitro-Pak Preparedness Center, www.nitro-pak.com MREs Prepackaged foods called MREs, or Meals Ready-to-Eat, were originally developed for use in the military and, in recent years, have become commercially available. Some of the ones being sold online are actual military surplus but many are look-alikes. A full MRE consists of a variety of items packaged together, including a main dish, a side dish, crackers, some sort of cracker spread, utensils, and a fl ameless heater. Many suppliers online also sell just the entrées. The quality of MREs varies consider- ably, as does the cost. I recommend shopping around, compar- ing prices online, then purchasing one or two individual MREs and trying them before committing to buying case lots. HOW MUCH FOOD SHOULD BE STORED? This is sort of like those dreaded word problems in math class, where you are utterly convinced there just isn’t enough informa- tion provided to determine the answer. Truth be told, no one knows what the future holds, despite what televangelists, al- leged psychics, and the kook walking down the street carrying a sign that reads, “The end is nigh!” will tell you. The best answer is to store as much food (and other supplies) as you can afford. 70 066-084_U9037_05.indd 70 7/29/14 12:44 PM"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Start with a goal of having enough extra food to last your family for a full seven days. For some, that in and of itself might be a big change. If you’re accustomed to eating out fi ve nights a week, you might not have much on your shelves at any given time. If you fall into that category, that needs to change! Sit down and write out a menu plan for seven days. Account for all meals, including snacks, and make sure you plan on all family members being present for each meal. Junior probably won’t be heading off to football practice in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. Concentrate on foods that meet the guidelines we just discussed. For example, for Day 1 you might plan on pancakes with canned peaches for breakfast, a light lunch of rice with canned chipped beef and canned peas, then chicken noodle soup (pouch soup mix with a can of chicken added) and dumplings for din- ner. Snacks for that day could include crackers with peanut but- ter or perhaps dried fruit or trail mix. Actually writing out these menu plans will give you a good idea of just how much food you’ll need to store for the week. After you’ve met the one-week goal, extend it to two weeks, then a month, then three months. Keep adding to the storage un- til you feel comfortable you can feed your family through virtu- ally any unexpected crisis. Such an emergency could include job loss or an unexpected expense, for example, a massive car repair bill. Having extra food stored will reduce your grocery expenses in tough fi nancial times. HOW CAN I AFFORD ALL THAT FOOD? For most of us who live paycheck to paycheck, we just cannot reasonably expect to go out and buy enough food for a month or more in a single shopping trip. Instead, add to your storage a little at a time. If your local grocery store has a great sale on canned vegetables, grab a few extra to set aside. Sure, if you can afford to buy a case of them, go for it! But, even just a couple of extra cans each week will add up quickly. 71 066-084_U9037_05.indd 71 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"It helps to spread out your food storage purchases over time. Add one or two extra items to your grocery cart each visit to the store. This lessens the impact on your wallet while you’re build- ing up your supplies. Shop the sale ads and use coupons when it makes sense to do so. For example, let’s say you have a coupon for fi fty cents off two cans of name-brand stew. If that brings the price down below the sale price on the store brand, use it. Something to keep in mind is that the generic brands are often the exact same food as the name brand stuff. Not always, of course, but often enough to make it worth your while to explore those cheaper options. Warehouse stores can also be a great resource, if you use common sense. I mean, no one really needs a fi fty-fi ve-gallon drum of barbecue sauce, no matter how cheap it might be. I’d also be wary of buying anything in the Number 10 size cans. Typically, these are sold to restaurants and such. While the price per ounce can be fantastic, keep in mind that for most foods, you’ll need a way to keep the leftovers from going bad, such as refrigeration. If the power is out for an extended length of time, you’ll only get one meal out of that big can and the rest will go to waste. But, if you have a large family, one that would prob- ably eat everything in a Number 10 can in a single meal, this is a cost-effective approach. Urban Food Production One great way to reduce your grocery bill is to produce at least some of your own food. While urban preppers typically have small yards, you don’t need vast acres of farmland to grow at least a little food. Even a small garden bed of sixteen square feet can produce a fair amount of food. The amount, of course, varies with what you decide to grow and the conditions of that particular growing season. If you have not gardened before, I suggest you stop by a local garden nursery or the garden department of your local 72 066-084_U9037_05.indd 72 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"big box home improvement store. Talk to the people working there about the plants that grow well in your area. When buying seeds or seedlings, try to stick with heirloom varieties. These are plants that are pure strains, rather than hybrids. This means the seeds from the vegetables and fruits you grow can be planted next season. Hybrid varieties result in mutant plants that often don’t produce edible fruits or vegetables. I also recommend doing some research into square foot gardening. This is a gardening system popularized by Mel Bar- tholomew. It is designed to maximize garden production by di- viding the garden into small sections and pairing up plants that complement one another. Pick up one of Bartholomew’s books on the subject, then plan your own garden accordingly. Container gardening is an option for those who live in apart- ments or otherwise don’t have any yard space available. There is a wide range of planters and other patio containers available. Urban Foraging If you know what you’re doing, and know where to look, there are many ed- ible plants growing wild in the city. However, urban foraging has a few unique challenges when compared to foraging out in the sticks. First, there is a strong possibility that pesticides and herbicides have been sprayed on plants growing in city parks and such. While some of those chemicals can be simply washed off the plants, I don’t know that I’d want to bet my health on it. Second, collecting plants in city parks and other public areas may be against the law. In the wake of a major disaster, enforcement of such laws may be over- looked but do you really want to be a test case? If foraging for wild edibles is of interest to you, I recommend visiting your local library and checking out several fi eld manuals and other books to assist you in learning how to identify the plants in your area. Related closely to foraging is gleaning . This is where you visit farm fi elds and orchards, picking produce that has been left behind by the owners of the fi elds. This should only be done with full permission, of course. Gleaning can be a great way to help augment your food storage with fresh fruit and vegetables. 73 066-084_U9037_05.indd 73 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Purchase a few of them, as well as soil, from home improvement stores. Container gardening is also a great way to get around pesky homeowner association rules that forbid large gardens. Few HOAs will complain about a few planter boxes on your deck or patio. WHERE DO I STORE ALL THIS STUFF? One of the diffi culties with food storage in an urban or suburban home is your space may be severely limited. If you’re in an apart- ment or condo, you just aren’t going to have as much room as someone who has a full basement under their home. Fortunately, there are several places in even the smallest apartment where you can squirrel away goodies for a rainy day, without turning your pad into something that looks like it should be featured on Hoarders . Under the Bed The average can of soup or beans is about 3 inches in diameter. A queen-sized bed is 60 × 80 inches, not counting the frame and headboard. A bit of fi fth-grade level math tells us that you could fi t roughly fi ve hundred cans of food under the bed. Of course, that will go down a little bit depending on how you store the cans, such as using a plastic tray or cardboard boxes. Even so, that’s a ton of food in a pretty small space. Depending on how high your bed sits off the fl oor, you might even be able to dou- ble-stack the cans. Risers, found at most big-box retailers, raise the bed higher, allowing for more storage space underneath. Granted, it isn’t the best idea to have the entire fl oor under your bed covered in canned food, if only because of the diffi - culty of reaching and rotating it all. However, let’s say you have one queen-sized bed and two double beds in your condo. You could put three hundred cans of food under the queen bed and 150 under each of the doubles. That still gives you six hundred cans of food! 74 066-084_U9037_05.indd 74 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Closets Even the smallest of living spaces usually has at least one or two closets. Start by ditching the stuff in those closets that you really will never use again. The shoes that went out of style years ago would be a good start. Then, use the back wall of the closet for food storage. You could build shelves or install a pre-fabricated storage system. Really, though, just stacking a few cases of canned goods on the fl oor will work fairly well. Basement Many apartment buildings allow tenants a small amount of storage space in the basement. It often isn’t a lot of space or very secure. Even so, this is space you can use for food storage. What you might consider doing is concealing the food from prying eyes. Rather than have your storage unit fi lled with cases that say Campbell’s Soup on the sides, repackage the cans in a box on which you’ve written something like, “Grandma’s shoes.” If you go this route, be sure to keep the boxes up off the fl oor.

Quick Tip There is a wide range of plastic storage bins that are specifi cally designed for under-the-bed storage. However, most of them, especially the ones with wheels, aren’t made to withstand the weight of canned food. They should still slide OK over carpet but if you have hard fl oors, put down an old bath towel fi rst, then place the container on the towel.

While it won’t necessarily hurt you to open a can of chili and eat it cold, doing so certainly won’t do much for your morale or your taste buds. Electricity is one of the fi rst things to go in most disasters and microwave ovens as well as electric ovens and cooktops don’t work so well without it. If you are fortunate enough to have a gas stovetop, you may be able to use it as long as the gas service is still working. Even if that is the case, though, you should be prepared for off-grid cooking. Fortunately, there are a number of options available for cook- ing food when the stove burners and nuke machine aren’t working. Warning! Please note that none of the following cooking methods should be used indoors. Each should instead be utilized outside, on a patio or deck if not in the yard itself. Never run the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning! Patio Grills From the suburban homeowner to the apartment dweller, patio grills are likely the most common alternative cooking method to be found already in use. While we often think of grills as being used primarily for cooking meat and the occasional vegetable, you can, in fact, cook almost anything on a charcoal or propane grill. That said, fi ring up the charcoal grill just to heat up a can of soup is rather ineffi cient. For smaller portion cooking, you’d be better off to explore some of the other options in this section. But, if a patio grill is all you have, so be it. Do what you can to increase the effi ciency by boiling water at the same time or cook- ing several dishes at once. If you plan on using a patio grill for off-grid cooking during an emergency, plan ahead and always make sure you have plenty of extra charcoal or at least one full propane tank in reserve. In a pinch, you could even use branches or wood scraps in the charcoal grill. 76 066-084_U9037_05.indd 76 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Patio Fire Pits In recent years, these have become rather popular. In addition to providing nice ambience on a cool evening, they can be used in a similar manner to a charcoal grill. Pick up an old grill grate and stash it in the garage for later use over the fi re pit. You can fi nd old grates at rummage sales or even in the neighbor’s trash if you keep your eyes open. Get a good fi re going in the pit and let it burn down to coals. Place the grate across the top and you’re ready to cook! There are two different types of patio fi re pits. The most com- mon is the wood burning type and this is preferred over the gas models. In a pinch, you could even use charcoal in a wood burning fi re pit. That’s not a viable option with most gas-fueled fi re pits. Camp Stoves A propane camp stove is going to give you the closest approxi- mation to cooking on a regular stovetop.

A bonus is these units are portable and easy to use. Simply light the burner, adjust to how high or low you want, and cook away. The downside, though, is you must store fuel for the stove. These stoves and the required fuel can be found in the camping sections of big box stores and outdoor retailers. Campfires Many a hearty meal has been prepared over an old-fashioned campfi re, of course, but, this requires both a clear spot in the yard and plenty of fuel. For those who’ve not cooked this way before, I highly suggest you become familiar with it through plenty of practice before the time comes when you truly need the skills. There is just as much art as there is skill to preparing a meal this way. If you determine this is a viable method of cooking for your location, you could invest in a campfi re tripod. These are found just about anywhere camping gear is sold. The tripod consists of three metal legs with a chain running down the middle of them, Camp stove Rob Byron © Shutterstock.com 78 066-084_U9037_05.indd 78 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"suspending a cooking grate above the fi re. The chain can be used to raise or lower the grate. They are very nice to have and also work well with patio fi re pits. Rocket Stoves A rocket stove takes open-fl ame cooking to a whole new level. Essentially, a rocket stove consists of a burn chamber where the fuel is inserted coupled to a chimney. The updraft created in the chimney causes the fl ame to be much hotter and more concentrat- ed than you’d have with a traditional campfi re. As a bonus, there is almost no smoke generated once the fi re is burning briskly. The fuel used for a traditional rocket stove is small-diameter sticks and branches. Typically these are no wider than a cou- ple inches in diameter. These sticks are fed into the combustion chamber at the bottom of the stove. The Zoom Versa rocket stove by EcoZoom is my personal favorite. It gets high marks not only because it is very sturdily constructed but it is well insulated, preventing accidental burns if you inadvertently brush up against it. It also comes with a windscreen that attaches to the bottom of your cook pot. This allows the heat to be directed at the bottom and sides of the pot, with very little going to waste. You can fi nd this stove at www. ecozoomstove.com. Spirit Stoves These are small stoves, usually about half the size of a soda can that use denatured alcohol for fuel. Most of them will also burn methanol, commonly sold as the brand name HEET, an additive for a vehicle’s fuel tank. While rubbing alcohol would work for fuel, it generates a lot of soot. The basic spirit stove consists of a small fuel reservoir with holes punched around the rim that act as the burner. Add fuel through the central hole or group of holes in the middle of the container. Then cover this central hole and light the fumes coming out of the rim. 79 066-084_U9037_05.indd 79 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Spirit stoves work very similarly to cans of Sterno. They’re the same basic concept—a can of fuel that is lit. Because there is no real structure to the burner, you’ll need to provide a means to support your pot or pan. Three stones placed in a triangle shape around the burner, with the pot resting on top of the stones, works well. Another option would be to use a couple of bricks, one on each side with the burner in the middle. The pot should be placed on the bricks, not on the burner itself. Buddy Burner The buddy burner is an easy DIY project. You’ll need an empty and clean tuna can, corrugated cardboard, and a few old candles or wax crayons. Cut the corrugated cardboard into strips that are just slightly narrower than the depth of the can. When you cut the strips, you want to cut across the corrugation, so the long side of the strip shows the “holes” of the corrugation. Coil these strips in the can, starting from the inside edge and working your way toward the middle of the can. You want the entire can fi lled with the cardboard strips.

You can use an old, beat-up double- boiler you’ve picked up at a thrift store (don’t use your good one) or you can make one yourself by using an empty and cleaned out soup can placed in a pot of water. Fill the can about two-thirds full with broken candle pieces or old crayons. Heat the water to just below boiling and stir the wax to break up the clumps as it melts. After the wax is fully melted, pour it over the cardboard, going slowly and letting it soak in. You could also insert a few pieces of candlewick into the wax, should you wish to do so, before the wax fi rms up. After the wax is solid, the buddy burner is ready for use. Light the wicks or just lay a lit match on the burner and it will light the wax. Just like with the spirit stove, you’ll need a few rocks or something to support your pot over the fl ame. Don’t place your pot directly on the burner. When you’re done cook- ing, smother the fl ame with a piece of aluminum foil or a lid to a cooking pan.

Search Google for solar oven and you’ll fi nd a ton of plans for building a simple solar oven out of a cardboard box. These ovens work well and are very cheap and easy to build. The downside is they take some time to work. Figure at least a few hours if not longer, depending on the strength of the sun- light. And, obviously, these ovens aren’t going to work after the sun goes down. You’ll also need a location that receives a good amount of direct sunlight. In other words, this isn’t something that will work well by placing it on a covered patio area.

Bear in mind that with most of the cooking options listed ear- lier, you won’t be able to use what you might normally use for pots and pans. Simply put, many modern pots and pans aren’t designed to withstand the higher heat you’ll be using. Plastic handles will melt, for example, and thin pan bottoms will not give you good results. Hit your local thrift shops and purchase a couple pans that you can set aside for emergency use. Look for thick bottoms and metal handles. If you come across anything cast iron, snap it up! Cast-iron pots work exceedingly well when cooking over any sort of open fl ame. They’ll likely need to be cleaned up and properly seasoned, of course. While just about every home likely has insulated pot hold- ers or oven mitts, consider picking up a couple to keep with your stash of emergency cookware. When you are cooking over a fl ame with a metal-handled pot, you’re not going to want to grab that handle with a bare hand. You’ll also want to use long-handled spatulas and tongs when cooking over an open fl ame. If you already have those for using with your patio grill, you’re all set. Otherwise, add them to your thrift store shopping list. You might also consider setting aside a couple stacks of pa- per plates and bowls to use when eating meals. Given how valu- able water will be in an emergency, you won’t want to have to use any for washing plates and such if you can avoid it. Of course, you could also opt to eat right out of your pot or pan, but that doesn’t work out too well with a large family. Silver- ware doesn’t take much water to wash, but you could include a box of plastic forks and spoons, if you were so inclined. It is also a great idea to include a roll or three of aluminum foil with your emergency cooking gear.

It’s bad enough to be stuck at home for several days with no electricity and little food and water, but add in the stench from body odors and waste, and you have a recipe for extreme depression. WHERE WILL WE GO WHEN WE HAVE TO, UM, GO? City sewer and water service is likely going to be non-existent after a disaster. Proper waste disposal is necessary for health reasons and will still need to be achieved. Improper sanitation practices can lead to the spread of many deadly diseases, includ- ing dysentery and cholera. The vast majority of fl ush toilets do not truly need water pressure to operate. The water pressure is only necessary for automatic fi lling of the tank. You can refi ll that tank with any water you have on hand—from rain barrels, pools, whatever. However, doing so will use up precious wa- ter that you may need for hydration.

Fortunately, there are several options available that will be far more comfortable than just squatting over a hole you’d dig in the backyard. Alternate Toilets The fi rst alternate toilet option is to line your toilet bowl with a heavy-duty garbage bag (construction grade) and replace the bag as needed. You’ll fi rst need to drain the water from the toi- let, of course. You can either scoop it out or fl ush it out. To fl ush it out, start by turning the water off if you still have pressure. There should be a small hose running from the toilet tank to a valve coming out of the wall. Turn the valve off, then fl ush the toilet as you normally would. After the water in the tank has refi lled the toilet, fl ush it again. You should then be left with just a small amount of water in the very bottom of the toilet bowl. Use a rag or sponge to soak up the remaining water. Human waste is heavy, perhaps heavier than you’d fi rst imagine. Without getting into the nasty details, suffi ce to say that the average bowel movement could weigh in the neighbor- hood of three to fi ve pounds. In other words, you aren’t going to want that garbage bag to get overly full before you replace it. The next option is to use a fi ve-gallon pail, the sort you can fi nd for cheap or even free at restaurants, bakeries, and delis. If you shop around at camping stores, you can even fi nd toilet seats that are specially made to attach to these buckets. Otherwise, you can use the seat from your existing toilet seat, though it won’t sit perfectly on the bucket. You can either line the bucket with a garbage bag or fi ll it about a quarter-full with cat litter or sand. If you go with the latter option, keep a supply of litter or sand nearby so people can cover their leavings when they’re done relieving themselves. Again, this bucket is going to get heavy so be sure to empty it periodically. 86 085-100_U9037_06.indd 86 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"With any of the above solutions, you might also consider keeping a box of baking soda or a container of powdered laun- dry detergent nearby. A little sprinkle will help keep odors down. You could also purchase one of a wide range of available chemical toilets sold in sporting goods stores. Be sure to stock up on the chemicals used in that brand of potty. Disposing of the Waste If this is a short-term disaster, one that will obviously be resolved in a matter of days, you could place the bags of waste into your trashcans. However, if it appears sewer and water services won’t be available any time soon, say, within a couple of weeks or so, you’ll have to explore other waste disposal options. If you have a decent sized yard, and your yard is well away from natural water sources, such as rivers, streams, and ponds, you might consider burying the waste. Dig a hole at least three feet deep and put the bags in. If you have some type of gravel available, put down a layer of it on top of the bags, then cover it up. Make sure the hole is at least a few hundred feet away from any potential natural water source to avoid is contaminating ground water. Building a latrine is another possibility, though a bit more labor intensive. Dig a trench in the ground at two to three feet deep and about eighteen inches wide. Leave the dirt you’ve re- moved nearby. To use the latrine, you straddle the trench and do your business, then scrape or shovel some of the dirt over what you’ve left behind. Using clotheslines to suspend old bed sheets or a shower curtain along the trench can afford some measure of privacy. While a trench latrine won’t be much fun in inclement weather, it is something to consider if you are without water for a long period of time. Burning it is another option. Get a fi re going and put the bags on, one at a time. This isn’t going to smell good, but it will serve to kill off bacteria and germs present in the waste. 87 085-100_U9037_06.indd 87 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"What if we run out of toilet paper? Ideally, you’ll have stocked up on plenty of toilet paper to see you through at least a few weeks. If you do run out, though, you have a few options. Perhaps the best solution is to take old cotton T-shirts and cut them up into squares about four inches to a side. Place a bucket with a lid on it next to the commode. Into the bucket, put in a strong bleach and water mix, maybe a 1:1 ratio. As the cotton wipes get used, toss them into the bucket. Wash them for reuse. (We’ll get to laundry instructions in a bit.) Baby wipes are another great alternative, and not only for cleaning dirty bottoms. They work well for quick sponge bath- ing. Even if you don’t have babies in the home, I suggest you pick up a box or two to stash away in case of emergencies. Back in the old days, people used old catalogues and news- papers. This is still a workable solution today, though not nearly as soft as real toilet paper. Still, any port in a storm, right? MAINTAINING HYGIENE AFTER A DISASTER If you luck out and the faucets are still running, great! But, don’t count on it. Therefore, taking baths or even long showers aren’t going to be options. Frequent Hand Washing Your fi rst line of defense should be frequent hand washing. If you are unable to do anything else, do everything you can to keep your hands clean. On average, we touch our own faces about sixteen times an hour, or roughly every three minutes. Ev- ery time we do, we transfer germs and bacteria from our hands close to our eyes, nose, and mouth, all of which are openings into our bodies. If you don’t have running water, set up a bowl or bucket with a bottle of water next to it, along with a bar of soap. You might also consider stocking up on a few bottles of hand sani- 88 085-100_U9037_06.indd 88 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"tizer. Although long-term use of these products can lead to some immune system issues (because the body grows accustomed to not having to fi ght off even the very minor bacteria and germs we encounter on any given day), they are just fi ne for short-term use. Bear in mind, though, that due to the alcohol used in them, a side effect is very dry skin. You might want to add a tube or three of moisturizing lotion to your survival supplies to help offset that problem. Bathing Options Unless you have a large source of reasonably clean and uncon- taminated water, you’ll be limited to sponge bathing to preserve your water supply. While not nearly as refreshing as immersion into a tub of just-shy-of-scalding water, it will still provide you with a decent level of cleanliness. Another water-saving option is to use baby wipes or body wipes. You could buy these in bulk on sale and keep them with your emergency supplies. If, and only if, you have a large source of uncontaminated water, such as several rain barrels or perhaps a pond nearby, there are a few different things you could do to provide for the means of bathing. The fi rst is to purchase and set up what is called a camp shower. You can fi nd these at almost any sporting goods store. It consists of a black plastic bag that you fi ll with water and hang from a tree or other support. Left in the sun for a while, the dark color absorbs the sun’s energy and heats the water. At the bottom of the bag is a short hose you use to pour water onto yourself. The water isn’t going to be steamy hot, of course, but warm is better than cold. Another option is to heat buckets of water over a fi re, then either pour them over yourself or have someone else do it for you. If you truly long for a “shower” effect, have them dump the water into a colander you or they hold over your head. If you have a large washtub, you could fi ll that with wa- ter and heat it before sitting down. I do not suggest building 89 085-100_U9037_06.indd 89 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"a fi re under the washtub as that could lead to burns. Instead, heat baseball-sized rocks in a fi re, use tongs to remove them and place them into the water. As the heat transfers from the rocks to the water, remove them and replace them with freshly warmed rocks. It won’t take too long for the water to reach a comfortable temperature. Warning: Place only dry rocks into the fi re. Wet rocks could explode in the fi re as the water inside any cracks in the rock turns to steam. Naturally, this all presupposes you’ve stocked up on bars of soap and a few bottles of shampoo. In a pinch, you can usually use bar soap to wash hair as well as skin, though it might lack that “full body” feel you’re used to, particularly if you have longer hair. Laundry While most of us have enough clothing in our dressers and clos- ets to last us at least a week or two, if the disaster is prolonged you will want to have a way to wash your clothes. For small- er items, such as socks and underwear, this could be done in a small bucket of water. The water need not be disinfected but the cleaner it is, the better. Add a bit of laundry detergent and scrub the clothing by hand, using a stiff brush for any ground-in dirt. Rinse the clothing well, wring out as much water as you can, and hang the clothing to dry. For bulkier items like shirts and jeans, a little mechanical help will be desired. Obtain a fi ve-gallon pail from a local res- taurant and wash it out. While you’re out getting the bucket, stop and purchase a new toilet plunger, the old-fashioned type with the big rubber dome on the working end. Using a sharp knife or a hole saw, cut a hole slightly larger than the size of the plunger handle in the center of the bucket lid. Use a razor knife or box cutter to cut four holes in the rubber end of the plunger. These holes should be about the size of a quarter and spaced evenly. To use this makeshift washing machine, fi ll the bucket about halfway with water and add detergent. Toss in a pair of 90 085-100_U9037_06.indd 90 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"jeans or a couple of shirts, then set the plunger into the bucket. Thread the plunger handle through the lid and clamp the lid on tight. Use the plunger to agitate the clothing in the bucket, mov- ing the handle up and down and side to side. Check the clothing periodically and when it has been cleaned, remove the clothing, wring it out, and rinse it well. Wring out the rinse water from the clothing, then hang the clothing to dry. Dental Care There are two very good reasons to make sure you plan ahead for taking care of your teeth after a disaster. First, you don’t want to worry about trying to fi nd a dentist to take care of a mouth infection following a disaster. Second, many potential crises will result in folks spending an awful lot of time together in close proximity. Put together a few folks who haven’t brushed their teeth in several days and the funk will be almost visible in the air. Make sure you have set aside at least one toothbrush, still in the package, for every member of the family. Add a few more, in case you end up with more people in the house than you’d origi- nally thought would show up. A couple extra tubes of toothpaste and some spare packages of dental fl oss are also recommended. Personally, I also like to have an extra bottle of good quality mouth rinse. Not only does it help to further cleanse the mouth and reduce possible bad breath, it can save you from having to use one more mouthful of precious water to rinse after brushing. MEDICAL AND FIRST AID In any disaster scenario, there are bound to be injuries, both small and large. Further, even if someone is in relatively decent health, stress and anxiety can suppress the immune system and leave that person susceptible to illness. Therefore, you’re going to want to stock up on at least a few basic medical supplies. The immediate aftermath of a disaster is a really bad time to need to run to the doctor or emergency room, if you can avoid it. 91 085-100_U9037_06.indd 91 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"However, all the medical gear in the world won’t help you if you don’t know what to do with it. Check with your local Red Cross offi ce (redcross.org) and see when they are next offering fi rst aid courses to the public. Failing that, get in touch with your local Boy Scout troop and fi nd out where they have been going for their fi rst aid training. If you have a career college or technical school in your area, check their website for course of- ferings for paramedics or emergency medical technicians. While pricier than the Red Cross courses, this EMT and paramedic training will have much more depth and information. WHAT SHOULD I HAVE IN A BASIC FIRST AID KIT? Protection From Biohazards One of the rules of fi rst aid is to protect yourself fi rst. What that means is to make sure you avoid infecting yourself with any pos- sible bloodborne pathogens or other nasty stuff as you render aid to the patient. With that in mind, pick up a box or two of nitrile gloves. Don’t get latex in case of allergies. You should also purchase at least one box of N95 masks. These are special masks that are rated to prevent more than 99 percent of bacteria and germs from getting through. They are a bit pricier than just basic surgical masks, but the added protection is important. In the event of a pandemic situation, these masks can help prevent you and your family from catching airborne disease. Bandages and Wound Care Your fi rst aid kit should contain items you’ll need to treat the most common types of injuries found during and after a disas- ter—lacerations, punctures, and bruises. Therefore, a top prior- ity is items to help with wound cleansing and dressing. You’ll want a bottle or two of hydrogen peroxide, rubbing alcohol, cotton swabs and balls, and a jug of purifi ed water. When pre- sented with an open wound, such as a cut, clean it out as best you can to prevent infection. 92 085-100_U9037_06.indd 92 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"After the wound is clean, you’ll need adhesive bandages, gauze pads, rolled gauze, and medical tape to dress the injury. The wound needs to be covered to prevent possible infection. The dressing on larger wounds will probably be changing multi- ple times a day, so you’ll be going through quite a few bandages for only a single injury. Stock up now to make sure you have plenty on hand and available to you. Consider tossing into the kit a package or two of generic, non-scented sanitary napkins. These work very well as a dressing for bleeding wounds as well as for padding when a wound needs to be splinted. Other items to include are: • thermometer, preferably an old-fashioned glass one. If you use a newer, electronic thermometer, be sure to have a backup non-battery powered one just in case. • irrigation syringe to help clean deep wounds • eye wash or saline solution to remove debris from eyes • small magnifying glass and tweezers to remove splinters and stingers • chemical ice packs for swelling injuries, whether from in- sect bites or bruising • antibiotic cream, such as Neosporin On top of all these supplies, have at least one good fi rst aid manual that clearly outlines step-by-step instructions on how to treat common injuries. In my opinion, one of the very best manuals available is The Survival Medicine Handbook: A Guide for When Medical Help is Not on the Way by Joseph Alton and Amy Alton. Over-the-Counter Medications There are several types of over-the-counter (OTC) medications you should keep with your fi rst aid supplies. Fever Reducers and Pain Relievers. Acetaminophen, ibupro- fen, and naproxen are the three most common ones.

Clove oil is another option for this situation. Anti-Diarrhea Medications. Many people experience an upset stomach when under stress. Not to mention, you run the risk of ingesting contaminated water or outdated food at some point during an emergency. Stock up anti-diarrhea medicines (brand names Imodium and Pepto-Bismol). Along these same lines, ant- acids are also a welcome addition. Prescription Medications We live in a day and age where it seems like almost everyone is taking a prescription medication for something. When prepar- ing for a disaster, the fi rst step is to determine which prescription medications are truly life-preserving. Concentrate on those fi rst, then work on the others. The goal is to have at least a full thirty-day supply of these medications on hand at all times. More would be better, of Should I Purchase a Suture Kit? Sutures are stitches that hold the sides of a wound together. You can buy suture kits that contain a needle and thread specially designed to stitch together skin, and this sort of product has become very popular among many preppers. However, owning the gear and having the skills necessary to use it are two different things. Just because you have a special needle and some thread, doesn’t mean you’ll auto- matically be able to stitch up any major wounds. The only time I’d recommend the purchase and use of such a product is if you’ve received training in how to properly suture a wound. Improperly closing a wound can introduce bacteria into the wound and then trap it in there to grow into a nasty and even potentially fatal infection. 94 085-100_U9037_06.indd 94 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"course, but a month supply is probably doable for most people. Explain to your doctor that you are concerned about the possi- bility of not being able to obtain a refi ll in the event of a weather emergency or other crisis. Thankfully, many physicians today understand the need for a backup supply of medications and are open to the idea, at least for meds that don’t fall under the narcotic label. Failing that, you can build up at least a small supply by refi lling your prescription as soon as it is available, commonly within a few days of when your current supply would run out. Doing this nets you, say, enough extra meds for two days. Al- ways take the oldest meds fi rst and never miss a dose . At the end of the next cycle, refi ll early again. Now you have enough for four days. Keep at this and you’ll slowly build up to a couple weeks and eventually a month. Diabetes and Insulin. If someone in your house has type 1 or type 2 diabetes, keep a supply of test strips as well as at least one backup test unit (with extra batteries) with your fi rst aid supplies. If you’re insulin-dependent, talk to your doctor about the need for a backup supply of insulin. To keep it fresh longer, insulin should be kept cool. This can be a problem when refrigeration isn’t working. Fortunately, there is a line of products produced by a company called FRIO (www.diabetesfrio.com). They make sev- eral different sized insulin wallets and carrying cases that, by sim- ply adding water, will keep insulin cool for long periods of time. CLIMATE CONTROL Mother Nature is a cruel mistress, often adding insult to injury. It is bad enough to have your town fl ood after torrential rains, but the days after are often fi lled with high temperatures and humidity so thick you can cut it with a knife. Blizzards are not usually followed by warm spring breezes either. In today’s modern world, we are accustomed to keeping interior temperatures at a certain level of comfort. But, when 95 085-100_U9037_06.indd 95 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"disasters strike, utilities are among the fi rst things to go, leaving us fending for ourselves when it comes to keeping warm or cool- ing off. For most of us, our comfort lies within a temperature range of about 65°F (18°C) to 80°F (27°C). If our world gets much above or below those temperatures, we are either seeking a sweater or we’re sweating. Even if we’re a bit uncomfortable, we can usually make it through for a day or two. However, when we start dealing with temperature extremes, we can begin to suffer some rather seri- ous health issues. Therefore, it is important to plan ahead for at least some primitive methods of climate control. HOW DO I KEEP WARM WHEN THE POWER’S OUT? Hypothermia is an emergency medical condition in which your body loses heat faster than it can generate it, with internal body temperatures falling to below 95°F (35°C). Symptoms of hypo- thermia include violent shivering, mental confusion, and labored movement. Contrary to popular belief, hypothermia doesn’t re- quire absolutely frigid temperatures to happen. Even relatively mild temperatures of around 50°F (10°C) could lead to health issues if the person isn’t properly dressed or has wet clothes. The fi rst line of defense, so to speak, is to stay indoors when the weather is cold. Even if the furnace isn’t running, you’ll be out of the wind and rain or snow. Fortunately, there are several means of keeping warm indoors if the utilities aren’t working. Extra Clothing and Blankets Most people likely have closets full of clothing suffi cient for dressing in layers. Now is not the time to wonder if the blue cable knit sweater goes with the wool trousers. Dressing in layers traps air between the clothing, which warms and insulates you. While it is something of an old wive’s tale that we lose the majority of our body heat through our heads, wearing a wool cap will help keep you warm. Having a few extra blankets stocked away in 96 085-100_U9037_06.indd 96 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"a closet is a great idea as well. Pile them on and pretend you’re having a slumber party. Huddling Up Speaking of slumber parties, try to keep everyone in the same room. Pair up and hudde together under blankets. The body heat will help a great deal with offsetting cold temperatures. Insulate the Room Cover windows with bubble wrap, blankets, or rigid insulation cut to fi t. If the room has tile or hardwood fl oors, cover them with blankets or throw rugs. Hang blankets over the doors and doorways. Since the furnace isn’t working, close off the vents in the room. All of this serves to insulate the room, keeping as much heat generated by your body inside the room and helping to prevent cold air from coming in from outside. Hand and Foot Warmers You can fi nd hand and foot warmers at many outdoor and sport- ing good stores. These small packets, when removed from the plastic wrapping and shaken, heat through a chemical reaction. They typically stay warm for at least a few hours. You can also fi nd battery-operated socks at many of the same stores. These will heat up when turned on. Candles and Lamps You may be surprised at just how much heat a few candles or a hurricane oil lamp can generate. Of course, you must be careful with any sort of open fl ame and ensure you have proper ventila- tion. Never go to sleep with candles or a lamp burning! Fireplaces Fireplaces are great for creating a romantic atmosphere but not so hot at keeping a room heated. Most of the heat generated 97 085-100_U9037_06.indd 97 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"by the fi re goes right up the chimney. However, that’s not to say they are utterly worthless. If you have a working fi replace, always keep a supply of wood on hand. (Don’t assume that just because you have a fi replace in your home it is safe to use. Have it properly inspected by an expert well before you might need to use it.) Huddling up next to a roaring fi re will indeed fi ght chilly nights. Never try to burn wood in a gas fi replace. Very bad things will happen as a result. KEEPING COOL Hyperthermia is, as the name suggests, the opposite of hypo- thermia. Rather than being too cold, the body is too warm. As the body absorbs or produces more heat than it can get rid of, the body’s internal temperature rises. This leads to hot, dry skin, nausea, low blood pressure, and ultimately unconsciousness and possibly death. Being too warm for long periods of time, even if it doesn’t rise to the level of heatstroke or hyperthermia, leads to exhaus- tion as the body wears itself out trying to cool down. This is particularly true when the temperatures don’t fall appreciably at night. The body is unable to rest suffi ciently in those conditions. There are, however, at least a few things you can do to help cool off when the air conditioning isn’t cooperating with you. Insulating Pipes During extreme cold, it is important to ensure that the pipes in your home don’t freeze. This happens most frequently with pipes that run along exterior walls and in unheated basements. Be sure the pipes are covered with foam insulation to help prevent freezing if the furnace goes out. You should also open kitchen and bathroom cabinets to let warm air get to those exposed pipes. Another thing you can do to prevent freezing pipes, as long as you have running water, is to let a trickle of water run through them overnight or when the temperatures truly plummet. While wasteful, this does work in many cases. 98 085-100_U9037_06.indd 98 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Limit Activity If there are chores or other things that absolutely must be done, try to get them handled in the early morning hours, before the sun heats up the day. Or, save them for late evening as things cool down a bit. Open Windows If you have windows that face away from the sun, open them in the morning or evening. Ideally, you’ll be able to open windows in a few different rooms, allowing for cross-ventilation. These breezes, while seemingly slight, can work wonders in cooling down the interior of the home. Spray Bottles You can fi nd an assortment of different spray bottles in the health and beauty department of most big box retailers. Fill them with water and spray the back of your neck, your chest, and face. The evaporation will help cool you down. Cold Packs Many fi rst aid kits include cold packs, which are activated by breaking a bubble inside the pack. While the intended purpose is for treating bruises and such, a cold pack placed on the wrist will cool you down rather well. Dress Appropriately Cotton fabrics are generally cooler than synthetics. Worn loose, they allow for evaporation of sweat, which helps you to cool down. SUMMARY Planning ahead for proper waste disposal as well as stockpil- ing necessary medical supplies are vitally important. If you or a family member becomes ill or injured, that will add stress to an already demanding situation. While matters of hygiene may 99 085-100_U9037_06.indd 99 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"seem on the surface to be more akin to luxuries than necessities, proper hygiene is directly related to overall health.

These ar- eas do deserve serious consideration but, at the same time, they aren’t necessarily any more important than planning for food and water. Proper disaster planning means all the components of the plan work together. Your security measures are there to protect your supplies, to ensure they are there when you need them. Your supplies, in turn, afford you the strength to imple- ment your defense plans. We need to fi rst look at the risks and threats we will need to defend against before determining the best ways to plan those defenses. SECURITY THREATS IN URBAN AREAS Sad as it is to say, the fi rst risk you may face after a disaster will be the people surrounding you. If they have any reason to believe you have more food, more water, more anything than they have, you can count on them knocking on your door. Sure, they may fi rst try to prey upon your sense of friendship and compassion. Sooner rather than later, though, those gentle inquiries may turn to incessant pleading. As desperation sets in, pleading will turn to outright taking, through violence if they feel it necessary. 101 101-115_U9037_07.indd 101 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"On top of neighbors and friends, there will almost certainly be those who try to take advantage of the general lack of law and order. These are the type of people we often see in disaster news footage, looting stores and generally causing trouble wher- ever they go. You need to plan ahead for the possibility that their travels will take them to your neighborhood at some point. There is also a possible risk from authority fi gures. It would not be unheard of for those who are in charge to decide they need to confi scate “hoarded” supplies to redistribute them to those in need. While humanitarian on the surface, by and large these sorts of programs do little to truly help anyone other than those who run the programs. AVOID BEING A TARGET First and foremost, do what you can to not let on that you are prepping for anything. This is what we call operations securi- ty, or OPSEC. If you come across an incredible deal on canned goods and buy a rather large quantity, don’t ask your neighbor to help you lug the six cases in from your car. Try as you might to come up with some plausible reason for buying it, odds are pretty good that he or she will remember those canned goods if the grid goes down and they are looking to feed their family. Similarly, don’t leave umpteen cases of water cluttering up every corner of your apartment. Not only is this unsafe and not all that pleasing to the eye, casual visits from neighbors will re- sult in them knowing just where to head when they get thirsty. Do what you can to keep your preps under wraps. If you live in an apartment with a basement storage area, hide your goodies in boxes or under blankets. Use the back of closets or the space under beds. Your hiding spaces may not hold up under a thor- ough, diligent search, but if you can keep people from thinking you have supplies stashed to begin with, that’s half the battle. After a disaster, it’s important to not let on that you are any better off than anyone else. Dispose of your food wrappers by 102 101-115_U9037_07.indd 102 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"burning or burying them rather than letting bags of them pile up outside. Keep your shades drawn to prevent casual (or maybe not so casual) peeks inside. Purchase a few rolls of landscape fabric. Use it to cover the inside of any windows you don’t end up boarding over (more on that in a bit). The fabric works very well at preventing light from shining through, which helps keep people from seeing in at night. The bonus is that the fabric has tons of little, tiny holes that you can use to see out of as needed. If some sort of aid becomes available, such as a soup kitch- en, don’t be the only person in the neighborhood who doesn’t show up. I know that seems wrong, in that if you have enough for you and your family, let the donated stuff go to those who really need it. But, who’s to say that aid will last throughout the duration of the crisis? It might be that those meals allow you to extend your own supplies until such time that you’re back on your feet. If it makes you feel any better, perhaps you can fi gure out a safe way to donate a bit back to the aid providers. This extends beyond food, too. If you are the only one around with clean hair, a scrubbed face, and freshly laundered clothing, you’re going to stick out like a shiny penny. Remember, for most people, perception is reality. Avoid doing anything at all that will cause you to stick out from the crowd. In every way possible, you want to just blend in. Would it be a good idea to make my home look abandoned? The problem with this approach is it will only work on people who don’t already know you are there. Your neighbors won’t be fooled since they will likely still see you there, day after day. So, while there are some experts out there who advocate painting your home to look as though it is nothing more than a burned out hulk, I disagree. Remember when we talked earlier about the most likely risks you have to security? While looters may show up, it is those who live closest to you that pose the biggest threat. 103 101-115_U9037_07.indd 103 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"What about tagging my home so it looks like FEMA has already searched it? This is another idea I’ve seen fl oating around the various survival message boards and other sites online. FEMA and other disaster response agencies utilize a code of sorts that they paint on the door or outer wall of a dwelling after it has been searched. It com- monly looks like a large X, with symbols or numbers surrounding it. The information communicated by these symbols includes the date and time of the search, the team that did the search, and what was found during the search. There are some variations to the code but for our purposes, that explanation will suffi ce. On the surface, it sounds like an interesting approach to camoufl age in that it would seem to indicate there’s no need for anyone to enter the building. The problems, though, are two- fold. First, the presence of such a code on a building might actu- ally attract looters, who assume the building is truly abandoned. This could invite more trouble than it is worth. Second, those who legitimately use those codes know the teams work in more or less logical order. Spotting a dwelling in the middle of the block that has already been tagged might raise suspicion. SECURITY PLANNING Try to think of security in terms of layers, like an onion. At a minimum, there should be three layers to your security plan— perimeter defense, structure hardening, and personal space. What is perimeter defense? Your perimeter is the area extending from the walls of your home, going outward as far as you can reasonably view. For some, that means their front and back yards, from the sidewalk in front to the lot line in back. For others, this might only realistically include the small courtyard in front of their building and the alley at the rear. The idea behind perimeter defense is to provide you with something of a cushion. The perimeter should be seen as sort 104 101-115_U9037_07.indd 104 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"of a no man’s land, where you have the opportunity to dissuade visitors before they are on your doorstep. A key element to security is time. You want to do everything you can to decrease the amount of time someone could be in your perimeter before you become aware of them. Conversely, this means that the earlier you detect their presence, the more time afforded to you to take whatever steps you deem necessary to protect you and yours. How can I best defend my perimeter? Perimeter defense starts with early warning systems, also known as alarms. Remember, not every single human being who strays into your perimeter is necessarily a “bad guy.” Therefore, while your fi rst instinct might be to load the perimeter with man-killing traps, that might not be the best idea, particularly given that once law and order are re-established, there might be questions about what all occurred in your area. Don’t get me wrong, there are times when you may need to take decidedly serious action against possible intruders, but that might not necessarily be your fi rst line of defense. Given that the likelihood of a power outage being part of the overall disaster, relying upon alarms that run on electricity is not the best plan. Fortunately, there are at least a few low-tech approaches you can take. Trip wires have been used for ages and for good reason. Even with all our technology, they still work fairly well. Just a single strand of fi shing line or other very thin cordage can pro- vide you with a heads up to potential trouble. Run the trip wire across a likely route to your home, such as in an alley or even an apartment building hallway. It doesn’t even need to be in a loca- tion where it would actually be tripped upon by someone. This sort of alarm trigger works very well if it is just attached to some small obstacle. The intruder moves the obstacle, say a couple of empty cardboard boxes, and this causes the alarm to sound. 105 101-115_U9037_07.indd 105 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"The alarm itself could be nothing more than a bunch of empty cans, fi lled with some pebbles and stacked precariously. The trip wire pulls on the bottom can, causing the stack to fall and make noise. You could rig up a variation of a trip wire on the exterior door of your building, too. Screw a small eye-bolt into the bottom of the door on the inside. Tie one end of the trip wire to a small hook and attach the other end to your alarm. Hook the line on the eye- bolt and if someone pulls open the door, they set off the alarm. One trip wire alarm that I’m familiar with and would read- ily recommend is the Brite-Strike Camp Alert Perimeter Security System. It consists of a small plastic unit, roughly three inches long and one inch wide. On one end of the unit is a metal pin with a loop attached to it. The unit is attached to a wall or other stable object and the trip wire attached to the pin. When the pin is pulled by someone hitting the trip wire, the unit emits a 135 decibel alarm. This is just a bit quieter than a jet engine at a distance of 100 feet. The cost of the Brite-Strike Camp Alert Perimeter Security System is about forty dollars. You can fi nd it online at brite-strike.com. What about booby traps? Again, avoid using anything that causes injury unless it truly is a societal collapse situation. It makes very little sense to manage to survive a disaster to only lose everything in a later lawsuit fi led because of the guy you killed in your front lawn whose only crime was trying to shortcut his own trip home. That said, there are some things you can set up that will do well toward dissuading repeat visits from certain sorts of people. One of the fi rst things you want to do is determine the best locations for traps. Typically, these are going to be places where you don’t want people going, such as places it would be easy for them to hide. Let’s say you have a detached garage and you want to make sure people aren’t able to just hunker down behind it as 106 101-115_U9037_07.indd 106 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"they approach your house. The fi rst idea that comes to mind is to plant hawthorn shrubs along that wall. They are rather pret- ty, so they actually could add curb appeal. They also have thorns that are like needles a few inches long. Very sharp and painful. Then again, something like that might not really qualify as a “booby trap,” right? How about running plywood down on the ground along the wall, plywood that is covered in nails a few inches long, with the points coming straight up into the feet? Toss some dead leaves and such over it and no one will be the wiser. It has the added bonus of acting as an alarm as you’re sure to hear the painful shouts of the fi rst person to step on the nails. STRUCTURE HARDENING The next part of defense planning involves strengthening the home itself. All your defense planning is for naught if someone is able to just walk in the front door or easily climb in a window. How do I strengthen doors? This starts by examining the exterior doors themselves. Ideally, they are solid wood or perhaps even covered in metal. The best locks in the world do you no good if the door is hollow-core and easily smashed in. If there is a window in the door, it should be small and far enough from the doorknob that one can’t reach it easily from the window. Should your current doors not meet these guidelines, replace them if possible. If there is a large window in the door and you are unable or unwilling to replace the door, purchase a piece of ½-inch ply- wood that is cut to fi t over the window. You want at least a couple inches of overlap on all sides. Then, if the time comes that you need to secure the door, use wood screws to attach the plywood over the window (on the inside of the door, not the outside). It isn’t a perfect solution, but better than nothing. When you purchase that plywood, add to your cart a couple lengths of 2×4 or 2×6 that are long enough to stretch across the 107 101-115_U9037_07.indd 107 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"door. Use wood screws or lag bolts to attach these boards to the doorframe, going across the door, making sure the screws go into studs and not just drywall or trim pieces. This isn’t something you’d do every day but rather something you’d put into place in the event of a major event. You can store this lumber in the back of a closet, along with the screws and a cordless drill, until you need it. Be sure the drill is plugged in so it keeps a charge until the time comes. Bear in mind, this is a fairly permanent security measure and it would prevent you from escaping through that door quickly in the event of a fi re or other emergency. Replace the hinge screws on the door. Typically, doors are installed using very short screws that do little more than support the weight of the door. Purchase wood screws that are about three inches long and replace each of the hinge screws, one by one. Every exterior door should have a good quality lock and deadbolt. Be sure the deadbolt extends at least an inch into the doorframe when it's thrown. Get in the habit of locking the deadbolt every time you leave home and when you head to bed. How do I secure windows? Windows get tricky in that you don’t want to hamper your own vision to the point that you can’t see what’s coming your way. But, at the same time, windows can provide easy access to your home unless you take precautions. Depending on the nature of the disaster, you might consider installing plywood over the windows, just as we described for the window in your front door. Doing so, however, will obviously compromise your visibility. Another option, and this is some- thing you’d need to do well in advance, is to replace the glass in your windows with Lexan or another product that is much harder to break than glass but will not hinder your visibility. If you go with the latter suggestion, still be sure to install good quality locks on all windows or, in a pinch, use nails or screws to close them permanently. 108 101-115_U9037_07.indd 108 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"While we’re on the subject of windows, you should consider purchasing a roll or two of landscape fabric from a garden cen- ter. Tacking this over the inside of your windows prevents prying eyes from seeing into your home. It also keeps light in the room from shining to the outside. This can be important if you are the only person on the block who thought ahead and invested in candles or lanterns. The best part about using landscape fabric for this purpose is if you place your eyes very close to the fabric, you’ll be able to see through the tiny holes in it. Should I have a safe room? Safe rooms have become fairly common in the last several years, at least among the more fi nancially secure segments of the popu- lation. The basic idea is to have a room within the home into which you and your family can retreat in the face of an intruder. The problem is that most plans of this sort rely upon some sort of rescue by law enforcement. In the wake of a disaster, such as- sistance might not be coming. However, it still isn’t the worst idea to have a room from which you can either make a stand or make your escape. Most commonly, safe rooms are located in bedrooms. Pick one bed- room, often the master, and give thought to how you can aug- ment the security of it. First and foremost, it should have some means of egress to the outside. The last thing you want is to corner yourself. If you are on an upper fl oor of the building, you could use the fi re escape or maybe purchase a folding ladder that is precisely made for this purpose. Next, the door, which is likely of the hollow-core variety, should be replaced with something solid. Install a good quality lock, which not only helps prevent intruders but also inadver- tent visits from the kids when you might otherwise be occupied. Finally, you should have a stash of weapons inside the room, with which you can defend you and yours. 109 101-115_U9037_07.indd 109 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"PERSONAL SPACE DEFENSE When we talk about personal space, we’re referring to threats that are up close and personal. The intruder has gotten through the perimeter and is inside your home, looking to harm you and your family. You have no doubt that if action isn’t taken, harm will befall your loved ones. The gloves need to come off. Personal Defense Weapons If you are able to legally own a fi rearm, get one. If you’re not already familiar with shooting, take the appropriate classes. The store where you purchase the fi rearm should be able to recom- mend gun safety and shooting classes in your area. The fact is, if someone forces their way into your home, they aren’t likely going to have fl owers in their hand. They are going to be armed and probably desperate enough to not think awfully hard about whether they truly want to pull the trigger. To a large degree, the type of fi rearm you choose is a matter of personal preference. The gun should fi t your hand and you should feel comfortable fi ring it. For matters of personal defense in an urban setting, hand- guns and shotguns are going to rank higher than deer rifl es. Carbines, which are basically shortened rifl es, are also great for urban environments, but they carry a higher price tag. Shotguns. A decent 12-gauge shotgun purchased used will run you a couple hundred dollars in most areas. As such, this is the fi rst fi rearm I suggest if you are just beginning to put to- gether your defensive armory. Use shot shells for ammunition and avoid using slugs. Shot shells won’t go through your target and into the next room the way a slug will. It isn’t only the price tag that puts shotguns at the top of the list. They are somewhat forgiving when it comes to accuracy. Shot shells are loaded with a quantity of small pellets. As they leave the barrel, they begin to spread out. This means you could be a bit off the mark and still hit your target with at least some 110 101-115_U9037_07.indd 110 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"of the pellets. Plus, there are few sounds as chilling as that of a shell being racked in a shotgun. Handguns. Handguns come in two basic models—revolver and semi-automatic. You might remember revolvers from cow- boy movies. They have a circular chamber called the cylinder that holds the bullets. As the gun is fi red, the cylinder rotates a new shell into fi ring position. Revolvers are less complicated to use than semi-automatics so I often suggest them as a fi rst- time handgun. The downside is most revolvers will only hold six shells at a time. This means you’ll be reloading more often. Semi-automatic handguns are more modern, using a maga- zine to hold the shells rather than a cylinder. Most law enforce- ment offi cers and other professionals use semi-autos rather than revolvers. The magazines hold up to about seventeen rounds, depending on the caliber. This obviously gives you more shots before the need to reload. However, semi-autos are generally more expensive than revolvers. They are also a bit more compli- cated, though easy enough to learn how to use. As for calibers, stick with ones that are commonly available, such as .357 or .38 for revolvers and .40, .45, or 9mm for semi- autos. Stock up on as much ammunition as you can afford. Don’t forget cleaning kits and supplies and learn how to use them to keep your fi rearms in good, working condition at all times. Carbines. As I mentioned earlier, carbines are the most ex- pensive guns on our fi rearms list. These are the sometimes- dreaded “black guns” that look like they belong in the military. The AR-15 is one of the most popular models. It is dependable and will also run you upwards of several hundred dollars and the ammunition isn’t cheap either. Non-Lethal Weapons. Pepper spray gets my vote for the fi rst non-lethal weapon on the list. Used properly, it is truly debili- tating and will certainly give you time to take further action, whether that be to run away or go on the offensive. Look for varieties that shoot a stream rather than a spray or cloud. A 111 101-115_U9037_07.indd 111 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"stream of liquid is far easier to aim and there’s less chance of an errant breeze sending it right back into your face. Wasp and hornet spray also works well in a pinch. There are also defensive weapons that utilize electricity to disable an attacker. Stun guns work well, provided you make contact with bare skin. They don’t do much through heavy clothing. This means you’ll have to be within arm’s reach of your attacker, which isn’t a great place to be. However, using a stun gun sure beats trying to remember exactly where that magic spot is on their neck that Spock was able to grab and knock someone out. Be sure to check your local laws and be sure you can legally own and carry such a weapon. Improvised Weapons. There are many common household items that could be used as weapons should the need arise. Base- ball bats come immediately to mind. While they aren’t suited for The 9mm Taurus PT92 is just one of the many handgun options suitable for urban preppers. 112 101-115_U9037_07.indd 112 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"tight quarters, one good swing will be enough to put an attacker down for the count. A swat in the head with a heavy frying pan will also work well. A so-called “oldie but a goodie” is to put a fi st-sized rock into a sweat sock. You hold the open end of the sock and swing the weighted end at an attacker. If for some reason you lack a rock, you can use a few C- or D-size batteries or a can of vegetables. I hesitate to suggest using kitchen knives as weapons, simply because if you attempt to use a blade as a weapon, odds are good you will also end up getting cut during the attack. But, with that said, fear of being cut by a brandished knife may be enough to send your attacker off to seek an easier target. A very bright fl ashlight, such as the 200-plus lumens Quark Tactical QT2A by Foursevens, will certainly dazzle an attacker’s eyes, giving you time to retreat or smack him over the head with something heavy. This approach should not be a fi rst line of de- fense, but it is worth keeping in mind as a backup. Martial Arts Training Learning a martial art is a great way to not only add to your self-defense arsenal but get in shape. That said, avoid the arts that stress high-fl ying kicks or other non-practical moves. You want an art that will teach you to put an attacker on the ground quickly, without risking undue injury to yourself. Among the arts with which I’m familiar and would recom- mend are Krav Maga, Jeet Kune Do, Ninjutsu, and Eskrima. Each of those will teach students very practical self-defense skills without necessitating a decade of learning before anything ap- proaching profi ciency sets in. SAFETY IN NUMBERS We live in a rather unique point in social development. We are more globally connected than at any other point in history. Yet, at the same time, we are more disconnected on a personal level 113 101-115_U9037_07.indd 113 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"than ever before. On a daily basis, we might chat with a friend on another continent, yet we don’t know the names of the peo- ple who live right next door. It is important to get to know your neighbors, particularly in an urban or suburban setting. You need not become best bud- dies with everyone in your building, but you should do what you can to at least learn their faces and names. If nothing else, this will help you notice strangers in the area after a disaster strikes. If the opportunity presents itself, encourage your neighbors to engage in some prepping themselves. I’m not suggesting you invite them over for a tour of your disaster supply closet, but ev- ery person who has his or her own extra supplies is one less per- son who is likely to knock on your door looking for a handout. There is safety in numbers, of course. By networking with your neighbors and getting to know them, you can begin to rec- ognize strengths they have which you may lack. For example, you may be fearful of fi rearms and hesitant about owning one, but your neighbor is a lifetime member of the NRA and has ex- pressed numerous times his or her strong dislike of thieves. On top of that aspect, despite what the media likes to portray, many human beings do tend to try and help one another during a cri- sis. Not all, of course, but quite a few will do whatever they can to help their fellow man or woman. This is helped dramatically if the people actually know one another. You could also go a step further and look toward setting up a Mutual Assistance Group (MAG). This is a group of people who have committed to working together in the event of a disas- ter or other emergency. A MAG is not something that is formed overnight, but takes time and effort to create and maintain. An excellent resource for creating a MAG is MAGS: The People Part of Prepping by Charley Hogwood. Not all members of your MAG will necessarily live in your building or even on your block. But, most if not all of them will reside close enough that you can rely on them for help, just as they will rely upon you. 114 101-115_U9037_07.indd 114 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"SUMMARY In an urban or suburban area, security is of utmost importance. All the food and water in the world will do you no good if some- one can easily take it from you. People often change in the after- math of disasters, particularly if they become hungry and have no way of easily obtaining food. Sometimes, they begin to engage in behavior they’d have never considered during “normal” times, such as becoming violent toward other people.

Just grabbing a bag and heading for the hills will likely make you nothing more than just another refugee. If you’ve followed the earlier instructions in this book, you’ve made plans for sheltering in place by storing food and water and securing your home. Now it’s time to make a plan for how you will leave your home because of a disaster—how you will bug out. These plans include determining when to bug out, where to go, how to get there, and what to bring. WHEN IS IT TIME TO BUG OUT? This is one of the most common questions both new and expe- rienced preppers ask me. It is also one of the most diffi cult to answer, as every circumstance is different. What might be advis- able for one person might not be feasible for another. For those who live in areas with a high population density, it is critical to identify when to hit the road so as to avoid getting caught up in the crowd. 116 116-145_U9037_08.indd 116 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Part of the diffi culty in making the decision to bug out is that the true scope of the disaster at hand might not be easily determined right away. What at fi rst appears to be merely a small bump in the road may turn out to be a vast mountain of chaos and confusion. Here, then, are a few red fl ags you should look for in the wake of a catastrophe. Seeing one or more of these should be a strong indicator that it is time to head for greener pastures. Stores Aren’t Receiving New Stock Almost all retail stores, especially supermarkets and big box dis- count stores, rely on what is called “Just In Time” inventory systems. Basically, everything runs by a computer system that automatically orders product as it sells. This translates to the stores needing much less stockroom space than they did a de- cade ago. Just about every item they have on hand is displayed on the sales fl oor. This is a great system as far as profi tability is concerned, as long as the system is working properly. You’ve probably seen, either fi rst-hand or on a news broad- cast, store shelves being emptied in anticipation of a coming storm. It happens all the time, right? However, within a day or two of the roads being clear enough for the trucks to roll, those shelves are restocked and all is well. What if, though, the trucks aren’t coming any time soon? The longer those shelves remain bare, the more skittish people are going to get. We live in an era of immediate gratifi cation. Generally speaking, if we want something, we want it right now and we get upset if something prevents us from having it. Eyewitness Accounts of Looting If you hear from a reliable source that people have been seen in the area going to homes and businesses, breaking in, and mak- ing off with food and such, it is high time for you to hit the trail. However, I want to stress the “eyewitness” part of this. In the aftermath of a disaster, rumors run rampant. Think back to all 117 116-145_U9037_08.indd 117 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"the nasty stories we heard about what went on in the Superdome after Hurricane Katrina. While there is no doubt it was not a fun place to be, as far as I know there is no actual documented proof that any infants were killed, despite how prevalent that particular story came to be. It is one thing to have a neighbor come and tell you they saw looting taking place as they were scouting the area. It is another thing entirely for that neighbor to tell you they heard from a guy down the street who said their cousin talked to a friend whose uncle heard there was looting going in a neighboring suburb. When at all possible, you want to act on real, hard information rather than rumors and conjecture. Emergency Services Are Overwhelmed or Unresponsive This is no complaint or accusation against emergency services like law enforcement and fi re departments, but the fact is that major disasters can quickly overwhelm their capabilities. Thou- sands and thousands of great men and women work in those and related fi elds and they work very hard doing a very diffi cult job. But, they are only human and they have limits. They cannot be in two places at once and there are only so many of them to go around. At some point, if the disaster is too large to handle, triage is going to take place. They will have to make some very hard decisions as to which emergencies they have to just let sit while responding to others. Of course, this happens even today. Police and fi re dispatch- ers must constantly decide which calls should receive priority. For example, a multiple vehicle crash with injuries is going to take precedence over a backyard campfi re out of season and without a permit. Added to this, in the wake of a catastrophe, staffi ng levels at these emergency service departments might be at less than 100 percent. Offi cers may have been injured in the disaster, some may become ill, and a few might decide to call in so they can 118 116-145_U9037_08.indd 118 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"stay home and provide for their own family’s needs. Again, they are just as human as the rest of us. Even if there are no vacancies during roll call, as we said before, the magnitude of the disaster may still overwhelm the capabilities of the responding agencies. Should that happen, you really don’t want to be the guy or gal standing on their front lawn, patiently waiting for a squad car to arrive and resolve a problem for you. Follow Your Instincts Above all else, when it comes to deciding whether it is time to bug out or not, trust your gut. You may only have one chance, one window of opportunity, to get out ahead of everyone and make it to your chosen bug-out location rather than end up in the middle of an interstate that has become nothing more than a massive parking lot. WHERE DO I GO WHEN I BUG OUT? Without a planned destination in mind, bugging out simply makes you one more refugee on the roads. Ideally, you should have multiple locations available to you, each in a different di- rection. This gives you options. If, let’s say, the only bug-out location you have set up is to the north, and all routes that way are now several feet underwater, then what? For example, you might have Grandpa’s old cabin about seventy-fi ve miles to the north, your college roommate’s suburban home forty miles to the west, and your Aunt Patty’s hobby farm sixty miles to the east. Of course, you should have conversations with each of those people well in advance, hashing out an agreement that you are invited to head there in the event of a disaster. The last thing you want to happen is to endure a journey of possibly a few weeks or more, only to be told upon arrival that you’re not welcome and to hit the road. 119 116-145_U9037_08.indd 119 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Distance to Bug-Out Location As you consider your options for bug-out locations, one of the fi rst things to consider is distance. It may turn out that you end up traveling some, perhaps all, of your journey on foot. With that in mind, having a destination a few hundred miles or more away just isn’t going to be feasible for most people. On the other hand, unless the disaster is very localized, you are going to want a bug-out location that is farther than just the next block over. On average, look for places that are, at most, seventy to one hundred miles away. Any distances farther than that are going to be unrealistic for most folks. This distance also takes into ac- count the fact that most people don’t top off their gas tanks as often as perhaps they should. Modern vehicles can usually travel around one hundred miles on a quarter tank of gas. Less-Populated, But Not Remote In addition to distance, you want to avoid a situation where you’d be going from the proverbial frying pan into the fi re. If you live in a very urban area and plan to bug out to another nearby urban area, you might not be doing yourself any favors. In an ideal world, you’d have at least one if not multiple bug-out locations that are away from high population areas. Naturally, that isn’t always possible for everyone, but that’s the goal for which you should be striving. You may notice that I’ve not mentioned the idea of bugging out to a large state forest area or some place else along those lines. Having the idea of just heading for the hills to live off the land isn’t a realistic option for the vast majority of people. While I know several people who possess the necessary skill sets to possibly pull that off, every single one of them would agree that such a plan is a last-ditch effort. Sure, part of your bug-out journey might entail living in the rough for a few nights. Hope- fully, though, that will just be temporary as you move ever closer to your destination. 120 116-145_U9037_08.indd 120 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Stocking the Bug-Out Locations After you select your bug-out location, you need to stock those locations with survival supplies. Few of us can afford to have duplicates or triplicates of everything, but you want to have at least some supplies stocked at each bug-out location. Sure, you will be bringing some supplies in your bug-out bag, but you can- not possibly expect to carry with you everything you’d need for an extended time period. At an absolute minimum, each bug-out location should have enough food and water to last everyone who intends to shelter there for a few weeks. After you make an agreement with friends and/or relatives to use their homes as bug-out locations (and you must be willing to reciprocate, a mutual aid agreement is the best for this arrangement), put together a few boxes of survival supplies, particularly food and water, for them to stash for you. Important Documents In addition to the very basics of food and water, you should also keep copies of im- portant documents at each of your bug-out locations. In recent years, particularly after Hurricane Katrina, it has become evident that having copies of your insurance policies and identifi cation will go a long way toward expediting any claims. There- fore, make a complete copy of each of these documents and have them stored with your supplies at each bug-out location: • identifi cation—driver’s license or state identifi cation card • all insurance policies—home, auto, life • property ownership records—house deeds, vehicle titles You might also consider including a summary of your fi nancial records, such as bank accounts, credit cards, 401(k) statements, and information relating to other accounts you may hold. If your records are destroyed in some way, having backup copies can speed things along when it comes to accessing those accounts. Finally, consider including copies of treasured family photos with your documents. Go through your albums and pull out the photos that you’d be truly devastated if you lost. Scan them into a computer and save copies of the digital fi les on fl ash drives. 121 116-145_U9037_08.indd 121 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"I realize that in a perfect world, they’d already have enough food and such on hand to account for your needs on at least a tem- porary basis. Reality, though, has a nasty habit of taking such assumptions and casting them onto the rocks from a high cliff. You might go so far as to include a few sets of clothing for each family member, sleeping bags, toiletry kits, some cash, and other basic necessities in your bug-out location survival kit. Think along the lines of having to stay at a motel for a few nights and plan accordingly. HOW DO I GET TO MY BUG-OUT LOCATION? After you have your bug-out locations sorted out, the next step is to plan for how you will get to each of them. The best-case scenario, provided the disaster damage doesn’t preclude it, is that you’ll be able to just hop in the family car and go for a drive. That said, take the time to plan multiple routes to each bug-out location. You might fi nd your normal route is closed or impass- able due to disaster-related damage or fl ooding and when that happens, you’ll feel better already knowing an alternate route you can take. Remember, if not much time has passed since the disaster hit, road crews may not be out posting detour signs just yet. Purchase (or print from an online source) a detailed map of the area. Use this to help map out several different routes to your destinations. Do not mark these routes on the map, though. While it sounds a bit paranoid, if the map were lost or taken from you, someone else might end up visiting your bug-out locations. Include the map in your bug-out bag as GPS as cell phones may not work following a disaster. A compass will be benefi cial as well, provided you take the time to learn how to properly use it. Multiple routes also let you avoid concentrations of people. If the people are stranded in their area and yours is the fi rst work- ing minivan they’ve seen in a few days, they might want to take it for a drive themselves. During your bug out you want to avoid making new friends if at all possible.Keep in mind, too, what 122 116-145_U9037_08.indd 122 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"we talked about regarding the government’s typical responses to disasters. In many situations it’s likely that the government will cordon off some areas of the city, close down roads, perhaps even staff checkpoints in some areas to prevent non-residents from going in to loot and pillage. Know the emergency plans the city has in place so you can plan ways to get around those obstacles. Hollywood and novelists have convinced many people that climbing down through any random manhole gives them access to a wonderful world of underground sewer systems, subway tunnels, and other ways to get around the city without being seen. The reality is, well, this is just an insanely bad idea unless you are somehow very knowledgeable about such systems in your city. If you’re not, stay out of them. Instead of fi nding a way out, you’ll fi nd poisonous gases, raw sewage, and vermin— all are not to be trifl ed with. The Bug-Out Bicycle A bug-out bicycle is an option more and more people are exploring. Personally, I think it is a great idea. Using a bike to get to your bug-out location will be faster than walking. It also requires no fuel source and can go off road much easier than a motor vehicle. Visit your local bike shop and you might be surprised at the wide range of packs and accessories that are available to help you transport a rather sizeable collection of gear on a single bike. Keep in mind, though, that you’ll be the one feeling every ounce of that added weight as you go up hills. Don’t overdo it and try to pack everything, including the kitchen sink. You can often pick up a decent bike rather cheaply at rummage sales. Before buying a used bike, be sure to inspect it thoroughly. Make sure the chain is tight and everything works smoothly. Along with the food and survival gear you pack, include a few extra tire tubes and a tube repair kit. A small tire pump that attaches to the bike frame is also a wise investment. I’ve equipped a used bike and store it in a small storage area in the basement where I work. If for some reason I’m unable to drive my car home, I have the bike as my backup. 123 116-145_U9037_08.indd 123 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Traveling by Foot Of course, as I mentioned earlier in this chapter, you should also plan for the contingency that you might end up on foot for at least part of your journey. Given that none of us have any way of positively knowing exactly what might befall us, it is bet- ter to plan ahead for this potential eventuality. This planning starts with those routes you identifi ed earlier. If you are on foot, you aren’t necessarily limited to roads and can instead travel in straighter lines. For example, if you have large state or national parks along the way, instead of driving around them, you might be able to walk straight through, more or less. We’ll talk about bug-out bags and other survival kits in a bit, but let me get this out of the way now. You should always have good footwear available to you. What I mean by this is, if you work in an environment that requires you to wear dress shoes, you should have a good, broken-in pair of hiking boots or, at the very least, comfortable walking shoes, stashed with your gear in the car or at your workstation. Think back to the news footage of people in New York City fl eeing the destruction at the World Trade Center on 9/11. Most of them were wearing suits, dresses, and the like. Many of them faced a long walk home in high heels or slick-soled shoes because public transportation was closed, roads and bridges were closed, and cars had to be left behind in the rush to get away. Being on foot, while slower than a vehicle, also affords you the advantage of concealment. It is much easier to duck down a side alley and make your way to the next block over when you don’t have to worry about whether your car will fi t past the dumpsters. WHAT TO CARRY WITH YOU IN A BUG OUT? The bug-out bag is a core element of your overall plan. In its purest form, the bug-out bag is simply a collection of supplies to get you from Point A to Point B. If you are a student of his- tory, you’ll fi nd that many cultures had their own versions of 124 116-145_U9037_08.indd 124 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"these portable survival kits. The famous mountain men of the American Old West called them “possibles bags.” Going back about 5,000 years earlier, we have Ötzi, the so-called Iceman, whose well-preserved body was discovered in glacial ice in the Ötztal Alps in 1991. He was found to be well dressed against the weather for his trek through the mountains and he was carrying a small survival kit that contained things like fl int tools and a bone awl, as well as tinder for making a fi re. While bug-out bags are far from a modern invention, we’ve come a long way from a rawhide pouch carrying dried moss. Today, we can take full ad- vantage of modern technology that will allow us to carry more without adding undue weight. I can’t emphasize enough that you should plan for the possibility that you’ll be carrying the bug-out bag on your back, rather than having it sit in your vehicle’s trunk until you arrive at your destination. That being the case, you need to pay close attention to every single ounce you add. Your bug-out bag should contain items that will provide for your basic needs during the time you are on the road. These needs include: • water • food • shelter and fi re • fi rst aid and hygiene • light • security • navigation It sounds like a lot, I know. But, let’s go through each category and talk about what should be in your bug-out bag for each need. Water Despite how essential water is to life, you simply can’t expect to carry several gallons of it. At about eight pounds per gallon, it is just too heavy to carry in bulk. Instead, plan to carry some water with you as well as the means to fi lter and purify more. 125 116-145_U9037_08.indd 125 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Most people can comfortably carry about two liters of wa- ter. Break this up into two separate one-liter bottles. This way, after you empty the fi rst one, you can refi ll it with water you fi nd and purify it while still having the other bottle to quench your thirst immediately if need be. There are many ways to fi lter and purify water out in the fi eld. Some of the methods were discussed in chapter four, while certainly doable on the road, just aren’t too practical. Boiling, for example, is great if you have the time to wait as well as a suitable container in which to boil the water. Solar disinfection (SODIS) takes at least a day under optimal conditions. When bugging out, speed is of the essence. You want to get from your home to your bug-out location as fast as is safe and practical. Water Purifi cation Tablets Carrying a supply of water purifi ca- tion tablets is one excellent way to provide for potable water on the road. These tablets remain viable for about one year after opening the bottle and they are readily available in the camping section of big box stores and outdoor retailers. Be sure the bottle of tablets is marked prominently with the appropriate dosage, such as two tablets per quart of water. Helpful tip: One U.S. quart is just a hair more than one liter. The difference between the two is negligible. Mechanical Filter Systems Another option is to pack in your bug-out bag any one of a variety of available mechanical water fi lter systems. Examples include water bottles with built-in fi lters as well as straws with the same capability. Berkey is one of the most popular manufacturers of such fi ltration products and for good reason. While pricey, their products work very well. Other manufacturers include Aquamira, Katadyn, LifeStraw, and MSR. Whether you use chemical or mechanical means to provide potable water, it is always a good idea to pre-fi lter the water. This is as simple as pouring the questionable water through a coffee fi lter or bandana prior to treating it. Doing this removes much of the sediment, debris, and bugs that may be fl oating in 126 116-145_U9037_08.indd 126 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"the puddle or pond. SurvivalResources.com sells a rather inge- nious water purifi cation kit that is designed to utilize common cone-shaped coffee fi lters. At around thirteen dollars, it is worth the investment. Naturally, when it comes to fi nding water on the road in an urban area, you want to avoid sources that are near large manufacturing facilities. Even many of the high-end purifi cation systems won’t work very well on heavy metals and other forms of chemical pollution. While I typically refrain from suggesting activities that are il- legal or even those in a murky gray area of the law, you might con- sider adding a sillcock key to your bug-out bag. Many commercial buildings have a water spigot on an outer wall, but it is missing the handle. Instead, it has what looks like a square nut that must be turned in order to open the faucet. The sillcock key is the tool you use for this purpose. These are available at most home improve- ment stores, typically for well under ten dollars. Obtaining water in this fashion may be illegal, but if you’re just fi lling a couple of bottles and moving on, I doubt you are taking a huge risk. Food Bug-out food should be high-calorie and high-energy. This is not the time to worry about your diet or your waistline. You need fuel for your body for the next leg of your journey. You also want food you can eat quickly. Food in a bug-out bag should require little to no prepara- tion. Think, open, and eat. It also needs a long shelf life, given that it might sit in your bag for months before being eaten. And fi nally, it should be lightweight and take up little pack space. Canned foods, while they last a long time, are just too heavy to be practical for bugging out. With all that in mind, what are some good candidates for the bug-out bag? Start with things like dried nuts and fruit, gra- nola bars, and crackers. Canned tuna is an exception to the rule 127 116-145_U9037_08.indd 127 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"against canned goods as they are small and lightweight. The USDA has said that canned tuna will remain good for at least two years if stored properly. You could also opt for tuna that is packaged in mylar pouches rather than cans. If you go for the canned route, be sure to pack a couple can openers in your bug-out bag. Save space and weight by packing a P-38 or P-51 military-issue can opener. They’re about the size of a razor blade and widely available (simply Google them to fi nd retailers). Per- sonally, I prefer my tuna in water rather than oil, but I recognize that the oil will provide additional calories. Although you’ll be on the move and will need energy, you’ll likely need less food on your bug-out journey than you consume on a normal day. Let’s face it, most of us eat far more calories than we really should to begin with. Add to that the general lack of activity in our daily lives and, well, most of us could probably stand to lose a couple pounds. The point is, while your bug-out bag should have enough food to last at least a few days, that amount is probably less than you imagine it to be. A couple gra- nola bars in the morning, snack on trail mix throughout the day, then a meal of crackers, tuna, and dried fruit in the evening will likely be plenty. You might also consider tossing in a few pieces of hard candy for quick energy boosts. Should you decide you just have to bring along foods that require cooking, if nothing else than just to provide a warm meal at the end of a long day, be sure to include the means to prepare the food. A small mess kit, like the ones used by Boy Scouts, works very well. Something to remember, though, is you’ll also need a way to clean the pans after eating. A square of aluminum foil scrunched up a bit works pretty well as a pot scrubber. Personally, I like to store a Sierra Cup as well as a few bouil- lon cubes in my bug-out bags. While I don’t plan on doing a lot of cooking while on the road, a hot cup of chicken bouillon can be nice on a cool night. Along those same lines, you might want a few packets of instant coffee or some tea bags in your bag. 128 116-145_U9037_08.indd 128 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Other quick-cook options would include the ever-popular ramen noodles. They are light, easy-to-pack, last just about for- ever if kept dry, and can be fi lling. Really, though, any of the convenience foods that just require a little water will work, even the ones that are designed for microwave use. Just heat the wa- ter, add to the food, cover, and wait for the water to soak in. Juice Pouch Food Storage If you have children who love juice pouches such as Capri Sun, don’t toss the empties into the trash. You can reuse them for storing food in your bug-out bag! Those pouches are made of mylar, which is used the world over to package food. For this project, you start by cutting open the pouch. Cut straight across the top of the pouch, just below the hole for the straw. Wash and rinse the pouches very well and let them air dry completely. This is important—the interior of the pouch must be absolutely dry to avoid mold or food spoilage. When the pouch is dry, pour in your food. If you are going to use something like white rice, which is a great idea by the way, use a measuring cup to determine just how much you’ve put in the pouch. Measuring it fi rst will allow you to know how much water to add when you want to cook it. Avoid using wild rice varieties though as they contain oils that will go rancid in the long-term. Stick with white rice, even instant rice will work well. Add a bouillon cube for added fl avor, if you’d like. Dry pasta works well, too. Make sure you leave about an inch or so of empty space in the pouch. Then, pinch the top closed and gently squeeze as much air out as you can. Fold the top over two or three times. Then, seal it closed by running a hot iron over the seam a few times. This melts the mylar slightly, sealing it airtight. There is no need to cover the pouch with a towel before ironing it closed. It takes just a few seconds for the mylar to fuse. I’ve never had an issue with mylar sticking to my iron. Use a marker to write on the outside of the pouch what is inside as well as any preparation instructions. To continue with our rice example, you’d want to note how much water to use when cooking. Note: These pouches are not suitable for cooking in. They are merely a convenient way to store the food in a small package. You will still need to carry a pot or pan to prepare the food. 129 116-145_U9037_08.indd 129 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"You can cook just about anything over a campfi re, provided you have the proper tools and knowledge. However, there may be times when a roaring fi re won’t be a good idea, such as trav- eling through the city at night. Camp stoves are just too heavy and bulky to carry around in your bug-out gear, not to mention needing to also carry the small fuel canisters for one. One op- tion is to invest in an alcohol stove, such as those made by Esbit. These come in very small sizes and are extremely easy to use. Simply fi ll the stove with a little denatured alcohol and light it up. Virtually smokeless, the fl ame is even diffi cult to see because it burns so cleanly. You’ll need to pack a container of alcohol, of course. Many people use small plastic squeeze bottles for this purpose. Store them inside a plastic bag for added protection. Another great bug-out bag cooking option is a buddy burn- er. See chapter fi ve for instructions for making your own buddy burner. They’re lightweight, affordable, and easy to make. Clothing and Shelter Shelter includes all ways to keep you out of the elements, or at least keep the elements off of you. So, we’re not talking about lugging a huge family-size tent but rather making sure you have things like rain ponchos and cold weather clothing. As we talked about earlier, one of the fi rst requirements in this category is proper clothing. If you live in an area where the winters are cold and harsh, your bug-out bag should have an extra pair of mittens or gloves as well as a decent stocking hat. For warm summers, a pair of cargo shorts might be advisable. Clothing needs to be rotated and we’ll discuss how often to inspect your bug-out gear and adjust the contents for the seasons in a bit. Make sure you have clothing that refl ects the climate in your area. No matter the weather or the season, you should have a couple extra pair of socks and underwear. If you’ve ever stepped into a mud puddle and then spent the next few hours walking 130 116-145_U9037_08.indd 130 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"with a wet foot, you know the value of having extra dry socks. Same goes for a wet bottom from sitting on the ground. A couple bandanas are also excellent to have in your kit. I prefer the larger shemagh scarf. These are worn by troops in the Middle East. At roughly two to three feet on each side, they are much larger than the handkerchief-sized bandanas your grand- pa or great-grandpa carried around. A shemagh is great for use as a scarf for warmth, sunblock for your neck, mouth cover- ing to keep out dust and dirt, sling, tourniquet, fi lter to remove debris from water, and a small pillow when wrapped around a couple shirts. You can also place some gear in the middle of the shemegh, fold it over and then tie it over your shoulder and back to create a sling-style pack. Sunglasses are another great idea. Whether driving or walk- ing, they’ll help keep you from squinting at everything. Speaking of squinting, the next time you get new prescription glasses, put the old ones in a hard case and stow them in your bug-out kit. If your current ones get broken or lost, you’ll have a backup pair to use. A pair of spare glasses is also important for those who wear contact lenses. While a backup pair of contacts, along with a small bottle of saline and a spare case, could be added to the bug-out bag, glasses may be a better option. If you end up on the road for a while, there may be hygiene limitations that would cause you to not want to stick your fi nger into your eyes. In addition to the clothing, every bug-out bag should have at least one good emergency blanket. This is something you don’t want to skimp on and get at the dollar store. The ones you fi nd at places like that are thin, tear easily, and are essentially worthless. Spend a few extra bucks and get a good one like the Heatsheets brand. They are durable and work very well. These blankets fold up very small and weigh next to nothing, so it isn’t a bad idea to toss a couple of them in each bug-out bag. When you are in a situation where you need to use an emer- gency blanket, it is important you use it correctly. They are not 131 116-145_U9037_08.indd 131 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"meant to just drape over your shoulders like you might drape a wool blanket. An emergency blanket should be wrapped around you tightly like a cocoon. They work by refl ecting your body heat back toward you. The shorter the distance that heat has to travel, the better. In addition to keeping you warm, you can use an emergency blanket as something to sit on if the ground is wet or tied above you as a makeshift lean-to shelter. A rain poncho is another essential clothing and shelter item. Again, don’t just grab a cheap one but invest in something of decent quality. I’m all about saving money, but when a cheap poncho could mean hypothermia, it’s worth spending a couple extra bucks. Military-style ponchos are heavy duty and have grommets in the corners so you can easily tie the poncho to poles or trees to make a lean-to shelter. There are some experts out there who advocate packing a small tube tent in the bug-out bag. Honestly, I go either way on that. Sure, they work well in keeping the rain off if you have to bed down for the night. Further, they don’t add much weight to the pack. But, really, you can accomplish the same thing by draping one of your emergency blankets over a length of rope and weighing down the sides with rocks or bricks. Fire-Starting Supplies Being able to reliably start a fi re is a valuable component of your bug-out kit. Fire will help keep you warm, cook your food, boil your water, and generally help morale. Little else is more com- forting in the fi eld at night than a good fi re. Your fi re-starting kit should contain several items to help you get a fi re lit. There are two essential elements here: tinder and an ignition source. Tinder is some sort of light material that catches a spark easily. There are many commercially produced items that work well, such as tinder tabs. However, the best tinder I’ve ever used is made simply by taking cotton balls and mixing into them pe- 132 116-145_U9037_08.indd 132 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"troleum jelly. Just take a small sandwich bag, toss in about a dozen cotton balls, then a dollop of jelly. Squish the cotton balls into the jelly and mash it all around for a bit. That’s it—they’re ready to use. If you happen to have an old 35mm fi lm canister, the black ones with the gray lids, those work very well for car- rying these cotton balls. To use them, just take one or two out, pull the fi bers apart a bit, and light. Be sure your hands are completely clean of the petroleum before you light the cotton. The ignition source is what you will use to light the tinder. Now, you certainly could practice primitive methods like bow drills or fi re ploughs, but every survival expert I know carries a butane lighter or two in their kits. Strike-anywhere matches are another great option. A third recommendation, provided you already have the fi rst two, is a magnesium striker. This consists of a block of magnesium with a striker rod embedded along one side. Use a knife blade or some other thin, fl at metal bar to scrape magnesium off the block into a pile about the size of a quarter. Then, fi rmly scrape the back of the blade down the side of the rod, shooting sparks at the magnesium or your tinder. Many of these magnesium fi re starters come with a fl at piece of metal to use as a striker, so as to preserve the edge on your knife. I use a thick rubber band to keep the striker attached to the magnesium block. While urban areas aren’t forests, it shouldn’t be all that dif- fi cult to fi nd fuel for your fi re. Cardboard burns hot and not quite as fast as paper. Broken pallets are often easy to fi nd, as are boards from abandoned buildings. Just always be certain you have plenty of ventilation and avoid sitting too near the fi re where you end up breathing more smoke than air. First Aid and Hygiene For your fi rst aid kit, consider the most likely things you’ll need to address during an urban bug out. The more common inju- ries are going to be cuts and scrapes, possibly a bruise here and there. Hopefully, you’re not going to be dealing with gunshot 133 116-145_U9037_08.indd 133 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"wounds or major head trauma. As for illnesses, really the main concern there is going to be stomach upset from eating bad food or drinking tainted water. Of course, there’s always the chance that someone in your family will already be suffering a head cold or the fl u at the time of the bug out. The point is to build your fi rst aid kit around your expected needs, rather than just going out and buying a pre-made kit and calling it a day. A basic fi rst aid kit for bugging out should include: • adhesive bandages in assorted sizes • antibiotic ointment • burn cream • gauze pads • surgical tape • elastic bandages for sprains • moleskin for blisters • pain relievers and fever reducers (acetaminophen, ibu- profen, aspirin) • anti-diarrhea medications • antacids Include any prescription medications you take on a regular basis as well as anything necessary to treat chronic conditions. As for hygiene, it is diffi cult to keep clean when traveling on the road, but you should include items that will help you make a good effort. Keeping reasonably clean will go far toward re- ducing the risk of illness and infection, as well as help you feel human again. Put together a small kit containing a bar of soap, a washcloth, a toothbrush, toothpaste, and dental fl oss. Use travel- size containers to reduce the overall size and weight of the hy- giene kit. You can fi t all of that into a quart-sized plastic baggie. Women should include feminine hygiene products, which can also be used as tinder. Everyone should have a travel-size package of baby wipes as well as a roll of toilet paper. To save space, remove the cardboard tube, then put the roll into a plastic bag and crush it fl at. 134 116-145_U9037_08.indd 134 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Hand sanitizer is also essential. Use it after every toilet break. Incidentally, it can also serve as a fi re starter, due to the high alcohol content. Just squeeze a little out and light it. Light It is almost a certainty that you’ll do at least some traveling at night. That being the case, you want at least a couple ways of lighting your path. Street lights in the city work great, but if the power is out, the night gets awfully dark. Crank-powered fl ashlights have come a long way and the more modern ones work pretty well. Turn the crank for a minute or so and you’ll get plenty of light that lasts. Headlamps are another piece of technology that has dra- matically improved in recent years. They are small, weigh very little, and those LED bulbs put out a lot of light. The fi rst time you need to make a potty break in the middle of the night, you’ll appreciate the hands-free nature of a headlamp. While snaplights, sometimes called glow sticks, are an op- tion, I don’t like to suggest reliance upon them. They are not reusable, and once they are activated, they cannot be turned off. If you are packing any lights that require batteries, be sure to include at least one extra set for each light in your bug-out bag. My personal recommendations for fl ashlights for the bug- out bag include the Quark Tactical QT2A by Foursevens and the Stylus Pro by Streamlight. Security You should absolutely have some means of defending yourself and your family. For many, this will mean a fi rearm. If you are not legally allowed by to carry a fi rearm, have someone else in your party carry the weapon. The last thing you want is for an overzealous law enforcement offi cer to determine your fi rearm is breaking the law and not only confi scate it but also place you under arrest. Remember, many offi cers will err on the side of 135 116-145_U9037_08.indd 135 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"caution and decide it is just easier to take you into custody than deal with the problem in another way. Firearms require ammu- nition as well as routine cleaning. Be sure to pack accordingly. Should you decide to not carry a gun, you do have some oth- er options. Pepper spray works well and obviously is not lethal. Be sure to get the kind that shoots a stream, rather than a fog. You don’t want a stray breeze to send that chemical back at you. Stun guns are also very effective but require you to be within arm’s reach of your assailant as you need to make physical con- tact with the probes on the device. If you’re close enough to do that, you’re close enough for them to grab you and infl ict damage. An expandable baton is an option, but like the stun gun, it re- quires you to get much closer to an attacker than you’d like to be. I don’t recommend relying on a knife for defense, and here’s why. If a confrontation gets to the point that you are pulling a knife, you are going to get cut. There is no way around it—you will get cut. That’s not a fun prospect no matter which way you look at it. If that’s your only option, so be it. A knife is certainly better than pointing your fi nger at the guy and yelling, “Bang!” Navigation In spite of all the route planning you did ahead of time, fi gure on getting lost at least once or twice along your journey. Getting back on track starts with a good map of the area. As mentioned earlier, keep a street map in your bag. Get to know your chosen routes by traveling them on a regular basis. Pay attention to how things look different from day to night and as the seasons change. A small compass will also help keep you on track, especially once you get past the city limits, but knowing which way is north is only helpful if you know which direction you want to travel. Survival Knives A good quality knife is an essential piece of gear. Not for self- defense necessarily, but you’ll always have a need for a cutting 136 116-145_U9037_08.indd 136 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"implement. For a bug-out bag, I prefer a fi xed-blade knife rather than a folding-knife. A fi xed-blade knife has no moving parts that may fail and is infi nitely stronger than those of the fold- ing variety. It can be diffi cult to navigate through the gazillion choices when it comes to a knife for the bug-out bag. Here are some things you should look for when shopping around for a fi xed blade knife. Blade Steel. The fi rst consideration is the steel used for the blade. Carbon steel makes for a very strong blade. However, carbon steel is also somewhat prone to rust, so give the blade a thin coat of mineral oil after sharpening. Full Tang. The next consideration is the construction of the knife. A full tang is desired. This means the piece of metal form- ing the blade continues completely through the handle. This should be evident by examining the knife handle. Avoid pur- chasing hollow handle knives. While they look cool, all but the very high-quality ones will fall apart rather quickly under use in the real world. Handle and Shape. The handle material and shape are also important. The knife should be comfortable to hold and use. I prefer a bit of roughness to the handle as that helps me to keep a tight grip if the knife gets wet. Blade Length. Despite what you may see on TV or in the movies, you truly don’t need a blade as long as your forearm. Stick with a blade that is around four or fi ve inches in length. That will be plenty of blade to do just about anything an urban prepper might have to handle. Personally, I don’t care for ser- rated or partially serrated blades. While they are useful when cutting wet rope and some other materials, they are also much more diffi cult to sharpen in the fi eld unless you really know what you are doing and have the right gear with you. Speaking of sharpening, add to your kit a pocket knife sharpener, such as the Lansky BladeMedic. A dull knife is more dangerous than a sharp one as you’ll need to apply more pres- 137 116-145_U9037_08.indd 137 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"sure when cutting. A pocket sharpener will allow you to touch up the blade as needed. The knife sheath is also important. I’ve run across many great knives at great prices and passed them by because the sheath was inferior. The sheath should be solidly constructed, either of thick leather or a heavy plastic like Kydex. The knife should be fully re- tained by the sheath, with no wiggle room. The last thing you want is for the knife to come loose and fall out while you’re running. I have owned many knives and recommend any of these manufacturers: • Cold Steel • TOPS Knives • Mission Knives • Condor Tool and Knife • Becker Knife and Tool While I tend to change things up from time to time with regards to my bug-out knife, my current bug-out knife is the Brothers of Bushcraft (B.O.B.) knife made by TOPS Knives. Two recommended knives for urban survival kits, the TOPS Knives Broth- ers of Bushcraft Fieldcraft knife (left) and the Bad Monkey folding knife by Southern Grind (right). 138 116-145_U9037_08.indd 138 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Multi-Tool Multi-tools are very useful but always carry them in addition to a sturdy survival knife. It’s interesting to note that, in an informal polling of friends and family members, each person admitted to using a multi-tool far more than they’d imagined they would when they fi rst bought one. It is just one of those things that, once you have it, you’ll wonder how you ever got along without one. The fi rst true multi-tool came out in the mid-1980s, invent- ed by Tim Leatherman. Since that time, thousands of varieties have been brought to market by many different manufacturers. Choosing a Folding Knife Although I prefer a fi xed-blade knife, folding knives are obviously smaller than most fi xed-blade knives and as a result may be better suited for some urban preppers. While most multi-tools have at least one blade, I prefer to have a separate folding knife. In my opinion, it just makes sense to rely on something that was designed to be a knife, rather than just have the blade be an accessory within something else. The fi rst thing to look for in a folding knife is the same as with a fi xed blade—the steel. Avoid anything that is labeled Pakistan or China. With just a bit of effort, you’d be able to bend those blades with your bare hands. Instead, look for 440C steel or a carbon steel. I prefer a blade that locks into place when opened. Personally, I fi nd this safer than if the blade can simply fold back up with a bit of pressure. Many folding knives today also have a notch or pin attached to the blade that allows you to open the knife with one hand. This is a great feature and is very useful. Many folding knives are also sold with small clips along the side, so you can secure it to your pocket. This is also desired. When opened, the blade should not wiggle in any way at all. If it does, pass and purchase something else. Whether the folding knife has a locking blade or not, it should snap into place fi rmly when opened. I greatly favor my Bad Monkey folding knife, manufactured by Southern Grind. The blade is a bit long at four inches but it fi ts into my pocket nicely. It is a strong, dependable folding knife. Another great option is to pick up any of the genuine Swiss Army folding knives, such as the Victorinox Swiss Army Tinker knife I’ve carried for about three decades. 139 116-145_U9037_08.indd 139 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"While the combinations of tools included in various multi- tools can be dizzying, there are only a few I feel are absolutely es- sential. First, it should have at least one sharp blade. This serves as a backup to your folding or fi xed-blade knife in your bug-out bag. Second, the multi-tool should have pliers. Most multi-tools have pliers that also incorporate a wire cutter as well. The pliers are used for holding things, twisting wire, loosening or tighten- ing bolts or nuts, and removing nails. Screwdriver heads are also very useful, both fl at and Phillips. You’ll use them for loosening or tightening screws, of course. Some multi-tools are confi gured with several different sizes of screwdriver heads, which is great. Finally, a can opener is very handy and recommended. While you should have a separate can opener, such as a P-38 military- style one, in your bug-out bag, having a secondary one as part of your multi-tool gives you a backup. As with any other tool, I suggest going with a known brand name, rather than a cheap knockoff variety. Recommended brands include Leatherman and Gerber. I’ve carried one of the older Leatherman models for many years without issue or complaint. Other Practical Tools Paracord Paracord is very useful. Incredibly strong, yet about the same thickness as a shoelace, it consists of seven inner strands of cordage surrounded by an outer covering. You can easily re- move one or more of the inner strands by pulling it free. What this means is, if you have twenty feet of paracord, you actually have 160 feet of cordage (seven inner strands plus the sheath). Each of those inner strands can also be unraveled into two sepa- rate cords, but really they get so thin at that point they aren’t all that useful. Duct Tape A small roll of duct tape can be used to patch holes in your emergency blankets, even your clothing. Rather than lugging around the big, heavy cardboard roll, wrap several feet 140 116-145_U9037_08.indd 140 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"around a pencil stub. Or, wrap lengths around your lighters and your water bottles to distribute the load and keep bulk down. Pencil and Notepad Speaking of pencils, a few of those with a small notebook are great to have. You may be surprised at how often you might want to jot something down, such as a note of a specifi c intersection in case you take a wrong turn down the road a bit. Pry Bar A small pry bar may prove to be extremely useful during an urban bug out. While I try to refrain from suggest- ing illegal acts, in a true crisis you may fi nd it necessary to pry open a door in order to effect your escape from danger. Tita- nium pry bars offer a high degree of strength while not adding much weight to your pack. A key-chain-size pry bar, such as the Boker titanium Vox Access Tool, may do the trick in some cases. Garbage Bags Contractor-grade garbage bags have many uses, so pack several in your bug-out bag. They can be used as improvised rain ponchos, to carry scavenged supplies, or even placed on the ground before sitting so you don’t end up with a wet butt. Hand T rowel A hand trowel is used for burying garbage and waste, should the need arise. Small and lightweight, it won’t add much bulk to your bug-out bag. Wrapping several feet of paracord around an old credit card allows for flat storage in a survival kit. This also prevents it from getting tangled. 141 116-145_U9037_08.indd 141 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Comfort Items There are several items you’ll want in the bug-out bag that, while not essential to survival, sure can make things easier on you. Remember, if you are in a situation where you are relying on your bug-out bag to keep you alive, anything you can to do help reduce stress is important. A wide-brimmed hat will keep the sun off your face. It can also serve to break up your outline when you are trying to stay hidden or for some reason you need to change your appearance. Insect repellent might not be quite as important in most ur- ban settings as it is out in the country, but you may fi nd it benefi - cial. Sunscreen will keep you from getting burned as you travel. Remember, you may end up conducting part or all of your jour- ney on foot rather than in a vehicle. Lip balm sounds like such a luxury item for a survival kit, but if you’ve ever experienced severe chapped lips, you’ll recog- nize the importance of this item. For many people, having some sort of inspirational item may be essential. This could be a religious text or perhaps pho- tos of loved ones. The idea is to have something with you that will bring you a measure of emotional comfort. Boredom relievers are also recommended. A small book or a deck of cards cannot only help pass the time but keep you from dwelling on negative thoughts. It is important to remain as posi- tive as you can in a survival situation. Types of Packs Now, how are you going to lug all that stuff around? In general, the wise decision is to invest in a pack that you can carry on your back, so as to keep your hands free. The second best option is a duffel bag you can strap across your body. The pack is an important area where you may want to invest a few extra dol- lars to get something of decent quality. The backpacks you fi nd on sale during back-to-school season are generally poorly made 142 116-145_U9037_08.indd 142 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"and will fall apart sooner rather than later. A better choice is to visit sporting good stores and outdoor retailers and choose a pack designed for hiking and backpacking. One benefi t of visit- ing these stores is the employees are able to help you choose the perfect pack for your body shape. A second option is to search out genuine military surplus packs, avoiding cheap knockoffs. I prefer packs that have several pockets inside and out. This helps with keeping things organized and easy to fi nd. It is a pain in the posterior to need a fl ashlight and have to dig through the entire pack in the dark trying to fi nd it. Wheeled suitcases are also a bad idea. Sure, they work great in airport terminals, where the fl oor is nice and smooth, but go- ing over broken pavement or gravel...not so much. If you have to carry such a monstrosity over rough terrain, they are heavy. Plus, they require the use of at least one hand to pull or carry it. Remember, you want both hands free as much as possible. It makes it easier to walk, plus in case something happens you can react quicker. Whichever kind of pack you decide to get, be sure to test it out thoroughly. Load your gear and wear the pack for at least Bug-Out Bags for Children Children cannot be expected to carry full-size bug-out bags, of course. However, even young children can carry at least a small amount of supplies. Most children over the age of four or so can carry a small backpack with a change of clothes, some snacks, and a water bottle. As they get older and stronger, gradually add to their packs more gear and supplies. Do everything you can to keep the items in the child’s bug-out bag age-appropriate. For example, don’t give a six-year-old a sheath knife or pistol. Even if they’ve been instructed to never use or even touch the item, temptation may win out. One particular item that every single child should have with them is a loud whistle. Teach them to use the whistle if they get lost or feel they are in danger. A piercing whistle will cut through the noise of crowds and allow you to pinpoint the child’s location quickly. 143 116-145_U9037_08.indd 143 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"a few hours at a time. Get used to how it feels, how the weight shifts as you move. This testing also allows you to determine how much weight you’ll need to cut from your bug-out bag so carrying it a long distance is more realistic. Every member of the family will need his or her own bug-out bag and each bag should be tailored for individual needs as well as physical capabilities. Choose packs based upon what will be carried in them, rather than buying a giant pack and feeling compelled to fi ll it up. In fact, the best approach is to fi rst assemble all the supplies and gear to be carried, then purchase a pack based on the size needed. All too often, people will buy a large pack and feel as though they need to fi ll it to the top, frequently adding entirely too much stuff just because they have extra space in the pack. WHERE SHOULD THE BUG-OUT BAGS BE STORED? A bug-out bag does no good if it cannot be readily accessed in an emergency. Therefore, you want it someplace close to you as much as possible. If you own a car or truck, this is where you want to keep your bug-out bag. Tossing the bug-out bag in the trunk or behind a truck’s seat will keep prying eyes from seeing it. Having the bug-out bag already in your vehicle means you don’t need to remember to grab it on your way out the door during an evacuation. The other option is to store the bug-out bag in the home, such as at the back of a closet near the front door. It is important that all family members know where the bug-out bag(s) are lo- cated. Remember, you may not be home yourself and other fam- ily members will need to grab the bags as they leave the home. HOW OFTEN SHOULD THE BUG-OUT BAG BE INSPECTED? Every six months or so, completely unpack your bags and in- spect each item thoroughly. Rotate out the food items well be- fore they expire and replace with new food. Do the same with 144 116-145_U9037_08.indd 144 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"any water you’ve packed, consuming the old water or pouring it on your garden or houseplants. Check all batteries to make sure they are still good and replace any that don’t pass muster. Check each piece of equipment to make sure it is in working order. Touch up any blades to ensure they are sharp. If you have lost or gained an appreciable amount of weight since the last time you unpacked your kits, you will want to change out any clothing so what you have packed will fi t you. I suggest you use the dates for daylight-saving time changes as reminders to inspect your bug-out bags and get-home bags. This ensures you are checking through all of your gear at least twice a year. SUMMARY While sheltering in place is usually the ideal plan for most poten- tial disasters, it is important to plan for a time when home may no longer be a safe location. However, just hitting the road with- out a planned destination will only make you one more refugee. Take the time to pack a bug-out bag, as well as a get-home bag if need be, and choose several possible destinations so as to give you options. 145 116-145_U9037_08.indd 145 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"APPENDIX A FOOD STORAGE AND MEAL PLANNING The following lists should be considered a guideline for your food storage planning.

Few people will want to eat the exact same thing at each meal, day in and day out, so variety is important. 146 146-148_U9037_APP_a.indd 146 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"CANNED GOODS DRY GOODS BAKING SUPPLIES TREATS/SNACKS Condensed soup Pasta Flour Hard candy Tuna Rice Sugar Chocolate bars Chicken Beans Yeast Popcorn (bagged) Beef Split peas Baking powder Chips Corn Dehydrated soups Baking mixes Granola bars Green beans Powdered milk Coffee Peas Instant mashed potatoes Te a Stew Gravy mixes Juice mix Chili Crackers Pasta sauce Corn meal Peaches Salt Fruit cocktail Bouillon (cubes or granules) Pears Instant oatmeal Just-add-water pancake mix Just-add-water biscuit mix Day 1 Breakfast: Pancakes with honey or syrup, canned peaches, multi- vitamin tea or instant coffee Lunch: Chicken noodle soup (condensed), crackers with canned tuna Snack: Popcorn Dinner: Canned beef with gravy over rice, canned corn, water, tea, or juice mix, chocolate bar Day 2 Breakfast: Instant oatmeal, canned pears, multi-vitamin, tea or instant coffee Lunch: Canned chili, crackers Snack: Chips Dinner: Canned chicken mixed with pasta, canned peas, choco- late chip granola bars 147 146-148_U9037_APP_a.indd 147 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Day 3 Breakfast: Biscuits with gravy, fruit cocktail, multi-vitamin, tea or instant coffee Lunch: Stew, crackers Snack: Granola bar Dinner: Beans and rice, canned green beans, biscuits with honey As you can see, there are a number of meals, with plenty of va- riety, that can be made from very simple foods that store well.

It stands for Everyday Carry. EDC refers to the items you want to have on your person every time you leave the house. By having at least some gear with you at all times, you’ll be less likely to be caught off-guard by a sudden emergency. Depending on where you work, you may not be allowed to have all these items with you every single day. For example, if you are an attorney, you probably visit courthouses on a regular basis. If you attempt to bring in even a very small folding knife with a blade about an inch long, you may never see it again. CELL PHONE A cell phone may turn out to be the most important emergency item you can carry. Make sure you have a car charger for your phone and get into the habit of plugging it in any time you get into the vehicle. This lessens the chance of a dead cell battery when you need the phone the most. You may also want to print up a small wallet card with important phone numbers on it. If your cell dies, you won’t be able to access the contacts list. 149 149-153_U9037_APP_b.indd 149 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"MULTI-TOOL A multi-tool isn’t ever going to replace your toolbox but it is much easier to carry around. Spend the extra money to get some- thing of good quality so it will hold up to regular use. If you’ve never carried one before, you may be surprised at how often you end up pulling it out of your pocket. While there are keychain- size models, I prefer the full-size ones. They aren’t much larger than their smaller cousins and are much easier to use. Look for brands like Leatherman and Gerber and avoid the cheap look- alikes. The tools I use most often include a knife blade, pliers, wire cutters, and screwdriver heads (fl at and Phillips). POCKET KNIFE A knife is one of the most important parts of any survival kit. As with the multi-tool, don’t cheap out on this. Get something that is going to last. My favorite pocket knives are produced by companies such as Southern Grind and Victorinox. Buck is an- other very well-known brand and I’ve carried their Buck Folding Hunter knife on my belt off and on since I was a young boy. CASH AND CREDIT CARD Cash and a credit card are a necessary component of the urban EDC kit. Ideally, the credit card should be one with a zero bal- ance and the only time you’ll use it is in emergencies. This is not the card you’ll use at Starbucks every morning. You want as much of an available balance as you can manage. While some disasters will end up negating the use of credit cards (e.g., ma- jor power outages cutting off computers), always try to use the card fi rst if you fi nd yourself needing to make a purchase or secure a motel room for the night. This frees up your available cash. Carry at least enough money to cover a motel room and a meal or two. This amount will vary, of course, based upon where you live. In the upper Midwest, maybe two hundred dol- lars would be enough. In New York City, that number might 150 149-153_U9037_APP_b.indd 150 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"have to double. Stick with small bills, nothing higher than a twenty. You may fi nd it diffi cult for people to break larger bills. FLASHLIGHT One of the best fl ashlights I’ve come across is the Maxxeon Pock- et Flashlight. Exceptionally powerful and in a relatively small package, it takes three AAA batteries. At 140 lumens, it is bright enough to even help as a self-defense weapon, blinding an at- tacker so you can escape. Another light I highly recommend is the Quark Tactical QT2A produced by Foursevens. It takes two AA batteries and at its maximum setting produces 246 lumens. It is solidly constructed and made to take a beating. NOTEBOOK A small notebook is great for jotting down notes, such as where you parked or the license plate number of the car that ran you off the road. Keep a pencil with it. Pens run out of ink or can freeze up whereas pencils can be sharpened with your pocket- knife if need be. In the inside cover of the notebook, write down any important phone numbers. Today, many people rely on their cell phone speed dial, but if you lose the phone or the battery dies, will you know the numbers to call in an emergency? FIRE TINDER AND IGNITION SOURCE No kit is complete without the means to light a fi re. Therefore, keep a lighter as well as a small stash of tinder with you. The tinder could be as simple as some dryer lint held in one of those keychain fobs normally used for medications. PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION Make sure you always carry enough prescription medications to last you one or two days. Use one of the aforementioned keychain fobs to keep it in. 151 149-153_U9037_APP_b.indd 151 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"EMERGENCY WHISTLE A whistle can be of great help if you need to signal for assistance. The sound from a whistle will carry much farther than a human voice. You’ll want this with you in case you end up trapped in a building due to fi re or some other emergency. SELF-DEFENSE WEAPON This one is a judgment call and each person needs to decide for him or herself if they want to carry something for self-defense and, if so, what it should be. For many, at least here in the Unit- ed States, the weapon of choice is a handgun. Should you go that route, I implore you to seek out the proper training. You should also carry enough ammunition to fully reload your weapon at least twice. A gun without bullets is nothing more than an oddly shaped club. Other self-defense options include pepper spray, stun guns, Tasers, and expandable batons. Each has advantages and draw- backs, as well as issues of legality based upon where you live and work. I know it all sounds like a lot of stuff but, really, most of it will fi t into your pockets without much bulk. You can also make a keychain EDC kit, where several of the items, such as the knife, whistle, and fobs, are looped onto a keychain, which then goes into your pocket. This keeps all those items together easily. An- other option might be to purchase a belt pouch to keep it all in. EDC FOR CHILDREN Even at a rather young age, children are able to carry at least a few things to use in case of an emergency. You’re not going to give a four-year-old a nifty pocketknife, but, they can certainly carry a whistle in their pocket. That’s a great place to start, in fact. Teach them to use the whistle if they ever get lost. As they get older, add to their EDC gear as appropriate. While school rules will probably forbid the carrying of knives or 152 149-153_U9037_APP_b.indd 152 7/29/14 12:45 PM"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"multi-tools, they can certainly have fl ashlights and cell phones. When you feel they are mature enough, let them carry small folding knives or multi-tools when they aren’t in school, taking care to teach them the proper use and maintenance of them. In return, maybe they can teach you how to use your cell phone to surf the Web or perhaps even make a phone call. Speaking of telephones, consider printing out a small list of important phone numbers, such as home, work, and cell numbers for the parents, and the numbers for at least one or two other trusted adults. Laminate this list and keep it in your child’s backpack. 153 149-153_U9037_APP_b.indd 153 7/29/14 12:46 PM"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"APPENDIX C WORKPLACE EMERGENCY KIT In the event the weather or some other development forces you to hunker down at your workplace for a day or so, it is wise to assemble a workplace emergency kit you can keep at your desk or in your locker. This kit won’t make you totally self-sustaining but will help you “over the hump” until you can get to your bug-out bag or other supplies. EMERGENCY BLANKET Your shelter needs will likely be already met by staying inside the offi ce or factory building. While certainly not as comfy as home, at least you’ll be out of the elements. An emergency blanket, such as those sold under the Heatsheets brand, will probably suffi ce if the power is out and no heat is coming through the ducts. FOOD AND WATER You should have enough food and water to last you two full days. Granted, that’s probably overkill, but better to have too much than not enough. Concentrate on stocking this kit with food items that last a long time at room temperature and require no preparation prior to consumption. Examples include crack- ers with peanut butter, dried fruit, nuts, granola or protein bars, 154 154-157_U9037_APP_c.indd 154 7/29/14 12:46 PM"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"and tuna in pouches. For your hydration needs, toss in a few large bottles of water. LOOSE CHANGE While you should have at least a few dollars in change to use in the vending machines, you shouldn’t count on those machines remaining fully stocked for very long or working if the power goes out. FIRST AID KIT Most workplaces have at least some sort of fi rst aid supplies somewhere on site. But, feel free to toss into your bag a small fi rst aid kit. Some adhesive bandages, antibiotic ointment, burn cream, and the like will do. Nothing fancy, just stuff to handle a few scrapes or cuts. Whether you include a fi rst aid kit or not, be sure to have enough prescription medications to last a few days, just in case you are somehow cut off from your regular supply. FLASHLIGHT A good quality fl ashlight or headlamp will make you the envy of your coworkers. Be sure to have at least one extra set of bat- teries. Having a portable light source will make moving around easier, even if it is only getting to the bathroom and back. RADIO Having a crank-powered radio will help you and your fellow employees stay informed about the situation at hand. You could go with a battery-powered, of course. If you go that route, make sure you have an extra set of fresh batteries for it. HYGIENE KIT A small hygiene kit will certainly be welcome. Just take a quart- size plastic bag and toss in a toothbrush, a small tube of tooth- paste, a bar of soap, a washcloth, and a travel-size deodorant. 155 154-157_U9037_APP_c.indd 155 7/29/14 12:46 PM"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"CHANGE OF CLOTHES You may want a change of clothes as well.

BOREDOM RELIEVERS Items like a paperback book, crossword puzzles, and the like will help keep you sane as well as help time to go by faster. Keep all of these supplies in a small duffel bag and put it into your locker or to the side of your desk. Don’t go digging around in it a week later, looking for a snack. This stuff should be treated as for emergencies only. 156 154-157_U9037_APP_c.indd 156 7/29/14 12:46 PM"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"WORKPLACE EMERGENCY KIT CHECKLIST ■ emergency blanket ■ food for two days ■ water for two days ■ $5 in change ■ prescription medication ■ small fi rst aid kit ■ fl ashlight or headlamp with extra batteries ■ crank-powered radio ■ toothbrush ■ travel-size toothpaste ■ bar of soap ■ washcloth ■ travel-size deodorant ■ change of socks and underwear ■ full change of clothes (optional) ■ entertainment item (book, cards, etc.) 157 154-157_U9037_APP_c.indd 157 7/29/14 12:46 PM"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"APPENDIX D GET-HOME BAG CHECKLIST The get-home bag differs slightly from the bug-out bag, both in content and in intent. Where the bug-out bag is designed to get you from home to a safe location, the purpose of the get-home bag is simply to provide for your needs during your commute home in an emergency. This being the case, the get-home bag is smaller and lighter than the bug-out bag. As a result, it is easier to store at work, such as in a locker or in the corner of a cubicle. You will also notice some degree of duplication between the get home bag described here (and discussed at length in chapter three) and the workplace emergency kit in appendix C. This is intentional and not an over- sight. The idea is that you can augment your get-home bag with your workplace emergency kit if needed. Building survival kits is all about creating layers. One layer supplements the next, and so on. The get-home bag should contain the following. COMPLETE CHANGE OF CLOTHES The clothing you pack should be durable as well as comfortable for walking. Don’t forget a pair of sturdy and comfortable shoes as well as thick socks. 158 158-161_U9037_APP_d.indd 158 7/29/14 12:46 PM"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"FOOD AND WATER Pack enough to last your expected journey, plus a bit extra. For many urban residents, their commute back home, even if on foot, may take only a few hours. That being the case, there is no need to pack like you’re planning to traverse the Sahara Desert. Just some basic snacks, such as trail mix, dried fruit, and crackers, should suffi ce. For water, pack at least one fi lled liter bottle as well as water purifi cation tablets or a small water disinfection unit. SMALL FIRST AID KIT Fill this kit with adhesive bandages, antibiotic ointment, mole- skin, and pain relievers. FIRE-STARTING GEAR This includes items such as a butane lighter, strike-anywhere matches, and ready-to-use tinder such as dryer lint or WetFire cubes. EMERGENCY BLANKET Pack at least one emergency blanket, which can keep you warm as well as be used as a rain poncho or expedient shelter. TOOLS Pack a good quality knife and multi-tool. You’ll also need a fl ashlight with extra batteries. I like the Quark Tactical QT2A or the Streamlight Stylus Pro. Don’t overlook work gloves. Given that you’ll be moving through areas that may be fi lled with storm damage and other debris, gloves will protect your hands. And be sure to include a bandana, which has innumerable uses.

The following is a checklist of supplies that you should have in your vehicle emergency kit. Feel free to add to it as you see fi t and consider these suggestions as the bare minimum of supplies. You’ll notice that the majority of these items are geared towards getting you back on the road.

It is your lifeline in the event of disaster. The bug-out bag is designed to provide for all of your basic needs until you reach a safe location. Inspect the contents regu- larly and rotate the food and water every six months or so to keep everything fresh. While bugging out in an urban environment seems like it would be very different than doing so out in the sticks, the same principles apply. You need ways to keep warm and out of the elements, stay fed and hydrated, stay clean and healthy, and stay safe from harm. The true differences lie in the means to achieve those goals. For example, you probably won’t be building a de- bris hut in the middle of a large city. Instead, you’ll be wrapping yourself up in an emergency blanket or draping a tarp above you to keep off the rain or snow. SHELTER Don’t plan on packing any sort of tent, no matter how light- weight it may seem. The vast majority of tents, even the name brand models, just aren’t durable enough for bugging out for any length of time. Zippers break, poles snap or get lost. Instead, just 164 164-169_U9037_APP_f.indd 164 7/29/14 12:46 PM"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"get a waterproof nylon tarp and some cordage.

Even the smallest fi re will provide you with light, warmth, and a means of heating food and water.

Stick with food items that require little or no preparation. Canned goods are heavy, so avoid them if possible.

However, if you can legally own and carry a handgun, that is the preferred item to pack for defense purposes. Of course, along with that comes a requirement to not only receive training in the proper use and maintenance of the weapon but also regular practice to become profi cient. If you have chosen to carry a fi rearm as part of your EDC gear (see appendix B), then you’ll have this section of your bug-out bag covered already.

With many other survival-planning resources emphasizing that approach, urban dwellers that plan to stay put in the city, no matter the circumstanc- es, have been overlooked. Not only do 58 percent of Americans live in cities, but certain risks are higher in cities than elsewhere. Urban Emergency Sur vival Plan delivers a common-sense approach to urban survival planning rather than advocating that city survivalists need to fi gure out a way to grow an acre of food, raise goats, and build an underground bunker. The clearly outlined approach here will help you to reduce the risks inherent in disasters that occur in well-populated areas. Inside you’ll fi nd: • packing lists for get-home bags, everyday carry items for adults and kids and bug-out bags • an overview of threats that face an urban area and instructions for planning safe travel during and after disasters, as well as how to plan a temporary escape • instructions for sheltering in place at work • chapters on food storage and water procurement in urban areas with empha- sis on limited space and budget • a detailed chapter on security options in urban areas • a detailed chapter on sanitation, fi rst aid and shelter • ideas for how to respond and cooperate with government disaster plans • photos of important survival gear Discover the skills you’ll need to weather any storm, whether you live in an apartment, townhouse, condominium, single-family home or any other urban setting. With planning and practice, you’ll gain the confi dence to always feel safe in the city.
