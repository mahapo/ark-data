[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Old-Time Vittles Tired of freeze-dried? How about some hardtrack and corn dodgers for a tasty change of pace. By Buck Tilton , BACKPACKER Contributing Editor, September 2000 The one time I went backpacking with my friend Chris, I found out what it's like to go the \"all-natural way,\" as he calls it. He wears wool, sleeps on a sheepskin after wrapping himself in a wool blanket, and cooks in a black iron pot on open fl ames. \"All natural,\" I found out, also applies to his cotton food bag with rawhide drawstring: the contents include cornmeal and fl our, beans and dried meat, maybe a few raisins. Chris likes to experience the backcountry much like the grisly mountain men did in the early 1800s. In those days of yore, there was a lot of truly wild and rugged land to wander through, and wilderness adventures lasted for many months, even years. The original outdoorsmen saw food as fuel, rather than as an epicurean delight. Not that the fi rst \"backpackers\"--the ranks included Native Americans, explorers, soldiers, pioneers, cowboys, as well as trappers--despised a tasty meal. Just the opposite, I reckon. Those who spent most of their days outdoors learned to whip up a culinary delight or two from some seriously basic foodstuffs, like dried beans and meat (satisfi ed the protein needs), plus fl our, various forms of oats and grains, and cornmeal. Dried fruit, sugar, pepper, salt, and fat straight from the carcass of a fresh kill also fi gured into the daily menu, and all in all, these travelers managed to maintain a balanced, albeit predictable, diet that kept them relatively healthy. Since that excursion with Chris, I've been intrigued by the prospect of making dinner from similarly slim pickins and have experimented with recipes gleaned from the pages of history. The resulting foods offer interesting variations on the traditional trail diet, not to mention edibles that'll outlast your favorite pair of boots. Recipes Snack Corn Dodgers Recipe Ingredients • 2 Cups cornmeal • 1/2 Teaspoon salt • 2 Teaspoons baking powder • 2 Tablespoons butter • 2/3 Cup reconstituted milk • 2/3 oil Serves: 8 Cornmeal packed small and light, making it the favored way for pioneers to lug the yellow grain cross-country. Johnnycakes, or hoecakes, were baked yummies of cornmeal mixed with a dollop of bear grease or lard. My personal favorites, corn dodgers, are easy to make on the trail and were eaten by many a U.S. infantry man. At Home: Combine the dry ingredients in a zipper-lock bag. In Camp: Soften the butter and stir into dry mixture. Add milk. Form into \"dodgers,\" fl at, thin patties or tiny bullet-shaped loaves. Fry in a pan of hot oil until both sides are brown. Yield: 20 2-inch dodgers.

At Home: Partially freeze the meat so it's easier to slice into strips no more than 1/2-inch thick. Trim away fat. Mix the Worcestershire and soy sauces with the garlic in a dish. Rub the meat with a little salt and pepper and place it in the marinade. Refrigerate the marinating meat for at least 24 hours. Pat the meat dry and place it in a dehydrator or oven for 7 to 8 hours, until it's dry yet pliable. For oven drying, evenly space the meat on the rack and spread foil beneath it to catch the drips. Set the oven to 150°F, and leave the oven door open slightly for better circulation.
