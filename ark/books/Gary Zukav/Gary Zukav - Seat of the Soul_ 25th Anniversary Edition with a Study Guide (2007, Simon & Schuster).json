I happened to bethe first to finish, which meant I had no one to discuss the book with. So, Igot my hands on the Mount Shasta, California, phone directory and called GaryZukav.“Mr. Zukav, hello, my name is Oprah. I just want to talk to you about your bookand would love for you to come on my show and share your—”“What did you say your name was?”“Oprah.”“Could you spell that, please,” he said.I did. “O-p-r-a-h, and the ‘h’ is silent,” I explained. And then I told him thatI had a talk show, and had to explain what a talk show was, because Gary hadbeen without a TV for several years. This, of course, made me even more eager tospeak with him. I wanted to know how he knew what he knew. The things he’dwritten resonated so deeply with me, and felt so true, but how did he know forsure?Images [../images/00009.jpeg]The Seat of the Soul changed the way I see myself. It changed the way I view theworld. It caused a profound shift in the way I conduct all my relationships,business and personal.The book came to me at the perfect time—at a moment in my life when I was readyfor and open to more. More connection. More harmony. More peace. More joy. Icould sense that there was more to our existence than day-to-day experiences andthe rituals of work and relationships, more to life than our five senses couldhold.The Seat of the Soul put into words what my own soul already knew and had beentrying to tell me. It was such an exhilarating awakening to see affirmed inprint what I hadn’t discovered the language to articulate myself. When I firstread the words “multisensory perception,” I felt as though Gary had touched anerve. In fact, the book felt like one great multisensory explosion. EverywhereI looked after reading it, I saw and experienced life in a new light.Gary’s book was one aha moment after another, all steering me in the directionof true north. My favorite insight: “When the personality comes fully to servethe energy of its soul, that is authentic empowerment.”Images [../images/00009.jpeg]It’s no big secret that I have a big personality. I’ve been using it to myadvantage since the third grade. But using that personality to serve my soul—andmaking sure the two were aligned—changed the way I did everything. I suddenlyrecognized all the times I’d gotten off track by letting my personality rule. Istarted to notice that the degree to which I ever felt unhappiness, discomfort,or despair was in direct proportion to how far I let myself stray from the seatof my soul.The chapter that stirred me most was the one about intention. These words becamemy living creed: “Every action, thought, and feeling is motivated by anintention, and that intention is a cause that exists as one with an effect. Ifwe participate in the cause, it is not possible for us not to participate in theeffect. In this most profound way we are held responsible for our every action,thought, and feeling, which is to say, for our every intention.” Those wordschanged my life.Prior to reading The Seat of the Soul, I suffered from the disease to please.Like millions of people, most of them women, I was a slave to the needs, wants,and desires of others. I would say yes when I seriously wanted to say no.I would give precious time and energy, money, gifts—whatever was asked—simply toavoid the possibility of upsetting someone. I once flew from Chicago to Spain,appeared onstage for less than forty-five seconds at a friend’s charity benefit,then got back on a plane and flew straight to work to do my show—all because Ididn’t know how to say no. To this day, I couldn’t even tell you what thecharity event was for.This sort of thing used to happen to me a lot. My life was a whirlwind of oneevent after another, nonstop speaking engagements, appearances for almost anyonewho asked. I wanted people to like me. And as long as I gave them what theywanted, I suppose they did.My breakthrough was recognizing that my intention to be liked was causing allthe requests. Cause and effect. If your intention is to do what other peoplewant, they will keep asking you to do exactly that. That was an aha moment! WhenI changed my intention to be about doing what I wanted, what I felt was worthyof my time, the effect automatically changed.Twenty-five years later, today, for me, moving with intentional purpose is likebreathing, but I had to learn the practice from the pages of The Seat of theSoul. Gary Zukav’s principle of intention fundamentally altered my every action.It even changed the consciousness of The Oprah Winfrey Show. When we firststarted, producers would present their ideas in a weekly pitch session, butafter encountering Gary’s ideas from The Seat of the Soul, I created a newpolicy. For all the producers, I would say: State your intention for the showfirst. Why do you want to do it? What do you want the outcome to be?Sometimes producers—who had to fill two hundred show slots a year—would make upan intention just to appease me, and I would say, “Nope, not a good enoughreason.” Even if the intention had no redeeming value other than, “We just wantto entertain people and get a high rating,” I encouraged all of us to be clearabout it. State your case with intention and purpose, and the result will followsuit.Images [../images/00009.jpeg]On Gary Zukav’s first appearance on my show, in 1998, we discussed the nature ofthe soul. That interview set my career on a new course. Bringing spirituality todaytime television was uncharted territory. Having a conversation aboutconsciousness, responsibility, intention, and the Law of Cause and Effect wasnot exactly ratings-busting TV, but I told myself, If not now, when? To behonest, had I not owned and controlled the show, Gary’s thirty-six appearancesover the years would never have happened. My producers were convinced in thebeginning that television wasn’t ready for a conversation about the soul.But the course I took has served me well. And I continue to explore thespiritual side of life on my OWN cable network. Quite frankly, I don’t believe Iwould ever have dreamed of creating such a network had I not read The Seat ofthe Soul.I’ve taught leadership classes at the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girlswith the help of The Seat of the Soul. I’ve used its principles to teachelementary school students, high school students, even MBAs at the KelloggSchool of Management. I get a surge of delight every single time someone readsthis book and feels the amazement I felt twenty-five years ago. If you’re readyto see the world in a new way, if you’re ready for your life to open up andchange, if you’re ready for an exhilarating awakening, I think you’ll feel it,too."},{"pageContent":"PREFACE TO THE SEAT OF THE SOUL 25TH ANNIVERSARY EDITIONBYDR. MAYA ANGELOUCourage is the most important of all the virtues because without courage onecannot practice any virtue consistently. We can be kind, generous, just,courteous, and merciful sporadically, but to display those virtues,consistently, calls for an enormous display of courage. From childhood on wehave been taught that the heart, the mind, and the personality, the spirit andthe soul have come to life together occupying the same space and then they willgo together into death.The intrepid, daring Gary Zukav, in his book The Seat of the Soul, introduces abrand-new concept to my mind, or rather a concept which I found in my youthfulyears in the Negro Spirituals which confused me because the lyrics suggestedthat pain and joy, weeping and laughing were all together when death came andthat they left together to go into death.The song, however, which often calls God the Soul, informs the listener that theSoul never dies but will continue and bring into life another mind andpersonality as well as other troubles and joys. They would bear the experienceof living until death would relieve them of their responsibility. Then as theydied, Soul or God would continue as it could not die.Zukav, a respectful thinker, is able in his book The Seat of the Soul to showthe reader how human evolution is achieved by the continuity of the Soul and theability of a personality to die and another to be born a little better, a littlestronger, and a little more daring.I don’t know if the poet in Zukav took his hand and bid him tell the hard truthsas easily as willow trees bow gracefully along a brook side. There are somereaders who choose books for summer reading and others for vacationentertainment. The reader who chooses The Seat of the Soul should put the bookon a shelf, near the bed, or on a lamp table which boasts a good strong bulb.I keep my second copy of the book covered in plastic at the kitchen table, so itwill be protected from years of use and so that the olive oil from a just-madesalad will not smudge the cover.After reading Zukav’s book for the tenth time, I still found it outrageous. Iremembered a play I wrote, called And Still I Rise. The two characters in theplay (male and female) have died and found themselves in what they think is awaiting room. A ghoulish creature appears. The male character, named Zebediah,says, “I know who you are. You are the gatekeeper. You will take us to the placewe are supposed to go—heaven or hell.”The female character, Annabel, adds, “I didn’t make it, but I truly tried tolive a good life, clean, kind, fair.”The eerie creature starts a little laugh which turns into huge laughter. Hegazes at the two piteous-looking characters and says, “I am always amazed, evenstartled at the condition of human imagination. You think there is only a heavenor hell. Zebediah and Annabel, in your futures alone, there are possibly eighthundred destinations.”In my play, Annabel and Zebediah, who had been sitting separately, move to eachother without seeming to notice. Suddenly they are close enough to embrace. Andthey do.The lyrics of the nineteenth-century Negro Spiritual areSoon, I will be done with the troubles of the world,The troubles of the world,The troubles of the world,I’m going home to meet my God.No more weeping and wailing,No more laughing and dancing,No more moaning and crying,I’m going home to meet my God.Obviously the poet decided a minutiae of daily life occupies one space and thatthe true Soul of the poet lives in another space which the poet calls God.I suggest to the new Zukav reader to draw close to share this book with someonewho has firm nerve and a wonderful sense of humor, because when Zukav’s ideasstop challenging you, you will laugh with the wonderful laughter of thediscoverer who has found a new continent.No more weeping and wailing.No more weeping and wailing.I’m going home to meet my Soul."},{"pageContent":"FOREWORD TO THE SEAT OF THE SOUL 25TH ANNIVERSARY EDITIONThis 25th Anniversary Edition of The Seat of the Soul fills me with gratitudeand joy. After I finished the manuscript twenty-five years ago, I sat with itwondering whether anyone would read it, and if anyone read it, whether anyonewould understand it. In the midst of these thoughts, another thought appeared,louder and clearer. It said, “Do not be concerned. This arrow will find itsmark.” The Seat of the Soul has now found its way to millions of hearts, and thearrow is still in flight.While writing my first book, The Dancing Wu Li Masters: An Overview of the NewPhysics, I discovered—to my complete surprise—inspiration that came from beyondmy mind, nonphysical intelligences that I could not articulate, and theelectricity of creating consciously with constructive intent. I had neverexperienced anything like this. I loved these experiences, but, for the mostpart, I forgot about them after the book was finished.The Dancing Wu Li Masters—which won the American Book Award forScience—established me as a popularizer of modern science. Many people expectedme to follow it with a sequel, a Son-of-Wu-Li-Masters, that would explain morecutting-edge science. Instead, my next book was about evolution, reincarnation,karma, and the soul. It was about emotional awareness, responsible choice, andintuition. It was about an unprecedented transformation of human consciousnessand the emergence of a new power—authentic power. In short, the new book wasabout a new human species, its new capabilities, and its new potential.This book was The Seat of the Soul. It surprised me more than anyone. Everythingremarkable that touched me briefly while I was writing The Dancing Wu Li Mastersreturned undeniably, unmistakably, irrevocably into my awareness. I discoverednonphysical reality. I am still growing into that discovery. All creativepeople—which is everyone—require commitment and time and courage to grow intotheir insights. Inspiration is one thing. Applying it to your life is another.My friend Maya Angelou tells me that when people tell her, “I am a Christian,”she replies, “Really? Already? I am in my eighties, and I am still trying.” LikeMaya, I am still learning, still striving to apply the most meaningful insightsof my life, and still changing for the better.Reading The Seat of the Soul twenty-five years after it was written was acompletely surprising and deeply fulfilling experience. The book seemed perfect.Every sentence carried meaning for me. Soon, almost the entire book wasunderlined. I was thirsty for the words. They sank into me like water into drysand. They nurtured and soothed me. The blessing that I felt when I was writingthis book returned to me amplified many times. I basked in it. I thought I knewit all. After all, I typed it, edited it, and talked about it for years. Butrereading the book showed me that I had things to remember, more to learn, andmuch more to practice.The Seat of the Soul brought remarkable people into my life. Two of them inparticular touched me more deeply than I could have imagined and continue tosupport me in ways that thrill and surprise me.The first is Linda Francis. I do not remember the first time we met, althoughshe does. We met again a year later at a small retreat where I was speaking. Iremember everything about that meeting. I was surrounded by loving people, and Ifound myself pushing one of them away—Linda. I wanted none of the hugs she gaveso freely. This was my first clue that parts of me were threatened by her, but Iwas not aware enough to recognize it. I could not escape her at the event—forexample, a friend saved a seat for me at a concert, a different friend saved aseat for Linda, and the saved seats were together. I began to share my curiositywith her. Why was I pushing only her away? I shared my intention not to becontrolled by this unusual repulsion. “I will not refuse your love,” I toldher—not romantic love, but the love that she so obviously felt with her friendsat the retreat and that she held out to me as well. At the end of the event,friends invited me to join them for a cold splash in a waterfall. When theysuggested that I invite Linda, I became irritated.Linda! Linda! What is this thing with Linda? Can I not do anything at this eventwithout Linda? When Linda called me a month later to tell me that she was movingto Mount Shasta, California, where I lived—a decision that predated theretreat—I felt frightened and, again, curious. When our friends and I welcomedher to her new home, I was surprised to realize how much I had been lookingforward to her arrival! I was relaxed, comfortable, happy, and open. We began tovisit each other. Some of our talks I enjoyed, and others I did not, but I foundmyself looking forward to each one. Several months later the thought occurred tome, “I think I am in a relationship!” Without the sexual interactions that hadbegun my previous “relationships,” new and different kinds of interactions beganto occur. These were my first experiences of a substantive and deep relationshipfor the purpose of spiritual growth—a spiritual partnership. A half year later,about twenty years ago, she moved into my cabin, and our journey togethercontinues today.In our years together, I have marveled not only that I love Linda—something Idid not think myself capable of when we met—but that I love loving her! This isthe experience that intrigues me. It is as strong in me now as it was when Idiscovered it. Where does that come from?The second person is Oprah Winfrey. She is the instrument that the Universechose to explode me out of the backcountry and into the larger world. I suspectthat nothing less than that explosion could have done it. She took me into herheart, her creativity, and her famous The Oprah Winfrey Show. First, I was arecluse on a mountain, and then, a few months later, I was speaking to tenmillion people monthly. New friends appeared wherever I went in the world,thanking me for a show, smiling at me from a distance. It took me a long time toacknowledge that my life of isolation was over and even longer to welcome it.During each show Oprah and I sat before an eager audience and the company offellow souls around the world. She introduced a theme, asked me some questions,and then, with a gesture of her hand or movement of her face, turned theattention of millions of people toward me. It was terrifying and awesome.“Sacred” and “holy” are better words. When a national magazine pursued me for anarticle, she counseled, “It’s only cotton candy, Gary. Only cotton candy.” Whatcould have described external power better? My adopted Sioux Uncle, Phil Lane,Sr., once told me after watching one of our shows, “Nephew, you are talking likethe old people.” That memory fills me with strength and gratitude. I am gratefulfor Oprah and to the Universe for all of these experiences and more.In the years following my shows with Oprah, Linda and I cofounded the Seat ofthe Soul Institute, gave many events, wrote books, and developed long-term,in-depth programs for small groups. Now our passion for supporting people andspiritual partnerships has grown stronger than ever, but traveling has becometaxing for us, so we have created new digital tools and innnovative ways to usethe Internet, such as an ongoing support program, eCourse, eNewsletters, anonline Spiritual Partnership Community, live videos, and the Web addresses atthe end of the Chapter Study Guides in this book. (Tap them in your eBook ortype them into your browser and they will take you to Web pages that will helpyou further explore, integrate, and apply what you are studying.) You will findall of these and more at SeatoftheSoul.com [http://SeatoftheSoul.com]. Linda andI still enjoy giving live events when possible, including our favorite, theannual The Journey to the Soul summer retreat. I hope that I will meet youpersonally at one of them.The Internet is a reflection in the domain of the five senses of our emergingawareness of our connectedness. It does not create, or even increase, ourconnectedness. It is not possible for us to be more or less connected than weare with one another and Life. Can a flower be more or less connected to itscolor? Let us enjoy this beautiful reflection together and also what itreflects.The most difficult, gratifying, and thrilling experiences I have had sincepublishing The Seat of the Soul have been my experiences of authentic power andcreating authentic power. Spiritual partnerships, richness of cocreation, andawe of Life have slowly replaced my experiences of people as things and mytormenting journeys through anger, jealousy, despair, and unworthiness. I stillencounter parts of my personality that are angry, frightened, jealous, superior,and inferior, but now I see them as opportunities to create authentic power, tochoose anew. If I can do this, you can, too. I know that eventually you will.The transformation of consciousness that is expanding our perception beyond thefive senses, redefining power, and showing us the potential of a UniversalHumanity is proceeding in full force.Each choice of fear—anger, jealousy, vengefulness—is a choice to evolveunconsciously through the painful, destructive consequences that fear creates.Each choice of love—gratitude, patience, appreciation—is a choice to evolveconsciously through the healthy, constructive consequences that love creates.Why not choose the conscious path, the path of joy? Why not journey consciouslyto the seat of your soul—that place where you transform energy into matter withyour intentions—infuse your world with love and live there?All roads lead to home.Gary Zukav"},{"pageContent":"FOREWORD TO THE FIRST EDITIONDuring the years that I was writing The Dancing Wu Li Masters and after, I wasdrawn again and again to the writings of William James, Carl Jung, Benjamin LeeWhorf, Niels Bohr, and Albert Einstein. I returned to them repeatedly. I foundin them something special, although it was not until later that I was able tounderstand that specialness: These fellow humans reached for something greaterthan they were able to express directly through their work. They saw more thanthey could express in the language of psychology or linguistics or physics, andthey sought to share what they saw. It is what they sought to share through themedium of their work that drew me to them.They were mystics. That is my word. They would not use such language, but theyknew it. They feared that their careers might become contaminated by associationwith those who did not work within the scientific model, but in the depths oftheir own thoughts they each saw much too much to be limited by the five senses,and they were not. Their works contribute not only to the evolution ofpsychology, linguistics, and physics but also to the evolution of those who readthem. They have the capability to change those who touch them in ways that alsocannot be expressed directly in the terms of psychology, or linguistics, orphysics.As I came to understand, in retrospect, the magnetic quality that these worksheld for me, I came to understand that what motivated these men was not Earthlyprizes or the respect of colleagues, but that they put their souls and minds onsomething and reached the extraordinary place where the mind could no longerproduce data of the type that they wanted, and they were in the territory ofinspiration, where their intuitions accelerated and they knew that there wassomething more than the realm of time and space and matter, something more thanphysical life. They knew it. They could not necessarily articulate this clearly,because they were not equipped to talk about such things, but they felt it andtheir writings reflected it.In other words, I came to understand that what motivated these men, and manyothers, was in fact something of great vision that comes from beyond thepersonality. Each of us is now being drawn, in one way or another, to that samegreat vision. It is more than a vision. It is an emerging force. It is the nextstep in our evolutionary journey. Humanity, the human species, is longing now totouch that force, to shed that which interferes with clear contact. Much of thedifficulty in doing this lies in the fact that the vocabulary with which toaddress this new force, which is indeed the eternal force, is not yet born.In this moment and in this hour of human evolution, this proper vocabulary andmeans of addressing that which longs to transcend religiosity and spiritualityand assume the position of authentic power is longing to be born. We need togive that which we as a species are now touching consciously for the first timea vocabulary that is not clouded, so that it can be identified clearly in theacts and judgments of the human race, so that it can be seen clearly, and notthrough veils of mystery or mysticism, but simply as the authentic power thatmoves the force fields of this Earth of ours.As a way of talking about what we are and what we are becoming, I have used theterms “five-sensory” and “multisensory.” Multisensory is not better thanfive-sensory. It is simply more appropriate now. As one system of humanexperience winds down and another, more advanced system emerges, the oldersystem may appear by comparison to be lacking, but from the perspective of theUniverse, the language of comparison is not the language of lesser and better,but of limitation and opportunity.The experiences of the multisensory human are less limited than the experiencesof the five-sensory human. They provide more opportunities for growth anddevelopment and more opportunities to avoid unnecessary difficulties. I havecontrasted the experiences of the five-sensory human with the experiences of themultisensory human in each instance to make their differences as clear aspossible, but this does not mean that the five-sensory phase of our evolution,the phase from which we are emerging, is negative in comparison to the phase ofour evolution that we are entering, the multisensory phase. It is simply that itis now no longer appropriate, just as there came a time when the use of candlesbecame inappropriate because of electricity, but the advent of electricity didnot make candle power negative.Who among us is an expert on the human experience? We have only the gift ofsharing perceptions that hopefully can help those on their journey. There is nosuch thing as an expert on the human experience. The human experience is anexperience in movement and thought and form and, in some cases, an experiment inmovement and thought and form. The most that we can do is comment on themovement, the thought, and the form, but those comments are of great value ifthey can help people to learn to move gracefully, to think clearly, to form—likeartists—the matter of their lives.We are in a time of deep change. We will move through this change more easily ifwe are able to see the road upon which we are traveling, our destination, andwhat it is that is in motion. I offer what is in this book as a window throughwhich I have come to see life. I offer this window to you, but I do not say thatit is necessary that you accept it. There are so many ways to wisdom and to theheart. This is our greatest richness, and the one that gives me the most joy.We have much to do together.Let us do it in wisdom and love and joy.Let us make this the human experience.Gary Zukav"},{"pageContent":"Images [../images/00010.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":"Images [../images/00011.jpeg] 1 Images [../images/00011.jpeg]EVOLUTIONThe evolution that we learned about in school is the evolution of physical form.We learned, for example, that the single-celled creatures of the oceans are thepredecessors of all more complex forms of life. A fish is more complex, and,therefore, more evolved than a sponge; a horse is more complex, and, therefore,more evolved than a snake; a monkey is more complex, and, therefore, moreevolved than a horse, and so on, up to human beings which are the most complex,and, therefore, the most evolved Life forms upon our planet. We were taught, inother words, that evolution means the progressive development of organizationalcomplexity.This definition is an expression of the idea that the organism that is best ableto control both its environment and all of the other organisms in itsenvironment is the most evolved. “Survival of the fittest” means that the mostevolved organism in a given environment is the organism that is at the top ofthe food chain in that environment. According to this definition, therefore, theorganism that is most able to ensure its own survival, most able to serve itsself-preservation, is the most evolved.We have long known that this definition of evolution is inadequate, but we havenot known why. When two humans engage one another, they are, in terms oforganizational complexity, equally evolved. If both have the same intelligence,yet one is small-minded, mean, and selfish while the other is magnanimous andaltruistic, we say that the one who is magnanimous and altruistic is the moreevolved. If one human intentionally sacrifices his or her life to save another,by, for example, using his or her own body to shield another from a bullet or aspeeding car, we say that the human who sacrificed his or her life, indeed, wasone of the most evolved among us. We know these things to be true, but they areat variance with our understanding of evolution.Jesus, we are told, foresaw the plot against His life, even to the details ofhow His friends would act and react, yet He did not run from what He saw. Theentirety of humankind has been inexorably shaped by the power and love of Onewho gave His life for others. All who revere Him, and almost all who but knowHis story, agree that He was one of the most evolved of our species.Our deeper understanding tells us that a truly evolved being is one that valuesothers more than it values itself, and that values love more than it values thephysical world and what is in it. We must now bring our understanding ofevolution into alignment with this deeper understanding. It is important that wedo this because our current understanding of evolution reflects the phase ofevolution that we are now leaving. By examining this understanding, we canperceive how we have evolved to now, and what we are now in the process ofleaving behind. By reflecting upon a new and expanded understanding ofevolution, one that validates our deepest truths, we can see what we areevolving into, and what that means in terms of what we experience, what wevalue, and how we act.Our current understanding of evolution results from the fact that we haveevolved until now by exploring physical reality with our five senses. We havebeen, until now, five-sensory human beings. This path of evolution has allowedus to see the basic principles of the Universe in concrete ways. We see throughour five senses that every action is a cause that has an effect, and that everyeffect has a cause. We see the results of our intentions. We see that ragekills: It takes away breath—the Life force—and it spills blood—the carrier ofvitality. We see that kindness nurtures. We see and feel the effects of a snarland a smile.We experience our ability to process knowledge. We see, for example, that astick is a tool, and we see the effects of how we choose to use it. The clubthat kills can drive a stake into the ground to hold a shelter. The spear thattakes a life can be used as a lever to ease life’s burdens. The knife that cutsflesh can be used to cut cloth. The hands that build bombs can be used to buildschools. The minds that coordinate the activities of violence can coordinate theactivities of cooperation.We see that when the activities of life are infused with reverence, they comealive with meaning and purpose. We see that when reverence is lacking fromlife’s activities, the result is cruelty, violence, and loneliness. The physicalarena is a magnificent learning environment. It is a school within which,through experimentation, we come to understand what causes us to expand and whatcauses us to contract, what causes us to grow and what causes us to shrivel,what nourishes our souls and what depletes them, what works and what does not.When the physical environment is seen only from the five-sensory point of view,physical survival appears to be the fundamental criterion of evolution becauseno other kind of evolution is detectable. It is from this point of view that“survival of the fittest” appears to be synonymous with evolution, and physicaldominance appears to characterize advanced evolution.When perception of the physical world is limited to the five-sensory modality,the basis of life in the physical arena becomes fear. Power to control theenvironment, and those within the environment appears to be essential.The need for physical dominance produces a type of competition that affectsevery aspect of our lives. It affects relationships between lovers and betweensuperpowers, between siblings and between races, between classes and betweensexes. It disrupts the natural tendency toward harmony between nations andbetween friends. The same energy that sent warships to the Persian Gulf sentsoldiers to Vietnam and Crusaders to Palestine. The energy that separated thefamily of Romeo from the family of Juliet is the same energy that separates theracial family of the black husband from the racial family of the white wife. Theenergy that set Lee Harvey Oswald against John Kennedy is the same energy thatset Cain against Abel. Brothers and sisters quarrel for the same reason thatcorporations quarrel—they seek power over one another.The power to control the environment, and those within it, is power over whatcan be felt, smelled, tasted, heard, or seen. This type of power is externalpower. External power can be acquired or lost, as in the stock market or anelection. It can be bought or stolen, transferred or inherited. It is thought ofas something that can be gotten from someone else, or somewhere else. Oneperson’s gain of external power is perceived as another person’s loss. Theresult of seeing power as external is violence and destruction. All of ourinstitutions—social, economic, and political—reflect our understanding of poweras external.Families, like cultures, are patriarchal or matriarchal. One person “wears thepants.” Children learn this early, and it shapes their lives.Police departments, like the military, are produced by the perception of poweras external. Badge, boots, rank, radio, uniform, weapons, and armor are symbolsof fear. Those who wear them are fearful. They fear to engage the world withoutdefenses. Those who encounter these symbols are fearful. They fear the powerthat these symbols represent, or they fear those whom they expect this power tocontain, or they fear both. The police and the military, like patriarchal andmatriarchal families and cultures, are not origins of the perception of power asexternal. They are reflections of the way that we, as a species and asindividuals, have come to view power.The perception of power as external has shaped our economics. The ability tocontrol economies, within communities and within nations, and the ability tocontrol the transnational economy of the world, is concentrated in the hands ofa few people. To protect workers from these people, we have created unions. Toprotect consumers, we have created bureaucracies in government. To protect thepoor, we have created welfare systems. This is a perfect reflection of how wehave come to perceive power—as the possession of a few while the majority serveit as victims.Money is a symbol of external power. Those who have the most money have the mostability to control their environment and those within it, while those who havethe least money have the least ability to control their environment and thosewithin it. Money is acquired, lost, stolen, inherited, and fought for.Education, social status, fame, and things that are owned, if we derive a senseof increased security from them, are symbols of external power. Anything we fearto lose—a home, a car, an attractive body, an agile mind, a deep belief—is asymbol of external power. What we fear is an increase in our vulnerability. Thisresults from seeing power as external.When power is seen as external, the hierarchies of our social, economic, andpolitical structures, as well as the hierarchies of the Universe, appear asindicators of who has power and who does not. Those at the top appear to havethe most power and, therefore, to be the most valuable and the least vulnerable.Those at the bottom appear to be the least powerful, and, therefore, to be theleast valuable and the most vulnerable. From this perception, the general ismore valuable than the private, the executive is more valuable than thechauffeur, the doctor is more valuable than the receptionist, the parent is morevaluable than the child, and the Divine is more valuable than the worshiper. Wefear to transgress our parents, our bosses, and our God. All perceptions oflesser and greater personal value result from the perception of power asexternal.Competition for external power lies at the heart of all violence. The secondarygain behind ideological conflicts, such as capitalism versus communism, andreligious conflicts, such as Irish Catholic versus Irish Protestant, andgeographical conflicts, such as Jew versus Arab, and familial and maritalconflicts, is external power.The perception of power as external splinters the psyche, whether it is thepsyche of the individual, the community, the nation, or the world. There is nodifference between acute schizophrenia and a world at war. There is nodifference between the agony of a splintered soul and the agony of a splinterednation. When a husband and a wife compete for power, they engage the samedynamic that humans of one race do when they fear humans of another race.From these dynamics, we have formed our present understanding of evolution as aprocess of ever-increasing ability to dominate the environment and each other.This definition reflects the limitations of perceiving the physical world withonly five senses. It reflects the competition for external power that isgenerated by fear.After millennia of brutality to one another, individual to individual and groupto group, it is now clear that the insecurity which underlies the perception ofpower as external cannot be healed by the accumulation of external power. It isevident for all to see, not only with each newscast and evening paper, but alsothrough each of our countless sufferings as individuals and as a species, thatthe perception of power as external brings only pain, violence, and destruction.This is how we have evolved until now, and this is what we are leaving behind.Our deeper understanding leads us to another kind of power, a power that loveslife in every form that it appears, a power that does not judge what itencounters, a power that perceives meaningfulness and purpose in the smallestdetails upon the Earth. This is authentic power. When we align our thoughts,emotions, and actions with the highest part of ourselves, we are filled withenthusiasm, purpose, and meaning. Life is rich and full. We have no thoughts ofbitterness. We have no memory of fear. We are joyously and intimately engagedwith our world. This is the experience of authentic power.Authentic power has its roots in the deepest source of our being. Authenticpower cannot be bought, inherited, or hoarded. An authentically empowered personis incapable of making anyone or anything a victim. An authentically empoweredperson is one who is so strong, so empowered, that the idea of using forceagainst another is not a part of his or her consciousness.No understanding of evolution is adequate that does not have at its core that weare on a journey toward authentic power, and that authentic empowerment is thegoal of our evolutionary process and the purpose of our being. We are evolvingfrom a species that pursues external power into a species that pursues authenticpower. We are leaving behind exploration of the physical world as our sole meansof evolution. This means of evolution, and the consciousness that results froman awareness that is limited to the five-sensory modality, are no longeradequate to what we must become.We are evolving from five-sensory humans into multisensory humans. Our fivesenses, together, form a single sensory system that is designed to perceivephysical reality. The perceptions of a multisensory human extend beyond physicalreality to the larger dynamical systems of which our physical reality is a part.The multisensory human is able to perceive, and to appreciate, the role that ourphysical reality plays in a larger picture of evolution, and the dynamics bywhich our physical reality is created and sustained. This realm is invisible tothe five-sensory human.It is in this invisible realm that the origins of our deepest values are found.From the perspective of this invisible realm, the motivations of those whoconsciously sacrifice their lives for higher purposes make sense, the power ofGandhi is explicable, and the compassionate acts of the Christ arecomprehensible in a fullness that is not accessible to the five-sensory human.All of our great teachers have been, or are, multisensory humans. They havespoken to us and acted in accordance with perceptions and values that reflectthe larger perspective of the multisensory being, and, therefore, their wordsand actions awaken within us the recognition of truths.From the perception of the five-sensory human, we are alone in a universe thatis physical. From the perception of the multisensory human, we are never alone,and the Universe is alive, conscious, intelligent, and compassionate. From theperception of the five-sensory human, the physical world is an unaccountablegiven in which we unaccountably find ourselves, and we strive to dominate it sothat we can survive. From the perception of the multisensory human, the physicalworld is a learning environment that is created jointly by the souls that shareit, and everything that occurs within it serves their learning. From theperception of the five-sensory human, intentions have no effects, the effects ofactions are physical, and not all actions affect us or others. From theperception of the multisensory human, the intention behind an action determinesits effects, every intention affects both us and others, and the effects ofintentions extend far beyond the physical world.What does it mean to say that an “invisible” realm exists in which the originsof our deeper understandings are located? What are the implications ofconsidering the existence of a realm that is not detectable through the fivesenses, but that can be known, explored, and understood by other humanfaculties?When a question is asked that cannot be answered within the common frame ofreference, it can be classified as nonsensical, or it can be dismissed as aquestion that is not appropriate, or the person who is asking the question canexpand his or her consciousness to encompass a frame of reference from which thequestion can be answered. The first two options are the easy ways out of aconfrontation with a question that appears to be nonsensical or inappropriate,but the seeker, the true scientist, will allow himself or herself to expand intoa frame of reference from which the answers that he or she is seeking can beunderstood.We, as a species, have been asking the questions “Is there a God?”, “Is there aDivine Intelligence?”, and “Is there a purpose to life?” for as long as we havebeen able to articulate questions. The time has now come for us to expand into aframe of reference that allows these questions to be answered.The larger frame of reference of the multisensory human allows an understandingof the experientially meaningful distinction between the personality and thesoul. Your personality is that part of you that was born into, lives within, andwill die within time. To be a human and to have a personality are the samething. Your personality, like your body, is the vehicle of your evolution.The decisions that you make and the actions that you take upon the Earth are themeans by which you evolve. At each moment you choose the intentions that willshape your experiences and those things upon which you will focus yourattention. These choices affect your evolutionary process. This is so for eachperson. If you choose unconsciously, you evolve unconsciously. If you chooseconsciously, you evolve consciously.The fearful and violent emotions that have come to characterize human existencecan be experienced only by the personality. Only the personality can feel anger,fear, hatred, vengeance, sorrow, shame, regret, indifference, frustration,cynicism, and loneliness. Only the personality can judge, manipulate andexploit. Only the personality can pursue external power. The personality canalso be loving, compassionate, and wise in its relations with others, but love,compassion, and wisdom do not come from the personality. They are experiences ofthe soul.Your soul is that part of you that is immortal. Every person has a soul, but apersonality that is limited in its perception to the five senses is not aware ofits soul, and, therefore, cannot recognize the influences of its soul. As apersonality becomes multisensory, its intuitions—its hunches and subtlefeelings—become important to it. It senses things about itself, other people,and the situations in which it finds itself that it cannot justify on the basisof the information that its five senses can provide. It comes to recognizeintentions, and to respond to them rather than to the actions and the words thatit encounters. It can recognize, for example, a warm heart beneath a harsh andangry manner, and a cold heart beneath polished and pleasing words.When a multisensory personality looks inside itself, it finds a multitude ofdifferent currents. Through experience, it learns to distinguish between thesecurrents and to identify the emotional, psychological, and physical effects ofeach. It learns, for example, which currents produce anger, divisive thoughts,and destructive actions, and which currents produce love, healing thoughts, andconstructive actions. In time, it learns to value and to identify with thosecurrents that generate creativity, healing, and love, and to challenge andrelease those currents that create negativity, disharmony, and violence. In thisway, a personality comes to experience the energy of its soul.Your soul is not a passive or a theoretical entity that occupies a space in thevicinity of your chest cavity. It is a positive, purposeful force at the core ofyour being. It is that part of you that understands the impersonal nature of theenergy dynamics in which you are involved, that loves without restriction andaccepts without judgment.If you desire to know your soul, the first step is to recognize that you have asoul. The next step is to allow yourself to consider, “If I have a soul, what ismy soul? What does my soul want? What is the relationship between my soul andme? How does my soul affect my life?”When the energy of the soul is recognized, acknowledged, and valued, it beginsto infuse the life of the personality. When the personality comes fully to servethe energy of its soul, that is authentic empowerment. This is the goal of theevolutionary process in which we are involved and the reason for our being.Every experience that you have and will have upon the Earth encourages thealignment of your personality with your soul. Every circumstance and situationgives you the opportunity to choose this path, to allow your soul to shinethrough you, to bring into the physical world through you its unending andunfathomable reverence for and love of Life.This is a book about authentic empowerment—the alignment of the personality withthe soul—what that involves, how it happens, and what it creates. To understandthese things requires an understanding of things that appear unusual to thefive-sensory human, but they become natural once you understand evolution—thatfive-sensory perception is a journey leading to multisensory perception—and thatyou were not always meant to be five-sensory.1 [part0011.html#footnote-6930-1]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [part0011.html#footnote-6930-1-backlink]. To learn how to apply what you havelearned in this chapter and deepen your experiences, see the Chapter 1 StudyGuide on page 245 [part0034.html#10DJ40-ffe35c2ad53849cca826336987d3fbe4]."},{"pageContent":"Images [../images/00011.jpeg] 2 Images [../images/00011.jpeg]KARMAMost of us are accustomed to the belief that our participation in the process ofevolution is limited to the duration of a single lifetime. This belief reflectsthe perspective of the five-sensory personality. From the point of view of thefive-sensory personality, nothing of itself lasts beyond its lifetime, and thereis nothing in the experience of the five-sensory human that is not of itself.The multisensory human, too, understands that nothing of itself lasts beyond itslifetime, but it is also aware of its immortal soul.The lifetime of your personality is one of a myriad of experiences of your soul.The soul exists outside of time. The perspective of the soul is immense, and theperception of the soul is without the limitations of the personality. Souls thathave chosen the physical experience of life as we know it as a path ofevolution, have, in general, incarnated their energies many times into manypsychological and physical forms. For each incarnation, the soul creates adifferent personality and body. The personality and the body that, for thefive-sensory human, are the experiential entirety of its existence, are, for itssoul, the unique and perfectly suited instruments of a particular incarnation.Each personality contributes, in its own special way, with its own specialaptitudes and lessons to learn, consciously or unconsciously, to the evolutionof its soul. The life of a mother, a warrior, a daughter, a priest; theexperiences of love, vulnerability, fear, loss, and tenderness; the struggleswith anger, defiance, emptiness, and jealousy—all serve the evolution of thesoul. Each physical, emotional, and psychological characteristic that comprisesa personality and its body—strong or weak arms, dense or penetrating intellect,happy or despairing disposition, yellow or black skin, even hair and eyecolor—is perfectly suited to its soul’s purpose.The five-sensory personality is not aware of the many other incarnations of itssoul. A multisensory personality may be conscious of these incarnations, orexperience them, as its own past or future lives. They are in its family oflives, so to speak, but they are not lives that it, itself, has lived. They areexperiences of its soul.From the point of view of the soul, all of its incarnations are simultaneous.All of its personalities exist at once. Therefore, the release of negativitythat occurs in one of the soul’s incarnations benefits not only itself, but allof its soul’s other incarnations also. Because the soul, itself, is not confinedto time, the past of a personality, as well as its future, is enhanced when apersonality releases currents of fear and doubt. As we shall see, the release ofnegativity by a personality benefits a great many other dynamics ofconsciousness as well. Some of these can be perceived by the five-sensory human,but appear to him or her neither as dynamics of consciousness, nor as related tohis or her inner processes, such as the consciousness and evolution of his orher sex, race, nation, and culture. Others extend far beyond the perceptualability of the five-sensory human. A conscious lifetime, therefore, is atreasure beyond value.The personality and its body are artificial aspects of the soul. When they haveserved their functions, at the end of the soul’s incarnation, the soul releasesthem. They come to an end, but the soul does not. After an incarnation, the soulreturns to its immortal and timeless state. It returns once again to its naturalstate of compassion, clarity, and boundless love.This is the context in which our evolution occurs: the continual incarnation andreincarnation of the energy of the soul into the physical arena, into our Earthschool.Why does this happen? Why is it necessary even to speak of personalities andsouls?The incarnation of a soul is a massive reduction of the power of the soul to ascale that is appropriate to a physical form. It is a reduction of an immortalLife system into the framework of time and the span of a few years. It is thereduction of a perceptual system that partakes simultaneously, through directexperience, of countless lifetimes, some of them physical and some of themnonphysical, to the five physical senses. The soul chooses, voluntarily, toundertake this experience in order to heal.The personality is those parts of the soul that require healing, along withthose parts of the soul, such as compassion and love, that the soul has lent tothe process of healing in that lifetime. The splintered aspects of the soul, theaspects that require healing, need to interact in physical matter so that eachpart of the splinteredness can become whole. The personality is like a complexmandala that is formed from these splintered parts in addition to the parts thatare not splintered. It comes directly from the parts of the soul that the soulhas chosen to work on in this lifetime to heal, that need to experience physicalmatter, and those parts that the soul has given to the process of healing inwhich you are involved. Therefore, you can see within a person’s personality thesplintered suffering of the soul from which it was formed, as well as the gracethat the soul has earned, which is the loving part of the personality.Consider how powerful the soul is if it can have a part of itself thatexperiences great love, a part of itself that experiences fears, a part that isperhaps neutral, a part that experiences schizophrenia, and a part that isdramatically compassionate. If any of these parts are incomplete, thepersonality that the soul forms will be out of harmony. The harmoniouspersonality is one in which the soul flows easily through the part of itselfthat is in touch with its physical incarnation.The soul is. It has no beginning and no end but flows toward wholeness. Thepersonality emerges as a natural force from the soul. It is an energy tool thatthe soul adapts to function within the physical world. Each personality isunique because the configuration of energy of the soul that formed it is unique.It is the persona of the soul, so to speak, that interacts with physical matter.It is a product that is formed from the vibrational aspect of your name, thevibrational aspect of your relationship to planets at the time of yourincarnation, and vibrational aspects of your energy environment, as well as fromthe splintered aspects of your soul that need to interact in physical matter inorder to be brought into wholeness.The personality does not operate independently from the soul. To the extent thata person is in touch with spiritual depths, the personality is soothed becausethe energy of consciousness is focused on its energy core and not on itsartificial facade, which is the personality.The personality sometimes appears as a force running rampant in the world withno attachment to the energy of its soul. This situation can be the origin ofwhat we call an evil human being, and it can be the origin of a schizophrenichuman being. It is the result of the personality being unable to find itsreference point, or connection, to its mothership, which is its soul. Theconflicts of a human’s life are directly proportional to the distance at whichan energy of personality exists separately from the soul, and, therefore, as weshall see, in an irresponsible position of creation. When a personality is infull balance, you cannot see where it ends and the soul begins. That is a wholehuman being.What is involved in the healing of a soul?Most of us are accustomed to the idea that we are responsible for some of ouractions, but not all of them. We consider ourselves responsible, for example,for the good deed that brings our neighbor and us together, or for responding toit positively, but we do not consider ourselves responsible for the argumentbetween us and our neighbor, or for responding to it negatively. We considerourselves responsible for having a safe trip if we take the time to check thecondition of the car before starting, but if we speed around a car that, in ouropinion, has been traveling too slowly, and almost cause an accident by doingthat, we consider the other driver to be responsible. If we feed and clotheourselves through our successful business, we credit ourselves. If we feed andclothe ourselves by burglarizing apartments, we blame our difficult childhood.For many of us, being held responsible is equal to getting caught. A friend whoreturns each year to his native Italy told me, with a twinkle in his eye, of adinner out with his family. When the bill came, my friend’s father, who isfastidious, examined each scribbled item. After some study, he deciphered thelast entry and recognized it to be a short expression that translates, roughly,“If it goes, it goes.” He called the waiter and asked, “What is this item?” Thewaiter shrugged, “It didn’t go.” Many of us feel that if a clerk gives us toomuch change, and we take it, our life has been affected only to the extent thatwe have come into an unexpected gain. In fact, each of our acts affects us infar-reaching ways.Every action, thought, and feeling is motivated by an intention, and thatintention is a cause that exists as one with an effect. If we participate in thecause, it is not possible for us not to participate in the effect. In this mostprofound way, we are held responsible for our every action, thought, andfeeling, which is to say, for our every intention. We, ourselves, shall partakeof the fruit of our every intention. It is, therefore, wise for us to becomeaware of the many intentions that inform our experience, to sort out whichintentions produce which effects, and to choose our intentions according to theeffects that we desire to produce.This is the way that we learned about physical reality as children, and that werefine our knowledge of it as adults. We learn the effect of crying when we arehungry, and we repeat the cause that brings us the effect that we desire. Welearn the effect of putting a finger in a light socket, and we do not repeat thecause that produces that effect.We also learn about intentions and their effects through our experiences inphysical reality, but learning that intentions produce specific effects, andwhat those effects are, proceeds slowly when our learning must be done solelythrough the density of physical matter. Anger, for example, causes distance andhostile interactions. If we must learn this solely through physical experience,we may have to experience ten, or fifty, or one hundred and fifty circumstancesof distance from another and hostile interaction before we come to understandthat it is the orientation of anger on our part, the intention of hostility anddistance, and not this particular action or that, which produces the effect thatwe do not want. This is predominantly the way that a five-sensory human learns.The relationship of cause and effect within the domain of physical objects andphenomena reflects a dynamic that is not limited to physical reality. This isthe dynamic of karma. Everything in the physical world, including each of us, isa small part of dynamics that are more extensive than a five-sensory human canperceive. The love, fear, compassion, and anger that you experience, forexample, are only a small part of the love, fear, compassion, and anger of alarger energy system that you do not see.Within physical reality, the dynamic of karma is reflected by the third law ofmotion: “For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.” In otherwords, the great law of karma that governs the balancing of energy within ourevolutionary system is reflected within the domain of physical objects andphenomena by the last of three principles, three laws of motion, that govern thebalancing of energy within physical reality.The law of karma is an impersonal energy dynamic. When its effects arepersonalized, that is, experienced from the point of view of the personality,they are experienced as a reversal in the direction, a coming back to theintender, of the energy of his or her intention. This is how the personalityexperiences the impersonal dynamic that is described by the third law as an“equal and opposite reaction.” The person who intends hatred for othersexperiences the intention of hatred from others. The person who intends love forothers experiences the intention of love from others, and so forth. The GoldenRule is a behavioral guide that is based upon the dynamic of karma. Apersonalized statement of karma would be, “You receive from the world what yougive to the world.”Karma is not a moral dynamic. Morality is a human creation. The Universe doesnot judge. The law of karma governs the balancing of energy within our system ofmorality and within those of our neighbors. It serves humanity as an impersonaland Universal teacher of responsibility.Every cause that has not yet produced its effect is an event that has not yetcome to completion. It is an imbalance of energy that is in the process ofbecoming balanced. That balancing of energy does not always occur within thespan of a single lifetime. The karma of your soul is created and balanced by theactivities of its many personalities, including you. Often a personalityexperiences effects that were created by other of its soul’s personalities, and,conversely, creates energy imbalances that are not able to right themselveswithin its own lifetime. Therefore, without knowledge of its soul,reincarnation, and karma, it is not always possible for a personality tounderstand the significance or the meaning of the events of its life, or tounderstand the effects of its responses to them.For example, a personality that takes advantage of others creates an imbalanceof energy that must be righted by the experience of being taken advantage of byothers. If that cannot be accomplished within the lifetime of this personality,another of its soul’s personalities will experience being taken advantage of byother people. If that personality does not understand that the experience ofbeing taken advantage of by others is the effect of a previous cause, and thatthis experience is bringing to completion an impersonal process, it will reactfrom a personal point of view rather than from the point of view of its soul. Itmay become angry, for example, or vengeful or depressed. It may lash out, orgrow cynical or withdraw into sorrow. Each of these responses creates karma,another imbalance of energy which, in turn, must be balanced. In this way, onekarmic debt has been paid, so to speak, but another, or others, has beencreated.If a child dies early in its life, we do not know what agreement was madebetween that child’s soul and the souls of its parents, or what healing wasserved by that experience. Although we are sympathetic to the anguish of theparents, we cannot judge this event. If we, or the parents of this child, do notunderstand the impersonal nature of the dynamic that is in motion, we may reactwith anger toward the Universe, or toward each other, or with guilt if we feelthat our actions were inadequate. All of these reactions create karma, and morelessons for the soul to learn—more karmic debts for the soul to pay—appear.In order to become whole, the soul must balance its energy. It must experiencethe effects that it has caused. The energy imbalances in the soul are theincomplete parts of the soul that form the personality. Personalities ininteraction are souls that are seeking to heal. Whether an interaction betweensouls is healing or not depends upon whether the personality involved can seebeyond itself and that of the other personality to the interaction of theirsouls. This perception automatically draws forth compassion. Every experience,and every interaction, provides you with an opportunity to look from the pointof view of your soul or from the point of view of your personality.What does this mean in practical terms? How does a personality begin to lookbeyond itself and to see its soul in interaction with the souls of others?Since we cannot know what is being healed through each interaction—what karmicdebts are coming to conclusion—we cannot judge what we see. For example, when wesee a person sleeping in the gutter in the winter, we do not know what is beingcompleted for that soul. We do not know whether that soul has engaged in crueltyin another lifetime, and now has chosen to experience the same dynamic from anentirely different point of view, as, for example, the recipient of charity. Itis appropriate that we respond to his or her circumstance with compassion, butit is not appropriate that we perceive it as unfair, because it is not.There are personalities that are selfish and hostile and negative, but even inthese cases we cannot fully know the reasons why. These are hidden from view.That does not mean that we cannot recognize negativity when we see it, but wecannot judge it. That is not our place. If we intervene in an argument, or breakup a fight, it is not appropriate that we judge the participants. Of one thingwe can be certain: A person that is engaging in violence is hurting deeply,because a healthy and balanced soul is incapable of harming another.When we judge, we create negative karma. Judgment is a function of thepersonality. When we say of another soul, “She is worthy,” or, “He is notworthy,” we create negative karma. When we say of an action, “This is right,”or, “That is wrong,” we create negative karma. This does not mean that we shouldnot act appropriately to the circumstances in which we find ourselves.If our car is hit by another car, for example, and the driver of the other caris drunk, it is appropriate that the other driver be held responsible, throughthe courts, for the repair of our car. It is appropriate that he or she beprohibited from driving while intoxicated. It is not appropriate that we allowour actions to be motivated by feelings of indignation, righteousness, orvictimization. These feelings are the result of judgments that we make aboutourselves and the other person, assessments through which we see ourselves assuperior to another being.If we act upon these feelings, not only do we increase the karmic obligations ofour soul, but we also are not able to enter into these feelings and learn fromthem. Feelings, as we shall see, are the means through which we can discern theparts of itself that the soul seeks to heal, and through which we come to seethe action of the soul in physical matter. The road to your soul is through yourheart.If we are to engage the viewpoint of the soul, we must cease from judging, eventhose events that appear to be unfathomable, such as the cruelty of aninquisition or a holocaust, the death of an infant, the prolonged agony of adeath by cancer, or a life confined to a bed. We do not know what is beinghealed in these sufferings, or the details of the energetic circumstance that iscoming into balance. It is appropriate that we allow ourselves to feel thecompassion that such circumstances call forth in us and to act upon it, but ifwe allow ourselves to judge these events and those who participate in them, wecreate negative karma that must be balanced, and we, ourselves, will be amongthose souls that choose to participate in circumstances that are necessary tothat balancing.If we do not judge, how can there be justice?Gandhi was beaten several times during his life. Although on two occasions henearly died, he refused to prosecute his attackers because he saw that they weredoing “what they thought was right.” This position of non-judgmental acceptancewas central in Gandhi’s life. The Christ did not judge even those who spit inHis face, and who subjected Him without mercy to His pain and humiliation. Heasked forgiveness, not vengeance, for those who tortured Him. Did neither theChrist nor Gandhi know the meaning of justice?They knew non-judgmental justice.What is non-judgmental justice?Non-judgmental justice is a perception that allows you to see everything inlife, but does not engage your negative emotions. Non-judgmental justicerelieves you of the self-appointed job of judge and jury because you know thateverything is being seen—nothing escapes the law of karma—and this brings forthunderstanding and compassion. Non-judgmental justice is the freedom of seeingwhat you see and experiencing what you experience without responding negatively.It allows you to experience directly the unobstructed flow of the intelligence,radiance, and love of the Universe of which our physical reality is a part.Non-judgmental justice flows naturally from understanding the soul and how itevolves.This, then, is the framework of our evolutionary process: the continualincarnation and reincarnation of the energy of the soul into physical realityfor the purposes of healing and balancing its energy in accordance with the lawof karma. Within this framework we evolve, as individuals and as a species,through the cycle of being unempowered to becoming empowered, yet theexperiences that we encounter in this process need not be the kind that we haveencountered to now.1 [part0012.html#footnote-6930-2]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [part0012.html#footnote-6930-2-backlink]. To learn how to apply what you havelearned in this chapter and deepen your experiences, see the chapter 2 StudyGuide on page 251 [part0035.html#11C3M0-ffe35c2ad53849cca826336987d3fbe4]."},{"pageContent":"Images [../images/00011.jpeg] 3 Images [../images/00011.jpeg]REVERENCEThe framework of karma and reincarnation in which we evolve is neutral. Actionsand reactions in the physical arena set energy into motion, forming ourexperiences and revealing in the process the lessons that the soul has yet tolearn. When our actions create discord in another person, we, ourselves, in thislifetime or in another, will feel that discord. Likewise, if our actions createharmony and empowerment in another, we also will come to feel that harmony andempowerment. This allows us to experience the effects of what we have created,and thereby to learn to create responsibly.The framework of karma and reincarnation is impersonal, and provides for eachsoul, in response to the actions of its personalities, the experiences that itrequires in order to evolve. Therefore, the orientation, or the attitude, withwhich a personality approaches the evolutionary process determines the nature ofthe experiences that will be required for the evolution of its soul. An angrypersonality, for example, will respond to the difficulties of its life withanger, and thereby bring into being the necessity of experiencing the results ofanger; a sorrowful personality will respond sorrowfully and bring into being thenecessity of experiencing the results of sorrow, and so on.A person who is angry, and yet reveres Life, however, will respond verydifferently to the difficulties of his or her life than a person who is angryand has no reverence for Life. The person who has no reverence for Life will nothesitate to strike out against Life. The violence that is released in killinganother person, or another living creature, is much greater than the violencethat is released in speaking angry words. The karmic obligation—the energyimbalance—that is created by killing can be balanced only by the experience of acommensurate brutality. Thus, a person who is reverent will automatically bespared the severe karmic consequences of one who is not.Even if all of our species were reverent, that would not end the need for us tomove through our own evolution. It would just change the quality of thelearnings within the process of evolution. In other words, if we became reverentthis day, we would not be exempt from the demands of our evolution, but thequality of the experiences that we would encounter would be different. We wouldnot harm Life. We would still learn the same thing, but in the process oflearning, we would not seek to harm or to destroy. Our journey frompowerlessness to authentic empowerment would continue, but the nature of thatexperience would change. We would not encounter the types of experiences thatresult from a perception of the world that lacks reverence.We see Life as cheap. This perception pervades all of our perceptions. When welook at the animal kingdom, for example, we see the activities within thiskingdom as verification of our evaluation of Life. We see animals kill and feedupon other animals, and we conclude that weaker forms of Life exist only tonourish the stronger. We justify our exploitation of Life upon what we perceiveto be the design of Nature. We maim and kill. We create situations in whichmillions of people starve while we store grain in silos and pour milk downdrains. We look upon each other as prey to satisfy our emotional and physicalneeds. We say, “It’s a dog-eat-dog world,” and that to survive in it we musttake advantage of others before they take advantage of us. We look upon Life asa contest that produces winners and losers, and we feel no restraints upon uswhen the needs of other people or other groups threaten us.Our behavior and values are so much shaped by perceptions that lack reverencethat we do not know what it is like to be reverent. When we curse a competitoror strive to disempower another person, we absent ourselves from reverence. Whenwe work to take instead of to give, we labor without reverence. When we strivefor safety at the expense of another person’s safety, we deprive ourselves ofthe protection of reverence. When we judge one person as superior and another asinferior we depart from reverence. When we judge ourselves, we do the samething. Business, politics, education, sex, raising families, and personalinteractions without reverence all produce the same result: human beings usingother human beings.Our species has become arrogant. We behave as though the Earth were ours to dowith as we please. We pollute its land, oceans, and atmosphere to satisfy ourneeds without thinking of the needs of the other life forms that live upon theEarth, or of the needs of the Earth. We believe that we are conscious and thatthe Universe is not. We think and act as though our existence as living forcesin the Universe will end with this lifetime, and that we are responsible neitherto others nor to the Universe.It is not possible for a reverent person to exploit his or her friends,co-workers, city, nation, or planet. It is not possible for a reverent speciesto create caste systems, child labor, nerve gas, or nuclear weapons. Therefore,it is not possible for a reverent person, or a reverent species, to accumulatethe type of karma that such activities create.Why is this? What is reverence?Reverence is engaging in a form and a depth of contact with Life that is wellbeyond the shell of form and into essence. Reverence is contact with the essenceof each thing and person and plant and bird and animal. It is contact with theinterior of its beingness. Even if you cannot sense the interior, it is enoughto know that the form, the shell, is merely an outer layer, and that underneathit the true power and essence of who a person is, or what a thing is, ispresent. That is what is honored in reverence.Process is honored in reverence. The unfolding of Life, the maturation process,the process of growing through and coming into your own empowerment, is aprocess that needs to be approached with reverence.The cycles of Life need to be approached with reverence. They have been in placefor billions of years. They are the reflection of the natural breathing of thesoul of Gaia itself, the Earth consciousness, as it moves its force fields andguides the cycles of Life. If these are revered, how could we look at somethingas exquisite as our Earth’s ecology and do one thing that would risk the balanceof this system?Reverence is an attitude of honoring Life. You do not have to be authenticallyempowered to be gentle with Life or to love Life. There are many people who arenot authentically empowered but who are quite reverent. They would harm nothing.Often it is the case that they are the most compassionate and the most lovingpeople because they have suffered so much.Whether a person is reverent depends essentially upon whether he or she acceptsthe principle of the sacredness of Life, any way that he or she defines sacred.Reverence is also simply the experience of accepting that all Life is, in and ofitself, of value.Reverence is not respect. Respect is a judgment. It is a response to theperception of qualities that we ourselves admire, or have been taught to admire.Qualities that are admired by the people of one culture may not be admired bythe people of another culture, or by the people of a subculture, or by anothergeneration of the same culture. Therefore, what is respected by some people maynot be respected by others. It is possible to respect one person and not respectanother, but it is not possible to revere one person without revering everyperson.Reverence is a perception, but it is a holy perception. The perception ofholiness is not one that we use continually. It is one that we apply toreligion, but not to the process of evolution or the learning process of thehuman Life, and so we do not approach the need to learn and all of the learningexperiences of our lives with regard for their purpose against the background ofspiritual development. Perceiving in this way is true reverence, because itallows you to look at what you are going through and to see it within theframework of the evolution and the maturation of your own spirit. It is truereverence, because it enables you to look at all the evolutions that are takingplace simultaneously with your own, in all of the kingdoms of Life, and fullyappreciate, or at least see very differently, how they unfold.Only when we see through eyes that lack reverence, for example, does the feedingof one animal upon another appear to be a cruel system instead of one wherespecies learn to give to each other, where there is a natural give and take andsharing of the energies between kingdoms. This is ecology: the naturalredistribution of energy between kingdoms. It is only our kingdom, the humankingdom, that wants to warehouse energy, to use much more than it needs and tostore what it does not, so that the balance of the cycle is disturbed sodramatically. If each of us took only what he or she needed for that day, itwould be perfect. Animals do not warehouse like us, except in the case ofanimals that need to for winter.The perception of reverence allows us to see the interdependency of differentspecies from a more comprehensive and compassionate perspective. It allows us tosee the significance of each living creature, and its experiences, to thecompassionate unfolding of the Universe. This perspective is much less likely tocreate violent or destructive responses within us as we grow through our livesbecause it reveals in each moment the value of all Life.Approaching and regarding Life with an attitude of reverence permits theexperience of being unempowered but not cruel. As you work toward becomingreverent, your tendencies toward harming others and other forms of Lifediminish. As you acquire a sense of reverence, you develop a capacity to thinkmore deeply about the value of Life before you commit your energy to action.When you are fully reverent, you cannot harm Life, even though you areunempowered. Without reverence the experience of being unempowered can become avery cruel one because a disempowered person is a frightened person, and if afrightened person has no sense of reverence, he or she will harm or killindiscriminately.Reverence is a level of protection and honor about the process of life so thatwhile a person is maturing toward the journey and through the journey ofauthentic empowerment, he or she harms nothing. Because we have no reverence,our journey to empowerment often includes the experiences of victimizing life.Therefore, there are victims and victimizers. The process of destroying Lifewhile we are learning about Life that has characterized our evolution wouldcease, or at least would be very different, if we approached Life with a qualityof reverence.It is because we have no sense of reverence, no true belief in the holiness ofall Life, that Life is destroyed and tortured, brutalized, starved, and maimedwhile we journey from unempowerment to empowerment. If a sense of reverence werebrought into the process of evolution, then as each of us, and our species,moves through the cycle of being unempowered to becoming empowered, the manylearnings that are contained within that growing process of evolution would notlikely produce violence and fear to the extent that it is now experienced.The destructions of human Life, plant Life, animal Life, and the planet would beconsiderably diminished, or would cease, if there were an active principle ofreverence within our species, if there were the perception within our species,and within each of us, that although we are engaged in evolutionary processesthat require personal learning, that does not authorize us to destroy Life whilewe are learning, or because we are. We would not have the karmic energy ofdestruction, only of learning. Even though learning is contained in destruction,the karmic consequences of participating in violence and destruction are a highprice to pay for it.It is not necessary, in other words, to learn what we need to learn and have itcost somebody his or her life. It is not necessary for progress and theexperience of progress to cost the destruction of nature. It is not necessary,but without a sense of reverence for Life, who cares that it destroys Life?Without reverence, Life becomes a very cheap commodity, as it is upon our planetnow where the entire process and the sacredness of evolution is not regarded,accepted, or honored.If we perceived Life with reverence, and understood our evolutionary process, wewould stand in awe at the experience of physical Life and walk the Earth in avery deep sense of gratitude. As it is, there are billions of human beings whoare filled with regret that they are on the Earth, with overwhelming experiencesof pain, despair, discouragement, depression, starvation, and disease. These arethe things of our planet. They result largely from the fact that so much of thehuman condition is without reverence.Reverence is a perception of the soul. Only the personality can perceive Lifewithout reverence. Reverence is a natural aspect of authentic empowermentbecause the soul reveres all of Life. Therefore, when the personality is alignedwith the soul, it cannot perceive Life except with reverence. Approaching Lifewith reverence not only protects the soul from the karmic obligations that arecreated by personalities that do not honor Life, but it also is a step towardmoving the personality into alignment with the soul because it brings an aspectof the soul directly into the physical environment.What does the decision to approach Life with reverence mean in practical terms?It means challenging the perceptions and the values of a five-sensory world thatlacks reverence. This is not always easy, especially for males who have beentaught values that serve the accumulation of external power. An authenticallyempowered male will not be embarrassed or feel less than fully masculine byshowing concern for Life, and for the many creatures on our planet. That is verymuch the energy of reverence. Therefore, the decision to approach Life withreverence often requires courage, not only of men, but also of women who haveadopted these values.The decision to become a reverent person is essentially the decision to become aspiritual person. There is currently no place for spirituality within science,politics, business, or academia. To a five-sensory personality that lacksreverence, a reverent businessman or businesswoman appears to be competing at adisadvantage, because the range of his or her activities is not unlimited, and areverent politician appears to be unqualified for leadership in a world wherethe only power that is recognized is external power. Yet, to the multisensoryhuman, a reverent businessman or businesswoman is a person who infuses a newenergy into the archetype of entrepreneur, shifting it from a dynamic that ismotivated by profits that are generated by serving others to a dynamic ofserving others that is made possible by profits, and a reverent politician is aperson who challenges the concept of external power, and brings to the politicalarena the concerns of the heart. Therefore, the decision to approach Life withreverence means acting and thinking as a spiritual person in a world that doesnot recognize spirit, and it means moving consciously toward the perceptions ofthe multisensory human.To live with reverence means being willing to say, “That is Life, we must notharm it,” and “Those are our fellow humans, we must not destroy them,” and meanit. It means reexamining the way that we treat the members of the animal kingdomthat serve us so patiently. It means recognizing the rights of the Earth. Thatthe Earth has rights is a concept that is not even present in our species yet.An attitude of reverence is the atmosphere, the environment, in which themultisensory personality evolves. It is a sense of richness and fullness andintimacy of being. It creates compassion and acts of kindness. Withoutreverence, without the perception of the holiness of all things, the worldbecomes cold and barren, mechanical and random at the same time, and thiscreates experiences of alienation and acts of violence. It is not natural for usto live without reverence, because that separates us from the basic energy ofthe soul.Reverence automatically brings forth patience. Impatience is the desire to haveyour needs met first. When your needs are taken care of, do you not then havepatience with the needs of others? A reverent person honors Life in all itsforms and all its activities. It does not think in the terms that are requiredto produce impatience.Reverence permits non-judgmental justice. The soul does not judge, and so thepersonality chooses to bring into physical reality another of its soul’scharacteristics when it chooses to approach Life with reverence. The reverentperson cannot consider himself or herself superior to another person or to anyother form of Life, because the reverent person sees Divinity in all forms ofLife, and honors it.An attitude of reverence facilitates the transition from the logic andunderstanding of the five-sensory human to the higher order of logic andunderstanding of the multisensory human, because, as we shall see, this higherorder of logic and understanding originates in the heart.Without reverence, our experiences are brutal and destructive. With reverence,our experiences become compassionate and caring. We shall come to honor all ofLife sooner or later. Our choices are when that shall happen, and the quality ofexperience that we shall have as we learn.1 [part0013.html#footnote-6930-3]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [part0013.html#footnote-6930-3-backlink]. To learn how to apply what you havelearned in this chapter and deepen your experiences, see the chapter 3 StudyGuide on page 256 [part0036.html#12AK80-ffe35c2ad53849cca826336987d3fbe4]."},{"pageContent":"Images [../images/00011.jpeg] 4 Images [../images/00011.jpeg]HEARTThe logics that have served our five-sensory exploration of physical realitycannot comprehend evolution without time or the influence of the present uponthe past. They cannot meaningfully represent the existence of the soul or adynamic of energy balancing that generates and links many lifetimes. Theyreflect no experiential points of reference beyond those of the five-sensorypersonality. Therefore, the time has come for a higher order of logic andunderstanding.The logics and understandings of the five-sensory personality originate in themind. They are products of the intellect. The higher order of logic andunderstanding that is capable of meaningfully reflecting the soul comes from theheart. The creation of this higher order of logic and understanding, therefore,requires close attention to feelings.The central position of the heart in the higher order of logic and understandingof the multisensory human, and the sensitivity to emotional currents that ischaracteristic of multisensory humans, appear as extraneous to the five-sensorypersonality because they do not serve the accumulation of external power. As wehave come to seek and wield external power consciously, we have come to viewfeelings as unnecessary appendages, like tonsils—useless, but capable ofcreating pain and dysfunction. Thus, the pursuit of external power has led to arepression of emotion. This is true of us as individuals and as a species.The irrelevancy that we attribute to feelings pervades our thinking and ourvalues. We admire the “hard-nosed” businessman who fires employees for the sakeof external power. We reward the military officer who sends himself or others topain and death for the sake of external power. We honor the statesman who is notswayed by compassion.When we close the door to our feelings, we close the door to the vital currentsthat energize and activate our thoughts and actions. We cannot begin the processof understanding the effects of our emotions upon us, our environment, and otherpeople, or the effects of the emotions of other people upon themselves, theirenvironment, and us. Without an awareness of our emotions, we cannot associatethe effects of anger, sadness, grief, and joy—within ourselves or others—withtheir causes. We cannot distinguish between that part of us which is personalityand that part of us which is soul. Without an awareness of our feelings wecannot experience compassion. How can we share the sufferings and the joys ofothers if we cannot experience our own?If we are not intimate with our emotions, we cannot perceive the dynamics thatlie behind emotions, the way that these dynamics work, and the ends that theyserve. Emotions are currents of energy that pass through us. Awareness of thesecurrents is the first step in learning how our experiences come into being andwhy.Emotions reflect intentions. Therefore, awareness of emotions leads to awarenessof intentions. Every discrepancy between a conscious intention and the emotionsthat accompany it points directly to a splintered aspect of the self thatrequires healing. If, for example, your intention to marry causes pain insteadof joy, following the pain will lead you to unconscious intentions. If yourintention to advance in your work causes sorrow instead of satisfaction,following the sorrow will lead you to unconscious intentions.Without an awareness of your emotions you are not able to experience reverence.Reverence is not an emotion. It is a way of being, but the path to reverence isthrough your heart, and only an awareness of your feelings can open your heart.The higher order of logic and understanding of the multisensory personalityreveals connections where no connections are apparent to the five-sensorypersonality, and meaning where no meaning is apparent to the five-sensorypersonality. A five-sensory personality is not able to process fully the data ofits senses. Its perception of reality is segmented. Its experience of theUniverse is partitioned.The five-sensory personality can learn that internal dynamics affect perception,and formulate this as folklore or cliché, such as, “Smile and the world smileswith you.” It can discover regularities within physical reality, and formulatethem as laws, such as, “A body in uniform motion will remain in uniform motionuntil it is acted upon by a force.” Yet, the five-sensory personality is notable to experience the relationships between these domains, and, therefore, isnot able to learn about one from the other. It is not able to experience thesame richness through each.Science, for example, reflects the Divine impulse to become conscious ofrelationships that connect apparently separate aspects of experience. It is thepinnacle achievement of the five-sensory personality, yet when the fruits ofscience are grasped only with the logic and understanding of the five-sensoryhuman, internal dynamics—feelings and intentions—appear to be unrelated to theworld of matter. Neither supernovas nor subatomic decay rates nor anything inbetween appear to be affected by what human beings feel or think.When the discoveries of science are comprehended with the logic andunderstanding of the multisensory human, intimate relationships appear betweeninternal dynamics and regularities that govern physical phenomena. To themultisensory human, for example, “A body in uniform motion will remain inuniform motion until it is acted upon by a force,” reflects not only a dynamicat work within the realm of time and space and matter, but also a deeper dynamicthat works within nonphysical reality as well.How is this?One of my friends in infantry officer candidate school was a tall, affable, andpleasant-looking young man from Kentucky named Hank. Hank and I liked each otherearly on. Several times he lent me his physical strength when my load became tooheavy, and I helped him through intellectual obstacles, such as calculatingartillery trajectories. We shared adventures, and our friendship grew.Upon graduation, we were assigned to different organizations. I lost track ofHank until I ran into him in Saigon. He had been wounded, and due to thebefriending of an Army General, had been assigned to a unit that I camefrequently to visit. While serving in Saigon he met a popular female radioannouncer, and they became engaged. It seemed a perfect match—a tall, handsomecaptain and a beautiful and admired public figure.I again lost track of Hank until I had left the army. He called me to say thathis wife was coming to make an appearance at a resort near me, and he asked meto meet him there. When I met Hank, now a civilian also, he looked troubled, andhis easygoing manner was dampened. He had changed his name to Hal, he told me,and apologized that his wife was unable to join us. We spoke for a while, andwhen I asked him what he was doing with himself, he told me, “Looking for myplace in the sun.”The next news that I heard of Hank/Hal was that he had killed himself. When Iwas later able to meet his widow, she told me a painful story of maritaldifficulties, of Hank’s despondency, and of his suicide. In the yearsimmediately following the Vietnam war, the rate of suicides among Vietnamveterans was significantly higher than the rate of suicides among nonveterans.Therefore, it is likely that Hank, also, was affected adversely by hisexperiences in Vietnam. Yet there was also a more common dynamic at work in myfriend.Hank was not the kind of person to ask himself deeper questions about his life.He did not inquire into the deeper meaning of his existence upon the Earth,because that would have caused him to change his life, and he did not want to dothat. He lived his life without much reflection, and one day he awoke tooverwhelming emptiness and powerlessness.How does my friend’s life relate to the first law of motion, “A body in uniformmotion will remain in uniform motion until it is acted upon by a force”? Whatdoes “uniform motion” mean in terms of a human life, and what is the “force”that alters that motion?The outward events of Hank’s life were not uniform. He grew up on a farm inKentucky, became a military officer, traveled thousands of miles from his home,married a celebrity, and brought his own life to an end. It was the unconsciousquality of the flow of Hank’s life that was uniform in its motion. Neither theexperiences of his childhood nor his military service nor his marriage causedHank to consider seriously the deeper meaning of his existence. The pains andthe joys that flowed through him did not affect his awareness of who he was, orwhat he might become.Hank did not allow himself to follow the experiences of his life to their roots.On the contrary, he feared such a pursuit. As a result, his life floweduniformly unaware, uniformly unconscious, from its incarnation to its release.He experienced the situations that were necessary to the balancing of the energyof his soul, he responded to them in accordance with the conditioning that hehad acquired through the karma of his soul and the environment into which he wasborn, and he created more karma unconsciously with each response.The compassion that Hank brought into the world nurtured many people around him,including me, but he did not allow it to become his center of gravity. Hank madeno effort to move toward his soul. He spent his life attempting to fulfill thewants of his personality, and he became too attached to those wants to attemptto change them. Thus, Hank’s life was a “body in uniform motion” that neverencountered a “force.”What is the “force” that Hank’s life did not encounter?Gregory was a white, middle-class, college-educated man from the Northeast. Hischildhood was emotionally difficult, and he grew up angry, manipulative, andbitter. He was incapable of forming relationships, and his violent temper andargumentative nature kept people at a distance. This further increased Gregory’sdisdain for Life and for other people, but he did not stop to ask what role heplayed in his experiences.When, at last, his temper and his disagreeable disposition caused the woman thathe was living with to leave, Gregory fell into a deep anguish not only becauseof his loss, but also because he recognized in this latest event the repetitionof a long-standing pattern in which he found himself, in each instance,suffering from rejection. He determined to confront both his pain and hispattern. He made arrangements to live in solitude while he searched withinhimself for the deepest causes of his painful life.When he emerged, weeks later, both his perceptions and his values had changed.He began to soften, and, slowly, his old mannerisms dropped away. Over thefollowing years he developed a more sensitive way of being with people. Hiscynicism gave way to an emerging joy, his anger melted, and other people becamecentral to his life. He is a productive person now, and he draws his strengthfrom the contributions that he makes to his fellows.These changes did not come easily to Gregory. His transition from an angry,manipulative, disdainful person to a more caring and considerate person was ajourney through pain that required much courage. Yet, by committing himself tothat journey, he changed his life. From the point of view of Gregory’sconsciousness, the uniform flow of Gregory’s life was altered significantly byhis determination to confront his pain, and was altered further by hisdetermination to cultivate his new perceptions. The “force” that altered the“uniform motion” of Gregory’s life was his decision to enter into his lifeconsciously. Without this decision, Gregory’s life would have continued, as didHank’s, on the unconscious course that his karma, and his responses to thesituations that it generated, would have created for him.Is it appropriate to interpret the first law of motion—which depicts theidealized movement of a physical object—in this way? Is the first law of motion,when it is interpreted in this way, merely a metaphor that conveniently servesto describe a nonphysical dynamic? It is more than that. It is the reflection inphysical reality—in the world of physical objects and phenomena—of a largernonphysical dynamic at work in nonphysical domains. This is the physics of thesoul. When science and its discoveries are understood with the higher order oflogic and understanding of the multisensory human, they reveal the same richnessthat Life, itself, displays everywhere and endlessly.The perception of the multisensory personality is not segmented. Themultisensory human, for example, sees that the paradigms which form the historyof science also reveal a history of the way that our species has seen itself inrelation to the Universe: Ptolemaic astronomy reflects a species that seesitself as the center of the Universe; Copernican astronomy reflects a moresophisticated and interdependent perspective of a species that recognizes itselfas part of the motion of the Universe; Newtonian physics reflects a species thatis confident in its ability to grasp the dynamics of the physical world throughthe intellect; relativity reflects a species that understands the limitingrelationship between the absolute and personalized perceptions of it; andquantum physics reflects a species that is becoming aware of the relationship ofits consciousness to the physical world.In other words, from the point of view of the multisensory human, thediscoveries of science illuminate both inner and outer experiences, physical andnonphysical dynamics. A foundational discovery of optics, for example, is thatwhite and black are not colors, like blue, green, and red. White is acombination of all the colors of the visible spectrum of light, and black is theabsence of that spectrum. In other words, white is an integration of all thevisible forms of radiance, and black is an absence of radiance.What nonphysical dynamics does this discovery illuminate?In European literature, white is associated with purity, goodness, andrightness. It is the symbol of positive and protective energy. Heroes andheroines dress in white. God’s messengers and Heaven are associated with white.Angels are painted in robes of white. Black is associated with evil. Villainswear black. Black is the symbol of destruction. The day that catastrophe strikesis called a black day. Black represents despair, anger, and rage, which areabsences of love, compassion, and forgiveness. A person who feels these thingsis said to be in a black mood.“Dark Ages” are said to be a time when the “light of reason” was absent. Thesuffering of a splintered psyche, a psyche without radiance, is called the “darknight of the soul.” The Devil is called the Prince of Darkness, and Hell is saidto be a place where the Light of God does not reach.Is the perception of white as an integration, or a completion, and black as anabsence, therefore, limited in accuracy or applicability to the physicalphenomena of white light and blackness? No. Language, mythology, religion, andscience of the West each recognize in white a reflection of integration, orwholeness, or completion, and in black a reflection of the absence of this. Themultisensory personality sees directly that each of these ways of understandingreflects the same thing.The five-sensory personality cannot see in this way, and, therefore, its logicsand understandings are not as comprehensive. The nature of wholeness and thelack of it, and the effects of each, are not discernible through the study ofphysical phenomena to a personality that is not able to see that both physicalphenomena and the relationships between them are simultaneously parts of andreflections of larger patterns of life.A personality that is not whole lives in a state of splinteredness, asrepresented by individual colors, or combinations of them. A personality that isnot splintered lives in a state of wholeness, as represented by white light. Apersonality that loses touch with its soul, that loses the source of its Light,is a personality that has become capable of what we call evil, as represented byblackness.What we call evil is the absence of Light, of love, in all cases. When we speakpoetically of Light we associate it with purity, insight, and Divineinspiration. As we shall see, this type of Light is not merely poetical. It isreal.A soul can find it difficult to walk the way of Light through the course of anincarnation. It can find that learning to live in Light is a difficult sojourn.Through the choices that it makes while it is incarnate upon the Earth—thechoice of anger instead of forgiveness, for example, or condemnation instead ofunderstanding—a soul accumulates negative karma. As it leaves its body, itremains enveloped with the quality of Light that it acquired through the choicesthat it made while it was upon the Earth. When that soul has to create anotherpersonality, it will have to create a personality that is drawn from this well.Therefore, it will create a personality of more limitations.A personality with limitations of consciousness will find what we call evil moreattractive than will one with a more expanded awareness. The temptation to walkthat way will be strong for such a personality. All souls are tempted, but anindividual with limitations of consciousness will find it more attractive towalk into the magnetic field of fear because it would not recognize fear forwhat it is. It would accept it as something else, as something that is normal toLife.How we understand evil, therefore, is very significant. Evil needs to beunderstood for what it is: the dynamic of the absence of Light. It is notsomething that one should prepare to battle, to run from, or to outlaw.Understanding evil as the absence of Light automatically requires that we reachfor this thing called Light.Conscious Light is equal to Divinity, to Divine Intelligence. Where there is anabsence of Divine Intelligence, that darkness itself maneuvers. It is simplythat there is darkness, and we stumble in the darkness. The existence indarkness is not permanent. Every soul will eventually be fully enLightened. Asoul with no Light will always come to know Light because there is so muchassistance provided to each soul at all times. There is much Light, as we shallsee, that is continually surrounding such a soul even though it may not be ableto directly penetrate it, and there is much assistance for souls that insistupon living in darkness. The encouragement to take even one thought into Lightis always available. Eventually, they always do.Understanding that evil is the absence of Light does not mean that it isinappropriate to respond to evil.What is the appropriate response to evil?The remedy for an absence is a presence. Evil is an absence and, therefore, itcannot be healed with an absence. By hating evil, or one who is engaged in evil,you contribute to the absence of Light and not to its presence. Hatred of evildoes not diminish evil, it increases it.The absence of Light causes the personality to suffer. There is pain. When youhate, you bring that suffering upon yourself. Hatred of evil affects the one whohates. It makes him or her a hateful person, a person who also has absentedhimself or herself from Light.Understanding evil as the absence of Light does not require you to becomepassive, or to disregard evil actions or evil behavior. If you see a child beingabused, or a people being oppressed, for example, it is appropriate that you dowhat you can to protect the child, or to aid the people, but if there is notcompassion in your heart also for those who abuse and oppress—for those who haveno compassion—do you not become like them? Compassion is being moved to and byacts of the heart, to and by the energy of love. If you strike withoutcompassion against the darkness, you yourself enter the darkness.Understanding that evil is the absence of Light challenges the perception ofpower as external. Can an absence be defeated? An evil person can be arrested,but can evil be arrested? An evil group can be imprisoned, but can evil beimprisoned? A compassionate heart is more effective against evil than an army.An army can engage another army, but it cannot engage evil. A compassionateheart can engage evil directly—it can bring Light where there was no Light.Understanding evil as the absence of Light requires you to examine the choicesthat you make each moment in terms of whether they move you toward Light or awayfrom it. It allows you to look with compassion upon those who engage in evilactivities, even as you challenge their activities, and thus protects you fromthe creation of negative karma. It permits you to see that the place to beginthe task of eliminating evil is within yourself. This is the appropriateresponse to evil.The higher order of logic and understanding that characterizes the multisensoryhuman permits it to learn more quickly than the five-sensory human is able tolearn from what its senses alone tell it, and what its intellect makes of that.We have evolved as far as the intellect will take us. We have explored the scopeand depth of five-sensory reality, and we have discovered the limitations ofexternal power.The next phase of our evolution will take us into the experiences of themultisensory human and the nature of authentic power.This requires the heart.1 [part0014.html#footnote-6930-4]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [part0014.html#footnote-6930-4-backlink]. To learn how to apply what you havelearned in this chapter and deepen your experiences, see the Chapter 4 StudyGuide on page 262 [part0037.html#1394Q0-ffe35c2ad53849cca826336987d3fbe4]."},{"pageContent":"Images [../images/00012.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":"Images [../images/00011.jpeg] 5 Images [../images/00011.jpeg]INTUITIONThe central perception of the multisensory human is that he or she is not alone.The multisensory human does not need to rely solely upon his or her ownperceptions and interpretations of events for guidance, because he or she is inconscious communication with other, more advanced intelligences. This does notmean that the multisensory human is relieved thereby from choosing, in eachinstant, the course of his or her life, but it does mean that the multisensoryhuman has conscious access to compassionate and impersonal help in the analysisof his or her possible choices, their probable consequences, and in theexploration of the different parts of himself or herself.The five-sensory human is not alone either, but the five-sensory human is notaware of the assistance that is continually being given to him or her, and,therefore, cannot draw upon that assistance consciously. The five-sensory humanmust learn primarily through his or her physical experiences, and this learningtakes longer because lessons that are learned in this way must come through thedensity of physical matter. A person that needs to learn the lesson of trust,for example, will experience a distrust of others. This distrust will createmisunderstandings, and these will lead to tensions and unpleasant experiences. Afive-sensory human will continue to experience the unpleasantnesses that resultfrom his or her distrust of others until, in this lifetime or another, he or sherealizes through interactions with others the source of these unpleasantnessesand takes steps to change it.If a person is not able to trust, for example, he or she will interpreterroneously the words and actions of others. If a wife tells her husband thatshe must attend a business meeting, although she would like to be with him, andif her husband is unable to trust, he may take her meaning as a rejection, or asa signal that her work is more important to her than he is. Thismisunderstanding results from his inability to accept what his wife has toldhim, from his inability to trust her. As the wife continually experiences herhusband’s misunderstandings, they generate within her feelings of surprise,sorrow, frustration, anger, resentment, and, eventually, the rejection that herhusband mistakenly perceived. Thus the husband, through the dynamic of distrust,creates his most significant fear.The loss of a mate, or a friend, or a colleague through distrust is not apunishment for distrustfulness. It is the result of refusing to look consciouslywithin oneself at the issue of trust. It is an experience that results fromchoosing repeatedly to distrust instead of to trust. A distrustful person willcreate unpleasant or painful situations until, at last, they bring him or her tothe issue of trust. This may take five painful experiences, or five lifetimes ofpainful experiences, or fifty, but, eventually, this path will lead to andthrough the great lesson of trust.The same dynamic applies to every personality characteristic that is not anexpression of compassion and harmony. An angry personality, for example, willcreate unpleasant, or even tragic situations, until its anger is faced andremoved as a block to its compassion and love, to the energy of its soul. Thesame is true for greedy personalities, selfish personalities, manipulatingpersonalities, and so forth. This is the way that we have evolved until now.A multisensory human can learn more rapidly than a five-sensory human. With thehelp that is available to it, the multisensory personality can understand morequickly the meaning of its experiences, how they come into being, what theyrepresent, and its role in creating them. It does not need to experience twelveor twenty or two hundred painful experiences to learn a major lesson of trust,or responsibility, or humbleness. This does not necessarily mean thatmultisensory personalities do not experience painful situations, but that theyhave the capability of learning more quickly from them than five-sensorypersonalities, and, therefore, are more quickly able to choose more wisely, andwith more compassion.It is not necessary to be capable of voice-to-voice communication, so to speak,to be able to draw upon the sources of guidance and assistance that surroundyou. This way is available to the advanced multisensory human, but the road tothat ability is a joyful one of developing an awareness that wise andcompassionate guidance is always available to you, and learning to incorporateit consciously into your life.How does this happen?The five-sensory personality accepts every impulse and insight as his or herown, as originating within his or her psyche. The multisensory personality knowsthat this is not always the case. Impulses, hunches, sudden insights, and subtleinsights have assisted us on our evolutionary path since the origin of ourspecies. That we have not recognized the guidance that has come to us in thisway is a consequence of seeing reality through only five senses. From thefive-sensory point of view, there is no other place from which insights andhunches can come.From the multisensory point of view, insights, intuitions, hunches, andinspirations are messages from the soul, or from advanced intelligences thatassist the soul on its evolutionary journey. The multisensory personality,therefore, honors intuition in a way that the five-sensory personality does not.To the five-sensory personality, intuitions are curiosities. To the multisensorypersonality, they are promptings from, and links to, a perspective of greatercomprehension and compassion than its own.To the five-sensory personality, intuitive insights, or hunches, occurunpredictably, and cannot be counted upon. To the multisensory personality,intuitive insights are registrations within its consciousness of a lovingguidance that is continually assisting and supporting its growth. Therefore, themultisensory personality strives to increase its awareness of this guidance.The first step to this is becoming aware of what you are feeling. Following yourfeelings will lead you to their source. Only through emotions can you encounterthe force field of your own soul. That is the human passage in a word.The husband who was not able to trust, for example, may have felt anger, orshame, or resentment, or coldness toward his wife when she told him of herbusiness appointment. If he had been able to experience his feelingsconsciously, to detach from them, to observe them as energy currents runningthrough his system, he would have been able to ask himself, “Why does the newsof this business meeting affect me in this way?” This would have allowed him todiscover that his feelings were reflecting a sense of rejection, or of beingless important to his wife than her meeting.If he then had reviewed his wife’s message, he would have seen that she had toldhim that she would have preferred to be with him, but could not. This would haveallowed him to ask, “Then why do I still feel so disturbed?” and this would haveled him to the answer, “Because I do not trust that she actually would prefer tobe with me.” In this way, becoming aware of his feelings, rather thanunconsciously acting them out, would have led him to his issue of trust.Having unearthed so much, he then could have asked himself, “Does my experiencewith my wife support this suspicion that she is not being honest with me?” Ifthe answer to this question had been, “No, my experience is that she is a personof integrity,” the husband could have come to see that the dynamic in motionwithin him did not relate to his wife, although her words triggered it. It wouldhave allowed him to see the actual intention of his wife, and his feelingstoward her would have softened. Her response to him would have been one ofcloseness toward a loving husband, instead of hurt caused by the rejection ofher intimacy by a hostile husband.Had he followed this course, he would not have had to ruin his afternoon, or hismarriage. He would have been able to learn from his emotions, and his questionsabout them, the same lesson that he eventually would learn through theunpleasant experiences that resulted from his lack of trust. He would have beenable to see within the framework of one instance the effects of distrust, andthe effects of trust.Each question that a person asks, such as, “Why does news of this businessmeeting affect me this way?”, “Why do I feel so disturbed?”, and “Does myexperience support my suspicion?”, invokes guidance. Every time you ask forguidance, you receive it. Every time you ask yourself, “What is my motivation?”,you ask the Universe, “Help me to see,” and help comes. You may not always becapable of hearing the answers to your questions when you ask them, and theanswers may not always come in the ways that you expect, but they always come.Sometimes an answer occurs in the form of a feeling—a yes feeling or a nofeeling—sometimes in the form of a memory, or a thought that, at the time, seemsrandom, sometimes in a dream and sometimes in the form of a realization that isprompted by an experience that will occur the next day.No question is unheard, and no question goes unanswered. “Ask and you shallreceive” is the rule, but you must learn how to ask and how to receive.The intellect is meant to expand perceptions, to help you grow in perceptualstrength and complexity, and not to do harm. The experiences of the intellectare experiences of knowledge. Knowledge is power, and for each level ofknowledge, you are held responsible for how you use it. Knowledge that simplycomes into your being and does not in some way or form become processed and usedto the benefit of others can have a seriously detrimental effect upon your body.Karmic obligations that are created by deliberate misuse of knowledge, byknowingly harming or creating discord in another, are greater than those thatare created in ignorance.In a world that understands power as external, the intellect often functionswithout the compassionate influence of the heart. This creates situations inwhich intellectual power is used as a weapon to harm others, to exert willpowerwithout tenderness. When the intellect is used to design or develop or produceweapons, for example, it is not being used as it was intended. When an industry,or a plant, is designed or built or operated without consideration for itseffects upon the Earth, upon human life, and upon the environment, the intellectis not being used as it was intended. When you plan to profit at another’sexpense, you are not using your intellect as it was intended.In a world of five-sensory humans that understand power as external, intuitiveknowledge is not regarded as knowledge, and, therefore, it is not processed. Itis not submitted to the intellect. It is not expanded or studied or madetechnical and disciplined. Just as we were taught to develop and employcognition—to think things through—so, too, can we learn to develop and employintuition—to ask for guidance and receive it. Just as there are technologies todiscipline the mind, such as analytical thinking, studying, repetition, andrespect for the mechanism, so, too, are there techniques to engage anddiscipline the intuition.The first of these is to honor emotional cleansing at all times. If you areemotionally blocked and you cannot, or you do not, know what you feel, or if youhave blocked what you feel so effectively that you become emotionless, youbecome a negative person, and you also create a physically diseased body. Bykeeping your emotions clear, emotional negativity does not reside in you, andyou become lighter and lighter. This opens your intuitive track because itallows you a clear sense of loving. It brings you closer to unconditional loveand renders you harmless. It lightens the quality of your frequency, so tospeak, and therefore the guidance that you receive is clear and unobstructed asit enters your system.This requires that you clear yourself each day of your emotional impacts. Justas you dispose of your physical body wastes and toxins, so, too, dispose of youremotional wastes and toxins by finishing emotionally unfinished business, by notgoing to bed in anger, by seeing that you do not feel contaminated emotionally,and by learning to work with and to honor your emotional currents of energy.The second is a cleansing nutritional program. Being physically toxic interfereswith intuition.The third is to honor the guidance that you receive. Emotional and physicalcleansing leads to intuition, and this leads to learning to respond. You must bewilling to hear what your intuition says and act accordingly. Many people do notwish to hear what can be heard so easily, and, therefore, they deny that theyhear anything.The fourth is to allow yourself an orientation of openness toward your life andthe Universe, to approach the questions in your life with a sense of faith andtrust that there is a reason for all that is happening, and that that reason, atits heart, is always compassionate and good. This is an essential thought thatneeds to be in place in order to activate and cultivate intuition.What is intuition, and how does it work?Intuition is perception beyond the physical senses that is meant to assist you.It is that sensory system which operates without data from the five senses. Yourintuitional system is a part of your incarnation. When you leave your body, youwill leave behind the intuitional system that was developed for you, as you willleave behind your personality, because it will no longer be necessary.Intuition serves many purposes. Intuition serves survival. It prompts you topursue that which has no apparent reason in order to survive. Hunches aboutdanger, for example, about what is risky and what is not, about which street issafe to walk and which is not, or about checking the car under the hood, helpyou to remain in the physical world.Intuition serves creativity. It tells you what book to buy for your project. Ittells you where to meet the colleague that you need to meet, and which ideasfrom one field will complement which ideas from another. It is the hunch that acertain painting should be done in gray, and that another should be done inpurple. It is the sense that an idea that has never been tried before mightwork.Intuition serves inspiration. It is the sudden answer to a question. It is themeaning that takes form in the fog of confusion. It is the Light that comes tothe darkness. It is the presence of the Divine.Intuition can be thought of as a type of wiring that can be used by varioussources. One of these sources is the soul. Intuition is a walkie-talkie, so tospeak, between the personality and the soul. This happens through the higherself.The higher self is the connecting link when the soul speaks to its personality.It is the dialogue between the personality and its immortal self. Thepersonality-soul communication is the higher self experience, but thepersonality does not communicate with the fullness of its soul.All of the energy of the soul does not incarnate. To incarnate, the soul createsa personality from those parts of itself that it wants to heal in the physicalenvironment, and from those parts of itself that it lends to the process ofhealing in that lifetime.So powerful is the energy of the soul that it could not advance into a physicalform without, literally, exploding that form. In the creation of a personality,the soul calibrates parts of itself, reduces parts of itself, to take on thehuman experience. Your higher self is that aspect of your soul that is in you,but it is not the fullness of your soul. It is a smaller soul self. Therefore,“higher self” is another term for “soul,” yet the soul is more than the higherself.Picture a cup, a gallon, and a water tank. The water tank is the soul. An aspectof the soul becomes a gallon. That gallon is still soul, but not the fullness ofthe soul. It is that part of the soul that is on mission, so to speak. Thepersonality is the cup. The cup contacts the gallon, the higher self soul, butnot the full-bodied water tank.Communication between the personality and its soul is an in-house intuitiveprocess. It is a process that is organic to your own internal system. Forexample, decision making, which is your process, can be an intuitive process inwhich you pull data from your mind, your heart, and your intuition, relying uponthe guidance of your higher self. Each of these sources is part of your ownsystem of energy. Your personality and your higher self are of your soul.Intuition also can permit the personality, through its higher self, to receiveinformation from other souls of higher process, souls that are not its own soul.Sources of guidance other than your own higher self can come across on the sameradio station, so to speak. This is not the same as an intuitive process. Thisis a process of receiving guidance through intuitive channels.Receiving information through intuitive channels is significantly different fromreceiving information through intuitive processes. Receiving information throughintuitive processes is cooking at home. Receiving information through intuitivechannels is ordering out.The guidance that the multisensory human receives through intuitive processesand through intuitive channels is as essential for his or her well-being andgrowth as sunshine and clean air. Through his or her intuition, the multisensoryhuman comes to understand and to experience truth consciously.What is truth?Truth is that which does not contaminate you, but empowers you. Therefore, thereare degrees of truth, but, generically, truth is that which can do no harm. Itcannot harm.Higher self connecting to nonphysical teachers produces a level of truth that istrue not just for you, but that would be true for anyone who came into contactwith it. If you subtracted everything that is personal to you from the guidancethat you receive through intuitive channels, there would remain a kernel oftruth that would apply to others, or, at least, the presence of unconditionallove, whereas much of the information that you receive through your ownintuitive process will be effective only for you. This is the difference betweenpersonal truth and impersonal truth. They are both truth, but personal truth isyours, and impersonal truth belongs to all that is, to each person. We needtruth to grow in the same way that we need vitamins, affection, and love.At times, the truth that comes through intuitive processes or through intuitivechannels can be contaminated with your own fear. Here is a place to apply yourintellect. In other words, you might think that you are receiving a clearintuition, but if you examine it rationally, if you take it apart, you will beable to see that you are responding to an insecurity, just as the question “Doesmy experience with my wife support my suspicion?” would have allowed the husbandto see that the origin of his emotional response was an insecurity rather thanthe energy dynamic with his wife. Answers that come through your intuitiveprocesses or through intuitive channels may challenge what you would prefer todo. Your lower self, your personality, will not challenge, but rationalize.It is natural to ascend to a level where you can learn to distinguish betweenthe sources of guidance that you receive. The idea of being guided by truth thatis received intuitively appears unusual to the five-sensory personality. Thepsychology that has been constructed upon the experiences of the five-sensorypersonality does not even recognize intuition in the sense that it recognizes,and studies and seeks to understand, physical perception, affect, and cognition.To the multisensory personality, it is unusual not to rely upon truths that itreceives from its higher self and, through its higher self, from souls that aremore advanced.The personality is never separate from its soul, and the soul and itspersonalities are continually assisted and guided with impersonal compassion andwisdom. This is so for both the five-sensory personality and for themultisensory personality, but the five-sensory personality is not aware of itssoul or the guidance that it receives from its higher self and from moreadvanced souls. The multisensory personality is aware of its soul—it seeks toalign itself with its soul, to become the physical embodiment of its higherself—and it consciously invokes and receives the loving assistance of its ownsoul and of other souls that assist it.1 [part0016.html#footnote-6930-5]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [part0016.html#footnote-6930-5-backlink]. To learn how to apply what you havelearned in this chapter and deepen your experiences, see the Chapter 5 StudyGuide on page 267 [part0038.html#147LC0-ffe35c2ad53849cca826336987d3fbe4]."},{"pageContent":"Images [../images/00011.jpeg] 6 Images [../images/00011.jpeg]LIGHTThe soul is not physical, yet it is the force field of your being. The higherself is not physical, yet it is the living template of the evolved human, thefully awakened personality. The experience of intuition cannot be explained interms of the five senses, because it is the voice of the nonphysical world.Therefore, it is not possible to understand your soul or your higher self oryour intuition without coming to terms with the existence of nonphysicalreality.Knowing in the cognitive sense cannot produce proof of nonphysical reality anymore that it can produce proof of God. Proof of nonphysical reality does notexist in the dimension that the rational mind seeks it. Therefore, when you askfrom the perspective of the five-sensory personality, “Does nonphysical realityexist?” what you really are asking is, “If I cannot prove the existence ofnonphysical reality, do I decide that it is nonsensical? Do I decide that thereis no answer, or do I expand myself to the level at which the answer can begiven?”When a mind asks a question that suggests a different level of truth, no matterwhat the question, expansion has always been the way of the scientist, thepursuer of truth. At one time in our evolution, for example, the question wasasked, “Are there forms of life that are smaller than the eye can see?” From thefive-sensory perception, the answer was, “No.” Someone did not accept thatanswer, and the microscope was invented. Then the question, “Do parts of natureexist that are smaller than what can be seen through a microscope?” was asked,and, again, from the five-sensory perception the answer was, “No,” but we didnot stop, and instead discovered, and developed a rich understanding of, atomicand subatomic phenomena.As we created the tools to see, that which was once considered nonexistentbecame existent, but we had to expand first. The challenge, and the task, forthe advanced or expanding mind is to expand to a level at which questions thatcannot be answered from within the accepted understanding of truth can beanswered.What is nonphysical reality?Nonphysical reality is your home. You came from nonphysical reality, you willreturn to nonphysical reality, and the larger part of you currently resides in,and evolves in, nonphysical reality. The same is true for each of the billionsof human beings upon this planet. Therefore, the majority of your interactionswith other human beings occurs in nonphysical reality. For example, when youthink loving thoughts of someone who is close to you emotionally, such as afamily member, you shift the quality of your consciousness, and this contributesto his or her energy system.If a daughter who harbors resentment toward her father, for example, evolvesinto a deeper understanding of her relationship with him, such as anunderstanding of the karmic role that he has played in activating within her amajor lesson of love or responsibility, and if her intention to heal herself andher relationship with her father is deep and clear, do not think, even for aninstant, that her father is not aware of this, even if she does not speak tohim. He is not aware consciously, but his whole being feels what she is doing.His conscious mind may feel it through sudden moments of sentimentalism aboutthings that he had not thought about before, or he may suddenly look at picturesof his daughter as a young child and feel a pull in his heart even though he isnot consciously aware of why he is feeling what he is feeling or doing what heis doing.You participate in this form of data bank exchange, so to speak, with all thesouls that you are close to, and, to some extent, with all the souls that touchyour life. As you shift your data bank content and the information that you sendto a soul, it is processed through his or her own system. It is at that levelthat the cause and effect of your intentions, the way that you choose to shapeyour energy, influences others.How does this happen?You are a system of Light, as are all beings. The frequency of your Lightdepends upon your consciousness. When you shift the level of your consciousness,you shift the frequency of your Light. If you choose to forgive someone who haswronged you, for example, rather than to hate that person, you shift thefrequency of your Light. If you choose to feel affection, or kinship, with aperson rather than distance or coldness, you shift the frequency of your Light.Emotions are currents of energy with different frequencies. Emotions that wethink of as negative, such as hatred, envy, disdain, and fear have a lowerfrequency, and less energy, than emotions that we think of as positive, such asaffection, joy, love, and compassion. When you choose to replace alower-frequency current of energy, such as anger, with a higher-frequencycurrent, such as forgiveness, you raise the frequency of your Light. When youchoose to allow higher-frequency currents of energy to run through your system,you experience more energy. When a person is despairing, for example, oranxious, he or she feels physically depleted because he or she has merged withan energy current of low frequency. A person in this situation becomes heavy anddull, whereas a joyous person abounds with energy, and feels buoyant, because heor she is running a higher-frequency current of energy through his or hersystem.Different thoughts create different emotions. Thoughts of vengeance, violence,and greed, or thoughts of using others, for example, create emotions such asanger, hatred, jealousy, and fear. These are low-frequency currents of energy,and, therefore, they lower the frequency of your Light, or consciousness.Creative or loving or caring thoughts invoke high-frequency emotions, such asappreciation, forgiveness, and joy, and raise the frequency of your system. Ifyour thoughts are thoughts that draw low-frequency energy currents to you, yourphysical and emotional attitudes will deteriorate, and emotional or physicaldisease will follow, whereas thoughts that draw high-frequency energy currentsto you create physical and emotional health.Lower-frequency systems pull energy from higher-frequency systems. If you areunaware of your emotions and your thoughts, your frequency will be loweredby—you will lose energy to—a system of lower frequency than your own. We say,for example, that a depressed person is “draining,” or that he or she “sucks upenergy.” A system of sufficiently high frequency will soothe, or calm, orrefresh you because of the effect of the quality of its Light upon your system.Such a system is “radiant.”By choosing your thoughts, and by selecting which emotional currents you willrelease and which you will reinforce, you determine the quality of your Light.You determine the effects that you will have upon others, and the nature of theexperiences of your life.“Light” represents consciousness. When we do not understand a thing, we say thatwe must “bring it to light.” If we are confused, we say that our process “needsmore light.” When a sudden idea reorders our thoughts, we say that the “lightcame on,” and when a person is fully conscious, we say that he or she is“enlightened.” When you release a negative thought, or a negative feeling, yourelease lower-frequency currents of energy from your system, and this,literally, allows an increase in the frequency of your consciousness.Thinking of the Universe in terms of light, frequencies, and energies ofdifferent frequencies—in the terms that have become familiar to us through thestudy of physical light—is not merely metaphorical. It is a natural and powerfulway to think of the Universe because physical light is a reflection ofnonphysical Light.Physical light is not the Light of your soul. Physical light travels at acertain velocity. It cannot go faster. The Light of your soul is instantaneous.There is no time between a daughter’s loving intention toward her father and thesoul of her father understanding that intention. Instantaneousness, therefore,is very much a part of your life. In nonphysical reality, the decisions that youmake in terms of how you choose to use your energy have effects that areinstantaneous. They are one with who and what you are.Energies that emanate from your soul have instantaneousness to them. Energiesthat emanate from your personality follow the path of physical light. Fear, forexample, is an experience of the personality. The soul can be confused and awayfrom Light, but it does not experience fear. If the soul experiences an absenceof Light from a part of itself, the personality will experience this absence ofLight as fear. That fear is of the personality, and, therefore, of space andtime. Unconditional love is of the soul, instantaneous, Universal, not bound.Just as visible light is one portion, like an octave, in a continuum of energyof graduated frequencies that extends below and above what the eye can see, thecontinuum of nonphysical Light extends below and above, so to speak, thefrequency range in which the human exists. The human experience is a particularfrequency range in the continuum of nonphysical Light in the same way thatvisible light is a particular frequency range in the continuum of physicallight.Other intelligences inhabit other ranges of frequency. These forms of Life donot exist elsewhere from us. Just as infrared light, ultraviolet light,microwave light, and many, many other frequencies and ranges of frequenciescoexist with the visible light spectrum, but are invisible to us, the Life formsthat are characterized by different frequency ranges of nonphysical Lightcoexist with us, but are invisible to us. In the place that you now sit existmany different beings, or groups of beings, each active and evolving in its ownreality and in its own way. These realities commingle with yours in the same waythat microwave radiation exists alongside of visible light, but is undetectableto the human eye.Our species is evolving from one frequency range in the spectrum of nonphysicalLight into another, higher range of frequency. This is the evolution of thefive-sensory personality into the multisensory personality. The multisensorypersonality is more radiant and energetic than the five-sensory personality. Itis aware of the Light of its soul, and it is able to detect, and to communicatewith, forms of Life that are invisible to the five-sensory personality.The Universe is a hierarchy that has no bottom and no top. Between the levels ofthe hierarchy there is an understanding that higher perceptions can be a partof, and are encouraged to be a part of, the experience of lower plane spirits asthey strive to expand their own awareness. Thus, there is always a higher levelof assistance. You are involved in this process, although your personality isunaware of this, because it is done at the level of your soul.There is much that the five-sensory personality is unaware of, and much thateven a fully empowered multisensory personality will not remember until, at theend of its life, it returns to nonphysical reality. You are not aware of themany lifetimes of the past and future personalities of your soul, for example,but the intensity of parts of your being derives directly from these lifetimes,just as do some of your relationships. If an aspect of your being manifestsphysically, such as the aspect of you-as-teacher, or you-as-warrior, then thereare connected nonphysical aspects that are also active and participating in theteaching, or the warring, dynamic from the nonphysical realms of which you are apart and bonded to. The aspect of self that you bring to bear in a physicalmoment represents a force that is many, many times more significant and complex.Our nonphysical assistance comes from ranges of nonphysical Light that arehigher in frequency than our own. The intelligences that assist and guide us,unconsciously in the case of the five-sensory personality, and consciouslyin the case of the multisensory personality, are of a higher rank in creationthan we, and, therefore, can provide us with a quality of guidance andassistance that we cannot give to each other.The five-sensory personality associates rank within a hierarchy with graduatedlevels of worth, and it associates a lower rank within a hierarchy with lessworth, less ability to control others, and more vulnerability. From the point ofview of the Universe, all the ranks of creation are of equal value, all areprecious. When seen through authentically empowered eyes, a being with a higherrank in creation is one that has more ability to see without obstruction, moreability to live in love and wisdom, and more ability and desire to help othersevolve into the same love and Light.Each human soul has both guides and Teachers. A guide is not a Teacher. Guidesare what might be thought of as experts in certain fields that are called in forconsultation. If you are writing a book, for example, or creating a project, ororganizing an event, a guide that has the quality of warmth, or creativity, orinsight that you wish to incorporate into your work is available to you.Teachers operate on a more personal plane of involvement, so to speak, althoughthey are impersonal energies that we personalize, that we feel a personalrelationship with. A nonphysical Teacher brings you ever closer to your soul. Itdraws your attention to the vertical path, and to the difference between thevertical path and the horizontal path.The vertical path is the path of awareness. It is the path of consciousness andconscious choice. The person who chooses to advance his or her spiritual growth,to cultivate awareness of his or her higher self, is on a vertical path. Thevertical path is the path of clarity. The potential for the creation of clarityand the experience of interacting with your nonphysical Teacher are one and thesame.The horizontal path is the path that satisfies your personality. A businessmanor a businesswoman, for example, who devotes his or her life to the accumulationof money is on a horizontal path. No matter how diverse his or her ventures maybecome, they are essentially identical. If they make money, they please thepersonality, and if they lose money, they distress the personality, but they donot serve the higher self. They do not serve his or her spiritual growth.A person that seeks relationships only to gratify his or her own needs, such ashis or her own emotional or sexual needs, will find that each relationship isessentially identical, that the people in his or her life are replaceable, thatexperiences with the first and experiences with the second are essentially thesame. This is the horizontal path. Each new experience is not really new. It ismore of the same thing. To experience relationships of substance and depthrequires approaching and entering into relationships with consciousness andconcern for the other. That is the vertical path.This does not mean that learning does not occur in all situations, and that whena horizontal path is no longer appropriate to a soul’s learning, that soul willnot leave it behind. Sooner or later, each soul will turn toward authenticpower. Every situation serves this goal, and every soul will reach it. Thevertical path begins with the decision to do that consciously.Guides and Teachers assist the soul in every phase of its evolution. The numberof guides and Teachers that a soul has depends upon what it seeks to accomplishand its level of awareness. Souls that take upon themselves projects of moremagnitude bring to themselves more assistance.Your soul knows its guides and Teachers. It drew upon their wisdom andcompassion in charting the incarnation that became you, and that part of yoursoul that is you will be gathered into their waiting arms when the incarnationthat is you comes to an end—when you go home. You receive loving guidance andassistance at each moment. At each moment, you are prompted and encouraged tomove into Light.The decisions that you make are yours to make. A non-physical Teacher cannot,and would not, live your life for you. It will assist you through the learningexperiences of your life. The answers that it can provide you depend upon thequestions that you ask—by questioning your own motivations, by praying ormeditating and remaining open for the answer, or by asking directly, as in thecase of the multisensory human that has developed this ability. When you ask oneset of questions, one set of doorways opens before you, and when you ask otherquestions, other doorways open.In each instance, your Teacher, or Teachers, will advise you with impersonalcompassion and clarity. It will help you to examine the probable results of eachchoice that you make. It will touch your feelings in ways that bring yourawareness to areas that need to be healed. It will answer your questions, butyou must ask them, and, therefore, give direction to your own energy. It willadvise you as to which courses will most likely lead to which results, and itwill continue to advise you with wisdom and compassion no matter what choicesyou make.A Teacher can neither create nor remove karma for you. No being, not even anonphysical Teacher, can assume responsibility for your life, for the way thatyou choose to use your energy, but a nonphysical Teacher can help you tounderstand what your choices and your experiences represent. It can provide youwith the knowledge that will allow you to choose responsibly, and hopefully,choose wisely. Therefore, the ability to draw consciously upon your nonphysicalguidance and assistance, to communicate consciously with a nonphysical Teacher,is a treasure that cannot be described, a treasure beyond words and value.Every decision that you make either moves you toward your personality, or towardyour soul. Each decision that you make is an answer to the question “How do youchoose to learn love?”, “How do you choose to learn authenticempowerment—through doubt and fear, or through wisdom?” This is the heart of theGarden of Paradise story. The Tree of Truth, given unto the entire humanspecies, said, “Learn! Which way do you wish to learn?”This is the ultimate first act of free will: How do you wish to learn? Thequestion continues in every one of your life situations. It is the eternalquestion. It is the longest-running show on Broadway, so to speak. No matterwhat situation, no matter what moment, the Garden of Eden question continues andcontinues and continues. Each time the opportunity in every circumstance inminiature is, “Will you choose the way of doubt and fear, or will you choose theTree of Wisdom?”The Tree of Life, of Knowledge, of Truth, of Wisdom, is an opportunity, anarchetypical question. Adam and Eve, the male and female principles within theGarden of Eden, took the apple symbolically, and misused knowledge. Their choicewas to misuse knowledge, and, therefore, they created shame. That was not partof the human design up to that point. The misuse of knowledge, of truth, ofwisdom, produced embarrassment and shame. That gave rise to guilt. Guilt gaverise to fear, and so began the evolution of the human species.The decision to take the apple was a decision of the highest order of evolution,an order that cannot be conceived, or even grappled with, in the same contextthat we would use to understand a human decision. To speak of decisions in termsof an individual human life, or in the terms of a larger body of individualhuman lives, is very different from speaking about how the role of evolution andlearning began billions of years ago with the human species.The decision to take the apple in the Garden of Eden story does not refer to onedecision that was made by two humans who really existed in such a setting. Itwas not a decision such as you or I would make in terms of, “Do I choose this orthat?” The Garden of Paradise story describes the beginning of the wholeexperience of Earth and the human species. It refers to principles of energythat were brought to bear upon larger bodies of group consciousnesses that hadstress, that had formation energies, creation energies. In their process offorming their own polarities, polarities that would become the polarities of thehuman experience, doubt and fear stood opposing to trust and Light, and so theycame into being.Yet, it is not inappropriate to understand the Garden of Eden story in terms ofhuman choices between doubt and fear on the one hand and wisdom on the other,because the choice to learn through wisdom or through doubt and fear is verymuch part of every single challenge that every single human comes up againstwithin every minute of every day, and this challenge reflects the dynamics that,at a larger level of evolution, were brought to bear upon our evolution.This brings us to the relationship between choice, Light, and physical reality.1[part0017.html#footnote-6930-6]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [part0017.html#footnote-6930-6-backlink]. To learn how to apply what you havelearned in this chapter and deepen your experiences, see the Chapter 6 StudyGuide on page 273 [part0039.html#1565U0-ffe35c2ad53849cca826336987d3fbe4]."},{"pageContent":"Images [../images/00011.jpeg] 7 Images [../images/00011.jpeg]INTENTION INot all forms are physical. A thought, for example, is a form. What is a thoughtformed out of?A thought is energy, or Light, that has been shaped by consciousness. No formexists without consciousness. There is Light, and there is the shaping of Lightby consciousness. This is creation.Energy continually pours through you, entering at the top of your head anddescending downward through your body. You are not a static system. You are adynamic being of Light that at each moment informs the energy that flows throughyou. You do this with each thought, with each intention.The Light that flows through your system is Universal energy. It is the Light ofthe Universe. You give that Light form. What you feel, what you think, how youbehave, what you value, and how you live your life reflect the way that you areshaping the Light that is flowing through you. They are the thought forms, thefeeling forms and the action forms that you have given to Light. They reflectthe configuration of your personality, your space-time being.You change the way that you shape the Light which is flowing through you bychanging your consciousness. You do this, for example, when you challenge anegative pattern, such as anger, and consciously choose to replace it withcompassion, or when you challenge impatience and consciously choose tounderstand and appreciate the needs of others. This creates different forms ofthought, feeling, and action. It changes your experience.Every experience, and every change in your experience, reflects an intention. Anintention is not only a desire. It is the use of your will. If you do not likethe relationship that you have with your husband or with your wife, for example,and you would like it to be different, that desire alone will not change yourrelationship. If you truly desire to change your relationship, that changebegins with the intention to change it. How it will change depends upon theintention that you set.If you intend that your relationship with your husband or your wife becomeharmonious and loving, that intention will open you to new perceptions. It willallow you to see the love that your husband or wife expresses for you in his orher own way, if that is the case. It will allow you to see the absence of thatlove, if that is the case. It will reorient you toward harmony and love so thatyou can see clearly from that perspective what is necessary to change yourrelationship, and if that is achievable.If you intend to end your relationship, that ending begins with the intention toend. This intention will create in you a restlessness. You will feel less andless fulfilled with your mate. You will feel an openness to others in a way thatyou have not felt before. Your higher self has begun the search for anotherpartner. When that partner appears, you will be drawn to him or to her, and, ifyou accept that partner, which also is an intention, a new path will open foryou.If you have conflicting intentions, you will be torn because both dynamics willbe set in motion and oppose each other. If you are not aware of all of yourintentions, the strongest one will win. You may have a conscious intention toimprove your marriage, for example, and, simultaneously, an unconsciousintention to end it. If the unconscious intention to end your marriage isstronger than the conscious intention to improve it, the dynamic ofrestlessness, lack of fulfillment, etc., eventually will overcome the consciousintention to become loving and harmonious within your marriage. In the end, yourmarriage will terminate.If the conscious intention to transform your marriage is stronger than theunconscious intention to end it, and if your husband or your wife is essentiallysupportive, you will succeed, but the dynamic of opposing intentions within youwill produce confusions and anguishes, perhaps for both of you, as you becomeopen to new perceptions of love and harmony within your marriage, and,simultaneously, experience restlessness, lack of fulfillment, and openness toother partners.This is the experience of a splintered personality. A splintered personalitystruggles with itself. The values, perceptions, and behaviors of a splinteredpersonality are not integrated. A splintered personality is not conscious of allthe parts of itself. A splintered personality is frightened. It fears aspects ofitself that threaten what it seeks and what it has attained.A splintered personality experiences the circumstances within its life as morepowerful than itself. A splintered personality that has a conscious intention toimprove its marriage, and a stronger, unconscious intention to end it, forexample, will feel, after the collapse of its marriage, that despite itsefforts, despite even its best efforts, things did not work out as it intended.This is not so. They worked out exactly as it intended, but, because she or heheld conflicting intentions, much turbulence, so to speak, was created in theflow of the Light through that person.If conflicting intentions are nearly balanced, and if a personality is notwilling or able to acknowledge that an aspect, or aspects, of her self or hisself stand opposed to her or his conscious intention, severe stress andemotional pain result. These can cause states of schizophrenia and physicalillness. In less severe cases the anguish can be just as painful.A splintered personality is a personality in need of healing. As a personalitybecomes conscious and integrated, it heals those parts of its soul thatincarnated in order to be healed. The Light that flows through a wholepersonality is focused into a single, clear beam. Its intentions are powerfuland effective. It becomes a laser, a phase-coherent beam of Light, a beam inwhich every wave precisely reinforces every other.A whole personality is not like a laser. A laser is like a whole personality.Lasers are the reflection in physical reality of an energy dynamic that, untilvery recently, has not been central to the human experience. The development ofthe laser in the middle part of the twentieth century reflects within thephysical arena a dynamic that is central to what our species is evolving into.We are evolving into a species of whole individuals, individuals who are awareof their nature as beings of Light, and who shape their Light consciously,wisely, and with compassion. Therefore, the physical phenomenon ofphase-coherent light, light that does not struggle with itself, so to speak, hascome into being. It is a new phenomenon to the human experience, and it reflectsthe new energy dynamic of the whole human. The achievements of science, in otherwords, do not reflect the laboratory capabilities of individuals, or nations,but the spiritual capabilities of our species.Intentions affect more than relationships. Intentions set into motion processesthat affect every aspect of your life. If you desire to change your job, forexample, that change begins with the intention to change. As the intention toleave your present job emerges into your consciousness, you begin to openyourself to the possibility of working somewhere else, or doing something else.You begin to feel less and less at home in what you are doing. Your higher selfhas begun the search for your next job.When the opportunity appears, you are ready to accept it. You may requireadditional time to step into the new situation consciously, to make it your own,because it is human nature to resist change, but, if you accept it, yourintention will manifest physically. It will assume a physical form.Decisions such as where to work and whom to partner with and where to live arenot the only type of decisions that you make, nor are they the decisions thathave the most influence upon your life. At each instant you make decisions inthe form of your attitudes about the Universe, about other people, and aboutyourself. You make these decisions continually and your experiences at eachmoment are created by them. You are a decision-making being.A single choice to challenge your anger and replace it with understanding doesnot immediately change these attitudes, but it brings them, through yourfeelings, into awareness, and as you make the decisions of your life consciouslyand responsibly and wisely, your attitudes come to reflect your decisions.Eventually, the deepest decision-making processes within you—those that shapefrom moment to moment the Light that flows through you—become aligned with whatyou choose consciously, just as they are aligned, before you choose awareness,with what you choose unconsciously.You create your reality with your intentions.How does this happen?Intentions shape Light. They set Light into motion. Each intention—anger, greed,jealousy, compassion, understanding—sets energy into motion, sets patterns ofLight into motion. Physical matter is the densest, or heaviest, level of Light.Physical reality is not a dead and empty stage on which Life evolves. Everyphysical form, as well as every nonphysical form, is Light that has been shapedby consciousness. No form exists apart from consciousness. There is not oneplanet in the Universe that does not have an active level of consciousness,although it may not be what we recognize as consciousness.Physical reality and the organisms and the forms within physical reality aresystems of Light within systems of Light, and this Light is the same Light asthe Light of your soul. Each of these systems of Light is shaped byconsciousness. The physical reality of the Earth school is shaped by thedecisions of those who are in it.What is the relationship between physical reality and the choices that you makein your life?Reality is a multilayered creation. No two people have the same reality.The first layer of your reality is your personal reality. This is your personallife, your personal sphere of influence. Here your decisions are most effective,and are felt directly. By choosing to feel kindness instead of coldness, youchange the frequency of your consciousness, and this changes your experiences.Within your personal reality, you can choose to be selfish or to be giving, tolook upon yourself and others brutally or with compassion, to serve yourself orto serve others and the Earth. Each of these decisions shapes the Light thatflows through you, and creates the reality within you. This reality spills overinto the realities of those around you.The second layer of your reality is your family. When individual human soulscome together, they form a group energy field, a merger of soul energy in agroup. Therefore, the decisions that you make within your personal reality, suchas the decision to be giving or to be selfish, or the decision to be angry or tobe understanding, contribute to the shaping of the reality that you share withyour family. The same is true for each member of your family. Your father’sdependability or drunkenness, for example, contributes to this level of yourreality, as does your mother’s timidness or assertiveness, and your sister’sjealousy or support, etc. As you move into this layer of your reality, you moveinto an atmosphere that includes others within your life. While it is alsopersonal, you are beginning to move outward from the intimacy of your personalreality.The next layer of your reality is your school, or the place where you work. Thislevel of reality is also a co-creation, and is more impersonal than the realitythat you share with your family. Not all of the perceptions that are central toyour personal reality are central to this reality. For example, you may havediscovered that when you pray, you get answers, but this perception is notnecessary to the functioning of your university, or your business. It may not beappropriate to share this perception with the person sitting beside you in thelecture hall, or with the receptionist in the front office.The next layer of your reality includes those people that you come into contactwith in the course of your living, such as the people from whom you buy yourairline tickets, the people at the grocery store, and the bus drivers and themerchants in your town. The beliefs that you hold as a participant in this andother more impersonal layers of your reality also are not all as intimate andpersonal as the beliefs that you hold in your personal reality. In these arenasyou share your personal beliefs that you feel are more aligned with the largergeneral atmosphere of beliefs upon our planet.In other words, as you move outward from your personal reality, you move outwardin bands of energy that are shared by more and more individuals with whom youhave a great deal in common vibrationally. Most individuals, for example,understand “city,” and “urban area.” Most individuals understand “Europe,” and“United States.” These are shared collective perceptions, but they are notshared as widely as the perceptions of “water” and “air,” which are universalperceptions upon our planet.Not all the people on our planet know that there is a place called “Europe.”“Europe” is a majority perception upon our planet, but not a universalperception, such as “air.” Consciously receiving answers to prayers is not amajority perception upon our planet. Therefore, you are free to tell the peopleat the grocery store that you hear answers when you pray, but you may decide notto share that perception for your own sense of safety, because you realize thattheir consciousnesses may not be able to accept that.The next layer of your reality is your town or city, the next is your state, orarea of the country, and the next is your culture, or nation. A nation is anaspect of the personality of Gaia, the Earth’s soul, which, itself, isdeveloping its personality and soulhood. The group dynamic that is the UnitedStates is a personality aspect of Gaia, as is the group dynamic that is Canadaand the group dynamic that is Greenland, and the group dynamic that is eachnation. The individual human souls that participate in the evolution of theseaspects of Gaia form these group energy dynamics and, at the same time, theirown developments are served by the karmic energy properties of these nations.Consider the United States, for example, as simply one unit of energy that isevolving with a particular consciousness. The individual souls that pass throughthis collective consciousness expand it, create actions, create thought forms,create causes and effects, and that is how it accumulates karma. Therelationship of these souls to their nation is like that of cells to a body.Your consciousness affects every cell in your body, and every cell in your bodyaffects your consciousness. There is a mutuality. Each individual in thecollective consciousness that is called the United States can be thought of as acell in that nation, in dialogue.The Earth school and the Earth are not the same. The Earth is a planet. With orwithout humanity, it would be. The purpose of the planet is double, so to speak.It has its own evolution, and part of its evolution includes the housing of aspecies called human. The Earth has agreed to interact with the human species,and to allow the development of this species to merge with its ownconsciousness. Part of this agreement can be understood as an agreement thatmatter will be cocreated upon this planet with the consciousness of the Earth.Since the Earth now has creative residents, it responds to their energy. Ourspecies and the Earth form a mutual response system. This happens in the sameway that Nature exists, and is also a cocreative adventure.As you continue to move outward through the layers of your reality, they becomemore and more impersonal. The next layer of your reality is your race. If youare black, you—your soul—has chosen to participate in the evolution of what itis to be a black human. Your experiences of exhilaration, anger, wisdom, orkindness help to shape this impersonal energy dynamic.The next layer is your sex. If you are female, you have chosen to participate inthe evolution of femininity within the human species.If you look upon this structure as an inverted pyramid, with your personalreality at the bottom, and each layer of your reality above your personalreality as more inclusive and more impersonal, the uppermost layer, the broadestand most impersonal layer, is humanity, the experience of being human.As an individual you participate in group experiences simultaneously with beingan individual, just as you can simultaneously be a man, a father, and a husband,or a woman, a wife, and a mother. These experiences are all simultaneous. Someof them are collective, and some of them are individual. You can have anindividual experience as a father, for example, and an occupation as a baseballplayer with a team. There you participate in a group energy system.You contribute to the creation and the evolution of each of the collectiveconsciousness in which you participate. If a person is French, he or shecontributes to the evolution of the group consciousness that is called French.If a person is Catholic, he or she contributes to the group consciousness thatis called Catholic.In other words, the dynamic of creating reality operates at more than one level.While you are here you participate in the creation of both personal reality andimpersonal reality. Just as you can participate in the creation of a buildingthat will remain long after you are gone, you participate in the evolution ofgroup energy dynamics that will remain after you are gone.Creating a building is a group effort. Several souls participate in theconstruction of that reality. It is built with group energy, and not with justindividual energy. Therefore, it has an existence that is independent of each ofthe individuals that built it. In the same way, you are participating in theevolution of the United States, yet when you die, this place called the UnitedStates will continue.You are connected in layers and through layers to your experience. As youadvance from the individual experience of your own life into the largerexperience of the family of which you are a part, and beyond, you move intodynamics of group energy. The group dynamic of the family is part of the largergroup dynamic of the community, which is part of the larger group dynamic of thenation. Group dynamics advance through the system and the entire system—theentire inverted pyramid—is the soul of the human species.The soul of the human species is sometimes called the collective unconscious,but it is not that. It is the soul of humankind. Your soul is a miniature of thesoul of the human species. It is a micro of a macro. It has as much individualenergy and power. As part of the micro, you have all the power of the macrocalibrated to an individual form of certain frequencies. You form collectiveenergies that help the whole evolve, although they are not themselves souls, anddo not have souls. In between the micro and the macro are the variousexperiences afforded the individual human soul learning within a group,participating in group evolution, such as the evolution of your country, yourreligion, and the individual personal experiences that comprise the humanexperience.As you move down from the top layer of the inverted pyramid to the layer beneathit, your experience reduces from being a part of the whole of human evolution tobeing a part of the evolution of male or female energy. In the next layer down,you become part of the evolution of caucasian, or negro, or mongoloid. In thenext layer down you are part of the evolution of the energy field of the UnitedStates. In the next layer down you are part of the evolution of an individualwhose experiences will include an aspect that participates in the evolution ofmilitary, an aspect that participates in the evolution of teacher, an aspectthat participates in the evolution of father, and so on. Layer by layer, that iswhat the reality of each individual looks like.From the top layer, which is all humanity, all humanness, each layer downwardlocates you more individually and more specifically. The most impersonalconsciousness, the human species, is the first layer. This consciousness thentakes on personal attributes. It is personal that you are part of the UnitedStates. It is personal that you are a white male part of the United States, or abrown female part. These are parts of your personal experience andcharacteristics that serve the evolution of the whole.A university, by analogy, is a group dynamic. Each of the schools of auniversity—undergraduate, business, medicine, law—is also a group energy system,a less inclusive collective of group energy of souls in evolution. What happenswithin the schools affects the whole of the university itself. Then within aparticular school there is the experience of a certain class, which is morepersonal, and after that the experience of the student himself or herself, whichis intimately personal.The reality of each individual is created by his or her intentions and theintentions of others. What we think of as a physical reality that we share is anintermingling, or a formation, a massive overlay of appropriate realities. It isa fluid massive consciousness in which each of us exists independently of eachother and yet coexists interdependently with each other.What we, as a species and as individuals, are now becoming aware of is theeffect of consciousness on this process.1 [part0018.html#footnote-6930-7]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [part0018.html#footnote-6930-7-backlink]. To learn how to apply what you havelearned in this chapter and deepen your experiences, see the Chapter 7 StudyGuide on page 278 [part0040.html#164MG0-ffe35c2ad53849cca826336987d3fbe4]."},{"pageContent":"Images [../images/00011.jpeg]8Images [../images/00011.jpeg]INTENTION IIYou are the product of the karma of your soul. The dispositions, aptitudes, andattitudes that you were born with serve the learning of your soul. As your soullearns the lessons that it must learn to balance its energy, thosecharacteristics become unnecessary, and are replaced by others. This is how yougrow. As you come to realize, for example, that anger leads nowhere, your angerbegins to disappear and you move into a more integrated and mature orientationtoward your experiences. What once angered you now brings forth differentresponses.Until you become aware of the effects of your anger, you continue to be an angryperson. If you do not reach this awareness by the time you return home, yoursoul will continue this lesson through the experiences of another lifetime. Itwill incarnate another personality with aspects that are similar to your own.What is not learned in each lifetime is carried over into other lifetimes, alongwith new lessons that arise for the soul to learn, new karmic obligations thatresult from the responses of its personality to the situations that itencounters. The lessons that the soul has learned also are brought forward intoother lifetimes, and this is how the soul evolves. Personalities mature in time,and the soul evolves in eternity.Your dispositions, aptitudes, and attitudes reflect your intentions. If you areangry, fearful, resentful, or vengeful, your intention is to keep people at adistance. The human emotional spectrum can be broken down into two basicelements: love and fear. Anger, resentment, and vengeance are expressions offear, as are guilt, regret, embarrassment, shame, and sorrow. These arelower-frequency currents of energy. They produce feelings of depletion,weakness, inability to cope, and exhaustion. The highest-frequency current, thehighest energy current, is love. It produces buoyancy, radiance, lightness, andjoy.Your intentions create the reality that you experience. Until you become awareof this, it happens unconsciously. Therefore, be mindful of what you project.That is the first step toward authentic power.You may seek companionship and warmth, for example, but if your unconsciousintention is to keep people at a distance, the experiences of separation andpain will surface again and again until you come to understand that you,yourself, are creating them. Eventually, you will choose to create harmony andlove. You will choose to draw to you the highest-frequency currents that eachsituation has to offer. Eventually, you will come to understand that love healseverything, and love is all there is.This journey may take many lifetimes, but you will complete it. It is impossiblenot to complete it. It is not a question of if but of when. Every situation thatyou create serves this purpose. Every experience that you encounter serves thispurpose.The healing journey of the human soul through its incarnations into the physicalarena is a process of cycles of creation:Karma → personality → intentions + Energy → experiences → reactions → Karma →etc.The karma of the soul determines the characteristics of the personality. Itdetermines the physical, emotional, psychological, and spiritual circumstancesinto which the personality is born. It determines the ways that the personalityis prone to understand its experiences. It determines the intentions with whichthe personality will shape its reality. These intentions create the reality thatprovides the soul, at each moment, with the experiences that are necessary forthe balancing of its energy, and the personality with the clearest choicebetween learning through wisdom or learning through doubt and fear. Throughthese intentions the personality shapes the Light that is flowing through itinto the reality that is optimal for its growth, for the evolution of its soul.The reactions of the personality to the experiences that it has created createmore karma. Reactions express intentions. They determine the experiences thatwill be created next, and the reactions of the personality to those experiencescreate more karma, and so forth, until the soul releases that personality andbody.When the soul returns to its home, what has been accumulated in that lifetime isassessed with the loving assistance of its Teachers and guides. The new lessonsthat have emerged to be learned, the new karmic obligations that must be paid,are seen. The experiences of the incarnation just completed are reviewed in thefullness of understanding. Its mysteries are mysteries no more. Their causes,their reasons, and their contributions to the evolution of the soul, and to theevolution of the souls with whom the soul shared its life, are revealed. Whathas been balanced, what has been learned, brings the soul ever closer to itshealing, to its integration and wholeness.If the soul sees that it is necessary, it will choose, also with the help of itsTeachers and guides, another incarnation. It will draw to itself the guides andTeachers that are appropriate to what it seeks to accomplish. It will consultwith other souls whose evolution, like its own, will be mutually served byinteractions within the physical arena. Then it will undertake again themassive, voluntary reduction of its energy, the infusion of its energy intomatter, the calibration of its energy to an appropriate scale and range offrequencies, that is an incarnation into the learning environment of the Earthschool, and the process begins again.The world as we know it has been built without a consciousness of soul. It hasbeen built with the consciousness of the personality. Everything within ourworld reflects personality energy. We believe that what we can see and smell andtouch and feel and taste is all there is to the world. We believe that we arenot responsible for the consequences of our actions. We act as though we are notaffected when we take and take and take. We strive for external power and inthat striving create a destructive competition.The introduction of consciousness into the cyclic process of creation throughwhich the soul evolves permits the creation of a world that is built upon theconsciousness of the soul, a world that reflects the values and perceptions andexperiences of the soul. It allows you to bring the energy of your soulconsciously into the physical environment. It allows the consciousness of thesacred to fuse with physical matter.The world in which we live has been created unconsciously by unconsciousintentions. Every intention sets energy into motion whether you are conscious ofit or not. You create in each moment. Each word that you speak carriesconsciousness—more than that, carries intelligence—and, therefore, is anintention that shapes Light.When you speak of a “marriage,” for example, you invoke a particularconsciousness, a particular energy. When two people marry, they become “husband”and “wife.” “Husband” means the master of a house, the head of a household, amanager. “Wife” means a woman who is joined to a man in marriage, a hostess of ahousehold. Sometimes it means a woman of humble rank. The relationship between ahusband and a wife is not equal. When two people “marry,” and think and speak ofthemselves as “husband” and “wife,” they enter into these consciousnesses andintelligences.In other words, the archetypical structure of “marriage” can be thought of as aplanet. When two souls marry, they fall into the orbit, or gravitational field,of this planet and, therefore, despite their own individual intentions, theytake on the characteristics of this planet called “marriage.” They become partof the evolution of the structure itself through their own participation in amarriage.An archetype is a collective human idea. The archetype of marriage was designedto assist physical survival. When two people marry, they participate in anenergy dynamic in which they merge their lives in order to help each othersurvive physically. The archetype of marriage is no longer functional. It isbeing replaced with a new archetype that is designed to assist spiritual growth.This is the archetype of spiritual, or sacred, partnership.The underlying premise of a spiritual partnership is a sacred commitment betweenthe partners to assist each other’s spiritual growth. Spiritual partnersrecognize their equality. Spiritual partners are able to distinguish personalityfrom soul, and, therefore, they are able to discuss the dynamics between them,their interactions, on a less emotionally bound ground than husbands and wives.That ground does not exist within the consciousness of marriage. It exists onlywithin the consciousness of spiritual partnership because spiritual partners areable to see clearly that there is indeed a deeper reason why they are together,and that that reason has a great deal to do with the evolution of their souls.Because spiritual, or sacred, partners can see from this perspective, theyengage in a very different dynamic than do husbands and wives. The consciousevolution of the soul is not part of the structural dynamic of marriage. It doesnot exist within that evolution because when the evolutionary archetype ofmarriage was created for our species, the dynamic of conscious spiritual growthwas far too mature a concept to be included. What makes a spiritual, or sacred,partnership is that the souls within the partnership understand that they aretogether in a committed relationship, but the commitment is not to physicalsecurity. It is rather to be with each other’s physical lives as they reflectspiritual consciousness.The bond between spiritual partners exists as real as it does in marriage, butfor significantly different reasons. Spiritual partners are not together inorder to quell each other’s financial fears or because they can produce a housein the suburbs and that entire conceptual framework. The understanding orconsciousness that spiritual partners bring to their commitment is different,and, therefore, their commitment is dynamically different. The commitment ofspiritual partners is to each other’s spiritual growth, recognizing that that iswhat each of them is doing on Earth, and that everything serves that.Spiritual partners bond with an understanding that they are together because itis appropriate for their souls to grow together. They recognize that theirgrowth may take them to the end of their days in this incarnation and beyond, orit may take them to six months. They cannot say that they will be togetherforever. The duration of their partnership is determined by how long it isappropriate for their evolution to be together. All of the vows that a humanbeing can take cannot prevent the spiritual path from exploding through andbreaking those vows if the spirit must move on. It is appropriate for spiritualpartners to remain together only as long as they grow together.Spiritual partnership is a much freer and more spiritually accurate dynamic thanmarriage because spiritual partners come together from a position of spirit andconsciousness. How spiritual partners merge and move their concept ofpartnership is a matter of free will. So long as they recognize that they bringthe consequences of their choices into their partnership, and know the fullextent of their choices, that is what influences the manner and direction thatthe partnership goes.Spiritual partners commit to a growing dynamic. Their commitment is truly apromise toward their own growth, to their own spiritual survival andenhancement, and not to their physical.The archetype of spiritual partnership is new to the human experience. Becausethere is not yet a social convention for spiritual partnership, spiritualpartners may decide that the convention of marriage, reinterpreted to meet theirneeds, is the most appropriate physical expression of their bond. These soulsinfuse the archetype of marriage with the energy of the archetype of spiritualpartnership, as do marriage partners who have discovered in their togethernessthat their bond is actually one of commitment to mutual spiritual growth ratherthan to physical survival or security or comfort.Just as external power is no longer appropriate to our evolution, the archetypeof marriage is no longer appropriate. This does not mean that the institution ofmarriage will disappear overnight. Marriages will continue to exist, butmarriages that succeed will only succeed with the consciousness of spiritualpartnership. The partners in these marriages contribute through theirparticipation in them to the archetype of spiritual partnership.When you bring the consciousness of your soul to your intention-setting process,when you choose to align yourself with your soul instead of with yourpersonality, you create a reality that reflects your soul rather than yourpersonality. When you look upon the experiences of your life as karmicnecessities, when you respond to your experiences as the products of animpersonal energy dynamic rather than the products of particular interactions,you bring the wisdom of your soul into your reality. When you choose to respondto life’s difficulties with compassion and love instead of fear and doubt, youcreate a “heaven on Earth”—you bring the aspects of a more balanced andharmonious level of reality into physical being.The introduction of consciousness into the cyclical processes of creation at thepoint of intention, and at the point of reaction, allows choice. It permits theselection of alternatives. It brings consciousness to the process of evolution.Your intention and attention shape your experiences. What you intend, throughthe density of matter, through the densest level of Light, becomes your reality.Where your attention goes, you go.If you attend to the negative aspects of life, if you choose to focus yourattention on the weaknesses of others, on their faults and shortcomings, youdraw to yourself the lower-frequency energy currents of disdain, anger, andhatred. You put distance between yourself and others. You create obstacles toyour loving. Your energy and influence move slowly through the realm of thepersonality, the arena of time and space and matter. If you direct your energyinto criticism of others with the intention to disempower them, you createnegative karma.If you choose to focus your attention on the strengths of others, on the virtuesof others, on that part of others that strives for the highest, you run throughyour system the higher-frequency currents of appreciation, acceptance, and love.Your energy and influence radiate instantaneously from soul to soul. You becomean effective instrument of constructive change. If your intention is to alignyour personality with your soul, and if you focus your attention upon thoseperceptions that bring to you in each situation the highest-frequency currentsof energy, you move toward authentic empowerment.As you come to recognize the power of your consciousness, that what is behindyour eyes, so to speak, holds more power than what appears in front of them,your inner and outer perceptions change. You cannot become compassionate withyourself without becoming compassionate with others, or with others withoutbecoming compassionate with yourself. When you are compassionate with yourselfand others, your world becomes compassionate. You draw to yourself other soulsof like frequency, and with them you create, through your intentions and youractions and your interactions, a compassionate world.As you come to seek and see the virtues and strengths and nobilities of others,you begin to seek and see them in yourself also. As you draw to yourself thehighest-frequency currents of each situation, you radiate that frequency ofconsciousness, and change the situation. You become more and more and moreconsciously a being of Light.To become aware of the relationship between your consciousness and physicalreality is to become aware of the law of karma, to see it in action. What youintend is what you become. If you intend to take as much from life and others asyou can, if your thoughts are of taking instead of giving, you create a realitythat reflects your intentions. You draw to yourself souls of like frequency, andtogether you create a taking reality. Your experiences then reflect your ownorientation, and validate it. You see the people around you as personalities whotake, rather than personalities who give. You do not trust them, and they do nottrust you.The creative dynamic of intention, the relationship between intention andexperience, underlies quantum physics, our species’ most profound attempt tocomprehend physical phenomena from the perspective of the five-sensorypersonality. Quantum physics was born of an intense and cumulative effort tounderstand the nature of physical light.It is possible to build a device that reveals the wave-like nature of light,that causes light to produce phenomena that can only be produced by waves. It isalso possible to make a device that detects particles of light, as though theywere tiny pellets, and to measure the force of the impact of each particle. Yet,it is not possible for light to be described as a wave phenomenon and a particlephenomenon at the same time. In other words, it is not possible to describe thenature of light—literally, the shape of physical light—apart from theexperimental apparatus that is used to determine it, and this depends upon theintention of the experimenter.The scientific accomplishments of our species reflect our awareness as a speciesof nonphysical dynamics as they unfold within the arena of matter and time,within the realm of the five-sensory personality. The dependency of the form ofphysical light upon the intention of the experimenter reflects in a limited butaccurate manner the dependency of the form of nonphysical Light upon theintentions of the soul that shape it, just as the nature of physical lightitself reflects in a limited but essentially accurate way the nature of theLight of the Universe.The creation of physical experience through intention, the infusion of Lightinto form, energy into matter, soul into body, are all the same. The distancebetween you and your understanding of the creation of matter from energy isequal to the distance that exists between the awareness of your personality andthe energy of your soul. The dynamic of soul and personality is the same dynamicas energy converted into matter. The system is identical. Your body is yourconscious matter. Your personality is the energy of your soul converted tomatter. If it is unaware, it is the splinteredness that is transmitted. If it isaware, it begins to become whole.The dynamic of soul-to-personality, energy-to-matter, lies at the heart of ourcreation mythology, the story of Paradise. Are you not metaphorically within aGarden of Eden, so to speak, your own creative reality, within which you chooseeach day how you will create your reality with the male-female principle insideof you, the Adam and Eve principle, with the Tree representing your personalenergy system, your own cord of knowledge? How will you use your power? Will youcreate Paradise or be Cast Out, as it were?The challenge to each human is creation.Will you create with reverence, or with neglect?1[part0019.html#footnote-6930-8]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [part0019.html#footnote-6930-8-backlink]. To learn how to apply what you havelearned in this chapter and deepen your experiences, see the Chapter 8 StudyGuide on page 283 [part0041.html#173720-ffe35c2ad53849cca826336987d3fbe4]."},{"pageContent":"Images [../images/00013.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":"Images [../images/00011.jpeg] 9 Images [../images/00011.jpeg]CHOICEThe center of the evolutionary process is choice. It is the engine of ourevolution. Each choice that you make is a choice of intention. You may choose toremain silent in a particular situation, for example, and that action may servethe intention of penalizing, sharing compassion, extracting vengeance, showingpatience, or loving. You may choose to speak forcefully, and that action mayserve any of the same intentions. What you choose, with each action and eachthought, is an intention, a quality of consciousness that you bring to youraction or your thought.The splintered personality has several, or many, aspects. One aspect may beloving and patient, another may be vindictive, another charitable, and anotherselfish. Each of these aspects has its own values and goals. If you are notconscious of all of the different parts of yourself, the part of yourself thatis the strongest will win out over the other parts. Its intention will be theone that the personality uses to create its reality. The charitable part of you,for example, may want to see the burglar that was caught in your house givenanother chance, but if the vindictive part of you is stronger, you will, perhapswith mixed feelings, press for his or her arrest.You cannot choose your intentions consciously until you become conscious of eachof the different aspects of yourself. If you are not conscious of each part ofyourself, you will have the experience of wanting to say, or to intend, onething, and finding yourself saying or intending something else. You will wantyour life to move in one direction, and find that it is moving in another. Youwill desire to release a painful pattern from your experience, and see itreappear yet again.It is not easy for a splintered personality to become whole because only someparts of a splintered personality seek wholeness. The other parts, because theyare not as responsible, or caring, or compassionate as the parts that seekwholeness, pull the other way. They seek to create what satisfies them, whatthey have become accustomed to. These parts of the personality are often strongand well established. The splintered personality must always choose betweenopposing parts of itself. This is the backbone situation of our evolution. Thisis the foundational situation—the point of choice.The choice of intention is also the choice of karmic path. If you speak or actfrom anger, for example, you create the karma of anger. If you speak or act withcompassion, you create the karma of compassion, and a different path opensbefore you. This happens whether you are aware of the different parts ofyourself or not, whether even you are aware of the choices that you make at eachmoment. Unconscious evolution through the density of physical matter, throughthe experiences that are created unconsciously by unconscious intentions, hasbeen the way of our species to now. This is the unconscious road to authenticempowerment.Conscious evolution through responsible choice is the accelerated way ofevolution of the multisensory personality, and the five-sensory personality thatis becoming multisensory. Responsible choice is the conscious road to authenticempowerment.What is responsible choice?As you follow your feelings, you become aware of the different parts ofyourself, and the different things that they want. You cannot have all of themat once because many of them conflict. The part of you that wants more money anda bigger house conflicts with the part of you that suffers with the poor andhungry. The part of you that reaches out with compassion toward the beauty inothers conflicts with the part of you that wants to use others for your ownbenefit or gratification. When you satisfy one part of yourself, the needs ofanother go unsatisfied. The fulfillment of one part of you creates anguish inanother, or others, and you are torn.Just as the experimenter in quantum physics cannot produce the experience ofwaves from physical light and the experience of particles from physical light atthe same time, and must choose which experience he or she will create, so you,also, as you shape nonphysical Light must choose which experience you willcreate.As you become conscious of the different parts of your personality, you becomeable to experience consciously the forces within you that compete forexpression, that lay claim to the single intention that will be yours at eachmoment, that will shape your reality. When you enter these dynamics consciously,you create for yourself the ability to choose consciously among the forceswithin you, to choose where and how you will focus your energy.The choice not to choose is the choice to remain unconscious and, therefore, towield power irresponsibly. Awareness of the splintered personality and of itsneed for integration brings with it the need for conscious choice. Each decisionrequires that you choose which parts of yourself you want to cultivate, andwhich parts you want to release.A responsible choice is a choice that takes into account the consequences ofeach of your choices. In order to make a responsible choice you must askyourself, for each choice that you are considering, “What will this produce? DoI really want to create that? Am I ready to accept all of the consequences ofthis choice?” Project yourself into the probable future that will unfold witheach choice that you are considering. Do this not with the energy of intention,but simply to test the water, to get the feel for what you are consideringcreating. See how you feel. Ask yourself, “Is this what I really want?” and thendecide. When you take the consequences of your choice into your decision, andwhen you choose to remain conscious, that is a responsible choice.Only through responsible choice can you choose consciously to cultivate andnourish the needs of your soul, and to challenge and release the wants of yourpersonality. This is the choice of clarity and wisdom, the choice of conscioustransformation. It is the choice of the higher-frequency energy currents oflove, forgiveness, and compassion. It is the choice to follow the voice of yourhigher self, your soul. It is the decision to open yourself to the guidance andassistance of your guides and Teachers. It is the path that leads consciously toauthentic power.How does this happen?You may be aware that deceiving another person is not in alignment with yoursoul, but decide to do that anyway in order to gain a profit, or save arelationship that you are not yet ready to lose. You may know that the path ofcompassion is to share your thoughts and actions, and yet decide not to sharethem because you think that would cost you money, or security. When you choosethe energy of your soul—when you choose to create with the intentions of love,forgiveness, humbleness, and clarity—you gain power. When you choose to learnthrough wisdom, you gain power. When you choose to create with the energy ofyour personality, with anger, jealousy, or fear—when you choose to learn throughfear and doubt—you lose power. You gain or lose power, therefore, according tothe choices that you make.The personality is interested in itself. It likes thrills, so to speak. It isnot necessarily responsible nor caring nor loving. The soul is the energy ofUniversal love, wisdom, and compassion. It creates with these energies. Thepersonality understands power as external; it perceives in terms of competition,threats, and gains and losses that are measured against those of others. Whenyou align yourself with your personality, you give power to the realm of thefive senses, to external circumstances and objects. You disempower yourself. Asyou grow aware of your spiritual self and origin, your immortalness, and youchoose and live according to that first, and the physical second, you close thegap that exists between the personality and the soul. You begin to experienceauthentic power.When you interact in terms of the perceptions of your personality, in terms ofyour five senses, there is an illusion that you do not see. A disagreementbetween two friends, for example, is not so much a disagreement as aspects ofeach surfacing in order to be healed. If they were not souls in agreement, theywould not be together at all. If a father longs to be at the birth of his son,for example, but circumstances take him elsewhere, the perception that he iselsewhere is an illusion. He is with his son. As the personality becomes wholeand empowered, it becomes content to let the illusion play.This is the creation of the dynamic of the soul whereby, no matter whatsituation it is in, it creates the best of all worlds from the power that itdraws to the situation. From the perception of the personality, it is notpossible to see clearly those human beings who, from the outside, appear to bemaking foolish decisions, or to be unaware of their environment, when in truththey are simply drinking from the finest nectar of their environment and aretotally content to let the illusion play.The splintered personality is not content. The contentment that it feels in onemoment is replaced by anger or fear or envy in the next moment as conflictingaspects of itself struggle with each other. Your responses to the strugglesbetween the conflicting aspects of yourself determine the way that you willevolve, consciously or unconsciously, through the experience of negative karmaor positive, through fear and doubt or through wisdom. Your struggles themselvesdo not create karma or determine the way that you will evolve, only yourresponses to them.If your struggle with the conflicting parts of yourself is conscious, you areable to choose consciously the response that will create the karma that youdesire. You will be able to bring to bear upon your decision an awareness ofwhat lies behind each choice, and the consequences of each choice, and chooseaccordingly. When you enter into your decision-making dynamic consciously, youinsert your will consciously into the creative cycle through which your soulevolves, and you enter consciously into your own evolution.This requires effort, but is it really more difficult than living through theconsequences that follow a decision to act in anger, or selfishness, or fearwhen you know that with each decision to act without compassion you yourselfwill experience the discord, or fear, or anguish that you create in another? Isit not worth the effort to project yourself ahead into the probable consequencesof each of your actions, at each point of choice, and see how you will feel ineach instance, how comfortable you will be with each of the consequences, ifdoing that will allow you to harvest love, compassion, and authentic power?The effort that you apply to each decision to align yourself with your soul isrewarded many times. The part of yourself that reaches toward Light may not bethe strongest part of you at the moment that you choose to journey towardauthentic power consciously, at the moment that you choose the vertical path,but it is the part that the Universe backs.When it becomes necessary, for example, for the physical, emotional body of aperson to heal, a dramatic shift in nutrition is often required wherein a personmust release every one of his or her eating habits and take on the habits ofeating certain foods that are much higher in vibration. Ninety percent of theperson’s personality may not want to do that, but the ten percent that ischoosing that path for the sake of health and wholeness has more powerultimately than the ninety percent that is fighting to remain where it is andhave its own way, because the Universe backs that ten percent and not the ninetypercent.Think in terms of what it means to make decisions and try to cause the rest ofyou to fall into alignment with them, of responsible choice, and as you moveinto the healing of who you are and the conscious journey toward what it is youwant, recognize that the Universe backs the part of you that is of clearestintention.You are constantly receiving guidance and assistance from your guides andTeachers, and from the Universe itself. When you choose consciously to movetoward the energy of your soul, you invite that guidance. When you ask theUniverse to bless you in your effort to align yourself with your soul, you opena passageway between yourself and your guides and Teachers. You assist theirefforts to assist you. You invoke the power of the nonphysical world. That iswhat a blessing is: the opening of a passageway between you and nonphysicalguidance.A personality that is conscious of its splinteredness, and struggles consciouslyto become whole, does not need to create negative karma in order to evolve, inorder to learn to create responsibility, in order to acquire authentic power.When you struggle consciously with a choice between the wants of yourpersonality and the needs of your soul, you enter a dynamic through which youare enabled to evolve without creating negative karma. That is the dynamic oftemptation.What is temptation?Temptation is the Universe’s compassionate way of allowing you to run throughwhat would be a harmful negative karmic dynamic if you were to allow it tobecome physically manifest. It is the energy through which your soul is giventhe gracious opportunity to have a dry run at a life lesson, at a situationthat, if you can see clearly, can be removed and healed within the confines ofyour private world of energy and not spill into a larger energy field of othersouls. Temptation is a dress rehearsal for a karmic experience of negativity.The entire dynamic of temptation is the compassionate way of allowing you to seeyour potential pitfalls, and cleanse yourself before you can affect the lives ofothers. It is a form of decoy in which the negativity is compassionately drawnfrom you, if you can see that before you create karma. As you respond to thedecoy, you cleanse yourself by becoming aware and not having to actually livethrough the experience. You cleanse yourself without creating karma andinteraction with other souls. How exquisite is temptation. It is the magnetwhich draws your awareness to that which would create negative karma if it wereallowed to remain unconscious.In other words, temptation is a thought form that is designed to draw possiblenegativity from the human energy system without harming others. The soulunderstands that. Left to its own device it would operate completely within thehuman energy system, without spilling over and contaminating the collectiveconscious.Temptations are not traps. Each temptation is an opportunity through which thesoul is able to learn without creating karma, to evolve directly throughconscious choice. The dynamic of temptation is the energy of what might bethought of as the challenging dynamic of the human experience, as the Lucifericprinciple. It serves the purpose of assisting the evolution of power.Lucifer means “Light bringer.” Temptation, the Luciferic principle, is thatdynamic through which each soul is graciously offered the opportunity tochallenge those parts of itself that resist Light. The Luciferic energy isrepresented in the Garden of Eden story by a snake, by the idea of a presenceother than human that could tempt, but, literally, could not have dominion overthe human being. The Luciferic energy tempts you, tempts the level of humanbeing that is mortal, that is five-sensory, but the snake cannot destroy thesoul. It can merely threaten that part of you that becomes too linked to thephysical. The snake is of the Earth. When you are too close to the Earth, whenyou find yourself honoring the gods of the Earth, and make Earth your god andmaster, then so, too, you shall be bitten.The Light-bringing energy, the Luciferic energy, that tempted the person Jesusof Nazareth who became the Christ, and that tempted the person SiddharthaGautama who became the Buddha, is the same energy that tempts you. It tempts theaccountant to steal, the student to cheat, the spouse to adultery, the humanbeing to external power. It opposes the Light of your immortal soul to thephysical light of your personality. It sets before you the vertical path and thehorizontal path. What is the nature of transformation? It is the compassionateway of temptation.Temptation is the gracious way of introducing each individual to his or herpower. When you are seduced or threatened by external circumstances, you losepower. They gain power over you. With each choice that you make to alignyourself with the energy of your soul, you empower yourself. This is howauthentic power is acquired. It is built up step by step, choice by choice. Itcannot be meditated or prayed into being. It must be earned.When you choose to release anger, for example, you create an energy templatearound which your experiences will form. This energy pattern will draw to thesurface the anger within you in order that you can release it. When you chooseto challenge and to release a negative aspect of yourself, that aspect comes tothe foreground. Everything starts to serve that purpose. Your dreams show youthe archetypical dynamics of your anger. You find yourself continually insituations that generate anger within you. Your life appears to be distortedaround anger, because that is the aspect of yourself that you have chosen tochallenge, and the Universe has responded to your choice with compassion.When you consciously invoke growing, consciously invoke wisdom, you consciouslyinvoke the parts of yourself that are not whole to come into the foreground ofyour life. With each recurrence of anger, or jealousy, or fear, you are giventhe choice to challenge it, or to give in to it. Each time you challenge it, itloses power and you gain power. Each time you are tempted to become angry, orjealous, or fearful, and you challenge that feeling, you empower yourself. Therewould be no accumulation of strength inside if the choices that you make did notrequire discipline and intention.If you decide that you cannot beat a temptation, what you are really doing isgiving yourself permission to be irresponsible. The desires and impulses thatyou feel that you cannot resist, that you lack the power to overcome, are youraddictions. Addictions are the wants of the parts of your personality that arevery strong and resistant to the energy of your soul. They are those aspects ofyour personality, of your soul incarnate, that are most in need of healing. Theyare your greatest inadequacies.Your addiction may be to food, or drugs, or anger, or sex. You may have morethan one addiction. In each instance, you cannot release the addiction until youunderstand the dynamic that underlies it. Beneath every addiction is theperception of power as external, as the ability to control and use theenvironment or others. Beneath every addiction is an issue of power.The journey to the soul begins with understanding that we are drawnautomatically as a species to come to terms with power. Each human being isexperiencing the causes and effects of his or her choices, his or her desires tofill in the empty, powerless places within him or her. This dynamic can bedescribed in terms of an insecure humanity, but that is just the obvious. Themechanism at work is the journey toward genuine, authentic empowerment.This is why each human being struggles so deeply with power: the lack of it, theacquisition of it, what it is really, how one should have it. Underlying everycrisis, emotional, spiritual, physical, and psychological, is the issue ofpower. Depending upon the lens that you wear to interpret your crisis, you willeither step closer to your soul or closer to the Earth.The journey to wholeness requires that you look honestly, openly, and withcourage into yourself, into the dynamics that lie behind what you feel, what youperceive, what you value, and how you act. It is a journey through your defensesand beyond so that you can experience consciously the nature of yourpersonality, face what it has produced in your life, and choose to change that.1[part0021.html#footnote-6930-9]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [part0021.html#footnote-6930-9-backlink]. To learn how to apply what you havelearned in this chapter and deepen your experiences, see the Chapter 9 StudyGuide on page 288 [part0042.html#181NK0-ffe35c2ad53849cca826336987d3fbe4]."},{"pageContent":"Images [../images/00011.jpeg] 10 Images [../images/00011.jpeg]ADDICTIONYou cannot begin the work of releasing an addiction until you can acknowledgethat you are addicted. Until you realize that you have an addiction, it is notpossible to diminish its power. The personality rationalizes its addictions. Itdresses them in attractive clothing. It presents them to itself and others asdesirable or beneficial. A person who is addicted to alcohol, for example, willsay to herself or himself, or to others, that drunkenness is a way of looseningup, of relaxing after a tense day, of having fun, and, therefore, it isconstructive. A person who is addicted to sex will say to herself or himself, orto others, that random sexual encounters are expressions of closeness, or love,that they reflect an evolved and liberated perception, and, therefore, they aredesirable.Recognition of your own addictions requires inner work. It requires that youlook clearly at the places where you lose power in your life, where you arecontrolled by external circumstances. It requires going through your defenses.Even when striving for clarity, or when outer circumstances—such as an injurycaused by driving drunk, or a marriage wrecked by promiscuity—provide evidenceof an addiction, the personality often clings to a perception of its addictionas a mere problem, initially, as a small problem, then as a bigger problem, andthen as a significant problem.Why does the personality resist acknowledging its addictions?Acknowledging an addiction, accepting that you have an addiction, isacknowledgment that a part of you is out of control. The personality resistsacknowledging its addictions because that forces it to choose to leave a part ofitself out of control, or to do something about it. Once an addiction has beenacknowledged, it cannot be ignored, and it cannot be released without changingyour life, without changing your self-image, without changing your entireperceptual and conceptual framework. We do not want to do that because it is ournature to resist change. Therefore, we resist acknowledging our addictions.An addiction is not merely an attraction. It is natural for males and females toadmire each other, for example, and to feel a warmth and attraction toward eachother. An addiction is more than that. An addiction is characterized bymagnetism and fear. There is attraction plus fear, plus a jolt of energy that isout of proportion to the situation. Attractions are a pleasing part of life.They can be satisfied and left behind, but addictions cannot.An addiction cannot be satiated. A sexual addiction, for example, cannot besatisfied by sex. This is the first clue that the dynamic that is involved inwhat appears to be a sexual addiction is not sexual, but that the experiences ofaddictive sexual attraction, or repulsion, serve a deeper dynamic.An addiction can be anesthetized. A sexual addiction, for example, can be madedormant within a relationship by a fear of losing the security of therelationship, but it cannot be healed without a recognition that it is there,and an understanding of the dynamic that lies beneath it. Unless this takesplace, it will break through the relationship, or the facade of monogamy, atthose moments when the personality feels most insecure, or most threatened. Atthese times, the personality will feel a sexual attraction to others.Sexual addictions are the most universal within our species because the issuesof power are tied so directly to the learning of sexuality within the humanstructure. Sexuality and issues of power were created within our species tocomplement each other. That is why each human being who is sexually out ofcontrol actually has issues of power in which he or she is out of control withhis or her own power. At heart, they are identical. A person cannot be in his orher own power center and be sexually out of control or dominated by the sexualenergy current. These cannot exist simultaneously.What is the dynamic behind sexual addiction?The experience of addictive sexual attraction is a signal to the experiencerthat in that moment he or she is experiencing powerlessness, and is desiring tofeed upon a weaker soul. This is the dynamic beneath all addictions: the desireto prey upon a soul that is more shattered than oneself. This is as ugly to lookat as it is to experience, but it is the central core of negativity within ourspecies.Sex without reverence, like business without reverence, and politics withoutreverence, and any activity that is done without reverence, reflects the samething: one soul preying upon another weaker soul. The way out of a sexualaddiction, therefore, is to remind yourself when you feel that attraction, thatyou are, in that moment, powerless, and desiring to prey upon a soul that isweaker than yourself.In other words, when you are feeling the draw of a sexual addiction, considersimultaneously that you are in a mode of powerlessness that causes a desire touse others to surface within you. That desire feels like a sexual attraction.Remind yourself clearly of what it is that is being ignited in you. That doesnot mean that you do not physically feel a connection or an attraction, but,underneath it, what causes you to want to act is a different dynamic, one ofpowerlessness.Allow this consciousness to penetrate deeply within you so that, at that point,if you want to act on your addiction, you need to walk through your own reality.What does this mean?If you are married, or in a monogamous relationship, remind yourself that actingupon your impulse may, or will, cost you your marriage, or your relationship.Ask yourself if what you want to do is worth that. If you are healthy, remindyourself that acting upon your impulse may cost you your health, because you donot know whether or not the partner that you have chosen carries a disease, suchas AIDS. Ask yourself if what you want to do is worth that risk.Remind yourself that the partner to whom you are most likely drawn is drawnequally to others, as are you, that he or she has no more feeling for you thanyou have for him or her. You can be assured that this is the case because thesexual attraction that you have felt for this person is a response in you of aweakness detection system, so to speak, that you have used to scan those aroundyou. When it locates a person who is weak enough to be susceptible to you, to beseduced by you, it triggers within you the experience of sexual attraction. Willyou advance your masculinity, or your femininity, by exploiting the weakness ofthis person? Will that gain you what you want to gain?Remind yourself that you both have chosen to interact sexually in ways that donot ignite your feelings because, if your feelings were awakened, they wouldonly let you know that the person you are drawn to is no more emotionallyinvolved with you than you are with him or her. It is one thing to think thatyou are sexually involved with someone and not feeling anything. It is anotherto face that neither is your partner feeling anything for you.Look closely at the dynamic in which you are involved, and you will see thatwhen one soul seeks to prey upon a weaker soul, and a weaker soul responds, bothsouls are the weaker soul. Who preys upon whom? The logic of the five-sensorypersonality cannot grasp this, but the higher-order logic of the heart sees itclearly. Is there truly a difference when two consciousnesses are trying to linkinto a dynamic that ultimately will lead to balance when both have identicalmissing pieces? What causes the need to dominate, for example, is the same thatcauses the need to be submissive. It is merely the choice of which role the soulwishes to play in working out the identical struggle.Enter into your own fear, into your own sense of wanting a drink, or sex with adifferent partner. Ask yourself to seriously review all of the times in yourlife that you thought you would gain so much from that, and face what yougained.Hold on to the thought that you create your experiences. Your fear comes fromthe realization that a part of you is creating a reality that it wants, whetheryou want it or not, and the feeling that you are powerless to prevent it, butthat is not so. This is critical to understand: Your addiction is not strongerthan you. It is not stronger than who you want to be. Though it may feel thatway, it can only win if you let it. Like any weakness, it is not stronger thanthe soul or the force of will. Its strength only indicates the amount of effortthat needs to be applied toward the transition, toward making yourself whole inthat area of your life.Recognize that what you are doing when you fear that you will be tempted, andthat you will not be able to resist the temptation, is creating a situation thatwill give you permission to act irresponsibly. Is it possible to create a testthat you cannot pass? Yes. The experience of wanting to be tempted in order totest yourself is the act of creating an opportunity to act irresponsibly, to sayto yourself, “I knew I couldn’t do it, anyway,” and give in to your addiction.The heart of making a temptation that is greater than you can resist is that youdo not wish to be held responsible for your choice.The greater the desire of your soul to heal your addiction, the greater will bethe cost of keeping it. If you—if your soul—has chosen to heal an addiction now,you will find that the decision to maintain your addiction will cost you thethings that you hold most dear. If that is your wife or your husband, yourmarriage will be placed in the balance against your addiction. If that is yourcareer, your career will be placed in the balance.This is not the doing of a cruel Universe or a malicious God. It is acompassionate response to your desire to heal, to become whole. It is thecompassionate Universe saying to you that your inadequacies are so deep that theonly thing that will stop you will be something of equal or greater value inopposition to your inadequacies. This is the same dynamic that is expressed interms of space and time and matter by the second law of motion: “A change in themomentum (mass, direction of movement, and speed) of a body in motion isdirectly proportional to the force affecting the body in motion, and takes placein the direction that the force is acting.” By the magnitude of the costs ofyour addiction you can measure the importance of healing it to your soul, andthe strength of your own inner intention to do that.Try to realize, and truly realize, that what stands between you and a differentlife are matters of responsible choice. In your moments of fear, what you areobscure about in your thinking is the power and magnitude of your own choice.Recognize what your own power of choice is. You are not at the mercy of yourinadequacy. The intention that will empower you must come from a place withinyou that suggests that you are indeed able to make responsible choices and drawthe power from them, that you can make choices that empower you and notdisempower you, that you are capable of acts of wholeness. Test your power ofchoice because each time you choose otherwise you disengage the power of youraddiction more and more and increase your personal power more and more.As you work through your weaknesses, and you feel levels of addictiveattraction, ask yourself the critical questions of the spirit: If, by followingthose impulses, do you increase your level of enlightenment? Does it bring youpower of the genuine sort? Will it make you more loving? Will it make you morewhole? Ask yourself these questions.This is the way out of an addiction: Walk yourself through your reality step bystep. Make yourself aware of the consequences of your decisions, and chooseaccordingly. When you feel in yourself the addictive attraction of sex, oralcohol, or drugs, or anything else, remember these words: You stand between thetwo worlds of your lesser self and your full self. Your lesser self is temptingand powerful because it is not as responsible and not as loving and not asdisciplined, so it calls you. This other part of you is whole and moreresponsible and more caring and more empowered, but it demands of you the way ofthe enlightened spirit: conscious life. Conscious life. The other choice isunconscious permission to act without consciousness. It is tempting.What choose you?If your decision is to become whole, hold that decision. You will not be astempted or as frightened as you think. Hold it and remind yourself again andagain: You stand between your lesser self and your whole self. Choose withwisdom because the power is now fully in your hands. Do not underestimate thepower of consciousness. As you live and make conscious choices each moment andeach day you fill with strength and your lesser self disintegrates.As you choose to empower yourself, the part of you that you challenge, thetemptation that you challenge, will surface again and again. Each time that youchallenge it, you gain power and it loses power. If you challenge an addictionto alcohol, for example, and you are drawn twelve times that very day to have adrink, challenge that energy each time. If you look upon each recurrence ofattraction as a setback, or as an indication that your intention is not working,you choose the path of learning through fear and doubt. If you look upon eachrecurrence as an opportunity that is offered to you, in response to yourintention, to release your inadequacy and to acquire power over it, you choosethe path of learning through wisdom, for that is what it is.The first time that you challenge your addiction, and the second, and the third,you may not feel that anything has been accomplished. Do you think thatauthentic power can be had so easily? As you hold to your intention, and as youchoose again and again and again to become whole, you accumulate power, and theaddiction that you thought could not be challenged will lose its power over you.When you challenge an addiction, and choose to become whole, you align yourselfwith your nonphysical help. The work to be done is yours, but assistance isalways there for you. The nonphysical world, the actions of your guides andTeachers, touches yours in many ways—the thought that brings power, the memorythat reminds, the surprise occurrence that reinforces. There is much joy in thenonphysical world when a soul releases major negativity and the quality of itsconsciousness shifts upward into higher frequencies of Light. Therefore, do notsuffer in aloneness. There is no such thing.Look at yourself as someone who is reaching for healing, and at the complexityof what needs to be healed. Do not think that you exist alone without otherhuman beings of equal complexity. All that the human experience is about is thejourney toward wholeness. Therefore, you can look at each individual and restassured that they are not whole. They are in process. Were they whole, theywould not be physical upon our plane. In other words, you have the company ofbillions of souls.When you have worked hard, take the time to appreciate what you have done. Donot always look at the distance that you have yet to travel. Join yournonphysical Teachers and guides in applauding what you have accomplished. Thisdoes not mean to relapse into your addiction. It means allowing yourself to restwhen you need it, to recognize when you become exhausted, and to give yourselfthe grace of knowing that even the best of us get tired.Understanding the dynamics behind your addiction is one thing. Actually makingthe emotional connection to discharge the need for it is another story. Youraddiction is not insurmountable. It is not overwhelming. If it continues toappear that way to you, it is because deep in your heart you do not see yourselfas able to release the addiction, even if you understand why you are drawn toit. If your addiction lingers, ask yourself if you really want to release it,because in your heart you do not.Until you fill in the inadequacies within you, you will always have youraddiction. In order to release your addiction, it is necessary to enter yourinadequacies, to recognize that they are real, and to bring them into the lightof consciousness to heal. It is necessary to look deeply into the parts ofyourself that have such power to you, to look clearly at how deep they arewithin you, and to see them as honestly as you can. It may be that youraddiction has provided you one of the few genuine pleasures of your life. Whatis more important to you, your wholeness, and your freedom, or the pleasuresthat you get from satisfying your addiction?When you understand that your addiction results from an inadequacy, the questionbecomes how you will respond to your inadequacy—by reaching for another drink,or another sexual encounter, or by reaching inward for those things that fillthe whole? Move into how strong the power of your addiction is, into how deeplyyou feel its attraction, and ask yourself if the time is really right for you torelease this form of learning. That is for you to ask and answer. You may hearthe guidance of your nonphysical Teachers, and feel that it offers you a path ofhigher wisdom, but at the same moment realize that you are not ready to takethat path. You might decide that this is not the right time, that you are notyet strong enough to live a certain way. You might indeed have to face that.Ultimately, you will take the higher path, but if you wish to put the journeyoff for a day or a week or seven lifetimes, that is sufficient. Your Teacherssee from a perspective that does not include time. It is the depth of wisdom foryou to know that you will eventually take the path of consciousness. If that isthe path that you will eventually take, why wait? Yet, there are times whenthere is wisdom in waiting as the rest of you prepares for the journey. There isno shame in this decision.The Universe does not judge. Eventually, you will come to authentic empowerment.You will know the power of forgiveness, humbleness, clarity and love. You willevolve beyond the human experience, beyond the Earth school, beyond the learningenvironment of space and time and matter. You cannot not evolve. Everything inthe Universe evolves. It is only a question of which way you will choose tolearn as you evolve. This is always your choice, and there is always wisdom ineach choice.When you return home, when you leave your personality and body behind, you willleave behind your inadequacies, your fears and angers and jealousies. They donot, and cannot, exist within the realm of spirit. They are the experiences ofthe personality, of time and matter. You will once again enter the fullness ofwho you are. You will perceive with loving eyes and compassionate understandingthe experiences of your life, including those that seemed so much to controlyou. You will see what purposes they served. You will survey what has beenlearned, and you will bring these things into your next incarnation.If you choose to continue with your addiction, you choose to experience negativekarma. You choose to create without compassion. You choose to be unconscious.You choose to learn through the experiences that your unconscious intentionscreate. You choose to learn through fear and doubt, because you fear youraddiction and you doubt your power to challenge it successfully.If you choose to challenge your addiction, to move consciously toward wholeness,you choose to learn through wisdom. You choose to create your experiencesconsciously, to align the perceptions and the energy of your personality withyour soul. You choose to create within physical reality the reality that yoursoul wishes to create. You choose to allow your soul to move through you. Youchoose to allow Divinity to shape your world.When you struggle with an addiction, you deal directly with the healing of yoursoul. You deal directly with the matter of your life. This is the work that isrequired to be done. As you face your deepest struggles, you reach for yourhighest goal. As you bring to light, heal, and release the deepest currents ofnegativity within you, you allow the energy of your soul to move directly into,and to shape, the experiences and events of physical reality, and thereby toaccomplish unimpeded its tasks upon the Earth.This is the work of evolution. It is the work that you were born to do.1[part0022.html#footnote-6930-10]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [part0022.html#footnote-6930-10-backlink]. To learn how to apply what you havelearned in this chapter and deepen your experiences, see the Chapter 10 StudyGuide on page 294 [part0043.html#190860-ffe35c2ad53849cca826336987d3fbe4]."},{"pageContent":"Images [../images/00011.jpeg] 11 Images [../images/00011.jpeg]RELATIONSHIPSThere are certain growing dynamics that can occur only within the dynamic ofcommitment. Without commitment you cannot learn to care for another person morethan yourself. You cannot learn to value the growth of strength and clarity inanother soul, even if that threatens the wants of your personality. When yourelease the wants of your personality in order to accommodate and encourageanother’s growth, you attune yourself to that person’s soul. Without commitment,you cannot learn to see others as your soul sees them; as beautiful and powerfulspirits of Light.The archetype of spiritual partnership—partnership between equals for thepurpose of spiritual growth—is emerging within our species. This is differentfrom the archetype of marriage, which was designed to assist physical survival,and in which the partners do not necessarily see themselves as equals. Whenindividuals enter into a marriage, the ability of each to survive physically isenhanced. They are more capable together of finding fire, shelter, food andwater, and of defending themselves, than they are individually. The marriagearchetype reflects the perception of power as external.The archetype of spiritual partnership reflects the conscious journey ofmultisensory humans toward authentic power. Spiritual partners recognize theexistence of the soul, and consciously seek to further its evolution. Theyrecognize nonphysical dynamics at work within the world of time and matter. Theysee matter as the densest, or heaviest, level of Light that is continually beingshaped and reshaped by the souls that share this sphere of learning. Theyconsciously cocreate their experiences with each other, with an alive Earth thatloves Life very much, and with a compassionate Universe.Communities, nations, and cultures—all of our collective creations—are builtupon the values and perceptions of the five-sensory personality, the values thatare reflected by the archetype of marriage. They are designed to serve thephysical survival of our species. They also reflect the decisions of our speciesto learn through fear and doubt.Our entire world is built upon the energy of the five-sensory personality thathas chosen to learn through fear and doubt. Nations fear nations, races fearraces, and the sexes fear each other. The exploration of physical reality, whichis external power, could have been accomplished in a spirit of cooperation with,and appreciation of, the Earth. Instead, we chose as a species to explore itwith a sense of domination and exploitation. This is the path of learningthrough fear and doubt, fear of the physical environment and doubt that we fitnaturally into it.Our world reflects the basic thought form that there is no afterlife, that inthis lifetime the only thing that insures power is what can be had and gained.Sometimes we speak of an afterlife, but we do not really believe that after weleave the Earth we are still responsible for the choices that we have made uponthe Earth or our choices would be very different.Our species is no longer humble. It has no reverence. It is arrogant and filledwith its own technology. It seduces itself constantly in terms of its illusionsthat it is in control, and so it creates chaos and still refuses to see that itis impossible for it to control. We take from the Earth and from each other. Wedestroy forests and oceans and atmosphere. We enslave each other, and tortureand beat and humiliate and murder each other.When the archetype of spiritual partnership—of individuals joined in equalityfor the purpose of spiritual growth—emerges at the level of community, itcreates values and perceptions at that level that reflect those of themultisensory personality. Just as individuals that bond in spiritual partnershipand choose to express their bond through the convention of marriage infuse theenergy of spiritual partnership into the archetype of marriage, and therebycreate new values and behaviors within marriage, individuals that join inspiritual partnership at the level of organization, city, nation, race, and sexinfuse the collective consciousnesses of these levels with the energy ofspiritual partnership, and create new values and behaviors at these levels.The evolutionary process that occurs at the level of the individual is the sameprocess that occurs at each level of interaction between individuals. When anindividual invokes the energy of the archetype of spiritual partnership, notonly the partnership that it forms with another individual is affected, but alsoits community, nation, and the global village. Your decision to evolveconsciously through responsible choice contributes not only to your ownevolution, but also to the evolution of all of those aspects of humanity inwhich you participate. It is not just you that is evolving through yourdecisions, but the entirety of humanity.If you wish the world to become loving and compassionate, become loving andcompassionate yourself. If you wish to diminish fear in the world, diminish yourown. These are the gifts that you can give. The fear that exists between nationsis a macrocosm of the fear that exists between individuals. The perception ofpower as external that separates nations is the same that exists betweenindividuals; and the love, clarity, and compassion that emerge within theindividual that chooses consciously to align itself with its soul is the samethat will bring sexes, races, nations, and neighbors into harmony with eachother. There is no other way. Though each human being is responsible for thequality of Life that he or she personally experiences, simultaneously thatextends into the macrocosm.The threat of nuclear annihilation, for example, is a macrocosmic idea or notionon our Earth, and it requires the complete evolution of the microcosm in orderfor that to evaporate. So long as those who strive to establish harmony at thelevel of nations have within themselves the anger and violence that they seek toheal between nations, the harmony that they seek to create at the macrocosmiclevel cannot come into being. What is in one is in the whole, and therefore,ultimately, each soul is responsible for the whole world.When you commit to a spiritual partnership with another human being, you bringthe energy of the archetype of spiritual partnership into the physical arena.You begin to form and to live by the values, perceptions, and actions thatreflect equality with your partner and a commitment to his or her spiritualdevelopment and your own. You begin to set aside the wants of your personalityin order to accommodate the needs of your partner’s spiritual growth, and, indoing that, you grow yourself. That is how spiritual partnership works.You begin to see that what is necessary to the health of your partnership isidentical with what is necessary to your own spiritual growth, that each of youholds the pieces that the other is missing. If you are jealous, for example, youwill find that jealousy is what brings to the surface in your partner an aspectthat needs to be healed, and that that aspect is mirrored in yourself. You beginto value your partner’s contribution to your development. You experience thathis or her perceptions and observations are helpful, and, indeed, central, toyour growth, that conversations between you stir deep waters.You learn the roles of love and commitment and trust in making your partnershipwork. You learn that love alone is not enough, that without trust, you are notable to give and to receive the love that both of you have for each other. Youlearn that your commitment must be translated into a form that satisfies theneeds of both you and your partner. You learn to value the needs of your partneras much as you value your own, because the partnership that you both wantrequires two healthy and inwardly secure individuals.You learn to trust not only each other, but also your ability to grow together.You learn that you put your partnership most at risk by avoiding that which youare most afraid will destroy it. It is not easy to express what is inside you,especially that which makes you feel vulnerable or painful or angry or upset.These are the emotions that empower words that can do either damage or can do somuch healing. You learn that sharing your concerns with consideration and theintention to heal and trust in the process is the only appropriate avenue. Asyou approach your needs with courage instead of fear you ignite a sense oftrust. The true human condition in its most perfect form has no secrets. It doesnot hide, but exists in clear love.You learn not to do stupid and careless things to each other. You learn thatwanting what you want is not enough, but that you must both want it deeply andcreate it every day, that you must bring it into being and hold it in being withyour intentions. As the consciousness of each of you becomes lighter, yourpartnership becomes richer.You learn the value of considering the other’s position. By becoming the otherperson, by truly walking into the fears of the other and then returning intoyour own being again, you open up the conversation to transcend the personal andbecome healing at the impersonal. This allows you to see each other as spiritualplaymates as you work through the areas that require healing in each of you.Even into the toughest moments of your work on feelings of insecurity you can belight and remind yourself that you are spirits who have taken on the physicalexperience and have far greater power than you are showing in that moment ofweakness.The things that are the individual’s to learn in spiritual union with anotherindividual are the group’s, the community’s, and the nation’s to learn inspiritual union with other groups, communities, and nations. The choice in eachinstance is between learning through fear and doubt or through wisdom, betweenthe lower-frequency energy currents of the personality and the higher-frequencyenergy currents of the soul. If the anger of one personality toward anothercreates distance, shatters intimacy, and causes defensiveness, the anger of onenation, or religion, or sex toward another produces the same. If the concern ofone personality for another produces closeness, appreciation, and mutual regard,the concern of one nation, or religion, or community for another produces thesame. The dynamic is identical.You are related to every form of Life upon this planet and beyond. As your soulevolves, you move into greater awareness of the nature of that relationship, andthe responsibilities that you assume.Within our species there are degrees of soul consciousness. The significance ofthe evolution of responsibility is that each human being moves through levels ofresponsibility on its way to wholeness. In other words, as a soul chooses thelesson of responsibility, it will find itself incarnating into an atmosphere ofmore potential impact upon the species. The personality must also come to agreewith what the soul has chosen. If you are not consciously ready, you will not beput into a position to impact many for the protection of your own soul.A soul that is new to the human experience, for example, a soul that has evolvedfrom the animal kingdom and is beginning its journey of human evolution,although there are very few of them at this point, begins within a certainfrequency range, and for its own protection incarnates into a limited sphere ofhuman life. It may incarnate into a remote region so that it can have a gentlelife familiarizing itself with the human physical experience. As it becomes moreadept at the human sensory system, at human intelligence, at the connectionbetween the soul and body energy and what is expected within a humanincarnation, its capacity to move and incarnate into more responsible centers ofactivity increases. Center of activity does not mean the presence of a city or auniversity, but an activity of karmic proportion.In other words, a person that is living in a remote area in which thetemptations of life and the definitions of good and evil are far more clear, andin which there are not as many temptations, is not in the same karmic center asa soul that has chosen to incarnate as one who would have a larger sphere ofinfluence within a family, or a community, or a nation. A soul’s center ofactivity refers to the degree of expansion of its karmic influence and energyinfluence. A soul needs to be more advanced to handle the possibilities thatcome from the expansion of its karmic energy influences. This is thesignificance of the evolution of responsibility.As souls choose to participate consciously in more inclusive levels ofinteraction, they take on not only their own transformation, but also those ofthe larger collectives in which they participate. Think of your consciousness interms of physical light. That light shines, but a brighter light shines over awider range, and a dimmer light shines on a smaller range. The extent to whichyour light shines is the width and depth and breadth of your karmic influence.If you are a major light you shine upon the entire globe. If you are growinginto a major light but are a lesser light you shine within a different range ofwhich you are held karmically responsible, but your potential to shift your ownquality of consciousness and the quality of consciousness of others is equallyenormous.Within the sphere of possibilities and probabilities for the soul there existmany opportunities, including the possibility that the soul might choose, forexample, its most remote path of growth instead of the one that is most naturalto its energy, so to speak. If, in the privacy of his or her own spiritualchoices, as he or she advances in faith and in courage and in feelings for hisor her own humanity, a soul may well open that door which leads to greaterawareness and to greater karmic influence and responsibility. Whereas thatpossibility might have existed with only a small probability at the time of thesoul’s incarnation, a door that would open only under certain circumstances—ifthis happened and then if that happened—it may become so that the soul doesindeed find its way to that path.Every microconsciousness, or individual soul, affects the macroconsciousnessdepending upon its quality of Light, upon the frequency of its consciousness. Asoul that agrees to incarnate into a lifetime in which it has significantpotential to affect the lives of many is a great soul. The quality of power ofsuch a soul is great. It is global. Its capacity to touch the lives of millions,and, indeed, billions of human beings is very real, and so will be its karmicdebt if it fails in its task to advance humanity. It will have the karmicresponsibility of billions of souls upon its own.Great souls upon our planet, like all souls upon our planet, must make decisionsmoment by moment. As you look upon the many souls of our Earth who stand inmajor positions to maneuver the lives of thousands, or millions, or billions ofhuman beings, allow yourself to distinguish them from their personalities. Eventhough a soul has the ability to influence the lives of billions of people, oreven the entirety of humanity, its personality is tempted.When the personality, Jesus, encountered the Luciferic principle, thechallenging principle of our species, when he was offered dominion over theentire globe, the fulfillment of all that he could conceive, was he tempted?Yes, he was tempted. If he were not, there would have been no power in hischoice. Were the choice of the path of glory that he chose not balanced againstanother of equal attraction, how could he have drawn such power from thatchoice? Authentic empowerment is not gained by making choices that do notstretch you.When a soul chooses the vertical path, when it chooses to evolve consciouslythrough responsible choice, it becomes capable of liberating itself from its ownnegativities. It reaches for authentic power. It takes on, so to speak, its ownnegativity, the unconscious intentions of the splintered parts of itspersonality. As a personality becomes conscious, as it evolves into amultisensory personality and becomes integrated, the frequency of itsconsciousness increases. It becomes whole. Its negativities drop away and thequality of its consciousness becomes lighter. It becomes able to see itself andthose around it with compassion and clarity, with the wisdom of its soul.When a soul chooses to participate consciously in more inclusive levels ofinteraction, it becomes capable of participating directly in the liberation ofits family, or its group, or its community, or its nation from the negativitiesthat are present and active at those levels. It also runs the risk ofcontamination by those negativities. In other words, a soul that seeks to bringa higher quality of consciousness to a more inclusive level of human interactionruns the risk of being contaminated by the fear, or the anger, or theselfishness of that level.Great souls, such as the soul that was Gandhi, for example, run the risk ofgreat contamination. At the level of soul contact, a great soul deals not onlywith its own fear, its personal fear, but it also takes on the evolution of thecollective fear of the species. The weight of that is where a great soul riskscontamination on a great level, but its possibility of releasing the fear fromthe collective consciousness of the species becomes also possible.The consciousness of a great soul is symbolic of the larger consciousness, themacroconsciousness, that holds the same values and fears and guilts. Thatmacroconsciousness might be the collective consciousness of the United States,or Russia, or Ethiopia. The many souls that form that collective are incontinual dialogue with its own. The great soul is the person who has taken onthe task of change. If he or she is able to transcend fear, to act out ofcourage, the whole of its group will benefit and each one, in his or her ownlife, will be suddenly more courageous, though they may not see how or why.Not all souls accomplish the tasks that they have set for themselves. As youlook at the individuals who are in major positions of influence upon our planetyou can see whether or not they are succeeding in their tasks of advancinghumanity by the choices that they have made. Some have chosen to alignthemselves, like mannequins, with the dying consciousness of the five-sensoryhuman that has existed within the collective consciousness of each of ournations. They have chosen, in other words, to represent a system that isdisintegrating, and so their own systems are disintegrating before their eyes.Their comrades are corrupt. Their governments are corrupt.These souls represent a form of power that is no longer effective, but they havefailed to understand that. They draw to themselves those whose consciousnessesare aligned symbolically and in terms of beliefs to their own. They choose towalk the shifting pattern of fear and selfishness. They exhibit great paranoiacenergy, and, therefore, they attract to themselves, their governments, and theirmilitaries fellow human beings that have the same paranoiac desire to destroylife, as if the destruction of life will save our planet, but it will not.Through the decisions that they have made, these souls have refused toacknowledge that the older forms of power, the perception of power as external,no longer will be tolerated upon the Earth. Nonetheless, the evolution fromexternal power to authentic power is occurring now in full force, and so theirdecisions affect only how that shift will take place. They have chosen the pathof fear and doubt, of trauma and pain.The difference between a great soul that aligns itself with openness and growthand interdependence, that transcends its fear on behalf of itself and itscollective, and one that does not is that the soul that chooses openness has adifferent active level of courage and insight and wisdom, and the one that doesnot has consistently weakened under the impact of the fear of the collective.Choice to choice to choice to choice, negativity upon negativity, and a Hitleris created. The soul that was Hitler had great potential as well.Every soul that agrees consciously to bring to a level of human interaction thelove and compassion and wisdom that it has acquired is trying through his or herown energy to challenge the fear patterns of that collective. This is thearchetypical pattern that was put into place within our species by the Teacher,Jesus. It is what He symbolized as He moved through His lifetime in the way thatHe did. He released the negative karmic patterns of the collective unconsciousthat had accumulated to His time. In each great soul it is the same pattern—thepattern of taking on the whole through the power of his or her own consciousnessto transform it.When a soul reaches for authentic power and chooses consciously to bring thatpower into the levels of interaction that it shares with other souls, it entersthis dynamic. It brings to a collective energy system the consciousness ofauthentic power, and through that power engages in the transformation of thatcollective.Your evolution toward authentic power, therefore, affects not only you. As thefrequency of your consciousness increases, as the quality of your consciousnessreflects the clarity, humbleness, forgiveness, and love of authentic power, ittouches more and more around you. As your temptations become greater, so doesyour ability to make responsible choices. As you shine brighter, as your Lightand power increase with each responsible choice, so does your world.1[part0023.html#footnote-6930-11]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [part0023.html#footnote-6930-11-backlink]. To learn how to apply what you havelearned in this chapter and deepen your experiences, see the Chapter 11 StudyGuide on page 300 [part0044.html#19UOO0-ffe35c2ad53849cca826336987d3fbe4]."},{"pageContent":"Images [../images/00011.jpeg] 12 Images [../images/00011.jpeg]SOULSEach human being has a soul. The journey toward individual soulhood is whatdistinguishes the human kingdom from the animal kingdom, the vegetable kingdom,and the mineral kingdom. Only the human kingdom has the experience of individualsoulhood. That is why its powers of creation are great.The soul process moves through degrees of awareness. Animals, for example, donot have individual souls. They have group souls. Each animal is a part of agroup soul. Each horse is a part of the group soul of horse, each cat is a partof the group soul of cat, and so on. A group soul is not the same as anindividual soul.Consider, for example, the group soul of buffalo. There is one group soul ofenormous impersonal energy that is called “buffalo.” It is an enormous expansivesphere of impersonal energy that is buffalo consciousness. It exists at a levelof simply energy dynamics, not individual selfhood. That energy is in continualmovement. As it heightens in frequency, it can spill over into the next level,and it also can absorb other frequencies from a lower level, so the soulcontinues. It is a group soul, not individual. There are not individual buffalosouls within a whole. There is only one soul energy system wherein there is noindividualhood. Instinctual behavior is the way of the group soul.Picture a movement that looks like the mouth of the Mississippi River. As youwalk up the river from that place, the river grows more and more and more narrowuntil it reaches but a point of power. The open mouth area is analogous to agroup soul. The size of it, the collective nature of it, is the group soul. Thisis the nature of the souls in the mineral, vegetable, and animal kingdoms. Inother words, “cat” is a cat soul, “dolphin” is a dolphin soul, and so on.Within the animal kingdom, there are graduations of intelligence and awareness.For example, dolphin, horse, and dog are not on the same wavelength. Theconsciousness of the dolphin is closer to the consciousness of the ape, and thencloser to the consciousness of the dog, but the consciousness of the horse is ona level beneath them. It is possible that the human soul can be produced throughthe evolution of the animal kingdom as a collective energy from the animal soul.How does this happen?The dolphin soul, for example, evolves through each particular individualdolphin. The particular advancements of each particular dolphin advance the soulof the dolphin itself. The collective is enhanced by the accomplishments of theindividual dolphin. The same mechanism works within the human kingdom. With eachof our individual advancements, the group soul of humanity—what we call ourcollective unconscious—evolves. In this way, evolution continues within thedolphin species, as within all species.Let us say, arbitrarily, that the consciousness of the dog soul is twentypercentile points below that of the dolphin soul, twenty points less than theintelligence of the dolphin. If the group soul of dog produces high Lightconsciousness, it is possible for that consciousness to release itself from thegroup soul of dog and advance into and penetrate the consciousness of dolphin.Likewise, it is possible, and it does happen, that human beings’ souls come fromthe advanced soul energy of the dolphin soul or the ape soul, and begin theirprocess of evolution into the human soul.Unlike an animal, you have an individual soul. You are an individual energysystem, a micro of a macro. As part of the micro, you have all the power of themacro calibrated to an individual form of certain energies. Animals are notmicros of a macro. Cats, for example, do not have individual souls or egoenergy. They are merely physical manifestations of a huge macro system. Thatcertain cats are scared and certain are comforted is merely the differentnumerous millions of frequencies that interact into the group cat soul.Animals do not evolve through responsible choice as we do. Rather, the frequencyof their consciousnesses becomes Lightened in the fullness of the evolution oftheir soul as a group. This does not mean that animals are not capable ofindividual acts of love. What of an animal that lays down its life for itshuman? That is as legitimate a sacrifice of love of life as it is for a human,because in that instance the animal realizes that it is willingly releasing itslife. That, for an animal, is graduation to the human experience, or to its nexthigher level.The nature of a group soul can be seen through its manifestations. The nature ofdolphin soul, for example, is expressed through dolphins. The same is true forour species. The nature of the soul of humankind can be seen through the natureof human beings.The dolphin soul is leaving the Earth, that is, the dolphin species is becomingextinct. The dolphins are beaching themselves. They are creating diseases withinthemselves. This is their way of refusing to continue to live upon the Earth.They feel that they cannot fulfill the purpose for which they are born.Therefore, they are leaving. Their deaths are not suicides because they are notfrightened. They are exhausted.The dolphin soul manifests itself—dolphins are born—to bring love and life andcreativity to the oceans. They manifest to form a bridge of joy and love andintelligence between the aquatic kingdom and the human kingdom. This they cannotdo. Our species reaches toward the dolphin soul only with brutality.The dolphin spirit—how it suffers! This is a time of great sorrow. It is a timeto look soberly and deeply upon the values and behaviors that result from theperception of power as external. It is a time to grieve with the dolphin soul,to offer comfort to it.If you wish to offer comfort to the dolphin soul, image from the heart of thedolphin consciousness that your energies are moving below deep warm clearsoothing water. As you feel yourself emerging into the aquatic kingdom, letyourself begin to radiate your thoughts to these fellow creatures that share ourplanetary home. Image that you are sending them love as they continue theirevolution and leave the Earth school, that you grieve with them and yet you knowthat, like you, they are immortal. Send these thoughts. Let them know they arenot leaving without human beings’ understanding. Let them hear you say, “I amone who understands.”Can you do that?It will make their grieving journey of value.There is more than one avenue from which individual souls are formed. Part ofthe chain of evolution within our global village is the process of thisadvancement from kingdom to kingdom to kingdom, but if a soul that has not beenbefore upon our planet chooses the human experience, it would not be necessaryfor that soul to move through kingdom evolution. It would, indeed, pick up thesituation within the physical environment that is most appropriate for it.There are souls that have never had the human experience. When we speak of soulsentering the physical arena to heal, to balance their energy, to pay theirkarmic debts, we are speaking of the evolution of Life as we know it upon ourEarth. We are not speaking of other galaxies, or of Life on other levels thatare not physical as we know them. The experience of physicalness is not alwaysnecessary to certain advances. If it is, it is encouraged.There comes a point when the physicalness experience no longer serves the soul’sawareness, and, therefore, the soul chooses to learn in the nonphysical realm.It may choose to learn, for example, through the task of becoming a nonphysicalguide. Each individual human soul is a micro of the macro that is the soul ofthe human species, but the soul of humankind is not a micro of a macro. In otherwords, there is no larger spiritual human soul beyond the soul of humanity.Beyond that comes the experience of master, the experience of moving intoadvanced levels of Light that is no longer specific to human.Our nonphysical Teachers are from these levels of Light. Therefore, it is notappropriate to consider them from the dynamic of the personal. Rather, it ismore appropriate to think of them as impersonal consciousnesses, which is thatwhich they are, from realms that cannot be understood in human terms. They donot, for example, have the splintered personality aspects that we have. They donot have shadow sides, so to speak. Does an Angel have a soul? An Angel is itssoul, its full soul.That is the difference between that which is whole and in union and that whichis growing into it. Duality only exists in certain levels, and not in others.Duality is a dynamic of learning. It is its own rhythm and tension and does notexist beyond another level of learning and development. You are existing induality, and your nonphysical Teachers are not.This is not their home, so to speak. They are teachers to our plane. They arefree to teach in our plane without being of our plane. Your nonphysical Teacherdoes not become of this plane when it counsels you any more than a parentbecomes an infant in order to teach its infant. It is not necessary. That levelof evolution is assumed in the presence of the parent. It is simply the naturaldynamic of evolution.We are destined to evolve beyond the nature of duality. Duality is that which isunderstood in time and space. As you evolve beyond that, and also when you leaveyour physical body and journey home to your nonphysical plane of reality, youwill not exist in dualism, and that sense of the wrathful, or sorrowful, orfearful self that you think of as present to you now will evaporate. It has nopower in the realm beyond duality where there exists the perfection of all thatis. When you leave your physical form, you will join the nonphysical level ofreality that is appropriate to your vibrational frequency at the time that youleave your incarnation.Where do advanced human souls go?There are many forms of Life that exist as advancements of this one. There areliterally millions of options. There is life in numerous galaxies. There aremillions, indeed, billions of other life-filled planets. There is not one planetthat lacks a level of active consciousness, some of which is akin to our humanform, and some of which does not come close to our form, but remainsconsciousness as we understand the term.There exists a realm that the religious language of the West would call theAngelic kingdom. This is a range of beings of numerous frequencies and qualitiesof consciousness, many of whom guide and interact with us upon the Earth. Thisrealm is indeed balanced with other forces, but it cannot be understood in humanterms. Evolution continues in that realm, although there is that perception thatour words “harmony” and “perfectness” would address. An Angel might be thoughtof as a force of consciousness that has evolved into an appropriate teachingmodality for the planetary village called Earth, but may also have been a partof the evolution of other galaxies and Life forms there.An Angel’s home, so to speak, is that kingdom, the Angelic kingdom, and therange of nonphysical Life forms that exist within and lower than and beyond thatvibrational sphere. Angels continue evolution, as do other members of thatrealm, as do those consciousnesses that we would recognize as masters, such asthose after whom religions have been named upon our Earth. That evolutioncontinues, but there is perfectness rather than the experience of fusingconsciousness with matter that occurs within our Earth school.Does the law of karma apply to nonphysical beings?The law of karma is universal in the sense that there is not a Life form that isnot responsible for its energy, but karma cannot be understood in terms ofnonphysical dimensions in the same way that we understand it. An Angel does nothave the barriers that we have. An Angel sees something, for example, and we donot. The difference is a barrier. An Angel does not have our barriers, and so itcannot create the karma that we do. It has a level of sight and knowledge thatprevents certain actions from happening simply because of the depth ofknowingness that is of its rank in creation.The great law of karma works because an Angel still has will, but an Angel isarmed with a great deal more than the limitation that characterizes the humanexperience. An Angel does not fear death. It has no physicalness. It is onlythat it is immortal. It is with all that is. It has no doubt. It sees and livesin Light, so the ingredients that create karma for the human experience are notpart of its personal reality. Although an Angel has will, the circumstancescannot be described in which that will might bend in the wrong way, if therewere such a thing, or in a negative way. In one sense, an Angel can beconsidered to have evolved beyond the need to be tested, and, therefore, for it,there is no karma.Other levels also exist, such as the level in which disincarnate spirits arebound close to their physicalness in the immediate environment of the Eartharena. These spirits do not pursue the journey back to their higher selves, butremain bound with their nonphysical individual states close to the Earth.Imagine that your personality, your characteristics, and part of yournonphysical self wish to remain intact and not proceed on their evolution. Theprocess of the soul discharging the aspects of personality does not happen. Acombustion and congestion occurs within the energy system. Usually this happenswhen a soul cannot accept that it must move on and release a particularincarnation. In some instances, a soul holds on to a personality because thatpersonality was particularly successful or powerful in its lifetime.The congestion in the process of evolution that occurs produces the phenomenathat we refer to as evil spirits, ghosts, or possessions. These spirits chooseto remain Earthbound, within the Earth’s auric field. Are they evil? They arenegative, yes, but evil is another issue. Do they encourage negativity? Yes, butthat is part of the law of attraction; their own energy is drawn to like forcesof energy, or like forces of weakness. Within this realm, these spirits cancreate additional negative karma by pursuing malevolence.Therefore, it is possible to speak of evolving beyond karma, as the Buddhas do.They are referring to the karma of the Earth, where there is always thiscircumstance of choice between how you want to learn, which path shall youchoose. The Buddhas refer to the Earth, to the human experience and how it isset up, which is with free will, choice, placed between faith and doubt, goodand evil, between the choices and dualisms that our species has created. It isthat karma that they are referring to, not the karmic patterns that cease to beonce you, as a soul, no longer require learning in the world of duality. Eventhough Angels have will they do not accumulate karma as we think of it. It isnot part of their dimension. Yet they have will. The law of karma as weunderstand it is the law of karma for physical matter and spirit, not forspirit.Many realms that are nonphysical are not Angelic. In addition to the realm ofdisincarnate human beings that are bound close to the Earth, for example, thereis the Devic community of our Nature kingdoms. There are numerous, numerousrealms of nonphysical life. Beyond the Angelic realm are realms upon realms ofintelligence that we would think of as God.Within the human species there exist degrees of soul consciousness. Not allhumans are equally aware of their souls. Therefore, do all human beings haveequal potential?Yes and no. This question is complex. It cannot be answered simply because amongsouls that are on the same frequency band, such as those within the Earthschool, there is a common quality of consciousness, yet there is a differencebetween their ranges of consciousness. An individual that is not quite asexpanded in his or her awareness is not equal in the sense that we usually meanequal to someone of greater awareness. There is an inequality. Yet it is not aninequality that remains unequal. It is just a temporary level of momentum in theflow of evolution.A soul has no beginning and no end, and yet some souls are older than othersouls. Both are true. All souls come directly from the Godhead, and yet there isno single way that souls are formed individually. Both are true. Understandingthe soul becomes paradoxical only if you apply a type of thinking that holds thenotion of beginning.All that is can form itself into individual droplets of consciousness. Becauseyou are part of All that is, you have literally always been, yet there was theinstant when that individual energy current that is you was formed. Considerthat the ocean is God. It has always been. Now reach in and grab a cup full ofwater. In that instant, the cup becomes individual, but it has always been, hasit not? This is the case with your soul. There was the instant when you became acup of energy, but it was of an immortal original Being.You have always been because what it is that you are is God, or DivineIntelligence, but God takes on individual forms, droplets, reducing its power tosmall particles of individual consciousness. It is a massive reduction of power,yet the power is as full in that droplet as it is in the whole. It is asimmortal and as creative and as expressive but in its tinier form its energy isreduced appropriately to its form. As that little form grows in power, inselfhood, in its own consciousness of self, it becomes larger and more Godlike.Then it becomes God.This is a process that parallels the process of your personality, which is ofyour soul, expanding into your higher self, and thereby coming into the fullpower of your soul incarnate. It also parallels the process of your personalityand higher self reentering the fullness of your soul when you leave the Earth.As an individual soul, you remain an individual soul. You are both individualand one with All that is.The individual unit of evolution is the soul. This perception is new to usbecause, as a species, we have not before been aware of the existence of thesoul. In our religious thoughts we acknowledge what we call the soul, but wehave not, until now, taken it seriously enough to consider what the existence ofthe soul means in terms of everyday experience, in terms of the joys and painsand sorrows and fulfillments that make a human life.We have not turned our attention to the needs of the soul. We have notconsidered what is required by the soul in order to be healthy. We have notstudied the soul, or sought to help it attain what is necessary to its evolutionand its health. Because we have been five-sensory, we have focused upon the bodyand the personality. We have developed an extensive knowledge of the physicalapparatus that the soul assumes when it incarnates. We know of amino acids,neurotransmitters, chromosomes, and enzymes, but we do not know of the soul. Wedo not know how these physical functions serve the soul, or are affected by it.We seek to cure dysfunctions of the body by controlling its environment at themolecular level. In other words, our approach to healing is based upon theperception of power as external. This type of healing can be helpful to thebody, but it does not, and cannot, heal at the level of the soul.Consider that those who are trained in this way are accustomed to learning aboutLife through the study of dead matter. They seek to learn of Life through thestudy of carcasses and corpses. Through the study of that which does not havespirit, how can they see spirit? Even as such minds look out into this vastgalaxy, they cannot see Life because they are convinced that the entire galaxydoes not have Life, except as they see it and identify it, so the Life forms andthe brothers and sisters that we have on other galaxies remain hidden, and willremain hidden until the basic premise that Life is and permeates all that is,that there is only Life, becomes the principle of what we call science. Then wewill explore the physics of the soul. Then we will study Life with Life and notdead matter and not try to breathe intelligence and purpose into it by takingapart in our laboratories human forms and animal forms. This will be seensomeday as a very primitive form of learning because there is no consciousnessthere.The body is the instrument of the soul. If the piano player is sick, does ithelp to repair his or her piano? What an instrument produces depends not onlyupon the state of the instrument, but also upon the musician. If the musicianplays the blues, or soars with joy, the instrument follows. Even a tuned andpolished instrument cannot soar with joy if the musician chooses sadness orgrief. In the case of your soul and body, the instrument becomes the blues, orsoars with joy. If the musician becomes consumed with grief, or anger, orsadness, the instrument disintegrates. In some cases, a broken instrument can berepaired, but a repair at that level cannot cure what caused the breakdown.After several years of marriage to a willful partner, an acquaintance of minefound herself suffocating in the relationship, unable to express her deepestdesires and her creativity. One winter morning her husband’s Jeep, which wasparked on their steep driveway, broke loose and rolled over her, crushing herpelvic area. Surgery and chemicals healed her hips and eased the pain of herbody, but can surgery mend the damage that is done when a woman’screativity—represented, in this case, by her pelvic area, her reproductivecapability, the physical symbol of her feminine creativity—is crushed by theuncontrolled macho masculinity of her husband—represented, in this case, by arunaway Jeep? Can chemicals ease the pain of a suffering soul?Is it chance that one person develops heart disease, while another developscancer? Even though disease states have correlations to factors of diet,exercise, lifestyle, and heredity, these correlations cannot mask the fact thatlife, for some people, is a heartbreak, while others allow themselves to beconsumed, to be eaten alive, by the negative experiences of their lives. Canbypass surgery or chemotherapy heal that?Are the numerous ways that physical dysfunctions occur without meaning? Healthfor some people is a matter of the heart, for others a matter of what they candigest or eliminate in the course of their lives, for others a matter of thehead, and for others a matter of being able to hear, or to see, or to movethrough their lives flexibly, or to stand on their own, or literally to handlethe experiences of their lives. These are the issues that must be addresseddirectly and openly and honestly in the creation of health.This does not mean that it is inappropriate to care for the body, or to see aphysician in times of illness. Even though the physical is not as real, so tospeak, as the nonphysical, it is, nonetheless, the lowest, densest projection ofspiritual matter, and, therefore, it must be honored. It must be honored. Thebody needs rest, and it needs care, but behind every aspect of the health orillness of the body is the energy of the soul.It is the health of the soul that is the true purpose of the human experience.Everything serves that.1 [part0024.html#footnote-6930-12]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [part0024.html#footnote-6930-12-backlink]. To learn how to apply what you havelearned in this chapter and deepen your experiences, see the Chapter 12 StudyGuide on page 306 [part0045.html#1AT9A0-ffe35c2ad53849cca826336987d3fbe4]."},{"pageContent":"Images [../images/00014.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":"Images [../images/00011.jpeg] 13 Images [../images/00011.jpeg]PSYCHOLOGYPsychology means soul knowledge. It means the study of the spirit, but it hasnever been that. Psychology is the study of cognitions, perceptions, andaffects. It is the study of the personality.Because psychology is based upon the perceptions of the five-sensorypersonality, it is not able to recognize the soul. It is not able to understandthe dynamics that underlie the values and behaviors of the personality. Just asmedicine seeks to heal the body without recognizing the energy of the soul thatlies behind the health or illness of the body, and, therefore, cannot heal thesoul, psychology seeks to heal the personality without recognizing the force ofthe soul that lies behind the configuration and experiences of the personality,and, therefore, also cannot heal at the level of the soul.In order to develop and nurture your mind and your body, it is necessary torealize that you have a mind and a body. To heal directly at the level of thesoul it is first necessary to acknowledge that you have a soul. If you have asoul, is it a hollowness that mythologically fills your rib cage? No. If, then,your soul is real and alive with force and beingness, what is its purpose?To develop a healthy and disciplined mind, an intellect that can expandwholesomely and fully into any task, requires more than merely recognizing theexistence of the mind. It requires understanding how the mind works, what itdesires, what strengthens it and what weakens it, and then applying thatknowledge. In the same way, it is not possible to consciously assist the soul inits evolution merely by recognizing the existence of the soul. It is necessaryto understand the soul’s temperament, to learn what the soul can tolerate andwhat it cannot tolerate, what contributes to its health and what breaks itshealth down. These things must be looked at.The means for doing this have not yet been developed. We have not yet created adisciplined and systematic understanding of the soul. We do not understand howour behaviors and activities affect the soul. When we see the personality indysfunction, we do not think of what this reveals about the soul. Yet thepersonality is specific aspects of the soul reduced to a physical form.Therefore, dysfunctions of the personality cannot be understood without anunderstanding of the soul.The fears, angers, and jealousies that deform the personality cannot beunderstood apart from the karmic circumstances that they serve. When youunderstand, and truly understand, that the experiences of your life arenecessary to the balancing of the energy of your soul, you are free to not reactto them personally, to not create more negative karma for your soul.Pain by itself is merely pain, but the experience of pain coupled with anunderstanding that the pain serves a worthy purpose is suffering. Suffering ismeaningful. Suffering can be endured because there is a reason for it that isworth the effort. What is more worthy of your pain than the evolution of yoursoul?This does not mean that you become a martyr. When you understand that byconsciously serving the evolution of your soul you contribute the most that youcan to your world, you become one who contributes consciously to the well-beingand spiritual development of those who share the human learning experience withyou. If you are unkind to yourself you will be unkind to others, and if you arenegligent of yourself you will be that to others. Only by feeling compassion foryourself can you feel compassion for others.If you cannot love yourself, you cannot love others and you cannot stand to seeothers loved. If you cannot treat your own self kindly you will resent thattreatment when you see it in anyone else. If you cannot love yourself, lovingothers becomes a very painful endeavor with only occasional moments of comfort.In other words, loving others, or how you treat yourself, is your own dose ofyour own medicine that you really give to others at the same time.Individuals who experience what might be thought of as a martyr attitude seethemselves as giving all that they have to others. They see this as a form ofloving, but in truth the love that they give is contaminated because it is sofilled with sorrow for themselves. A sense of guilt and powerlessness clouds theenergy from their hearts and so when their affection is felt by another it doesnot feel good, actually. It feels somehow thick with need, yet the need is neverarticulated, so their love feels like cement pulling you.When you can do kindly things to yourself then you know what it is to be able tolove yourself. Then you can look at others who desperately need kindness andlove and feel good about their getting it, not patronizing, but truly good. Thisis the energy of the soul. This is the perception of the soul. When there is nocompassion, when there is guilt, remorse, anger, or sorrow, there is opportunityto heal the soul. What is the relationship of these experiences to a healthysoul and to a soul that is not healthy? What is a healthy soul?A spiritual psychology is necessary to answer these questions, a new disciplineof the spirit that is truly of the spirit, that has as its focus the soul of thehuman being. Human evolution, and the evolution of the spirit in matter, is avery specific evolution. It is not haphazard. It is not chaotic. It is veryspecific. When certain necessary processes of the maturation of the union ofmatter and spirit are not honored, the spirit breaks down. Psychologists haveattempted to explain these breakdowns in the terms of psychology. We cancontinue to use that language, but let psychology then expand to include alanguage of the spirit. This will eventually become its first tongue, so tospeak, and all psychoses and psychotic breakdown will finally, eventually, beput into its proper language, which is shattered spirit.Reincarnation and the role of karma in the development of the soul will becentral parts of spiritual psychology. The characteristics of a personality, thequalities that make one personality different from another, cannot beappreciated without an understanding of the karma that created thosecharacteristics. They cannot always be understood in terms of the history of thepersonality because they may reflect experiences that predate the personality,in some cases by centuries. At issue, therefore, is not the effects of anger,jealousy, bitterness, sorrow, and so forth upon the personality, but upon thesoul.An understanding of each of the personalities, each of the lifetimes, of a soulis not necessary. The numerous, numerous lifetimes of a soul are not equallycentral to the development of each of its personalities, but without awarenessof the experiences of those lifetimes that bear directly upon the struggles ofyour personality, you cannot understand the extent of what is being healedthrough your experiences, or seeking to come to conclusion. If your soul was aRoman centurion, an Indian beggar, a Mexican mother, a nomad boy, and a medievalnun, among other incarnations, for example, and if the karmic patterns that wereset into motion within those lifetimes are in motion within you, you will not beable to understand your proclivities, or interests, or ways of responding todifferent situations without an awareness of the experiences of those lifetimes.It may be that the medieval nun of your soul developed an ability to see anAngel. What an extraordinary spiritual achievement! Your nonphysical Teacherwill come to you upon those same frequencies of Light. She gives to you thefruits of a lifetime of contemplation and struggle and pain and courage. TheRoman centurion of your soul is not dead millennia ago. That energy canliterally step into your body and want to hold a modern weapon out of curiosity.Do you dislike certain types of people? Were you drawn to medicine as a child?Are you frightened of small places? Reactions such as these are not alwaysexplainable in terms of the experiences of your life. The healing power at thecore of psychology is the power of consciousness. Seeking out, facing withcourage, and bringing into the Light of consciousness that which isunconsciousness, and, therefore, in a position of power over the personality, iswhat heals. When that which needs to be made conscious is not recognized toexist—such as the experiences of lifetimes that were lived in other places andat other times—it cannot be healed in this way.Have you left a partner or a spouse? Has a spouse or a partner left you? It maybe that your souls have graciously and with great compassion agreed to enactwithin this lifetime a situation that they have experienced together in anotherlifetime, or other lifetimes, a situation that still has healing potential forboth. It may be that your souls have agreed to a mutual balancing of energy, sothat one experiences the same painful loss that it inflicted previously upon theother. Experiences such as these are not meant to cause meaningless pain. Thereis not one act in the Universe that is not compassionate.Your parents are the souls to whom you are closest in your lifetime, and whoseinfluence upon you is the greatest. This is so even if it does not appear thatway, even if, for example, you were separated from your parents, or a parent, atbirth. Your soul and the souls of your parents agreed to your relationship inorder to balance the energy that each needed to balance, or to activate dynamicswithin each other that are essential to lessons that each must learn. Without anawareness of your karmic interactions, of the experiences of other lifetimes ofyour soul, you are not able to understand the depth of the potential awakeningsthat can result from your interactions with a parent, or a sibling.The exploration and understanding of intuition will be a central part ofspiritual psychology. Intuition is the voice of the nonphysical world. It is thecommunication system that releases the five-sensory personality from thelimitations of its five-sensory system, that permits the multisensorypersonality to be multisensory. It is the connection between the personality andits higher self and its guides and Teachers.Psychology does not even recognize the intuition, except as a curiosity.Therefore, it does not recognize the knowledge that is obtained through theintuition, and, therefore, this knowledge is not processed by the intellect. Thefive-sensory personality processes only the knowledge that it gathers andsubstantiates through its five senses. The multisensory personality acquiresknowledge through its intuition, and, in processing that knowledge, alignsitself, step by step, with its soul. The conscious path to authentic powerrequires recognition of the nonphysical dimensions of the human being, of thesoul, and a growing knowledge of what the soul is and what it wants.Spirituality will be at the core of spiritual psychology. Spiritual psychologywill be oriented toward spirituality and spiritual crises will be consideredlegitimate sufferings. Spiritual psychology will trace and understand thefunctional relationships between karma, reincarnation, intuition, andspirituality.Spirituality has to do with the immortal process itself. You have yourintuition, for example, but your spirituality is not limited to your personalityand its intuitional system. Your spirituality encompasses your whole soul’sjourney, whereas your intuition is the way that your soul can contact yourbeingness to help it in survival situations, or in creative situations, or ininspirational situations. It is the way that, through your higher self, you canask and receive assistance from other souls and from your Teachers and guides.Your spirituality pertains to that which is immortal within you, whereas, whenyou leave your body, the intuitional system that was developed for that bodywill be left behind because it will no longer be necessary.Spiritual psychology is a disciplined and systematic study of what is necessaryto the health of the soul. It will identify behaviors that operate in oppositionto harmony and wholeness, in opposition to the energy of the soul. It willconsider the broad-reaching elements of negativity, and how many forms ofnegativity there are, and the effects of these upon the soul.Anything that increases separation within a person shatters the soul or in someform diminishes its strength, not to be confused with its immortality. The soul,as it reduces itself to fit into a physical incarnation, has the blueprint ofholism in it. A genetic spiritual pattern, so to speak, of holism is there andpresent, and when the personality operates outside of the genetic pattern ofholism, dysfunction results.Spiritual psychology will bring to light those situations that would shatter thespirit if seen clearly. Brutality, for example, shatters the human spirit. Thesoul cannot tolerate brutality. It cannot tolerate abundances of pain andirrationality. It cannot tolerate being lied to. Consider that on our planet. Itcannot tolerate non-forgiveness. It cannot tolerate jealousies and hatreds.These are contaminants, poisons, for it.When the personality engages in these behaviors, it is as though it feeds itsbody arsenic again and again. It is just like that. These behaviors distort andcontaminate and destroy the strength of the soul, in the same way. This is thedistortedness of the soul that the physical reduced counterpart of the soul,called the personality, takes on in order to cleanse, in order to let othersouls see so that it can be helped.Understanding this dynamic is at the heart of spiritual psychology. It is thefoundation upon which spiritual psychology is built so that when pain is seen itis not responded to with judgment or ugliness or avoidance, but recognized asthe soul shattered. In this way, we shall say, in this circumstance, let us healhim. Let us heal her. Let us not run from the unattractiveness of a shatteredsoul.The personality of a shattered soul is unaware. There is a continual interactionbetween your personality and your soul. The question is are you aware of it orare you not? If you are not aware of it, then it is not direct. It is indirectthrough having to move its currents through the density of doubt, through thedensity of unawareness. If you are aware of the guidance from your higher self,and are receptive to it, that receptivity allows guidance to flow instantly andimmediately. If you are unaware and deny that there is any level of higherwisdom and guidance to your life, then the guidance must come through thedensity of physical events.Awareness first enters into an unaware personality through crisis. When thepersonality is not attached to, or is apart from, clear soul energy, it becomesseduced into the physical matterness of life. That always results in apersonality crisis because the necessary strength and guidance that are meant toflow into the personality have been cut off. The personality that is unaware of,or denies the existence of, its higher sources of wisdom cannot draw upon itsguidance, its intuition, or any of the guiding mechanisms of our species.Therefore, crisis results.Was it meant that crisis be central to our growth? No. This pattern evolvedthrough the choices that were made by our species. The flow of our evolution didnot have to include this pattern of crisis. It did not have to include theexperiences of pain and trauma, of emotional or physical violence and brutalityin order to grow. It was given in Divine order that our species would move intowholeness at some point in its evolution. How it moved and learned in the courseof its evolution was left to be determined by the choices that our species madeof how to maneuver energy within the Earth school. Doubt was created and chosenas the major teacher through human choice itself. Our species chose this way oflearning, and, therefore, set karmic patterns into motion, generational karmicpatterns.As our species evolved, as it experienced its spectrum of fears, its spectrum ofdesires, its spectrum of attachments to the physical, collectively andindividually certain choices began to characterize and form the path that wouldbe most familiar to us. Awakening into the need to touch something more, totouch one’s own spiritual energy system, is now a well-worn path that includesthe experience of becoming physically powerless in relation to the structure ofthe Earth school before the soul will reach for genuine power.In other words, the awakening of the personality to the potential of the soulhas come to require the loss of a mate, or the death of a child, or the collapseof a business, or some situation that renders the individual powerless. Itrequires the failure of external power. That, to the five-sensory personality,is crisis.Spiritual psychology addresses this situation by addressing directly the issueof authentic power. It is timely because it comes at a time when our species isevolving beyond the five-sensory personality, beyond learning throughfive-sensory exploration of the physical world, which is external power, andinto the experiences of the multisensory personality, the experiences of thenonphysical world and the conscious journey toward authentic power throughresponsible choice with the assistance of nonphysical guides and Teachers.The personality, including the five-sensory personality, is neither positive nornegative. It is a tool of the soul, a natural part of incarnation. Thedevelopment of the five senses was a celebration in which the intellect wasexpanded and our species was allowed to learn through physical matter. The questfor external power came to be generated by insecurity not because of thelimitations of the five-sensory personality, but because of the choices thatwere made by our species to learn through fear and doubt instead of throughwisdom.Our species is again being given the chance to choose how it will learn, how itwill evolve. This is a time for us as a species and as individuals to chooseagain. It is an opportunity for us as a species and as individuals to choosedifferently, to choose otherwise, to choose this time to learn love throughwisdom, to take the vertical path of clarity, of conscious growth and consciouslife.We are coming to the end of a phase of evolution that was written long before weexisted. When the learning and evolution of our species was designed, it wasdesigned to complement cycles, great cycles that work within the Universe,within our galaxy and within others. These cycles move within physical form atcertain speeds, serving certain purposes and balances of energies.The cycle that we are ending, and, therefore, beginning, is of a moment in whichthree cycles come to conclusion and begin again. These cycles act one inside ofthe other. Just as the moon orbits the earth which orbits the sun and there areorbits within orbits, so, too, there are cycles within cycles. We are coming tothe close of a grand cycle astrologically, a two thousand year cycle, and aneven grander cycle, where a twenty-five thousand year cycle is linking with aconclusion of a one hundred and twenty-five thousand year cycle. That is whythese things, within this moment in our evolution, are happening now. This iswhen they were meant to be.The negativity of the last two thousand year cycle is being collected now sothat it can be discharged and transformed, so that the next cycle of twothousand years which starts with the next beginning cycle of twenty-fivethousand years and the next beginning cycle of one hundred twenty-five thousandyears, all three simultaneously, can begin fresh.This is what this present situation and moment upon our Earth is about: thebirth of very different opportunities, opportunities to release patterns thatare no longer necessary. The more Light, literally, the more en-Lightened thatyou are, the more you will choose different ways.Spiritual psychology will support the choice to learn through wisdom, the choiceto release patterns of negativity, of doubt and fear, that are no longerappropriate to who we are and what we are becoming. It will make clear therelationship between the personality and the soul, the differences between them,and how to recognize those differences. It will make explicit the effects ofinteractions between personalities from the perspective of the impersonal energydynamics that they set into motion, and it will show how these dynamics can beused to heal.1 [part0026.html#footnote-6930-13]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [part0026.html#footnote-6930-13-backlink]. To learn how to apply what you havelearned in this chapter and deepen your experiences, see the Chapter 13 StudyGuide on page 312 [part0046.html#1BRPS0-ffe35c2ad53849cca826336987d3fbe4]."},{"pageContent":"Images [../images/00011.jpeg] 14 Images [../images/00011.jpeg]ILLUSIONEach interaction with each individual is part of a continual learning dynamic.When you interact with another, an illusion is part of this dynamic. Thisillusion allows each soul to perceive what it needs to understand in order toheal. It creates, like a living picture show, the situations that are necessaryto bring into wholeness the aspects of each soul that require healing.The illusion is a learning vehicle. It is of the personality. You will leave theillusion behind when you die, when you return home. Yet a personality that livesin love and Light, that sees through the eyes of its soul, metaphoricallyspeaking, can see the illusion and simultaneously not be drawn into it. This isan authentically empowered personality.The illusion is exquisitely intimate to the needs of each soul. Always eachsituation serves each person involved. You cannot, and will not, encounter acircumstance, or a single moment, that does not serve directly and immediatelythe need of your soul to heal, to come into wholeness. The illusion for eachsoul is created by its intentions. Therefore, the illusion is alive at eachmoment with the most appropriate experiences that you can have in order for yoursoul to heal.The illusion is malleable. This does not mean that what is created jointlywithin the illusion does not have an independence of the individual souls thatparticipated in its creation. It means that there is no perception that cannotbe healed, just as there is no intention that cannot be changed, or replacedwith another. Understanding how the illusion comes into being, how it works, thedynamics behind it, and the role that it plays in the evolution of the soul isat the heart of spiritual psychology.Spiritual psychology allows the personality to detach itself from the illusionand, therefore, to see it from a knowledgeable perspective, to see it in action.Just as, for example, an intelligence with a knowledge of modern medicine wouldbe able to live among the populations of Europe during the time of the bubonicplague and not be affected by it, a personality with knowledge of the illusionand how it works is able to live within it and not be affected by it.Bubonic plague is transmitted by fleas on rodents. This is known now but it wasnot known then. By keeping his or her environment clean, by avoiding all thatattracts rodents, and by practicing personal hygiene, such a person could notonly survive, but also keep others safe as well. When we experience fear oranger or jealousy, we are in an illusion that is designed to bring to awarenessthose parts of the soul that require healing. These things do not actuallyexist. That is why pursuing them does not bring power. What exists between soulsis love, and that is all that exists. By understanding this, the personality isable to remain aware within the illusion, to accept consciously the healing thatit offers, and to help others heal as well. The power of awareness and knowledgeis identical in both situations.The illusion holds power over you when you are not able to remember that you area powerful spirit that has taken on the physical experience for the purpose oflearning. It has power over you when you are compelled by the wants and impulsesand values of your personality. It holds power over you when you fear and hateand sorrow and fester in anger or strike out in rage. It has no power over youwhen you love, when compassion opens your heart to others, when your creativityflows unimpeded joyously into the present moment. In other words, the illusionhas no power over a personality that is fully aligned with its soul.The illusion is governed by impersonal energy dynamics. It is shaped initiallyby the law of karma. The configuration of each personality, the unconsciousintentions with which it is born, is determined by the karma of its soul. Theseintentions shape that personality’s illusion, its reality within the Earthschool, until they are replaced by other intentions, unconscious or conscious.If the reactions of the personality create additional karma for the soul, and ifthat karma cannot be balanced within the lifetime of the personality, that karmacontributes to the shaping of another personality, and the intentions of thatpersonality create its illusion, its reality within the Earth school, and so on.Even after a personality becomes conscious and aware of its illusion, and setsits intentions accordingly, the karmic obligations of its soul must still bemet. Karma is karma. Energy is energy. The awakened personality understandsthis, and therefore, does not respond to the experiences and the events of itslife with anger, fear, sorrow, or jealousy, which would create additionalnegative karma for its soul, but with compassion and with trust that theUniverse, in each moment, is attending to the needs of its soul. This draws toit other souls with the same frequency of consciousness.Each personality draws to itself personalities with consciousness of likefrequency, or like weakness. The frequency of anger attracts the frequency ofanger, the frequency of greed attracts greed, and so on. This is the law ofattraction. Negativity attracts negativity, just as love attracts love.Therefore, the world of an angry person is filled with angry people, the worldof a greedy person is filled with greedy people, and a loving person lives in aworld of loving people.The law of attraction creates a cocoon, so to speak, of like energy around eachpersonality so that as it seeks to heal its anger, or its fear, or its jealousy,the metamorphosis process into wholeness is intensified and accelerated, isbrought to the center of the stage of awareness. The personality sees its angeror its fear not only within itself, but everywhere outside itself as well. Ifthe personality chooses consciously to heal its anger, or its fear, everycircumstance, every encounter becomes irritating or fearful as the Universecompassionately responds to its desire to become whole."},{"pageContent":"Images [../images/00015.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":"As the anger, or the fear, within a personality builds, the world in which itlives increasingly reflects the anger, or the fear, that it must heal, so thateventually, ultimately, the personality will see that it is creating its ownexperiences and perceptions, that its righteous anger or justifiable fearoriginates within itself, and therefore can be replaced by other perceptions andexperiences only through the force of its own being.Just as the frequency of anger evokes a like frequency in the consciousness ofthose around an angry personality, the frequency of love awakens also likeresponses. It is the intention that determines the effect. If what you offer toothers is not sensitive, if it does not support and nourish, if it does notempower but disempowers them, it will be met with resistance at some level, andthat resistance will be the counterpart of your energy that seeks to disempower,or to control. Separation and distance are always the result of the pursuit ofexternal power.Within this impersonal framework operate the dynamics of temptation andresponsible choice.The human emotional system can be broken down into roughly two elements: fearand love. Love is of the soul. Fear is of the personality. The illusion of eachpersonality is generated by and sustained by the emotions that follow fear, suchas anger, rage, vengefulness, hatred, jealousy or envy, loneliness, spite,sorrow, despair, grief, regret, greed, lust, arrogance, alienation, self-pity,lethargy, guilt, resentment, and feelings of inferiority and superiority.Emotions such as these lead to corresponding behaviors, such asselfishness—toward people and animals and the Earth and the kingdoms of theEarth—and using others in the many ways that humans use oneanother—commercially, sexually, emotionally—and lying, manipulation, violence,brutality, impatience, ridicule, and judgment.When the personality is unconscious, every emotion of fear, or that followsfear, produces a negative behavior, a behavior that creates negative karma forits soul. Each of the emotions that follows fear can cause any of the behaviorsthat are based upon fear. Jealousy, for example, can result in lying, or inridicule, which are forms of manipulation, or in violence. Greed can result inimpatience, which is a form of selfishness, or judging or using others.If you are unconscious of the part of yourself that is angry, for example, ifyou are unaware of yourself as a splintered personality, you will enact theanger of that part of yourself without thinking. You will strike out, orwithdraw, or ridicule, or in some way express your anger. Your anger will spillout of your private energy sphere and into the collective energy of those aroundyou, creating negative karma. As you encounter the results of your own anger, asthey come back to you through the laws of karma and attraction, you, or anotherof your soul’s personalities, eventually will learn to create differently, andso on for each of the negative emotions that follows fear.Behind fear is powerlessness. As you reach outward to fill the places within youthat are empty of power, you learn, one by one, that those places cannot befilled in that way. Eventually, whether in this lifetime, or after a thousandlifetimes, you will turn toward authentic power. This is the unconscious way oflearning. It is learning through the experiences that are created by theunconscious parts of the personality, and through the experiences that arecreated by unconscious reactions to those experiences.If a personality is aware of its splintered state, if it is aware not only ofthe aspect of itself that is angry and demands vengeance, for example, but alsoof the aspect of itself that is compassionate and understanding, it benefitsfrom the dynamic of temptation. It is able to preview the consequences ofidentifying with the frequency of energy that is anger that is running throughits system, to look them over in advance of living them, and to decide whetherthey are worth expressing the anger that it feels. It is able to foresee,through its decision to foresee, how expressing the current of anger in thatmoment will affect itself and the people around it, and also the effects ofexpressing understanding and compassion.The unconscious personality is not aware in the moment of its anger or its ragethat there are aspects of itself that would prefer to respond with compassionand understanding, but it would recognize them if it could see clearly in thatmoment. What of the parts of itself that suffer the loneliness and alienationthat result from expressing anger, the parts that long for warmth andcompanionship, for relationships of a depth and quality that are not possible tothose who live in anger or fear or jealousy?If the personality that is tempted decides to align itself with love, withclarity, understanding, and compassion, it gains power. The impulse towardanger, or resentment, or vengeance loses power over it, and in this way, step bystep, conscious decision by conscious decision, it becomes truly powerful. If itdecides to remain unconscious, to avoid responsibility for its actions, itallows negative currents of energy to form its words and shape its actions. Thisresults in negative behavior, and this results in negative karma.What does this mean in terms of the illusion?Negative behavior produces within others and within oneself negative emotionsand, therefore, more opportunities to gain power through responsible choice orto create negative karma. Negative karma means that the personality that choosesnegative behavior, or another of its soul’s personalities, will experience thatsame negative behavior from another personality, and, again, be given theopportunity to decide to release or continue that mode of learning.This is the illusion. It is an illusion because you and the other souls that areinvolved have agreed, in compassion and wisdom, to participate in the learningdynamics of the Earth school in order to heal. It is illusion because withinnonphysical reality neither space nor time nor anger nor jealousy nor fearexists. It is an illusion because when you return home it will cease to be.Therefore, how are you to judge a soul that is involved in this learningprocess? What step, or steps, do you abstract and say, “This is wrong,” “That isworthy,” “Here she has succeeded” and “Here he has not”? You cannot judge thelearnings of a soul on the basis of how that learning takes place withoutcreating negative karma. In other words, a soul is capable of being examined inprocess. Just as you can ask yourself, “Where does my anger come from?” andrealize that it springs from a multitude of dynamics, some of which were setinto motion centuries ago, or longer, and that are only now coming tocompletion, that it is a current of energy within you that you are seeking torelease in order to heal your soul and balance its karmic energy, you cannot tryanother as if you were a judge in a court for a single angry experience. Ratheryou would have to see clearly that there is a process unfolding and add to thatthe factor of karma.You can only judge that the soul is involved by its own will in a process ofhealing, and that it is evolving, as are you, and as is the rest of theUniverse. This is non-judgmental justice. It is justice that does not judge theprocess of the soul’s evolution except that it recognize with love that the soulis reaching for love.It is not the way of the Universe to look through the eyes of right and wrongand failure or success. How do you know what “success” is? Can you see infullness the causes and effects of your being and of your acts and of yourwords? Therefore, how do you know what success is, and how can you possiblyimagine what failure is? What is “failure” but a cause and effect? What we callfailure is simply a cause and its effect, simply the process of cause and effectin action. It is wise to imagine the dynamics that we think of as “failure” and“success” as not truly existing, because they do not, not from the position oftruth, only from the position of judgment.How can you say what within the illusion is worthy and what is not?“Unworthiness” is the judgment of not being perfected, but look around you. Doyou see perfection completed by each human being, except that they are, in theirown process, perfect and worthy? It is the process that is worthy and perfect atall times, and in that you complete the task fully.How is it possible to know what to pursue within the illusion and what not topursue?Ask yourself what is the difference between your essential needs and youradopted needs, or perhaps another term might be artificial needs. What are yourgenuine needs, and what are the needs that you have created for other reasons,to control, or to maneuver others, or to gain attention? Distinguish these inyour mind. Know yourself deeply and clearly enough to recognize what is alegitimate need of you as a human being and of you as that part of yourself thathas created needs for certain other reasons—such as to gain external notice, orprestige, or to become a distinguishable individual. Learn to identify these andthen choose which you wish to live with.For example, is your irritation at the neighbor’s noise a result of a genuineneed that is going unmet, or a created need? Does your annoyance with the soundsthat the garbage truck makes, or your desire to have the clerk at the grocerystore treat you politely, reflect an essential need or an artificial one? Learnto distinguish your real needs, what you truly need as a human being and a soul,from the needs that you have adopted for reasons that are based on externalpower and do not emerge from the needs of your soul. Once you get a clear senseof that you can begin to separate yourself from your artificial self, and thenyou are in a position to choose clearly how you wish to respond, and to holdyourself accountable when you allow your artificial needs to take over.Authentic needs belong to the soul. You need, for example, to love and to beloved. You need to express your creativity, whether that is in raising a familyor leading a country. You need to cultivate your spirit, to work consciously ataligning your personality with your soul. You need to be counseled with theimpersonal wisdom of your nonphysical Teachers, and the guidance of yournonphysical guides. These are some of your authentic needs.Nonauthentic needs belong to the personality. They are what you adopt in yourphysical life in order to maneuver the space you claim and walk in upon theEarth. Artificial needs are the needs from which negative karma is incurred. Asyou reach to fulfill these needs without letting them go and bending andflowing, as you determine to have them satisfied or to use them, you can gaingreat negative karma.A nonauthentic need is a barrier. Neither nations nor individuals need as muchas they have. They are artificial barriers, and the purpose behind theirformation is the accumulation of external power. The secondary gain, so tospeak, behind the creation of artificial needs is artificial power. Look clearlyand you will see it everywhere—in marriages, in international relations, inevery conflict.It is not possible for you to experience the complete emergence of your soulwhen you are clouded over by artificial needs. When that happens all you can seeare artificial needs, and you see them as being ever so important, ever sosignificant, but are they really? As you look at your not-as-authentic needs,can you see how they drain energy from you? So long as your priorities come fromyour lesser self, you cannot touch your higher self in a direct way.Authentic needs are the needs that are always met by the Universe. The Universeis that which supplies you with your authentic needs. You are always being givenopportunities to love and be loved, for example, yet ask yourself how many timesin your life you have squandered these opportunities.By learning to respond to your authentic needs and by allowing your artificialones to drop aside as unnecessary defense mechanisms, you become more open andunderstanding and compassionate with others. There is a natural give and take inthe course of every human life. Each human being has authentic and nonauthenticneeds, and that is where the natural grit for the flow between us comes from inthe living environment. You begin to learn to give and take as you begin to workthrough an understanding of what your real needs are, and learn to compromiseand give and transcend when it comes to the needs of those parts of yourselfthat are not genuine or do not enhance your development.If you see clearly through your own authentic needs, you will see that what youare really feeling threatened by when you experience an artificial need is theloss of your power, and, therefore, rather than being able to address itdirectly, you create an artificial need that does the speaking for you. Learn toaddress the real need so that you do not have to burden yourself with behavioralpatterns that are not true to your own nature, that cloud you, that give yousome artificial persona that you have to live up to.Begin by truly watching your own needs in action—where they are real and wherethey are not, and where they are not, expect to experience a negative emotion.Work on becoming one step detached from that feeling so that you are no longerblinded by it or unaware that you are feeling it. Become a step away so that youcan let it begin to work its way through you without penetrating as deeply as itdoes in terms of creating action and negative thoughts and emotional withdrawalsand all the other reactions it creates within you. Become one step detached fromit, and every time that you are able to see it you will become more and more andmore detached.You will begin to be able to see the illusion in motion, and that is a part ofauthentic power.1 [part0029.html#footnote-6930-14]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [part0029.html#footnote-6930-14-backlink]. To learn how to apply what you havelearned in this chapter and deepen your experiences, see the Chapter 14 StudyGuide on page 317 [part0047.html#1CQAE0-ffe35c2ad53849cca826336987d3fbe4]."},{"pageContent":"Images [../images/00011.jpeg] 15 Images [../images/00011.jpeg]POWERWhat is the nature of power? What does it mean to be a truly powerful humanbeing?Power is not the ability to exert your will upon another person. There is noinner security in that kind of power. That is an attribute of time, and as timechanges, that changes, too. Do you have a strong body that others cannotchallenge? That will change. What will you do then? Do you have a physicalbeauty that can be used to influence others? That will change. What will you dothen? Do you have a cleverness that maneuvers others? What happens when you aretoo tired to use it, or you miss the opportunity?If you are not at home in the world, you live in the fear of one who can nevertruly relax and enjoy Life. Is this power? There is no power in fear, or in anyof the activities that are generated by fear. There is no power in a thoughtform of fear, even if it is supported by armies. The armies of Rome disappearedmore than a millennium ago, but the force of the life of a single human thatRoman soldiers put to death continues to shape the development of our species.Who had the power?You are only as powerful as that for which you stand. Do you stand for moremoney in the bank and a bigger house? Do you stand for an attractive mate? Doyou stand for imposing your way of thinking upon others? These are the stands ofthe personality seeking to satisfy its wants. Do you stand for perfection, forthe beauty and compassion of each soul? Do you stand for the power of love andthe clarity of wisdom? Do you stand for forgiveness and humbleness? These arethe stands of the personality that has aligned itself with its soul. This is theposition of a truly powerful personality.Power is energy that is formed by the intentions of the soul. It is Light shapedby the intentions of love and compassion guided by wisdom. It is energy that isfocused and directed toward the fulfillment of the tasks of the soul upon theEarth, and the development of the personality as a physical instrument of thesoul that is appropriate to those tasks. It is the force that shapes theillusion into the images of the souls that are creating it, and not those oftheir personalities.What does this mean?There is a continual energy exchange between souls. This exchange is splinteredwhen the personality is splintered. Energy, power, leaves a splinteredpersonality through each of its different parts. If one part of you fears theloss of your job, and another fears the loss of a relationship, and anotherdreads confrontation with an unpleasant co-worker, power flows from you withoutyour conscious control. This is how the energy dynamics of an unempoweredpersonality work.When energy leaves you in fear or distrust, it cannot bring you anything butdiscomfort or pain. When energy flows from your system in fear or distrust, youexperience a physical feeling of pain or discomfort in the part of your bodythat is associated with the particular energy center that is losing power. Whenyou fear for your ability to protect and care for yourself in the world, to payyour rent, for example, or to keep yourself safe from physical or emotionalharm—when you see power as external and you feel that you do not have enough ofit to insure your well-being or your safety—you experience discomfort or pain inthe area of your stomach, in the area of your solar plexus. What we call anxietyis the experience of power leaving through the energy center that is located inthis area of the body. An anxiety attack is a massive loss of power from yoursystem through that energy center. Power losses affect the surrounding parts ofthe body. Power loss through this center, for example, can cause indigestion. Ifit is chronic or acute, it can ulcerate the stomach.When you fear that your ability to love or to be loved is threatened, when youfear, for example, expressing your own love or receiving love from another, youexperience physical discomfort or pain in the region of your chest, near yourheart. What we experience, literally, as heartache is the experience of powerleaving in fear or distrust through this energy center. Have you lost a mate, ora child, or someone very dear to you? Sort through your experience. Determinewhat it is that you felt. You will discover that your body hurt, that you werein pain in the vicinity of your chest. That is the experience of power leavingthrough that energy center. That is what a heartache is, the loss of powerthrough your heart center. Chronic or acute loss of power through the heartcenter results, literally, in an attack of the heart. There is more tomyocardial infarction, to heart attack, than cholesterol in the blood and otherconditions of the physical system.Every distress and every dysfunction of the physical body, every illness, can beunderstood in terms of power loss to an external circumstance or object throughone of several energy centers within the body. You lose power when you rageagainst an injustice. You lose power when you are threatened by another person,or other people. You lose power when you distance yourself from your fellowhumans out of resentment or bitterness, or a sense of disappointment orunworthiness or superiority. You lose power when you long for something orsomeone, when you grieve, and when you envy another. Beneath all of these isfear, fear that you are vulnerable, that you are not able to cope without theperson or the situation that you miss, that you are at a disadvantage withoutthat which you envy. You lose power whenever you fear. That is what a loss ofpower is.You do not stop losing power by refusing to recognize your fear, byanesthetizing yourself to what you feel. The road to authentic power is alwaysthrough what you feel, through your heart. The way of the heart is one ofcompassion and emotional perception. Therefore, it is never appropriate tosuppress an emotion, or to disregard what you feel. If you do not know what youfeel, you cannot come to know the splintered nature of your personality, and tochallenge those aspects and those energies that do not serve your development.By remaining in your power you do not become a static energy system, one thathoards energy to itself. You become a stable energy system, capable of consciousacts of focus and intention. You become a magnet for those who are illumined andthose who want to be. At issue is the manner in which energy flows from you.When energy leaves you in any way except in strength and trust, it cannot bringback to you anything but pain and discomfort. An authentically empowered humanbeing, therefore, is a human being that does not release its energy except inlove and trust.What are the characteristics of an authentically empowered human being?An authentically empowered person is humble. This does not mean the falsehumility of one who stoops to be with those who are below him or her. It is theinclusiveness of one who responds to the beauty of each soul, who sees in eachpersonality and in the actions of each personality the soul incarnate upon theEarth. It is the harmlessness of one who treasures and honors and reveres Lifein all its forms. Are you concerned for the Earth? It is the humble who havenever harmed the Earth.What does it mean to be harmless?It means being so strong that you need not harm a creature. That is what itmeans: you are so able and empowered that the idea of showing power through harmis not even a part of your consciousness. Without genuine humility, you cannothave this kind of power because power leaves you when you feel that thesituation that you are in, or the people that you are with, do not command yourrespect.A humble spirit walks a familiar world. People are not strangers to it; they areits companions upon the Earth. A humble spirit does not ask for more than itneeds, and what it needs, the Universe provides. A humble spirit is content withthe fulfillment of its authentic needs, and is not burdened with artificialneeds.Humble spirits are free to love and to be who they are. They have no artificialstandards to live up to. They are not drawn to the symbols of external power.They do not compete for external power. This does not mean that they do not takepride in what they can do well, or that they do not focus their efforts toproduce the best that they can, or are not spurred onward by their fellow humanswhen that is appropriate to the situation.To compete means to strive for something in company or together, to aim atsomething, to try to reach something, to seek after something with others. Ifthe something that you aim for is prestige or notice or a gold medal instead ofa tin medal, it is your personality that is motivating the competition. You arestriving to empower yourself at the expense of others, to assert yoursuperiority over another, or over other human beings. You are striving forexternal power. By striving for this reward and that reward, you ask the worldto assess and acknowledge your value before you can value yourself. You placeyour sense of self-worth in the hands of others. You have no power even if youwin every gold medal that the world can produce.If what you seek is the joy of giving without reservation, of giving withpurpose and joy and consciousness all that you have to the effort that you andother souls are creating jointly, your competition is the expression of yoursoul. When the effort that finishes last in time has the same value as theeffort that finishes first, when the quality of the immortal, timeless soul ishonored instead of the time-bound personality and body, when your giving is notimpeded by fear of vulnerability, when the size or color or shape of what youreceive or do not receive does not matter, you will know the power of a humblespirit.An authentically empowered person is one who forgives. Forgiveness is not amoral issue. It is an energy dynamic. When most people forgive they do not wantthose that they forgave to forget that they forgave and forgot. This kind offorgiveness manipulates the person who is forgiven. It is not forgiveness. It isa means of acquiring external power over another.Forgiveness means that you do not carry the baggage of an experience. When youchoose not to forgive, the experience that you do not forgive sticks with you.When you choose not to forgive, it is like agreeing to wear dark, gruesomesunglasses that distort everything, and it is you who are forced every day tolook at Life through those contaminated lenses because you have chosen to keepthem. You wish everyone else to see the world that way because you wish to seethe world that way, and it is indeed the world that you are looking at, but itis only you who sees it. You are looking through the lenses of your owncontaminated love.Forgiveness means that you do not hold others responsible for your experiences.If you do not hold yourself accountable for what you experience, you will holdsomeone else accountable, and if you are not satisfied with what you experience,you will seek to change it by manipulating that person. Complaining, forexample, is exactly that dynamic of wanting someone to be responsible for whatyou experience, and to fix things for you.Complaining is a form of manipulation, but you are free to move beyond that intothe next step, which is perception and sharing without manipulation. What is atstake is not your sharing, but the intention behind it. When complaining is usedinstead of sharing, that is what becomes negative, but not the sharing. It ishow you cast the sharing, or shape it, before—the intention with which youshare. Before you share, ask yourself, “What is my intention in sharing this? AmI looking for a particular response?” Use this as a way of centering yourattitude before committing energy to words. When you assume responsibility forwhat you experience and share what you experience in a spirit of companionship,that is the same as forgiveness.When you hold someone responsible for what you experience, you lose power. Youcannot know what another person will do. Therefore, when you depend upon anotherperson for the experiences that you think are necessary to your well-being, youlive continually in the fear that they will not deliver. The perception thatsomeone else is responsible for what you experience underlies the idea thatforgiveness is something that one person does for another. How can you forgiveanother person for the fact that you have chosen to step out of your power?When you forgive you release critical judgment of yourself as well as of others.You lighten up. You do not cling to negative experiences that resulted fromdecisions that you made while you were learning. That is regret. Regret is thedouble negativity of clinging to negativity. You lose power when you regret. Ifone person grieves at his or her experiences while another is able to laugh, whois the lighter? Which is harmless? The heart that dances is the innocent heart.The one that cannot laugh is burdened. It is the dancing heart that is harmless.This does not mean that you do not learn from what you have experienced, andapply that in each moment as you make your decisions. That is responsiblechoice. If you are doing all that you can to the fullest of your ability as wellas you can, there is nothing else that is asked of a soul.An authentically empowered human being is clear in his or her perceptions andthinking. Clarity is the perception of wisdom. It is seeing with wisdom. It isbeing able to perceive and understand the illusion, and to let it play. It isbeing able to see beyond the activities of the personality to the force of theimmortal soul. It is being able to understand what it is that is striving tocome into being—the health and integration of the personality and the evolutionof the soul. It is the ability to recognize nonphysical dynamics as they appearwithin the world of time and matter. It is understanding the laws of karma andattraction and their relationship to what you experience. It is being able tosee the role of responsible choice and choosing accordingly in each moment.Clarity is the ability to see the soul in action in the physical world. Itresults from choosing to learn through wisdom instead of through fear and doubt.Clarity allows you to experience your fellow humans with compassion instead ofwith judgment. Can you not see the karma that another is creating for himself orherself by choosing the currents of anger or greed? Have you not made the samechoices yourself? Have you not felt vulnerable? Have you not struck out atothers? Clarity brings forth true compassion, the sharing of passion withothers. It allows the energy of the heart to flow.Clarity turns pain into suffering. It sees the dynamic of the personality thatis the cause of the pain, and the relationship of that dynamic and thatexperience to the evolution of the soul. It is the perception in each momentthat everything is designed for wholeness and perfection, and every aspectserves ultimately a beautiful learning. An authentically empowered personalitysees the perfection of each situation and each experience for the evolution ofeach soul and the maturation of each personality involved. It sees perfection inthe smallest details everywhere. Wherever it looks, it sees the hand of God.Clarity evaporates fear. It allows you to choose the vertical path and to stayon it. It allows you to understand the dynamics beneath your addictions—whatyour addictions serve and how they operate—and to make the choices that willdisempower them and empower you. It allows you to challenge not merely a forcethat you do not understand, such as attraction to alcohol, or a drug, orindiscriminate sex, but a dynamic that you understand in terms of its causes andits effects. It allows you to choose consciously, and to know why you arechoosing as you do.Clarity allows you to see the world of physical matter for what it is, alearning environment that is created jointly by the intentions of the souls thatshare it. Therefore, it allows you to recognize the effects of the intentionsthat shape the personal reality of each human at work at levels of reality thatare created jointly. It allows you to see, for example, the extent to whichrelationships between nations have been shaped by the energy of the personalityand the extent to which they have been shaped by the energy of the soul, and torecognize that the energy of the soul is entirely lacking at this level, and atmost others.Clarity allows you to see that the decision-making process within the humancondition is linked to the evolution of others, and in what way. It allows youto see that you participate in the evolution of joint energy dynamics, such asthe archetypes—the collective human ideas—of sacred partnership, male, female,wife, and priest through the decisions that you make. It allows you to see thatyour contribution to the evolution of your soul is precisely the decisions thatyou make at each moment, and that those decisions are embodied in the physicalreality that you share with your fellow humans.An authentically empowered person lives in love. Love is the energy of the soul.Love is what heals the personality. There is nothing that cannot be healed bylove. There is nothing but love.Love is not a passive state. It is an active force. It is the force of the soul.Love does more than bring peace where there is conflict. It brings a differentway of being in the world. It brings harmony and an active interest in thewell-being of others. It brings concern and care. It brings Light. It washesaway the concerns of the personality. In the Light of love there is only love.There is a relationship between love and power and the transformation of thequality of experiences that occur within the Earth school as a whole. The typeof power that you are trying to transform in yourself is the type of power thatneeds to be transformed in general upon the Earth. There are numerous, numerous,numerous human beings who are drawn to violence—violent fantasies and violentacts. Most of them essentially center in the fact that the individual himself orherself feels powerless and victimized and, therefore, wants to live, for abrief period of time with one other human being, a sense of being empowered, butthere is no genuine power to be found in that area.It is through the evolution of your own consciousness, through focusing on moreand more empowered choices, that you create the distance that is necessarybetween you and your negative emotions, and heal yourself in such a way thatviolence no longer asserts itself. To heal violence there must be love.Love is the energy of the soul, and, therefore, the experience of giving andreceiving love, of living a life of love, fulfills the personality. It issomething that the personality continually reaches for. Reaching for loveunconsciously can produce anger and fear. This happens when the personality doesnot see clearly what it is reaching for, which is the case with addiction.If you reach for an addictive sexual relationship, for example, you are reachingfor love. It is the illusion that you think that you are reaching for somethingso manly or womanly. You are reaching for love, but you will not admit it andwill not deal with it, so there is anger within you because there is a level ofenergy and emotion that longs to be born but is never given an outlet.It is emotionally, spiritually impossible to have a sexual connection with ahuman being and not ignite certain emotional patterns, but they are a continualdead-end street when there is no relationship or true emotional feelings to gowith the act. Therefore, there is a level of brutality, frustration, andeventually emotional disease which results in physical illness and breakdownbecause a significant pattern is being tremendously abused. Remember, you do getwhat you ask for.Asking for love is asking for the energy of the soul. It brings with it agenuine concern for the other. You cannot prey upon someone whose well-being isin your heart.When you seek to impose your intelligence or your way of seeing upon another,you are reaching for love, but you are routing your reach, so to speak, throughthe wants of your personality. You are seeking external power. There is onlyemptiness there. When you seek to dominate another you dominate no one butdisempower yourself. The less empowered you feel, the more you feel a need tocontrol that which is external. The loving personality seeks not to control, butto nurture, not to dominate, but to empower. Love is the richness and fullnessof your soul flowing through you.Humbleness, forgiveness, clarity, and love are the dynamics of freedom. They arethe foundations of authentic power.1 [part0030.html#footnote-6930-15]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [part0030.html#footnote-6930-15-backlink]. To learn how to apply what you havelearned in this chapter and deepen your experiences, see the Chapter 15 StudyGuide on page 322 [part0048.html#1DOR00-ffe35c2ad53849cca826336987d3fbe4]."},{"pageContent":"Images [../images/00011.jpeg] 16 Images [../images/00011.jpeg]TRUSTEach soul comes to the Earth with gifts. A soul does not incarnate only to healand to balance its energy, to pay its karmic debts, but also to contribute itsspecialness in specific ways. Each soul brings the particular configuration ofthe Life force that it is to the needs of the Earth school. It does this withpurpose and intention.Before it incarnates, each soul agrees to perform certain tasks upon the Earth.It enters into a sacred agreement with the Universe to accomplish specificgoals. It enters into this commitment in the fullness of its being. That is whywhen a soul succeeds in accomplishing its goal, in fulfilling what it has agreedto do, there is a richness and a specialness to the lifetime of that personalitythat is recognized and honored by its fellow souls, both physical andnonphysical.Each soul takes upon itself a particular task. It may be the task of raising afamily, or communicating ideas through writing, or transforming theconsciousness of a community, such as the business community. It may be the taskof awakening the awareness of the power of love at the level of nations, or evencontributing directly to the evolution of consciousness on a global level.Whatever the task that your soul has agreed to, whatever its contract with theUniverse, all of the experiences of your life serve to awaken within you thememory of that contract, and to prepare you to fulfill it.An unempowered personality cannot complete the task of its soul. It languishesin an inner sense of emptiness. It seeks to fill itself with external power, butthat will not satisfy it. This sense of emptiness, or something missing, or ofsomething wrong, cannot be healed by satisfying the wants of the personality.Gratifying needs that are based upon fear will not bring you to the touchstoneof purpose. No matter how successful the personality becomes in accomplishingits goals, those goals will not be enough. Eventually it will hunger for theenergy of its soul. Only when the personality begins to walk the path that itssoul has chosen will it satisfy its hunger.Authentic empowerment and the fulfillment of the soul’s task upon the Earth,therefore, are not separate dynamics. Authentic empowerment is necessary toaccomplish fully the mission of the soul, yet as you move into authenticempowerment, you move toward the fulfillment of your soul’s agreement with theUniverse, and as you move toward that fulfillment—as you move consciously towardthe energy of your soul—you empower yourself. You and the work of your soul uponthe Earth expand together. As one grows and develops, so does the other.When a soul incarnates, its memory of the agreement that it has made with theUniverse becomes soft. It becomes dormant, awaiting the experiences that willactivate it. These experiences are not necessarily experiences that thepersonality would choose. They are nonetheless necessary to the activation ofthe awareness of the power and the mission of the soul within the consciousnessof the personality, and to its preparation for that task.What does it feel like to remember your soul’s task?When the deepest part of you becomes engaged in what you are doing, when youractivities and actions become gratifying and purposeful, when what you do servesboth yourself and others, when you do not tire within but seek the sweetsatisfaction of your life and your work, you are doing what you were meant to bedoing. The personality that is engaged in the work of its soul is buoyant. It isnot burdened with negativity. It does not fear. It experiences purposefulnessand meaning. It delights in its work and in others. It is fulfilled andfulfilling.Interactions with your parents, and with those whom you have chosen to shareyour intimacy, and with those with whom—out of the billions of souls upon ourplanet—you share parts of your life, serve to activate within you an awarenessof who you are and what you are here to do. The pains that you suffer, thelonelinesses that you encounter, the experiences that are disappointing ordistressing, the addictions and seeming pitfalls of your life are each doorwaysto awareness. Each offers you an opportunity to see beyond the illusion thatserves the balancing and growth of your soul.Within each experience of pain or negativity is the opportunity to challenge theperception that lies behind it, the fear that lies behind it, and to choose tolearn with wisdom. The fear will not vanish immediately, but it willdisintegrate as you work with courage. When fear ceases to scare you, it cannotstay. When you choose to learn through wisdom, to evolve consciously, your fearssurface one at a time in order for you to exorcise them with inner faith. Thatis how it happens. You exorcise your own demons.Your guides and Teachers continually offer you Light. They encourage you in eachmoment to your fullest growth and development, yet they cannot prevent you fromyour learning or your growing or your moving through your experiences andletting your experiences influence you. This is so even if you are able tocommunicate with them consciously and directly. Your experiences will move youright or left, and you will ask your Teacher this question or that. If you moveleft, your question will be entirely different than if you had moved right, andthe reality that you open by that question will be entirely different.There is no single optimal path for the soul. There are many optimal paths. Witheach choice you immediately create numerous paths within a choice, one of whichis then optimal. In other words, the optimal path of your soul is the choice ofawareness, the vertical path. Once you have made that choice, then come thevarious forms of enactment.In what way, therefore, does nonphysical guidance serve you?It is a partnership of challenging you to come to terms with the full width andbreadth and depth of authentic power and responsible choice. It is not that yougive permission to be mindlessly manipulated. It is that you give permission tobe shown the fullest of your power and guided to its use.When you depend entirely upon the ability of your personality to determine whatis best for you, you may stand in the way of a richness that is waiting for you.How do you know what the Universe has waiting for you if you take off yourrestrictions? If you are determined to have your life unfold in a particularway, and none other—if you have your heart set on using your creativity only toaccumulate money, for example—consider that you build your entire reality aroundthat. The Universe cannot help you in the same way that it can if you aretrusting of it, because it cannot overshadow nor penetrate your choice. Yet whatif what you are doing is more appropriately regarded in a social sphere ratherthan an economic one? In other words, what if the enterprise that you seek todevelop is more appropriately a way to an avenue that you have not yetrecognized? It is now deadlocked because it cannot go down its appropriate path,for you have your hand on a door that you insist upon opening that will gonowhere.Can you see?Let go of what you think is just reward. Let go. Trust. Create. Be who you are.The rest is up to your nonphysical Teachers and the Universe.Take your hands off the steering wheel. Be able to say to the Universe, “Thywill be done,” and to know it within your intentions. Spend time in thisthought. Consider what it means to say, “Thy will be done,” and allow your lifeto go into the hands of the Universe completely. The final piece of reaching forauthentic power is releasing your own to a higher form of wisdom.Long before we, as a species, became aware that there is such a dimension as therealm of nonphysical guidance and Teachers, each human being was guided, andbeautifully, by many nonphysical Teachers. Even though unseen by us, thisguidance happened nonetheless in its perfection and in its balance. That is whatis happening now. It is just that for the first time, as we become multisensory,we are aware of it, and can put names with nonphysical Teachers and have a senseof personal relationship with them, yet still it is that what you experience isalways appropriate and will always move toward the greatest wisdom of yourdevelopment and guidance.Remind yourself that you are supported, that you are not going it alone uponthis Earth. Dwell in the company of your nonphysical Teachers and guides. Do notdiscriminate in terms of what you can and should ask and speak about. Justassume and live in the beauty of the bond. Do not fear dependency. What is wrongwith being dependent upon the Universe, whether that is your Teachers or DivineIntelligence? You do what you do for yourself and the Universe and yournonphysical Teachers and guides are there in assistance. They will never do itfor you. It is not possible for them to do it for you. Delight in thedependency. Give your guides and Teachers permission to come closer.When you ask for guidance and assistance, simply assume that it immediately ispouring forward. You may need to work awhile to relax your mind intoreceptivity, or you may need to have lunch, or drive into town or do whatever itis that you need to do in order to relax your mind to hear or to feel, but livein the total assumption that the moment that you ask for guidance it is pouringin.Try looking at life as a beautifully well-organized dynamic. Trust the Universe.Trusting means that the circumstance that you are in is working toward your bestand most appropriate end. There is no when to that. There is no if to that. Itis. Release your specifications and say to the Universe: “Find me where you knowI need to be.” Let them go and trust that the Universe will provide, and so itshall. Let go of all. Let your higher self complete its task.Allow yourself to pray. Just as the many times human beings find themselves incircumstances where the hurt or the pain is so great that on their own powerthey cannot forgive, it is enough that they pray to be given the grace, theperception, the elevated Light that will allow them to forgive.It is impossible for you to come full circle in this way of empowerment withoutprayer. It is not enough to want or to intend or to meditate. You must pray. Youmust talk. You must ask. You must believe. That is partnership.Think of what you are doing as entering into partnership with DivineIntelligence, a partnership in which you begin to share your concerns with theunderstanding that there is an Intelligence receptive to what you are sayingthat helps you create within your own environment of matter and energy the mosteffective dynamics to bring you into wholeness. You do not need to think thatyou create alone, but rather that you are guided strongly in ways to helpcocreate in the most effective way for your healing and for the fulfillment ofyour contract.Consider your intentions and your meditations as part of what is done within thecontext of prayer. Be able to say within your intentions and your meditations,“And I ask for guidance or help,” and expect to get it. Expect to get it. Asidefrom your level of the responsible choice of energy and how you form that intomatter, the dependency on prayer assists you in pulling to yourself and invokinggrace. Prayer is moving into a personal relationship with Divine Intelligence.It is impossible to have a prayer without power. It is impossible to have athought that is a secret, for all energy is heard. When you pray, you draw toyou and invoke grace. Grace is uncontaminated conscious Light. It is Divinity.Prayer brings grace and grace calms you. That is the cycle. Grace is thetranquilizer of the soul. With grace comes a knowing that what you areexperiencing is necessary. It calms you with a sense of knowing.Relax into the present moment. Do what you need to do in the present moment.Yours is not to worry about that which we call the future. That does not meanthat you do not consider the consequences of each of your choices. Taking intoaccount the consequences of your decisions is responsible choice. It means tocreate strongly in the present moment. Do not lose power over the what-ifs ofyour life. These are unlimited and endless. Keep your power in the now, inpresent time. Keep your power just in the day that you are living on the Earth,and not on how to maneuver tomorrow.Use all of your worldly connections, but not out of panic and not out of fear.Do what you need to do on your end. Your choice comes in knowing appropriatetiming, clear motivation, and trust. Allow your intuition to guide your timing.Take it inside, ask how you feel, and then move forward. Allow yourself toexperience what it is to learn step by step the freedom that comes from beingunattached to the outcome, but operating from an empowered heart.Do not assume that the Universe operates like humankind, because it does not. Donot insist that the Universe comply with your understanding of it. Rather holdon to the thought that there is nothing without value that exists upon theEarth, that it is impossible to create any form of Life that does not havevalue. Therefore, it is impossible to create any action that does not havevalue. You may not see it, but that is irrelevant. Live in the trust that whenit is appropriate, pieces will fall into place and you will see clearly.Trust allows you to call forth your negativities in order to heal them. Itallows you to follow your feelings through your defenses to their sources, andto bring to the Light of consciousness those aspects of yourself that resistwholeness, that live in fear. The journey to authentic power requires that youbecome conscious of all that you feel. The unearthing and healing of yournegativities may appear to be an endless process, but it is not. Yourvulnerabilities and weaknesses and fears are not different from those of yourfellow humans. Do not despair because your humanness awakens.Feel your intentions in your heart. Feel not what your mind tells you, but whatyour heart tells you. Rather than serve the fake gods of your mind, serve yourheart, the real God. You will not find God in your intellect. DivineIntelligence is in the heart.Open yourself to your fellow humans. Allow yourself to experience what you feeltoward them, and to hear what they feel. Your interactions with them form thebasis of your growth. When you fear what you will find in yourself, or what youwill find in others, if you allow yourself to hear what others have to say, youturn your back on the opportunities that the Universe is giving you to find thepower of your heart, the power of compassion. It is not until you have thecourage to engage in human relationships that you grow.Compassion is mutual compassion. The physical body is soothed and invigorated bythe energy of the heart, and torn by lower-frequency currents of anger, rage,fear, and violence. When you treat another harshly and distance yourself fromyour heart, it is you that suffers as well as the other, and when you treatanother with compassion, you treat yourself kindly at the same time. As yourconsciousness expands, and as you become aware of what you feel, you becomeaware of the dual effects of compassion and the lack of it. You become aware ofthe damage that you do to your own body when you feel and act withoutcompassion.Challenge your fears. Fear of growing and of transformation of self is whatcauses you to want to disengage from the present situation and reach foranother. When you feel that you are in a pattern of wanting what you do not haveinstead of what you do have, of seeing the grass in the other pasture as greenerbecause it is in the other pasture, confront it. Challenge it each time that itcomes up by literally realizing that when it comes up you are not in the presentmoment, you are not engaged in your present energy dynamic but, rather, you areletting energy leak to a future that does not exist.Each time you feel negative, stop, acknowledge that you are, and discharge itconsciously. Ask what you are feeling and what is at the root of it. Go for theroot of it in that instant and, as you work to pull the root, simultaneouslylook at the positive side and remind yourself of the greater truth that there issomething spiritually profound at work, that your life is no accident, that youare under contract.Be mindful of the words that you use and the actions that you live and who youare and how it is you use your power. In other words, as you say what you say,as you make commitments, as you form the power of your life, keep clear at alltimes that you are what you say you are, that you put your force behind what yousay, and monitor that accordingly. If you are unaware of your intention, or ifyou suspect that you are operating from a second agenda, ask yourself, “What isreally going on?” Check your motivations. That automatically engages guidance.You will not be alone in your assessment.Trust allows you to give. Giving is abundant. As you give so it shall be givento you. If you give with judgment, limitation, and stinginess, that is what youwill create in your life—judgment, limitation, and stinginess. What you say toothers shall be done exactly unto you. That is the law of karma, and how youlove and serve others shall be done exactly unto you. If you radiate love andcompassion, you do receive it. If you radiate fear and suspicion and a sense ofwishing to keep people at arm’s length, then negativity comes to you becausethat is what you are asking for.Trust allows the experience of bliss. When you trust that the Universe in eachmoment is providing for the needs of your soul, and that the guidance andassistance of your nonphysical guides and Teachers are always available to you,you are free to enjoy your interactions with others and to leave aside theheavier frequencies of manipulation and protectiveness. Awakeness is a blissfulstate, not a painful one. It is blissful. It is fully balanced and lovinglyharmonious. It is all of these things and more. The vertical path means clarity,not pain.Trust allows you to laugh. You can just as easily laugh and play while you growas become serious and overwhelmed. Spiritual partners see from the perspectiveof the impersonal, and they help each other see from that perspective themeaning of their experiences. They can laugh at the richness and the beauty andthe playfulness of the Universe. They enjoy each other. They see thefrustrations of the wants of the personality for what they are, learnings,sometimes great learnings, for the soul.All of what you are doing in each day is creating what is appropriate andperfect. Apply consciousness to this process. That is trust. Although what youencounter and what you do in each moment is appropriate and perfect to theevolution of your soul, the shape of the experiences of your life is determinednonetheless by the choices that you make. It is you that chooses to linger inresentment, or to be consumed by anger, or enveloped in grief, or to releasethese lower-frequency currents of energy. Each choice that you make, to dwell innegativity or to take up residence in your heart, serves perfectly the evolutionof your soul. All roads lead to home.If you choose anger, or grief, or resentment, or jealousy you will learn thelesson of love, but you will learn it through pain and trauma and a sense ofloss. You will not evolve. This is not possible. You are on a quest forauthentic power. You cannot give up this quest. Your only choice is whether youwish to have the quest consciously or unconsciously. You can choose through yourresponses to life’s difficulties to engage the full power of your soul. This isthe conscious path to authentic empowerment.If you will eventually evolve beyond the Earth school, beyond the need for apersonality and a body and the illusion in which fear and anger and insecurityappear to exist, why should you choose the vertical path?This is for you to decide. The path that you now walk is not unknown to theUniverse. The pains and distresses and violences that you experience can beconsidered as signposts along the path that you have chosen. If you have chosenthe path of learning through jealousy, for example, you will experience anxietyand fear of loss of what you think you cannot live without because theseexperiences are part of the path of learning through jealousy. They might bethought of as what that road looks like between mile twenty and mile thirty. Ifyou choose the path of learning through anger, you will experience rejection andviolence; if you choose the path of love, you will experience being loved byothers, and so on, because the choice of a particular path is also the choice ofparticular types of experiences. You do not break new ground from the point ofview of the Universe.Whether you continue the quest for external power, which now leads nowhere, ordecide to build within yourself authentic power and align yourself with theevolutionary path that our species is now on determines the experiences that youwill contribute to the evolution of your soul and to the soul of humankind. Youcontribute appropriately and perfectly to your evolution and to the evolution ofothers no matter what you choose. This is true. Yet why choose to learnunconsciously? Have you gained the sense of security and contentment andfulfillment that you seek in this way?What is it that you wish to contribute and to experience as our species, and aseach of us individually, makes the evolutionary transition from the five-sensoryperception of the Universe to the multisensory, from evolution through thefive-sensory exploration of physical reality to evolution through responsiblechoice with the guidance and assistance of nonphysical guides and Teachers? Areyou comfortable with the thought that the Universe is alien and dead and no morethan your five senses can detect? How does your heart respond to the thoughtthat the Universe is alive and compassionate and that with it and with othersouls of great power and Light you learn through the process of cocreating thereality that you experience?Look at the probable futures that are unfolding before our world that is builtupon the energy of the personality, and the probable futures that would unfoldbefore a world that is built upon the energy of the soul. Which do you choose?Allow yourself to become aware of what you feel. Give yourself permission tochoose the most positive behavior in each moment. As you discharge negativeenergy consciously and set your intentions according to what your heart tellsyou, as you challenge and release your fears and choose to heal, you align yourpersonality with your soul and move toward becoming a being of the Light, fullywhole and empowered and inwardly secure. Humbleness, forgiveness, clarity andlove, all the gifts of the spirit, take root and bloom, and you draw to yourselfthe Universe’s greatest gift: human beings with open hearts.Rather than a soul in a body, become a body in a soul. Reach for your soul.Reach even farther. The impulse of creation and power authentic—the hourglasspoint between energy and matter: that is the seat of the soul. What does it meanto touch that place?It is exciting to come of age spiritually.1 [part0031.html#footnote-6930-16]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [part0031.html#footnote-6930-16-backlink]. To learn how to apply what you havelearned in this chapter and deepen your experiences, see the chapter 16 StudyGuide on page 327 [part0049.html#1ENBI0-ffe35c2ad53849cca826336987d3fbe4]."},{"pageContent":"AN INVITATIONDear Friend,If you are interested in creating authentic power and spiritual partnerships inyour life, I invite you to join me at SeatoftheSoul.com[http://SeatoftheSoul.com].

The people in your groupare your potential spiritual partners. Eventually, new perceptions and valueswill bring you naturally into constructive cocreation with others. Although noone can do the work of your own evolution for you, the day of the lone wolf, thesolitary monk, the hermit seeking enlightenment in isolation is over. Untilrecently our evolution has unfolded very slowly. Now it is happening atlightning speed. Within a few generations, all humans will experience theexpanded perception that is emerging in millions of us. This Study Guide willhelp you not only to recognize this expanded perception in yourself but also touse it consciously to bring its amazing new potential—authentic power—into yourown life.An expanded version of this Study Guide, including videos and meditations, isavailable to you online by tapping www.seatofthesoul.com/sg[http://www.seatofthesoul.com/sg] if you are reading an eBook or by typing itinto a browser if you are reading a print book.

This birth is parteffortless and part challenging. The emergence of multisensoryperception—perception beyond what can be seen, heard, tasted, touched, andsmelled—is effortless. It is happening whether or not we ask for it. Some peopleeven resist it because they do not want to see what they see. Multisensoryperception brings with it a new potential. This is the potential of authenticpower. Authentic power is the alignment of the personality with the soul. Thisnew potential does not automatically come into being. Each of us must create itfor ourselves. Creating authentic power requires experiencing within us thedifferences between fear and love and choosing love no matter what is going oninside us—such as anger, jealousy, or resentment—or what is going on outsideus—such as another 9/11 attack, an illness, or the death of a child. This is thechallenging part. The Seat of the Soul shows you what authentic power is, why itis important, and how to create it.Images [../images/00011.jpeg] EVOLUTION Images [../images/00011.jpeg]When the physical environment is seen only from the five-sensory point of view,physical survival appears to be the fundamental criterion of evolution, and thebasis of life in the physical arena becomes fear. Power to control theenvironment and those within it appears to be essential. This produces a type ofcompetition that affects every aspect of our lives. Power over what can be felt,smelled, tasted, heard, or seen is external power. All perceptions of lesser andgreater personal value result from the perception of power as external.Competition for external power lies at the heart of all violence. Our deeperunderstanding leads us to another kind of power that loves Life in every form,does not judge, and perceives meaningfulness and purpose in the smallest detailsupon the Earth. This is authentic power. Authentic power has its roots in thedeepest source of our being. It cannot be bought, inherited, or hoarded. We areevolving from a species that pursues external power into a species that pursuesauthentic power. No understanding of evolution is adequate that does not have atits core that we are on a journey toward authentic power, and that authenticempowerment is the goal of our evolutionary process and the purpose of ourbeing.If you are reading an eBook, click the following link to go to an expandedonline version of this Chapter Study Guide, including video, meditation, andsupport for study groups.

Open to answers that come to you, andwhen more thoughts come to you, open yourself to them, also. There are no rightor wrong answers. These questions are designed to help you explore yourself andyour experiences. Sometimes answers will continue to come to you. Let thathappen. If you are in a group, share your answers, and then continue to askthese questions to yourself after you leave the group. Write your answers downso that you will remember them. They will stimulate even more questions andanswers in you when you read them in the future.1. Do you think that a loving person is more evolved than a mean-spiritedperson? Why?2. Have you ever had a multisensory experience, or do you think you might havehad one?3. Do you ever feel, or suspect, that you have gifts to give, and you want toknow what they are?4. What makes a powerful person powerful? Who affects your life mostpowerfully—people who intimidate you or people who sincerely care for you?5. Write down several examples of external power. Have you had an experience orexperiences of authentic power? Write them down.6. Have you ever felt that you are more than you thought you were—for example,more than a mind and a body?EXERCISEAM I MULTISENSORY?Make a list of the ways you can identify that you are multisensory. For example:• I know inside what decision I need to make.• I have hunches.• I value my insights.• I use my intuition.• Sometimes I know more than I can see.(from The Mind of the Soul by Gary Zukav and Linda Francis)LIFE LESSONSYou may be surprised at how much multisensory perception is already a part ofyour life. The goal is to recognize it, honor it, and experiment with it.Experiences of multisensory perception may be more natural to you than youexpect. Multisensory perception is your ability to see beyond what the fivesenses can detect.Set your intention every day for the next week to find meaning for youpersonally in your everyday experiences. Open yourself to seeing meaning thatyou did not see before and recognizing your insights as valuable experiences ofmultisensory perception. Take notes and journal every night about what you haveseen from your multisensory perception.At the end of the week write down your answers to these questions:• What was your most meaningful example of multisensory perception? What did youlearn from this experience?• How did your intention to find meaning in your everyday life affect yourexperiences? Be specific.• How did what you discovered affect your perspective of yourself and others?Give examples.Now take another week and set the same intention every day. Take notes andjournal every night about what you have seen from your multisensory perspective.At the end of this time write your answers to these questions:• What did you discover about yourself by opening to your multisensoryperception? Be specific.• What was the first multisensory experience in your life that you recognized asa multisensory experience?• What is the most meaningful example of a multisensory experience in your life?HELPFUL DIAGRAMImages [../images/00016.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":"Images [../images/00011.jpeg] CHAPTER 2 Images [../images/00011.jpeg]This chapter is about your intellect and your five senses. They are related.Your five senses provide your intellect information—what you see, hear, taste,touch, and smell. Your intellect compares and analyzes this information, deducesand concludes things about it, and tells you how to stay alive and comfortable.It cannot comprehend information that does not come from your five senses. Thatis the kind of information that multisensory perception provides you. Itliterally “makes no sense” to your intellect. We call this information“illogical” or “non-sense,” for example, experiences of other personalities ofyour soul that live in different times and different places, such as the past,from the perspective of your personality. Yet it is precisely this kind ofinformation that is now necessary for us to create healthy, empowered, andconstructive lives. The intellect cannot even imagine this new circumstance.This chapter is about exactly this circumstance. In the East it is called karma,and in the West it is called the Golden Rule.Images [../images/00011.jpeg] KARMA Images [../images/00011.jpeg]Creating authentic power requires that you become responsible for everythingthat you create. The Universal Law of Cause and Effect shows you how you alreadyare responsible for everything that you create, and knowledge of it gives you astrong incentive to create healthy and constructive experiences with yourchoices. This is the law of karma: What you cause another to experience, you oranother personality of your soul will experience also. Conversely, what anotherpersonality of your soul causes in the experience of another, you may experiencealso. Karma is the impersonal Universal teacher of responsibility. When youunderstand that your experiences are karmic necessities, you are less likely totake them personally—to react with anger, righteous outrage, judgment, etc.(Remember: Judge not lest you be judged.) This means that you also will createfewer painful experiences and more joyful experiences for yourself and otherpersonalities of your soul. When you choose wisely and responsibly while you areangry, judgmental, etc., you enter into the evolution of your soul consciously(and you create authentic power).If you are reading an eBook, click the following link to go to an expandedonline version of this Chapter Study Guide, including video, meditation, andsupport for study groups. If you are reading a print copy, type it into yourbrowser: www.seatofthesoul.com/sg2 [http://www.seatofthesoul.com/sg2].QUESTIONSHere are more questions to ask yourself. If you feel reactions to any of them(such as becoming judgmental, dismissive, appreciative, amazed, validated), makea note of these reactions. If you are in a group, share your answers and listenwith openness to the experiences of fellow souls who share with you. Write youranswers down so that you will remember them. You may discover that some of themchange over time.1. How many times this last week did you feel angry, resentful, betrayed,superior, inferior, etc., and acted on that emotion?2. Have you ever asked yourself, Why me? What did I do to deserve this? Writedown some examples.3. How many times have you felt hurt and wanted to hurt the person you felt wasresponsible?4. Would you have acted the same way if you knew that the cause of your hurt mayhave occurred centuries before you were born?5. How do you feel about the possibility of consciously creating blissfulexperiences for yourself and for other personalities of your soul? Imagine howyou could do this. Write all that comes to you and go back to it frequently.Choose what experiences you intend to bring into your life.EXERCISESA WEEK OF KINDNESSGo out of your way to see how you can be friendly and kind to people that youencounter during this week. Extend this kindness to people you talk to on thephone, email, or write. Then notice how you feel and what effects you notice inyour life. Share your experiences with others, and if they are not also doingthis exercise, invite them to join you and to share their experiences as youshare yours.(From The Mind of the Soul by Gary Zukav and Linda Francis)EXPLORING THE GOLDEN RULERemember a time when something happened to you that you were surprised anddelighted about, for example, an unexpected gift or kindness.Ask yourself, “Have I ever surprised and delighted others in a similar way?”Remember when something happened and you were shocked and hurt, for example,when you were betrayed or someone raged at you.Ask yourself, “Have I ever shocked and hurt others in a similar way?”Have you ever considered that the things you are experiencing, joyful orpainful, are consequences of choices you have made or that another personalityof your soul has made?Pondering these questions will stimulate deeper connections and conversationswith the people in your life.(From The Mind of the Soul by Gary Zukav and Linda Francis)A KARMIC EXPERIENCE?Recall a time when you were aware that you were or might be having a karmicexperience . . . an experience that you felt or sensed had to do with karma thatyou created or that had been created by another personality of your soul. Howdid it impact your life? It may be that you sensed that there was more to thisexperience . . . more happening than you could articulate.Explore this by yourself and/or with others. Ask your intuition how knowing thiscan support you in your spiritual growth.If you have not had such an experience, imagine what one would feel like to you."},{"pageContent":"Images [../images/00011.jpeg] CHAPTER 3 Images [../images/00011.jpeg]In the past, reverence meant putting something, such as Divinity, or someone,such as a saint, above and beyond human experience. Now we can sense ourselvesand others in ways that we cannot detect with our eyes, ears, nose, taste, andtouch. We do not confuse the things that our five senses tell us about a person,such as her sex, skin color, or nationality, with her essence. Five-sensoryhumans do not mistake the clothes that an individual is wearing—for example, abusiness suit, evening gown, or work jeans—with the individual that is wearingthem. In the same way, multisensory humans do not mistake an Earth suit, such asa white, American artist or a yellow, Thai nun or a black, African teacher withthe soul that is wearing it. Multisensory humans also sense oceans, forests,deserts, and mountains in ways that five-sensory humans cannot. Connecting withthe essence of a person or thing is a multisensory experience. This isreverence. Reverence is different from respect. You can respect one personwithout respecting another person, but you cannot revere one person withoutrevering everyone.Images [../images/00011.jpeg] REVERENCE Images [../images/00011.jpeg]Reverence is seeing beyond the outer shell of appearance to the essence withinit. Reverence is connecting with the true power and essence of what a person isor what a thing is. It is a holy perception. It is recognizing personalities asEarth suits and shifting your attention away from the Earth suit to what iswearing it. That is the soul. Reverence is accepting that all Life is, in and ofitself, sacred. Without reverence we become cruel and destructive and createpainful karma for ourselves. A reverent person automatically avoids the severekarmic consequences that are created by acting without reverence, and eachreverent action is a step toward aligning itself with its soul. The soul reveresall of Life. A reverent person sees and honors Divinity in all its forms. Livingwith reverence requires challenging the values and perceptions of a five-sensoryworld that does not value Life. Becoming reverent is essentially becoming aspiritual person.If you are reading an eBook, click the following link to go to an expandedonline version of this Chapter Study Guide, including video, meditation, andsupport for study groups. If you are reading a print copy, type it into yourbrowser: www.seatofthesoul.com/sg3 [http://www.seatofthesoul.com/sg3].QUESTIONSUse these questions to bring your attention to experiences of reverence. Allowthem to stimulate new perceptions and insights in you.1. How often do you judge the people around you because of their skin color,appearance, clothing, beliefs, actions, and possessions? (Sometimes thisquestion is difficult to answer because the parts of your personality that judgeothers are so familiar to you that their judgments don’t seem like judgments.They seem like the way things actually are. So take at least a day to observehow often you judge others or yourself and write down your judgments asyou notice them.)2. Do you notice when you think people are judging you for the same reasons?Write and/or share your observations.3. Can people earn your reverence, like they can earn your respect? Notice whatyou feel when you feel reverence and what you feel when you have respect forothers. Write what you notice and share it with others, if possible.4. Do you see Divinity in all forms of Life?5. Would you like to? Spend a day or two seeing if you can sense Divinitywherever you look.EXERCISECAN YOU SEE DIFFERENTLY?(If you are with others, one person read this exercise while the others closetheir eyes.)• Recall a person whom you have known for a long time but you don’t feel closeto and you would like to. Do you feel inferior to or jealous of your friend? Orperhaps superior and judgmental? Why do you feel distant from this person?• Have you been looking only at your friend’s Earth suit?• Have you been focusing on what he does or how he dresses?• Do you feel you are not able to communicate because of a misunderstanding or afight you had?• Are you distant because your life has taken you in a different direction?Now open yourself to the possibility of seeing your friend differently. Set yourintention to see beyond the appearances of your friend’s Earth suit. Spend atleast fifteen minutes on this exercise.Picture your friend. Remind yourself that you don’t know all that goes into thelife of your friend . . . his challenges, his fears, his joys, his terror.Remember that you are a soul and so is your friend.If your eyes were closed, open them and notice how you feel about your friendnow. Do you feel compassion? If not, continue to do this exercise over and overuntil you feel a shift from contraction to openness, from seeing your friendonly as a personality to knowing that your friend is a soul wearing an Earthsuit. Allow yourself to feel the instant that your fear, judgment, and disdaindisappear and reverence appears. Do this daily for as long as you like andchoose different people in your life that you would like to change yourperspective on from judgmental to reverent.(From The Mind of the Soul by Gary Zukav and Linda Francis)LIFE LESSONSet the intention this week to see with reverence everyone and everything,including your relationships with people who are close to you, acquaintances,people you meet in passing, people you feel a distance from, etc. Set thisintention each morning and every time you remember during the day.At the end of the week write your answers to these questions:• What did looking at everything with reverence during the last week help you torealize? Give examples.• What did you create by holding this intention? Be specific.EXERCISES AND QUESTIONSUse these questions to help you explore reverence:1 Your soul reveres Life in all of its forms, including you. Do you revere you?2. What would it mean to revere yourself?3. Would revering yourself be narcissistic? Some fear-based parts of yourpersonality may feel narcissistic. It is important to become aware of them sothat you can tell the difference between narcissism and revering yourself. Writeand/or share about your discoveries.4. What would it mean to revere someone else?5. If reverence is recognizing the essence of a person or thing, how could yourevere the essence of someone else and not revere your essence?6. If you revered all things, how would your life be different?"},{"pageContent":"Images [../images/00011.jpeg] CHAPTER 4 Images [../images/00011.jpeg]Your emotions are very important. You cannot grow spiritually without becomingaware of them. This turns the view of emotions that most of us hold upside down.We think that emotions serve no useful purpose. Like an appendix, they can bevery painful, and nothing is lost by having an appendix removed. A wonderfultreasure is lost when you are removed from your emotions. Your emotions aremessages from your soul that bring you priceless information. If you do notreceive the information, it is delivered again and again. Not only pleasing andblissful emotions bring you important information. Painful emotions, includingthe most unbearable, bring you important information, too. In other words, thepath to spiritual growth leads through your heart.Only through your emotions can you experience the force field of your own soul.Your emotions tell you what parts of your personality are loving and createjoyful consequences when you act on them and what parts are fearful and createpainful consequences when you act on them. As you become spiritual, you becomeheart-centered. Many people feel that “heart-centered” means mushy andsentimental, but that is actually the opposite of heart-centered. Becomingheart-centered means choosing to act from loving parts of your personalityinstead of frightened parts of your personality. In other words, moving frombeing unconsciously controlled by fearful emotions to consciously choosing toact on loved-based emotions. Once you can do this, you are in a position tochange your life, your future, and your world.Images [../images/00011.jpeg] HEART Images [../images/00011.jpeg]The logics that enabled us to evolve as a five-sensory species cannotmeaningfully represent the existence of the soul, evolution without time, or thenonphysical dynamic of karma that generates and links many lifetimes. Therefore,the time has come for a higher order of logic and understanding. The creation ofthis higher order of logic and understanding requires close attention tofeelings, and this requires the heart. Your emotions show you which parts ofyour personality are aligned with your soul and which parts are not. Withoutawareness of your emotions, you cannot see the dynamics that lie behind youremotions or the ends that these dynamics serve. Only a compassionate heart canengage evil directly. Evil is an absence of Light, Divinity, DivineIntelligence. The remedy for an absence is a presence. Only the heart can bringLight where there was none. Therefore, only the heart can engage evil directly.Understanding evil as the absence of Light enables you to see that the onlyplace to begin the process of eliminating evil is within yourself.If you are reading an eBook, click the following link to go to an expandedonline version of this Chapter Study Guide, including video, meditation, andsupport for study groups. If you are reading a print copy, type it into yourbrowser: www.seatofthesoul.com/sg4 [http://www.seatofthesoul.com/sg4].QUESTIONSBecoming aware of your emotions and using them to create authentic power doesnot mean ceasing to use your intellect. On the contrary, you use it more andmore consciously, which means more and more in the service of the heart—in theservice of love—instead of unconsciously in the service of fear.1. Have you ever thought of your emotions as serving a purpose beyond fight orflight survival? What emotions do you encounter in yourself that you feel arebased in fear? What emotions do you experience in yourself that you feel comefrom love?2. What does the “higher order of logic and understanding of the heart” mean toyou? Write down your thoughts so that you can refer to them later.3. Have you ever considered evil as an absence of love? What would this mean foryou if it were true? Write about this and share from your heart with others whoare open.4. Have you ever considered the idea that the place to begin eliminating evil inthe world is within you? Write the ideas and insights that come to you as youponder this idea. If it were true, in what ways would you eliminate evil in you?EXERCISESCHOOSE YOUR INTENTIONS WITH YOUR HEARTFor the next day or the next week, ask yourself, “Why do I really want to do orsay this?” before you choose what you do or say.• Is it to create harmony?• Am I doing or saying what feels good in my heart?• Am I doing or saying what my mind is telling me?Write your answers in your journal.Once you have done this for yourself, ask others to join you in this exerciseand share about it.(From The Mind of the Soul by Gary Zukav and Linda Francis)OPEN YOUR HEARTPractice opening your heart by thinking of a time when you felt love andopenness for someone—for your child, grandchild, partner, friend, or in aspecial encounter with a stranger. Recall the situation and what you werefeeling in the area of your heart.The next time you feel your heart is closed (your chest hurts), let yourselfexperience the pain in your chest, breathe deeply, even if you feelconstriction, and, at the same time, remember that special time. Keep openingyour heart and breathing deeply until you feel yourself begin to relax, even ifonly a little. Ask your intuition for guidance in opening your heart.Do this practice to challenge the fear-based part of your personality that isclosing your heart to yourself and others.(From The Heart of the Soul by Gary Zukav and Linda Francis)HELPFUL THOUGHTWhen an intention comes from your heart, it brings the energy of your heart intoyour action and creates experiences for you. When your intention is not fromyour heart, it brings fear into your action and creates your experiences. Youmust be aware of what you are feeling and thinking in order to recognize thedifferences. Your heart is open, accepting, creative, and grounded. It feelsgood and relaxes you. Fear is impatient, righteous, closed, and defensive. Ithurts and cannot tolerate differences. Your heart includes. Fear excludes. Yourheart keeps you in touch with the whole. The whole is Life. Without your heartto illuminate your travels, they become frightening experiences.Here is a mini-checklist to use to remind you if your heart is open or closed:CLOSED HEARTOPEN HEARTSentimentalClear and GroundedExclusiveInclusive"},{"pageContent":"Images [../images/00011.jpeg] CHAPTER 5 Images [../images/00011.jpeg]It is as easy to call upon intuition as it is to ask yourself a question. Inparticular, questions such as “Why am I so upset about this situation?”, “Whydoes this interaction affect me in this way?”, and “What can I learn aboutmyself from this experience?” always invoke guidance, and guidance always comes.How does this happen? Your intellect and five senses cannot explain intuition orshow it to you, but you can experience intuition for yourself. It is your sourceof insights that help you stay in the Earth school, express your creativity, andinspire you. It allows you to benefit from compassion and wisdom that aregreater than we can give to others and receive from others. Intuition is thefountain of personal truths and impersonal truths. It is natural for us to wantto access intuition and enjoy it. Five-sensory humans do not think intuition isworthy of serious study. Sometimes multisensory humans think they are superiorbecause they have intuitive abilities and so they use intuition with a closedheart. However, multisensory humans who are creating authentic power depend uponit. For them, intuition is the primary decision-making faculty.Images [../images/00011.jpeg] INTUITION Images [../images/00011.jpeg]Intuition is perception beyond the physical senses that is meant to assist you.It is what makes multisensory perception multisensory. Multisensory humans arein conscious communication with advanced intelligences. They have access tocompassionate and impersonal help. Multisensory humans see insights, intuitions,hunches, and inspirations as promptings from, and links to, a perspective ofgreater comprehension and compassion than their own. They use this guidance tohelp them create authentic power. Your higher self is the aspect of your soulwithin you. Communicating with your soul through your higher self producespersonal truth—truth that mostly is effective only for you. This is an in-houseintuitive process. Communicating through your higher self with souls in advanceof your own soul produces impersonal truth—truth that is true for anyone whocomes into contact with it. This is receiving information through intuitivechannels. Multisensory personalities rely upon truths they receive from theirhigher selves and, through their higher selves, from their own souls and soulsthat are more advanced than their own.If you are reading an eBook, click the following link to go to an expandedonline version of this Chapter Study Guide, including video, meditation, andsupport for study groups.

If you are in a group, share your answers with your spiritualpartners and open to learning about yourself from what they share with you.1. Have you ever had sudden or surprising insights? Have you acted on theseinsights? What significant things happened because you acted, or if you didn’tact, what do you feel prevented you?2. Have you ever been suddenly inspired by an idea, project, or possibility thatwas very meaningful to you, or became very meaningful?3. Have you ever found yourself feeling compassion for someone who wronged youor others, even though you still do not like or approve of what he or she did?4. Have you ever had the thought that you have assistance or help that youcannot see, but that you can feel is present with you?5. Do the ideas that you are not alone and that you can access loving guidancethrough your intuition appeal to you?EXERCISEA DAILY PRACTICE FOR CONSULTING INTUITIONAnytime you react to anything . . .• I feel overwhelmed (too busy, don’t have enough time, etc.)• I am sad (depressed, manic, impatient, etc.)• I lost my job (hate my boss, etc.)• He or she disappointed me (betrayed me, cheated on me, etc.)• I feel inferior (invisible, unworthy, etc.)• I am upset because my car broke down (flight got canceled, etc.)• I feel entitled (superior, better than, etc.)Ask yourself:What can I learn about myself from this reaction?How can I move beyond the control of this part of my personality that isreacting now?How can I change my perspective from frightened to loving?Listen for the answer.It will come.LIFE LESSONEach morning this week set your intention to open to the support of intuition,support that is always there for you. Ask yourself questions that you wantsupport with. Then listen for answers. They may come immediately or they maycome later, but they will come.Some examples of questions you might ask are:• How can I relate better with my son or daughter?• How can I become aware of frightened parts of my personality sooner?• How can I take responsibility sooner when I realize that I am in a powerstruggle?• How can I best complete the project that I am confused about?• How can I heal the frightened part of the personality that feels financiallyinadequate?• What is the best way that I can speak with my mother-in-law (child, spouse,boss, boyfriend, neighbor, etc.)?• What can I learn from my experiences of overwhelm, anger, jealousy,overeating, etc.?Write your questions down. Ponder them. Open yourself to answers. Notice theways that intuitive understanding, or insight, comes to you, and open yourselfto other ways as well. Listen to what you are saying when you speak and to whatothers are saying. Remember your dreams and meditate on them.At the end of the week write down your answers to these questions:• Do you feel that this Life Lesson helped you to further develop your abilityto use intuition? If so, share how. If not, ask your intuition how you candevelop your ability to use intuition. Be patient. Your answer will come.• What questions did you ask your intuition? What answers did you get? How didthat support you?• Write down the most significant thing you learned about yourself and yourintuitive ability this week.• Share this with someone who wants to open to their own intuitive guidance.LIFE LESSONDevote two days this week to following your intuition. If you cannot spend thewhole day, find periods of time during a day or several days. Schedule it (makeappointments between you and your intuition).Write your experiences throughout the day, and at the end of the day answerthese questions in your journal:• When did you follow your intuition? When did you resist? Be specific.• Did your intuition surprise you?• What did you discover about yourself by following your intuition?• What were the most significant things you experienced experimenting with yourintuition?"},{"pageContent":"Images [../images/00011.jpeg] CHAPTER 6 Images [../images/00011.jpeg]Most people think of themselves and others as made of “stuff,” such as muscles,neurons, organs, a brain, hands, and feet. This thought is a product offive-sensory perception, which can detect only what we can see, hear, touch,taste, and smell. The perception of our species is expanding from one range offrequencies in the spectrum of nonphysical Light into another range of higherfrequencies. This is the emergence of multisensory perception. As we becomemultisensory, we are discovering that we and everything else are made of Light.Light, Consciousness, Love, Life, and Divine Intelligence are all words for thesame thing, and we are that. Most of you exists in nonphysical reality, andtherefore most of your interactions occur in nonphysical reality. Your influenceextends far beyond the domain of the five senses, and it is instantaneous.Consequences of choices that you make and the emotions that you feel affectothers wherever they are. Energies that emanate from your personality—itsfears—follow the path of physical light. They are not instantaneous. Theunconditional Love of your soul is instantaneous, Universal, not bound. As youalign your personality with your soul, you bring the unconditional Love of yoursoul into the Earth school.Images [../images/00011.jpeg] LIGHT Images [../images/00011.jpeg]You are a system of Light. The frequency of your Light depends upon yourconsciousness. When you shift your consciousness, you shift the frequency ofyour Light. Emotions are currents of energy with different frequencies. Thoughtssuch as vengeance, violence, greed, and using others create low-frequencycurrents of energy, such as anger, hatred, jealousy, and fear. Loving, creative,and caring thoughts create high-frequency currents of energy, such asappreciation, forgiveness, and gratitude. Your choice of thoughts determineswhich emotional currents you will reinforce or release. Changing your thoughtschanges the quality of your Light, the nature of your experiences, and youreffects on others. We are evolving into a higher range of frequencies of Light,which means that we are becoming multisensory. We are becoming aware of theLight of our souls and able to communicate with forms of Life that wereinvisible to us, such as nonphysical Teachers. Nonphysical Teachers assist yoursoul in every phase of its evolution, but they cannot make your decisions foryou or change your karma.If you are reading an eBook, click the following link to go to an expandedonline version of this Chapter Study Guide, including video, meditation, andsupport for study groups.

If you are studying alone, read this exercise and then go through itas well as you can. You may be surprised by how much and how accurately youremember it.Recall a time when you felt a strong emotion, such as anger, jealousy, orresentment. Close your eyes and go back to that time.Take a few minutes to feel what this emotion felt like then and still feels likenow in your body. Where did/do you feel the physical sensations of it? Forexample, in your chest, stomach, pelvis, neck, throat?Recall the thoughts you were having when you experienced this emotion. Forexample, if you were angry, were you blaming yourself or someone else, or asituation?How did you behave?Recall what you said when you experienced this emotion. For example, if you wereresentful, did you say something hurtful?What would you have done differently?What can you learn about yourself from this experience now that you were notable to learn at the time?My friend Maya Angelou says, “When you know better, you do better.”HELPFUL THOUGHTSMy emotions come from my energy-processing systemNotFrom my interactions with people or things.Each emotion is a message for me.It is a message from my soul.I ignore these messages when IAct them outByBlaming myself, others, or the Universe.If I do not accept these messagesThey come back until I do.EXERCISEYOUR SPIRITUAL TUTORImagine that your emotions are being sent to you by your spiritual tutor. Thosethat come with painful physical sensations are showing you what lower-frequencycurrents of light feel like in your body so that you can avoid creatingdestructive consequences for yourself by acting on them. Those that come withgood-feeling physical sensations are showing you what higher-frequency currentsof light feel like in your body so that you can create constructive consequencesfor yourself by acting on them.

The physical law of cause and effect governsphysical causes and physical effects, such as launching a rocket and landing iton the moon. The Universal Law of Cause and Effect governs the creation ofphysical and nonphysical effects by nonphysical causes. If you are not aware ofthe Universal Law of Cause and Effect and how it works, you will create, as youcontinually do, but you will not create what you want. Your intentions are thenonphysical causes that create your experiences. This is one of the mostimportant things in your life to remember. You can experiment to see if it istrue. Experimenting with your life frees you to create differently. It requiresbecoming aware moment to moment of your intentions and then looking forconnections between them and the experiences that you encounter. The more awareyou become of your intentions, and the more aware you become of yourexperiences, the more connections you will see between them, and the more youwill be able to consciously choose the experiences of your life that you want.This is the development of mastery. It is the creation of authentic power.Images [../images/00011.jpeg] INTENTION I Images [../images/00011.jpeg]There is Light, and there is the shaping of Light by consciousness. This iscreation. You are a dynamic being of Light that informs the Light flowingthrough you with each intention. An intention is the reason for acting. It isthe use of your will. Intentions set into motion processes that affect everyaspect of your life. Physical reality and everything in it are systems of Lightwithin systems of Light, and this Light is the same Light as the Light of yoursoul. Physical matter is the densest level of Light. We are evolving into aspecies of individuals who are aware of themselves as beings of Light and shapetheir Light consciously with wisdom and compassion. You create your reality withyour intentions. It is a multilayered creation—personal, family, work/school,people in your life, town/city, state/area, culture, nation, race, sex, soul ofhumanity. No individuals have the same reality. As you move outward through thelayers of your reality, they become increasingly impersonal. The shared physicalreality of the Earth school is a fluid massive consciousness in which eachindividual exists independently and also coexists interdependently with others.If you are reading an eBook, click the following link to go to an expandedonline version of this Chapter Study Guide, including video, meditation, andsupport for study groups.

Can you think of anyone except you who can know your intention at the momentthat you speak or act?5. How does the idea that you and every physical form are the same Light as theLight of your soul make you feel?EXERCISESTHE FUNDAMENTAL PRACTICEBefore you do anything that you are not sure of your motivation for doing, askyourself:“What is my intention for doing this?”And wait for an answer.Do this for several days and see how your experiences change. Write what youdiscover. Do this as a practice daily if you find it is supporting you.(From The Mind of the Soul by Gary Zukav and Linda Francis)LIFE LESSONSFor the next week or more, ask yourself, “What is my intention?” every time youreact. For example, if you are impatient, defensive, angry, or in a powerstruggle, stop and ask yourself in that moment, “What is my intention?” Not theintention you think you have set for yourself, but the real intention that liesbehind your impatience, defensiveness, anger, or the power struggle.Feel the physical sensations in your body in the vicinities of yourenergy-processing centers and, while you are feeling them, decide what you willsay or do next. Ask yourself, “What would be the healthiest choice for me rightnow?”Carry a notebook in your purse or pocket and write your discoveries.If you are studying with a group, share with your spiritual partners what youare learning about intention or questions you have about it.After the first week, write your answers to these questions in your journal:• What have you discovered so far?• What were some of the healthy choices you made instead of acting from afrightened part of your personality?• What did you discover about your intentions when you were in a reaction andyou stopped to ask, “What is my intention?” Give some specific examples.• What was your most common way to react? In other words, what frightened partof your personality became active most frequently?• If you are studying with others, what did you learn from sharing with yourspiritual partners?During the second week consider the choices you have made so far and see if youcan distinguish between your surface intention or intentions (for example, aphysical goal) and your deeper intention (why you are going to do what you aregoing to do). Don’t forget to continue to ask yourself, “What is my intention?”each time you are about to react, and then, ask yourself instead, “What would bethe healthiest choice for me right now?”If you are in a group, continue to share what you are learning about intentionor your questions about it.After the second week write your answers to these questions in your journal:• Were you able to distinguish between your surface intention or intentions andyour deepest, bedrock intentions? Give examples.• What was the most significant thing you discovered this week about intentionsand yourself?• What did you learn about your intentions from your interactions with others?"},{"pageContent":"Images [../images/00011.jpeg] CHAPTER 8 Images [../images/00011.jpeg]Your choice of intention creates your experiences. When you encounter theexperiences that your choice has created, you must again choose an intention.This process continues until your soul leaves the Earth school. While you choosethe same intentions, you create the same consequences. This is called karma inthe East and the Golden Rule in the West. When you choose different intentions,you create different karma. By choosing intentions that come from love insteadof intentions that come from fear, you create joyful karma instead of painfulkarma. Karma teaches you responsibility for the intentions that you choose, andyou learn this lesson at your own pace. How long will you continue to createpainful experiences for yourself? That depends on how long you continue tochoose intentions of fear. The choice is yours, and the intention behind each ofyour choices creates more experiences for you. Each word that you speak carriesintelligence, and therefore is an intention that shapes Light. When you chooseto align yourself with your soul instead of with your personality, you create areality that reflects your soul rather than your personality. You create “heavenon Earth” when you choose to respond to life’s difficulties with intentions oflove instead of intentions of fear.Images [../images/00011.jpeg] INTENTION II Images [../images/00011.jpeg]What is not learned in a lifetime is carried over into other lifetimes alongwith new lessons that arise for the soul to learn. This is how the soul evolves.The karma of the soul determines the characteristics of the personality atbirth, including its intentions. There are two fundamental intentions: love andfear. The intentions of the personality at birth shape the Light that is flowingthrough it into the reality that is optimal for the evolution of its soul. Thereactions of the personality to the consequences of its intentions becomeadditional karma for the soul. This continues until its intentions are changed.That requires consciousness. The introduction of consciousness into the cyclicprocess of creation allows you to change your intentions from fear to love,change your karma, and infuse physical matter with the consciousness of thesacred. Spiritual partnership is partnership between equals for the purpose ofcreating authentic power. Spiritual partners are aware of their souls, and theyare committed to bringing the consciousness of their souls into theirintention-setting processes and assisting one another in doing that.If you are reading an eBook, click the following link to go to an expandedonline version of this Chapter Study Guide, including video, meditation, andsupport for study groups.

In general, are theypeople who:• Please others so they feel better themselves?• Gossip?• Love life?• Trust the Universe?• Don’t understand why things happen to them?• Want revenge?• Are angry and don’t shout?• Give freely?LIFE LESSONThis Life Lesson is about hidden agendas—what they are, how to recognize them,and what they can tell you about yourself. Discovering agendas that you are notaware of is the same as discovering frightened parts of your personality. Youthink that your intention is one thing, but a frightened part of yourpersonality has another intention. That is your hidden agenda, and it willremain hidden from you as long as you are unaware of the frightened part of yourpersonality that holds it.A hidden agenda may be trying to impress someone, dominate someone, feel betterabout yourself by teaching him, etc. For example, you might think that yourintention is to help someone understand authentic power and not recognize thatyou feel superior while you are in a teaching role.This week set your intention to uncover any hidden agendas you may have.When you discover during your interactions with others that you have a hiddenagenda, celebrate your discovery, even though it means that you will experiencepainful physical sensations. They are not enjoyable, but identifying frightenedparts of your personality and not being controlled by them is. For example, itcan be exhilarating to fully feel a need to withdraw, defend yourself, or becomeangry and not be controlled by it at the same time.At the end of the week, write down your answers to these questions:• How did looking for hidden agendas support you this week?• What hidden agendas did you discover in yourself?• What was the most difficult part of this Life Lesson?• What were your most significant discoveries about yourself?"},{"pageContent":"Images [../images/00011.jpeg] CHAPTER 9 Images [../images/00011.jpeg]Multisensory personalities and five-sensory personalities that are becomingmultisensory evolve through the conscious choices that they make. This is a verybig change in human evolution. Unconscious evolution through experiences thatare created unconsciously by unconscious intentions has been the way our speciesevolved until now. As you become conscious of the different parts of yourpersonality, you become able to experience consciously the forces within youthat compete for expression, that lay claim to the single intention that will beyours at each moment, that will shape your reality. Five-sensory humans do notsee these choices as important. Multisensory humans recognize them as heroic.Depending on your choices, you step closer to your soul or closer to yourpersonality. The energy of your personality is contracted, fearful, andpredatory. The energy of your soul is open, joyful, and giving. Which do youchoose? What more important choice can you make?Images [../images/00011.jpeg] CHOICE Images [../images/00011.jpeg]Choice is the engine of our evolution. Each choice is a choice of intention. Anintention is a quality of consciousness that you bring to an action or thought.A responsible choice is a choice that takes into account the consequences ofyour choice. You must ask yourself, “Am I ready to accept all the consequencesof this choice?”, “Is this what I really want?” You must become aware of thedifferent parts of your personality in order to choose responsibly. Responsiblechoice is the accelerated way of evolution of the multisensory personality. Whenyou enter your decision-making dynamic consciously, you enter consciously intoyour own evolution. Each time you create with the intentions of thesoul—forgiveness, humbleness, clarity, and love—you empower yourself. This ishow authentic power is built up—step by step, choice by choice. Temptation drawsyour awareness to negativity in you that would create painful karma if it wereallowed to remain unconscious. It enables your soul to evolve directly throughconscious choice without creating negative karma. You cleanse yourself ofnegativity without actually having to live through the experience.If you are reading an eBook, click the following link to go to an expandedonline version of this Chapter Study Guide, including video, meditation, andsupport for study groups.

If you are not aware of the dynamics within you that arecreating your experiences, the experiences they create will always be (1)surprising (“Why me?”) and (2) painful. Take a look at where you are in yourawareness.1. Have you ever asked yourself before acting or speaking, “What will this mostlikely create?”2. If so, have you ever followed up with the question “Is this what I reallywant to create—not just what I want in the moment?”3. If you knew that you could change the course of your life and the evolutionof your soul by asking yourself these questions each time before you act orspeak, would you ask them?4. Have you ever thought of temptation as a positive dynamic?5. What do you think about the idea that a temptation is a dress rehearsal for anegative karmic event?EXERCISECHOOSING ANEWThink of a situation that comes up in your life frequently where youconsistently behave the same way—argue with your spouse, have painfulinteractions with your parents or children, or are impatient with a co-worker orwith things that need to be fixed or with a driver on the freeway. Think ofsomething that you would like to change. If you are studying with another orothers, take turns. One of you read this exercise and the others close youreyes. Then switch. If you are studying alone, read the exercise, then close youreyes and do it as you remember it.Close your eyes. Recall this situation, but this time remember it as though youwere watching yourself in it. Consider the possibility that you have beenencountering situations of this kind in order to learn how to handle themdifferently, in a more conscious and constructive way.As you relive this situation in your imagination, remember it up to the timewhen you did the thing that you would rather not have done. And this time,choose a more healthy response, one that will create consequences that you wouldmuch rather experience. Realize that choosing a more healthy response willrequire courage on your part. Now choose that healthy response. Allow yourselfto see the different consequences that it creates. Write what you discovered andshare with each other if you are doing this exercise with a partner or partners.LIFE LESSONFor the next week, focus on making your choices consciously. Set your intentioneach morning and anytime you remember during the day to make responsiblechoices. Say to yourself, “I am responsible for the choices I make and theconsequences they create,” each time you are aware of making a choice. When youare unclear about what to choose, ask yourself, “What would be the healthiestchoice I could make?” Creating authentic power means making the healthiestchoice you can in the moment—the choice that may stretch you and will alwaysempower you. For example, the choice not to eat something you know your bodydoes not need; not to shout when you are angry; not to complain when you need toblame; not to gossip when you can hardly wait to talk about someone; to say nowhen someone asks you to do something that you know is not healthy for you todo, etc.At the end of the week, write down your answers to these questions:• How did reminding yourself “I am responsible for the choices I make and theconsequences they create” affect your choices?• What is the most significant discovery you made about yourself this week?HELPFUL THOUGHTRESPONSIBILITYisaSACREDword.Itmeansthe abilityto respondfromLOVErather thanautomatically reactingfromFEAR.ThisisCREATINGAUTHENTIC POWER."},{"pageContent":"Images [../images/00011.jpeg] CHAPTER 10 Images [../images/00011.jpeg]Have you ever wondered why addictions are so difficult? Addictions are thestrongest frightened parts of your personality. The greater the desire of yoursoul to heal your addiction, the greater will be the cost of keeping it. This isthe compassionate Universe showing you that your inadequacy is so deep that onlysomething of equal or greater value in opposition to it will stop you. Healingan addiction requires you to test your power of choice, to discover for yourselfthat the only intention that will empower you must come from a place within youthat suggests that you are indeed able to make responsible choices and drawpower from them. Each time you choose to challenge your addiction, you disengagefrom its power and more and more increase your personal power. You bring tolight, heal, and release the deepest currents of negativity within you. As youface your deepest struggles, you reach for your highest goals. When you strugglewith an addiction, you deal directly with the healing of your soul. This is thework that you were born to do.Images [../images/00011.jpeg] ADDICTION Images [../images/00011.jpeg]You cannot begin to heal an addiction until you acknowledge that you areaddicted. Acknowledging an addiction is acknowledging that a part of you is outof control. Once an addiction has been acknowledged, it cannot be ignored, andit cannot be healed without changing your life completely. Addictions cannot besatiated. A sexual addiction cannot be satiated by sex, a food addiction byfood, an alcohol addiction by alcohol. Addictions are frightened parts of yourpersonality that are controlled completely by external circumstances. They areyour greatest inadequacies. Sexual addictions are the most universal becauseissues of power are tied directly to the learning of sexuality. You cannot be inyour power and sexually out of control simultaneously. When you challenge anaddiction, you stand between your lesser self and your full self—betweenunconscious permission to act unconsciously and a conscious life.

Remember, an addiction is a verystrong frightened part of your personality, and everyone has frightened parts oftheir personalities. Become aware of any Story you have about this behavior. AStory is not your history. Your history is simply what happened to you. YourStory is what you tell yourself and others to explain why you are the way thatyou are, and why you are not going to change. For example, “I had an alcoholicfather,” “I was sexually abused as a child,” “My parents divorced when I wasyoung,” etc.If you do not think you have any addictions, recall a part of your personalitythat you notice is sometimes out of your control, such as overeating, watchingTV, playing cards, drinking wine with dinner, etc.As soon as you recognize this part of your personality, write down the Story youhave been telling yourself about being the way that you are when you wouldrather be different, or for your life not working the way that you want. Writein terms of parts of your personality. For example, “I have a frightened part ofmy personality that works (reads, watches TV, fixes things, etc.) all the time”or “I have a frightened part of my personality that feels it has a right to donothing, or that feels guilty about doing nothing, etc.”Set your intention each morning to find opportunities you have been given tocreate authentic power that you did not recognize in the past. Remember thatwhatever you discover is part of your curriculum in the Earth school, and begentle with yourself.At the end of the week, write down your answers to these questions:• What differences are you able to see between the way you told your Story atthe beginning of the week and the way you see it now?• Were you able to see the behavior of a frightened part of your personalitythat you did not previously recognize as an addiction?• Were you able to recognize an addiction that you were aware of in the past butthat you can now see as a frightened part of your personality? How has thisaffected your perception of yourself?"},{"pageContent":"Images [../images/00011.jpeg] CHAPTER 11 Images [../images/00011.jpeg]There are certain growing dynamics that can occur only within the dynamic ofcommitment. Without commitment, you cannot learn to care for another person morethan yourself. The archetype of spiritual partnership is designed for theconscious journey of multisensory humans toward authentic power. This isdifferent from the archetype of marriage, which was designed to assist physicalsurvival, and in which the partners do not necessarily see themselves as equals.When you commit to a spiritual partnership with another human being, or otherhuman beings, you begin to value your partners’ contribution to your developmentand to experience their perceptions and observations as helpful and, indeed,central, to your growth, to see that conversations between you stir deep waters.You learn to trust not only one another but also your ability to grow together.You are related to every form of Life upon this planet and beyond. In otherwords, as you choose to participate consciously in more inclusive levels ofinteraction, you take on not only your own transformation but also those of thelarger collectives in which you participate. Your evolution toward authenticpower, therefore, affects not only you.Images [../images/00011.jpeg] RELATIONSHIPS Images [../images/00011.jpeg]Without commitment you cannot learn to see others as your soul sees them—asbeautiful spirits of Light. Spiritual partnership is partnership between equalsfor the purpose of spiritual growth. Spiritual partners recognize the existenceof the soul and consciously seek to further its evolution. They set aside thewants of their personalities in order to accommodate the needs of theirpartners’ spiritual growth. That is how spiritual partnership works. Individualsin spiritual partnership at the level of organization, city, nation, race, andsex create new values and behaviors at these levels. The choice is alwaysbetween lower-frequency energies of the personality (fear and doubt) andhigher-frequency energies of the soul (love and trust). The external power thatseparates nations is the same that separates individuals. Individuals who alignthemselves with their souls will bring sexes, races, nations, and neighbors intoharmony. It is not just you that is evolving through your decisions but theentirety of humanity. What is in one is in the whole, and, therefore, each of usis ultimately responsible for the whole world.If you are reading an eBook, click the following link to go to an expandedonline version of this Chapter Study Guide, including video, meditation, andsupport for study groups.

Because you are reading this book, you may already beexperimenting with spiritual partnerships without even thinking in these terms,or are attracted to them. Use these questions to look at yourself as a potentialspiritual partner:1. What especially resonates with you about being a spiritual partner?2. What about the idea of being a spiritual partner feels difficult to you?3. What does it feel like to you to feel equal with others? If you cannot thinkof an experience of feeling equal (this is common), imagine what it would feellike.4. How do you think the world would be different if everyone thought in terms ofchoosing between love and fear with each choice?5. How would your world be different if you thought in terms of choosing betweenlove and fear with each choice?EXERCISEDOING IT DIFFERENTLYDo the opposite of what you usually do when you are in a power struggle. Whichrole do you usually play in a particular relationship, superior or inferior? Ifyou are studying in a group, and/or if your partner is willing, role-play theopposite way (if you are usually inferior, role-play being superior, etc.).Imagine that you have been in this power struggle many times before (which youhave), but this time you are going to change what you usually do. If you usuallyyell, you are going to withdraw. If you usually withdraw, you are going to getdefensive and argumentative.Images [../images/00009.jpeg]Now imagine that you are going to have the same power struggle, but this timeyou are going to practice using the Authentic Power Guidelines. Using theAuthentic Power Guidelines (download them from www.seatofthesoul.com[http://www.seatofthesoul.com]), role-play with your partner how you wouldinteract differently in a power struggle. Imagine how you would handle the powerstruggle in yourself and act and speak from the healthiest parts of you that youcan in the moment.Write some notes in your journal to remind you to be aware when you enter apower struggle (or react in any way). These will help you remember to respondinstead of react when a fear-based part of your personality becomes activated.LIFE LESSONOpen yourself to cultivating loving parts of your personality. Every day thisweek, set your intention to do everything you can to choose love with everyperson you encounter. During your interactions take notes about yourexperiences; notice when loving parts of your personality are active and whenfrightened parts are active.If you had difficulty experiencing equality, be gentle with yourself. Set yourintention again to cultivate the loving parts of your personality (they alwaysfeel equal with others) and challenge the frightened parts of your personality(they always feel superior or inferior).At the end of the week, write your answers to these questions. If you arestudying with a group, share them.• What were two instances when you consciously chose to create with a lovingpart of your personality and experienced equality with others?• What thoughts and intentions were you having?• What physical sensations were you having?• Write at least one specific consequence that occurred as a result of yourchoice to create with a loving part of the personality.• What have you learned about yourself from this Life Lesson?EXERCISEPOTENTIAL SPIRITUAL PARTNERPick someone you would like to have a deeper and more substantive relationshipwith, for example, a friend, sibling, spouse, or co-worker from whom you wouldbe willing to receive feedback about yourself. Now pick a frightened part ofyour personality that you want to focus on—one that you don’t always noticeuntil after you have acted on it (for example, a part of your personality thatis angry and shouts, or feels superior and acts entitled, or feels inferior andtries to please others). Make sure this is a part of your personality that youwould like help in seeing when it becomes active so that you can challenge itbefore it creates painful consequences for you again. Now ask the person youchose to tell you when he or she thinks that part of your personality is active.Write all your interactions in your journal and also write what you learnedabout yourself from each one."},{"pageContent":"Images [../images/00011.jpeg] CHAPTER 12 Images [../images/00011.jpeg]Awareness of our souls lies at the heart of creating authentic power and theneed to create authentic power. Since our origin as a species we haveexperienced ourselves as personalities—time-bound between birth and death,fearful and limited. Religions speak of souls, but few practitioners act asthough they have a soul. Multisensory perception is changing all this. Thechoice between personality/fear and soul/love is now the pivot point of ourevolution, and you must choose to align yourself with your soul again and againin order to evolve. Each choice that you make brings you closer to the Earth andyour personality or to your soul and its unfathomable love. Human evolution nowrequires us to take the health and evolution of our souls into account. This isnew. Entirely new.Images [../images/00011.jpeg] SOULS Images [../images/00011.jpeg]Your soul is the essence of who you are. It is the powerful, expansive, evolvingcenter of all that you are. As we become multisensory, we become able for thefirst time to consider our souls in real and practical ways, to relate them toour experiences and investigate how we can use knowledge of our souls to createthe most constructive lives that we can and assist our souls on theirevolutionary journeys. The idea of a soul as a static, perfect entity is asterile attempt to understand it as an “ideal form,” as Plato put it. TheUniverse and everything in it evolves toward greater awareness and freedom. Yoursoul is of the Universe, or Divine Intelligence. Divine Intelligence takes onindividual forms, droplets, massively reducing its power to small particles ofindividual consciousness. The power in each particle is as full, immortal,creative, and expressive as it is in the whole, but its energy is reducedappropriately to its form. As that little form grows in power and selfhood, itbecomes larger and more Divine. Then it becomes Divine Intelligence. Your soulis such a particle.This process parallels the process of your personality, which is of your soul,expanding into your higher self, the full power of your soul incarnate. It alsoparallels the process of your personality and higher self reentering thefullness of your soul when you leave the Earth. You cannot appreciate theimmensity of what you are and the processes in which you are participatingwithout taking into account your soul.If you are reading an eBook, click the following link to go to an expandedonline version of this Chapter Study Guide, including video, meditation, andsupport for study groups.

For the next thirty days set thisintention each morning. Each night review your day and notice when you chose itwith your words and actions and when you did not. What happened when you choseit? What happened when you did not?(From The Mind of the Soul by Gary Zukav and Linda Francis)SEEING DIFFERENTLYThink of a person you have known for a long time but you don’t feel close to andyou would like to. Do you feel inferior to or jealous of this person? Or perhapssuperior and judgmental? Why do you feel distant from this person?Have you been looking only at his or her Earth suit?Have you been focusing on her deeds or how he dresses?Have you had a misunderstanding or a fight?Have your lives taken you in different directions?Open to the possibility of seeing this person differently. Then close your eyesand picture this person. Set your intention to see beyond the appearances of heror his Earth suit.Remind yourself that you don’t know all that goes into his or herlife—challenges and fears, joys and terror. Remember that you are a soul, and sois this person.Notice how you feel about this person now. Do you feel compassion? If not, dothis exercise over and over until you feel a shift from contraction to openness,from seeing this person only as a personality to knowing that he or she is asoul wearing an Earth suit. Allow yourself to feel the instant that your fear,judgment, and disdain disappear and reverence appears.(From The Mind of the Soul by Gary Zukav and Linda Francis)A TRUE STORYMy adopted Sioux brother, Phil Lane, Jr., told me this story. A female elderonce asked him, “Nephew, what is the holiest of all ceremonies?” My Siouxbrother thought carefully and then answered, “Vision quest, sweat lodge, or sundance.” “Yes,” said the old woman, “those are all holy and sacred ceremonies,but the holiest of all ceremonies is the birth of a child.” Then she lookeddirectly at him and asked, “Then what does that make you?”"},{"pageContent":"Images [../images/00011.jpeg] CHAPTER 13 Images [../images/00011.jpeg]Now that we are becoming multisensory, a new psychology—spiritual psychology—isneeded. The personality is specific aspects of the soul reduced to a physicalform. Therefore, dysfunctions of the personality cannot be understood without anunderstanding of the soul. Psychology seeks to heal the personality withoutrecognizing the force of the soul that lies behind the configuration andexperiences of the personality and, therefore, cannot heal at the level of thesoul. The characteristics of a personality cannot always be understood in termsof the history of the personality because they may reflect experiences thatpredate the personality, in some cases by centuries.The healing power at the core of psychology is the power of consciousness.Seeking out, facing with courage, and bringing into the light of consciousnessthat which is unconscious and, therefore, in a position of power over thepersonality is what heals. When that which needs to be made conscious is notrecognized to exist—such as experiences of lifetimes that were lived in otherplaces and at other times—it cannot be healed in this way. Spiritual psychologywill illuminate the relationship between the personality and the soul, makeexplicit the effects of interactions between personalities from the perspectiveof the impersonal energy dynamics that they set into motion, and show how thesedynamics can be used to heal.Images [../images/00011.jpeg] PSYCHOLOGY Images [../images/00011.jpeg]Psychology means soul knowledge, but because five-sensory psychology does notrecognize the existence of the soul, it cannot understand the soul’stemperament, what it can and cannot tolerate, what contributes to its health,and what breaks its health down. The fears, angers, and jealousies that deform apersonality cannot be understood apart from the karmic circumstances they serve.Without awareness of the experiences of other lifetimes of your soul, you cannotappreciate the potential awakenings that your interactions with others offeryou. Your experiences are karmic necessities. When you realize this, you canchoose not to react to them personally. When you engage in brutality, abundancesof pain, irrationality, non-forgiveness, jealousies, hatreds, or lying toothers, you diminish the strength of your soul, not to be confused with itsimmortality. Creating authentic power requires that you recognize the existenceof your soul and grow in knowledge of what it is and what it wants. Spiritualpsychology is a disciplined and systematic study of these things.If you are reading an eBook, click the following link to go to an expandedonline version of this Chapter Study Guide, including video, meditation, andsupport for study groups.

These questions will help you learn more about yoursoul and your relation to it. What other questions can you ask yourself?1. Have you seriously considered the existence of your soul?2. Have you ever thought in terms of consciously assisting your soul in itsevolution?3. If you really believed that brutality, abundances of pain, irrationality,non-forgiveness, jealousies, hatreds, and lying to others prevent you fromassisting your soul to evolve, would you think twice before indulging in them?4. If your experiences really were karmic necessities, what could you accomplishby becoming upset with the people who bring them into your life?5. How do you feel about the idea of living your life with an awareness of yoursoul and what would be best for it?HELPFUL THOUGHTHave you left a partner or a spouse? Has a spouse or a partner left you? It maybe that your souls have graciously and with great compassion agreed to enactwithin this lifetime a situation that they have experienced together in anotherlifetime, or other lifetimes, a situation that still has healing potential forboth. It may be that your souls have agreed to a mutual balancing of energy, sothat one experiences the same painful loss that it inflicted previously upon theother. Experiences such as these are not meant to cause meaningless pain. Thereis not one act in the Universe that is not compassionate.EXERCISEAUTHENTIC NEEDSWhen you strive to fulfill an artificial need, you are pursuing external power.A frightened part of your personality is controlling you. You strive to feelbetter about yourself and safe. If your need is artificial, you will be attachedto having it met.On the other hand, when you strive to fulfill your authentic needs, you arecreating authentic power. You are choosing from a loving part of yourpersonality that is in alignment with your soul and always strives to createauthentic power. The Universe is that which fulfills your authentic needs, suchas the need to grow spiritually, to cocreate for the common good, to love and beloved, and to contribute to Life.It is easy to get caught in frightened parts of your personality and theirartificial needs. Sometimes these parts of your personality are so familiar toyou that they are very difficult to see unless you focus on becoming aware ofthem.• Set your intention each day to recognize the difference between yourartificial needs and your authentic needs. The needs that come from frightenedparts of your personality are artificial—they are means of manipulating andcontrolling. Your authentic needs are to love and be loved, to give the giftsthat your soul wants to give, and to create authentic power, among others.• Make a list of your authentic needs and your artificial needs this week. Letyour intuition guide you in distinguishing between them.• At the end of the week, write in your journal what you discovered regardingyour authentic needs and your artificial needs. Give examples.• What was the most surprising discovery you made about yourself and artificialneeds versus authentic needs?"},{"pageContent":"Images [../images/00011.jpeg] CHAPTER 14 Images [../images/00011.jpeg]Some traditions speak of life as an “illusion,” but getting hit by a truck,becoming ill, and having your home foreclosed are very real events. How can wespeak of concrete circumstances such as these as “illusions”? Each interactionwith each individual and circumstance is part of a continual learning dynamic.This dynamic provides each individual at each moment a perfect opportunity togrow spiritually. Each interaction creates emotions within us, and each emotionis an experience of love or an experience of fear. Sooner or later—sometimeslifetimes later—we begin to see that acting on fear, such as anger, resentment,and jealousy, creates painful consequences (Law of Cause and Effect) andattracts others with these energies (Law of Attraction), and that when we actwith love, such as gratitude, appreciation, patience, and caring, we createblissful consequences and also attract like energy. Eventually we become moreinterested in acting with love instead of with fear, regardless of what ishappening around us, including accidents, illness, and foreclosures, andregardless of what is happening inside us, including anger, resentment, andjealousy. Eventually, we see everything as an opportunity to create with loveinstead of fear. This is spiritual growth. Fear creates the illusion thatsomething should not have happened, that painful experiences are negative, andlove dispels this illusion. Consciously using the illusion to grow spirituallyis creating authentic power.Images [../images/00011.jpeg] ILLUSION Images [../images/00011.jpeg]The illusion allows each soul to perceive what it needs to understand in orderto heal. The illusion for each soul is created by its intentions. A personalitythat lives in love and Light can see the illusion and not be drawn into it.Every experience of fear, anger, or jealousy is an illusion designed to bringyour awareness to parts of your personality that require healing. The illusionhas no power over you when you are fully aligned with your soul. Eachpersonality attracts others with like consciousness. This is the Law ofAttraction—anger attracts anger, greed attracts greed, compassion attractscompassion. Human emotions fall into two groups: love and fear. The illusion ofeach personality is generated by the frightened parts of its personality. Thepersonality that follows a frightened part of itself chooses negative behavior,experiences the same behavior from another (this is the Law of Karma) and againreceives the opportunity to release that negativity. This is how the illusionworks.If you are reading an eBook, click the following link to go to an expandedonline version of this Chapter Study Guide, including video, meditation, andsupport for study groups.

The old understanding is theability to manipulate and control. The new understanding of power is thealignment of the personality with the soul. Multisensory perception and the newunderstanding of power cannot be separated. Multisensory perception is emergingwithin us whether or not we ask for it. Authentic power is our new potential.Each of us must create it for ourselves. Those who do not will continueunconsciously to manipulate and control and thereby unconsciously create violentand destructive consequences.This is the new lay of the land. All of our old maps are obsolete. We are nowevolving in uncharted territory. Our new polestar is the soul and itsintentions—harmony, cooperation, sharing, and reverence for Life. Our tools areemotional awareness, responsible choice, and intuition. The new requirements ofour evolution are commitment (to growing spiritually), courage (to enter ourlives consciously), compassion (for ourselves and others), and consciouscommunications and actions that serve our spiritual development and support thespiritual development of others. Never before has a transformation of humanconsciousness occurred. Until now, the content of consciousness has changed.This is our history. Now our history, like a great river, has taken an abruptplunge into new meaning, astonishing depth, immeasurable richness, andunimaginable fulfillment. Now is the time for us to swim in the great riverconsciously instead of being carried unconsciously through our lives by it, tosee who is in the river with us, and to celebrate.Images [../images/00011.jpeg] POWER Images [../images/00011.jpeg]Authentic power is energy that is formed by the intentions of the soul. It isLight shaped by love and compassion guided by wisdom. There is no power in fearor in any of the activities generated by fear. When energy leaves you in fear ordistrust, you experience physical pain in your body near the energy centers thatare losing power. For example, when you feel that you cannot care for or protectyourself, you feel pain or discomfort in your stomach area. When you feel youcannot give or receive love, you feel pain or discomfort in your chest area.Every physical dysfunction can be understood as a loss of power to an externalcircumstance or object through one of the seven energy centers in the body. Whenenergy leaves you in any way except in strength and trust, it brings you onlypain and discomfort. An authentically empowered human releases its energy onlyin love and trust. The characteristics of an authentically empowered personalityare humbleness, forgiveness, clarity, and love.If you are reading an eBook, click the following link to go to an expandedonline version of this Chapter Study Guide, including video, meditation, andsupport for study groups.

It requires openness to new thoughts, new waysof looking at things, and new ways of thinking. If openness is replaced by blindadherence to dogma, a fundamentalism is born instead of trust—rigid, demanding,righteous, and intimidating. Cliques, cultures, and congregations come intobeing that refuse to explore the endless diversity and boundless richness ofLife and to experiment with love for self and others. Even cliques, cultures,and congregations that profess love become fortresses of fear. Trust in thecompassion and wisdom of the Universe takes root in clarity, humbleness,forgiveness, and love—the characteristics of an authentically empoweredpersonality. Multisensory perception is the species-wide game changer that istransforming trust in the wisdom and compassion of the Universe into theperception of the wisdom and compassion of the Universe. When even the mostdifficult circumstances, such as suffering, poverty, illness, cruelty,exploitation, and violence, become visible as opportunities to develop emotionalawareness and responsible choice, to choose love instead of fear, to grow in joyand freedom, to create authentic power—where is the need for trust?

They are not always experiencesthat you would choose. Your nonphysical Teachers continually support you.Delight in your dependency on them. Look at your life as a beautifullywell-organized dynamic. Keep your power in the now. Challenge your fears. Setyour intentions. Open to fellow humans. Pray. Prayer is moving into a personalrelationship with Divine Intelligence. Say to the Universe, “Thy will be done,”and take your hands off the steering wheel. Allow your life to go into the handsof the Universe completely.
