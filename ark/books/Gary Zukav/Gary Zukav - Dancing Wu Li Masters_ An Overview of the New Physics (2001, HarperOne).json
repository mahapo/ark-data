Watching the book grow has beeninstructive and rewarding, because Zukav has insisted on going through the wholeevolution of the quantum relativistic physics of today, treating it as it is, anunfolding story. As a result this book is not only readable, but it also putsthe reader in touch with all the various ways that physicists have worked outfor talking about what is so hard to talk about. In short, Gary Zukav haswritten a very good book for laymen.Zukav’s attitude to physics is rather close to mine, so I must be a layman too,and it is more stimulating to talk physics with him than with mostprofessionals. He knows that physics is—among other things—an attempt toharmonize with a much greater entity than ourselves, requiring us to seek,formulate and eradicate first one and then another of our most cherishedprejudices and oldest habits of thought, in a never-ending quest for theunattainable.Zukav has graciously offered me this place to add my own emphases to hisnarrative. Since it has been three years since we met, I must sift my memory fora while.Migrating whales come to mind first. I remember us standing on the Esalen cliffsand watching them cavort as they headed south. Next comes to mind beautifulMonarch butterflies, dotting the fields from the first day, and covering onemagic tree as thick as leaves in a grand finale. Between the whales and thebutterflies it was difficult for us to feel self-important and very easy for usto play.The very difficulty of communicating with the physicists at Esalen helped me torealize how differently most physicists think about quantum mechanics than I do.Not that my way is new, it is one of two ways already pointed out in John VonNeumann’s 1932 book, The Mathematical Foundation of Quantum Mechanics: 1. Quantum mechanics deals with propositions defined by processes of preparation and observation involving subject and object and obeying a new logic; not with objective properties of the object alone. 2. Quantum mechanics deals with objective properties of the object alone, obeying the old logic, but they jump in a random way when an observation is made.Most working physicists seem to see one of these ways (the second) and not theother. Perhaps personality can determine the direction of science. I think thereare “thing” minds and “people” minds. Good parents, psychologists and writershave to be “people” people, while mechanics, engineers and physicists tend to be“thing” people. Physics has become too scary for such physicists because it isalready so thingless. New evolutions, as profound as those of Einstein andHeisenberg, are waiting for a new generation of more daring and integratedthinkers.While most physicists take for granted the quantum tools of their daily work,there is a vanguard already testing roads to the next physics, and a rearguardstill conscientiously holding the road back to the old. Bell’s theorem is mainlyimportant to the latter, and its prominence in the book does not mean ituncovers problems in present-day quantum physics. Rather Bell’s theorem drivestoward a view that most physicists already assume: that quantum mechanics issomething new and different.Here it helps to distinguish between a complete theory, predicting everything,what Newtonians look for (it does not seem that Newton was a strict Newtonian,since he wanted God to reset the world clock now and then) and a maximal theory,predicting as much as possible, what quantum physicists look for. In spite oftheir controversy, Einstein and Bohr both agreed, in their different ways, thatquantum mechanics is incomplete, and even that it is not yet maximal. What theyreally debated was whether or not an incomplete theory can be maximal.Throughout their famous controversy Einstein argued, “Alas, our theory is toopoor for experience,” and Bohr replied, “No, no! Experience is too rich for ourtheory”; just as some existential philosophers despair at the indeterminacy oflife and the existence of choices, and others feel élan vital.One of the features of quantum mechanics that leads to such controversy is itsconcern with the nonexistent, the potential. There is some of this in alllanguage, or words could only be used once, but quantum mechanics is moreinvolved with probabilities than classical mechanics. Some people feel thisdiscredits quantum theory, makes it less than maximal theory. So it is importantto mention in defense of quantum theory that in spite of indeterminacy, quantummechanics can be entirely expressed in yes-or-no terms about individualexperiments, just like classical mechanics, and that probabilities can bederived as a law of large numbers and need not be postulated. I prefer to statethe difference between classical and quantum theories not as presented intextbooks, but thus: Once sufficient data is given, classical mechanics givesyes-or-no answers for all further questions while quantum mechanics simplyleaves unanswered some questions in the theory, to be answered by experience. Iwish here also to note the regrettable tendency, in myself also, to feel thatquantum mechanics must thereby deny physical existence to those answers that arefound in experience only, not in the theory, such as the momentum of a localizedelectron. So involved are we in our symbol systems.After a week of talking, the conference was still working on the elements ofquantum logic, and never did get far into the new quantum time concepts wewanted to try out, but it made it easier to move on to the next set of problems,which occupy me today. Quantum mechanics is characterized by its unansweredquestions. Some logicians, Martin Davis for one, have suggested these may berelated to the undecidable propositions dominating logic since Gödel. I used toknow better. Nowadays I think they may be right, the common element beingreflexivity and the impossibility for finite systems of total self-knowledge.The proper study of mankind is endless, it seems. I hope these ideas work outand Gary Zukav writes a book about them. He does it well.DAVID FINKELSTEINNew YorkJuly 1978"},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO THE PERENNIAL CLASSICS EDITION[dancingwulimastersthe_con01.html#fm_04]When I wrote The Dancing Wu Li Masters: An Overview of the New Physics, I hadnever written a book and I had never studied physics. In fact, I didn’t likescience and I had no mathematical aptitudes. Yet while I was writing The DancingWu Li Masters, I knew it would be published and that it would be very wellreceived. I also knew that it would sell very well for many years after itspublication. I did not need to have faith in these things. I knew them. I couldsee them. It was clear to me that all I needed to do to make them happen was tocontinue writing. In other words, to do was my part. I knew that without mypart, none of what I saw would happen, and that with my part, it was alreadyaccomplished.I was the key. Everything depended only upon my doing what I was alreadydoing—writing about physics, studying physics, discussing physics, and writingabout it again each day. That was no problem for me because I loved doing thosethings. I woke thinking about the ideas in The Dancing Wu Li Masters and I wentto sleep thinking about them the same way that some people wake in the morningand go to sleep at night thinking about a Beloved. Every decision about whatword or words to use, what ideas to include, and how to present a discussion wasmade with the reader in mind. “The reader,” no matter whom I pictured in thatrole, was always someone who was intelligent—perhaps more intelligent than I. Heor she was keenly interested in all that I had to share, but had no backgroundin science or mathematics.I do not know how I knew these things while I was writing The Dancing Wu LiMasters—that it would be published, that it would be well received, and that itwould sell around the world for a very long time—but they were realities to me.I also knew that I would not remain interested in physics indefinitely, eventhough it was my passion at the moment. Because of that, I decided to leavebehind me the best gift that I could for those who would come later. A spirit ofgiving pervades this book, and that is one reason why, I believe, The Dancing WuLi Masters has been so appreciated by more than a million readers, in manylanguages, around the world.Another reason is that The Dancing Wu Li Masters contains within it the seed ofthe thought that consciousness lies at the heart of all that we can experience,all that we can conceive, and all that we are. It also points toward thepossibility that intentions create the reality that we experience. Thesethoughts were pondered by many of the founders of quantum mechanics as theydiscussed complementarity, the Uncertainty Principle and other aspects of themathematical formalism that became known as the quantum theory. They are stillpondered by philosophically inclined physicists today.When I began writing The Dancing Wu Li Masters, I could only suspect or deducethings about the role of consciousness and intention in the creation ofexperience, but I soon discovered that some of the founders of quantum mechanicshad suspected and deduced the same things decades before me. This was excitingenough, yet as I became more engaged in the writing, I began to encounterphenomena that I never could have imagined. For example, I realized that thebook that I was writing was more intelligent than I was. It was also funnierthan I was, and it had a grander comprehension than I did. For example, Iprepared an outline for each chapter before I began to write. The outlinecontained the central idea of the chapter, what I wanted to include in thechapter, how I intended to order the content of the chapter, and how I intendedto present the ideas in the chapter.In every instance, I would write not for long before I had to choose betweenfollowing the outline that I had prepared and going with the energy thatdeveloped as I wrote. I always went with the energy. If I had planned a certaindiscussion, but another one occurred to me that felt more exciting, I used thesecond discussion. I substituted examples, words, and ideas as they occurred tome for those that I had put into my outline. And I was amazed at the experienceof a chapter coming to an end—at how clear it was for me, and how often theending of a chapter surprised and delighted me.As I wrote more chapters, I noticed something else, too. The chapters fittogether perfectly—even though I had not planned them that way. I might havebeen able to take credit for this if I had followed each of the outlines that Ihad prepared. But I never followed my outlines. I always followed the flow ofenergy and excitement that I felt as I wrote.Who orchestrated this? Who planned for a chapter—one that I completed before Ibegan research on a later chapter—to fit into a later chapter as though I hadwritten them together? Where did the humor in the book come from—the humor thattook me away from the torment of my daily judgements about myself and others?Where did the gratitude originate that replaced my worries about paying therent, which obsessed me when I was not writing?Eventually, the reality of these miracles became a part of my awareness. So didthe contrast between the painful life that I lived when I was not working on TheDancing Wu Li Masters and the fulfillment that I felt when I was. At last, Idecided to live my entire life the way that The Dancing Wu Li Masters was beingwritten—spontaneously, intelligently, and joyfully. Eventually I learned how todo this, and how to explain how to do it.At the time I did not have the vocabulary to articulate what I was experiencing,or the ability to understand it. It was not until later that I was able tounderstand that writing The Dancing Wu Li Masters was my first experience ofauthentic power—of meaning, fulfillment, and purpose. It was also my firstexperience of nonphysical assistance.Now there is a vocabulary to express what I experienced. It is the vocabulary ofauthentic power—the alignment of the personality with the soul—and ofmultisensory perception: the expansion of human perception beyond thelimitations of the five senses. I could not see at the time that my experienceswere part of an evolutionary transformation that was, and still is, reshapinghuman experience. This transformation and the vocabulary to express it are thecontent of The Seat of the Soul, which I wrote ten years after The Dancing Wu LiMasters was published.This same evolutionary transformation continues to reshape human experience, onehuman at a time. As multisensory perception—the ability to access informationthat the five senses cannot provide—emerges in millions of humans, theynaturally become interested in the relationship between consciousness andphysical reality. The Dancing Wu Li Masters is a nourishing book for theseindividuals, and will continue to be, because it explores that relationship withenthusiasm and integrity.The last reason, I believe, that The Dancing Wu Li Masters is still so popularis that it is fun to read. It is an enjoyable way to learn about quantummechanics, especially for people who have no mathematical or scientificbackground. It brings the early history of the quantum theory to life in arefreshing and exciting way, and that history will not change. The developmentof the quantum theory is one of the most well-documented intellectual adventuresin the history of humanity. For those who come to this history as a newcomer, asI did, without preparation or prior interest, as I did, but with an open andexcited mind, as mine was, The Dancing Wu Li Masters is the perfect book.This Perennial Classics edition celebrates the contributions that The Dancing WuLi Masters has made for more than two decades to those who delight in the rigorsof intellectual exploration into the most meaningful questions that philosophyand science can pose. It is a product of that delight.I hope that you enjoy it. With Love,Gary Zukav"},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION [dancingwulimastersthe_con01.html#fm_05]My first exposure to quantum physics occurred a few years ago when a friendinvited me to an afternoon conference at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory inBerkeley, California. At that time, I had no connections with the scientificcommunity, so I went to see what physicists were like. To my great surprise, Idiscovered that (1) I understood everything that they said, and (2) theirdiscussion sounded very much like a theological discussion. I scarcely couldbelieve what I had discovered. Physics was not the sterile, boring disciplinethat I had assumed it to be. It was a rich, profound venture which had becomeinseparable from philosophy. Incredibly, no one but physicists seemed to beaware of this remarkable development. As my interest in and knowledge of physicsgrew, I resolved to share this discovery with others. This book is a gift of mydiscovery. It is one of a series.Generally speaking, people can be grouped into two categories of intellectualpreference. The first group prefers explorations which require a precision oflogical processes. These are the people who become interested in the naturalsciences and mathematics. They do not become scientists because of theireducation, they choose a scientific education because it gratifies theirscientific mental set. The second group prefers explorations which involve theintellect in a less logically rigorous manner. These are the people who becomeinterested in the liberal arts. They do not have a liberal arts mentalitybecause of their education, they choose a liberal arts education because itgratifies their liberal arts mental set.Since both groups are intelligent, it is not difficult for members of one groupto understand what members of the other group are studying. However, I havediscovered a notable communication problem between the two groups. Many times myphysicist friends have attempted to explain a concept to me and, in theirexasperation, have tried one explanation after another, each one of whichsounded (to me) abstract, difficult to grasp, and generally abstruse. When Icould comprehend, at last, what they were trying to communicate, inevitably Iwas surprised to discover that the idea itself was actually quite simple.Conversely, I often have tried to explain a concept in terms which seemed (tome) laudably lucid, but which, to my exasperation, seemed hopelessly vague,ambiguous, and lacking in precision to my physicist friends. I hope that thisbook will be a useful translation which will help those people who do not have ascientific mental set (like me) to understand the extraordinary process which isoccurring in theoretical physics. Like any translation, it is not as good as theoriginal work and, of course, it is subject to the shortcomings of thetranslator. For better or worse, my first qualification as a translator is that,like you, I am not a physicist.To compensate for my lack of education in physics (and for my liberal artsmentality) I asked, and received, the assistance of an extraordinary group ofphysicists. (They are listed in the acknowledgments). Four of them inparticular, read the entire manuscript. As each chapter was completed, I sent acopy of it to each physicist and asked him to correct any conceptual or factualerrors which he found. (Several other physicists read selected chapters.)My original intention was to use these comments to correct the text. However, Isoon discovered that my physicist friends had given more attention to themanuscript than I had dared to hope. Not only were their comments thoughtful andpenetrating, but, taken together, they formed a significant volume ofinformation by themselves. The more I studied them, the more strongly I feltthat I should share these comments with you. Therefore, in addition tocorrecting the manuscript with them, I also included in the footnotes thosecomments which do not duplicate the corrected text. In particular, I footnotedthose comments which would have slowed the flow of the text or made ittechnical, and those comments which disagreed with the text and also disagreedwith the comments of the other physicists. By publishing dissenting opinions inthe footnotes, I have been able to include numerous ideas which would havelengthened and complicated the book if they had been presented in the text. Fromthe beginning of The Dancing Wu Li Masters to the end, no term is used which isnot explained immediately before or after its first use. This rule is notfollowed in the footnotes. This gives the footnotes an unmitigated freedom ofexpression. However, it also means that the footnotes contain terms that are notexplained before, during, or after their use. The text respects your status asnewcomer to a vast and exciting realm. The footnotes do not.However, if you read the footnotes as you read the book, you will have the rareopportunity to see what four of the finest physicists in the world have to sayabout it as they, in effect, read it along with you. Their footnotes punctuate,illustrate, annotate, and jab at everything in the text. Better than it can bedescribed, these footnotes reveal the aggressive precision with which men ofscience seek to remove the flaws from the work of a fellow scientist, even if heis an untrained colleague, like me, and the work is nontechnical, like thisbook.The “new physics,” as it is used in this book, means quantum mechanics, whichbegan with Max Planck’s theory of quanta in 1900, and relativity, which beganwith Albert Einstein’s special theory of relativity in 1905. The old physics isthe physics of Isaac Newton, which he discovered about three hundred years ago.“Classical physics” means any physics that attempts to explain reality in such amanner that for every element of physical reality there is a correspondingelement in the theory. Therefore, “classical physics” includes the physics ofIsaac Newton and relativity, both of which are structured in this one-to-onemanner. It does not, however, include quantum mechanics, which, as we shall see,is one of the things that makes quantum mechanics unique.Be gentle with yourself as you read. This book contains many rich andmultifaceted stories, all of which are heady (pun?) stuff. You cannot learn themall at once any more than you can learn the stories told in War and Peace, Crimeand Punishment, and Les Misérables all at once. I suggest that you read thisbook for your pleasure, and not to learn what is in it. There is a completeindex at the back of the book and a good table of contents in the front. Betweenthe two of them, you can return to any subject that catches your interest.Moreover, by enjoying yourself, you probably will remember more than if you hadset about to learn it all.One last note; this is not a book about physics and eastern philosophies.Although the poetic framework of Wu Li is conducive to such comparisons, thisbook is about quantum physics and relativity. In the future I hope to writeanother book specifically about physics and Buddhism. In view of the easternflavor of Wu Li, however, I have included in this book those similaritiesbetween eastern philosophies and physics that seemed to me so obvious andsignificant that I felt that I would be doing you a disservice if I did notmention them in passing.Happy reading.GARY ZUKAVSan FranciscoJuly 1978image [Images/xxxvi.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"PART ONEWU LI? [dancingwulimastersthe_con01.html#pt_01]"},{"pageContent":"1BIG WEEK AT BIG SUR [dancingwulimastersthe_con01.html#ch_01]When I tell my friends that I study physics, they move their heads from side toside, they shake their hands at the wrist, and they whistle, “Whew! That’sdifficult.” This universal reaction to the word “physics” is a wall that standsbetween what physicists do and what most people think they do. There is usuallya big difference between the two.Physicists themselves are partly to blame for this sad situation. Their shoptalk sounds like advanced Greek, unless you are Greek or a physicist. When theyare not talking to other physicists, physicists speak English. Ask them whatthey do, however, and they sound like the natives of Corfu again.On the other hand, part of the blame is ours. Generally speaking, we have givenup trying to understand what physicists (and biologists, etc.) really do. Inthis we do ourselves a disservice. These people are engaged in extremelyinteresting adventures that are not that difficult to understand. True, how theydo what they do sometimes entails a technical explanation which, if you are notan expert, can produce an involuntary deep sleep. What physicists do, however,is actually quite simple. They wonder what the universe is really made of, howit works, what we are doing in it, and where it is going, if it is goinganyplace at all. In short, they do the same things that we do on starry nightswhen we look up at the vastness of the universe and feel overwhelmed by it and apart of it at the same time. That is what physicists really do, and the cleverrascals get paid for doing it.Unfortunately, when most people think of “physics,” they think of chalkboardscovered with undecipherable symbols of an unknown mathematics. The fact is thatphysics is not mathematics. Physics, in essence, is simple wonder at the waythings are and a divine (some call it compulsive) interest in how that is so.Mathematics is the tool of physics. Stripped of mathematics, physics becomespure enchantment.I had spoken often to a friend, who was a physicist, about the possibility ofwriting a book, unencumbered with technicalities and mathematics, to explain theexciting insights that motivate current physics. So when he invited me to aconference on physics that he and Michael Murphy were arranging at the EsalenInstitute, I accepted with a purpose.The Esalen Institute (it is named for an Indian tribe) is in northernCalifornia. The northern California coast is an awesome combination of power andbeauty, but nowhere so much as along the Pacific Coast Highway between the townsof Big Sur and San Luis Obispo. The Esalen facilities are located about a halfhour south of Big Sur between the highway and the coastal mountains on the oneside and rugged cliffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean on the other. A dancingstream divides the northern third of the grounds from the remainder. On thatside is a big house (called the Big House) where guests stay and groups meet,along with a small home where Dick Price (co-founder of Esalen with Murphy)stays with his family. On the other side of the stream is a lodge where mealsare served and meetings are held, accommodations for guests and staff, and hotsulfur baths.Dinner at Esalen is a multidimensional experience. The elements are candlelight,organic food, and a contagious naturalness that is the essence of the Esalenexperience. I joined two men who already were eating. One was David Finkelstein,a physicist from Yeshiva University (in New York) who was attending theconference on physics. The other was Al Chung-liang Huang, a T’ai Chi Master whowas leading a workshop at Esalen. I could not have chosen better companions.The conversation soon turned to physics.“When I studied physics in Taiwan,” said Huang, “we called it Wu Li (pronounced‘Woo Lee’). It means ‘Patterns of Organic Energy.’”Everyone at the table was taken at once by this image. Mental lights flashed on,one by one, as the idea penetrated. “Wu Li” was more than poetic. It was thebest definition of physics that the conference would produce. It caught thatcertain something, that living quality that we were seeking to express in abook, that thing without which physics becomes sterile.“Let’s write a book about Wu Li!” I heard myself exclaim. Immediately, ideas andenergy began to flow, and in one stroke all of the prior planning that I haddone went out the window. From that pooling of energy came the image of theDancing Wu Li Masters. My remaining days at Esalen and those that followed weredevoted to finding out what Wu Li Masters are, and why they dance. All of ussensed with excitement and certitude that we had discovered the channel throughwhich the very things that we wanted to say about physics would flow. The Chinese language does not use an alphabet like western languages. Each wordin Chinese is depicted by a character, which is a line drawing. (Sometimes twoor more characters are combined to form different meanings.) This is why it isdifficult to translate Chinese into English. Good translations require atranslator who is both a poet and a linguist.For example, “Wu” can mean either “matter” or “energy.” “Li” is a richly poeticword. It means “universal order” or “universal law.” It also means “organicpatterns.” The grain in a panel of wood is Li. The organic pattern on thesurface of a leaf is also Li, and so is the texture of a rose petal. In short,Wu Li, the Chinese word for physics, means “patterns of organic energy”(“matter/energy” [Wu] + “universal order/organic patterns” [Li]. This isremarkable since it reflects a world view which the founders of western science(Galileo and Newton) simply did not comprehend, but toward which virtually everyphysical theory of import in the twentieth century is pointing! The question isnot, “Do they know something that we don’t?” The question is, “How do they knowit?”English words can be pronounced almost any way without changing their meanings.I was five years a college graduate before I learned to pronounce “consummate”as an adjective (con-SUM-mate). (It means “carried to the utmost extent ordegree; perfect”). I live in anguish when I think of the times that I havespoken of consummate linguists, consummate scholars, etc. Someone always seemedto be holding back a smile, almost. I learned later that these were the peoplewho read dictionaries. Nonetheless, my bad pronunciation never prevented me frombeing understood. That is because inflections do not change the denotation of anEnglish word. “No” spoken with a rising inflection (“No?”), with a downwardinflection (“No!”), and with no inflection (“No…”) all mean (according to thedictionary) “a denial, a refusal, negative.”This is not so in Chinese. Most Chinese syllables can be pronounced severaldifferent ways. Each different pronunciation is a different word which iswritten differently and which has a meaning of its own. Therefore, the samesyllable, pronounced with different inflections, which unaccustomed westernlisteners scarcely can distinguish, constitutes distinctly separate words, eachwith its own ideogram and meaning, to a Chinese listener. In English, which isan atonal language, these different ideograms are all written and pronounced thesame way.For example, there are over eighty different “Wu”s in Chinese, all of which arespelled and pronounced the same way in English. Al Huang has taken five of these“Wu”s, each of which, when combined with “Li,” produces a different “Wu Li,”each with the same English spelling, and each pronounced (in English) “Woo Lee.”The first Wu Li means “Patterns of Organic Energy.” This is the Chinese way ofsaying “physics.” (Wu means “matter” or “energy”).The second Wu Li means “My Way.” (Wu means “mine” or “self.”)The third Wu Li means “Nonsense.” (Wu means “void” or “nonbeing.”)The fourth Wu Li means “I Clutch My Ideas.” (Wu means “to make a fist” or“clutch with a closed hand.”)The fifth Wu Li means “Enlightenment.” (Wu means “enlightenment” or “my heart/mymind.”)If we were to stand behind a master weaver as he begins to work his loom, wewould see, at first, not cloth, but a multitude of brightly colored threads fromwhich he picks and chooses with his expert eye, and feeds into the movingshuttle. As we continue to watch, the threads blend one into the other, a fabricappears, and on the fabric, behold! A pattern emerges.In a similar manner, Al Huang has created a beautiful tapestry from his ownepistemological loom: PHYSICS = WU LIWu Li = Patterns of Organic EnergyWu Li = My WayWu Li = NonsenseWu Li = I Clutch My IdeasWu Li = Enlightenment Each of the physicists at the conference, to a person, reported a resonance withthis rich metaphor. Here, at last, was the vehicle through which we couldpresent the seminal elements of advanced physics. By the end of the week,everyone at Esalen was talking about Wu Li. At the same time that this was happening, I was trying to find out what a“Master” is. The dictionary was no help. All of its definitions involved anelement of control. This did not fit easily into our image of the Dancing Wu LiMasters. Since Al Huang is a T’ai Chi Master, I asked him.“That is the word that other people use to describe me,” he said. To Al Huang,Al Huang was just Al Huang.Later in the week, I asked him the same question again, hoping to get a moretangible answer.“A Master is someone who started before you did,” was what I got that time.My western education left me unable to accept a nondefinition for my definitionof a “Master,” so I began to read Huang’s book, Embrace Tiger, Return toMountain. There, in the foreword by Alan Watts, in a paragraph describing AlHuang, I found what I sought. Said Alan Watts of Al Huang:He begins from the center and not from the fringe. He imparts an understandingof the basic principles of the art before going on to the meticulous details,and he refuses to break down the t’ai chi movements into a one-two-three drillso as to make the student into a robot. The traditional way…is to teach by rote,and to give the impression that long periods of boredom are the most essentialpart of training. In that way a student may go on for years and years withoutever getting the feel of what he is doing.1Here was just the definition of a Master that I sought. A Master teachesessence. When the essence is perceived, he teaches what is necessary to expandthe perception. The Wu Li Master does not speak of gravity until the studentstands in wonder at the flower petal falling to the ground. He does not speak oflaws until the student, of his own, says, “How strange! I drop two stonessimultaneously, one heavy and one light, and both of them reach the earth at thesame moment!” He does not speak of mathematics until the student says, “Theremust be a way to express this more simply.”In this way, the Wu Li Master dances with his student. The Wu Li Master does notteach, but the student learns. The Wu Li Master always begins at the center, atthe heart of the matter. This is the approach that we take in this book. It iswritten for intelligent people who want to know about advanced physics but whoare ignorant of its terminology and, perhaps, of its mathematics. The Dancing WuLi Masters is a book of essence; the essence of quantum mechanics, quantumlogic, special relativity, general relativity, and some new ideas that indicatethe direction that physics seems to be moving. Of course, who can know where thefuture goes? The only surety is that what we think today will be a part of thepast tomorrow. Therefore, this book deals not with knowledge, which is alwayspast tense anyway, but with imagination, which is physics come alive, which isWu Li.One of the greatest physicists of all, Albert Einstein, was perhaps a Wu LiMaster. In 1938 he wrote:Physical concepts are free creations of the human mind, and are not, however itmay seem, uniquely determined by the external world. In our endeavor tounderstand reality we are somewhat like a man trying to understand the mechanismof a closed watch. He sees the face and the moving hands, even hears itsticking, but he has no way of opening the case. If he is ingenious he may formsome picture of a mechanism which could be responsible for all the things heobserves, but he may never be quite sure his picture is the only one which couldexplain his observations. He will never be able to compare his picture with thereal mechanism and he cannot even imagine the possibility of the meaning of sucha comparison.2Most people believe that physicists are explaining the world. Some physicistseven believe that, but the Wu Li Masters know that they are only dancing withit. I asked Huang how he structures his classes.“Every lesson is the first lesson,” he told me. “Every time we dance, we do itfor the first time.”“But surely you cannot be starting new each lesson,” I said. “Lesson number twomust be built on what you taught in lesson number one, and lesson three likewisemust be built on lessons one and two, and so on.”“When I say that every lesson is the first lesson,” he replied, “it does notmean that we forget what we already know. It means that what we are doing isalways new, because we are always doing it for the first time.”This is another characteristic of a Master. Whatever he does, he does with theenthusiasm of doing it for the first time. This is the source of his unlimitedenergy. Every lesson that he teaches (or learns) is a first lesson. Every dancethat he dances, he dances for the first time. It is always new, personal, andalive.Isidor I. Rabi, Nobel Prize winner in Physics and the former Chairman of thePhysics Department at Columbia University, wrote:We don’t teach our students enough of the intellectual content ofexperiments—their novelty and their capacity for opening new fields…. My ownview is that you take these things personally. You do an experiment because yourown philosophy makes you want to know the result. It’s too hard, and life is tooshort, to spend your time doing something because someone else has said it’simportant. You must feel the thing yourself…3Unfortunately, most physicists are not like Rabi. The majority of them, in fact,do spend their lives doing what other people have told them is important. Thatwas the point Rabi was making.This brings us to a common misunderstanding. When most people say “scientist,”they mean “technician.” A technician is a highly trained person whose job is toapply known techniques and principles. He deals with the known. A scientist is aperson who seeks to know the true nature of physical reality. He deals with theunknown.In short, scientists discover and technicians apply. However, it is no longerevident whether scientists really discover new things or whether they createthem. Many people believe that “discovery” is actually an act of creation. Ifthis is so, then the distinction between scientists, poets, painters, andwriters is not clear. In fact, it is possible that scientists, poets, painters,and writers are all members of the same family of people whose gift it is bynature to take those things which we call commonplace and to re-present them tous in such ways that our self-imposed limitations are expanded. Those people inwhom this gift is especially pronounced, we call geniuses.The fact is that most “scientists” are technicians. They are not interested inthe essentially new. Their field of vision is relatively narrow; their energiesare directed toward applying what is already known. Because their noses oftenare buried in the bark of a particular tree, it is difficult to speakmeaningfully to them of forests. The case of the mysterious hydrogen spectrumillustrates the difference between scientists and technicians. When a white light, such as sunlight, enters a glass prism, one of the mostbeautiful of phenomena occurs. Out the other side of the prism comes not whitelight, but every color in the rainbow from dark red to light violet, withorange, yellow, green, and blue in between. This is because white light is madeof all these different colors. It is a combination, whereas red light containsonly red light, green light contains only green light, etc. Isaac Newton wrotehis famous Optiks about this phenomenon three hundred years ago. This display ofcolors is called a white-light spectrum. The spectral analysis of white lightshows a complete spectrum because white light contains all of the colors thatour eyes can see (and some that they cannot see, like infrared and ultraviolet).However, not every spectral analysis produces a complete spectrum. If we takeone of the chemical elements, for example, like sodium, cause it to emit light,and shine that light through a glass prism, we get only part of a completespectrum.If an object is visible in a dark room, it is emitting light. If it appears red,for example, it is emitting red light. Light is emitted by “excited” objects.Exciting a piece of sodium does not mean offering it tickets to the Super Bowl.Exciting a piece of sodium means adding some energy to it. One way of doing thisis to heat it. When we shine the light emitted by excited (incandescent) sodiumthrough a prism, or spectroscope, we do not obtain the full array of colorscharacteristic of white light, but only parts of it. In the case of sodium, weobtain two thin yellow lines.We also can produce a negative image of the sodium spectrum by shining whitelight through sodium vapor to see what parts of the white light the sodium vaporabsorbs. White light passing through sodium vapor and then through aspectroscope produces the whole rainbow of colors minus the two yellow linesemitted by incandescent sodium.Either way, the sodium spectrum always produces the same distinct pattern. Itmay be composed of black lines on an otherwise complete spectrum of colors, orit may be composed of colored lines without the rest of the spectrum, but italways remains the same.* [footnote1.html#fn01] This pattern is the fingerprintof the element sodium. Each element emits (or absorbs) only specific colors.Likewise, each element produces a specific spectroscopic pattern which nevervaries.Hydrogen is the simplest element. It seems to have only two components; aproton, which has a positive charge, and an electron, which has a negativecharge. We must say “it seems to have” because there is not one person alive whohas ever seen a hydrogen atom. If hydrogen atoms exist, millions of them canexist on a pinhead, so small are they calculated to be. “Hydrogen atoms” is aspeculation about what is inside of the watch. We can say only that theexistence of such entities nicely explains certain observations that would bevery difficult to explain otherwise, barring explanations such as “the devil didit,” which still may prove to be correct. (It is this kind of explanation thatdrove Galileo, Newton, and Descartes to create what is now modern science.)At one time physicists thought that atoms were constructed in the following way:At the center of an atom is a nucleus, just as the sun is at the center of oursolar system. In the nucleus is located almost all of the mass of the atom inthe form of positively charged particles (protons) and particles about the samesize as protons but without a charge (neutrons). (Only hydrogen has no neutronsin its nucleus.) Orbiting about the nucleus, as the planets orbit the sun, areelectrons, which have almost no mass compared with the nucleus. Each electronhas one negative charge. The number of electrons is always the same as thenumber of protons, so that the positive and negative charges cancel each otherand the atom, as a whole, has no charge.The problem with comparing this model of the atom with our solar system is thatthe distances between an atomic nucleus and its electrons are enormously greaterthan we picture the distances between the sun and its planets. The spaceoccupied by an atom is so huge, compared with the mass of its particles (almostall of which is in the nucleus), that the electrons orbiting the nucleus are“like a few flies in a cathedral” according to Ernest Rutherford, who createdthis model of the atom in 1911.This is the familiar picture of the atom that most of us learned in school,usually under duress. Unfortunately, this picture is obsolete, so you can forgetthe whole thing. We will discuss later how physicists currently think of anatom. The point here is that the planetary model of the atom formed thebackground against which a most puzzling problem was solved.The spectrum of hydrogen, the simplest of the atoms, contains over one hundredlines! The patterns of the other elements are even more complicated. When weshine the light from excited hydrogen gas through a spectroscope, we get overone hundred different lines of color in a distinct pattern.*[footnote2.html#fn02] The question is, “How can such a simple thing like ahydrogen atom, which has only two components, a proton and an electron, accountfor such a complex spectrum?”One way of thinking about light is to ascribe wave-like properties to it, andthen to say that different colors have different frequencies, just as differentsounds, which also are waves, have different frequencies. Arnold Sommerfield, aGerman physicist who also was an accomplished pianist, observed,tongue-in-cheek, that hydrogen atoms, which emit over one hundred differentfrequencies, must be more complicated than grand pianos, which emit onlyeighty-eight different frequencies!It was a Danish physicist named Niels Bohr who came up with an explanation (in1913) that made so much sense that it won him a Nobel Prize. Like most ideas inphysics, it is essentially simple. Bohr did not start with what wastheoretically “known” abut the structure of atoms. He started with what hereally knew about atoms, that is, he started with raw spectroscopic data. Bohrspeculated that electrons revolve around the nucleus of an atom not at just anydistance, but in orbits, or shells, which are specific distances from thenucleus. Each of these shells (theoretically there are an infinite number ofthem), contains up to a certain number of electrons, but no more.If the atom has more electrons than the first shell can accommodate, theelectrons begin to fill up the second shell. If the atom has more electrons thanthe first and second shells combined can hold, the third shell begins to fill,and so on, like this: Shell number 1 2 3 4 5… Numbers of electrons 2 8 18 32 50… His calculations were based on the hydrogen atom, which has only one electron.According to Bohr’s theory, the electron in the hydrogen atom stays as close tothe nucleus as it can get. In other words, it usually is in the first shell.This is the lowest energy state of a hydrogen atom. (Physicists call the lowestenergy state of any atom its “ground state.”) If we excite an atom of hydrogenwe cause its electron to jump to one of the outer shells. How far it jumpsdepends upon how much energy we give it. If we really heat the atom up (thermalenergy), we cause its electron to make a very large jump all the way to one ofthe outer shells. Smaller amounts of energy make the electron jump less far.However, as soon as it can (when we stop heating it), the electron returns to ashell closer in. Eventually it returns all the way back to shell number one.Whenever the electron jumps from an outer shell to an inner shell, it emitsenergy in the form of light. The energy that the electron emits is exactly theamount of energy that it absorbed when it jumped outward in the first place.Bohr discovered that all of the possible combinations of jumps that the hydrogenelectron can make on its journeys back to the ground state (the first shell)equals the number of lines in the hydrogen spectrum!This is Bohr’s famous solution to the grand-piano mystery. If the electron in ahydrogen atom travels from an outer shell all the way to the innermost shell inone jump, it gives off a certain amount of energy. That makes one line in thehydrogen spectrum. If the electron in a hydrogen atom makes a tiny jump from anouter shell to the next shell inward, it gives off a much smaller amount ofenergy. That makes another spectral line. If the electron in a hydrogen atomjumps from shell five to shell three, for example, that makes yet another line.A jump from shell six to shell four and then from shell four to shell one makestwo more spectral lines, and so on. In this way we can account for the entirehydrogen spectrum.If we excite a hydrogen atom with white light instead of heat, we can producethe absorption phenomenon that we mentioned earlier. Each electron jump from aninner shell to a shell farther out requires a certain amount of energy, no moreand no less. An electron jump from shell one to shell two requires a certainamount of energy, and only that amount. The same is true for a jump from shellfive to shell seven, etc. Each jump that the electron makes from an inner shellto an outer shell takes a specific amount of energy, no more and no less.When we shine white light on a hydrogen atom, we are offering it a wholesupermarket of different energy amounts. However, it cannot use all that we haveto offer; only certain specific amounts. If its electron jumps from shell one toshell four, for example, it takes that particular energy package out of thearray of energy packets that we are giving it. The package that it takes outbecomes a black line in the otherwise complete spectrum of white light. A jumpfrom shell three to shell four becomes another black line. A jump from shell oneto shell two, and then from shell two to shell six (there are all sorts ofcombinations) makes two more black lines.In sum, if we shine white light through hydrogen gas and then through a prism,the result is the familiar white-light spectrum, but with over one hundred blacklines in it. Each of these black lines corresponds to a specific energy amountthat was required to make a hydrogen electron jump from one shell to anothershell farther out.These black lines in the white-light spectrum form exactly the same pattern thatwe get when we shine the light emitted from excited hydrogen gas directlythrough a prism—except, in that case, the lines are colored and the rest of thewhite-light spectrum is missing. Of course, the colored lines are caused by theelectrons returning to lower-level shells and, in the process, emitting energyamounts equal to what they absorbed when we first made them jump. Bohr’s theorypermitted physicists to calculate the frequencies of the light given off bysimple hydrogen atoms. These calculations agreed with observations. Thegrand-piano mystery was solved!Shortly after Bohr published his theory in 1913, an army of physicists began thework of applying it to the other elements. This process was quite complicatedfor atoms with large numbers of electrons, and not all of the questions thatphysicists had about the nature of atomic phenomena were answered. Nonetheless,a tremendous amount of knowledge was gained from this work. Most of thephysicists who went to work on Bohr’s theory, applying it and further developingit, were technicians. Bohr himself, one of the founders of the new physics, wasa scientist.This is not to say that technicians are not important. The technician and thescientist form a partnership. Bohr could not have formulated his theory withoutthe wealth of spectroscopic data at his disposal. That data was the result ofcountless laboratory hours. It was beyond Bohr’s capacity, as one person, tosubstantiate his theory. Technicians did this for him by applying it to theother elements. Technicians are important members of the scientific community.However, since this is a book about Wu Li Masters and not about technicians, wewill use the word “physicist” from now on to mean those physicists who are alsoscientists, that is, those physicists (people) who are not confined by the“known.” From the little that we know about Wu Li Masters, it is evident thatthey come from this group. There are certain limitations which no book on physics can overcome. First,there is so much to present that not even twenty volumes could contain it all.There is that much new material published each year. Even physicists find itimpossible to keep abreast of the whole field. It requires a steady diet ofreading just to keep current in one area. For everything that is included inthese pages, there is much more that is not. No matter how much you learn aboutphysics, there always will be something that is new to you. Physicists have thisproblem, too.Second, no complete appreciation of physics is possible without mathematics.Nonetheless, there is no mathematics in The Dancing Wu Li Masters. Mathematicsis a highly structured way of thinking. Physicists view the world in this way.One point of view is that they impose this structure on what they see. Anotherpoint of view is that the world presents itself most completely through suchstructures. In any case, mathematics is the most concise expression of physics.The reason for writing The Dancing Wu Li Masters, however, is that mostphysicists are not able to explain physics very well without it. This makes themvery concise but, unfortunately, unintelligible. The fact is that most of us usewords to do our explaining.However, it is important to remember that mathematics and English are bothlanguages. Languages are useful tools for conveying information, but if we tryto communicate experiences with them, they simply do not work. All a languagecan do is talk about an experience. Wu Li Masters know that a description of anexperience is not the experience. It is only talk about it.This is a book about physics. Therefore, all it contains is a description. Itcannot contain the experience itself. This does not mean that you will not havethe experience of physics by reading it; it only means that if you do, theexperience is coming from you, and not from the book. Quantum mechanics, forexample, shows us that we are not as separate from the rest of the world as weonce thought. Particle physics shows us that the “rest of the world” does notsit idly “out there.” It is a sparkling realm of continual creation,transformation, and annihilation. The ideas of the new physics, when whollygrasped, can produce extraordinary experiences. The study of relativity theory,for example, can produce the remarkable experience that space and time are onlymental constructions! Each of these different experiences is capable of changingus in such ways that we never again are able to view the world as we did before.There is no single “experience” of physics. The experience always is changing.Relativity and quantum mechanics, although generally unknown to nonphysicists,are more than a half century old. Today, the entire field of physics isquivering with anticipation. The air is charged with excitement. A feeling isshared among physicists that radical change is at hand. A consensus grows thatthe near future will see new theories exploding onto the scene, incorporatingthe older theories and giving us a much larger view of our universe and,consequently, of ourselves.The Wu Li Masters move in the midst of all this, now dancing this way, now that,sometimes with a heavy beat, sometimes with a lightness and grace, ever flowingfreely. Now they become the dance, now the dance becomes them. This is themessage of the Wu Li Masters: not to confuse the type of dance that they aredoing with the fact that they are dancing."},{"pageContent":"1EINSTEIN DOESN’T LIKE IT [dancingwulimastersthe_con01.html#ch_02]Quantum mechanics are not the fellows who repair automobiles in Mr. Quantum’sgarage. Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics. There are several branches ofphysics. Most physicists believe that sooner or later they will construct anoverview large enough to incorporate them all.According to this point of view, we eventually will develop, in principle, atheory which is capable of explaining everything so well that there will benothing left to explain. This does not mean, of course, that our explanationnecessarily will reflect the way that things actually are. We still will not beable to open the watch, as Einstein put it, but every occurrence in the realworld (inside the watch) will be accounted for by a corresponding element of ourfinal supertheory. We will have, at last, a theory that is consistent withinitself and which explains all observable phenomena. Einstein called this statethe “ideal limit of knowledge.”1This way of thinking runs into quantum mechanics the same way that the car runsinto the proverbial brick wall. Einstein spent a large portion of his careerarguing against quantum mechanics, even though he himself made majorcontributions to its development. Why did he do this? To ask this question is tostand at the edge of an abyss, still on the solid ground of Newtonian physics,but looking into the void. To answer it is to leap boldly into the new physics. Quantum mechanics forced itself upon the scene at the beginning of this century.No convention of physicists voted to start a new branch of physics called“quantum mechanics.” No one had any choice in the matter, except, perhaps, whatto call it.A “quantum” is a quantity of something, a specific amount. “Mechanics” is thestudy of motion. Therefore, “quantum mechanics” is the study of the motion ofquantities. Quantum theory says that nature comes in bits and pieces (quanta),and quantum mechanics is the study of this phenomenon.Quantum mechanics does not replace Newtonian physics, it includes it. Thephysics of Newton remains valid within its limits. To say that we have made amajor new discovery about nature is one side of a coin. The other side of thecoin is to say that we have found the limits of our previous theories. What weactually discover is that the way that we have been looking at nature is nolonger comprehensive enough to explain all that we can observe, and we areforced to develop a more inclusive view. In Einstein’s words:…creating a new theory is not like destroying an old barn and erecting askyscraper in its place. It is rather like climbing a mountain, gaining new andwider views, discovering unexpected connections between our starting point andits rich environment. But the point from which we started out still exists andcan be seen, although it appears smaller and forms a tiny part of our broad viewgained by the mastery of the obstacles on our adventurous way up.2Newtonian physics still is applicable to the large-scale world, but it does notwork in the subatomic realm. Quantum mechanics resulted from the study of thesubatomic realm, that invisible universe underlying, embedded in, and formingthe fabric of everything around us.In Newton’s age (late 1600s), this realm was entirely speculation. The idea thatthe atom is the indivisible building block of nature was proposed about fourhundred years before Christ, but until the late 1800s it remained just an idea.Then physicists developed the technology to observe the effects of atomicphenomena, thereby “proving” that atoms exist. Of course, what they reallyproved was that the theoretical existence of atoms was the best explanation ofthe experimental data that anyone could invent at the time. They also provedthat atoms are not indivisible, but themselves are made of particles smalleryet, such as electrons, protons, and neutrons. These new particles were labeled“elementary particles” because physicists believed that, at last, they reallyhad discovered the ultimate building blocks of the universe.The elementary particle theory is a recent version of an old Greek idea. Tounderstand the theory of elementary particles, imagine a large city madeentirely of bricks. This city is filled with buildings of all shapes and sizes.Every one of them, and the streets as well, have been constructed with only afew different types of brick. If we substitute “universe” for “city” and“particle” for “brick,” we have the theory of elementary particles.It was the study of elementary particles that brought physicists nose to nosewith the most devastating (to a physicist) discovery: Newtonian physics does notwork in the realm of the very small! The impact of that earthshaking discoverystill is reshaping our world view. Quantum mechanical experiments repeatedlyproduced results which the physics of Newton could neither predict nor explain.Yet, although Newton’s physics could not account for phenomena in themicroscopic realm, it continued to explain macroscopic phenomena very well (eventhough the macroscopic is made of the microscopic)! This was perhaps the mostprofound discovery of science.Newton’s laws are based upon observations of the everyday world. They predictevents. These events pertain to real things like baseballs and bicycles. Quantummechanics is based upon experiments conducted in the subatomic realm. Itpredicts probabilities. These probabilities pertain to subatomic phenomena.Subatomic phenomena cannot be observed directly. None of our senses can detectthem.* [footnote3.html#fn03] Not only has no one ever seen an atom (much less anelectron), no one has ever tasted, touched, heard, or smelled one either.Newton’s laws depict events which are simple to understand and easy to picture.Quantum mechanics depicts the probabilities of phenomena which defyconceptualization and are impossible to visualize. Therefore, these phenomenamust be understood in a way that is not more difficult than our usual way ofunderstanding, but different from it. Do not try to make a complete mentalpicture of quantum mechanical events. (Physicists make partial pictures ofquantum phenomena, but even these pictures have a questionable value.) Instead,allow yourself to be open without making an effort to visualize anything. WernerHeisenberg, one of the founders of quantum physics, wrote:The mathematically formulated laws of quantum theory show clearly that ourordinary intuitive concepts cannot be unambiguously applied to the smallestparticles. All the words or concepts we use to describe ordinary physicalobjects, such as position, velocity, color, size, and so on, become indefiniteand problematic if we try to use them of elementary particles.3The idea that we do not understand something until we have a picture of it inour heads is a by-product of the Newtonian way of looking at the world. If wewant to get past Newton, we have to get past that. Newton’s first great contribution to science was the laws of motion. If anobject, said Newton, is moving in a straight line, it will continue moving in astraight line forever unless it is acted upon by something else (a “force”). Atthat time its direction and speed will be altered, depending upon the magnitudeand direction of the force which it encounters. Furthermore, every action isaccompanied by an equal and opposite reaction.Today, these concepts are familiar to anyone who has studied physics or hung outin a pool hall. However, if we mentally project ourselves three hundred yearsinto the past, we can see how remarkable they really are.First, Newton’s first law of motion defied the accepted authority of the day,which was Aristotle. According to Aristotle, the natural inclination for amoving object is to return to a state of rest.Second, Newton’s laws of motion describe events which were unobservable in the1600s. In the everyday world, which was all that Newton had to observe, movingobjects always do return to a state of rest because of friction. If we put awagon in motion, it encounters friction from the air through which it passes,from the ground its tires move on, from the axles that its wheels turn around,and, unless it is rolling downhill, sooner or later it comes to rest. We canstreamline the wagon, grease the wheels, and use a smooth road, but this onlyreduces the effect of friction. Eventually the wagon stops moving, apparently onits own.Newton never had the chance to see a film of astronauts in space, but hepredicted what they would encounter. When an astronaut releases a pencil infront of him, nothing happens. It just stays there. If he gives it a push, offit goes in the direction of the push until it bumps into a wall. If the wallwere not there, the pencil would continue to move uniformly, in principle,forever. (The astronaut also moves off in the opposite direction, but much moreslowly because of his greater mass.)Third, Newton’s premise was “I make no hypotheses” (“Hypotheses non fingo”),which means that he based his laws upon sound experimental evidence, and nothingelse. His criteria for the validity of everything that he wrote was that anyoneshould be able to reproduce his experiments and come up with the same results.If it could be verified experimentally, it was true. If it could not be verifiedexperimentally, it was suspect.The church took a dim view, to say the least, of this position. Since it hadbeen saying things for fifteen hundred years which hardly were subject toexperimental verification, Newtonian physics, in effect, was a direct challengeto the power of the church. The power of the church was considerable.*[footnote4.html#fn04] Shortly before Newton’s birth, Galileo was seized by theInquisition for declaring that the earth revolves around the sun and for drawingunacceptable theological implications from his beliefs. He was forced to recanton penalty of imprisonment or worse. This made a considerable impression on manypeople, among them another founder of modern science, the Frenchman RenéDescartes.In the 1630s Descartes visited the royal gardens at Versailles, which were knownfor their intricate automata. When water was made to flow, music sounded, seanymphs began to play, and a giant Neptune, complete with trident, advancedmenacingly. Whether the idea was in his mind before this visit or not,Descartes’s philosophy, which he supported with his mathematics, became that theuniverse and all of the things in it also were automata. From Descartes’s timeto the beginning of this century, and perhaps because of him, our ancestorsbegan to see the universe as a Great Machine. Over the next three hundred yearsthey developed science specifically to discover how the Great Machine worked.Newton’s second great contribution to science was his law of gravity. Gravity isa remarkable phenomenon, even though we take it for granted. For example, if wehold a ball off the ground, and then release it, the ball falls straight down tothe ground. But how did that happen? The ground did not reach up and pull theball down, yet the ball was pulled to the earth. The old physics called thisunexplainable phenomenon “action-at-a-distance.” Newton himself was as puzzledas anyone. He wrote in his famous Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica:…I have not been able to discover the cause of those properties of gravity fromphenomena, and I frame no hypotheses…it is enough that gravity does reallyexist, and act according to the laws which we have explained, and abundantlyserves to account for all the motions of the celestial bodies…4Newton clearly felt that a true understanding of the nature of gravity wasbeyond comprehension. In a letter to Richard Bently, a classical scholar, hewrote:…that one body may act upon another at a distance through a vacuum without themediation of anything else, by and through which their action and force may beconveyed from one to another, is to me so great an absurdity that, I believe, noman who has in philosophic matters a competent faculty of thinking could everfall into it.5In short, action-at-a-distance could be described, but it could not beexplained.Newton’s thesis was that the same force which pulls apples downward also keepsthe moon in orbit around the earth and the planets in orbit around the sun. Totest his idea, he calculated various movements of the moon and the planets,using his own mathematics. Then he compared his findings with the observationsof astronomers. His calculations and their observations matched! In one strokeNewton set aside the assumption of an essential difference between earthly andheavenly objects by showing that both of them are governed by the same laws. Heestablished a rational celestial mechanics. What had been the purview of thegods, or God, came now within the comprehension of mortals. Newton’sgravitational law does not explain gravity (that was done by Einstein in hisgeneral theory of relativity) but it does subject the effects of gravity to arigorous mathematical formalism.Newton was the first person to discover principles in nature which unify largetracts of experience. He abstracted certain unifying concepts from the endlessdiversity of nature and gave those concepts mathematical expression. Because ofthis, more than anything else, Newton’s work has influenced us so forcefully.Newton showed us that the phenomena of the universe are structured in rationallycomprehensible ways. He gave us the most powerful tool in history. In the Westwe have used this tool, if not wisely, certainly to the best of our ability. Theresults, both positive and negative, have been spectacular. The story of ourenormous impact on our environment begins with the work of Newton.It was Galileo Galilei who, following the Middle Ages, first quantified thephysical world. He measured the motion, frequency, velocity, and duration ofeverything from falling stones to swinging pendulums (like the chandelier in hiscathedral). It was René Descartes who developed many of the fundamentaltechniques of modern mathematics and gave us the picture of the universe as aGreat Machine. It was Isaac Newton who formulated the laws by which the GreatMachine runs.These men struck boldly against the grip of scholasticism, the medieval thoughtsystem of the 12th to the 15th centuries. They attempted to place “man” at thecenter of the stage, or at least back on the stage; to prove to him that he neednot be a bystander in a world governed by unfathomable forces. It is perhaps thegreatest irony of history that they accomplished just the opposite.Joseph Weizenbaum, a scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,wrote, in reference to computers:Science promised man power…. But, as so often happens when people are seduced bypromises of power, the price is servitude and impotence. Power is nothing if itis not the power to choose.6How did this happen?Newton’s laws of motion describe what happens to a moving object. Once we knowthe laws of motion we can predict the future of a moving object provided that weknow certain things about it initially. The more initial information that wehave, the more accurate our predictions will be. We also can retrodict (predictbackward in time) the past history of a given object. For example, if we knowthe present position and velocity of the earth, the moon, and the sun, we canpredict where the earth will be in relation to the moon and the sun at anyparticular time in the future, giving us a foreknowledge of eclipses, seasons,and so on. In like manner, we can calculate where the earth has been in relationto the moon and the sun, and when similar phenomena occurred in the past.Without Newtonian physics the space program would not be possible. Moon probesare launched at the precise moment when the launch site on the earth (whichsimultaneously is rotating around its axis and moving forward through space) isin a position, relative to the landing zone on the moon (which also is rotatingand moving) such that the path traversed by the spacecraft is the shortestpossible. The calculations of the earth, moon, and spacecraft movements are doneby computer, but the mechanics used are the same ones that are described inNewton’s Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica.In practice, it is very difficult to know all the initial circumstancespertaining to an event. Even a simple action such as bouncing a ball off a wallis surprisingly complex. The shape, size, elasticity, and momentum of the ball,the angle at which it was thrown, the density, pressure, humidity andtemperature of the air, the shape, hardness, and position of the wall, to name afew of the essential elements, are all required to know where and when the ballwill land. It is increasingly difficult to obtain all of the data necessary foraccurate predictions when more complex actions are involved. According to theold physics, however, it is possible, in principle, to predict exactly how agiven event is going to unfold if we have enough information about it. Inpractice, it is only the enormity of the task that prevents us fromaccomplishing it.The ability to predict the future based on a knowledge of the present and thelaws of motion gave our ancestors a power they had never known. However, theseconcepts carry within them a very dispiriting logic. If the laws of naturedetermine the future of an event, then, given enough information, we could havepredicted our present at some time in the past. That time in the past also couldhave been predicted at a time still earlier. In short, if we are to accept themechanistic determination of Newtonian physics—if the universe really is a greatmachine—then from the moment that the universe was created and set into motion,everything that was to happen in it already was determined.According to this philosophy, we may seem to have a will of our own and theability to alter the course of events in our lives, but we do not. Everything,from the beginning of time, has been predetermined, including our illusion ofhaving a free will. The universe is a prerecorded tape playing itself out in theonly way that it can. The status of men is immeasurably more dismal than it wasbefore the advent of science. The Great Machine runs blindly on, and all thingsin it are but cogs.According to quantum mechanics, however, it is not possible, even in principle,to know enough about the present to make a complete prediction about the future.Even if we have the best possible measuring devices, it is not possible. It isnot a matter of the size of the task or the inefficiency of detectors. The verynature of things is such that we must choose which aspect of them we wish toknow best, for we can know only one of them with precision.As Niels Bohr, another founder of quantum mechanics, put it:…in quantum mechanics, we are not dealing with an arbitrary renunciation of amore detailed analysis of atomic phenomena, but with a recognition that such ananalysis is in principle excluded.7 [Italics in the original]For example, imagine an object moving through space. It has both a position anda momentum which we can measure. This is an example of the old (Newtonian)physics. (Momentum is a combination of how big an object is, how fast it isgoing, and the direction that it is moving.) Since we can determine both theposition and the momentum of the object at a particular time, it is not a verydifficult affair to calculate where it will be at some point in the future. Ifwe see an airplane flying north at two hundred miles per hour, we know that inone hour it will be two hundred miles farther north if it does not change itscourse or speed.The mind-expanding discovery of quantum mechanics is that Newtonian physics doesnot apply to subatomic phenomena. In the subatomic realm, we cannot know boththe position and the momentum of a particle with absolute precision. We can knowboth, approximately, but the more we know about one, the less we know about theother. We can know either of them precisely, but in that case, we can knownothing about the other. This is Werner Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. Asincredible as it seems, it has been verified repeatedly by experiment.Of course, if we picture a moving particle, it is very difficult to imagine notbeing able to measure both its position and momentum. Not to be able to do sodefies our “common sense.” This is not the only quantum mechanical phenomenonwhich contradicts common sense. Commonsense contradictions, in fact, are at theheart of the new physics. They tell us again and again that the world may not bewhat we think it is. It may be much, much more.Since we cannot determine both the position and momentum of subatomic particles,we cannot predict much about them. Accordingly, quantum mechanics does not andcannot predict specific events. It does, however, predict probabilities.Probabilities are the odds that something is going to happen, or that it is notgoing to happen. Quantum theory can predict the probability of a microscopicevent with the same precision that Newtonian physics can predict the actualoccurrence of a macroscopic event.Newtonian physics says, “If such and such is the case now, then such and such isgoing to happen next.” Quantum mechanics says, “If such and such is the casenow, then the probability that such and such is going to happen nextis…(whatever it is calculated to be).” We never can know with certainty whatwill happen to the particle that we are “observing.” All that we can know forsure are the probabilities for it to behave in certain ways. This is the mostthat we can know because the two data which must be included in a Newtoniancalculation, position and momentum, cannot both be known with precision. We mustchoose, by the selection of our experiment, which one we want to measure mostaccurately.The lesson of Newtonian physics is that the universe is governed by laws thatare susceptible to rational understanding. By applying these laws we extend ourknowledge of, and therefore our influence over, our environment. Newton was areligious person. He saw his laws as manifestations of God’s perfection.Nonetheless, Newton’s laws served man’s cause well. They enhanced his dignityand vindicated his importance in the universe. Following the Middle Ages, thenew field of science (“Natural Philosophy”) came like a fresh breeze torevitalize the spirit. It is ironic that, in the end, Natural Philosophy reducedthe status of men to that of helpless cogs in a machine whose functioning hadbeen preordained from the day of its creation.Contrary to Newtonian physics, quantum mechanics tells us that our knowledge ofwhat governs events on the subatomic level is not nearly what we assumed itwould be. It tells us that we cannot predict subatomic phenomena with anycertainty. We only can predict their probabilities.Philosophically, however, the implications of quantum mechanics are psychedelic.Not only do we influence our reality, but, in some degree, we actually createit. Because it is the nature of things that we can know either the momentum of aparticle or its position, but not both, we must choose which of these twoproperties we want to determine. Metaphysically, this is very close to sayingthat we create certain properties because we choose to measure those properties.Said another way, it is possible that we create something that has position, forexample, like a particle, because we are intent on determining position and itis impossible to determine position without having some thing occupying theposition that we want to determine.Quantum physicists ponder questions like, “Did a particle with momentum existbefore we conducted an experiment to measure its momentum?”; “Did a particlewith position exist before we conducted an experiment to measure its position?”;and “Did any particles exist at all before we thought about them and measuredthem?” “Did we create the particles that we are experimenting with?” Incredibleas it sounds, this is a possibility that many physicists recognize.John Wheeler, a well-known physicist at Princeton, wrote:May the universe in some strange sense be “brought into being” by theparticipation of those who participate?…The vital act is the act ofparticipation. “Participator” is the incontrovertible new concept given byquantum mechanics. It strikes down the term “observer” of classical theory, theman who stands safely behind the thick glass wall and watches what goes onwithout taking part. It can’t be done, quantum mechanics says.8The languages of eastern mystics and western physicists are becoming verysimilar.Newtonian physics and quantum mechanics are partners in a double irony.Newtonian physics is based upon the idea of laws which govern phenomena and thepower inherent in understanding them, but it leads to impotence in the face of aGreat Machine which is the universe. Quantum mechanics is based upon the idea ofminimal knowledge of future phenomena (we are limited to knowing probabilities)but it leads to the possibility that our reality is what we choose to make it. There is another fundamental difference between the old physics and the newphysics. The old physics assumes that there is an external world which existsapart from us. It further assumes that we can observe, measure, and speculateabout the external world without changing it. According to the old physics, theexternal world is indifferent to us and to our needs.Galileo’s historical stature stems from his tireless (and successful) efforts toquantify (measure) the phenomena of the external world. There is great powerinherent in the process of quantification. For example, once a relationship isdiscovered, like the rate of acceleration of a falling object, it matters notwho drops the object, what object is dropped, or where the dropping takes place.The results are always the same. An experimenter in Italy gets the same resultsas a Russian experimenter who repeats the experiment a century later. Theresults are the same whether the experiment is done by a skeptic, a believer, ora curious bystander.Facts like these convinced philosophers that the physical universe goesunheedingly on its way, doing what it must, without regard for its inhabitants.For example, if we simultaneously drop two people from the same height, it is averifiable (repeatable) fact that they both will hit the ground at the sametime, regardless of their weights. We can measure their fall, acceleration, andimpact the same way that we measure the fall, acceleration, and impact ofstones. In fact, the results will be the same as if they were stones.“But there is a difference between people and stones!” you might say. “Stoneshave no opinions or emotions. People have both. One of these dropped people, forexample, might be frightened by his experience and the other might be angry.Don’t their feelings have any importance in this scheme?”No. The feelings of our subjects matter not in the least. When we take them upthe tower again (struggling this time) and drop them off again, they fall withthe same acceleration and duration that they did the first time, even thoughnow, of course, they are both fighting mad. The Great Machine is impersonal. Infact, it was precisely this impersonality that inspired scientists to strive for“absolute objectivity.”The concept of scientific objectivity rests upon the assumption of an externalworld which is “out there” as opposed to an “I” which is “in here.” (This way ofperceiving, which puts other people “out there,” makes it very lonely “inhere.”) According to this view, Nature, in all her diversity, is “out there.”The task of the scientist is to observe the “out there” as objectively aspossible. To observe something objectively means to see it as it would appear toan observer who has no prejudices about what he observes.The problem that went unnoticed for three centuries is that a person who carriessuch an attitude certainly is prejudiced. His prejudice is to be “objective,”that is, to be without a preformed opinion. In fact, it is impossible to bewithout an opinion. An opinion is a point of view. The point of view that we canbe without a point of view is a point of view. The decision itself to study onesegment of reality instead of another is a subjective expression of theresearcher who makes it. It affects his perceptions of reality, if nothing else.Since reality is what we are studying, the matter gets very sticky here.The new physics, quantum mechanics, tells us clearly that it is not possible toobserve reality without changing it. If we observe a certain particle collisionexperiment, not only do we have no way of proving that the result would havebeen the same if we had not been watching it, all that we know indicates that itwould not have been the same, because the result that we got was affected by thefact that we were looking for it.Some experiments show that light is wave-like. Other experiments show equallywell that light is particle-like. If we want to demonstrate that light is aparticle-like phenomenon or that light is a wave-like phenomenon, we only needto select the appropriate experiment.According to quantum mechanics there is no such thing as objectivity. We cannoteliminate ourselves from the picture. We are a part of nature, and when we studynature there is no way around the fact that nature is studying itself. Physicshas become a branch of psychology, or perhaps the other way round.Carl Jung, the Swiss psychologist, wrote:The psychological rule says that when an inner situation is not made conscious,it happens outside, as fate. That is to say, when the individual remainsundivided and does not become conscious of his inner contradictions, the worldmust perforce act out the conflict and be torn into opposite halves.9Jung’s friend, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist, Wolfgang Pauli, put it thisway:From an inner center the psyche seems to move outward, in the sense of anextraversion, into the physical world…10If these men are correct, then physics is the study of the structure ofconsciousness. The descent downward from the macroscopic level to the microscopic level, whichwe have been calling the realm of the very small, is a two-step process. Thefirst step downward is to the atomic level. The second step downward is to thesubatomic level.The smallest object that we can see, even under a microscope, contains millionsof atoms. To see the atoms in a baseball, we would have to make the baseball thesize of the earth. If a baseball were the size of the earth, its atoms would beabout the size of grapes. If you can picture the earth as a huge glass ballfilled with grapes, that is approximately how a baseball full of atoms wouldlook.The step downward from the atomic level takes us to the subatomic level. Here wefind the particles that make up atoms. The difference between the atomic leveland the subatomic level is as great as the difference between the atomic leveland the world of sticks and rocks. It would be impossible to see the nucleus ofan atom the size of a grape. In fact, it would be impossible to see the nucleusof an atom the size of a room. To see the nucleus of an atom, the atom wouldhave to be as high as a fourteen-story building! The nucleus of an atom as highas a fourteen-story building would be about the size of a grain of salt. Since anuclear particle has about 2,000 times more mass than an electron, the electronsrevolving around this nucleus would be about as massive as dust particles!The dome of Saint Peter’s basilica in the Vatican has a diameter of aboutfourteen stories. Imagine a grain of salt in the middle of the dome of SaintPeter’s with a few dust particles revolving around it at the outer edges of thedome. This gives us the scale of subatomic particles. It is in this realm, thesubatomic realm, that Newtonian physics has proven inadequate, and that quantummechanics is required to explain particle behavior.A subatomic particle is not a “particle” like a dust particle. There is morethan a difference in size between a dust particle and a subatomic particle. Adust particle is a thing, an object. A subatomic particle cannot be pictured asa thing. Therefore, we must abandon the idea of a subatomic particle as anobject.Quantum mechanics views subatomic particles as “tendencies to exist” or“tendencies to happen.” How strong these tendencies are is expressed in terms ofprobabilities. A subatomic particle is a “quantum,” which means a quantity ofsomething. What that something is, however, is a matter of speculation. Manyphysicists feel that it is not meaningful even to pose the question. It may bethat the search for the ultimate “stuff” of the universe is a crusade for anillusion. At the subatomic level, mass and energy change unceasingly into eachother. Particle physicists are so familiar with the phenomena of mass becomingenergy and energy becoming mass that they routinely measure the mass ofparticles in energy units.* [footnote5.html#fn05] Since the tendencies ofsubatomic phenomena to become manifest under certain conditions areprobabilities, this brings us to the matter (no pun) of statistics. Because there are millions of millions of subatomic particles in the smallestspace that we can see, it is convenient to deal with them statistically.Statistical descriptions are pictures of crowd behavior. Statistics cannot tellus how one individual in a crowd will behave, but they can give us a fairlyaccurate description, based on repeated observations, of how a group as a wholebehaves.For example, a statistical study of population growth may tell us how manychildren were born in each of several years and how many are predicted to beborn in years to come. However, the statistics cannot tell us which familieswill have the new children and which ones will not. If we want to know thebehavior of traffic at an intersection, we can install devices there to gatherdata. The statistics that these devices provide may tell us how many cars, forinstance, turn left during certain hours, but not which cars.Statistics is used in Newtonian physics. It is used, for example, to explain therelationship between gas volume and pressure. This relation is named Boyle’s Lawafter its discoverer, Robert Boyle, who lived in Newton’s time. It could aseasily be known as the Bicycle Pump Law, as we shall see. Boyle’s Law says thatif the volume of a container holding a given amount of gas at a constanttemperature is reduced by one half, the pressure exerted by the gas in thecontainer doubles.Imagine a person with a bicycle pump. He has pulled the plunger fully upward,and is about ready to push it down. The hose of the pump is connected to apressure gauge instead of to a bicycle tire, so that we can see how muchpressure is in the pump. Since there is no pressure on the plunger, there is nopressure in the pump cylinder and the gauge reads zero. However, the pressureinside the pump is not actually zero. We live at the bottom of an ocean of air(our atmosphere). The weight of the several miles of air above us exerts apressure at sea level of 14.7 pounds on every square inch of our bodies. Ourbodies do not collapse because they are exerting 14.7 pounds per square inchoutward. This is the state that we usually read as zero on a bicycle pressuregauge. To be accurate, suppose that we set our gauge to read 14.7 pounds persquare inch before we push down on the pump handle.Now we push the piston down halfway. The interior volume of the pump cylinder isnow one half of its original size, and no air has been allowed to escape,because the hose is connected to a pressure gauge. The gauge now reads 29.4pounds per square inch, or twice the original pressure. Next we push the plungertwo thirds of the way down. The interior volume of the pump cylinder is now onethird of its original size, and the pressure gauge reads three times theoriginal pressure (44.1 pounds per square inch). This is Boyle’s Law: At aconstant temperature the pressure of a quantity of gas is inversely proportionalto its volume. If the volume is reduced to one half, the pressure doubles; ifthe volume is reduced to one third, the pressure triples, etc. To explain whythis is so, we come to classical statistics.The air (a gas) in our pump is composed of millions of molecules (molecules aremade of atoms). These molecules are in constant motion, and at any given time,millions of them are banging into the pump walls. Although we do not detect eachsingle collision, the macroscopic effect of these millions of impacts on asquare inch of the pump wall produces the phenomenon of “pressure” on it. If wereduce the volume of the pump cylinder by one half, we crowd the gas moleculesinto a space twice as small as the original one, thereby causing twice as manyimpacts on the same square inch of pump wall. The macroscopic effect of this isa doubling of the “pressure.” By crowding the molecules into one third of theoriginal space, we cause three times as many molecules to bang into the samesquare inch of pump wall, and the “pressure” on it triples. This is the kinetictheory of gases.In other words, “pressure” results from the group behavior of a large number ofmolecules in motion. It is a collection of individual events. Each individualevent can be analyzed because, according to Newtonian physics, each individualevent is theoretically subject to deterministic laws. In principle, we cancalculate the path of each molecule in the pump chamber. This is how statisticsis used in the old physics.Quantum mechanics also used statistics, but there is a very big differencebetween quantum mechanics and Newtonian physics. In quantum mechanics, there isno way to predict individual events. This is the startling lesson thatexperiments in the subatomic realm have taught us.Therefore, quantum mechanics concerns itself only with group behavior. Itintentionally leaves vague the relation between group behavior and individualevents because individual subatomic events cannot be determined accurately (theuncertainty principle) and, as we shall see in high-energy particles, theyconstantly are changing. Quantum physics abandons the laws which governindividual events and states directly the statistical laws which governcollections of events. Quantum mechanics can tell us how a group of particleswill behave, but the only thing that it can say about an individual particle ishow it probably will behave. Probability is one of the major characteristics ofquantum mechanics.This makes quantum mechanics an ideal tool for dealing with subatomic phenomena.For example, take the phenomenon of common radioactive decay (luminous watchdials). Radioactive decay is a phenomenon of predictable overall behaviorconsisting of unpredictable individual events.Suppose that we put one gram of radium in a time vault and leave it there forsixteen hundred years. When we return, do we find one gram of radium? No! Wefind only half a gram. This is because radium atoms naturally disintegrate at arate such that every sixteen hundred years half of them are gone. Therefore,physicists say that radium has a “half life” of sixteen hundred years. If we putthe radium back in the vault for another sixteen hundred years, only one fourthof the original gram would remain when we opened the vault again. Every sixteenhundred years one half of all the radium atoms in the world disappear. How do weknow which radium atoms are going to disintegrate and which radium atoms are notgoing to disintegrate?We don’t. We can predict how many atoms in a piece of radium are going todisintegrate in the next hour, but we have no way of determining which ones aregoing to disintegrate. There is no physical law that we know of which governsthis selection. Which atoms decay is purely a matter of chance. Nonetheless,radium continues to decay, on schedule, as it were, with a precise and unvaryinghalf life of sixteen hundred years. Quantum theory dispenses with the lawsgoverning the disintegration of individual radium atoms and proceeds directly tothe statistical laws governing the disintegration of radium atoms as a group.This is how statistics is used in the new physics.Another good example of predictable overall (statistical) behavior consisting ofunpredictable individual events is the constant variation of intensity amongspectral lines. Remember that, according to Bohr’s theory, the electrons of anatom are located only in shells which are specific distances from the nucleus.Normally, the single electron of a hydrogen atom remains in the shell closest tothe nucleus (the ground state). If we excite it (add energy to it) we cause itto jump to a shell farther out. The more energy we give it, the farther out itjumps. If we stop exciting it, the electron jumps inward to a shell closer tothe nucleus, eventually returning all the way to the innermost shell. With eachjump from an outer shell to an inner shell, the electron emits an energy amountequal to the energy amount that it absorbed when we caused it to jump outward.These emitted energy packets (photons) constitute the light which, whendispersed through a prism, forms the spectrum of one hundred or so colored linesthat is peculiar to hydrogen. Each colored line in the hydrogen spectrum is madefrom the light emitted from hydrogen electrons as they jump from a particularouter shell to a particular inner shell.What we did not mention earlier is that some of the lines in the hydrogenspectrum are more pronounced than others. The lines that are more pronounced arealways more pronounced and the lines that are faint are always faint. Theintensity of the lines in the hydrogen spectrum varies because hydrogenelectrons returning to the ground state do not always take the same route.Shell five, for example, may be a more popular stopover than shell three. Inthat case, the spectrum produced by millions of excited hydrogen atoms will showa more pronounced spectral line corresponding to electron jumps from shell fiveto shell one and a less pronounced spectral line corresponding to electron jumpsfrom, say, shell three to shell one. That is because, in this example, moreelectrons stop over at shell five before jumping to shell one than stop over atshell three before jumping to shell one.In other words, the probability is very high, in this example, that theelectrons of excited hydrogen atoms will stop at shell five on their way back toshell one, and the probability is lower that they will stop at shell three. Saidanother way, we know that a certain number of electrons probably will stop atshell five and that a certain lesser number of electrons probably will stop atshell three. Still, we have no way of knowing which electrons will stop where.As before, we can describe precisely an overall behavior without being able topredict a single one of the individual events which comprise it. This brings us to the central philosophical issue of quantum mechanics, namely,“What is it that quantum mechanics describes?” Put another way, quantummechanics statistically describes the overall behavior and/or predicts theprobabilities of the individual behavior of what?In the autumn of 1927, physicists working with the new physics met in Brussels,Belgium, to ask themselves this question, among others. What they decided therebecame known as the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics.*[footnote6.html#fn06] Other interpretations developed later, but the CopenhagenInterpretation marks the emergence of the new physics as a consistent way ofviewing the world. It is still the most prevalent interpretation of themathematical formalism of quantum mechanics. The upheaval in physics followingthe discovery of the inadequacies of Newtonian physics was all but complete. Thequestion among the physicists at Brussels was not whether Newtonian mechanicscould be adapted to subatomic phenomena (it was clear that it could not be), butrather, what was to replace it.The Copenhagen Interpretation was the first consistent formulation of quantummechanics. Einstein opposed it in 1927 and he argued against it until his death,although he, like all physicists, was forced to acknowledge its advantages inexplaining subatomic phenomena.The Copenhagen Interpretation says, in effect, that it does not matter whatquantum mechanics is about!† [footnote7.html#fn07] The important thing is thatit works in all possible experimental situations. This is one of the mostimportant statements in the history of science. The Copenhagen Interpretation ofQuantum Mechanics began a monumental reunion which was all but unnoticed at thetime. The rational part of our psyche, typified by science, began to merge againwith that other part of us which we had ignored since the 1700s, our irrationalside.The scientific idea of truth traditionally had been anchored in an absolutetruth somewhere “out there”—that is, an absolute truth with an independentexistence. The closer that we came in our approximations to the absolute truth,the truer our theories were said to be. Although we might never be able toperceive the absolute truth directly—or to open the watch, as Einstein putit—still we tried to construct theories such that for every facet of absolutetruth, there was a corresponding element in our theories.The Copenhagen Interpretation does away with this idea of a one-to-onecorrespondence between reality and theory. This is another way of saying what wehave said before. Quantum mechanics discards the laws governing individualevents and states directly the laws governing aggregations. It is verypragmatic.The philosophy of pragmatism goes something like this. The mind is such that itdeals only with ideas. It is not possible for the mind to relate to anythingother than ideas. Therefore, it is not correct to think that the mind actuallycan ponder reality. All that the mind can ponder is its ideas about reality.(Whether or not that is the way reality actually is, is a metaphysical issue.)Therefore, whether or not something is true is not a matter of how closely itcorresponds to the absolute truth, but of how consistent it is with ourexperience.* [footnote8.html#fn08]The extraordinary importance of the Copenhagen Interpretation lies in the factthat for the first time, scientists attempting to formulate a consistent physicswere forced by their own findings to acknowledge that a complete understandingof reality lies beyond the capabilities of rational thought. It was this thatEinstein could not accept. “The most incomprehensible thing about the world,” hewrote, “is that it is comprehensible.”11 But the deed was done. The new physicswas based not upon “absolute truth,” but upon us.Henry Pierce Stapp, a physicist at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, expressedthis eloquently:[The Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics] was essentially a rejectionof the presumption that nature could be understood in terms of elementaryspace-time realities. According to the new view, the complete description ofnature at the atomic level was given by probability functions that referred, notto underlying microscopic space-time realities, but rather to the macroscopicobjects of sense experience. The theoretical structure did not extend down andanchor itself on fundamental microscopic space-time realities. Instead it turnedback and anchored itself in the concrete sense realities that form the basis ofsocial life…. This pragmatic description is to be contrasted with descriptionsthat attempt to peer “behind the scenes” and tell us what is “reallyhappening.”12Another way of understanding the Copenhagen Interpretation (in retrospect) is interms of split-brain analysis. The human brain is divided into two halves whichare connected at the center of the cerebral cavity by a tissue. To treat certainconditions, such as epilepsy, the two halves of the brain sometimes areseparated surgically. From the experiences reported by and the observations madeof persons who have undergone this surgery, we have discovered a remarkablefact. Generally speaking, the left side of our brain functions in a differentmanner than the right side. Each of our two brains sees the world in a differentway.The left side of our brain perceives the world in a linear manner. It tends toorganize sensory input into the form of points on a line, with some pointscoming before others. For example, language, which is linear (the words whichyou are reading flow along a line from left to right), is a function of the lefthemisphere. The left hemisphere functions logically and rationally. It is theleft side of the brain which creates the concept of causality, the image thatone thing causes another because it always precedes it. The right hemisphere, bycomparison, perceives whole patterns.Persons who have had split-brain operations actually have two separate brains.When each hemisphere is tested separately, it is found that the left brainremembers how to speak and use words, while the right brain generally cannot.However, the right brain remembers the lyrics of songs! The left side of ourbrain tends to ask certain questions of its sensory input. The right side of ourbrain tends to accept what it is given more freely. Roughly speaking, the lefthemisphere is “rational” and the right hemisphere is “irrational.”13Physiologically, the left hemisphere controls the right side of the body and theright hemisphere controls the left side of the body. In view of this, it is nocoincidence that both literature and mythology associate the right hand (lefthemisphere) with rational, male, and assertive characteristics and the left hand(right hemisphere) with mystical, female, and receptive characteristics. TheChinese wrote about the same phenomena thousands of years ago (yin and yang)although they were not known for their split-brain surgery.Our entire society reflects a left hemispheric bias (it is rational, masculine,and assertive). It gives very little reinforcement to those characteristicsrepresentative of the right hemisphere (intuitive, feminine, and receptive). Theadvent of “science” marks the beginning of the ascent of left hemisphericthinking into the dominant mode of western cognition and the descent of righthemispheric thinking into the underground (underpsyche) status from which it didnot emerge (with scientific recognition) until Freud’s discovery of the“unconscious” which, of course, he labeled dark, mysterious, and irrational(because that is how the left hemisphere views the right hemisphere).The Copenhagen Interpretation was, in effect, a recognition of the limitationsof left hemispheric thought, although the physicists at Brussels in 1927 couldnot have thought in those terms. It was also a re-cognition of those psychicaspects which long had been ignored in a rationalistic society. After all,physicists are essentially people who wonder at the universe. To stand in aweand wonder is to understand in a very specific way, even if that understandingcannot be described. The subjective experience of wonder is a message to therational mind that the object of wonder is being perceived and understood inways other than the rational.The next time you are awed by something, let the feeling flow freely through youand do not try to “understand” it. You will find that you do understand, but ina way that you will not be able to put into words. You are perceivingintuitively through your right hemisphere. It has not atrophied from lack ofuse, but our skill in listening to it has been dulled by three centuries ofneglect.Wu Li Masters perceive in both ways, the rational and the irrational, theassertive and the receptive, the masculine and the feminine. They reject neitherone nor the other. They only dance. DANCING LESSON FOR NEWTONIAN PHYSICS DANCING LESSON FOR QUANTUM MECHANICSCan picture it. Cannot picture it.Based on ordinary sense perceptions.

The next question is, “How does it work?”image [Images/46.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"PART ONEPATTERNS OF ORGANIC ENERGY [dancingwulimastersthe_con01.html#pt_02]"},{"pageContent":"1LIVING? [dancingwulimastersthe_con01.html#ch_03]When we talk of physics as patterns of organic energy, the word that catches ourattention is “organic.” Organic means living. Most people think that physics isabout things that are not living, such as pendulums and billiard balls. This isa common point of view, even among physicists, but it is not as evident as itmay seem.Let us explore this viewpoint with the aid of a hypothetical person, a young mannamed Jim de Wit, who is the perpetual champion of the non-obvious.“It is not at all true,” says Jim de Wit, “that physics is about nonlivingthings. This is evident from our discussion of falling bodies. Even if some ofthem are the human kind, they all accelerate at the same rate in a vacuum. Sophysics does apply to living things.”“But that is an unfair example,” we say. “Rocks have no choice in the matter offalling. If we drop them, they fall. If we don’t drop them, they don’t fall.Humans, on the other hand, exercise choice. Accidents excluded, humansordinarily are not found in the act of falling. Why? Because they know thatfalling may hurt them and they have no desire to be hurt. In other words, humansprocess information (they know that they may be hurt) and they respond to it (bynot falling). Rocks can do neither.”“That is the way things appear,” says de Wit, “but it may not be the way theyactually are. For example, by watching time-lapse photography we know thatplants often respond to stimulae with humanlike reactions. They retreat frompain, advance toward pleasure, and even languish in the absence of affection.The only difference is that they do it at a much slower rate than we do. So muchslower, in fact, that it appears to the ordinary perception that they do notreact at all.“If this is so, then how can we say with certainty that rocks, and even mountainranges, do not react also as living organisms, but with a reaction time so slowthat to catch it with time-lapse photography would require millennia betweenexposures! Of course, there is no way to prove this, but there is no way ofdisproving it either. The distinction between living and nonliving is not soeasy to make.”“That’s clever,” we think, “but from a practical point of view, it cannot beobserved that inert matter responds to stimulae, and there is no question thathumans do.”“Wrong again!” says de Wit, reading our thoughts. “Any chemist can verify thatmost chemicals (which usually come out of the ground as rocks) do react tostimulation. Under the right conditions, for example, sodium reacts to chlorine(by forming sodium chloride—salt), iron reacts to oxygen (by forming ironoxides—rust), and so on, just as humans react to food when they are hungry andto affection when they are lonely.”“Well, this is so,” we admit, “but it hardly seems fair to compare a chemicalreaction to a human reaction. A chemical reaction either happens or it does nothappen. There is nothing in between. When two such chemicals are combinedproperly, they react; if they are not properly combined, they do not react.Humans are much more complex.“If we offer food to a hungry person, he might eat it or he might not, dependingupon his circumstances; and if he eats, he might eat his fill or he might not.Consider the person who is hungry and late for an appointment. If theappointment is important enough, he will go without eating, even though he ishungry. If a person knows that his food is poisonous, he will not eat, eventhough he is hungry. It is a matter of processing information and respondingappropriately that distinguishes a human reaction from a chemical reaction.Chemicals have no options; they always must act one way or the other.”“Of course,” beams Jim de Wit, “but how do we know that our responses are not asrigidly preprogrammed as those of a chemical, with the only difference beingthat our programs are enormously more complex? We may not have any more freedomof action than stones do, although, unlike stones, we deceive ourselves intothinking that we do!”We have no way to dispute this argument. De Wit has shown us the arbitraryquality of our prejudices. We would like to think that we are different fromstones because we are living and they are not, but there is no way we can proveour position or disprove his. We cannot establish clearly that we are differentfrom inorganic substances. That means that, logically, we must admit that we maynot be alive. Since this is absurd, the only alternative is to admit that“inanimate” objects may be living.The distinction between organic and inorganic is a conceptual prejudice. Itbecomes even harder to maintain as we advance into quantum mechanics. Somethingis organic, according to our definition, if it can respond to processedinformation. The astounding discovery awaiting newcomers to physics is that theevidence gathered in the development of quantum mechanics indicates thatsubatomic “particles” constantly appear to be making decisions! More than that,the decisions they seem to make are based on decisions made elsewhere. Subatomicparticles seem to know instantaneously what decisions are made elsewhere, andelsewhere can be as far away as another galaxy! The key word is instantaneously.How can a subatomic particle over here know what decision another particle overthere has made at the same time the particle over there makes it? All theevidence belies the fact that quantum particles are actually particles.A particle, as we mentally picture it (classically defined) is a thing which isconfined to a region in space. It is not spread out. It is either here or it isthere, but it cannot be both here and there at the same time.A particle over here can communicate with a particle over there (by shouting atit, sending it a TV picture, waving, etc.), but that takes time, even if onlymilliseconds. If the two particles are in different galaxies, it could takecenturies. For a particle here to know what is going on over there while it ishappening, it must be over there. But if it is over there, it cannot be here. Ifit is both places at once, then it is no longer a particle.This means that “particles” may not be particles at all. It also means thatthese apparent particles are related with other particles in a dynamic andintimate way that coincides with our definition of organic.Some biologists believe that a single plant cell carries within it thecapability to reproduce the entire plant. Similarly, the philosophicalimplication of quantum mechanics is that all of the things in our universe(including us) that appear to exist independently are actually parts of oneall-encompassing organic pattern, and that no parts of that pattern are everreally separate from it or from each other. To understand these decisions and what makes them, let us start with a discoverymade in 1900 by Max Planck. This year generally is considered the birthday ofquantum mechanics. In December of that year, Planck reluctantly presented to thescientific community a paper which was to make him famous. He himself wasdispleased with the implications of his paper, and he hoped that his colleaguescould do what he could not do: explain its contents in terms of Newtonianphysics. He knew in his heart, however, that they could not, and that neithercould anyone else. He also sensed, and correctly so, that his paper would shiftthe very foundations of science.What had Planck discovered that disturbed him so much? Planck had discoveredthat the basic structure of nature is granular, or, as physicists like to say,discontinuous.What is meant by “discontinuous”?If we talk about the population of a city, it is evident that it can fluctuateonly by a whole number of people. The least the population of a city canincrease or decrease is by one person. It cannot increase by .7 of a person. Itcan increase or decrease by fifteen people, but not by 15.27 people. In thedialect of physics, a population can change only in discrete increments, ordiscontinuously. It can get larger or smaller only in jumps, and the smallestjump that it can make is a whole person. In general, this is what Planckdiscovered about the processes of nature.Planck did not intend to undermine the foundations of Newtonian physics. He wasa conservative German physicist. Rather, he inadvertently fathered therevolution of quantum mechanics by attempting to solve a specific problemdealing with energy radiation.Planck was searching for an explanation of why things behave as they do whenthey get hot. Namely, he wanted to know how objects glow brighter as they gethotter, and change color when the temperature is increased or decreased.Classical physics, which successfully had unified such diverse fields asacoustics, optics, and astronomy, which had all but satiated the scientificappetite, which had unraveled the enigmas of the universe and rearranged them inneat packages, held no sensible explanation of this commonplace phenomenon. Itwas, to use the parlance of the day, one of the few “clouds” on the horizon ofclassical physics.In 1900 physicists pictured the atom as a nucleus that looked something like aplum to which were attached tiny-protruding springs. (This was before theplanetary model of the atom.) At the end of each spring was an electron. Givingthe atom a jolt, by heating it, for instance, caused its electrons to jiggle(oscillate) on the ends of their springs. The jiggling electrons were thought togive off radiant energy, and this was thought to account for the fact that hotobjects glow. (An accelerating electrical charge creates electromagneticradiation.) (An electron carries an electrical charge [negative] and if it isjiggling, it is accelerating—first in one direction and then in the other.)Physicists thought that heating the atoms in a metal caused them to becomeagitated, and this in turn caused their electrons to jiggle up and down and emitlight in the process. The energy that the atom absorbed when it was jolted(heated), the theory went, was radiated by the jiggling electrons. (You cansubstitute “atomic oscillators” if your friends won’t take “jiggling electrons”seriously.)This same theory also claimed that the energy absorbed by an atom wasdistributed equally to its oscillators (electrons) and that those electronswhich oscillated (jiggled) at higher frequencies (faster) radiated their energymost efficiently.Unfortunately, this theory didn’t work. It “proved” some very incorrect things.First, it “proved” that all heated objects emit more high-frequency light (blue,violet) than low-frequency light (red). In other words, even moderately hotobjects, according to this classical theory, emit an intense blue-white color,just like objects which are white-hot, but in lesser amounts. This is incorrect.Moderately hot objects emit primarily red light. Second, the classical theory“proved” that highly heated objects radiate infinite amounts of high-frequencylight. This is incorrect. Highly heated objects emit a finite amount ofhigh-frequency light.Do not be concerned with high frequencies and low frequencies. These terms willbe explained shortly. The point is that Planck was exploring one of the lastmajor problems of classical physics: its erroneous predictions concerning energyradiation. Physicists dubbed this problem “The Ultra-Violet Catastrophe.”Although it sounds like a rock band, “The Ultra-Violet Catastrophe” reflected areal concern with the fact that heated objects do not radiate large amounts ofenergy in the form of ultraviolet light (the highest-frequency light known in1900) the way the classical theory predicted.The name of the phenomenon that Planck was studying is black-body radiation.Black-body radiation is the radiation that comes from a nonreflecting, perfectlyabsorbing, flat (nonglossy) black body. Since black is the absence of color (nolight is reflected or emitted), black bodies have no color unless we heat them.If a black body is glowing a certain color, we know that it is because of theenergy that we have added to it and not because it reflects or emits that colorspontaneously.A “black body” does not always mean a solid body that is black. Suppose that wehave a metal box that is completely sealed except for a small hole. If we lookinside, what do we see? Nothing, because there is no light in there. (A littlelight may come in through the hole, but not that much.)Now suppose that we heat the box until it glows red and then look through thehole. What do we see? Red. (Who said physics is hard?) This is the kind ofphenomenon that Planck studied.All the physicists in 1900 assumed that after the electrons of an excited atombegan to jiggle, they radiated their energy smoothly and continuously until they“ran down” and their energy was dissipated. Planck discovered that excitedatomic oscillators do not do this. They emit and absorb energy only in specificamounts! Instead of radiating energy smoothly and continuously like a clockspring runs down, they radiate their energy in spurts, dropping to a lowerenergy level after each spurt until they stop oscillating altogether. In short,Planck discovered that the changes of nature are “explosive,” not continuous andsmooth.* [footnote9.html#fn09]Planck was the first physicist to talk about “energy packets” and “quantizedoscillators.” He sensed that he had made a major discovery, one which rankedwith the discoveries of Newton, and he was right. The philosophy and paradigmsof physics never were to be the same, although it took another twenty-sevenyears for “quantum mechanics” to take form.It is difficult today to understand how bold was Planck’s theory of quanta.Victor Guillemin, professor of physics at Harvard, put it this way:[Planck] had to make a radical and seemingly absurd assumption, for according toclassical laws, and common sense as well, it had been presumed that anelectronic oscillator, once set in motion by a jolt, radiates its energysmoothly and gradually while its oscillatory motion subsides to rest. Planck hadto assume that the oscillator ejects its radiation in sudden spurts, dropping tolesser amplitudes of oscillation with each spurt. He had to postulate that theenergy of motion of each oscillator can neither build up nor subside smoothlyand gradually but may change only in sudden jumps. In a situation where energyis being transferred to and fro between the oscillators and the light waves, theoscillators must not only emit but also absorb radiant energy in discrete“packets”…. He coined the name “quanta” for the packets of energy, and he spokeof the oscillators as being “quantized.” Thus, the trenchant concept of thequantum entered physical science.1Planck is not only the father of quantum mechanics, he also is the discoverer ofPlanck’s constant. Planck’s constant is a certain number which never changes.*[footnote10.html#fn10] It is used to calculate the size of the energy packets(quanta) of each light frequency (color). (The energy in each light quantum of aparticular color is the frequency of the light multiplied by Planck’s constant.)All of the energy packets of each color have the same amount of energy. All ofthe energy packets of red light, for example, are the same size. All of theenergy packets of green light are the same size. All of the energy packets ofviolet light are the same size. The energy packets of violet light, however, arelarger than the energy packets of green light, and the energy packets of greenlight are larger than the energy packets of red light.In other words, Planck discovered that energy is absorbed and emitted in littlechunks and that the size of the chunks of a low-frequency light, like red, issmaller than the size of the chunks of a high-frequency light, like violet. Thisexplains why hot objects radiate energy as they do.When a black body is put over low heat, the first color it glows is red becausethe energy packets of red light are the smallest energy packets in the visiblelight spectrum. As the heat is increased, more energy is available to shakeloose bigger energy packets. The bigger energy packets make the higher-frequencycolors, such as blue and violet.Why does the glow of hot metal seem to increase steadily in brightness as thetemperature increases? Because the tiny “steps” upward and downward inbrightness are so incredibly small that our eyes cannot discern them. Therefore,on the large scale, or macroscopic level, this aspect of nature is not evident.In the subatomic realm, however, it is the dominant characteristic of nature.If this discussion of emission and absorption of energy packets reminds you ofNiels Bohr, you are right. However, Bohr was not to arrive at his theory ofspecific electron orbits for another thirteen years. By that time physicists haddiscarded the plum-with-jiggling-electrons model of the atom in favor of theplanetary model, in which electrons revolve around a nucleus.*[footnote11.html#fn11]Between Planck’s discovery of the quantum (1900) and Bohr’s analysis of thehydrogen spectrum (1913), a brilliant physicist burst upon the scene with aforce seldom exerted by an individual. His name was Albert Einstein. In one year(1905), at twenty-six, Einstein published five significant papers. Three of themwere pivotal in the development of physics, and, to a large extent, in thedevelopment of the West. The first of these three papers described the quantumnature of light. It won him a Nobel Prize in 1921. The second paper describedmolecular motion. The third paper set forth the special theory of relativity,which we will study later.* [footnote12.html#fn12]Einstein’s theory of light was that it is composed of tiny particles. A beam oflight, said Einstein, is analogous to a stream of bullets. Each bullet is calleda photon. This is similar to what Planck proposed, but actually it is a leapbeyond. Planck discovered that energy is absorbed and emitted in packets. Hedescribed the processes of energy absorption and emission. Einstein theorizedthat energy itself is quantized.To prove his theory, Einstein referred to a phenomenon called the photoelectriceffect. When light hits (impinges on) the surface of a metal, it jars electronsloose from the atoms in the metal and sends them flying off. With appropriateequipment, we can count these electrons and measure how fast they are traveling.Einstein’s theory of the photoelectric effect was that each time one of thebullets, or photons, hits an electron, it knocks it away just as one billiardball hitting another billiard ball knocks it away.Einstein based his revolutionary theory on the experimental work of PhilippeLenard (who won the Nobel Prize in 1905). Lenard showed that the flow ofelectrons in the photoelectric effect begins immediately when the impinginglight strikes the target metal. Turn on the light and out come the electrons.According to the wave theory of light, the electrons in a metal only start tojiggle when they are struck by light waves. They do not come out of the metaluntil they are moving fast enough. This takes several oscillations, like pumpinga child’s swing higher and higher until it goes around the bar. In short, thewave theory of light predicts a delayed emission of electrons. Lenard’sexperiments showed a prompt emission of electrons.This prompt emission of electrons in the photoelectric effect is explained byEinstein’s particle theory of light. Every time a particle of light, a photon,strikes an electron, it immediately knocks it out of its atom.Lenard also discovered that reducing the intensity of the impinging light beam(making it dimmer) did not reduce the velocity of the rebounding electrons, butit did reduce the number of the rebounding electrons. He found that the velocityof the rebounding electrons could be altered, however, by changing the color ofthe impinging light.This also was explained by Einstein’s new theory. According to Einstein’stheory, each photon of a given color, like green, for instance, has a certainamount of energy. Reducing the intensity of a beam of green light only reducesthe number of photons in the beam. Each remaining photon, however, still has thesame amount of energy as any other photon of green light. Therefore, when anyphoton of green light strikes an electron, it knocks it away with a certainamount of energy which is characteristic of green-light photons.Max Planck described Einstein’s theory this way:…The photons (the “drops” of energy) do not grow smaller as the energy of theray grows less; what happens is that their magnitude remains unchanged and theyfollow each other at greater intervals.2Einstein’s theory also substantiated Planck’s revolutionary discovery.High-frequency light, like violet, is made of higher-energy photons thanlow-frequency light, like red. Therefore, when violet light, which is made ofhigh-energy photons, strikes an electron, it causes the electron to rebound witha high velocity. When red light, which is made of low-energy photons, strikes anelectron, it causes the electron to rebound at a low velocity. In either case,increasing or decreasing the intensity of the light increases or decreases thenumber of rebounding electrons, but only by changing the color of the impinginglight can we change their velocity.In short, Einstein demonstrated, using the photoelectric effect, that light ismade of particles, or photons, and that the photons of high-frequency light havemore energy than the photons of low-frequency light. This was a momentousachievement. The only problem was that one hundred and two years earlier anEnglishman named Thomas Young had shown that light is made of waves, and no one,including Einstein, was able to disprove him. Now we come to the matter (no pun) of waves. A particle is something that iscontained in one place. A wave is something that is spread out. Here are sometypes of waves.image [Images/60a.jpg]We are concerned only with the last type of wave. Here is a more detailedpicture of it.image [Images/60b.jpg]A wavelength is the distance between one crest of a wave and the next. Thelongest radio waves are over six miles long. X-rays, on the other hand, are onlyabout one billionth of a centimeter long. Visible light has wavelengths in theneighborhood of four to eight one hundred thousandths of a centimeter.The amplitude of a wave is the height of the wave crest above the dotted line.Here are three waves with different amplitudes. The one in the middle has thelargest amplitude.image [Images/61.jpg]The frequency of the wave tells us how many crests pass a given point (likePoint A in the drawing) each second. If the wave is moving in the direction ofthe arrow and a crest passes point A each second, the frequency of the wave isone cycle per second. If ten and one half crests pass point A every second, thefrequency of the wave is 10.5 cycles per second. If ten thousand crests pass thesame point every second, the frequency of the wave is 10,000 cycles per second,and so on.The velocity of the wave can be determined by multiplying the wavelength by thefrequency. For example, if the wavelength of a wave is two feet and thefrequency of the wave is one cycle per second, the wave is moving one wavelength(two feet) every second. Therefore, its velocity is two feet per second. If thewavelength is two feet and the frequency is three cycles per second, thevelocity of the wave is six feet per second because the wave moves threewavelengths forward every second.There is nothing complicated about this. We can determine how fast a man isrunning if we know the length of his stride and how many of them he takes in asecond. By multiplying them together we get how far the man runs in a second. Ifhis stride is three feet and he takes two strides per second, then he runs sixfeet per second (about four miles per hour). We do the same things with waves,except that we use wavelengths instead of strides.Although the velocity of a light wave can be determined by multiplying itswavelength by its frequency, it is not necessary. Physicists have discoveredthat the velocity of light in empty space is always 186,000 miles per second.This applies to all electromagnetic waves, including light. Therefore, all lightwaves (blue ones, green ones, red ones, etc.) have the same velocity as radiowaves, x-rays, and all the other forms of electromagnetic radiation. The speedof light is a constant. It is represented by the letter “c.”The constant “c” is (approximately) 186,000 miles per second and it never varies(which is what makes it a “constant”). It does not matter whether light is goingup or down, has a high frequency or a low frequency, a large wavelength or asmall wavelength, is coming toward us or going away from us: Its velocity isalways 186,000 miles per second. This fact led Albert Einstein to the theory ofspecial relativity, as we shall see later.It also permits us to know both the frequency and the wavelength of light if weknow either one of them. This is because the product of the two is always186,000 miles per second in empty space. The larger one of them is, the smallerthe other must be. For example, if we know that by multiplying two numberstogether we get 12 for an answer, and if we know that one of the numbers is 6,then we also know that the other number must be 2. If we know that one of thenumbers is 3, then we know that the other number must be 4.Similarly, the higher the frequency of a light wave, the shorter its wavelengthmust be; the lower the frequency of a light wave, the longer its wavelength mustbe. In other words, high-frequency light has a short wavelength andlow-frequency light has a long wavelength.Now we return to Planck’s discovery. Planck discovered that the energy of alight quantum increases with frequency. The higher the frequency, the higher theenergy. Energy is proportional to frequency, and Planck’s constant is the“constant of proportionality” between them. This simple relation betweenfrequency and energy is important. It is central to quantum mechanics. Thehigher the frequency, the higher the energy; the lower the frequency, the lowerthe energy.When we put wave mechanics and Planck’s discovery together we get this:High-frequency light, such as violet light, has a short wavelength and highenergy; low-frequency light, such as red light, has a long wavelength and lowenergy.This explains the photoelectric effect. Photons of violet light knock electronsloose from the atoms of a metal and send them flying away at a higher velocitythan photons of red light because the photons of violet light, which is ahigh-frequency light, have more energy than the photons of red light, which is alow-frequency light.This all makes sense if you overlook the fact that we are talking aboutparticles (photons) in terms of waves (frequencies) and waves in terms ofparticles, which, of course, makes no sense at all.If you feel that you understand the last few pages, congratulations! You havemastered the most difficult mathematics in the book. If not, go back and rereadthese pages. It is easy to dance with wavelengths and frequencies if you knowhow they are connected. Waves are playful creatures that like to do dances of their own. For example,under certain conditions they bend around corners. When this happens it iscalled diffraction.Imagine that we are in a helicopter hovering over the mouth of an artificialharbor. The mouth of the harbor is wide enough for two aircraft carriers to passeach other going through it. The sea is rough and the wind and waves are blowingstraight into the mouth of the harbor. When we look down, this is the patternthat we see the waves making in the harbor:image [Images/64a.jpg]The waves are stopped cleanly by the walls of the harbor except at the harborentrance, where they continue straight forward into the harbor until they aredissipated.Now imagine that the mouth of the harbor is so small that a rowboat scarcely canpass through it. As we look down from the helicopter, the pattern we see isquite different.image [Images/64b.jpg]Instead of moving directly ahead into the harbor, the waves inside the harborare spreading out from the mouth of the harbor almost as if it were a pond andwe had dropped a rock into it at that point. This is diffraction.Why does it happen? Why does reducing the size of the harbor mouth cause thewave pattern inside the harbor to spread out in semi-circles?The answer lies in comparing the size of the harbor mouth to the size of thewavelength of the incoming waves. In the first case, the size of the harbormouth is considerably larger than the distance between the crests of the wavesgoing through it, and the waves proceed directly through it into the harborfollowing a straight line (rectilinear propagation) as waves usually do.In the second case, the size of the harbor mouth is about the same size, orsmaller, than the wavelength of the incoming waves, and when this happens, itcauses the characteristic pattern (diffraction) that we see in the drawing.Whenever waves pass through an opening that is so small that the wavelength ofthe waves passing through it seems large in comparison, the waves passingthrough it diffract.Since light is a wave phenomenon (according to the wave theory of light), itshould behave in the same way, and it does. If we place a light source behind acut-out like the one below, it casts a projection on the wall like this one:image [Images/65.jpg]This is analogous to sea waves entering the large harbor mouth. The width of thecut-out is millions of times larger than the wavelength of the light. As aresult, the light waves go straight through it, following straight lines andprojecting onto the wall a figure with the same shape as the cut-out. Noticeespecially that this projection has distinct borders between the bright area andthe dark area.If we make the cut-out no larger than a razor slit so that its width is roughlyas small as the wavelength of the incoming light, the light diffracts. Now thesharp boundary between the light area and the dark area disappears and we see abright area that fades into darkness at the edges. Instead of proceeding in astraight line to the wall, the light beam has spread out like a fan. This isdiffracted light.Now that you know the punch line, here comes the story.image [Images/66a.jpg]In 1803, Thomas Young settled once and for all (he thought) the question of thenature of light. He used an experiment that was both simple and dramatic. Infront of a light source (Young used sunlight coming through a hole in a screen)he placed a screen with two vertical slits in it. Each slit could be coveredover with a piece of material.image [Images/66b.jpg]On the other side of the double-slit screen was a wall against which the lightcoming through the double slits could shine. When the light source was turned onand one of the slits was covered up, the wall was illuminated like the drawingbelow.image [Images/67a.jpg]When both slits were uncovered, however, Young made history. The projection onthe wall should have been the sum of the light from the two slits, but itwasn’t. Instead, the wall was illuminated with alternating bands of light anddarkness! The center band was the brightest. On both sides of the center band oflight were bands of darkness; then bands of light, but less intense than thecenter band; then bands of darkness, etc., as below.image [Images/67b.jpg]How could this happen?The simplicity of the answer is what makes this experiment a great one. Thealternating light and dark bands are a well-known phenomenon of wave mechanicscalled interference. Interference results when the waves of light diffractingfrom the two slits interfere with each other. In some places these waves overlapand reinforce one another. In other places they cancel each other.In areas where one wave crest overlaps another wave crest, the result is anintensification of light (the light bands). In areas where a crest meets atrough, they cancel each other and no light reaches the wall (the dark bands).It is just as if we dropped two stones into a pond simultaneously and watchedthe waves spreading from their points of entry. The waves that the stones makeinterfere with each other. In places where the crests of the waves caused by onestone meet the crests of the waves caused by the other stone, large wavesresult. In places where the troughs of the waves caused by one stone meet thecrests of the waves caused by the other stone, the water is calm.In short, Young’s double-slit experiment showed that light must be wave-likebecause only waves can create interference patterns. The situation, then, was asfollows: Einstein, using the photoelectric effect, “proved” that light isparticle-like and Young, using the phenomenon of interference, “proved” thatlight is wave-like. But a wave cannot be a particle and a particle cannot be awave.That is just the beginning! Since Einstein “proved” that light is composed ofphotons, let us go back to Young’s double-slit experiment and run it withphotons.* [footnote13.html#fn13] (This has been done.) Suppose that we have alight gun which can fire, in effect, one photon at a time. The experiment is setup as before, except that only one slit is open. Now we fire the photon, it goesthrough the open slit, and we mark where it hits the wall (using a photographicplate). Because we have done this experiment before, we notice that the photonhas landed in an area that would be dark if the second slit were open. That is,if the second slit were open, no photons would be recorded in this area.To make sure, we do the experiment again, but this time we leave both of theslits open. Just as we thought, there are no photons recorded now in the areawhere the photon hit in our first experiment. When both slits are open andinterference is present, this area is in the middle of a dark band.The question is, How did the photon in the first experiment know that the secondslit was not open? Think about it. If both slits are open, there are alwaysalternating bands of illuminated and dark areas. This means that there arealways areas where the photons never go (otherwise there would not be any darkareas). If one of the slits is closed, there is no interference and the darkbands disappear; the whole wall becomes illuminated, including those areas whichpreviously were dark when both slits were open.When we fired our photon and it went through the first slit, how did it “know”that it could go to an area that must be dark if the other slit were open? Inother words, how did the photon know that the other slit was closed?“The central mystery of quantum theory,” wrote Henry Stapp, is ‘How doesinformation get around so quick?’” How does the particle know that there are twoslits? How does the information about what is happening everywhere else getcollected to determine what is likely to happen here?3There is no definitive answer to this question. Some physicists, like E. H.Walker, speculate that photons may be conscious!Consciousness may be associated with all quantum mechanical processes…sinceeverything that occurs is ultimately the result of one or more quantummechanical events, the universe is “inhabited” by an almost unlimited number ofrather discrete conscious, usually nonthinking entities that are responsible forthe detailed working of the universe.4Whether Walker is correct or not, it appears that if there really are photons(and the photoelectric effect “proves” that there are), then it also appearsthat the photons in the double-slit experiment somehow “know” whether or notboth slits are open and that they act accordingly.* [footnote14.html#fn14]This brings us back to where we started: Something is “organic” if it has theability to process information and to act accordingly. We have little choice butto acknowledge that photons, which are energy, do appear to process informationand to act accordingly, and that therefore, strange as it may sound, they seemto be organic. Since we are also organic, there is a possibility that bystudying photons (and other energy quanta) we may learn something about us. The wave-particle duality was the end of the line for classical causality.According to that way of thinking, if we know certain initial conditions, we canpredict the future of events because we know the laws that govern them. Indouble-slit experiments we know all that we can know about initial conditionsand we still can’t predict correctly what happens to single photons.In experiment one, for example (only one slit open), we know the origin of thephoton (the lamp), its velocity (186,000 miles per second), and its directionjust prior to passing through the open slit. Using Newton’s laws of motion, wecan predict where the photon will land on the photographic plate. Let us supposethat we make these calculations.Now let us consider experiment two (both slits open). Again we know the originof the photon, it velocity, and its direction just prior to passing through theopen slit. The initial conditions of the photon in experiment one are the sameas those of the photon in experiment two. They both start from the same place,travel at the same speed, go to the same place, and therefore, are moving in thesame direction just prior to passing through slit number one. The onlydifference is that in the second experiment, the second slit also is open.Again, using Newton’s laws of motion, let us calculate where the photon willland on the photographic plate.Since we used the same figures and the same formulas in both cases, we getidentical answers indicating that the photon in experiment one will impact inexactly the same place as the photon in experiment two. That is the problem. Thephoton in experiment two will not impact in the same area as the photon inexperiment one because the photon in experiment one landed in an area that is adark band in experiment two. In other words, the two photons do not go to thesame place even though the initial conditions pertaining to both of them areidentical and known to us.We cannot determine the paths of individual photons. We can determine what thewave pattern on the wall will be, but in this case we are interested in a singlephoton, not waves of them. In other words, we know the pattern that large groupsof photons will make, and their distribution in the pattern, but we have no wayof knowing which photons will go where. All that we can say about a singlephoton is the probability of finding it in a given place.The wave-particle duality was (is) one of the thorniest problems in quantummechanics. Physicists like to have tidy theories which explain everything, andif they are not able to do that, they like to have tidy theories about why theycan’t. The wave-particle duality is not a tidy situation. In fact, itsuntidiness has forced physicists into radical new ways of perceiving physicalreality. These new perceptual frames are considerably more compatible with thenature of personal experience than were the old.For most of us, life is seldom black and white. The wave-particle duality markedthe end of the “Either-Or” way of looking at the world. Physicists no longercould accept the proposition that light is either a particle or a wave becausethey had “proved” to themselves that it was both, depending on how they lookedat it.Of course, Einstein was aware of the fact that his photon theory contradictedYoung’s wave theory without disproving it. He speculated that photons wereguided by “ghost waves.” Ghost waves were mathematical entities which had noactual existence. The photons seemed to follow paths which had all themathematical characteristics of waves, but which in reality did not exist. Somephysicists still view the wave-particle paradox this way, but for mostphysicists, this explanation seems too contrived. It is an answer which appearsto make sense, but somehow doesn’t explain anything.The wave-particle duality prompted the first real step in understanding thenewly unfolding quantum theory. In 1924, Bohr and two of his colleagues, H. A.Kramers and John Slater, suggested that the waves in question were probabilitywaves. Probability waves were mathematical entities by which physicists couldpredict the probability of certain events occurring or not occurring. Theirmathematics did not prove correct, but their idea, which was unlike anythingthat had been proposed before, was sound. Later, with a different formalism(mathematical structure), the idea of probability waves developed into one ofthe distinguishing characteristics of quantum mechanics.Probability waves, as Bohr, Kramers, and Slater thought of them, was an entirelynew idea. Probability itself was not new, but this type of probability was. Itreferred to what somehow already was happening, but had not yet been actualized.It referred to a tendency to happen, a tendency that in an undefined way existedof itself, even if it never became an event. Probability waves were mathematicalcatalogues of these tendencies.This was something quite different from classical probability. If we throw a diein a casino, we know, using classical probability, that the chances of gettingthe number that we want is one in six. The probability wave of Bohr, Kramers,and Slater meant much more than that.According to Heisenberg:It meant a tendency for something. It was a quantitative version of the oldconcept of “potentia” in Aristotelian philosophy. It introduced somethingstanding in the middle between the idea of an event and the actual event, astrange kind of physical reality just in the middle between possibility andreality.5By 1924, Planck’s discovery of the quantum was producing seismic effects inphysics. It enabled Einstein to discover the photon, which caused thewave-particle duality, which led to probability waves. The physics of Newton wasa thing of the past.Physicists found themselves dealing with energy that somehow processedinformation (which made it organic), and unaccountably presented itself inpatterns (waves). In short, physicists found themselves dealing with WuLi—patterns of organic energy."},{"pageContent":"1WHAT HAPPENS [dancingwulimastersthe_con01.html#ch_04]Quantum mechanics is a procedure. It is a specific way of looking at a specificpart of reality. The only people who use it are physicists. The advantage offollowing the procedure of quantum mechanics is that it allows us to predict theprobabilities of certain results provided our experiment is performed in acertain way. The purpose of quantum mechanics is not to predict what actuallywill happen, but only to predict the probabilities of various possible results.Physicists would like to be able to predict subatomic events more accurately,but, at present, quantum mechanics is the only workable theory of subatomicphenomena that they have been able to construct.Probabilities follow deterministic laws in the same way that macroscopic eventsfollow deterministic laws. There is a direct parallel. If we know enough aboutthe initial conditions of an experiment, we can calculate, using rigid laws ofdevelopment, exactly what the probability is for a certain result to occur.For example, there is no way that we can calculate where a single photon in adouble-slit experiment will strike the photographic plate. However, we cancalculate with precision the probability that it will strike it at a certainplace, provided that the experiment has been prepared properly and that theresults are measured properly.Suppose that we calculate a 60 percent probability for the photon to land inarea A. Does that mean that it can land somewhere else? Yes. In fact, there is a40 percent probability that it will.In that case (asking the question for Jim de Wit), what determines where thephoton will land? The answer given by quantum theory: pure chance.This pure-chance aspect was another objection that Einstein had about quantummechanics. It is one of the reasons that he never accepted it as the fundamentalphysical theory. “Quantum mechanics is very impressive,” he wrote in a letter toMax Born, “…but I am convinced that God does not play dice.”1Two generations later, J. S. Bell, a Scotish physicist, proved that he may havebeen right, but that is another story, which we will come to later.The first step in the procedure of quantum mechanics is to prepare a physicalsystem (the experimental apparatus) according to certain specifications, in anarea called the region of preparation.The second step in the procedure of quantum mechanics is to prepare anotherphysical system to measure the results of the experiment. This measuring systemis located in an area called the region of measurement. Ideally, the region ofmeasurement is far away from the region of preparation. Of course, to asubatomic particle, even a small macroscopic distance is a long way.Now let us perform the double-slit experiment using this procedure. First, weset a light source on a table, and then, a short distance away, we place ascreen with two vertical slits in it. The area where these apparatuses arelocated is the region of preparation. Next we fix an unexposed photographicplate on the opposite side of the screen from the light source. This area is theregion of measurement.The third step in the procedure of quantum mechanics is to translate what weknow about the apparatus in the region of preparation (the light and the screen)into mathematical terms which represent it, and to do likewise for the apparatusthat is located in the region of measurement (the photographic plate).To do this we need to know the specifications of the apparatus. In practice,this means that we give the technician who sets up the equipment preciseinstructions. We tell him, for example, the exact distance to place thedouble-slit screen from the light source, the frequency and intensity of thelight that we will use, the dimensions of the two slits and their positionrelative to each other and to the light source, etc. We also give him equallyexplicit instructions concerning the measuring apparatus, such as where to putit, the type of photographic film that we will use, how to develop it, etc.After we translate these specifications of the experimental arrangement into themathematical language of quantum theory, we feed these mathematical quantitiesinto an equation that expresses the form of natural causal development. Noticethat this last sentence doesn’t say anything about what is developing. That isbecause nobody knows. The Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics saysthat quantum theory is a complete theory because it works (correlatesexperience) in every possible experimental situation, not because it explains indetail what is going on.* [footnote15.html#fn15] (Einstein’s complaint was thatquantum theory doesn’t fully explain things because it deals with group behaviorand not with individual events.)However, when it comes to predicting group behavior, quantum theory works asadvertised. In a double-slit experiment, for example, it can predict exactly theprobabilities of a photon being recorded in region A, in region B, in region C,and so forth.Of course, the last step in the procedure of quantum mechanics is actually to dothe experiment and get a result.To apply quantum theory, the physical world must be divided into two parts.These parts are the observed system and the observing system. The observedsystem and the observing system are not the same as the region of preparationand the region of measurement. “Region of preparation” and “region ofmeasurement” are terms which describe the physical organization of theexperimental apparatus. “Observed system” and “observing system” are terms whichpertain to the way that physicists analyze the experiment. (The “observed”system, by the way, cannot be observed until it interacts with the observingsystem, and even then all that we can observe are its effects on a measuringdevice.)The observed system in the double-slit experiment is a photon. It is pictured astraveling between the region of preparation and the region of measurement. Theobserving system in all quantum mechanical experiments is the environment whichsurrounds the observed system—including the physicists who are studying theexperiment. While the observed system is traveling undisturbed (“propagating inisolation”), it develops according to a natural causal law. This law of causaldevelopment is called the Schrödinger wave equation. The information that we putinto the Schrödinger wave equation is the data about the experimentalapparatuses that we have transcribed into the mathematical language of quantumtheory.Each set of these experimental specifications that we transcribed into themathematical language of quantum theory corresponds to what physicists call an“observable.” Observables are the features of the experiment and nature that areconsidered to be fixed, or determined, when and if the experimentalspecifications that we have transcribed actually are met. We may havetranscribed into mathematical language several experimental specifications forthe region of measurement, each one corresponding to a different possible result(the possibility that the photon will land in region A, the possibility that thephoton will land in region B, the possibility that the photon will land inregion C, etc.).In the world of mathematics, the experimental specifications of each of thesepossible situations in the region of measurement and in the region ofpreparation corresponds to an observable.* [footnote16.html#fn16] In the worldof experience, an observable is the possible occurrence (coming into ourexperience) of one of these sets of specifications.In other words, what happens to the observed system between the region ofpreparation and the region of measurement is expressed mathematically as acorrelation between two observables (production and detection). Yet we know thatthe observed system is a particle—a photon. Said another way, the photon is arelationship between two observables. This is a long, long way from thebuilding-brick concept of elementary particles. For centuries scientists havetried to reduce reality to indivisible entities. Imagine how surprising andfrustrating it is for them to come so close (a photon is very “elementary”),only to discover that elementary particles don’t have an existence of their own!As Stapp wrote for the Atomic Energy Commission:…an elementary particle is not an independently existing, unanalyzable entity.It is, in essence, a set of relationships that reach outward to other things.2Furthermore, the mathematical picture which physicists have constructed of this“set of relationships” is very similar to the mathematical picture of a real(physical) moving particle.* [footnote17.html#fn17] The motion of such a set ofrelationships is governed by exactly the same equation which governs the motionof a real moving particle.Wrote Stapp:A long-range correlation between observables has the interesting property thatthe equation of motion which governs the propagation of this effect is preciselythe equation of motion of a freely moving particle.3Things are not “correlated” in nature. In nature, things are as they are.Period. “Correlation” is a concept which we use to describe connections which weperceive. There is no word, “correlation,” apart from people. There is noconcept, “correlation,” apart from people. This is because only people use wordsand concepts.“Correlation” is a concept. Subatomic particles are correlations. If we weren’there to make them, there would not be any concepts, including the concept of“correlation.” In short, if we weren’t here to make them, there wouldn’t be anyparticles!* [footnote18.html#fn18]Quantum mechanics is based on the development in isolation of an observedsystem. “Development in isolation” refers to the isolation that we create byseparating the region of preparation from the region of measurement. We callthis situation “isolation,” but in reality, nothing is completely isolated,except, perhaps, the universe as a whole. (What would it be isolated from?)The “isolation” that we create is an idealization, and one point of view is thatquantum mechanics allows us to idealize a photon from the fundamental unbrokenunity so that we can study it. In fact, a “photon” seems to become isolated fromthe fundamental unbroken unity because we are studying it.Photons do not exist by themselves. All that exists by itself is an unbrokenwholeness that presents itself to us as webs (more patterns) of relations.Individual entities are idealizations which are correlations made by us.In short, the physical world, according to quantum mechanics, is:…not a structure built out of independently existing unanalyzable entities, butrather a web of relationships between elements whose meanings arise wholly fromtheir relationships to the whole. (Stapp)4The new physics sounds very much like old eastern mysticism.What happens between the region of preparation and the region of measurement isa dynamic (changing with time) unfolding of possibilities that occurs accordingto the Schrödinger wave equation. We can determine, for any moment in thedevelopment of these possibilities, the probability of any one of themoccurring.One possibility may be that the photon will land in region A. Anotherpossibility may be that the photon will land in region B. However, it is notpossible for the same photon to land in region A and in region B at the sametime. When one of these possibilities is actualized, the probability that theother one will occur at the same time becomes zero.How do we cause a possibility to become an actuality? We “make a measurement.”Making a measurement interferes with the development of these possibilities. Inother words, making a measurement interferes with the development in isolationof the observed system. When we interfere with the development in isolation ofthe observed system (which is what Schrödinger’s wave equation governs) weactualize one of the several potentialities that were a part of the observedsystem while it was in isolation. For example, as soon as we detect the photonin region A, the possibility that it is in region B, or anyplace else, becomesnihil.The development of possibilities that takes place between the region ofpreparation and the region of measurement is represented by a particular kind ofmathematical entity. Physicists call this mathematical entity a “wave function”because it looks, mathematically, like a development of waves which constantlychange and proliferate. In a nutshell, the Schrödinger wave equation governs thedevelopment in isolation (between the region of preparation and the region ofmeasurement) of the observed system (a photon in this case) which is representedmathematically by a wave function.A wave function is a mathematical fiction that represents all the possibilitiesthat can happen to an observed system when it interacts with an observing system(a measuring device). The form of the wave function of an observed system can becalculated via the Schrödinger wave equation for any moment between the time theobserved system leaves the region of preparation and the time that it interactswith the observing system.Once the wave function is calculated, we can perform a simple mathematicaloperation on it (square its amplitude) to create a second mathematical entitycalled a probability function (or, technically, a “probability densityfunction”). The probability function tells us the probabilities at a giventime(s) of each of the possibilities represented by the wave function. The wavefunction is calculated with the Schrödinger wave equation. It deals withpossibilities. The probability function is based upon the wave function. Itdeals with probabilities.There is a difference between possible and probable. Some things may bepossible, but not very probable, like snow falling in the summer, except inAntarctica where it is both possible and probable.The wave function of an observed system is a mathematical catalogue which givesa physical description of those things which could happen to the observed systemwhen we make a measurement on it. The probability function gives theprobabilities of those events actually happening. It says, “These are the oddsthat this or that will happen.”Before we interfere with the development in isolation of an observed system, itmerrily continues to generate possibilities in accordance with the Schrödingerwave equation. As soon as we make a measurement, however—look to see what ishappening—the probability of all the possibilities, except one, becomes zero,and the probability of that possibility becomes one, which means that ithappens.The development of the wave function (possibilities) follows an unvaryingdeterminism. We calculate this development by using the Schrödinger waveequation. Since the probability function is based upon the wave function, theprobabilities of possible happenings also develop deterministically via theSchrödinger wave equation.This is why we can predict accurately the probability of an event, but not theevent itself. We can calculate the probability of a desired result, but when wemake a measurement, that result may or may not be the one that we get. Thephoton may land in region B or it may land in region A. Which possibilitybecomes reality is, according to quantum theory, a matter of chance.Now back to the double-slit experiment. We cannot predict where a photon in adouble-slit experiment will land. However, we can calculate where it is mostlikely to land, where it is next likely to land, and so on.*[footnote19.html#fn19] This is how it happens.Suppose that we place a photon detector at slit one and another photon detectorat slit two. Now we emit photons from the light source. Sooner or later one ofthem will go through one slit or the other. There are two possibilities for thatphoton. It can go through slit one and detector one will fire, or it can gothrough slit two and detector two will fire. Each of these possibilities isincluded in the wave function of that photon.Let us say that when we examine the detectors we find that detector two hasfired. As soon as we know this we also know that the photon did not go throughslit one. That possibility no longer exists, and, therefore, the wave functionof the photon has changed.The graphic representation (picture) of the wave function of the photon, beforewe made the measurement, had two humps in it. One of the humps represented thepossibility of the photon passing through slit one and detector one firing. Theother hump represented the possibility of the photon passing through slit twoand detector two firing.When the photon was detected passing through slit two, the possibility that itwould go through slit one ceased to exist. When that happened, the hump in thegraphic representation of the wave function representing that possibilitychanged to a straight line. This phenomenon is called the “collapse of the wavefunction.”Physicists speak as if the wave function exhibits two very different modes ofdevelopment. The first is a smooth and dynamic development, which we can predictbecause it follows the Schrödinger wave equation. The second is abrupt anddiscontinuous (that word, again). This mode of development is the collapse ofthe wave function. Which part of the wave function collapses is a matter ofchance. The transition from the first mode to the second mode is called aquantum jump.The Quantum Jump is not a dance. It is the abrupt collapse of all the developingaspects of the wave function except the one that actualizes. The mathematicalrepresentation of the observed system literally leaps from one situation toanother, with no apparent development between the two.In a quantum mechanical experiment, the observed system, traveling undisturbedbetween the region of preparation and the region of measurement, developsaccording to the Schrödinger wave equation. During this time, all of the allowedthings that could happen to it unfold as a developing wave function. However, assoon as it interacts with a measuring device (the observing system), one ofthose possibilities actualizes and the rest cease to exist. The quantum leap isfrom a multifaceted potentiality to a single actuality.The quantum leap is also a leap from a reality with a theoretically infinitenumber of dimensions into a reality which has only three. This is because thewave function of the observed system, before it is observed, proliferates inmany mathematical dimensions.Take the wave function of our photon in the double-slit experiment for example.It contains two possibilities. The first possibility is that the photon will gothrough slit one and detector one will fire, and the second possibility is thatthe photon will go through slit two and detector two will fire. Each of thesepossibilities, alone, would be represented by a wave function that exists inthree dimensions and a time. This is because our reality has three dimensions,length, width, and depth, along with time.If we want to describe a physical event accurately, we must say where ithappened and when.To describe where something happens requires three “coordinates.” Suppose that Iwant to give directions to an invisible balloon floating in an empty room. Icould say, for example, “Starting in a certain corner, go five feet along acertain wall (one dimension), four feet directly out from the wall (seconddimension), and three feet up from the floor (third dimension).” Everypossibility exists in three dimensions and has a time.If the wave function represents possibilities associated with two differentparticles, then that wave function exists in six dimensions, three for eachparticle. If the wave function represents the possibilities associated withtwelve particles, then that wave function exists in thirty-six dimensions!*[footnote20.html#fn20]This is impossible to visualize since our experience is limited to threedimensions. Nontheless, this is the mathematics of the situation.The point to think about is that when we make a measurement in a quantummechanical experiment—when the observed system interacts with the observingsystem—we reduce a multidimensional reality to a three-dimensional realitycompatible with our experience.If we calculate a wave function for possible photon detection at four differentpoints, that wave function is a mathematical reality in which four differenthappenings exist simultaneously in twelve dimensions. In principle, we cancalculate a wave function representing an infinite number of events happening atthe same time in an infinite number of dimensions. No matter how complex thewave function, however, as soon as we make a measurement, we reduce it to a formcompatible with three-dimensional reality, which is the only form ofexperiential reality, instant by instant, normally available to us. Now we come to the question, “When, exactly, does the wave function collapse?”When do all of the possibilities that are developing for the observed system,except one, vanish?Up to now, we have said that the collapse occurs when somebody looks at theobserved system. This is only one point of view. Another opinion (any discussionabout this question is opinion) is that the wave function collapses when I lookat the observed system. Still another opinion is that the wave functioncollapses when any measurement is made, even by an instrument. According to thisview, it is not important whether we are there to see it or not.Suppose for the moment that there are no human experimenters involved in ourexperiment. It is entirely automatic. A light source emits a photon. The wavefunction of the photon contains the possibility that the photon will passthrough slit one and detector one will fire, and also the possibility that thephoton will pass through slit two and detector two will fire.Now suppose that detector two registers a photon.According to classical physics, the light source emitted a real particle, aphoton, and it traveled from the light source to the slit where detector tworecorded it. Although we did not know its location while it was in transit, wecould have determined it, if we had known how.According to quantum mechanics, this is not so. No real particle called a photontraveled between the light source and the screen. There was no photon until oneactualized at slit two. Until then, there was only a wave function. In otherwords, until then, all that existed were tendencies for a photon to actualizeeither at slit one or at slit two.From the classical point of view, a real photon travels between the light sourceand the screen. The odds are 50–50 that it will go to slit one and 50–50 that itwill go to slit two. From the point of view of quantum mechanics, there is nophoton until a detector fires. There is only a developing potentiality in whicha photon goes to slit one and to slit two. This is Heisenberg’s “strange kind ofphysical reality just in the middle between possibility and reality.”5It is difficult to make this sound less vague. The translation from mathematicsto English entails a loss of precision but that is not the problem. We canexperience a more clearly defined picture of this phenomenon by learning enoughmathematics to follow the development of the Schrödinger wave equation.Unfortunately, clarifying the picture only helps to boggle the mind.The real problem is that we are used to looking at the world simply. We areaccustomed to believing that something is there or it is not there. Whether welook at it or not, it is either there or it is not there. Our experience tellsus that the physical world is solid, real, and independent of us. Quantummechanics says, simply, that this is not so.Suppose that a technician, not knowing that our experiment is automatic, entersthe room to see which detector has recorded a photon. When he looks at theobserving system (the detectors), there are two things that he can see. Thefirst possibility is that detector one has recorded the photon, and the secondpossibility is that detector two has recorded the photon. The wave function ofthe observing system (which now is the technician), therefore, has two humps init, one for each possibility.Until the technician looks at the detectors, quantum mechanically speaking, bothsituations in some way exist. As soon as he sees that detector two has fired,however, the possibility that detector one has fired vanishes. That part of thewave function of the measuring system collapses, and the reality of thetechnician is that detector two has recorded a photon. In other words, theobserving system of the experiment, the detectors, has become the observedsystem in relation to the technician.Now suppose that the supervising physicist enters the room to check on thetechnician. He wants to see what the technician has learned about the detectors.In this regard, there are two possibilities. One is that the technician has seenthat detector one has recorded a photon, and the other is that the technicianhas seen that detector two has recorded a photon, and so on.*[footnote21.html#fn21]The division of the wave function into two humps, each one representing apossibility, has progressed from photon to detectors to technician tosupervisor. This proliferation of possibilities is the type of developmentgoverned by the Schrödinger wave equation.Without perception, the universe continues, via the Schrödinger equation, togenerate an endless profusion of possibilities. The effect of perception,however, is immediate and dramatic. All of the wave function representing theobserved system collapses, except one part, which actualizes into reality. Noone knows what causes a particular possibility to actualize and the rest tovanish. The only law governing this phenomenon is statistical. In other words,it is up to chance.The division into two parts of the wave function of the photon, detectors,technician, supervisor, etc., is known as the “Problem of Measurement” (or,sometimes, “The Theory of Measurement”). † [footnote22.html#fn22] If there weretwenty-five possibilities in the wave function of the photon, the wave functionof the measuring system, technician, and supervisor similarly would havetwenty-five separate humps, until a perception is made and the wave functioncollapses. From photon to detectors to technician to supervisor we couldcontinue until we include the entire universe. Who is looking at the universe?Put another way, How is the universe being actualized?The answer comes full circle. We are actualizing the universe. Since we are partof the universe, that makes the universe (and us) self-actualizing.This line of thought is similar to some aspects of Buddhist psychology. Inaddition, it could become one of many important contributions of physics tofuture models of consciousness. The Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics says that it is unnecessaryto “peer behind the scenes to see what is really happening as long as quantummechanics works (correlates experience correctly) in all possible experimentalsituations. It is not necessary to know how light can manifest itself both asparticles and waves. It is enough to know that it does and to be able to usethis phenomenon to predict probabilities. In other words, the wave and particlecharacteristics of light are unified by quantum mechanics, but at a price. Thereis no description of reality.All attempts to describe “reality” are relegated to the realm of metaphysicalspeculation.* [footnote23.html#fn23] However, this does not mean that physicistsdo not speculate. Many do, in particular Henry Stapp, and their reasoning goeslike this.The fundamental theoretical quantity in quantum mechanics is the wave function.The wave function is a dynamic (it changes as time progresses) description ofpossible occurrences. But what does the wave function describe, really?According to western thought, the world has only two essential aspects, one ofwhich is matter-like and the other of which is idea-like.The matter-like aspect is associated with the external world, most of which isconceived to be made of inanimate stuff that is hard and unresponsive, likerocks, pavement, metal, etc. The idea-like aspect is cur subjective experience.Reconciling these two has been a central theme of religion through history. Thephilosophies which champion these aspects are Materialism (the world ismatter-like, regardless of our impressions) and Idealism (reality is idea-like,regardless of appearances). The question is, which one of these aspects does thewave function represent?The answer, according to the orthodox view of quantum mechanics elucidated byStapp, is that the wave function represents something that partakes of bothidea-like and matter-like characteristics.* [footnote24.html#fn24]For example, when the observed system as represented by the wave functionpropagates in isolation between the region of preparation and the region ofmeasurement, it develops according to a strictly deterministic law (theSchrödinger wave equation). Temporal development in accordance with a causal lawis a matter-like characteristic. Therefore, whatever the wave functionrepresents, that something has a matter-like aspect.However, when the observed system as represented by the wave function interactswith the observing system (when we make a measurement), it abruptly leaps to anew state. These “Quantum Leap” type transitions are idea-like characteristics.Ideas (like our knowledge about something) can and do change discontinuously.Therefore, whatever the wave function represents, that something also has anidea-like aspect.The wave function, strictly speaking, represents an observed system in a quantummechanical experiment. In more general terms, it describes physical reality atthe most fundamental level (the subatomic) that physicists have been able toprobe. In fact, according to quantum mechanics, the wave function is a completedescription of physical reality at that level. Most physicists believe that adescription of the substructure underlying experience more complete than thewave function is not possible.“Wait a minute!” says Jim de Wit (where did he come from?). “The descriptioncontained in the wave function consists of coordinates (three, six, nine, etc.)and a time. How can that be a complete description of reality? Imagine how Ifelt when my girlfriend ran off to Mexico with a gypsy. Where does that show upin a wave function?”It doesn’t. The “complete description” that quantum theory claims the wavefunction to be is a description of physical reality (as in physics). No matterwhat we are feeling, or thinking about, or looking at, the wave functiondescribes as completely as possible where and when we are doing it.Since the wave function is thought to be a complete description of physicalreality and since that which the wave function describes is idea-like as well asmatter-like, then physical reality must be both idea-like and matter-like. Inother words, the world cannot be as it appears. Incredible as it sounds, this isthe conclusion of the orthodox view of quantum mechanics. The physical worldappears to be completely substantive (made of “stuff”). Nonetheless, if it hasan idea-like aspect, the physical world is not substantive in the usual sense ofthe word (one hundred percent matter, zero percent idea). According to Stapp:If the attitude of quantum mechanics is correct, in the strong sense that adescription of the substructure underlying experience more complete than the oneit provides is not possible, then there is no substantive physical world, in theusual sense of this term. The conclusion here is not the weak conclusion thatthere may not be a substantive physical world but rather that there definitelyis not a substantive physical world.6This does not mean that the world is completely idea-like. The CopenhagenInterpretation of Quantum Mechanics does not go so far as to say what reality is“really like behind the scenes,” but it does say that it is not like it appears.It says that what we perceive to be physical reality is actually our cognitiveconstruction of it. This cognitive construction may appear to be substantive,but the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics leads directly to theconclusion that the physical world itself is not.This claim at first appears so preposterous and remote from experience that ourinclination is to discard it as the foolish product of cloistered intellectuals.However, there are several good reasons why we should not be so hasty. The firstreason is that quantum mechanics is a logically consistent system. It isself-consistent and it also is consistent with all known experiments.Second, the experimental evidence itself is incompatible with our ordinary ideasabout reality.Third, physicists are not the only people who view the world this way. They areonly the newest members of a sizable group; most Hindus and Buddhists also holdsimilar views.Therefore, it is evident that even physicists who disclaim metaphysics havedifficulty avoiding it. Now we come to those physicists who have jumped feetfirst into describing “reality.” So far our discussions have been based on the Copenhagen Interpretation ofQuantum Mechanics. The unavoidable flaw in this interpretation is the Problem ofMeasurement. Some type of detection by an observing system is required tocollapse the wave function of the observed system into a physical reality,otherwise the “observed system” does not physically exist except as an endlesslyproliferating number of possibilities generated in accordance with theSchrödinger wave equation.The theory proposed by Hugh Everett, John Wheeler, and Neill Graham solves thisproblem in the simplest way possible.7 It claims that the wave function is areal thing, all of the possibilities that it represents are real, and they allhappen. The orthodox interpretation of quantum mechanics is that only one of thepossibilities contained in the wave function of an observed system actualizes,and the rest vanish. The Everett-Wheeler-Graham theory says that they allactualize, but in different worlds that coexist with ours!Let’s go back to the double-slit experiment again. A light source emits aphoton. The photon can pass through slit one or through slit two. A detector isplaced at slit one and at slit two. Now we add a new experimental procedure. Ifthe photon goes through slit one, I run upstairs. If the photon goes throughslit two, I run downstairs. Therefore, one possible occurrence is that thephoton goes through slit one, detector one fires, and I run up the stairs. Thesecond possible occurrence is that the photon goes through slit two, detectortwo fires, and I run down the stairs.According to the Copenhagen Interpretation, these two possibilities are mutuallyexclusive because it is not possible for me to run upstairs and to rundownstairs at the same time.According to the Everett-Wheeler-Graham theory, at the moment the wave function“collapses,” the universe splits into two worlds. In one of them I run up thestairs and in the other I run down the stairs. There are two distinct editionsof me. Each one of them is doing something different, and each one of them isunaware of the other. Nor will their (our) paths ever cross since the two worldsinto which the original one split are forever separate branches of reality.In other words, according to the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics,the development of the Schrödinger wave equation generates an endlesslyproliferating number of possibilities. According to the Everett-Wheeler-Grahamtheory, the development of the Schrödinger wave equation generates an endlesslyproliferating number of different branches of reality! This theory is called,appropriately, the Many Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics.The theoretical advantage of the Many Worlds Interpretation is that it does notrequire an “external observer” to “collapse” one of the possibilities containedin a wave function into physical reality. According to the Many Worlds theory,wave functions do not collapse, they just keep splitting as they developaccording to the Schrödinger wave equation. When a consciousness happens to bepresent at such a split, it splits also, one part of it associating with onebranch of reality and the other part(s) of it associating with the otherbranch(es) of reality. However, each branch of reality is experientiallyinaccessable to the other(s), and a consciousness in any one branch willconsider that branch to be the entirety of reality. Therefore, the role ofconsciousness, which was central to the Copenhagen Interpretation (ifconsciousness is associated with an act of measurement), is incidental to theMany Worlds theory.However, the Many Worlds description of the structure of the relationshipbetween the various branches of physical reality sounds like a quantitativeversion of a mystical vision of unity. Every state of a subsystem of a compositesystem is uniquely correlated to the states of the remaining subsystems whichconstitute the whole of which it is a part. (A “composite system,” in this case,means a combination of both the observed system and the observing system. Inother words, every state of the observed system is correlated to a particularstate of the observing system).Said another way, the Many Worlds theory defines any particular branch ofreality which might “actualize” to us as a result of an interaction of anobserved system and an observing system as merely one way of decomposing thewave function which represents them both. According to this theory, all of theother states which “could have” resulted from the same interaction did happen,but in other branches of reality. Each of these branches of reality are real,and, together, they constitute all the different ways in which we can decomposethe universal wave function.In this way, the Problem of Measurement is no longer a problem. The problem ofmeasurement, ultimately, was, “Who is looking at the universe?” The Many Worldstheory says that it is not necessary to collapse a wave function to actualizethe universe. All of the mutually exclusive possibilities contained within thewave function of an observed system that (according to the CopenhagenInterpretation) do not actualize when the wave function “collapses” actually doactualize, but not in this branch of the universe. In our experiment, forexample, one of the possibilities contained in the wave function actualizes inthis branch of the universe (I run up the stairs). The other possibilitycontained in the wave function (I run down the stairs) also actualizes, but in adifferent branch of reality. In this branch of reality I run up the stairs. Inanother branch of reality I run down the stairs. Neither “I” knows the other.Both “I”s believe that their branch of the universe is the entirety of reality.The Many Worlds theory says that there is one universe and that its wavefunction represents all of the ways that it can be decomposed into differentpossible realities. We are all together here in a big box and it is notnecessary to look at the box from the outside to actualize it.In this regard, the Many Worlds theory is especially interesting becauseEinstein’s general theory of relativity shows that our universe might besomething like a large closed box and, if this is so, it is never possible toget “outside” of it.* [footnote25.html#fn25] “Schrödinger’s Cat” sums up the differences between classical physics, theCopenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, and the Many WorldsInterpretation of Quantum Mechanics. “Schrödinger’s Cat” is a dilemma posed longago by the famous discoverer of the Schrödinger wave equation:A cat is placed inside a box. Inside the box is a device which can release agas, instantly killing the cat. A random event (the radioactive decay of anatom) determines whether the gas is released or not. There is no way of knowing,outside of looking into the box, what happens inside it. The box is sealed andthe experiment is activated. A moment later, the gas either has been released orhas not been released. The question is, without looking, what has happenedinside the box. (This is reminiscent of Einstein’s unopenable watch.)According to classical physics, the cat is either dead or it is not dead. Allthat we have to do is to open the box and see which is the case. According toquantum mechanics, the situation is not so simple.The Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics says that the cat is in akind of limbo represented by a wave function which contains the possibility thatthe cat is dead and also the possibility that the cat is alive.*[footnote26.html#fn26] When we look in the box, and not before, one of thesepossibilities actualizes and the other vanishes. This is known as the collapseof the wave function because the hump in the wave function representing thepossibility that did not occur, collapses. It is necessary to look into the boxbefore either possibility can occur. Until then, there is only a wave function.Of course, this does not make sense. Experience tells us that a cat is what weput into the box and a cat is still what is inside the box, not a wave function.The only question is whether the cat is a live cat or a dead cat. But a cat isthere whether we look at it or not. If we take a vacation before we look insidethe box, it makes no difference as far as the cat is concerned. Its fate wasdecided at the beginning of the experiment.This commonsense view is also the view of classical physics. According toclassical physics, we get to know something by observing it. According toquantum mechanics, it isn’t there until we do observe it! Therefore, the fate ofthe cat is not determined until we look inside the box.The Many Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics and the CopenhagenInterpretation of Quantum Mechanics agree that the fate of the cat is notdetermined for us until we look inside the box. What happens after we lookinside the box, however, depends upon which interpretation we choose to follow.According to the Copenhagen Interpretation, at the instant that we look insidethe box, one of the possibilities contained in the wave function representingthe cat actualizes and the other possibility vanishes. The cat is either dead oralive.According to the Many Worlds Interpretation, at the instant that the atom decays(or doesn’t decay, depending upon which branch of reality we are talking about),the world splits into two branches, each with a different edition of the cat.The wave function representing the cat does not collapse. The cat is both deadand alive. At the instant that we look into the box, our wave function alsosplits into two branches, one associated with the branch of reality in which thecat is dead and one associated with the branch of reality in which the cat isalive. Neither consciousness is aware of the other.In short, classical physics says that there is one world, it is as it appears,and this is it. Quantum physics allows us to entertain the possibility that thisis not so. The Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics eschews adescription of what the world is “really like,” but concludes that whatever itis like, it is not substantive in the usual sense. The Many WorldsInterpretation of Quantum Mechanics says that different editions of us live inmany worlds simultaneously, an uncountable number of them, and all of them arereal. There are even more interpretations of quantum mechanics, but all of themare weird in some way.Quantum physics is stranger than science fiction. Quantum mechanics is a theory and a procedure dealing with subatomic phenomena.Subatomic phenomena, in general, are inaccessible to all but those with accessto elaborate (and expensive) facilities. Even at the most expensive andelaborate facilities, however, we can see only the effects of subatomicphenomena. The subatomic realm is beyond the limits of sensory perception.*[footnote27.html#fn27] It is also beyond the limits of rational understanding.Of course, we have rational theories about it, but “rational” has been stretchedto include what formerly was nonsense, or, at best, paradox.The world that we live in, the world of freeways, bathtubs, and other people,seems as remote as it can be from wave functions and interference. In short, themetaphysics of quantum mechanics is based upon an unsubstantiated leap from themicroscopic to the macroscopic. Can we apply these implications of subatomicresearch to the world at large?No, not if we have to provide a mathematical proof in each instance. But what isa proof? A proof only proves that we are playing by the rules. (We make therules, anyway.) The rules, in this case, are that what we propose about thenature of physical reality (1) be logically consistent, and (2) that itcorrespond to experience. There is nothing in the rules that says that what wepropose has to be anything like “reality.” Physics is a self-consistentexplanation of experience. It is in order to satisfy the self-consistencyrequirement of physics that proofs become important.The New Testament presents a different point of view. Christ, following Hisresurrection, proved to Thomas (who became the proverbial “Doubting Thomas”)that He really was He, risen from the dead, by showing Thomas His wounds. At thesame time, however, Christ bestowed His special favor on those who believed Himwithout proof.Acceptance without proof is the fundamental characteristic of western religion.Rejection without proof is the fundamental characteristic of western science. Inother words, religion has become a matter of the heart and science has become amatter of the mind. This regrettable state of affairs does not reflect the factthat, physiologically, one cannot exist without the other. Everybody needs both.Mind and heart are only different aspects of us.Who, then, is right? Should disciples believe without proof? Should scientistsinsist on it? Is the world without substance? Is it real, but divided anddividing into countless branches?The Wu Li Masters know that “science” and “religion” are only dances, and thatthose who follow them are dancers. The dancers may claim to follow “truth” orclaim to seek “reality,” but the Wu Li Masters know better. They know that thetrue love of all dancers is dancing.image [Images/98.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"PART ONEMY WAY [dancingwulimastersthe_con01.html#pt_03]"},{"pageContent":"1THE ROLE OF “I” [dancingwulimastersthe_con01.html#ch_05]In the days before Copernicus discovered that the earth revolves around the sun,the common belief was that the sun, along with the rest of the universe,revolved around the earth. The earth was the fixed center of everything. At astill earlier time in India, this geocentric position was given to people. Thatis, each person, psychologically speaking, was recognized as being the center ofthe universe. Although this sounds like an egotistical point of view, it was notsince every person was recognized as a divine manifestation.A beautiful Hindu painting shows Lord Krishna dancing in the moonlight on thebank of the Yamuna. He moves in the center of a circle of fair Vraja women. Theyare all in love with Krishna and they are dancing with him. Krishna is dancingwith all of the souls of the world—man is dancing with himself. To dance withgod, the creator of all things, is to dance with ourselves. This is a recurrenttheme of eastern literature.This is also the direction toward which the new physics, quantum mechanics andrelativity, seems to point. From the revolutionary concepts of relativity andthe logic-defying paradoxes of quantum mechanics an ancient paradigm isemerging. In vague form, we begin to glimpse a conceptual framework in whicheach of us shares a paternity in the creation of physical reality. Our oldself-image as impotent bystander, one who sees but does not affect, isdissolving.We are watching perhaps the most engaging act in our history. Amid the powerfulpurr of particle accelerators, the click of computer printouts, and dancinginstrument gauges, the “old science” that has given us so much, including oursense of helplessness before the faceless forces of bigness, is undermining itsown foundations.With the awesome authority that we have given it, science is telling us that ourfaith has been misplaced. It appears that we have attempted the impossible, todisown our part in the universe. We have tried to do this by relinquishing ourauthority to the Scientists. To the Scientists we gave the responsibility ofprobing the mysteries of creation, change, and death. To us we gave the everydayroutine of mindless living.The Scientists readily assumed their task. We readily assumed ours, which was toplay a role of impotence before the ever-increasing complexity of “modernscience” and the ever-spreading specialization of modern technology.Now, after three centuries, the Scientists have returned with their discoveries.They are as perplexed as we are (those of them who have given thought to what ishappening).“We are not sure,” they tell us, “but we have accumulated evidence whichindicates that the key to understanding the universe is you.”This is not only different from the way that we have looked at the world forthree hundred years, it is opposite. The distinction between the “in here” andthe “out there” upon which science was founded, is becoming blurred. This is apuzzling state of affairs. Scientists, using the “in here—out there”distinction, have discovered that the “in here—out there” distinction may notexist! What is “out there” apparently depends, in a rigorous mathematical senseas well as a philosophical one, upon what we decide “in here.”The new physics tells us that an observer cannot observe without altering whathe sees. Observer and observed are interrelated in a real and fundamental sense.The exact nature of this interrelation is not clear, but there is a growing bodyof evidence that the distinction between the “in here” and the “out there” isillusion.The conceptual framework of quantum mechanics, supported by massive volumes ofexperimental data, forces contemporary physicists to express themselves in amanner that sounds, even to the uninitiated, like the language of mystics.Access to the physical world is through experience. The common denominator ofall experiences is the “I” that does the experiencing. In short, what weexperience is not external reality, but our interaction with it. This is afundamental assumption of “complementarity.”Complementarity is the concept developed by Niels Bohr to explain thewave-particle duality of light. No one has thought of a better one yet.Wave-like characteristics and particle-like characteristics, the theory goes,are mutually exclusive, or complementary aspects of light. Although one of themalways excludes the other, both of them are necessary to understand light. Oneof them always excludes the other because light, or anything else, cannot beboth wave-like and particle-like at the same time.* [footnote28.html#fn28]How can mutually exclusive wave-like and particle-like behaviors both beproperties of one and the same light? They are not properties of light. They areproperties of our interaction with light. Depending upon our choice ofexperiment, we can cause light to manifest either particle-like properties orwave-like properties. If we choose to demonstrate the wave-like characteristicsof light, we can perform the double-slit experiment which produces interference.If we choose to demonstrate the particle-like characteristics of light, we canperform an experiment which illustrates the photoelectric effect. We can causelight to manifest both wave-like properties and particle-like properties byperforming Arthur Compton’s famous experiment.In 1923, Compton played the world’s first game of billiards with subatomicparticles, and, in the process, confirmed Einstein’s seventeen-year-old photontheory of light. His experiment was not conceptually difficult. He simply firedx-rays, which everybody knows are waves, at electrons. To the surprise of mostpeople, the x-rays bounced off the electrons as if they (the x-rays) wereparticles! For example, the x-rays which struck the electrons glancing blowswere deflected only slightly from their paths. They did not lose much energy inthe collision. However, those x-rays which collided more nearly head-on withelectrons were deflected sharply. These x-rays lost a considerable amount oftheir kinetic energy (the energy of motion) in the collision.image [Images/104.jpg]Compton could tell just how much energy the deflected x-rays lost by measuringtheir frequencies before and after the collision. The frequencies of thosex-rays involved in near head-on collisions were noticeably lower after thecollision than before it. This meant that they had less energy after thecollision than they had before the collision. Compton’s x-rays were impactingwith electrons exactly the way that billiard balls impact with other billiardballs.Compton’s discovery was intimately related to quantum theory. Compton could nothave revealed the particle-like behavior of x-rays if Planck had not discoveredhis fundamental rule that higher frequency means higher energy. This rulepermitted Compton to prove that the x-rays in his experiment lost energy in aparticle-like collision (because their frequencies were lower after thecollision than before the collision).The conceptual paradox in Compton’s experiment shows how deeply thewave-particle duality is embedded in quantum mechanics. Compton proved thatelectromagnetic radiations, like x-rays, have particle-like characteristics bymeasuring their frequencies! Of course, “particles” don’t have frequencies. Onlywaves have frequencies. The phenomenon which Compton discovered is calledCompton scattering, in honor of what happens to the x-rays.In short, we can demonstrate that light is particle-like with the photoelectriceffect, that it is wave-like with the double-slit experiment, and that it isboth particle-like and wave-like with Compton scattering. Both of thesecomplementary aspects of light (wave and particle) are necessary to understandthe nature of light. It is meaningless to ask which one of them, alone, is theway light really is. Light behaves like waves or like particles depending uponwhich experiment we perform.The “we” that does the experimenting is the common link that connects light asparticles and light as waves. The wave-like behavior that we observe in thedouble-slit experiment is not a property of light, it is a property of ourinteraction with light. Similarly, the particle-like characteristics that weobserve in the photoelectric effect are not a property of light. They, too, area property of our interaction with light. Wave-like behavior and particle-likebehavior are properties of interactions.Since particle-like behavior and wave-like behavior are the only properties thatwe ascribe to light, and since these properties now are recognized to belong (ifcomplementarity is correct) not to light itself, but to our interaction withlight, then it appears that light has no properties independent of us! To saythat something has no properties is the same as saying that it does not exist.The next step is this logic is inescapable. Without us, light does not exist.Transferring the properties that we usually ascribe to light to our interactionwith light deprives light of an independent existence. Without us, or byimplication, anything else to interact with, light does not exist. Thisremarkable conclusion is only half the story. The other half is that, in asimilar manner, without light, or, by implication, anything else to interactwith, we do not exist! As Bohr himself put it:…an independent reality in the ordinary physical sense can be ascribed neitherto the phenomena nor to the agencies of observation.1By “agencies of observation,” he may have been referring to instruments, notpeople, but philosophically, complementarity leads to the conclusion that theworld consists not of things, but of interactions. Properties belong tointeractions, not to independently existing things, like “light.” This is theway that Bohr solved the wave-particle duality of light. The philosophicalimplications of complementarity became even more pronounced with the discoverythat the wave-particle duality is a characteristic of everything. When we left off telling the story of quantum mechanics, the tale had progressedas follows: In 1900, Max Planck, studying black-body radiation, discovered thatenergy is absorbed and emitted in chunks, which he called quanta. Until thattime, radiated energy, like light, was thought to be wave-like. This was becauseThomas Young, in 1803, showed that light produces interference (the double-slitexperiment), and only waves can do that.Einstein, stimulated by Planck’s discovery of quanta, used the photoelectriceffect to illustrate his theory that not only are the processes of energyabsorption and emission quantized, but that energy itself comes in packages ofcertain sizes. Thus physicists were confronted with two sets of experiments(repeatable experiences) each of which seemed to disprove the other. This is thefamous wave-particle duality which is fundamental to quantum mechanics.While physicists were trying to explain how waves can be particles, a youngFrench prince, Louis de Broglie, dropped a bomb which demolished what was leftof the classical view. Not only are waves particles, he proposed, but particlesare also waves!De Broglie’s idea (which was contained in his doctoral thesis) was that matterhas waves which “correspond” to it. The idea was more than philosophicalspeculation. It was also mathematical speculation. Using the simple equations ofPlanck and Einstein, de Broglie formulated a simple equation of his own.*[footnote29.html#fn29] It determines the wavelength of the “matter waves” that“correspond” to matter. It says simply that the greater the momentum of aparticle, the shorter is the length of its associated wave.This explains why matter waves are not evident in the macroscopic world. DeBroglie’s equation tells us that the matter waves corresponding to even thesmallest object that we can see are so incredibly small compared to the size ofthe object that their effect is negligible. However, when we get down tosomething as small as a subatomic particle, like an electron, the size of theelectron itself is smaller than the length of its associated wave!Under these circumstances, the wave-like behavior of matter should be clearlyevident, and matter should behave differently than “matter” as we are used tothinking of it. This is exactly what happens.Only two years after de Broglie presented this hypothesis, an experimenter namedClinton Davisson, working with his assistant, Lester Germer, at the BellTelephone Laboratories, verified it experimentally. Both Davisson and de Brogliegot Nobel Prizes, and physicists were left to explain not only how waves can beparticles, but also how particles can be waves.The famous Davisson-Germer experiment, which was done by accident, showedelectrons reflecting off a crystal surface in a manner that could be explainedonly if the electrons were waves. But, of course, electrons are particles.Today, electron diffraction, an apparent contradiction in terms, is a commonphenomenon. When a beam of electrons is sent through tiny openings, like thespaces between the atoms in a metal foil, which are as small or smaller than thewavelengths of the electrons (isn’t this ridiculous—“particles” don’t havewavelengths!), the beam diffracts exactly the way a beam of light diffracts.Although, classically speaking, it can’t happen, here is a picture of it.*[footnote30.html#fn30]image [Images/108.jpg]It was disconcerting enough when light, which is made of waves, began to behavelike particles, but when electrons, which are particles, began to behave likewaves, the plot became unbearably thick.The unfolding of quantum mechanics was (and still is) a drama of high suspense.Werner Heisenberg wrote:I remember discussions with Bohr [in 1927] which went through many hours tillvery late at night and ended almost in despair; and when at the end of thediscussion I went alone for a walk in the neighboring park I repeated to myselfagain and again the question: Can nature possibly be as absurd as it seemed tous in these atomic experiments.2Subsequent experiments were to reveal that not only subatomic particles, butatoms and molecules as well have associated matter waves. The title of DonaldHughes’s pioneer book, Neutron Optics, provides eloquent testimony of the mergerbetween waves and particles to which Prince de Broglie’s doctoral thesis gavebirth. Theoretically, in fact, everything has a wavelength—baseballs,automobiles, and even people—although their wavelengths are so small that theyare not noticeable.De Broglie himself was not very helpful in explaining his theory. It predictedwhat the Davisson-Germer experiment proved: that matter, like electrons, has awave-like aspect. His equation even foretold the wavelength of these waves.Nonetheless, no one knew what these waves actually were (no one does yet). DeBroglie called them waves which “correspond” to matter, but he did not explainwhat “correspond” meant.Is it possible for a physicist to predict something, calculate equations whichdescribe it, and still not know what he is talking about?Yes. As Bertrand Russell put it:Mathematics may be defined as the subject in which we never know what we aretalking about, nor whether what we are saying is true.3This is why the physicists at Copenhagen decided to accept quantum mechanics asa complete theory even though it gives no explanation of what the world is“really like,” and even though it predicts probabilities and not actual events.They accepted quantum mechanics as a complete theory because quantum mechanicscorrectly correlates experience. Quantum mechanics, and, according to thepragmatists, all science, is the study of correlations between experiences. DeBroglie’s equation correctly correlates experiences.De Broglie merged the wave-particle paradox which came to light (hissss) throughthe genius of Thomas Young (double-slit experiment) and Albert Einstein (photontheory). In other words, he connected the two most revolutionary phenomena ofphysics, the quantum nature of energy and the wave-particle duality.De Broglie presented his matter-wave theory in 1924. During the next three yearsquantum mechanics crystallized into what it essentially is today. The world ofNewtonian physics, simple mental pictures, and common sense disappeared. A newphysics took form with an originality and force that left the mind reeling.After de Broglie’s matter waves came the Schrödinger wave equation. De Broglie’s matter waves seemed to Erwin Schrödinger, the Viennese physicist, amuch more natural way of looking at atomic phenomena than Bohr’s planetary modelof the atom. Bohr’s model of hard, spherical electrons revolving around anucleus at specific levels and emitting photons by jumping from one level toanother explained the color spectrum of simple atoms, but it said nothing aboutwhy each shell contains only a certain number of electrons, no more and no less.It also did not explain how the electrons do their jumping (for example, what ishappening to them between shells).* [footnote31.html#fn31]Stimulated by de Broglie’s discovery, Schrödinger hypothesized that electronsare not spherical objects, but patterns of standing waves.Standing waves are familiar phenomena to anyone who has played with aclothesline. Suppose that we tie one end of a rope to a pole, and then pull ittight. On this rope there are no waves at all, either standing or traveling. Nowsuppose that we flick our wrist sharply downward and then upward. A hump appearsin the rope and travels down the rope to the pole where it turns upside down andreturns to our hand. This traveling hump (figure A) is a traveling wave. Bysending a series of humps down the rope, we can set up the patterns of standingwaves shown below, and more that are not shown.image [Images/111.jpg]The simplest of these is the pattern shown in figure B. This pattern is formedby the superposition of two traveling waves, a direct one and a reflected onetraveling in the opposite direction. It is the pattern, not the rope, which doesnot move. The widest point in the standing wave remains “stationary,” and so dothe points at the ends of the standing wave. These points are called nodes.There are two of them in the simplest standing pattern, one at our hand and oneat the pole where the rope is attached. These stationary patterns,superpositions of traveling waves, are called standing waves.No matter how long or short our rope is, there can be only a whole number ofstanding waves on it. That is, it can have a pattern of one standing wave, or apattern of two standing waves, or a pattern of three, four, five, and so on,standing waves but it can never have a pattern of one and one half standingwaves, or a pattern of two and one fourth standing waves. The standing wavesmust divide the rope evenly into whole sections. Another way to say this is thatwe can increase or decrease the number of standing waves on a rope only by awhole number of them. This means that the only way that the number of standingwaves on a rope can increase or decrease is discontinuously (that word, again!).Furthermore, standing waves on a rope cannot be just any size. They always willbe restricted to those lengths which divide the rope evenly. The actual size ofthe waves depends upon how long the rope is, but no matter what length the rope,there will be only certain lengths which divide it evenly.All of this was old stuff in 1925. Plucking a guitar string establishes patternsof standing waves on it. Blowing air into an organ pipe creates standing wavepatterns in it. What was new was Schrödinger’s realization that standing wavesare “quantized” the same way that atomic phenomena are! In fact, Schrödingerproposed that electrons are standing waves.In retrospect, this is not as fantastic as it first sounds. At the time,however, it was a stroke of genius. Picture an electron in orbit around anucleus. Each time the electron completes a journey around the nucleus, ittravels a certain distance. That distance is a certain length, like our rope wasa certain length. Similarly, only a whole number of standing waves, never afraction of one, can form in this length. (Length of what is an unansweredquestion.)Schrödinger proposed that each of these standing waves is an electron! In otherwords, he proposed that electrons are the segments of vibrations bounded by thenodes. A drawing of this is on the next page.So far, we have talked about standing waves on a line, like a clothesline or aguitar string, but standing waves also occur in other mediums, like water.Suppose that we throw a rock into a round pool. Waves radiate from its point ofentry. These waves are reflected, sometimes more than once, off different sidesof the pool. When the reflected traveling waves interfere with each other theycreate a complex pattern of standing waves which is our old friend,interference.Where the crest of one wave meets the trough of another wave, they cancel eachother and the surface of the water along this line of interaction is calm. Thesecalm areas are the nodes which separate the standing waves. In the double-slitexperiment, the nodes are the dark bands in the pattern of alternating light anddark areas. The light bands are the crests of the standing waves.image [Images/113.jpg]Schrödinger chose the model of a small tub of water with its complex andintricate interference pattern to explain the nature of the atom. This model is,as he put it, an “analogue” of electron waves in an atom-sized basin.The ingenious but nevertheless somewhat artificial assumptions of [Bohr’s modelof the atom]…are replaced by a much more natural assumption in de Broglie’s wavephenomena. The wave phenomenon forms the real “body” of the atom. It replacesthe individual punctiform [pointlike] electrons, which in Bohr’s model swarmaround the nucleus.4Standing waves on clotheslines have two dimensions: length and width. Standingwaves in mediums like water, or on the head of a conga drum, have threedimensions: length, width, and depth. Schrödinger analyzed the standing wavepatterns of the simplest atom, hydrogen, which has only one electron. Inhydrogen alone he calculated, using his new wave equation, a multitude ofdifferent possible shapes of standing waves. All of the standing waves on a ropeare identical. This is not true of the standing waves in an atom. All of themare three-dimensional and all of them are different. Some of them look likeconcentric circles. Some of them look like butterflies, and others look likemandalas, as in the illustration on the next page.Shortly before Schrödinger’s discovery, another Austrian physicist, WolfgangPauli, discovered that no two electrons in an atom can be exactly alike. Thepresence of an electron with one particular set of properties (“quantumnumbers”) excludes the presence of another electron with exactly the sameproperties (quantum numbers) within the same atom. For this reason, Pauli’sdiscovery became known as the Pauli exclusion principle. In terms ofSchrödinger’s standing wave theory, Pauli’s exclusion principle means that oncea particular wave pattern forms in an atom, it excludes all others of its kind.Schrödinger’s equation, modified by Pauli’s discovery, shows that there are onlytwo possible wave patterns in the lowest of Bohr’s energy levels, or shells.Therefore, there can be only two electrons in it. There are eight differentstanding-wave patterns possible in the next energy level, therefore there can beonly eight electrons in it, and so on.* [footnote32.html#fn32], †[footnote33.html#fn33]image [Images/115.jpg]From Modern College Physics, Harvey White, N.Y., Van Nostrand, 1972.These are exactly the numbers of electrons that Bohr’s model assigns to theseenergy levels. In this respect, the two models are alike. In another importantway, however, they are different. Bohr’s theory was entirely empirical. That is, he built it around theexperimentally observed facts to explain them. In contrast, Schrödinger builthis theory on de Broglie’s matter-wave hypothesis. Not only does it yieldmathematical values which have been verified experimentally, but it alsoprovides a consistent explanation for them.For example, there are only a certain number of electrons in each energy level,because there are only a certain number of standing wave patterns possible ateach energy level. The energy level of an atom jumps only from certain specificvalues to other certain specific values, because standing-wave patterns of onlycertain dimensions can form with the atom, and none other.Although Shrödinger was sure that electrons were standing waves, he was not surewhat was waving.* [footnote34.html#fn34] He was convinced, nonetheless, thatsomething was waving, and he called it psi, a Greek letter pronounced “sigh.” (A“wave function” and a “psi function” are the same thing.)To use the Schrödinger wave equation, we feed it certain characteristics of theatom in question. It then gives us the evolution in time of standing-wavepatterns which occur in the atom. If we prepare an atom in an initial state andlet it propagate in isolation, that initial state, while propagating inisolation, evolves in time into different standing-wave patterns. The order ofthese patterns is calculable. The Schrödinger wave equation is the mathematicaldevice which physicists use to calculate the order of these patterns. Saidanother way, the development of standing wave patterns in an atom isdeterministic. Given initial conditions, one pattern always follows another inaccordance with the Schrödinger wave equation.† [footnote35.html#fn35]The Schrödinger wave equation also provides a self-consistent explanation of thesize of the hydrogen atom. According to it, the wave pattern of a system withone electron and one proton, which is what we call a hydrogen atom, in itslowest energy state, has an appreciable magnitude only within a sphere which isjust the diameter of the smallest Bohr orbit. In other words, such a wavepattern turns out to be the same size as the ground state of a hydrogen atom!Although Schrödinger’s wave mechanics became a pillar of today’s quantummechanics, the useful aspects of Bohr’s model of subatomic phenomena still areused when the wave theory does not yield appropriate results. In such cases,physicists simply stop thinking in terms of standing waves and start thinkingagain in terms of particles. No one can say that they are not adaptable in thismatter (wave).Schrödinger was convinced that his equations described real things, and notmathematical abstractions. He pictured electrons as actually being spread outover their wave patterns in the form of a tenuous cloud. If the picture islimited to the one-electron hydrogen atom, whose standing waves have only threedimensions (length, width, and depth), this is possible to imagine. However, thestanding waves in an atom with two electrons exist in six mathematicaldimensions; the standing waves in an atom with four electrons exist in twelvedimensions, etc. To visualize this is quite an exercise.At this point Max Born, a German physicist, put the final touch to the new waveinterpretation of subatomic phenomena. According to him, it is not necessary orpossible to visualize these waves because they are not real things, they areprobability waves.…the whole course of events is determined by the laws of probability; to a statein space there corresponds a definite probability, which is given by the deBroglie wave associated with the state.5To obtain the probability of a given state we square (multiply by itself) theamplitude of the matter wave associated with the state.The question of whether de Broglie’s equations and Schrödinger’s equationsrepresent real things or abstractions was clear to Born. It did not make senseto him to try to think of a real thing that exists in more than threedimensions.We have two possibilities. Either we use waves in spaces of more than threedimensions…or we remain in three-dimensional space, but give up the simplepicture of the wave amplitude as an ordinary physical magnitude, and replace itby a purely abstract mathematical concept…into which we cannot enter.6This is exactly what he did. “Physics,” he wrote,is in the nature of the case indeterminate, and therefore the affair ofstatistics.7This is the same idea (probability waves) that Bohr, Kramers, and Slater hadthought of earlier. This time, however, using the mathematics of de Broglie andSchrödinger, the numbers came out right.Born’s contribution to Schrödinger’s theory is what enables quantum mechanics topredict probabilities. Since the probability of a state is found by squaring theamplitude of the matter wave associated with it, and, given initial conditions,the Schrödinger equation predicts the evolution of these wave patterns, the twotaken together give a determinable evolution of probabilities. Given any initialstate, physicists can predict the probability that an observed system will beobserved to be in any other given state at any particular time. Whether or notthe observed system is observed to be in that state, however, even if that stateis the most probable state for that time, is a matter of chance. In other words,the “probability” of quantum mechanics is the probability of observing anobserved system in a given state at a given time if it was prepared in a giveninitial state.* [footnote36.html#fn36]Thus it was that the wave aspect of quantum mechanics developed. Just as waveshave particle-like characteristics (Planck, Einstein), particles also havewave-like characteristics (de Broglie). In fact, particles can be understood interms of standing waves (Schrödinger). Given initial conditions, a preciseevolution of standing-wave patterns can be calculated via the Schrödinger waveequation. Squaring the amplitude of a matter wave (wave function) gives theprobability of the state that corresponds to that wave (Born). Therefore, asequence of probabilities can be calculated from initial conditions by using theSchrödinger wave equation and Born’s simple formula.We have come a long way from Galileo’s experiments with falling bodies. Eachstep along the path has taken us to a higher level of abstraction: first to thecreation of things that no one has ever seen (like electrons), and then to theabandonment of all attempts even to picture our abstractions. The problem is, however, that human nature being what it is, we do not stoptrying to picture these abstractions. We keep asking “What are theseabstractions of?” and then we try to visualize whatever that is.Earlier we dismissed Bohr’s planetary model of the atom with the promise that welater would see “how physicists currently think of an atom.” Well, the time hascome, but the task is a thorny one. We gave up our old picture of the atom soeasily because we assumed that it would be replaced by one more meaningful, butequally as lucid. Now it develops that our replacement picture is not a pictureat all, but an unvisualizable abstraction. This is uncomfortable because itreminds us that atoms were never “real” things anyway. Atoms are hypotheticalentities constructed to make experimental observations intelligible. No one, notone person, has ever seen an atom. Yet we are so used to the idea that an atomis a thing that we forget that it is an idea. Now we are told that not only isan atom an idea, it is an idea that we cannot even picture.Nonetheless, when physicists refer to mathematical entities in English (orGerman or Danish), the words that they use are bound to create images for laymenwho hear them, but who are not familiar with the mathematics to which theyrefer. Therefore, given this lengthy explanation of why it cannot be done, wecome now to how physicists today picture an atom.An atom consists of a nucleus and electrons. The nucleus is located at thecenter of the atom. It occupies only a small part of the atom’s volume, butalmost all of its mass. This is the same nucleus as in the planetary model. Asin the planetary model, electrons move in the general area of the nucleus. Inthis model, however, the electrons may be anywhere within an “electron cloud.”The electron cloud is made of various standing waves which surround the nucleus.These standing waves are not material. They are patterns of potential. The shapeof the various standing waves which comprise the electron cloud tells physiciststhe probability of finding the point electron at any given place in the cloud.In short, physicists still think of an atom as a nucleus around which moveelectrons, but the picture is not so simple as that of a tiny solar system. Theelectron cloud is a mathematical concept which physicists have constructed tocorrelate their experiences. Electron clouds may or may not exist within anatom. No one really knows. However, we do know that the concept of an electroncloud yields the probabilities of finding the electron at various places aroundthe nucleus of an atom, and that these probabilities have been determinedempirically to be accurate.In this sense, electron clouds are like wave functions. A wave function also isa mathematical concept which physicists have constructed to correlate theirexperiences. Wave functions may or may not “actually exist.” (This type ofstatement assumes a qualitative difference between thought and matter, which maynot be a good assumption). However, the concept of a wave function undeniablyyields the probabilities of observing a system to be in a given state at a giventime if it was prepared in a given way.Like wave functions, electron clouds generally cannot be visualized. An electroncloud containing only one electron (like the electron cloud of a hydrogen atom)exists in three dimensions. All other electron clouds, however, contain morethan one electron and therefore exist in more than three dimensions. The nucleusof the simple carbon atom, for example, with its six electrons, is surrounded byan electron cloud with eighteen dimensions. Uranium, with ninety-two electrons,has an electron cloud of two hundred and seventy-six dimensions. (Similarly, awave function contains three dimensions for each particle that it represents).The situation, in terms of mental pictures, is clearly unclear.This ambiguity results from attempting to depict with limited concepts(language) situations which are not bound by the same limitations. It also masksthe fact that we do not know what actually is going on in the invisiblesubatomic realm. The models that we use are “free creations of the human mind,”to use Einstein’s words, that satisfy our innate need to correlate experiencerationally. They are guesses about what “really” goes on inside the unopenablewatch. It is extremely misleading to think that they actually describe anything.In fact, a young German physicist, Werner Heisenberg, decided that we never canknow what actually goes on in the invisible subatomic realm, and that,therefore, we should “abandon all attempts to construct perceptual models ofatomic processes.”8 All that we legitimately can work with, according to thistheory, is what we observe directly. All we know is what we have at thebeginning of an experiment, and what we have at the end of it. Any explanationof what actually happens between these two states—which are the observables—isspeculation.Therefore, about the same time (1925), but independently of de Broglie andSchrödinger, the twenty-five-year-old Heisenberg set about developing a means oforganizing experimental data into tabular form. He was fortunate in thatsixty-six years earlier an Irish mathematician named W. R. Hamilton haddeveloped a method of organizing data into arrays, or mathematical tables,called matrices. At that time, Hamilton’s matrices were considered the fringe ofpure mathematics. Who could have guessed that one day they would fit, like aprecut piece, into the structure of a revolutionary physics?To use Heisenberg’s tables, we simply read from them, or calculate from them,what probabilities are associated with what initial conditions. Using thismethod, which Heisenberg called matrix mechanics, we deal only with physicalobservables, which means those things that we know at the beginning of anexperiment, and those things that we know about it at the end. We make nospeculation about what happens in between.After twenty-five years of struggling for a theory to replace Newtonian physics,physicists suddenly found themselves with two different theories, each one aunique way of approaching the same thing: Schrödinger’s wave mechanics, based onde Broglie’s matter waves, and Heisenberg’s matrix mechanics, based on theunanalyzability of subatomic phenomena.Within a year after Heisenberg developed his matrix mechanics, Schrödingerdiscovered that it was mathematically equivalent to his own wave mechanics.Since both of these theories were valuable tools for subatomic research, both ofthem were incorporated into the new branch of physics which became known asquantum mechanics.Much later, Heisenberg applied matrix mathematics to the particle collisionexperiments of high-energy particle physics. Because such collisions alwaysresult in a scattering of particles, it was called the Scattering Matrix, whichwas shortened to the S Matrix. Today, physicists have two ways to calculate thetransition probabilities between what they observe at the beginning of a quantummechanical experiment and what they observe at the end of it.The first method is the Schrödinger wave equation, and the second method is theS Matrix. The Schrödinger wave equation describes a temporal development ofpossibilities, one of which suddenly actualizes when we make a measurement inthe course of a quantum mechanical experiment. The S Matrix gives directly thetransition probabilities between the observables without giving any indicationof a development in time, or the lack of it, or anything else. Both of themwork.* [footnote37.html#fn37]As important as was Heisenberg’s introduction of matrix mathematics into the newphysics, his next discovery shook the very foundations of “the exact sciences.”He proved that, at the subatomic level, there is no such thing as “the exactsciences.” Heisenberg’s remarkable discovery was that there are limits beyond which wecannot measure accurately, at the same time, the processes of nature. Theselimits are not imposed by the clumsy nature of our measuring devices or theextremely small size of the entities that we attempt to measure, but rather bythe very way that nature presents itself to us. In other words, there exists anambiguity barrier beyond which we never can pass without venturing into therealm of uncertainty. For this reason, Heisenberg’s discovery became known asthe “uncertainty principle.”The uncertainty principle reveals that as we penetrate deeper and deeper intothe subatomic realm, we reach a certain point at which one part or another ofour picture of nature becomes blurred, and there is no way to reclarify thatpart without blurring another part of the picture! It is as though we areadjusting a moving picture that is slightly out of focus. As we make the finaladjustments, we are astonished to discover that when the right side of thepicture clears, the left side of the picture becomes completely unfocused andnothing in it is recognizable. When we try to focus the left side of thepicture, the right side starts to blur and soon the situation is reversed. If wetry to strike a balance between these two extremes, both sides of the picturereturn to a recognizable condition, but in no way can we remove the originalfuzziness from them.The right side of the picture, in the original formulation of the uncertaintyprinciple, corresponds to the position in space of a moving particle. The leftside of the picture corresponds to its momentum. According to the uncertaintyprinciple, we cannot measure accurately, at the same time, both the position andthe momentum of a moving particle. The more precisely we determine one of theseproperties, the less we know about the other. If we precisely determine theposition of the particle, then, strange as it sounds, there is nothing that wecan know about its momentum. If we precisely determine the momentum of theparticle, there is no way to determine its position.To illustrate this strange statement, Heisenberg proposed that we imagine asuper microscope of extraordinarily high resolving power—powerful enough, infact, to be able to see an electron moving around in its orbit. Since electronsare so small, we cannot use ordinary light in our microscope because thewavelength of ordinary light is much too long to “see” electrons, in the sameway that long sea waves barely are influenced by a thin pole sticking out of thewater.If we hold a strand of hair between a bright light and the wall, the hair castsno distinct shadow. It is so thin compared to the wavelengths of the light thatthe light waves bend around it instead of being obstructed by it. To seesomething, we have to obstruct the light waves we are looking with. In otherwords, to see something, we have to illuminate it with wavelengths smaller thanit is. For this reason, Heisenberg substituted gamma rays for visible light inhis imaginary microscope. Gamma rays have the shortest wavelength known, whichis just what we need for seeing an electron. An electron is large enough,compared to the tiny wavelength of gamma rays, to obstruct some of them: to makea shadow on the wall, as it were. This enables us to locate the electron.The only problem, and this is where quantum physics enters the picture, is that,according to Planck’s discovery, gamma rays, which have a much shorterwavelength than visible light, also contain much more energy than visible light.When a gamma ray strikes the imaginary electron, it illuminates the electron,but unfortunately, it also knocks it out of its orbit and changes its directionand speed (its momentum) in an unpredictable and uncontrollable way. (We cannotcalculate precisely the angle of rebound between a particle, like the electron,and a wave, like the gamma ray). In short, if we use light with a wavelengthshort enough to locate the electron, we cause an undeterminable change in theelectron’s momentum.The only alternative is to use a less energetic light. Less energetic light,however, causes our original problem: Light with an energy low enough not todisturb the momentum of the electron will have a wavelength so long that it willnot be able to show us where the electron is! There is no way that we can knowsimultaneously the position and the momentum of a moving particle. All attemptsto observe the electron alter the electron.This is the primary significance of the uncertainty principle. At the subatomiclevel, we cannot observe something without changing it. There is no such thingas the independent observer who can stand on the sidelines watching nature runits course without influencing it.In one sense, this is not such a surprising statement. A good way to make astranger turn and look at you is to stare intently at his back. All of us knowthis, but we often discredit what we know when it contradicts what we have beentaught is possible. Classical physics is based on the assumption that ourreality, independently of us, runs its course in space and time according tostrict causal laws. Not only can we observe it, unnoticed, as it unfolds, we canpredict its future by applying causal laws to initial conditions. In this sense,Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle is a very surprising statement.We cannot apply Newton’s laws of motion to an individual particle that does nothave an initial location and momentum, which is exactly what the uncertaintyprinciple shows us that we cannot determine. In other words, it is impossible,even in principle, ever to know enough about a particle in the subatomic realmto apply Newton’s laws of motion which, for three centuries, were the basis ofphysics. Newton’s laws do not apply to the subatomic realm.*[footnote38.html#fn38] (Newton’s concepts do not even apply in the subatomicrealm.) Given a beam of electrons, quantum theory can predict the probabledistribution of the electrons over a given space at a given time, but quantumtheory cannot predict, even in principle, the course of a single electron. Thewhole idea of a causal universe is undermined by the uncertainty principle.In a related context, Niels Bohr wrote that quantum mechanics, by its essence,entails:…the necessity of a final renunciation of the classical ideal of causality and aradical revision of our attitude toward the problem of physical reality.9Yet there is another startling implication in the uncertainty principle. Theconcepts of position and momentum are intimately bound up with our idea of athing called a moving particle. If, as it turns out, we cannot determine theposition and momentum of a moving particle, as we always have assumed that wecould, then we are forced to admit that this thing that we have been calling amoving particle, whatever it is, is not the “moving particle” we thought it was,because “moving particles” always have both position and momentum.As Max Born put it:…if we can never actually determine more than one of the two properties(possession of a definite position and of a definite momentum), and if when oneis determined we can make no assertion at all about the other property for thesame moment, so far as our experiment goes, then we are not justified inconcluding that the “thing” under examination can actually be described as aparticle in the usual sense of the term.10Whatever it is that we are observing can have a determinable momentum, and itcan have a determinable position, but of these two properties, we must choose,for any given moment, which one we wish to bring into focus. This means, inreference to “moving particles” anyway, that we can never see them the way they“really are,” but only the way we choose to see them!As Heisenberg wrote:What we observe is not nature itself, but nature exposed to our method ofquestioning.11The uncertainty principle rigorously brings us to the realization that there isno “My Way” which is separate from the world around us. It brings into questionthe very existence of an “objective” reality, as does complementarity and theconcept of particles as correlations.The tables have been turned. “The exact sciences” no longer study an objectivereality that runs its course regardless of our interest in it or not, leaving usto fare as best we can while it goes its predetermined way. Science, at thelevel of subatomic events, is no longer “exact,” the distinction betweenobjective and subjective has vanished, and the portals through which theuniverse manifests itself are, as we once knew a long time ago, those impotent,passive witnesses to its unfolding, the “I”s, of which we, insignificant we, areexamples. The Cogs in the Machine have become the Creators of the Universe.If the new physics has led us anywhere, it is back to ourselves, which, ofcourse, is the only place that we could go.image [Images/128.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"PART ONENONSENSE [dancingwulimastersthe_con01.html#pt_04]"},{"pageContent":"1BEGINNER’S MIND [dancingwulimastersthe_con01.html#ch_06]The importance of nonsense hardly can be overstated. The more clearly weexperience something as “nonsense,” the more clearly we are experiencing theboundaries of our own self-imposed cognitive structures. “Nonsense” is thatwhich does not fit into the prearranged patterns which we have superimposed onreality. There is no such thing as “nonsense” apart from a judgmental intellectwhich calls it that.True artists and true physicists know that nonsense is only that which, viewedfrom our present point of view, is unintelligible. Nonsense is nonsense onlywhen we have not yet found that point of view from which it makes sense.In general, physicists do not deal in nonsense. Most of them spend theirprofessional lives thinking along well-established lines of thought. Thosescientists who establish the established lines of thought, however, are thosewho do not fear to venture boldly into nonsense, into that which any fool couldhave told them is clearly not so. This is the mark of the creative mind; infact, this is the creative process. It is characterized by a steadfastconfidence that there exists a point of view from which the “nonsense” is notnonsense at all—in fact, from which it is obvious.In physics, as elsewhere, those who most have felt the exhilaration of thecreative process are those who best have slipped the bonds of the known toventure far into the unexplored territory which lies beyond the barrier of theobvious. This type of person has two characteristics. The first is a childlikeability to see the world as it is, and not as it appears according to what weknow about it. This is the moral of the (child’s?) tale, “The Emperor’s NewClothes.” When the emperor rode naked through the streets, only a childproclaimed him to be without clothes, while the rest of his subjects forcedthemselves to believe, because they had been told so, that he wore his finestnew clothing.The child in us is always naive, innocent in the simplistic sense. A Zen storytells of Nan-in, a Japanese master during the Meiji era who received auniversity professor. The professor came to inquire about Zen. Nan-in servedtea. He poured his visitor’s cup full, and then kept on pouring. The professorwatched the overflow until he no longer could restrain himself.“It is overfull. No more will go in!”“Like this cup,” Nan-in said, “you are full of your own opinions andspeculations. How can I show you Zen unless you first empty your cup?”Our cup usually is filled to the brim with “the obvious,” “common sense,” and“the self-evident.”Suzuki Roshi, who established the first Zen center in the United States (withouttrying, of course, which is very Zen), told his students that it is notdifficult to attain enlightenment, but it is difficult to keep a beginner’smind. “In the beginner’s mind,” he told them, “there are any possibilities, butin the expert’s there are few.” When his students published Suzuki’s talks afterhis death, they called the book, appropriately, Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind. Inthe introduction, Baker Roshi, the American Zen Master, wrote:The mind of the beginner is empty, free of the habits of the expert, ready toaccept, to doubt, and open to all the possibilities….1The beginner’s mind in science is wonderfully illustrated by the story of AlbertEinstein and his theory of relativity. That is the subject of this chapter.The second characteristic of true artists and true scientists is the firmconfidence which both of them have in themselves. This confidence is anexpression of an inner strength which allows them to speak out, secure in theknowledge that, appearances to the contrary, it is the world that is confusedand not they. The first man to see an illusion by which men have flourished forcenturies surely stands in a lonely place. In that moment of insight he, and healone, sees the obvious which to the uninitiated (the rest of the world) yetappears as nonsense or, worse, as madness or heresy. This confidence is not theobstinacy of the fool, but the surety of him who knows what he knows, and knowsalso that he can convey it to others in a meaningful way.The writer, Henry Miller, wrote:I obey only my own instincts and intuition. I know nothing in advance. Often Iput down things which I do not understand myself, secure in the knowledge thatlater they will become clear and meaningful to me. I have faith in the man whois writing, who is myself, the writer.2The songwriter Bob Dylan told a press conference:I just write a song and I know it’s going to be all right. I don’t even knowwhat it’s going to say.3An example of this kind of faith in the realm of physics was the theory of lightquanta. In 1905, the accepted and proven theory of light was that light was awave phenomenon. In spite of this, Einstein published his famous paper proposingthat light was a particle phenomenon. Heisenberg described this fascinatingsituation this way:[In 1905] light could either be interpreted as consisting of electromagneticwaves, according to Maxwell’s theory, or as consisting of light quanta, energypackets traveling through space with high velocity [according to Einstein]. Butcould it be both? Einstein knew, of course, that the well-known phenomena ofdiffraction and interference can be explained only on the basis of the wavepicture. He was not able to dispute the complete contradiction between this wavepicture and the idea of the light quanta; nor did he even attempt to remove theinconsistency of this interpretation. He simply took the contradiction assomething which would probably be understood much later.4That is exactly what happened. Einstein’s thesis led to the wave-particleduality from which quantum mechanics emerged, and with it, as we know, a way oflooking at reality and ourselves that is vastly different from that to which wewere accustomed. Although Einstein is known popularly for his theories ofrelativity, it was his paper on the quantum nature of light that won him theNobel Prize. It is also a fine example of confidence in nonsense. What is nonsense and what is not, then, may be merely a matter of perspective.“Wait a minute,” interrupts Jim de Wit. “My uncle, Weird George, believes thathe is a football. Of course, we know that this is nonsense, but Uncle Georgethinks that we are mad. He is quite certain that he is a football. He talksabout it constantly. In other words, he has abundant confidence in his nonsense.Does this make him a great scientist?No. In fact, Weird George has a problem. Not only is he the only person who hasthis particular perspective, but also this particular perspective is in no wayrelative to that of any other observer, which brings us to the heart ofEinstein’s special theory of relativity. (Einstein created two theories ofrelativity. The first theory is called the special theory of relativity. Thesecond theory, which came later and is more general, is called the generaltheory of relativity. This chapter and the next are about the first theory, thespecial theory of relativity).The special theory of relativity is not so much about what is relative as aboutwhat is not. It describes in what way the relative aspects of physical realityappear to vary, depending upon the point of view of different observers(actually depending upon their state of motion relative to each other), but, inthe process, it defines the nonchanging, absolute aspect of physical reality aswell.The special theory of relativity is not a theory that everything is relative. Itis a theory that appearances are relative. What may appear to us as a ruler(physicists say “rod”) one foot long, may appear to an observer traveling pastus (very fast) as being only ten inches long. What may appear to us as one hour,may appear to an observer traveling past us (very fast) as two hours. However,the moving observer can use the special theory of relativity to determine howour ruler and our clock appear to us (if he knows his motion relative to us)and, likewise, we can use the special theory of relativity to determine how ourstick and our clock appear to the moving observer (if we know our motionrelative to him).If we were to perform an experiment at the same moment that the moving observercame past us, both we and the moving observer would see the same experiment, buteach of us would record different times and distances, we with our rod and clockand he with his rod and clock. Using the special theory of relativity, however,each of us could transpose our data to the other’s frame of reference. The finalnumbers would come out the same for both of us. In essence, the special theoryof relativity is not about what is relative, it is about what is absolute.However, the special theory of relativity does show that appearances aredependent upon the state of motion of the observers. For example, the specialtheory of relativity tells us that (1) a moving object measures shorter in itsdirection of motion as its velocity increases until, at the speed of light, itdisappears; (2) the mass of a moving object measures more as its velocityincreases until, at the speed of light, it becomes infinite; and (3) movingclocks run more slowly as their velocity increases until, at the speed of light,they stop running altogether.All of this is from the point of view of an observer to whom the object ismoving. To an observer traveling along with the moving object, the clock keepsperfect time, ticking off sixty seconds each minute, and nothing appears to getany shorter or more massive. The special theory of relativity also tells us thatspace and time are not two separate things, but that together they formspace-time, and that energy and mass are actually different forms of the samething, mass-energy.“This is not possible!” we cry. “It is nonsense to think that increasing thevelocity of an object increases its mass, decreases its length, and slows itstime.”Our cup runneth over.These phenomena are not observable in everyday life because the velocitiesrequired to make them noticeable are those approaching the speed of light(186,000 miles per second). At the slow speeds that we encounter in themacroscopic world, these effects are virtually undetectable. If they were, wewould discover that a car traveling down the freeway is shorter than it is atrest, weighs more than it does at rest, and that its clock runs slower than itdoes at rest. In fact, we even would find that a hot iron weighs more than acold one (because energy has mass and heat is energy).How Einstein discovered all of this is another version of “The Emperor’s NewClothes.” Only Albert Einstein looked at two of the major puzzles of his day and saw themwith a beginner’s mind. The result was the special theory of relativity. Thefirst puzzle of Einstein’s time was the constancy of the speed of light. Thesecond puzzle of Einstein’s time was the uncertainty, both physical andphilosophical, about what it means to be moving or not moving.*[footnote39.html#fn39]“Wait a minute,” we say. “What is uncertain about that? If I am sitting in achair and another person walks past me, then the person walking past me is inmotion, and I, sitting in my chair, am not in motion.”“Quite right,” says Jim de Wit, appearing on cue, “but still, it is not thatsimple. Suppose that the chair in which you are sitting is on an airplane andthat the person walking past you is a stewardess. Suppose also that I am on theground watching both of you go by. From your point of view, you are at rest andthe stewardess is in motion, but from my point of view, I am at rest and both ofyou are in motion. It all depends upon your frame of reference. Your frame ofreference is the airplane, but my frame of reference is the earth.”De Wit, as usual, has discovered the problem exactly. Unfortunately, he has notsolved it. The earth itself hardly is standing still. Not only is it spinning onits axis like a top, it and the moon are revolving around a common center ofgravity while both of them circle the sun at eighteen miles per second.“That’s not fair,” we say. “Of course, it is true, but the earth does not seemto be moving to us who live on it. It is only in motion if we change our frameof reference from it to the sun. If we start playing that game, it is impossibleto find anything in the entire universe that is ‘standing still.’ From the pointof view of the galaxy, the sun is moving; from the point of view of anothergalaxy, our galaxy is moving; from the point of view of a third galaxy, thefirst two galaxies are moving. In fact, from the point of view of each of them,the others are moving.”“Nicely said,” laughs Jim de Wit, “and that is exactly the point. There is nosuch thing as something being absolutely at rest, unequivocally not moving.Motion, and the lack of it, is always relative to something else. Whether we aremoving or not depends upon what frame of reference we use.”The discussion above is not the special theory of relativity. In fact, thediscussion above is a part of the Galilean relativity principle which is overthree hundred years old. Any physical theory is a theory of relativity if, likeJim de Wit, it acknowledges the difficulty of detecting absolute motion orabsolute nonmotion. A theory of relativity assumes that the only kind of motionthat we ever can determine is motion, or lack of it, relative to something else.Galileo’s principle of relativity says, in addition, that the laws of mechanicsare equally valid in all frames of reference (physicists say “co-ordinatesystems”) that move uniformly in relation to each other.The Galilean relativity principle assumes that somewhere in the universe thereexists a frame of reference in which the laws of mechanics are completelyvalid—that is, a frame of reference in which experiment and theory agreeperfectly. This frame of reference is called an “inertial” frame of reference.An inertial frame of reference simply means a frame of reference in which thelaws of mechanics are completely valid. All other frames of reference movinguniformly, relative to an inertial frame of reference, are also inertial framesof reference. Since the laws of mechanics are equally valid in all inertialframes of reference, this means that there is no way that we can distinguishbetween one inertial frame of reference and another by performing mechanicalexperiments in them.Frames of reference moving uniformly, relative to each other, are co-ordinatesystems that move with a constant speed and direction. In other words, they areframes of reference that move with a constant velocity. For example, if, byaccident, we drop a book while standing in line at the library, the book fallsdirectly downward in accordance with Newton’s law of gravity, and strikes theground directly beneath the place from which it was dropped. Our frame ofreference is the earth. The earth is moving at a fantastic speed on its triparound the sun, but this speed is constant.* [footnote40.html#fn40]If we drop the same book while we are traveling on an ideally smooth train whichis moving at a constant speed, the same thing happens. The book falls directlydownward in accordance with Newton’s laws of gravitation, and strikes the floorof the train directly beneath the place from which it was dropped. This time,our frame of reference is the train. Because the train is moving uniformly, withno increases or decreases of speed, in relation to the earth, and because theearth is moving in a similar manner in relation to the train, the two frames ofreference are moving uniformly relative to each other, and the laws of mechanicsare valid in both of them. It does not matter in the least which of the framesof reference is “moving.” A person in either frame of reference can considerhimself moving and the other frame of reference at rest (the earth is at restand the train is moving) or the other way round (the train is at rest and theearth is moving). From the point of view of physics, there is no difference.What happens if the engineer suddenly accelerates while we are doing ourexperiment? Then, of course, everything is upset. The falling book still willstrike the floor of the train, but at a spot farther back since the floor of thetrain has moved forward beneath the book while it was falling. In this case, thetrain is not moving uniformly in relation to the earth, and the Galileanrelativity principle does not apply.Provided that all of the motion involved is uniformly relative, we can translatemotion as perceived in one frame of reference into another frame of reference.For example, suppose that we are standing on the shore watching a ship move pastus at thirty miles per hour. The ship is a frame of reference moving uniformlyrelative to us. There is a passenger, a man, standing on the deck of the ship,leaning against the railing. Since he is standing still, his velocity is thesame as that of the ship, thirty miles per hour. (From his point of view, we aremoving past him at thirty miles per hour).Suppose now that the man begins to walk toward the front of the ship at threemiles per hour. His velocity now, relative to us, is thirty-three miles perhour. The ship carries him forward at thirty miles per hour, and his walkingadds three miles per hour to that. (You get to the top of an escalator faster ifyou walk.)Suppose that the man turns around and walks back toward the rear of the ship.His velocity relative to the ship is, again, three miles per hour, but hisvelocity relative to the shore is now twenty-seven miles per hour.In other words, to calculate how fast this passenger moves relative to us, weadd his velocity to the velocity of his co-ordinate system (the ship) if he iswalking in the same direction that it is moving, and we subtract his velocityfrom the velocity of his co-ordinate system if he is walking in the oppositedirection. This calculation is called a classical (Galilean) transformation.Knowing the uniform relative motion of our two frames of reference, we cantransform the passenger’s velocity in reference to his own co-ordinate system(three miles per hour) into his velocity in reference to our co-ordinate system(thirty-three miles per hour).The freeway provides abundant examples of classical transformations from oneframe of reference to another. Suppose that we are driving at 75 miles per hour.We see a truck coming toward us. Its speedometer also reads 75 miles per hour.Making a classical transformation, we can say that, relative to us, the truck isapproaching at 150 miles per hour, which explains why head-on collisions sooften are fatal.Suppose now that a car going in the same direction that we are going passes us.His speedometer reads 110 miles per hour (it’s a Ferrari). Again, making aclassical transformation, we can say that, relative to us, the Ferrari isdeparting our location at 35 miles per hour.The transformation laws of classical mechanics are common sense. They say that,even though we cannot determine whether a frame of reference is absolutely atrest or not, we can translate velocities (and positions) from one frame ofreference into velocities (and positions) in other frames of reference, providedthat the frames of reference are moving uniformly, relative to each other.Furthermore, the Galilean relativity principle, from which Galileantransformations come, says that if the laws of mechanics are valid in any oneframe of reference, they also are valid in any other frame of reference movinguniformly relative to it.Unfortunately, there is one catch in all this. No one yet has found aco-ordinate system in which the laws of mechanics are valid! *[footnote41.html#fn41]“What! Impossible! Can’t be!” we cry, aghast. “What about the earth?”Well, it is true that Galileo, who first probed the laws of classical mechanics,used the earth as a frame of reference, although not consciously. (The idea ofco-ordinate systems did not come along until Descartes). However, our presentmeasuring devices are more accurate than Galileo’s, who occasionally even usedhis pulse (which means that the more excited he got, the more inaccurate hismeasurements became!). Whenever we reconstruct Galileo’s falling bodyexperiments, we always find discrepancies between the theoretical results thatwe should get and the experimental results that we actually do get. Thesediscrepancies are due to the rotation of the earth. The bitter truth is that thelaws of mechanics are not valid for a co-ordinate system rigidly attached to theearth. The earth is not an inertial frame of reference. Since their veryinception, the poor laws of classical mechanics have been left, so to speak,without a home. No one has discovered a co-ordinate system in which theymanifest themselves perfectly.This leaves us, from a physicist’s point of view, in a pretty mess. On the onehand, we have the laws of classical mechanics, which are indispensable tophysics, and, on the other hand, these same laws are predicated upon aco-ordinate system which may not even exist.This problem is related to relativity, which is the problem of determiningabsolute nonmotion, in an intimate way. If such a thing as absolute nonmotionwere detected, then a co-ordinate system attached to it would be the long-lostinertial frame of reference, the co-ordinate system in which the classical lawsof mechanics are perfectly valid. Then everything would make sense againbecause, given a frame of reference in which the classical laws of mechanics arevalid, any frame of reference, the classical laws of mechanics at last wouldhave a permanent mailing address.Physicists do not enjoy theories with loose ends. Before Einstein, the problemof detecting absolute motion (or absolute non-motion—if we find one, we find theother), and the problem of finding an inertial co-ordinate system were, to saythe least, loose ends. The entire structure of classical mechanics was based onthe fact that somewhere, somehow, there must be a frame of reference in whichthe laws of classical mechanics are valid. The inability of physicists to findit made classical mechanics appear exactly like a huge castle built on sand.Although no one, including Einstein, discovered absolute non-motion, theinability to detect it was a major concern of Einstein’s day. The second majorcontroversy of Einstein’s day (not counting Planck’s discovery of the quantum)was an incomprehensible, logic-defying characteristic of light. In the course of their experiments with the speed of light, physicistsdiscovered something very strange. The speed of light disregards thetransformation laws of classical mechanics. Of course, that’s impossible, butnevertheless, experiment after experiment proved just the opposite. The speed oflight just happens to be the most nonsensical thing ever discovered. That isbecause it never changes.“So light always travels at the same speed,” we ask, “what’s so strange aboutthat?”“Oh my, oh my,” says a distraught physicist, circa 1887, “you simply don’tunderstand the problem. The problem is that no matter what the circumstances ofthe measurement, no matter what the motion of the observer, the speed of lightalways measures 186,000 miles per second.”* [footnote42.html#fn42]“Is this bad?” we say, beginning to sense that something is strange here.“Worse,” says the physicist. “It’s impossible. Look,” he tells us, trying tocalm himself, “suppose that we are standing still and that somewhere in front ofus is a light bulb that also is standing still. The light bulb flashes on andoff and we measure the velocity of the light that comes from it. What do yousuppose that velocity will be?”“186,000 miles per second,” we answer, “the speed of light.”“Correct!” says the physicist, with a knowing look that makes us uncomfortable.“Now, suppose the light bulb still is standing still, but we are moving towardit at 100,000 miles per second. Now what will we measure the speed of the lightto be?”“286,000 miles per second,” we answer, “the speed of light (186,000 miles persecond) plus our speed (100,000 miles per second).” (This is a typical exampleof a classical transformation.)“Wrong!” shouts the physicist. “That’s just the point. The speed of the light isstill 186,000 miles per second.”“Wait a minute,” we say. “That can’t be. You say that if the light bulb is atrest and we are at rest, the speed of photons emitted from it will measure thesame to us as the speed of photons emitted from it when we are rushing towardthe light bulb? That doesn’t make sense. When the photons are emitted, they aretraveling at 186,000 miles per second. If we also are moving, and moving towardthem, their velocity should measure that much faster. In fact, they shouldappear to be traveling with the speed at which they were emitted plus our speed.Their velocity should measure 186,000 miles per second plus 100,000 miles persecond.”“True,” says our friend, “but it doesn’t. It measures 186,000 miles per second,just as if we still were standing still.”Pausing for that to sink in, he continues, “Now consider the opposite situation.Suppose that the light bulb still is standing still, and this time we are movingaway from it at 100,000 miles per second. What will the velocity of the photonsmeasure now?”“86,000 miles per second?” we say, hopefully, “the speed of light minus ourspeed as we move away from the approaching photons?”“Wrong, again!” exclaims our friend again. “It should, but it doesn’t. The speedof the photons still measures 186,000 miles per second.”“This is very hard to believe. Do you mean that if a light bulb is at rest andwe measure the speed of the photons emitted from it while we also are at rest,and if we then measure the speed of the photons from it while we are movingtoward it, and lastly, if we measure the speed of the photons emitted from itwhile we are moving away from it, we get the same result in all three cases?”“Exactly!” says the physicist. “186,000 miles per second.”*[footnote43.html#fn43]“Do you have any evidence?” we ask him.“Unfortunately,” he says, “I do. Two American physicists, Albert Michelson andEdward Morley, have just completed an experiment which seems to show that thespeed of light is constant, regardless of the state of motion of the observer.“This can’t happen,” he sighs, “but it is happening. It just doesn’t makesense.” The problem of absolute nonmotion and the problem of the constancy of the speedof light converged in the Michelson-Morley experiment. The Michelson-Morleyexperiment (1887) was a crucial experiment. A crucial experiment is anexperiment which determines the life or death of a scientific theory. The theorythat was tested by the Michelson-Morley experiment was the theory of the ether.The theory of the ether was that the entire universe lies in and is permeated byan invisible, tasteless, odorless substance that has no properties at all, andexists simply because it has to exist so that light waves can have something topropagate in. For light to travel as waves, according to the theory, somethinghas to be waving. That something was the ether. The theory of the ether was thelast attempt to explain the universe by explaining something. Interpreting theuniverse in terms of things (like the Great Machine idea) was the distinguishingcharacteristic of the mechanical view, which means all of physics from Newtonuntil the middle 1800s.The ether, according to the theory, is everywhere and in everything. We live andperform our experiments in a sea of ether. To the ether, the hardest substanceis as porous as a sponge to water. There are no doors to the ether. Although wemove in the ether sea, the ether sea does not move. It is absolutely,unequivocally not moving.Therefore, although the primary reason for the existence of the ether was togive light something to propagate through, its existence also solved the oldproblem of locating the original inertial coordinate system, that frame ofreference in which the laws of mechanics are completely valid. If the etherexisted (and it had to exist), the co-ordinate system attached to it was theco-ordinate system against which all others could be compared to see if theywere moving or not.The findings of Michelson and Morley gave a verdict of death to the theory ofthe ether.* [footnote44.html#fn44] Equally important, they led to themathematical foundations of Einstein’s revolutionary new theory.The idea of the Michelson-Morley experiment was to determine the motion of theearth through the ether sea. The problem was how to do this. Two ships at seacan determine their motion relative to one another, but if only one ship movesthrough a smooth sea, it has no reference point against which to measure itsprogress. In the old days, seamen would throw a log overboard and measure theirprogress relative to it. Michelson and Morley did the same thing, except thatthe log that they threw overboard was a beam of light.Their experiment was conceptually simple and ingenious. If the earth is moving,they reasoned, and the ether sea is at rest, then the movement of the earththrough the ether sea must cause an ether breeze. Therefore, a beam of lighttraveling against the ether breeze should have a slower velocity than a beam oflight sent across the ether breeze. This is the essence of the Michelson-Morleyexperiment.Every pilot knows that it takes longer to fly a given distance if one leg of thetrip is against a head wind (even though the return leg is with a tail wind)than it takes to fly the same distance across the same wind. Similarly, thoughtMichelson and Morley, if the theory of the ether sea is correct, a light beamsent upstream against the ether breeze and then downstream with it will takelonger to return to its starting point than a light beam sent back and forthacross the either breeze.To establish and detect this difference in velocity, Michelson and Morleycreated a device called an interferometer (from the word “interference”). It wasdesigned to detect the interference pattern created by the two beams of light asthey returned to a common point. (A diagram is on the next page.)A light source emits a beam of light toward a half-silvered mirror (similar tothe lenses in sunglasses that look like a mirror on one side, but aretransparent from the other side). The original beam of light image[Images/ar.jpg] is split by the half-silvered mirror into two segments image[Images/arrow.jpg] image [Images/arrow1.jpg], each of which travels an equaldistance, but at right angles to each other, and back again. The two beams thenreunite via the same half-silvered mirror and travel image [Images/arr.jpg] intoa measuring device. By observing the interference created by these convergingbeams in the measuring device, any difference in velocity between them can bedetermined accurately.When the experiment was performed, not the slightest difference in velocitycould be detected between the two beams of light. The interferometer was turned90 degrees so that the beam going against the ether wind now was directed acrossit, and the beam going across the ether wind now was sent directly into it.Again not the slightest difference in velocity between the two beams could bedetected.image [Images/147.jpg]In other words, the Michelson-Morley experiment had failed to prove theexistence of the ether. Unless an explanation could be found, physicists wouldbe faced with choosing between two unsettling alternatives: either (1) the earthis not moving (and Copernicus was wrong), or (2) the ether does not exist.Neither of these was very acceptable.Michelson and Morley thought that perhaps the earth carried a layer of etherwith it as it moved through the ether set, just as it carries its atmospherewith it as it travels through space and, therefore, close to the surface of theearth, the ether breeze cannot be detected. No one had a better hypothesis untilan Irishman named George Francis FitzGerald proposed (in 1892) an outrageousexplanation.FitzGerald reasoned that perhaps the pressure of the ether wind compressesmatter just as an elastic object moving through water becomes shortened in thedirection that it is traveling. If this were true, then the arm of theinterferometer pointing into the ether wind would be somewhat shorter than thearm that is not pointing into it. Therefore, a reduction in the velocity of thelight traveling into the ether wind and back might not be detected because thedistance that the light travels also is reduced. In fact, if the amount by whichthe interferometer arm pointing into the ether wind is shortened justcorresponds to the amount by which the velocity of the light traveling up thatarm and back is reduced, then both beams of light in the experiment will reachthe measuring device at exactly the same time (the beam with the higher velocitytraversing a greater distance in the same time that the beam with the slowervelocity traverses a lesser distance).FitzGerald’s hypothesis had a major advantage over all the others. It wasimpossible to disprove. It said simply that there is a one-dimensionalcontraction (in the direction of motion) that increases as velocity increases.The catch is that everything contracts. If we want to measure the length of anobject that is moving very fast compared to the speed of light, we have to catchup with it first, and when we do, according to the theory, the measuring stickthat we are carrying with us also contracts. If the object measured seventeeninches at rest, it still would measure seventeen inches. Nor would anything lookcontracted because the lenses in our eyes also would contract, distorting themjust enough to make everything look normal.One year later a Dutch physicist, Hendrik Antoon Lorentz, while working onanother problem, independently arrived at FitzGerald’s hypothesis. Lorentz,however, expressed his discovery in rigorous mathematical terms. This, ofcourse, upgraded FitzGerald’s hypothesis to a position of respectability and itbegan to gain a surprising degree of acceptance, considering its fantasy-likequality. Lorentz’s mathematical formulations of the FitzGerald-Lorentzcontraction became known as the Lorentz transformations.The stage was now set. All of the scenery was in place. The failure to detectthe ether. The Michelson-Morley experiment.* [footnote45.html#fn45] Theconstancy of the speed of light. The FitzGerald-Lorentz contractions. TheLorentz transformations. These are the facts that continued to confusephysicists at the beginning of the century. All of them but Albert Einstein.When he looked at these pieces of scenery, what his beginner’s mind saw was thespecial theory of relativity."},{"pageContent":"1SPECIAL NONSENSE [dancingwulimastersthe_con01.html#ch_07]Einstein’s first professional act, upon reviewing the facts, was the equivalentof saying, “But the Emperor’s not wearing any clothes!” except what he said was,“The ether does not exist.”1 The first message of the special theory ofrelativity is that since the ether is undetectable and, in effect, useless,there is no reason to continue to search for it. It is undetectable becauseevery attempt to measure it or determine its quality, culminating with theMichelson-Morley experiment, failed utterly even to indicate its presence. It isuseless because light propagation can be envisioned as the propagation of energythrough empty space (in vacuo) according to Maxwell’s field equations as well asit can be envisioned as a disturbance of the ether medium. Einstein statedclearly what already was implicit in Maxwell’s equations. (Maxwell was thediscoverer of the electromagnetic field.) “The electromagnetic fields,” hewrote, “are not states of a medium [the ether] and are not bound down to anybearer, but they are independent realities which are not reducible to anythingelse…”2 This assertion was supported by the inability of physicists to detectthe ether.With this statement, Einstein brought to a close the illustrious history ofmechanics, the idea that physical events are explicable in terms of things.Classical mechanics is the story of objects and forces between them. It was aremarkable break from a three-century-old tradition to assert blatantly, in theearly 1900s, that electromagnetic fields involve no object whatever, that theyare not states of the ether medium, but “ultimate, irreducible realities”3 inthemselves. Henceforth, as in quantum mechanics, there would be no concreteimagery associated with physical theory.Both relativity and quantum theory heralded the unprecedented remoteness fromexperience which has characterized physical theory ever since. In fact, thetrend is continuing. As though governed by an inexorable law, physics isbecoming more and more abstract as it covers wider and wider tracts ofexperience. Only the future will tell if this trend is reversible.The second victim of Einstein’s inability to see clothes that weren’t there wasabsolute nonmotion. Why should we make one particular frame of reference“privileged”4 in respect to all others by saying that it alone absolutely is notmoving? It may be desirable theoretically, but since such a frame of referencedoes not constitute a part of our experience, it should be disregarded. It is“intolerable”5 to place in a theoretical structure a characteristic which has nocorresponding characteristic in our system of experience.In one stroke, Einstein eliminated the two major physical and philosophicalblocks to a radically new way of perceiving reality. With no ether and noconcept of absolute motion to confuse the situation, the situation became muchsimpler.Einstein’s next step was to confront the puzzle which had come to light (no pun)in the Michelson-Morley experiment, namely, the constancy of the speed of light.How could the speed of light always be 186,000 miles per second regardless ofthe state of motion of the observer?In an ingenious mental turnaround, Einstein turned this puzzle into a postulate!Instead of worrying, for the moment, about how it can happen, he simply acceptedthe experimentally irrefutable fact that it does happen. This evident (to us)recognition of the obvious was the first step in a logical process, which, onceset in motion, was to explain not only the puzzle of the constant speed oflight, but a great deal more.The puzzle of the constancy of the velocity of light became the principle of theconstancy of the velocity of light. The principle of the constancy of thevelocity of light is the first foundation stone of the special theory ofrelativity.The principle of the constancy of the velocity of light is that whenever we makea measurement of the velocity of light, regardless of whether we are in motionor at rest relative to the light source, we always get the same result. Thespeed of light is invariably 186,000 miles per second.* [footnote46.html#fn46]This is what Michelson and Morley discovered in their famous experiment.From the point of view of classical mechanics, the principle of the constancy ofthe velocity of light makes no sense at all. In fact, it conflicts violentlywith common sense. Before Einstein, the totalitarian grasp of “common sense”held the constancy of the speed of light to the status of a paradox. (Wheneverwe bump into the limits of our self-imposed cognitive reality, the result isalways paradox.) It took a pure beginner’s mind, such as Albert Einstein’s, toaccept that if what is, is (the constancy of the velocity of light), then commonsense must be wrong.The most important victim of Einstein’s beginner’s mind was the whole structureof classical (Galilean) transformations, that sweet but illusory fruit of acommon sense anchored in macroscopic dimensions and velocities. To give upcommon sense is not an easy task. Einstein was the first person to do it in sucha wholesale manner that his perception of the very nature of space and timechanged radically. Moreover, when all was said and done, Einstein’s vision ofspace and time turned out to be more useful than that of common sense. The second foundation stone of the special theory of relativity is the principleof relativity. When Einstein dismissed the idea of absolute nonmotion, histheory became, ipso facto, a theory of relativity. Since there was no betterprinciple of relativity to be had than Galileo’s, Einstein simply borrowed it,but first, of course, he brought it up to date.Galileo’s principle of relativity says that the laws of mechanics (such as thelaws governing falling bodies) that are valid in one frame of reference arevalid in all frames of reference that move uniformly (without jerkiness) inrelation to it. Another way of saying the same thing is that it is impossible todetermine, by doing experiments involving the laws of mechanics, whether or notour frame of reference is moving or at rest in relation to another frame ofreference in which the laws of mechanics also are valid.Einstein expanded the Galilean relativity principle to include all the laws ofphysics, and not just the laws of classical mechanics. In particular he includedthe laws governing electromagnetic radiation, which were unknown in Galileo’stime.Einstein’s updated principle of relativity, then, is that all the laws of natureare exactly identical in all frames of references that move uniformly relativeto each other and that, therefore, there is no way of distinguishing absoluteuniform motion (or nonmotion).In short, the two foundation stones of the special theory of relativity are theprinciple of the constancy of the velocity of light (the Michelson-Morleyexperiment) and the principle of relativity (Galileo). Said more specifically,the special theory of relativity rests upon these two postulates: 1. The velocity of light in a vacuum is the same in all frames of reference (for all observers) moving uniformly, relative to each other, and 2. All laws of nature are the same in all frames of reference moving uniformly, relative to each other.Of these two postulates, the first one, the principle of the constancy of thevelocity of light, is the troublemaker. There is no way that it and theclassical transformation laws both can be true. According to the classicaltransformation laws (and common sense) the speed of light must be its velocityas it is emitted from a source plus or minus the velocity of the observer, ifthe observer is moving toward the source or away from the source. According toexperiment, the speed of light remains constant regardless of the state ofmotion of the observer. Common sense and experimental findings are in violentdisagreement.Einstein’s beginner’s mind told him that, since we cannot argue with what is(the experimental evidence), then our common sense must be wrong. With thisdecision to disregard common sense and to base his new theory on the onlyclothes he could see that the emperor was wearing (the constant speed of lightand the principle of relativity) Einstein stepped boldly into the unknown, infact, into the unimaginable. Already on new territory, he proceeded to explorewhere no person had gone before.How could it be that to every observer the speed of light is the same regardlessof their state of motion? To measure speed, it is necessary to use a clock andruler (a rigid rod). If the speed of light as measured by an observer at restrelative to a light source is the same as the speed of light as measured by anobserver in motion relative to the source, then it must be that, somehow, themeasuring instruments change from one frame of reference to the other in justsuch a way that the speed of light always appears to be the same.The speed of light appears constant because the rods and clocks used to measureit vary from one frame of reference to another depending upon their motion. Inshort, to an observer at rest, a moving rod changes its length and a movingclock changes its rhythm. At the same time, to an observer traveling along witha moving rod and clock, there is no apparent change at all in length or rhythm.Therefore, both observers measure the speed of light to be the same, and neithercan detect anything unusual in the measurement or in the measuring apparatus.This is very similar to the case of the Michelson-Morley experiment. Accordingto FitzGerald and Lorentz, the arm of the interferometer that faces into theether wind (now dismissed from our theory) is shortened by the pressure of theether wind. Therefore, the light that travels the interferometer arm facing intothe “ether wind” has less distance to travel and more time to do it in than doesthe light traveling the other arm. As a result, the speed of light travelingboth arms appears to be the same. This is what the Lorentz transformationsdescribe. Come to think of it, the Lorentz transformations can be used todescribe contractions due to motion as well as contractions due to a fictitiousether wind.FitzGerald and Lorentz imagined that rigid rods were compressed under thepressure of the ether wind, but according to Einstein, it is motion itself thatcauses contraction, and, in addition, time dilation.Here is another way of looking at it. A “constant velocity of light” is exactlywhat would result if moving measuring rods became shorter and moving clocks ranmore slowly because a moving observer would measure the speed of light with ashorter measuring rod (less distance for the light to travel) and a slower clock(more time to do it in) than an observer at rest. Each observer, however, wouldconsider his own rod and clock to be quite normal and unimpaired. Therefore,both observers would find the speed of light to be 186,000 miles per second andboth of them would be puzzled by this fact if they were still bound by theclassical transformation laws.These were the initial fruits of Einstein’s basic assumptions (the principle ofthe constancy of the velocity of light and the principle of relativity): First,a moving object appears to contract in its direction of motion and becomeshorter as its velocity increases until, at the speed of light, it disappearsaltogether. Second, a moving clock runs more slowly than a clock at rest andcontinues to slow its rhythm as its velocity increases until, at the speed oflight, it stops running altogether.These effects only appear to a “stationary” observer; one who is at restrelative to the moving clock and rod. They do not appear to an observer who istraveling along with the clock and rod. To make this clear, Einstein introducedthe labels “proper” and “relative.” What we see when we observe our stationaryrod and our stationary clock, if we ourselves are stationary, is their properlength and proper time. (“Proper” means “one’s own.”) Proper lengths and propertimes always appear normal. What we see if we are stationary and observe a rodand a clock traveling very fast relative to us is the relative length of themoving rod and the relative time of the moving clock. The relative length isalways shorter than the proper length, and the relative time is always slowerthan the proper time.The time that you see on your own watch is your proper time, and the time thatyou see on the watch of the person moving past you is the relative time (whichappears to you—not to the person moving past you—to run more slowly). The lengthof the measuring rod in your own hand is its proper length, and the length ofthe measuring rod in the hand of the person moving past you is its relativelength (which appears to you—but not to the other person—to be shorter). Fromthe point of view of the person moving past you, he is at rest, you are moving,and the situation is reversed.Suppose that we are aboard a spacecraft outward bound on an exploration. We havemade arrangements to press a button every fifteen minutes to send a signal backto earth. As our speed steadily increases our earthbound colleagues notice thatinstead of every fifteen minutes, our signals begin to arrive seventeen minutesapart, and then twenty-five minutes apart. After several days, our colleagues,to their distress, find that our signals arrive every two days. As our velocitycontinues to increase our signals become years apart. Eventually, generations ofearthlings come and go between our signals.Meanwhile, on the spacecraft, we are entirely unaware of the predicament back onearth. As far as we are concerned, everything is proceeding according to plan,although we are becoming bored with the routine of pressing a button everyfifteen minutes. When we return to earth, a few years older (our proper time) wemay find that we have been gone, according to earth time, for centuries (theirrelative time). Exactly how long depends upon how fast we have been going.This scene is not science fiction. It is based upon a well-known (to physicists)phenomenon called the Twin Paradox of the special theory of relativity. Part ofthe paradox is that one twin remains on earth while the other goes on a spacevoyage and returns younger than his brother.There are many examples of proper time and relative time. Suppose that we are ina space station observing an astronaut who is traveling at a speed of 161,000miles per second relative to us. As we watch him, we notice a certainsluggishness in his movements, as though he were moving in slow motion. We alsonotice that everything in his spaceship also seems to function in slow motion.His rolled cigarette, for example, lasts twice as long as one of ours.Of course, part of his sluggishness is due to the fact that he is fastincreasing the distance between us, and with each passing moment, it takes thelight from his spaceship longer to reach us. Nonetheless, after makingallowances for the travel time of the light involved, we find that the astronautstill is moving more slowly than usual.However, to the astronaut, it is we who are zipping past him at 161,000 milesper second, and after he makes all the necessary allowances, he finds that it iswe who are sluggish. Our cigarette lasts twice as long as his.This situation could be the ultimate illustration of how the grass is alwaysgreener on the other side. Each man’s cigarette lasts twice as long as theother’s. (Unfortunately, so does each man’s trip to the dentist.)The time that we ourselves experience and measure is our proper time. Ourcigarette lasts the normal length of time. The time that we measure for theastronaut is the relative time. His cigarette appears to last twice as long asours because his time passes twice as slowly. The situation is similar regardingproper lengths and relative lengths. From our point of view, the astronaut’scigarette, provided that it is pointing in the direction that his spaceship ismoving, is shorter than our own cigarette.The other side of the coin is that the astronaut sees himself as stationary andhis cigarettes as normal. He also sees us as traveling at 161,000 miles persecond relative to him, and our cigarettes as shorter than his and slowerburning.Einstein’s theory has been substantiated in many ways. All of them verify itwith awesome accuracy.The most common verifications of time dilation come from high-energy particlephysics. A very light elementary particle, called a muon (pronounced moo’on), iscreated at the top of the earth’s atmosphere by the collision of protons (oneform of “cosmic radiation”) and air molecules. We know from experiments in whichmuons are created in accelerators that they live a very short time. By no meansdo they live long enough to reach the earth from the upper atmosphere. Longbefore the time it takes to traverse this distance, they should decayspontaneously into other types of particles. Yet this does not happen because wedetect them in abundance here at the earth’s surface.Why do the muons created by cosmic radiation live longer, in fact, seven timeslonger than those muons created in the laboratory? The answer is that the muonsproduced by collisions of cosmic radiation and air molecules travel much fasterthan any muons that we can create experimentally. Their velocity isapproximately 99 percent of the speed of light. At that speed, time dilation isquite noticeable. They do not live longer than usual from their point of view,but from our point of view they live seven times longer than they would atslower velocities.This is true not only of muons, but of almost all subatomic particles, and thereare many of them. For example, pions (pie’ons), another type of subatomicparticle, which move at 80 percent of the speed of light, live, on the average,1.67 times as long as slow pions. The special theory of relativity tells us thatthe intrinsic lifetime of these high-speed particles does not increase, but thattheir relative rate of time flow slows down. The special theory of relativityalso made the calculation of these phenomena possible long before we had thetechnical capability to create them.In 1972, four of the most accurate atomic clocks available were put aboard anaircraft and flown around the world. At the end of the trip, they were found tobe slightly behind their stationary, earthbound counterparts with which theywere synchronized before the flight.* [footnote47.html#fn47] The next time thatyou fly, remember that, even if minutely, your watch is running slower, yourbody had more mass, and, if you stand facing the cockpit, you are thinner.According to the special theory of relativity, a moving object appears tocontract in the direction of motion as its velocity increases. James Terrell, aphysicist, has demonstrated mathematically that this phenomenon is somethinglike a visual illusion, and, in fact, is analogous to a projection of the realworld onto the wall of Plato’s cave.6Plato’s famous parable of the cave describes a group of people who are chainedinside a cave in such a way that they can see only the shadows on the wall ofthe cave. These shadows are the only world that these people know. One day oneof these people escapes into the world outside the cave. At first he is blindedby the sunlight, but when he recovers, he realizes that this is the real world,and what he previously considered to be the real world was, in fact, only theprojection of the real world onto the wall of the cave. (Unfortunately, when hereturned to the people who still were chained inside the cave, they thought hewas mad.)Figure A, on the next page, depicts a view looking down on the top of our headand the top of a sphere. The lines connect our eyes with points on either sideof the sphere. If we are far enough away from the sphere, the distance betweenthese points is almost equal to the diameter of the sphere. Figure A is drawn asif the artist were looking down on the top of our head, our eyes, and thesphere.The first step in Terrell’s explanation is to draw lines downward (back into thepage) from each of the two points on the sphere to a screen directly below thesphere. Figure B is a side view showing the two points, the lines that we havedrawn downward, and the screen. (If you hold this book directly in front of you,your eyes are in the same position relative to the dotted lines as the eyesdrawn in Figure A.)To understand Terrell’s explanation, suppose that the sphere is moving very fastrelative to the speed of light from right to left. If the sphere moves fastenough, some very interesting things happen. For example, before the light fromthe point on the far left edge of the sphere can reach us, the ball moves infront of it, blocking it from our vision! The reverse happens on the far right.The ball moves out from between us and the light signals originating from pointsthat used to be on the “back” side of the ball. These signals now are visible tous, while the signals coming from the point that used to be on the leading edgeof the ball now are blocked by the ball itself as it moves to the left. Theeffect of this is an illusion of sorts. What we see is the same thing that wewould see if someone had rotated the ball around its axis!image [Images/160.jpg]Look what happened to the distance between the two points as projected on thescreen. It is considerably less than when we started. The equations in thespecial theory of relativity (the Lorentz transformations) which show acontraction due to motion describe these projections. (Is this beginning tosound like Plato’s cave?)The fact that the ball, by moving fast enough, gets in the way of some of itsown light signals and out of the way of others causes the ball to appear torotate. This causes the projected distance between any two points on it whichare aligned with the direction of motion to decrease, just as if someone reallyhad rotated the ball. The faster the ball moves, the more it appears to“rotate,” and the closer together come the points projected on the screen. It isthe projection that contracts. Instead of “screen” substitute “view of the ballfrom our frame of reference” and we have the Terrell explanation of relativisticcontraction.As yet, no analogous explanations have been found for the time dilation thataccompanies moving clocks or the increase of mass that accompanies movingobjects, but the effort, relatively speaking, is young. The special theory of relativity shows that the mass of a moving objectincreases as the velocity of the object increases. Newton would not havehesitated to call this nonsense, but then Newton’s experience was limited tovelocities that are quite slow compared to the speed of light.Classic physics tells us that a specific amount of force is required to increasethe velocity of a moving object by a given amount, for example, one foot persecond. Once we know what that amount of force is, whenever we want to increasethe velocity of that particular object by one foot per second, all we need do isapply that amount of force to it. If the object has a velocity of 100 feet persecond, that specific amount of force will increase its velocity to 101 feet persecond. According to Newton’s physics, the same amount of force that increasesthe velocity of an object from 100 feet per second to 101 feet per second alsowill increase the velocity of the same object from 8,000 feet per second to8,001 feet per second.The problem is that Newtonian physics is wrong. It takes much more force toincrease by one foot per second the velocity of an object moving at 8,000 feetper second than it takes to increase by one foot per second the velocity of thesame object moving at 100 feet per second.That is because a faster-moving object has more kinetic energy (energy ofmotion). This additional energy makes it behave exactly as if it had more mass.A given amount of force applied for a given amount of time will accelerate aforce applied for the same amount of time to an entire train. Of course, this isbecause an entire train has more mass than a single car.When particles travel at velocities that are fast relative to the speed oflight, their high kinetic energy makes them behave as though they have more massthan they have at lower velocities. In fact, the special theory of relativityshows that the effective mass of a moving object does increase with velocity.Since most subatomic particles travel at different velocities, each one of themcan have many different relative masses. Therefore, physicists have calculatedthe “rest mass” of each particle. The rest mass of a subatomic particle is itsmass when it is not moving. Subatomic particles are never really at rest, butthese calculations provide a uniform method of comparing their masses. This isnecessary since, as the velocity of a particle approaches the speed of light,its relative mass depends upon how fast it is moving. Einstein’s discovery that moving clocks change their rhythm led to somespectacular revisions in the way that we see the world. It showed that there isno “universal” time that permeates the universe. There are only proper timesassociated with various observers. The proper time of each observer isdifferent, unless two of them happen to be at rest relative to each other. Ifthe universe has a heart beat, its rate depends upon the hearer.The special theory of relativity shows that two events which happen at the sametime in one frame of reference may occur at different times when seen fromanother frame of reference. To illustrate this point, Einstein used one of hisfamous thought experiments.A thought experiment is a mental exercise. It has the advantage of requiring noapparatus other than the mind, which frees it from the practical limitations oflaboratory experiments. Most physicists accept the use of thought experiments asa valid theoretical tool, provided they are satisfied that if the experimentcould be performed, the results of the actual experiment would be the same asthose of the thought experiment.Suppose that we are in a moving room. The room is moving with a uniformvelocity. Exactly in the center of the room is a light bulb which flashesperiodically. The room is made of glass so that an outside observer can see whathappens inside.At the precise moment that we pass an outside observer, the light flashes. Thequestion is, is there any difference between what we see inside the moving roomand what the outsider observer sees? According to the special theory ofrelativity, the answer is an extraordinary, concept-shattering Yes. There is abig difference.Inside the room, we see the bulb flash and we see the light spread out in alldirections at the same speed. Since the walls of the room are equidistant fromthe bulb, we see the light strike the forward wall and rearward wall of the roomsimultaneously.The outside observer also sees the flash, and he also sees the light propagatein all directions at the same speed. However, in addition, he sees that the roomis moving. From his point of view the forward wall tries to escape theapproaching light while the rearward wall rushes to meet it. Therefore, to theoutside observer, the light reaches the rearward wall before it reaches theforward wall. If the speed of the room is small compared to the speed of light,the light reaches the rearward wall only slightly ahead of the forward wall.Nonetheless, the light reaches the rearward and forward walls in a one-twoorder, and not at the same time.Although both of us observed the same two events, the light striking the forwardwall and the light striking the rearward wall, we each have different stories totell. To us, inside the room, the two events were simultaneous. To the outsideobserver, one event came first and the other event came later.Einstein’s revolutionary insight was that events which are simultaneous for oneobserver may occur at different times for another observer depending upon theirrelative motion. Put another way, two events, one of which occurs before theother as seen from the frame of reference of one observer, may occur at the sametime when seen from the frame of reference of another observer. One observeruses the words “sooner” and “later.” The other observer uses the word“simultaneous,” even though both of them are describing the same two events.In other words, “sooner,” “later,” and “simultaneous” are local terms. They haveno meaning in the universe at large unless they are tied down to a specificframe of reference. What is “sooner” in one frame of reference may be “later” inanother frame of reference and “simultaneous” in a third.*[footnote48.html#fn48]The mathematics which translate what an observer in one frame of reference seesinto what an observer in another frame of reference sees are the Lorentztransformations. Einstein adopted the Lorentz transformations—which are a set ofequations—virtually intact.No one before Einstein got these startling results from this simple type ofthought experiment because no one before Einstein had the audacity to postulatesomething as outrageous as the principle of the constancy of the velocity oflight. No one had the audacity to postulate something as outrageous as theprinciple of the constancy of the velocity of light because the principle of theconstancy of the velocity of light completely and unequivocally contradictscommon sense; specifically, common sense as represented by the classicaltransformation laws. The classical transformation laws are so embedded in oureveryday experience that it simply never occurred to anybody to question them.Even when the Michelson-Morley experiment produced results that wereincompatible with the classical transformation laws, no beginner’s mind butEinstein’s conceived that the classical transformation laws might be wrong. OnlyEinstein suspected that at very high velocities, velocities far faster thanthose that we encounter through our senses, the classical transformation laws donot apply. This is not to say that they are incorrect. At low velocities(compared to 186,000 miles per second) contraction and time dilation are notdetectable sensorily. In this limited situation, the classical transformationsare a good guide for practical experience. After all, we do reach the top of anescalator faster if we walk.If we do the moving-room experiment with sound instead of light, we do not getthe special theory of relativity. We get a confirmation of the classicaltransformation laws. There is no principle of the constancy of the velocity ofsound because the velocity of sound is not constant. It varies depending uponthe motion of the observer (hearer) as dictated by common sense. The importantword here is “dictated.”We live out our lives in a limited situation of low velocities where the speedof sound (about 700 miles per hour) seems “fast.” Therefore, our common sense isbased upon our experiences in this limited environment. If we want to expand ourunderstanding beyond the limitations of this environment, it is necessary todrastically rearrange our conceptual constructs. This is what Einstein did. Hewas the first person to see that this is what had to be done in order to makesense of such impossible experimental findings as the constancy of the velocityof light for each and every person who measures it, regardless of their statesof motion.This led him to turn the puzzle of the constancy of the velocity of light intothe principle of the constancy of the velocity of light. In turn, that led himto the conclusion that, if the velocity of light really is constant for allobservers, then the measuring instruments used by different observers indifferent states of motion somehow must vary so that all of them give the sameresult. By a stroke of luck, Einstein discovered that these same variances wereexpressed in the equations of the Dutch physicist Hendrik Lorentz, and so heborrowed them. Lastly, the fact that moving clocks change their rhythm ledEinstein to the inescapable conclusion that “now,” “sooner,” “later,” and“simultaneous” are relative terms. They all depend upon the state of motion ofthe observer.This conclusion is precisely the opposite of the assumption upon which Newtonianphysics is based. Newton assumed, as did we all, that there is one clock tickingoff the seconds by which the entire universe grows older. For every second oftime that passes in this corner of the universe, one second of time passes alsoin every other corner of the universe.According to Einstein, this is incorrect. How can anyone say when it is “now”throughout the universe? If we try to designate “now” by the occurrence of twosimultaneous events (like my arrival at the doctor’s office and my watchindicating 3 o’clock), we find that an observer in another frame of referencesees one of our events happening before the other. Absolute time, wrote Newton,“flows equably…,”7 but he was wrong. There is no single time which flows equallyfor all observers. There is no absolute time.The existence of one ultimate flow of time throughout the physical universe,which we all tacitly acknowledged, turned out to be another piece of clothingthat the Emperor wasn’t wearing. Newton made one more mistake in this regard. He said that time and space wereseparate. According to Einstein, time and space are not separate. Somethingcannot exist at some place without existing at some time, and neither can itexist at some time without existing at some place.Most of us think of space and time as separate because that is the way that wethink that we experience them. For example, we seem to have some control overour position in space, but none at all over our position in time. There isnothing that we can do about the flow of time. We can choose to stand perfectlystill, in which case our position in space does not change, but there is no waythat we can stand still in time.This notwithstanding, there is something very elusive about “space” andespecially about “time”; something that prevents us from “resting our accountswith them prematurely.” Subjectively, time has a fluid quality which muchresembles a running brook; sometimes bubbling past in a furious rush, sometimesslipping by quietly unnoticed, and sometimes lying languid, almost stationary,in deep pools. Space, too, has an ubiquitous quality about it which belies thecommon notion that it serves only to separate things.William Blake’s famous poem reaches out toward these intangible qualities:To see a World in a Grain of SandAnd a Heaven in a Wild Flower,Hold Infinity in the palm of your handAnd Eternity in an hour.(Its title, by no coincidence is “Auguries of Innocence.”)The special theory of relativity is a physical theory. Its concern is with themathematically calculable nature of reality. It is not a theory of subjectivity.Although it shows that the appearances of physical reality may vary from oneframe of reference to another, it is a theory about the unchanging (physicistssay “invariant”) aspect of physical reality. Nonetheless, the special theory ofrelativity was the first mathematically rigorous physical theory to exploreareas whose expression previously had been the domain of poets. Like any conciseand poignant re-presentation of reality, the theories of relativity are poetryto mathematicians and physicists. However, Albert Einstein’s enormous publicrenown perhaps was due in part to a shared intuition that he had somethingprofoundly relevant to say about space and time.What Einstein had to say about space and time is that there is no such thing asspace and time; there is only space-time. Space-time is a continuum. A continuumis something whose parts are so close together, so “arbitrarily small,” that thecontinuum really cannot be broken down into them. There are no breaks in acontinuum. It is called a continuum because it flows continuously.For example, a one-dimensional continuum is a line drawn on a wall.Theoretically we might say that the line is comprised of a series of points, butthe points are each infinitely close to one another. The result is that the lineflows continuously from one end of it to the other.An example of a two-dimensional continuum is the wall. It has two dimensions,length and width. Similarly, all of the points on the wall are in contact withother points on the wall, and the wall itself is a continuous surface.A three-dimensional continuum is what we commonly call “space.” A pilot flyinghis airplane navigates in a three-dimensional continuum. To give his location hemust state, for example, not only how far north and how far east of a givenpoint he is, but he also must report his altitude. The airplane itself, like allthings physical, is three-dimensional. It has a width, a height, and a depth.This is why mathematicians call our reality (their reality, too)three-dimensional.According to Newtonian physics, our three-dimensional reality is separate from,and moves forward in, a one-dimensional time. Not so, says the special theory ofrelativity. Our reality is four-dimensional, and the fourth dimension is time.We live, breathe, and exist in a four-dimensional space-time continuum.The Newtonian view of space and time is a dynamic picture. Events develop withthe passage of time. Time is one-dimensional and moves (forward). The past,present, and future happen in that order. The special theory of relativity,however, says that it is preferable, and more useful, to think in terms of astatic, nonmoving picture of space and time. This is the space-time continuum.In this static picture, the space-time continuum, events do not develop, theyjust are. If we could view our reality in a four-dimensional way, we would seethat everything that now seems to unfold before us with the passing of time,already exists in toto, painted, as it were, on the fabric of space-time. Wewould see all, the past, the present, and the future with one glance. Of course,this is only a mathematical proposition (isn’t it?).Don’t worry about visualizing a four-dimensional world. Physicists can’t do it,either. For the moment, just assume that Einstein might be right since theevidence so far suggests that he is. His message is that space and time arerelated in an intimate manner. For lack of a better way of saying it, heexpressed this relationship by calling time a fourth dimension.“Fourth dimension” is a translation from one language to another. The originallanguage is mathematics and the second language is English. The problem is thatthere is simply no way of precisely expressing what the first language says interms of the second language. Therefore, “time as a fourth dimension” is merelya label that we give to a relationship. The relationship in question is therelationship between space and time as it is expressed mathematically in thetheories of relativity.The relationship between space and time that Einstein discovered is similar tothe relationship between the sides of a right triangle which Pythagoras theGreek (a contemporary of Confucius) discovered about 550 B.C.A right triangle is a triangle that contains a right angle. A right angle isformed whenever two perpendicular lines intersect. Below is a right triangle.The side of a right triangle that is opposite the right angle is called thehypotenuse image [Images/169a.jpg]. The hypotenuse is always the longest side ofa right triangle.Pythagoras discovered that as long as we know the length of the two shortersides of a right triangle, we can calculate the length of the longest side. Thisrelationship, expressed mathematically, is the Pythagorean theorem: The firstleg squared plus the second leg squared equals the hypotenuse squared.A hypotenuse of a given length can be calculated from many differentcombinations of shorter legs. In other words, there are many combinations ofdifferent-size legs that all calculate to have the same hypotenuse.image [Images/169b.jpg]For example, the first leg might be very short and the second leg very long.image [Images/170a.jpg]or the other way round,image [Images/170b.jpg]or anything in between.image [Images/171.jpg]If we substitute “space” for one of the legs of a right triangle, “time” for theother leg, and “space-time interval” for the hypotenuse, we have a relationshipwhich is conceptually analogous to the relationship between space, time, and thespace-time interval described in the special theory of relativity.*[footnote49.html#fn49] The space-time interval between two events is anabsolute. It never varies. It can appear differently to observers in differentstates of motion, but it is, itself, invariant. The special theory of relativityshows how observers in different frames of reference can observe the same twoevents and calculate the space-time interval between them. The answer that allof the observers get will be the same.One observer may be in a state of motion such that for him there is a time and adistance involved between the two events, and another observer may be in a stateof motion such that his measuring devices indicate a different distance and adifferent time between the events, but the space-time interval between the twoevents does not vary. For example, the space-time interval, the absoluteseparation, between two exploding stars is the same whether it is viewed from aslow-moving frame of reference, like a planet, or from a fast-moving frame ofreference, like a speeding rocket.* [footnote50.html#fn50]image [Images/172.jpg]Let us return to our experiment with the moving glass room. Although we insidethe room saw the light strike the rearward and forward walls simultaneously, theoutside observer saw the light strike the rearward wall before it reached theforward wall. Nevertheless, by using a Pythagorean-like equation, into which weand the outside observer feed our time and distance measurements, we both getthe same space-time interval between the events.Actually, this Pythagorean-like relationship was the discovery of Einstein’smathematics teacher, Hermann Minkowski, who was inspired by his most famousstudent’s special theory of relativity. In 1908 Minkowski announced his visionthis way:Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away intomere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independentreality.8Minkowski’s mathematical explorations of space and time were both revolutionaryand fascinating. Out of them came a simple diagram of space-time showing themathematical relationship of the past, present, and the future. Of the wealth ofinformation contained in this diagram, the most striking is that all of the pastand all of the future, for each individual, meet and forever meet, at one singlepoint, now. Furthermore, the now of each individual is specifically located andwill never be found in any other place than here (wherever the observer is at).Sixty-three years before Ram Dass’s great book, Be Here Now, established thewatchwords of the awareness movement, Hermann Minkowski proved that, in physicalreality, no choice exists in the matter (pun?). Unfortunately for physicists,the realization is not always the experience. Nonetheless, after two thousandyears of use in the East, being here now, the beginning step in meditation,received the validation of western science via Minkowski’s rigorous mathematicalconfirmation of it, inspired by the special theory of relativity. The last and the most famous aspect of the special theory of relativity is therevelation that mass is a form of energy, and that energy has mass. InEinstein’s words, “Energy has mass and mass represents energy.”9Although this sounds shocking in one sense, in the sense that we have believedever so long that matter, stuff, is different from energy just as the body isdifferent from the mind (another form of the same theory), in another sense, itsounds surprisingly natural. The matter-energy dichotomy goes back at least asfar as the Old Testament. Genesis portrays man as a sort of ceramic creation.God scoops up a handful of clay (matter) and breathes life (energy) into it. TheOld Testament is a product of the western world (or the other way round).Physics also is a product of the western world.In the East, however, there never has been much philosophical or religious (onlyin the West are these two separate) confusion about matter and energy. The worldof matter is a relative world, and an illusory one: illusory not in the sensethat it does not exist, but illusory in the sense that we do not see it as itreally is. The way it really is cannot be communicated verbally, but in theattempt to talk around it, eastern literature speaks repeatedly of dancingenergy and transient, impermanent forms. This is strikingly similar to thepicture of physical reality emerging from high-energy particle physics. Buddhistliterature does not speak of learning new things about reality, but aboutremoving veils of ignorance that stand between us and what we already are.Perhaps this accounts for the fact that the preposterous claim that mass is onlya form of energy is unexpectedly palatable.The formula which expresses the relationship of mass to energy is the mostfamous formula in the world: E = mc2. The energy contained in a piece of matteris equal to the mass of the matter multiplied by an extraordinarily largenumber, the speed of light squared. This means that even the tiniest, the verytiniest particle of matter has within it a tremendous amount of concentratedenergy.Although Einstein didn’t know it at the time, he discovered the secret ofstellar energy. Stars continuously convert matter into energy. It is because ofthe very large ratio of energy released to matter consumed that stars cancontinue to burn through countless millennia.At the center of a star, hydrogen atoms, the primordial “stuff” of the physicalworld, are squeezed together so tightly by the enormous gravitational force ofthe star’s dense mass that they fuse together, making a new element, helium.Every four hydrogen atoms become one helium atom. However, the mass of onehelium atom is not the same as the mass of four hydrogen atoms. It is slightlyless. This small difference in mass is released as radiant energy—heat andlight. The process of fusing lighter elements into heavier elements is called,of course, fusion. The fusion of hydrogen into helium causes a hydrogenexplosion. In other words, a (young) burning star literally is one huge,continuously exploding hydrogen bomb.* [footnote51.html#fn51]The formula E = mc2 also resulted in the atomic bomb. Atomic bombs and atomicreactors obtain energy from mass by the process of fission, which is theopposite of fusion. Instead of fusing smaller atoms into larger ones, theprocess of fission splits atoms of uranium, which are quite large, into atomswhich are smaller.This is done by firing a subatomic particle, a neutron, at an atom of uranium.When the neutron hits the uranium atom, it splits it into lighter atoms, but themass of these smaller atoms together is less than the mass of the parent atom ofuranium. The difference in mass explodes into energy. This process also producesadditional neutrons which fly off to strike other uranium atoms, creating morefissions, more light atoms, more energy, and more neutrons. The whole phenomenonis called a chain reaction. An atomic bomb is an uncontrolled chain reaction.A hydrogen (fusion) bomb is produced by detonating an atomic (fission) bomb inthe midst of hydrogen. The heat from the atomic explosion (in place of the heatof friction caused by gravity) fuses hydrogen atoms into helium atoms andreleases heat in the process which fuses together more hydrogen atoms, releasingmore heat, and so on. There is no limit to the size of a potential hydrogenbomb, and it is constructed from the most plentiful element in the universe.For better or worse, a major revelation of the special theory of relativity isthat mass and energy are different forms of the same thing. Like space and time,they are not separate entities. There is no qualitative difference between massand energy; there is only mass-energy. Mathematically, this discovery meant thatthe two conservation laws of mass and energy could be replaced by a singleconservation law of mass-energy.A conservation law is a simple statement that a quantity of something, whateverit may be, never changes no matter what happens. For example, suppose that therewere a conservation law governing the number of guests at a party. If such athing were true, we would notice that every time a new guest arrived at theparty, some other guest would leave. Similarly, every time a guest at the partyleft, another one would arrive. The rate of guest turnover at the party might begreat or small, and the guests might arrive and depart singly or in groups, butin all circumstances the number of guests at the party would remain the same.The conservation law concerning energy says that the total amount of energy inthe universe always has been and always will be the same. We can convert energyfrom one form to another (like mechanical energy to thermal energy viafriction), but the total amount of energy in the universe does not change.Similarly, the law of the conservation of matter says that the total amount ofmatter in the universe always has been and always will be the same. We canconvert matter from one form to another (like ice to water or water to steam),but the total amount of matter in the universe does not change.When the special theory of relativity combined mass and energy into mass-energy,it also combined the law of the conservation of mass and the law of theconservation of energy into the law of the conservation of mass-energy. The lawof the conservation of mass-energy says that the total amount of mass-energy inthe universe always has been and always will be the same. Mass may be convertedinto energy and energy may be converted into mass, but the total amount ofmass-energy in the universe does not change.The sun, the stars, even wood burning in the fireplace, are examples of massbeing converted into energy. Physicists who study subatomic particles are sofamiliar with the concept of exchanging mass for energy and energy for mass thatthey routinely designate the mass size of particles in terms of their energycontent.In all, there are roughly twelve conservation laws. These simple laws arebecoming more and more important, especially in high-energy particle physics,because they are derived from what physicists now believe to be the ultimateprinciples (latest dance) governing the physical world. These are the laws ofsymmetry.The laws of symmetry are pretty much what they sound like. Something issymmetrical if certain aspects of it remain the same under varying conditions.For example, one half of a circle mirrors the other half, no matter how we cutit. Regardless of how we turn a circle, the right half always mirrors the lefthalf. The position of the circle changes, but its symmetry remains.The Chinese have a similar concept (perhaps the same?). One side of a circle iscalled “yin” and other side is called “yang.” Where there is yin, there is yang.Where there is high, there also is low. Where there is day, there also is night.Where there is death, there also is birth. The concept of yin-yang, which isreally a very old law of symmetry, is yet another way of saying that thephysical universe is a whole which seeks balance within itself. The irony of the special theory of relativity, as apparent by now, is that it isnot about those aspects of reality that are relative, but about those aspectsthat are not relative. Like quantum mechanics, its impact on the assumptions ofNewtonian physics was shattering. Not because it proved them wrong, but becauseit proved them to be quite limited. The special theory of relativity and quantummechanics have propelled us into unimaginably expansive areas of reality, areasabout which we literally had not one previous idea.The assumptions of Newtonian physics correspond to the clothes we always thoughtthat the Emperor was wearing: a universal time whose uniform passage equallyaffects every part of the universe; a separate space, independent though empty;and the belief that there exists somewhere in the universe a place which standsabsolutely still, quiet and unmoving.Every one of these assumptions has been proven untrue (not useful) by thespecial theory of relativity. The Emperor wasn’t wearing them at all. The onlymotion in the physical universe is motion relative to something else. There isno separate space and time. Mass and energy are different names for the samething.In place of these assumptions, the special theory of relativity provides a newand unified physics. Measurements of distance and duration may vary from oneframe of reference to another, but the space-time interval between events neverchanges.For all this, however, the special theory of relativity has one shortcoming. Itis based on a rather uncommon situation. The special theory of relativityapplies only to frames of reference that move uniformly, relative to each other.Most movement, unfortunately, is neither constant nor ideally smooth. In otherwords, the special theory of relativity is built upon an idealization. It islimited to and premised upon the special situation of uniform motion. That iswhy Einstein called it the “special,” or restricted, theory.Einstein’s vision was to construct a physics that is valid for all frames ofreference, such as those moving with non-uniform motion (acceleration anddeceleration) relative to each other, as well as those moving uniformly relativeto each other. His idea was to create a physics which could describe events interms of any frame of reference, no matter how it moves relative to any otherframe of reference.In 1915, Einstein succeeded in achieving the complete generalization of hisspecial theory. He called this achievement the general theory of relativity."},{"pageContent":"1GENERAL NONSENSE [dancingwulimastersthe_con01.html#ch_08]The general theory of relativity shows us that our minds follow different rulesthan the real world does. A rational mind, based on the impressions that itreceives from its limited perspective, forms structures which thereafterdetermine what it further will and will not accept freely. From that point on,regardless of how the real world actually operates, this rational mind,following its self-imposed rules, tries to superimpose on the real world its ownversion of what must be.This continues until at long last a beginner’s mind cries out, “This is notright. What ‘must be’ is not happening. I have tried and tried to discover whythis is so. I have stretched my imagination to the limit to preserve my beliefin what ‘must be.’ The breaking point has come. Now I have no choice but toadmit that the ‘must’ I have believed in does not come from the real world, butfrom my own head.”This narrative is not poetic hyperbole. It is a concise description of the majorconclusion of the general theory of relativity and the means by which it wasreached. The limited perspective is the perspective of our three-dimensionalrationality and its view of one small part of the universe (the part into whichwe were born). The things that “must be” are the ideas of geometry (the rulesgoverning straight lines, circles, triangles, etc.). The beginner’s mind wasAlbert Einstein’s. The long-held belief was that these rules govern, withoutexception, the entirety of the universe. What Einstein’s beginner’s mindrealized was that this is so only in our minds.* [footnote52.html#fn52]Einstein discovered that certain laws of geometry are valid only in limitedregions of space. This makes them useful since our experience physically islimited to very small regions of space, like our solar system. However, as ourexperience expands, we encounter more and more difficulty in trying tosuperimpose these rules upon the entire expanse of the universe.Einstein was the first person to see that the geometrical rules which apply toone small part of the universe as seen from a limited perspective (like ours)are not universal. This freed him to behold the universe in a way that no personhad seen it before.What he saw is the content of the general theory of relativity. Einstein did not set out to prove anything about the nature of our minds. Hisinterest was in physics. “Our new idea,” he wrote, “is simple: to build aphysics valid for all co-ordinate systems.”1 The fact that he did illustratesomething of importance about the way that we structure our perceptions isindicative of an inevitable trend toward the merger of physics and psychology.How did Einstein get from a theory of physics to a revolutionary statement ofgeometry? How did that lead to a significant insight into our mental processes?The answer to these questions is one of the least known, but one of the mostimportant and intriguing intellectual adventures recorded.Einstein started with his special theory of relativity. As successful as it was,Einstein was not satisfied with it because it applied only to co-ordinatesystems moving uniformly relative to each other. Is it possible, thoughtEinstein, to explain the same phenomenon as seen from two different frames ofreference, one of them moving uniformly and the other of them movingnon-uniformly, in such a way that there is a consistent explanation for thephenomenon in terms of both the uniformly moving frame of reference and thenon-uniformly moving frame of reference. In other words, can we describe eventswhich happen in a co-ordinate system which is moving non-uniformly in termswhich are meaningful to an observer in a co-ordinate system which is movinguniformly, and the other way round? Can we create one physics that is valid forobservers in both frames of reference?Yes, discovered Einstein, it is possible for observers in the two differentframes of reference to relate in a manner which is both meaningful in terms oftheir own state of motion and in terms of the other’s state of motion. Toillustrate this, he used another famous thought experiment.Imagine an elevator in an extraordinarily tall building. The cable whichsupports the elevator has snapped, and the elevator is plummeting downward.Inside the elevator are several physicists. They are not aware that the cablehas broken, and, since there are no windows, they cannot look outside.The question is, what is the appraisal of this situation by the observers on theoutside of the elevator (us) and by the observers on the inside of the elevator(the physicists)? Since this is an idealized experiment, we can disregard theeffects of friction and the resistance of the air.To us, the situation is apparent. The elevator is falling and soon it willstrike the earth and all of its inhabitants will be dead. As the elevator falls,it accelerates according to Newton’s law of gravity. The motion of the elevatoris not uniform, but accelerated, because of the gravitational field of theearth.We can predict many things that might happen inside the elevator. For example,if someone inside the elevator dropped a handkerchief, nothing would happen. Itwould appear to the inside observers to float where it was released because itwould be accelerating toward the earth at the same rate as the elevator and thepeople inside of it. Nothing really would be floating, everything would befalling, but, since everything would be falling at the same rate, there would beno change in their relative positions.To a generation of physicists born and brought up inside the elevator, however,things would appear quite differently. To them, dropped objects do not fall,they simply hang in midair. If someone gives a floating object a shove, off itgoes in a straight line until it hits the side of the elevator. To the observersinside the elevator, there are no forces acting on any objects inside theelevator. In short, the observers inside the elevator would conclude that theyare in an inertial co-ordinate system! The laws of mechanics are perfectlyvalid. Their experiments always produce results which agree exactly withtheoretical predictions. An object at rest remains at rest. An object in motionremains in motion. Moving objects are deflected from their paths only by forceswhich are proportional to the amount of deflection. For every reaction there isan equal and opposite reaction. If we give a shove to a floating chair, it goesoff in one direction, and we go off in the opposite direction with an equalmomentum (although with a slower speed because of our greater mass).The inside observers have a consistent explanation for the phenomena inside theelevator: They are in an inertial co-ordinate system, and they can prove it bythe laws of mechanics.The outside observers also have a consistent explanation for the phenomenainside the elevator: The elevator is falling in a gravitational field. Itspassengers are unaware of this because, without being able to see outside theelevator, there is no way for them to detect it while they are falling. Theirco-ordinate system is in accelerated motion, even though they believe that it isnot moving at all.The bridge between these two explanations is gravity. The falling elevator is a pocket edition of an inertial co-ordinate system. Areal inertial co-ordinate system is not limited in space or time. The elevatoredition is limited in both. It is limited in space because a moving objectinside the elevator will not move in a straight line forever, but only until itreaches one of the walls of the elevator. It is limited in time because sooneror later the elevator and its passengers are going to collide with the earth,ending their existence abruptly.According to the special theory of relativity, moreover, it is significant thatthe elevator is limited in size because otherwise it would not appear to itsinhabitants as an inertial co-ordinate system. For example, if the physicistsinside the elevator simultaneously drop two baseballs, the baseballs float inthe air exactly where they are released, and remain there. This, to the outsideobserver, is because they are falling parallel to each other. However, if theelevator were the size of Texas and the baseballs were as far apart when theywere dropped as Texas is wide, the baseballs would not fall parallel to eachother. They would converge, since each of them would be drawn by gravity to thecenter of the earth. The observers inside the elevator would notice that thebaseballs, and any other floating objects in the elevator, move toward eachother with the passage of time, as though there were a mutual attraction betweenthem. This mutual attraction would appear as a “force” affecting the objects inthe elevator, and the physicists inside hardly would conclude, under thosecircumstances, that they were in an inertial co-ordinate system.In short, if it is small enough, a co-ordinate system falling in a gravitationalfield is the equivalent of an inertial co-ordinate system. This is Einstein’sprinciple of equivalence. It is a telling piece of mental dexterity. Anythinglike an “inertial co-ordinate system” that can be “wiped out”2 (Einstein’swords) by the assumption of a gravitational field hardly deserves to be calledabsolute (as in “absolute motion,” and “absolute nonmotion”). While theobservers inside the elevator experience a lack of motion and the absence ofgravity, the observers outside the elevator see a co-ordinate system (theelevator) accelerating through a gravitational field.Now let us imagine a variation of this situation.Assume that we, the outside observers, are in an inertial co-ordinate system. Wealready know what happens in inertial co-ordinate systems; the same things thathappened in the falling elevator. There are no forces, including gravity, toaffect us. Therefore, let us assume that we are comfortably floating. Objects atrest remain at rest, objects in motion continue in a straight line forever, andevery action produces an equal and opposite reaction.In our inertial co-ordinate system is an elevator. Someone has attached a ropeto the elevator and is pulling it in the direction indicated.image [Images/184.jpg]Since this is a thought experiment, it does not matter how this is done. Theelevator is being pulled with a constant force, which means that it is in astate of constant acceleration in the direction of the arrow. How will observersoutside the elevator and observers inside the elevator appraise this situation?As we float outside the elevator, we experience that our frame of reference isabsolutely at rest and that there is no gravity affecting it. We see theelevator being pulled with a constant acceleration by the rope, and so we canpredict certain things about it. Everything inside the elevator that is notattached quickly collides with the floor of the elevator. If someone in theelevator drops a handkerchief, the elevator floor rushes up to meet it. Ifsomeone in the elevator tries to jump off the floor, the floor, rushing upward,is instantly under his feet again. The floor of the elevator continually crashesinto anything in its path as it accelerates upward.Inside the elevator, however, the appraisal of the situation is quite different.To a generation of physicists born and brought up inside the elevator, talk ofacceleration upward is fantasy (remember, the elevator has no windows). To them,their co-ordinate system is quite at rest. Objects fall downward to the floorbecause of a gravitational field, just as objects on the earth fall downward tothe floor because of a gravitational field.Both the observers inside the elevator and the observers outside the elevatorhave consistent explanations for the phenomena inside the elevator. We observersoutside the elevator explain them by the accelerated motion of the elevator. Theobservers inside the elevator explain them by the presence of a gravitationalfield. There is absolutely no way to determine which of us is right.“Wait a minute,” we say, “suppose that we cut a small hole in one wall of theelevator and shine a light beam through it. If the elevator really weremotionless, the light beam would strike the opposite wall of the elevator at aspot exactly opposite the hole. Since we can see that the elevator isaccelerating upward, we know that the elevator wall will move upward slightly inthe time it takes the light beam to cross the elevator. Therefore, the lightbeam will strike the far wall slightly below the spot just opposite the hole itentered through. In effect, it will seem to curve downward from the point ofview of the people inside the elevator instead of traveling in a straight line.This should prove to them that their elevator is in motion.”“It does not prove anything of the sort,” says Jim de Wit, who, of course, isinside the elevator. “The light beams in this elevator do not travel in straightlines. How could they? We are in a gravitational field. Light is energy, andenergy has mass. Gravity attracts mass, and a light beam traveling through ourelevator will be drawn downward by our gravitational field exactly like abaseball thrown horizontally at the speed of light.”There is no way that we can convince de Wit that his co-ordinate system is in astate of accelerated motion. Everything that we can say to prove this to him hedismisses (accounts for) as a result of his “gravitational field.” There isabsolutely no way of distinguishing between uniform accelerated motion and aconstant gravitational field.This is another expression of Einstein’s principle of equivalence. In limitedareas, gravity is equivalent to acceleration. We already saw that acceleration(falling) through a “gravitational field” is the equivalent of an inertialco-ordinate system. Now we see that a “gravitational field” is equivalent toaccelerated motion. At last we are approaching a general theory of relativity, atheory valid for all frames of reference regardless of their states of motion.The bridge which links the explanations of the observers inside of the elevatorand the explanations of the observers outside of the elevator is gravity. Theclue which indicated to Einstein that gravity was the key to his general theorywas as old as physics itself. There are two kinds of mass, which means that there are two ways of talkingabout it. The first is gravitational mass. The gravitational mass of an object,roughly speaking, is the weight of the object as measured on a balance scale.Something that weighs three times more than another object has three times moremass. Gravitational mass is the measure of how much force the gravity of theearth exerts on an object. Newton’s laws describe the effects of this force,which vary with the distance of the mass from the earth. Although Newton’s lawsdescribe the effects of this force, they do not define it. This is the mysteryof action-at-a-distance. How does the earth invisibly reach up and pull objectsdownward?The second type of mass is inertial mass. Inertial mass is the measure of theresistance of an object to acceleration (or deceleration, which is negativeacceleration). For example, it takes three times more force to move threerailroad cars from a standstill to twenty miles per hour (positive acceleration)than it takes to move one railroad car from a standstill to twenty miles perhour. Similarly, once they are moving, it takes three times more force to stopthree cars than it takes to stop the single car. This is because the inertialmass of the three railroad cars is three times more than the inertial mass ofthe single railroad car.Inertial mass and gravitational mass are equal. This explains why a feather anda cannonball fall with equal velocity in a vacuum. The cannonball has hundredsof times more gravitational mass than the feather (it weighs more) but it alsohas hundreds of times more resistance to motion than the feather (its inertialmass). Its attraction to the earth is hundreds of times stronger than that ofthe feather, but then so is its inclination not to move. The result is that itaccelerates downward at the same rate as the feather, although it seems that itshould fall much faster.The fact that inertial mass and gravitational mass are equal was known threehundred years ago, but physicists considered it a coincidence. No significancewas attached to it until Einstein published his general theory of relativity.The “coincidence” of the equivalence of gravitational mass and inertial mass wasthe “clew,”3 to use Einstein’s word, that led him to the principle ofequivalence, which refers via the equivalence of gravitational mass and inertialmass to the equivalence of gravity and acceleration themselves. These are thethings that he illustrated with his famous elevator examples.The special theory of relativity deals with unaccelerated (uniform) motion.*[footnote53.html#fn53] If acceleration is neglected, the special theory ofrelativity applies. However, since gravity and acceleration are equivalent, thisis the same as saying that the special theory of relativity is applicablewhenever gravity is neglected. If the effects of gravity are to be considered,then we must use the general theory of relativity. In the physical world theeffects of gravity can be neglected in (1) remote regions of space which are farfrom any centers of gravity (matter), and (2) in very small regions of space.Why gravity can be ignored in very small regions of space leads to the mostpsychedelic aspect of all Einstein’s theories. Gravity can be ignored in verysmall regions of space because, if the region is small enough, the mountainousterrain of space-time is not noticeable.* [footnote54.html#fn54] The nature of the space-time continuum is like that of a hilly countryside. Thehills are caused by pieces of matter (objects). The larger the piece of matter,the more it curves the space-time continuum. In remote regions of space far fromany matter of significant size, the space-time continuum resembles a flat plain.A piece of matter the size of the earth causes quite a bump in the space-timecontinuum, and a piece of matter the size of a star causes a relative mountain.As an object travels through the space-time continuum, it takes the easiest pathbetween two points. The easiest path between two points in the space-timecontinuum is called a geodesic (geo dee’ sic). A geodesic is not always astraight line owing to the nature of the terrain in which the object findsitself.Suppose that we are in a balloon looking down on a mountain that has a brightbeacon on the top of it. The mountain rises gradually out of the plain, andbecomes more and more steep as its elevation increases, until, close to the top,it rises almost straight up. There are many villages surrounding the mountain,and there are footpaths connecting all of the villages with each other. As thepaths approach the mountain, all of them begin to curve in one way or another,to avoid going unnecessarily far up the mountain.Suppose that it is nighttime and that, looking down, we can see neither themountain nor the footpaths. All that we can see is the beacon and the torches ofthe travelers below. As we watch, we notice that the torches deflect from astraight path when they approach the vicinity of the beacon. Some of them curvegently around the beacon in a graceful arc some distance away from it. Othersapproach the beacon more directly, but the closer they get to it, the moresharply they turn away from it.From this, we probably would deduce that some force emanating from the beaconwas repelling all attempts to approach it. For example, we might speculate thatthe beacon is extremely hot and painful to approach.With the coming of daylight, however, we can see that the beacon is situated onthe top of a large mountain and that it has nothing whatever to do with themovement of the torch-bearers. They simply followed the easiest paths availableto them over the terrain between their points of origin and destination.This masterful analogy was created by Bertrand Russell. In this case, themountain is the sun, the travelers are the planets, asteroids, comets (anddebris from the space program), the footpaths are their orbits, and the comingof daylight is the coming of Einstein’s general theory of relativity.The point is that the objects in the solar system move as they do not because ofsome mysterious force (gravity) exerted upon them at a distance by the sun, butbecause of the nature of the neighborhood through which they are traveling.Arthur Eddington illustrated this same situation in another way. Suppose, hesuggested, that we are in a boat looking down into clear water. We can see thesand on the bottom and the fishes swimming beneath us. As we watch, we noticethat the fish seem to be repelled from a certain point. As they approach it,they swim either to the right or to the left of it, but never over it. From thiswe probably would deduce that there is a repellant force at that point whichkeeps the fish away.However, if we should go into the water to get a closer look, we would see thatan enormous sunfish has buried himself in the sand at that point, creating asizable mound. As fish swimming along the bottom approach the mound, they followthe easiest path available to them, which is around it rather than over it.There is no “force” causing the fish to avoid that particular spot. If all hadbeen known from the first, that spot was merely the top of a large mound whichthe fish found easier to swim around than to swim over.The movement of the fish was determined not by a force emanating from themysterious spot, but by the nature of the neighborhood through which they werepassing. (Eddington’s sunfish was called “Albert”) (really). If we could see thegeography (the geometry) of the space-time continuum, we would see that,similarly, it, and not “forces between objects,” is the reason that planets movein the ways that they do. It is not possible for us actually to see the geometry of the space-timecontinuum because it is four-dimensional and our sensory experience is limitedto three dimensions. For that reason, it is not even possible to picture it.For example, suppose that there existed a world of two-dimensional people. Sucha world would look like a picture on a television or a movie screen. The peopleand the objects in a two-dimensional world would have height and width, but notdepth. If these two-dimensional figures had a life and an intelligence of theirown, their world would appear quite different to them than our world appears tous, for they could not experience the third dimension.A straight line drawn between two of these people would appear to them as awall. They would be able to walk around either end of it, but they would not beable to “step over” it, because their physical existence is limited to twodimensions. They cannot step off the screen into the third dimension. They wouldknow what a circle is, but there is no way that they could know what a sphereis. In fact, a sphere would appear to them as a circle.If they like to explore, they soon would discover that their world is flat andinfinite. If two of them went off in opposite directions, they would never meet.They also could create a simple geometry. Sooner or later they would generalizetheir experiences into abstractions to help them do and build the things thatthey want to do and build in their physical world. For example, they woulddiscover that whenever three straight metal bars form a triangle, the angles ofthe triangle always total 180 degrees. Sooner or later, the more perceptiveamong them would substitute mental idealizations (straight lines) for the metalbars. That would allow them to arrive at the abstract conclusion that atriangle, which by definition is formed by three straight lines, always contains180 degrees. To learn more about triangles, they no longer would need actuallyto construct them.The geometry that such a two-dimensional people would create is the samegeometry that we studied in school. It is called Euclidean geometry, in honor ofthe Greek, Euclid, whose thoughts on the subject were so thorough that no oneexpanded on them for nearly two thousand years. (The content of most high-schoolgeometry books is about two millennia old.)Now let us suppose that someone, unbeknownst to them, transported thesetwo-dimensional people from their flat world onto the surface of an enormouslylarge sphere. This means that instead of being perfectly flat, their physicalworld now would be somewhat curved. At first, no one would notice thedifference. However, if their technology improved enough to allow them to beginto travel and to communicate over great distances, these people eventually wouldmake a remarkable discovery. They would discover that their geometry could notbe verified in their physical world.For example, they would discover that if they surveyed a large enough triangleand measured the angles that form it, it would have more than 180 degrees! Thisis a simple phenomenon for us to picture. Imagine a triangle drawn on a globe.The apex (top) of the triangle is at the north pole. The two lines intersectingthere form a right angle. The equator is the base of the triangle. Look whathappens. Both sides of the triangle, upon intersecting the equator, also formright angles. According to Euclidean geometry, a triangle contains only tworight angles (180 degrees), yet this triangle contains three right angles (270degrees).Remember that in our example, the two-dimensional people actually have surveyeda triangle on what they presumed was their flat world, measured the angles, andcome up with 270 degrees. What a confusion. When the dust settles they wouldrealize that there are only two possible explanations.The first possible explanation is that the straight lines used to construct thetriangle (like light beams) were not actually straight, although they seemed tobe straight. This could account for the excessive number of degrees in thetriangle. However, if this is the explanation that they choose to adopt, thenthey must create a “force” responsible for somehow distorting the straight lines(like “gravity”). The second possible explanation is that their abstractgeometry does not apply to their real world. This is another way of saying that,impossible as it sounds, their universe is not Euclidean.The idea that their physical reality is not Euclidean probably would sound sofantastic to them (especially if they had had no reason to question the realityof Euclidean geometry for two thousand years) that they probably would choose tolook for forces responsible for distorting their straight lines.*[footnote55.html#fn55]The problem is that, having chosen this course, they would be obligated tocreate a responsible force every time that their physical world failed tovalidate Euclidean geometry. Eventually the structure of these necessary forceswould become so complex that it would be much simpler to forget them altogetherand admit that their physical world does not follow the logically irrefutablerules of Euclidean geometry.Our situation is parallel to that of the two-dimensional people who cannotperceive, but who can deduce that they are living in a three-dimensional world.We are a three-dimensional people who cannot perceive, but who can deduce thatwe are living in a four-dimensional universe.For two thousand years we have assumed that the entire physical universe, likethe geometry that the ancient Greeks created from their experience with thispart of it, was Euclidean. That the geometry of Euclid is universally validmeans that it can be verified anywhere in the physical world. That assumptionwas wrong. Einstein was the first person to see that the universe is not boundby the rules of Euclidean geometry, even though our minds tenaciously cling tothe idea that it is. Although we cannot perceive the four-dimensional space-time continuum directly,we can deduce from what we already know of the special theory of relativity thatour universe is not Euclidean. Here is another of Einstein’s thoughtexperiments.Imagine two concentric circles, one with a small radius and one with a verylarge radius. Both of them revolve around a common center as shown.image [Images/193.jpg]Imagine also that we, the observers, are watching these revolving circles froman inertial co-ordinate system. Being in an inertial co-ordinate system simplymeans that our frame of reference is at rest relative to everything, includingthe revolving circles. Drawn over the revolving circles are two identicalconcentric circles which are in our co-ordinate system. They are not revolving.They are the same size as the revolving circles and have the same common center,but they remain motionless. While we and our nonrevolving circles aremotionless, we are in communication with an observer who is on the revolvingcircles. He actually is going around with them.According to Euclidean geometry, the ratio of the radius to the circumference ofall circles is the same. If we measure the radius and the circumference of thesmall circle, for example, the ratio of these two measurements will be the sameas the ratio of the radius to the circumference of the large circle. The objectof this thought experiment is to determine whether this is true or not for boththe observers on the stationary circles (us) and the observer on the revolvingcircles. If the geometry of Euclid is valid throughout the physical universe, asit should be, we should discover that the ratio between the radius and thecircumference of all the circles involved is identical.Both we and the observer on the revolving circles will use the same ruler to doour measuring. “The same ruler” means that either we actually hand him the sameruler that we have used, or that we use rulers that have the same length when atrest in the same co-ordinate system.We go first. Using our ruler, we measure the radius of our small circle, andthen we measure the circumference of our small circle. Then we note the ratiobetween them. The next step is to measure the radius of our large circle andthen the circumference of our large circle. Then we note the ratio between them.Yes, it is the same ratio that we found between the radius and the circumferenceof our small circle. We have proved that Euclidean geometry is valid in ourco-ordinate system, which is an inertial co-ordinate system.Now we hand the ruler to the observer on the revolving circles as he passes byus. Using this ruler he first measures the radius of his small circle and findsthat it is the same as ours, since our circles are drawn directly over hiscircles. Next he measures the circumference of his small circle. Remember thatmotion causes rulers to contract in the direction that they are moving. However,since the radius of the small circle is so short, the velocity of the ruler whenit is placed on the circumference of the small circle is not fast enough to makethe effect of relativistic contraction noticeable. Therefore, the observer onthe revolving circles measures the circumference of his small circle and findsit to be the same as the circumference of our small circle. Naturally, the ratiobetween them also is the same. So far so good. The ratios between the radius andthe circumference of three circles have been determined (our small circle, ourlarge circle, and his small circle) and they are all identical. This is exactlywhat should happen according to high-school geometry books across the country.Only one more circle to go.The observer on the revolving circles measures the radius of his large circleand finds it to be the same length as the radius of our large circle. Now hecomes to the last measurement, the circumference of his large circle. However,as soon as he puts his ruler into position to make a measurement on thecircumference of the large revolving circle, his ruler contracts! Because theradius of his large circle is much larger than the radius of his small circle,the velocity of the circumference of the large revolving circle is considerablyfaster than the velocity of the circumference of the small revolving circle.Since the ruler must be aligned in the direction that the circumference ismoving, it becomes shorter. When the revolving observer uses this ruler tomeasure the circumference of the large revolving circle, he finds that it islarger than the circumference of our large circle. This is because his ruler isshorter. (Contraction also affected his ruler when he measured the radius of hislarge circle, but since it then was placed perpendicular to the direction ofmotion, it became skinnier, nor shorter).This means that the ratio of the radius to the circumference of the smallrevolving circle is not the same as the ratio of the radius to the circumferenceof the large revolving circle. According to Euclidean geometry, this is notpossible, but there it is.If we want to be old-fashioned about it (before-Einstein) we can say that thissituation is nothing unusual. By definition, the laws of mechanics and thegeometry of Euclid are valid only in inertial systems (that is what makes theminertial systems). We simply don’t consider co-ordinate systems which are notinertial. (This was really the position of physicists before Albert Einstein.)This is exactly what seemed wrong to Einstein. His idea was to create a physicsvalid for all co-ordinate systems, since the universe abounds with thenon-inertial as well as the inertial kind.If we are to create such a universally valid physics, a general physics, then wemust treat both the observers in the stationary (inertial) system and theobserver on the revolving circles (a non-inertial system) with equalseriousness. The person on the revolving circles has as much right to relate thephysical world to his frame of reference as we have to relate it to ours. True,the laws of mechanics as well as the geometry of Euclid are not valid in hisframe of reference, but every deviation from them can be explained in terms of agravitational field which affects his frame of reference.This is what Einstein’s theory allows us to do. It allows us to express the lawsof physics in such a way that they are independent of specific space-timeco-ordinates. Space and time co-ordinates (measurements) vary from one frame ofreference to another, depending upon the state of motion of the frame ofreference. The general theory of relativity allows us to universalize the lawsof physics and to apply them to all frames of reference. “Wait a minute,” we say, “how can anyone measure distance or navigate in aco-ordinate system like the one on the revolving circles? The length of a rulervaries from place to place in such a system. The farther we go from the center,the faster the velocity of the ruler, and the more it contracts. This doesn’thappen in an inertial co-ordinate system, which, in effect, is a system that isat rest. Because there is no change of velocity throughout an inertialco-ordinate system, rulers do not change length.“This allows us to organize inertial systems like a city, block by block. Sincerulers do not change length in inertial systems, all the blocks that are laidout with the same ruler will be the same length. No matter where we travel, weknow that ten blocks is twice the distance of five blocks.“In a non-inertial system the velocity of the system varies from place to place.This means that the length of a ruler varies from place to place. If we used thesame ruler to lay out all the city blocks in a non-inertial co-ordinate system,some of them would be larger than others depending upon where they werelocated.”“What is wrong with that,” asks Jim de Wit, “as long as we still can determineour position in the co-ordinate system? Imagine a sheet of india rubber on whichwe have drawn a grid so that it looks like a piece of graph paper (firstdrawing, next page). This is a co-ordinate system. Assuming that we are at thelower left corner (we can start anywhere) let us say that a party Saturday nightis being held at the intersection marked ‘Party.’ To get there we have to go twosquares to the right and two squares up.“Now suppose that we stretch the sheet of rubber so that it looks like thesecond drawing.“The same directions (two squares right and two squares up) still bring us tothe party. The only difference is that unless we are familiar with this part ofthe co-ordinate system, we cannot calculate the distance that we have to travelas easily as we could if all of the squares were the same size.”According to the general theory of relativity, gravity, which is the equivalentof acceleration, is what distorts the space-time continuum in a manner analogousto our stretching the sheet of rubber. Where the effects of gravity can beneglected, the space-time continuum is like the sheet of rubber before westretched it. All of the lines are straight lines and all of the clocks aresynchronized. In other words, the undistorted sheet of rubber is analogous tothe space-time continuum of an inertial co-ordinate system and the specialtheory of relativity applies.image [Images/198a.jpg]image [Images/198b.jpg]However, in the universe at large gravity cannot be neglected. Wherever there isa piece of matter, it warps the space-time continuum. The larger the piece ofmatter, the more pronounced the warp.In the example of the revolving circles, the variation of velocity in differentparts of the co-ordinate system caused the ruler to change size. With that inmind, remember that acceleration (change in velocity) is the equivalent ofgravity. Therefore, changes in the strength of a gravitational field willproduce the same contractions of the ruler as changes in velocity.“Acceleration” and “gravity” are two ways of saying the same thing. That meansthat if a ruler is subjected to gravitational fields of different strength, itchanges length.Of course, it is impossible to travel through our solar system, much less ourgalaxy, without encountering gravitational fields of varying intensity, whichwould cause any maps that we somehow could produce to look distorted like thestretched piece of india rubber. The terrain of the space-time continuum inwhich our earth moves is like a hilly countryside with a mountain (the sun)dominating the geography.According to Newton, the earth wants to continue forever in a straight line, butforever is deflected from its inclination by the gravitational force of the sun.A balance of the two keeps the earth in orbit around the sun. According toEinstein, the earth’s orbit is simply the easiest path for the earth to take asit moves through the space-time continuum, warped as it is in this neighborhoodby the sun.Imagine how complex is the geography of the space-time continuum which is ouruniverse with its solar systems, star systems, galaxies, and galaxy clusters,each of them causing major and minor bumps, curves, hills, valleys, andmountains in the four-dimensional space-time continuum.Would it be possible to navigate under such circumstances?Yes. Although it is a crude example, sailors navigate under somewhat analogouscircumstances. We cover the earth with squares which are formed by lines oflatitude and longitude. The size of these squares varies depending upon wherethey are located. The closer they are to the equator, the larger they are. (Ifthis is unclear, look at a globe). Nonetheless, we still can locate physicalpoints on the surface of the earth by designating the intersection of a line oflatitude and a line of longitude. Knowing the number of squares between us andwhere we want to sail does not give us the distance to our destination becausethe squares may vary in size. However, if we know the nature of our terrain (aglobe) we can calculate distances on it (using spherical trigonometry).Similarly, once we know the properties of an area of the space-time continuum(by exploring it) we can determine not only the position of, but also thedistance (interval) between two events in the space-time continuum.*[footnote56.html#fn56] The mathematical structure of the general theory ofrelativity, which Einstein created over a period of ten years, permits us to dojust that.The equations of the general theory of relativity are structural formulas. Theydescribe the structure of changing gravitational fields. (Newton’s formuladescribes a situation between two objects at a given time. Einstein’s formulasrelate a situation here and now to a situation in the immediate vicinity alittle later.) By feeding the results of actual observations into theseequations, they give us a picture of the space-time continuum in theneighborhood of our observations. In other words, they reveal the geometry ofspace-time in that area. Once we know that, our situation is roughly analogousto that of a sailor who knows that the earth is round and also knows sphericaltrigonometry. † [footnote57.html#fn57]We have said, up to now, that matter distorts, or causes a curvature of, thespace-time continuum in its vicinity. According to Einstein’s ultimate vision,which he never “proved” (demonstrated mathematically), a piece of matter is acurvature of the space-time continuum! In other words, according to Einstein’sultimate vision, there are no such things as “gravitational fields” and“masses.” They are only mental creations. No such things exist in the realworld. There is no such thing as “gravity”—gravity is the equivalent ofacceleration, which is motion. There is no such thing as “matter”—matter is acurvature of the space-time continuum. There is not even such a thing as“energy”—energy equals mass and mass is space-time curvature.What we considered to be a planet with its own gravitational field moving aroundthe sun in an orbit created by the gravitational attraction (force) of the sunis actually a pronounced curvature of the space-time continuum finding itseasiest path through the space-time continuum in the vicinity of a verypronounced curvature of the space-time continuum.There is nothing but space-time and motion and they, in effect, are the samething. Here is an exquisite presentation, in completely western terms, of themost fundamental aspect of Taoist and Buddhist philosophies. Physics is the study of physical reality. If a theory does not relate to thephysical world, it may be pure mathematics, poetry, or blank verse, but it isnot physics. The question is, does Einstein’s fantastic theory really work?The answer is a slightly tentative, but generally accepted “Yes.” Mostphysicists agree that the general theory of relativity is a valid way of viewinglarge-scale phenomena, and at the same time, most physicists still are eager tosee more evidence to confirm (or challenge) this position.Since the general theory of relativity deals with vast expanses of the universe,its proof (or usefulness, not of “truth”—the watch is still unopenable) cannotcome from observations of phenomena limited to the earth. For this reason, itsverifications come from astronomy.Thus far, the general theory of relativity has been verified in four ways. Thefirst three ways are straightforward and convincing. The last way, if earlyobservations are correct, may be more fantastic than the theory itself.The first verification of the general theory of relativity came as an unexpectedbenefit to astronomers. Newton’s law of gravity purported to describe the orbitsof the planets around the sun, and it did—all of them except Mercury. Mercuryorbits the sun in such a way that some parts of its orbit bring it closer to thesun than others. The part of Mercury’s orbit closest to the sun is called itsperihelion. The first verification of Einstein’s general theory of relativityturned out to be the long-sought explanation of the problem of Mercury’sperihelion.The problem with Mercury’s perihelion—in fact, with Mercury’s entire orbit—isthat it moves. Instead of continuously retracing its path around the sunrelative to a co-ordinate system attached to the sun, Mercury’s orbit itselfrevolves around the sun. The rate of revolution is extremely slow (it completesone revolution around the sun every three million years). This still was enoughto puzzle astronomers. Prior to Einstein, this precession in Mercury’s orbit hadbeen attributed to an undiscovered planet in our solar system. By the timeEinstein published his general theory of relativity, the search for thismysterious planet was well underway.Einstein created his general theory of relativity without special attention tothe perihelion of Mercury. However, when the general theory of relativity wasapplied to this problem, it showed that Mercury moves precisely as Mercury hasto move through the space-time continuum in that vicinity of the sun! The otherplanets do not move significantly in this way because they are farther away fromthe sun’s gravity. Score one for the general theory.image [Images/202.jpg]The second verification of the general theory of relativity was the fulfillmentof a prediction specifically made by Einstein. Einstein predicted that lightbeams are bent by gravitational fields. He also predicted exactly how much theyare bent, and he suggested an experiment to test this prediction. Einsteinsuggested that astronomers measure the deflection of starlight by thegravitational field of the sun.According to Einstein, the presence of the sun between a group of visible starsand the earth will cause an apparent change in the position of the stars becauselight coming from them will be bent by the gravitational field of the sun. Inorder to perform this experiment, it is necessary to photograph a group of starsat night, noting their positions relative to each other and other stars in theirperiphery, and then to photograph the same group during the day when the sun isbetween them and us. Of course, stars only can be photographed in the daytimeduring a total eclipse of the sun by the moon.Astronomers consulted their star charts and discovered that May 29 is the idealday for such an undertaking. This is because the sun, in its apparent journeyacross a varied stellar background, is in front of an exceptionally richgrouping of bright stars on that date. By incredible coincidence, a totaleclipse of the sun occurred on May 29, 1919, only four years after the generaltheory was published. Preparations were made to use this event to testEinstein’s new theory.Light signals from a star are bent in the neighborhood of the sun. Because weassume that starlight travels in a straight line, we assume that the star is ina position other than it actually is.image [Images/203.jpg]Although light was supposed to travel in a straight line in a vacuum, a certainamount of bending already was theorized before Einstein’s general theory ofrelativity. Newton’s law of gravity was used to calculate this bending, eventhough it could not explain it. Einstein’s theory predicted roughly twice thedeflection that Newton’s law predicted, and, in addition, it supplied anexplanation for it. Physicists and astronomers alike eagerly awaited the outcomeof this confrontation between the new theory and the old.The 1919 eclipse was photographed by two different expeditions sent to twodifferent parts of the world. These expeditions also took photographs of thesame stellar background at times when the sun was not in the area. The resultsof both expeditions vindicated Einstein’s calculations, not Newton’s. Since1919, the same verdict has been reached again and again during other eclipses.All of them confirm Einstein’s predictions. Score two for the general theory.The third verification of the general theory of relativity is calledgravitational red shift. Remember that gravity (because it is the equivalent ofacceleration) not only causes rulers to contract, but it also causes clocks torun more slowly.A clock is anything that repeats itself periodically. An atom is a type ofclock. It vibrates at a certain frequency. When a substance, like sodium, ismade to glow, the wavelength of the light that it emits can be measuredaccurately. This wavelength tells us exactly the frequency of the vibrations ofthe atoms that comprise the substance. If the frequency should vary, thewavelength also will vary.If we want to compare the rhythm of a clock here on the earth with the rhythm ofa clock that is influenced by an intense gravitational field, like that of thesun, we do not need to send a clock to the surface of the sun. The clocksalready are in place.Einstein predicted that any periodic process that takes place in an atom on thesun, where the gravity is very intense, must take place at a slightly slowerrate than it does here on the earth. To test this prediction, all we need do iscompare the wavelength of the radiation of a given element as it is found insunlight and as it is found here on earth in the laboratory. This has been donemany times. In each case, the wavelength measured from the sunlight was found tobe longer than its laboratory counterpart. A longer wavelength means a lower(slower) frequency. Sodium atoms, for example, vibrate more slowly under theinfluence of the sun’s strong gravitational field than they do on the earth. Sodo all the atoms.This phenomenon is called gravitational redshift because the wavelengthsinvolved appear to be shifted slightly toward the red end of the visible lightspectrum where the wavelengths are the longest. Score three for the generaltheory.Mercury’s moving perihelion, starlight deflection, and gravitational redshiftare all observable phenomena. Now we come to an area where theory is stillpredominant and observation is minimal. Nonetheless, it is an area that is byfar the most exciting and perhaps the most stimulating in the entire history ofscience. The fourth verification of the general theory of relativity appears tobe the phenomenon of the black hole.In 1958, David Finkelstein published a paper in which he theorized, on the basisof Einstein’s general theory of relativity, a phenomenon that he called a“one-way membrane.”4 Finkelstein showed that under certain conditions involvingan extremely dense gravitational field, an invisible threshold can occur intowhich light and physical objects can enter, but from which they never again canescape.* [footnote58.html#fn58]The following year, a young graduate student at the University of London heardFinkelstein, who was speaking there as a guest lecturer, explain his one-waymembrane. The idea caught his attention and then his imagination. The youngstudent was Roger Penrose. Expanding on Finkelstein’s discovery, he developed itinto the modern theory of the “Black Hole.” † [footnote59.html#fn59]A black hole is an area of space which appears absolutely black because thegravitation there is so intense that not even light can escape into thesurrounding areas.* [footnote60.html#fn60] Gravitation is negligible on thelaboratory level, but quite important when bodies of large mass are concerned.Therefore, the exploration of black holes naturally became a joint venture ofphysicists and astronomers.Astronomers speculated that a black hole may be one of several possible productsof stellar evolution. Stars do not burn indefinitely. They evolve through a lifecycle which begins with hydrogen gas and sometimes ends with a very dense,burned-out, rotating mass. The exact end product of this process depends uponthe size of the star undergoing it. According to one theory, stars which areabout three times the size of our sun or larger end up as black holes. Theremains of such stars are unimaginably dense. They may be only a few miles indiameter and yet contain the entire mass of a star three times larger than thesun. Such a dense mass produces a gravitational field strong enough to pulleverything in its vicinity into it, while at the same time allowing nothing, noteven light, to escape from it.Surrounding this remainder of a star is an “event horizon.” An event horizon iscreated by the enormous gravitational field of the burned-out star. It functionsprecisely like Finkelstein’s one-way membrane. Anything within the gravitationalfield of this mass quickly is pulled toward it, and once past the event horizon,never can return. It is the event horizon which constitutes the essentialfeature of the black hole. What happens to an object that passes through anevent horizon is even more fantastic than the wildest (currently) sciencefiction.If the black hole is not rotating, the object will be pulled directly to thecenter of the black hole to a point called the singularity. There it literallywill be squeezed out of existence, or as physicists say, to zero volume. At theblack hole singularity all of the laws of physics break down completely, andeven space and time disappear. It is speculated that everything which is suckedinto a black hole is spilled out again on “the other side”—the “other side”being another universe!If the black hole is rotating, an object that is sucked into the event horizoncould miss the black hole singularity (which is shaped like a “ring” in arotating black hole) and emerge into another time and another place in thisuniverse (through “wormholes”), or into another universe (through“Einstein-Rosen bridges”). In this way, rotating black holes may be the ultimatetime machines.Although black holes are almost invisible, we can search for observablephenomena that may be characteristic of them. The first of these is a largeamount of electromagnetic radiation. A black hole continuously attracts hydrogenatoms, cosmic particles, and everything else to it. As these particles andobjects are drawn to the black hole, they steadily accelerate through itsgravitational field until they approach the velocity of light itself. Thiscauses tremendous amounts of electromagnetic radiation. (Any acceleratingcharged particle creates electromagnetic radiation.)The second observable characteristic of an invisible black hole is its effect ona nearby visible star. If a visible star can be found which moves as though itwere revolving around an invisible star (i.e., as though it were half of abinary star system), we might speculate that it actually is revolving around aninvisible star, and that its invisible partner is a black hole.The search for black holes consequently became the search for these twophenomena. In 1970, the satellite Uhuru located both of them in one area. Itpinpointed a high-energy x-ray source in the constellation Cygnus which emits amillion times more energy than the sun. This high-energy source ofelectromagnetic radiation, which came to be known as Cygnus X-1, is very closeto a visible blue-hot supergiant star. Scientists now believe that this bluesupergiant forms a binary system with the black hole, Cygnus X-1.As the visible star and the invisible black hole orbit each other, the bluesupergiant literally is being sucked into the black hole. As material is tornaway from its surface, it plunges into the black hole at tremendous speed,emitting x-rays. Incredible as Cygnus X-1 is, more than one hundred similarobjects have been detected within our own Milky Way galaxy since its discovery.Although black holes stretch our imagination to the limit, the evidence ismounting that they actually do exist.For example, if black holes are as we have speculated them to be, whateverdisappears in them reappears somewhere. Is it possible, therefore, that thereare black holes in other universes which are sucking matter from those universesinto our universe? This is a seriously considered possibility. There are objectsin our universe that appear to be the reverse of black holes. They are calledwhite holes (of course). These objects are quasi-stellar radio sources, orquasars for short.Quasars are extraordinarily intense energy sources. Most of them are onlyseveral times the diameter of our solar system, yet they emit more energy thanan entire galaxy of over 150 billion stars! Some astronomers believe thatquasars are the most distant objects ever detected, yet their incrediblebrightness allows us to see them clearly.The relationship between black holes and quasars is purely speculation, but thespeculation is mind-boggling. For example, some physicists speculate that blackholes swallow up matter from one universe and pump it either into anotheruniverse or into another part and time of the same universe. The “output” sideof a black hole, according to this hypothesis, is a quasar. If this speculationis correct, then our universe is being sucked into its many black holes, only toreappear in other universes, while other universes are being pumped into our ownuniverse, which is being sucked through black holes and into other universesagain. The process goes on and on, feeding on itself, another beginningless,endless, endless, beginningless dance. One of the most profound by-products of the general theory of relativity is thediscovery that gravitational “force,” which we had so long taken to be a realand independently existing thing, is actually our mental creation. There is nosuch thing in the real world. The planets do not orbit the sun because the sunexerts an invisible gravitational force on them, they follow the paths that theydo because those paths are the easiest ways for them to traverse the terrain ofthe space-time continuum in which they find themselves.The same is true for “nonsense.” It is a mental creation. There is no such thingin the real world. From one frame of reference black holes and event horizonsmake sense. From another frame of reference absolute nonmotion makes sense.Neither is “nonsense” except as seen from another point of view.We call something nonsense if it does not agree with the rational edifices thatwe carefully have constructed. However, there is nothing intrinsically valuableabout these edifices. In fact, they themselves often are replaced by more usefulones. When that happens, what was nonsensical from an old frame of reference canmake sense from a new frame of reference, and the other way round. Likemeasurements of space and time, the concept of nonsense (itself a type ofmeasurement) is relative, and we always can be sure when we use it that fromsome frame of reference it applies to us.image [Images/210.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"PART ONEI CLUTCH MY IDEAS [dancingwulimastersthe_con01.html#pt_05]"},{"pageContent":"1THE PARTICLE ZOO [dancingwulimastersthe_con01.html#ch_09]The fourth translation of Wu Li is “I Clutch My Ideas.” This is appropriate to abook on physics since the history of science in general often has been the storyof scientists vigorously fighting an onslaught of new ideas. This is because itis difficult to relinquish the sense of security that comes from a long andrewarding acquaintance with a particular world view.The value of a physical theory depends upon its usefulness. In this sense thehistory of physical theories might be said to resemble the history of individualpersonality traits. Most of us respond to our environment with a collection ofautomatic responses that once brought desirable results, usually in childhood.Unfortunately, if the environment that produced these responses changes (we growup) and the responses themselves do not adapt, they become counterproductive.Showing anger, becoming depressed, flattering, crying, and bullying behavior areresponse patterns appropriate to times often long past. These patterns changeonly when we are forced to realize that they are no longer productive. Even thenchange is often painful and slow. The same is true of scientific theories.Not one person, except Copernicus, wanted to accept the Copernican idea that theearth revolves around the sun. Goethe wrote about the Copernican revolution:Perhaps a greater demand has never been laid upon mankind; for by this admission[that the earth is not the center of the universe], how much else did notcollapse in dust and smoke: a second paradise, a world of innocence, poetry, andpiety, the witness of the senses, the convictions of a poetic and religiousfaith; no wonder that men had no stomach for all this, that they rangedthemselves in every way against such a doctrine…1Not one physicist, not even Planck himself, wanted to accept the implications ofPlanck’s discovery, for to do so threatened a scientific structure (Newtonianphysics) over three hundred years old. Heisenberg wrote about the quantumrevolution:…when new groups of phenomena compel changes in the pattern of thought…even themost eminent of physicists find immense difficulties. For the demand for changein the thought pattern may engender the feeling that the ground is to be pulledfrom under one’s feet…. I believe that the difficulties at this point can hardlybe overestimated. Once one has experienced the desperation with which clever andconciliatory men of science react to the demand for a change in the thoughtpattern, one can only be amazed that such revolutions in science have actuallybeen possible at all.2Scientific revolutions are forced upon us by the discovery of phenomena that arenot comprehensible in terms of the old theories. Old theories die hard. Muchmore is at stake than the theories themselves. To give up our privilegedposition at the center of the universe, as Copernicus asked, was an enormouspsychological task. To accept that nature is fundamentally irrational (governedby chance), which is the essential statement of quantum mechanics, is a powerfulblow to the intellect. Nonetheless, as new theories demonstrate superiorutility, their adversaries, however reluctantly, have little choice but toaccept them. In so doing, they also must grant a measure of recognition to theworld views that accompany them.Today, particle accelerators, bubble chambers, and computer printouts are givingbirth to another world view. This world view is as different from the world viewat the beginning of this century as the Copernican world view was from itspredecessors. It calls upon us to relinquish many of our closely clutched ideas.In this world view there is no substance.The most common question that we can ask about an object is, “What is it madeof?” That question, however, “What is it made of?” is based upon an artificialmental structure that is much like a hall of mirrors. If we stand directlybetween two mirrors and look into one, we see our reflection, and, just behindourselves, we see a crowd of “us”s, each looking at the back of the head infront of it, stretching backward as far as we can see. These reflections, all ofthem, are illusions. The only real thing in the whole setting is us (we).This situation is very similar to what happens whenever we ask of something,“What is it made of?” The answer to such a question is always another somethingto which we can apply the same question.Suppose, for example, that we ask of an ordinary toothpick, “What is it madeof?” The answer, of course, is “wood.” However, the question itself has taken usinto a hall of mirrors because now we can ask about the wood, “What is it madeof?” Closer examination reveals that wood is made of fibers, but what the fibersare made of is another question, and so on.Like a pair of parallel mirrors, reflecting reflections, gives the illusion ofan unending progression to nowhere, the idea that a thing can be different fromwhat it is made of creates an infinite progression of answers, leaving usforever frustrated in an unending search. No matter what something—anything—is“made of,” we have created an illusion which forces us to ask, “Yes, but what isthat made of?”Physicists are people who have pursued tenaciously this endless series ofquestions. What they have found is startling. Wood fibers, to continue theexample, are actually patterns of cells. Cells, under magnification, arerevealed to be patterns of molecules. Molecules, under higher magnification, arediscovered to be patterns of atoms, and, lastly, atoms have turned out to bepatterns of subatomic particles. In other words, “matter” is actually a seriesof patterns out of focus. The search for the ultimate stuff of the universe endswith the discovery that there isn’t any.If there is any ultimate stuff of the universe, it is pure energy, but subatomicparticles are not “made of” energy, they are energy. This is what Einsteintheorized in 1905. Subatomic interactions, therefore, are interactions of energywith energy. At the subatomic level there is no longer a clear distinctionbetween what is and what happens, between the actor and the action. At thesubatomic level the dancer and the dance are one.According to particle physics, the world is fundamentally dancing energy; energythat is everywhere and incessantly assuming first this form and then that. Whatwe have been calling matter (particles) constantly is being created,annihilated, and created again. This happens as particles interact and it alsohappens, literally, out of nowhere.Where there was “nothing” there suddenly is “something,” and then the somethingis gone again, often changing into something else before vanishing. In particlephysics there is no distinction between empty, as in “empty space,” andnot-empty, or between something and not-something. The world of particle physicsis a world of sparkling energy forever dancing with itself in the form of itsparticles as they twinkle in and out of existence, collide, transmute, anddisappear again.The world view of particle physics is a picture of chaos beneath order. At thefundamental level is a confusion of continual creation, annihilation andtransformation. Above this confusion, limiting the forms that it can take, are aset of conservation laws. They do not specify what must happen, as ordinary lawsof physics do, rather they specify what cannot happen. They are permissive laws.At the subatomic level, absolutely everything that is not forbidden by theconservation laws actually happens. (Quantum theory describes the probabilitiesof the possibilities permitted by the conservation laws).The old world view was a picture of order beneath chaos. It assumed that beneaththe prolific confusion of detail that constitutes our daily experience liesystematic and rational laws which relate them one and all. This was Newton’sgreat insight: The same laws which govern falling apples govern the motion ofplanets. There is still, of course, much truth in this, but the world view ofparticle physics is essentially the opposite.The world view of particle physics is that of a world without “stuff,” wherewhat is = what happens, and where an unending tumultuous dance of creation,annihilation, and transformation runs unabated within a framework ofconservation laws and probability. High-energy particle physics is the study of subatomic particles. It usually isshortened to “particle physics.” Quantum theory and relativity are thetheoretical tools of particle physics. The hardware of particle physics ishoused in unimaginably expensive facilities which couple particle acceleratorsand computers.The original purpose of particle physics was to discover the ultimate buildingblocks of the universe. This was to be accomplished by breaking matter intosmaller and smaller pieces, eventually arriving at the smallest pieces possible.The experimental results of particle physics, however, have not been so simpleToday most particle physicists are engaged in making sense out of their copiousfindings.* [footnote61.html#fn61]In principle, particle physics hardly could be simpler. Physicists sendsubatomic particles smashing into each other as hard as they can. They use oneparticle to shatter another particle so that they can see what the remains aremade of. The particle that does the smashing is called the projectile and theparticle that gets smashed is called the target. The most advanced (andexpensive) particle accelerators send both the projectile and the targetparticles flying toward a common collision point.The collision point usually is located inside a device called a bubble chamber.As charged particles move through a bubble chamber, they leave trails similar tothe vapor trails that jetliners leave in the atmosphere. The bubble chamber islocated inside a magnetic field. This causes particles with a positive charge tocurve in one direction and particles with a negative charge to curve in theopposite direction. The mass of the particle can be determined by the tightnessof the curve that the particle makes (lighter particles curve more than heavierparticles with the same velocity and charge). A computer-triggered camera makesa photograph every time a particle enters the bubble chamber.This elaborate arrangement is necessary because most particles live much lessthan a millionth of a second and are too small to be observed directly.*[footnote62.html#fn62] In general, everything a particle physicist knows aboutsubatomic particles, he deduces from his theories and from photographs of thetracks that particles leave in a bubble chamber.† [footnote63.html#fn63]Bubble chamber photographs, thousands and thousands of them, show clearly thefrustrating situation which early particle physicists encountered in theirsearch for “elementary” particles. When the projectile strikes the target, bothparticles are destroyed at the point of impact. In their place, however, arecreated new particles, all of which are as “elementary” as the originalparticles and often as massive as the original particles!The schematic diagram on the next page shows a typical particle interaction. Aparticle called a negative pi meson (π;-) collides with a proton (p). Both thepi meson and the proton are destroyed and in their place are created two newparticles, a neutral K meson (K0) and a lambda particle (Δ). Both of theseparticles decay spontaneously (no collision necessary) into two additionalparticles, leaving four new particles. Of these four particles, two of them arethe same particles that we started with! It is as though, wrote Finkelstein, wefling two clocks together, they shatter, and out of them come flying not gearsand springs but more clocks, some of them as large as the originals.image [Images/219.jpg]How can this happen? The answer is partly given by Einstein’s special theory ofrelativity. The new particles are created from the kinetic energy (energy ofmotion) of the projectile particle in addition to the mass of the projectileparticle and the mass of the target particle. The faster the projectile particleis traveling, the more kinetic energy is available to create new particles atthe point of impact. For this reason, governments have spent more and more moneyto construct larger and larger particle accelerators which can push projectileparticles to higher and higher velocities. If both the projectile particle andthe target particle are accelerated to the point of impact, so much the morekinetic energy is available to create new particles to study.Every subatomic interaction consists of the annihilation of the originalparticles and the creation of new subatomic particles. The subatomic world is acontinual dance of creation and annihilation, of mass changing to energy andenergy changing to mass.* [footnote64.html#fn64] Transient forms sparkle in andout of existence creating a never-ending, forever-newly-created reality.Mystics from both the East and the West who claim to have beheld “the face ofGod” speak in terms so similar to these that any psychologist who professes aninterest in altered states of awareness scarcely can ignore this obvious bridgebetween the disciplines of physics and psychology. The first question of particle physics is, “What collides?”According to quantum mechanics, a subatomic particle is not a particle like aparticle of dust. Rather, subatomic particles are “tendencies to exist’ and“correlations between macroscopic observables”. They have no objectiveexistence. That means that we cannot assume, if we are to use quantum theory,that particles have an existence apart from their interactions with a measuringdevice. As Heisenberg wrote:In the light of the quantum theory…elementary particles are no longer real inthe same sense as objects of daily life, trees or stones…3When an electron, for example, passes through a photographic plate it leaves avisible “track” behind it. This “track,” under close examination, is actually aseries of dots. Each dot is a grain of silver formed by the electron’sinteraction with atoms in the photographic plate. When we look at the trackunder a microscope, it looks something like this.image [Images/220.jpg]Ordinarily we would assume that one and the same electron, like a littlebaseball, went streaking through the photographic plate and left this trail ofsilver grains behind it. This is a mistake. Quantum mechanics tells us the samething that Tantric Buddhists have been saying for a millennium. The connectionbetween the dots (the “moving object”) is a product of our minds and it is notreally there. In rigorous quantum mechanical terms, the moving object—theparticle with an independent existence—is an unprovable assumption.“According to our customary way of reasoning,” wrote David Bohm, a professor ofphysics at Birkbeck College, University of London,we could suppose that the track of grains of silver indicates that a realelectron moves continuously through space in a path somewhere near these grains,and by interaction caused the formation of the grains. But according to theusual interpretation of the quantum theory, it would be incorrect to supposethat this really happened. All that we can say is that certain grains appeared,but we must not try to imagine that these grains were produced by a real objectmoving through space in the way in which we usually think of objects movingthrough space. For although this idea of a continuously moving object is goodenough for an approximate theory, we would discover that it would break down ina very exact theory.4The natural assumption that objects, like “particles,” are real things that runtheir course in space and time according to causal laws regardless of whether weare around to observe them or not is repudiated by quantum mechanics. This isespecially significant because quantum mechanics is the theory of physics. Ithas explained successfully everything from subatomic particles to stellarphenomena. There never has been a more successful theory. It has no competition.Therefore, when we look at the tracks in a bubble chamber, we are left with thequestion, “What made them?” The best answer that physicists have so far is that“particles” are actually interactions between fields. A field, like a wave, isspread out over a much larger area than a particle (a particle is restricted toone point). A field, moreover, completely fills a given space, like thegravitational field of the earth fills all of the space immediately around it.When two fields interact with each other they interact neither gradually nor atall their areas of contact. Rather, when two fields interact, they do itinstantaneously and at one single point in space (“instantaneously andlocally”). These instantaneous and local interactions make what we callparticles. In fact, according to this theory, these instantaneous and localinteractions are “particles.” The continual creation and annihilation ofparticles at the subatomic level is the result of the continual interaction ofdifferent fields.This theory is called quantum field theory. Some major cornerstones of thetheory were laid in 1928 by the English physicist Paul Dirac. Quantum fieldtheory has been highly successful in predicting new types of particles and inexplaining existing particles in terms of field interactions. According to thistheory, a separate field is associated with each type of particle. Since onlythree types of particles were known in 1928, only three different fields wererequired to explain them. The problem today, however, is that there are over onehundred known particles, which, according to quantum field theory, require overone hundred different fields. This abundance of theoretical fields is somewhatawkward, not to mention embarrassing, to physicists whose goal is to simplifynature. Therefore, most physicists have given up the idea of a separate fieldexisting for each type of particle.Nevertheless, quantum field theory is still an important theory not only becauseit works, but also because it was the first theory to merge quantum mechanicsand relativity, albeit in a limited way. All physical theories, includingquantum theory, must satisfy the requirement of relativity theory that the lawsof physics be independent of the state of motion of the observer. Attempts tointegrate the theory of relativity with quantum theory, however, have beengenerally unsuccessful. Nonetheless, both relativity and quantum theory arerequired, and routinely used, in the understanding of particle physics. Theirforced relationship is best described as strained but necessary. In this regard,one of the most successful integrations of the two is quantum field theory,although it covers only a relatively small range of phenomena.*[footnote65.html#fn65]Quantum field theory is an ad hoc theory. That means that, like Bohr’s famousspecific-orbits-only model of the atom, quantum field theory is a practical butconceptually inconsistent scheme. Some parts of it don’t fit togethermathematically. It is a working model designed around the available data to givephysicists a place to stand in the exploration of subatomic phenomena. Thereason that it has been around so long is that it works so well. (Somephysicists think that it may work too well. They fear that the pragmatic successof quantum field theory impedes the development of a consistent theory.)Even with these well-known shortcomings, the fact is that quantum field theoryis a successful physical theory, and it is premised on the assumption thatphysical reality is essentially nonsubstantial. According to quantum fieldtheory, fields alone are real. They are the substance of the universe and not“matter.” Matter (particles) is simply the momentary manifestations ofinteracting fields which, intangible and insubstantial as they are, are the onlyreal things in the universe. Their interactions seem particle-like becausefields interact very abruptly and in very minute regions of space.“Quantum field theory” is, of course, an outrageous contradiction in terms. Aquantum is an indivisible whole. It is a small piece of something, while a fieldis a whole area of something. A “quantum field” is the juxtaposition of twoirreconcilable concepts. In other words, it is a paradox. It defies ourcategorical imperative that something be either this or that, but not both.The major contribution of quantum mechanics to western thought, and there aremany, may be its impact on the artificial categories by which we structure ourperceptions, since ossified structures of perception are the prisons in which weunknowingly become prisoners. Quantum theory boldly states that something can bethis and that (a wave and a particle).* [footnote66.html#fn66] It makes no senseto ask which of these is really the true description. Both of them are requiredfor a complete understanding.In 1922, Werner Heisenberg, as a student, asked his professor and friend-to-be,Niels Bohr, “If the inner structure of the atom is as closed to descriptiveaccounts as you say, if we really lack a language for dealing with it, how canwe ever hope to understand atoms?”Bohr hesitated for a moment and then said, “I think we may yet be able to do so.But in the process we may have to learn what the word ‘understanding’ reallymeans.”5In human terms, it means that the same person can be good and evil, bold andtimid, a lion and a lamb. All of the above notwithstanding, particle physicists of necessity analyzesubatomic particles as if they were like little baseballs that fly through spaceand collide with each other. When a particle physicist studies a track on abubble-chamber photograph of a particle interaction, he assumes that it was madeby a little moving object, and that the other tracks on the photograph likewisewere made by small moving objects. In fact, particle interactions are analyzedin much the same terms that can be applied to the collision of billiard balls.Some particles collide (and are annihilated in the process) and other newlycreated particles come flying out of the collision area. In short, particleinteractions are analyzed essentially in terms of masses, velocities, andmomenta. These are the concepts of Newtonian physics and they also apply toautomobiles and streetcars.Physicists do this because they have to use these concepts if they are tocommunicate at all. What is available to them is usually a black photograph withwhite lines on it. They know that (1) according to quantum theory, subatomicparticles have no independent existence of their own, (2) subatomic particleshave wave-like characteristics as well as particle-like characteristics, and (3)subatomic particles actually may be manifestations of interacting fields.Nonetheless, these white lines (more patterns) lend themselves to analysis inclassical terms, and so that is how particle physicists analyze them.This dilemma, the dilemma of having to talk in classical terms about phenomenawhich cannot be described in classical concepts is the basic paradox of quantummechanics. It pervades every part of it. It is like trying to explain an LSDexperience. We try to use familiar concepts as points of departure, but beyondthat, the familiar concepts do not fit the phenomena. The alternative is to saynothing at all.“Physicists who deal with the quantum theory,” wrote Heisenberg,are also compelled to use a language taken from ordinary life. We act as ifthere really were such a thing as an electric current [or a particle] because,if we forbade all physicists to speak of electric current [or particles] theycould no longer express their thoughts.6Therefore, physicists talk about subatomic particles as if they were real littleobjects that leave tracks in bubble chambers and have an independent(“objective”) existence. This convention has been extremely productive. Over thelast forty years almost one hundred particles have been discovered. Theyconstitute what Kenneth Ford calls the particle zoo.* [footnote67.html#fn67] The first thing to know about the particle zoo is that every particle of thesame species looks exactly alike. Every electron looks exactly like every otherelectron. If you’ve seen one, you’ve seen them all. Likewise, every proton looksexactly like every other proton, every neutron looks exactly like every otherneutron, and so on. Subatomic particles of the same type are absolutelyindistinguishable.Subatomic particles of different types, however, can be recognized by theirdistinguishing characteristics (properties). The first distinguishingcharacteristic of a subatomic particle is its mass. A proton, for example, hasabout 1800 times more mass than an electron. (This does not necessarily meanthat a proton is 1800 times larger than an electron since mass and size are notthe same thing—a pound of lead and a pound of feathers have the same mass).When physicists refer to the mass of a particle, unless they indicate otherwise,they are referring to the mass of the particle when it is at rest. The mass of aparticle at rest is called its rest mass. Any mass other than a rest mass iscalled a relativistic mass. Since the mass of a particle increases withvelocity, a particle can have any number of relativistic masses. The size of aparticle’s relativistic mass depends upon its velocity. For example, at 99percent of the speed of light a particle’s mass is seven times larger than it iswhen the particle is at rest.At velocities above 99 percent of the speed of light particle masses increasedramatically. When the former electron accelerator at Cambridge, Massachusetts,was in operation, it received electrons from a small feeder accelerator. Theelectrons from the feeder accelerator were fed into the main accelerator at.99986 the velocity of light. The main accelerator then increased the velocityof these electrons to .999999996 the speed of light. This increase in velocitymay look significant, but actually it is negligible. The difference between theinitial velocity of the accelerated electrons and the final velocity of theaccelerated electrons is the same as the difference in velocity between oneautomobile that can make a given trip in two hours and a faster automobile thatcan make the same trip in one hour fifty-nine minutes and fifty-nine seconds.7The mass of each electron, however, increased from 60 times to as much as 11,800times the electron rest mass! In other words, particle accelerators aremisnamed. They do not increase the velocities of subatomic particles (thedefinition of “acceleration”) as much as they increase their mass. Particleaccelerators are actually particle enlargers (massifiers?).The masses of particles, whether at rest or in motion, are measured in electronvolts. An electron volt has nothing to do with electrons. An electron volt is aunit of energy. (It is the energy acquired by any particle with one unit ofcharge falling through a potential difference of one volt.) The point is that tomeasure something in terms of electron volts is to measure its energy, yet thisis precisely the unit of measurement that particle physicists use to measure aparticle’s mass. For example, the rest mass of an electron is .51 millionelectron volts (Mev) and the rest mass of a proton is 938.2 million electronvolts. The transformation of mass into energy and energy into mass is such aroutine phenomenon in particle physics that particle physicists employ units ofenergy to designate a particle’s mass.Mass is only one particular form of energy, the energy of being. If a particleis moving it not only has energy of being (its mass) but it also has energy ofmotion (kinetic energy). Both types of energy can be used to create newparticles in a particle collision.* [footnote68.html#fn68]Often it is easier to compare a particle’s mass with the lightest massiveparticle, the electron, instead of referring to the number of electron volts itcontains. This arrangement makes the mass of an electron one and the mass of aproton, for example, 1836.12. Using this system, the mass of any particle tellsimmediately how much heavier it is than an electron. This is the system that isused in the table at the back of the book.When physicists listed all the known particles by the order of their masses,from the lightest to the heaviest, they discovered that subatomic particles fallinto roughly three categories: the light-weight particles, the medium-weightparticles, and the heavy-weight particles. When it came to naming thesecategories, however, they unaccountably lapsed into Greek again. The group oflight-weight particles they called “leptons,” which is Greek for “the lightones.” The group of medium-weight particles they called “mesons” (maze’ons),which is Greek for “the medium-sized ones.” The group of heavy-weight particlesthey called “baryons” (bary’ons), which is Greek for “the heavy ones.” Whyphysicists did not call these new groups “light,” “medium,” and “heavy” is oneof the unanswerable questions of physics.* [footnote69.html#fn69]Since the electron is the lightest material particle, it is, of course, alepton. The proton is a heavy-weight particle (a baryon), although it is thelightest of the heavy-weight particles. Most subatomic particles are classifiedin this way, but not all of them, which brings us to a phenomenon of particlephysics which, like much of quantum mechanics, escapes the bounds of concept. Afew particles do not fit into the lepton-meson-baryon framework. Some of themare well known (like the photon) and others have been theorized but notdiscovered yet (like the graviton). All of them have in common the fact thatthey are massless particles.“Wait a minute,” we exclaim. “What is a massless particle?”“A massless particle,” says Jim de Wit, who has studied this phenomenon, “is aparticle that has zero rest mass. All of its energy is energy of motion. When aphoton is created, it instantly is traveling at the speed of light. It cannot beslowed down (it has no mass to slow) and it cannot be speeded up (nothing cantravel faster than the speed of light).”“Massless particle” is an awkward translation from mathematics to English.Physicists know exactly what they mean by a massless particle. A “masslessparticle” is the name they give to an element in a mathematical structure. Whatthat element represents in the real world, however, is not so easy to describe.In fact, it is impossible because the definition of an object (like a“particle”) is something that has mass.Zen Buddhists have developed a technique called the koan which, along withmeditation, produces changes in our perceptions and understanding. A koan is apuzzle which cannot be answered in ordinary ways because it is paradoxical.“What is the sound of one hand clapping?” is a Zen koan. Zen students are toldto think unceasingly about a particular koan until they know the answer. Thereis no single correct answer to a koan. It depends upon the psychological stateof the student.Paradoxes are common in Buddhist literature. Paradoxes are the places where ourrational mind bumps into its own limitations. According to eastern philosophy ingeneral, opposites, such as good-bad, beautiful-ugly, birth-death, and so on,are “false distinctions.” One cannot exist without the other. They are mentalstructures which we have created. These self-made and self-maintained illusionsare the sole cause of paradoxes. To escape the bonds of conceptual limitation isto hear the sound of one hand clapping.Physics is replete with koans, i.e., “picture a massless particle.” Is it acoincidence that Buddhists exploring “internal” reality a millennium ago andphysicists exploring “external” reality a millennium later both discovered that“understanding” involves passing the barrier of paradox? The second characteristic of a subatomic particle is its charge. Every subatomicparticle has a positive, a negative, or a neutral charge. Its charge determineshow the particle will behave in the presence of other particles. If a particlehas a neutral charge, it is utterly indifferent to other particles, regardlessof what charge they may have. Particles with positive and negative charges,however, behave quite differently toward each other. Positively and negativelycharged particles are attracted to particles with the opposite sign and repelledby particles with the same sign. Two positively charged particles, for example,find each other’s company quite repulsive and immediately put as much distancebetween themselves as possible. The same is true of two negatively chargedparticles. A negatively charged particle and a positively charged particle, onthe other hand, are irresistibly attracted to each other, and they immediatelymove toward one another if they are able to do so.This dance of attraction and repulsion between charged particles is called theelectromagnetic force. It enables atoms to join together to form molecules andit keeps negatively charged electrons in orbit around positively charged nuclei.At the atomic and molecular level it is the fundamental glue of the universe.Electric charge comes only in one fixed amount. A subatomic particle can have noelectrical charge (neutral), or one unit of electrical charge (either positiveor negative), or, in certain instances, two units of electrical charge, butnothing in between. There is no such thing as a particle with one and one fourthunits of electrical charge, or a particle with 1.7 units of electrical charge.Every subatomic particle has either one whole unit of electrical charge, twowhole units of electrical charge, or no electrical charge at all. In otherwords, like energy (Planck’s discovery) electrical charge is “quantized.” Itcomes in chunks. In the case of electrical charge, all of the chunks are thesame size. Why this is so is one of THE unanswered questions in physics.*[footnote70.html#fn70]When the characteristic of charge is added to the characteristic of mass, aparticle personality, so to speak, begins to emerge. An “electron,” for example,is the only subatomic particle with a rest mass of .51 million electron voltsand a negative charge. With this information a particle physicist knows not onlyhow massive an electron is, he also knows how it will interact with otherparticles. The third characteristic of a subatomic particle is its spin. Subatomicparticles spin about a theoretical kind of axis like a spinning top. One bigdifference between a spinning top and a spinning particle, however, is that atop can spin either faster or slower, but a subatomic particle always spins atexactly the same rate. Every electron, for example, always spins at exactly thesame rate as every other electron.The rate of spin is such a fundamental characteristic of a subatomic particlethat if it is altered, the particle itself is destroyed. That is, if the spin ofa particle is altered, the particle in question is changed so fundamentally thatit no longer can be considered an electron, or a proton, or whatever it wasbefore we altered its spin. This makes us wonder whether all of the different“particles” might be just different states of motion of some underlyingstructure or substance. This is the basic question of particle physics.Every phenomenon in quantum mechanics has a quantum aspect which makes it“discontinuous.” This is also true of spin. Spin is quantized just like energyand charge. It comes in chunks. Like charge, all of the chunks are the samesize. In other words, when a spinning top slows down, its rotation does notdiminish smoothly and continuously, but in a series of tiny steps. These stepsare so small and close together that it is impossible to observe them. The topappears to spin more and more slowly until it stops spinning altogether, butactually, the process is very jerky.It is as if the top could spin, by some strange law that nobody understands,only at 100 revolutions per minute, 90 revolutions per minute, 80 revolutionsper minute, and so on, with absolutely no exceptions in between. If ourhypothetical top wants to spin slower than 100 revolutions per minute, it mustjump all the way down to the next slower speed of 90 revolutions per minute.This is analogous to the situation with subatomic particles except that (1)particular types of particles forever spin at the same speed, and (2) the spinof subatomic articles is calculated in terms of angular momentum.Angular momentum depends upon the mass, size, and rate of rotation of a spinningobject. More of any one of these properties increases the angular momentum ofthe object. In general, angular momentum is the strength of the rotation or, putanother way, the effort required to stop the rotation. The more angular momentuman object has, the more effort is required to stop it from spinning. A spinningtop does not have much angular momentum, because it is small and it has littlemass. A merry-go-round, in comparison, has an enormous angular momentum, notbecause it rotates very fast, but because it is large and it has so much mass.Now that you understand spin, forget everything that you have just learnedexcept the bottom line (angular momentum). Every subatomic particle has a fixed,definite, and known angular momentum, but nothing is spinning! If you don’tunderstand, don’t worry. Physicists don’t understand these words, either. Theyjust use them. (If you try to understand them, they become a koan).*[footnote71.html#fn71]The angular momentum of a subatomic particle is fixed, definite, and known.“But,” wrote Max Born,one should not imagine that there is anything in the nature of matter actuallyrotating.8Said another way, the “spin” of a subatomic particle involves “The idea of aspin without the existence of something spinning…”9 Even Born had to admit thatthis concept is “rather abstruse.”10 (Rather!?) Nonetheless, physicists use thisconcept because subatomic particles do behave as if they have angular momentumand that angular momentum has been determined to be fixed and definite in eachcase. Because of this, in fact, “spin” is one of the major characteristics ofsubatomic particles.The angular momentum of a subatomic particle is based upon our old friend,Planck’s constant. Remember that Planck’s constant, which physicists call “thequantum of action,” was the discovery that set into motion the revolution ofquantum mechanics. Planck discovered that energy is emitted and absorbed notcontinuously, but in small packages which he called quanta. Since that initialdiscovery, Planck’s constant, which represents the quantized nature of energyemission and absorption, has appeared again and again as an essential element inthe understanding of subatomic phenomena. Five years after Planck’s discovery,Einstein used Planck’s constant to explain the photoelectric effect, and laterstill he used it to determine the specific heat of solids, an area far removedfrom Planck’s original study of black-body radiation. Bohr discovered that theangular momentum of electrons as they orbit atomic nuclei is a function ofPlanck’s constant, de Broglie used Planck’s constant to calculate the wavelengthof matter waves, and it is a central element in Heisenberg’s uncertaintyprinciple.As important as Planck’s constant is in the realm of subatomic particles,however, it is entirely unobservable in the world at large. This is because thesize of the packages by which energy is emitted and absorbed is so small thatenergy at our gross level appears to be one continuous flow. Similarly, becausethe indivisible unit of angular momentum is so small, it, too, cannot beobserved in the macroscopic world. A spectator swiveling in his chair at atennis match has 1000000000000000000000000000000000 (1033) times more angularmomentum than an electron. Put another way, a change of one penny in the grossnational product of the United States is a disturbance more than a billionbillion times greater than a change by one unit of the spectator’s angularmomentum.11Instead of writing out the actual angular momentum of a subatomic particle,physicists usually indicate the spin of a subatomic particle by comparing it tothe spin of a photon, whose spin they call one. This system has revealed yetanother unexplainable pattern of subatomic phenomena. Entire families ofparticles have similar spin characteristics. The entire family of leptons, thelight-weight particles, for example, has a spin of ½, which means that they allhave an angular momentum which is ½ of a photon’s angular momentum. The same istrue for the entire family of baryons, the heavy-weight particles. The mesonsalso have peculiar spin characteristics. They spin in such a way that theirangular momenta is always either 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. in relation to the angularmomentum of a photon, but nothing in between (0 = no spin, 1 = the same angularmomentum as a photon, 2 = twice the angular momentum of a photon, etc.). Thespin characteristics of all of the families and all of the particles are in thetable at the back of the book.The values of a particle’s charge, spin and other major characteristics arerepresented by specific numbers. These numbers are called quantum numbers. Everyparticle has a set of quantum numbers which identify it as a particular type ofparticle.* [footnote72.html#fn72] Every particle of a particular type has thesame set of quantum numbers as every other particle of the same type. Everyelectron, for example, has the same quantum numbers as every other electron. Anelectron’s quantum numbers, however, distinguish it from protons, all of whichalso have the same quantum numbers. Individual particles don’t have muchpersonality. In fact, they don’t have any personality at all. When Dirac imposed the requirements of relativity on quantum theory, hisformalism indicated the existence of a particular positively charged particle.Since the only positively charged particle known in those days (1928) was theproton, Dirac, and most other physicists, assumed that his theory had accounted(mathematically) for the proton. (His theory even was criticized for yieldingthe “wrong” proton mass.)Upon closer examination, however, it became evident that Dirac’s theorydescribed not the proton, but an entirely different particle. Dirac’s newparticle was like an electron except that its charge and some of its other majorproperties were exactly opposite to those of an electron.In 1932, Carl Anderson, at Cal Tech (who hadn’t heard of Dirac’s theory)actually discovered this new particle and called it a positron. Physicists laterdiscovered that every particle has a counterpart which is exactly like it butopposite in several major respects. This new class of particles was calledanti-particles. An anti-particle, despite its name, is a particle. (Theanti-particle of an anti-particle is another particle.)Some particles have other particles as anti-particles (for example, a positivepi meson is the anti-particle of a negative pi meson, and the other way round).A few particles are their own anti-particles (like the photon). All of theparticles and their anti-particles are in the table at the back of the book.The meeting of a particle and its anti-particle is always spectacular. Whenevera particle and its anti-particle meet, they annihilate each other! When anelectron meets a positron, for example, both of them disappear and in theirplace are two photons which instantly depart the scene at the speed of light.The particle and the anti-particle literally disappear in a puff of light.Conversely, particles and anti-particles can be created out of energy and alwaysin pairs.The universe is made of both particles and anti-particles. Our part of it,however, is made almost entirely of regular particles which combine into regularatoms to make regular molecules, which make regular matter, which is what we aremade of. Physicists speculate that in other parts of the universe anti-particlescombine into anti-atoms to make anti-molecules, which make anti-matter, which iswhat anti-people would be made of. There are no anti-people in our part of theuniverse because, if there were, they all long since have disappeared in a flashof light. Leptons, mesons, baryons, mass, charge, spin, and anti-particles are some of theconcepts that physicists use to categorize subatomic phenomena when theymomentarily assume that subatomic particles are real objects that move throughspace and time. These concepts are useful, but only in a limited context. Thatcontext is when physicists, for convenience, pretend, as we all do, that dancerscan exist apart from a dance."},{"pageContent":"1THE DANCE [dancingwulimastersthe_con01.html#ch_10]The dance of subatomic particles never ends and it is never the same. However,physicists have found a way to diagram the parts of it that interest them.The simplest drawing of any type of movement is a space map. A space map showsthe location of things in space. The map, for example (first drawing, nextpage), shows the positions of San Francisco, California, and Berkeley,California. The vertical axis is the north-south axis, as on any map, and thehorizontal axis is the east-west line. The map also shows the path of ahelicopter flying between San Francisco and Berkeley and, on a greatly enlargedbasis, it shows the path of a proton traveling around the cyclotron at theLawrence Berkeley Laboratory.Like all road maps, this space map is two-dimensional. It shows how far north(the first dimension) and how far east (the second dimension) Berkeley is of SanFrancisco. It does not show the altitude of the helicopter (the third dimension)and it does not indicate how much time (the fourth dimension) the flight fromSan Francisco to Berkeley required. If we want to show the time involved in theSan Francisco-Berkeley flight we must draw a space-time map.image [Images/237a.jpg]A space-time map shows the positions of things in space and it also shows theirpositions in time. The vertical axis on a space-time map is the time axis.Space-time maps are read from the bottom up because the passage of time isrepresented by movement up the time axis. The horizontal axis of a space-timemap is the space axis which shows the movement of objects in space. The pathtraced by an object on a space-time map is called its “world line.” For example,the space-time map below shows the same flight from San Francisco to Berkeley.image [Images/237b.jpg]Initially the helicopter is sitting on the ground in San Francisco. Its worldline is vertical, because, although it is not moving in space, it is moving intime. A to B is the world line of the helicopter while it sits on its pad in SanFrancisco. When the helicopter takes off for Berkeley it moves forward both intime and space, and its world line traces the path on the space-time map betweenB and C. When it lands in Berkeley its world line is vertical once again becauseit no longer moves in space, but, like all things, it continues to move in time(C to D). The arrowheads show which direction and helicopter is moving. It canmove backward and forward in space but, of course, it only can move forward intime. The dashed lines show the world lines of San Francisco and Berkeley whichdo not move in space at all except during California earthquakes.Physicists use similar space-time maps to diagram particle interactions. Belowis a space-time diagram of an electron emitting a photon.image [Images/238.jpg]Starting at the bottom, an electron moves through space with a certain velocity.At the point in space and time indicated by the dot, it emits a photon. Thephoton flies off at the speed of light to the right and the electron, itsmomentum affected by the emission of the photon, alters course and moves offmore slowly to the left.In 1949, Richard Feynman discovered that space-time maps like these have anexact correspondence with mathematical expressions which give the probabilitiesof the interactions that they depict. Feynman’s discovery was an extension ofDirac’s 1928 theory and it helped to evolve that theory into the quantum fieldtheory that we know today. Therefore, this type of diagram is sometimes called aFeynman diagram.* [footnote73.html#fn73]Here is a Feynman diagram of a particle/anti-particle annihilation. An electronon the left approaches an anti-electron (a positron) which is coming from theright. At their point of contact, indicated by the dot, they mutually annihilateeach other and two photons are created which depart in opposite directions atthe speed of light.† [footnote74.html#fn74]image [Images/239.jpg]A happening in the subatomic world is called an “event.” Events are indicated inFeynman diagrams by dots. Every subatomic event is marked by the annihilation ofthe initial particles and the creation of new ones. This is true for every eventand not only those involving particles and anti-particles.With this in mind, we now can look at the particle diagram again, and see it ina different light. Instead of saying that an electron moving through spaceemitted a photon which changed its (the electron’s) momentum, we can say as wellthat an electron moving through space emitted a photon and went out of existenceat that point! A new electron was created in this process and it departed thescene with a new momentum. There is no way of knowing if this interpretation iscorrect or not because all electrons are identical. However, it is simpler andmore consistent to assume that the original particle was annihilated and a newparticle was created. The indistinguishability of subatomic particles makes thispossible.On the next page is a Feynman diagram of the process that we discussed.A negative pi meson collides with a proton and the two particles areannihilated. Their energy of being (mass) and energy of motion create two newparticles, a lambda particle and a neutral K meson. These two new particles areunstable and live less than a billionth of a second before they decay into otherparticles (actual decay times are in the table at the back of the book). Theneutral K meson decays into a positive pi meson and a negative pi meson. Thelambda particle, and this is the interesting part, decays into the original twoparticles (a negative pi meson and a proton)! It is as if we smash two toyautomobiles together and instead of shattering into bits and pieces, they comeapart into more toy automobiles, some of which are as large as the originals.Subatomic particles forever partake of this unceasing dance of annihilation andcreation. In fact, subatomic particles are this unceasing dance of annihilationand creation. This twentieth-century discovery, with all its psychedelicimplications, is not a new concept. In fact, it is very similar to the way thatmuch of the earth’s population, including the Hindus and the Buddhists, viewtheir reality.image [Images/241.jpg]Hindu mythology is virtually a large-scale projection into the psychologicalrealm of microscopic scientific discoveries. Hindu deities such as Shiva andVishnu continually dance the creation and destruction of universes while theBuddhist image of the wheel of life symbolizes the unending process of birth,death, and rebirth which is a part of the world of form, which is emptiness,which is form.Imagine that a group of young artists have founded a new and revolutionaryschool of art. Their paintings are so unique that they have come to share themwith the curator of an old museum. The curator regards the new paintings, nodshis head, and disappears into the vaults of the museum. He returns carrying somevery old paintings, which he places beside the new ones. The new art is sosimilar to the old art that even the young artists are taken aback. The newrevolutionaries, in their own time and in their own way, have rediscovered avery old school of painting. Let us look again at the Feynman diagram of an electron-positron annihilation.Suppose that we use the arrowhead to indicate which is the particle (theelectron) and which is the anti-particle (the positron) by making the arrowheadsthat point up indicate the particles and the arrowheads that point down indicatethe anti-particles. That would make the diagram look like the drawing below.Naturally, time, as we experience it, only travels in one direction, forward,and that is up on a space-time diagram. Nonetheless, this simple conventionwould give us an easy way of telling particles from anti-particles. World linesthat appear to move forward in time would belong to particles and world linesthat appear to move backward in time would belong to anti-particles. (Photonswould not have arrowheads because they are their own anti-particles.)image [Images/242.jpg]Feynman demonstrated in 1949 that this convention is more than an artisticdevice. He discovered that a positron field propagating forward in time ismathematically the same as an electron field propagating backward in time! Inother words, according to quantum field theory, an anti-particle is a particlemoving backward in time. An anti-particle does not have to be considered as aparticle moving backward in time, but that is the simplest and most symmetricway of viewing anti-particles.For example, because the arrowheads distinguish the particles from theanti-particles, we can twist the original Feynman diagram around into anyposition that we choose and still be able to distinguish the one from the other.Here are some different ways that we can twist the original Feynman diagram.image [Images/243.jpg]Each of these variations is a separate diagram and represents aparticle/anti-particle interaction.* [footnote75.html#fn75] By twisting theoriginal diagram completely around we can represent every possible interactionbetween an electron, a positron, and two photons. The precision, simplicity, andsymmetry of Feynman diagrams make them a special type of poetry. On the next page is a space-time diagram of two events. A collision between twophotons (at B) creates an electron-positron pair and, subsequently, an electronand a positron annihilate each other and create two photons (at A). (The lefthalf of this diagram, the interaction at A, is the same as the electron-positronannihilation.image [Images/244.jpg]Ordinarily we would interpret these events as follows: Two photons collide inthe lower right of the diagram producing an electron-positron pair. The electronflies off to the right while the positron flies off to the left where it meetsanother electron which has entered the diagram from the lower left. There theymutually annihilate and create two photons which depart in opposite directions.The preferred interpretation of quantum field theory, however, is much simpler.In it there is only one particle. That particle, an electron, enters the diagramfrom the lower left and travels forward in time and space until it emits twophotons at A. This causes it to reverse its direction in time. Travelingbackward in time as a positron it absorbs two photons at B, reverses itsdirection in time again, and again becomes an electron. Instead of threeparticles there is only one particle which, moving from left to right, travelsfirst forward in time, then backward in time, and then forward in time again.This is the static type of space-time picture described in Einstein’s theory ofrelativity. If we could survey an entire span of time as we can survey an entireregion of space, we would see that events do not unfold with the flow of timebut present themselves complete, like a finished painting on the fabric ofspace-time. In such a picture movements backward and forward in time are no moresignificant than movements backward and forward in space.The illusion of events “developing” in time is due to our particular type ofawareness which allows us to see only narrow strips of the total space-timepicture one at a time. For example, suppose that we place a piece of cardboardwith a narrow strip cut out of it over the diagram so that all we can see of theinteraction is what is visible through the cut-out. If we move the cardboardslowly upward, starting at the bottom, our restricted view discovers a series ofevents, each one happening after the other.image [Images/245.jpg]First, we see three particles, two photons entering our view on the right and anelectron entering from the left (1). Next, we see the photons collide to producean electron-positron pair, the electron flying off to the right and the positronflying off to the left (2). Finally, we see the newly created positron meet theoriginal electron to create two new photons (3). Only when we remove the entirecardboard (which was an artificial construction anyway) can we see the completepicture.“In space-time,” wrote de Broglie,everything which for each of us constitutes the past, the present, and thefuture is given in block…. Each observer, as his time passes, discovers, so tospeak, new slices of space-time which appear to him as successive aspects of thematerial world, though in reality the ensemble of events constituting space-timeexist prior to his knowledge of them.1“Wait a minute,” says Jim de Wit to a passing particle physicist. “It is easy totalk of movement backward and forward in time, but I never have experiencedgoing backward in time. If particles can travel backward in time, why can’t Itravel backward in time?”The answer which physicists gave to this question is actually quite simple:There is a growing tendency in any closed part of the universe, theirexplanation goes, for disorder (called “entropy”) to expand at the price oforder (called “negentropy”). Suppose, for example, that we deposit a drop ofblack ink into a glass of clear water. Initially its presence is quite ordered.That is, all of the molecules of ink are located in one small area and areclearly segregated from the molecules of clear water.As time passes, however, natural molecular motion will cause the black inkmolecules steadily to intersperse with the clear water molecules until they aredistributed evenly throughout the glass, resulting in a murky homogeneous liquidwith no structure or order whatever—only a bland uniformity (maximal entropy).Experience has taught us to associate increasing entropy with the forwardmovement of time. If we see a movie of a glass of murky water becoming clearerand clearer until all of the foreign substance in it collects into one smalldrop at the top, we know at once that the film is running backward. Of course,it is theoretically possible for this to happen, but it is so improbable that itsimply never (probably) will happen. In short, time “flows” in the direction ofhigh probability, which is the direction of increasing entropy.The theory of growing disorder, or “increasing entropy,” is called the secondlaw of thermodynamics. The second law of thermodynamics is statistical. Thatmeans it won’t work unless there are many entities in a given situation to applyit to. Generally speaking, individual subatomic particles are conceived as suchconceptually isolated, short-lived entities that the second law ofthermodynamics does not apply to them.* [footnote76.html#fn76], †[footnote77.html#fn77] It does apply, however, to molecules, which are quitecomplex compared to subatomic particles; to living cells, which are more complexthan molecules; and to people, who are made of billions of cells. It is only atthe subatomic, or quantum, level that the forward flow of time loses itssignificance.However, there is speculation, and some evidence, that consciousness, at themost fundamental levels, is a quantum process. The dark-adapted eye, forexample, can detect a single photon. If this is so then it is conceivable thatby expanding our awareness to include functions which normally lie beyond itsparameters (the way yogis control their body temperature and pulse rate) we canbecome aware of (experience) these processes themselves. If, at the quantumlevel, the flow of time has no meaning, and if consciousness is fundamentally asimilar process, and if we can become aware of these processes within ourselves,then it also is conceivable that we can experience timelessness.If we can experience the most fundamental functions of our psyche, and if theyare quantum in nature, then it is possible that the ordinary conceptions ofspace and time might not apply to them at all (as they don’t seem to apply indreams). Such an experience would be difficult to describe rationally (“Infinityin a grain of sand/And eternity in an hour”), but it would be very real, indeed.For this reason, reports of time distortion and timelessness from gurus in theEast and psychotropic drug users in the West ought not, perhaps, to be discardedpreemptorily. Subatomic particles do not just sit around being subatomic particles. They arebeehives of activity. An electron, for example, constantly is emitting andabsorbing photons. These photons are not full-fledged photons, however. They area now-you-see-it-now-you-don’t variety. They are exactly like real photonsexcept that they don’t fly off on their own. They are re-absorbed by theelectron almost as soon as they are emitted. Therefore, they are called“virtual” photons. (“Virtual” means “being so in effect or essence, although notin actual fact.”) They are virtually photons. The only thing that keeps themfrom being full-fledged photons is their abrupt re-absorption by the electronthat emits them.* [footnote78.html#fn78]In other words, first there is an electron, then there is an electron and aphoton, and then there is an electron again. This situation is, of course, aviolation of the conservation law of mass-energy. The conservation law ofmass-energy says, in effect, that we cannot get something for nothing. Accordingto quantum field theory, however, we do get something for nothing, but only forabout one thousand trillionth (10-15) of a second. † [footnote79.html#fn79] Thereason that this can happen, according to the theory, is the famous Heisenberguncertainty principle.The Heisenberg uncertainty principle, as it originally was formulated, says thatthe more certain we are of the position of a particle, the less certain we canbe about its momentum, and the other way round. We can determine its positionprecisely, but in that case we cannot determine its momentum at all. If wechoose to measure its momentum precisely, then we will not be able to know whereit is located.In addition to the reciprocal uncertainty of position and momentum, there alsois a reciprocal uncertainty of time and energy. The less uncertainty there isabout the time involved in a subatomic event, the more uncertainty there isabout the energy involved in the event (and the other way round). A measurementas accurate as one thousand trillionth of a second leaves very littleuncertainty about the time involved in the emission and absorption of a virtualphoton. It does, however, cause a specific uncertainty about how much energy wasinvolved. Because of this uncertainty, the balance books kept by theconservation law of mass-energy are not upset. Said another way, the eventhappens and is over with so quickly that the electron can get away with it.It is as if the policeman who enforces the conservation law of mass-energy turnshis back on violations if they happen quickly enough. However, the more flagrantthe violation, the more quickly it must happen.If we provide the necessary energy for a virtual photon to become a real photonwithout violating the conservation law of mass-energy, it does just that. Thatis why an excited electron emits a real photon. An excited electron is anelectron that is in an energy level higher than its ground state. An electron’sground state is its lowest energy level where it is as close to the nucleus ofan atom as it can get. The only photons that electrons emit when they are intheir ground state are virtual photons which they immediately re-absorb so asnot to violate the conservation law of mass-energy.An electron considers the ground state to be its home. It doesn’t like to leavehome. In fact, the only time it leaves its ground state is when it literally ispushed out of it with extra energy. In that case, the electron’s first concernis to get back to its ground state (provided that it hasn’t been pushed so farfrom the nucleus that, in effect, it becomes a free electron). Since the groundstate is a low-energy state, the electron must lose its excess energy before itcan return to it. Therefore, when an electron is at an energy level higher thanits ground state, it jettisons its excess energy in the form of a photon. Thejettisoned photon is one of the electron’s virtual photons that suddenly findsitself with enough energy to keep going without violating the conservation lawof mass-energy, and it does. In other words, one of the electron’s virtualphotons suddenly is “promoted” to a real photon. The amount of energy (thefrequency) of the promoted photon depends upon how much excess energy theelectron had to jettison. (The discovery that electrons emit only photons ofcertain energies and no others is what made the quantum theory a quantumtheory). Electrons are always surrounded by a swarm of virtual photons.*[footnote80.html#fn80]If two electrons come close enough to each other, close enough so that theirvirtual-photon clouds overlap, it is possible that a virtual photon that isemitted from one electron will be absorbed by the other electron. Below is aFeynman diagram of a virtual photon being emitted by one electron and absorbedby another electron.image [Images/250.jpg]The closer the electrons come to each other, the more this phenomenon occurs. Ofcourse, the process is two-way with both electrons absorbing virtual photonsthat were emitted by the other.This is how electrons repel each other. The closer two electrons come, the morevirtual photons they exchange. The more virtual photons they exchange, the moresharply their paths are deflected. The “repulsive force” between them is simplythe cumulative effect of these exchanges of virtual photons, the number of whichincreases at close range and decreases at a distance. According to this theory,there is no such thing as action-at-a-distance—only more and fewer exchanges ofvirtual photons. These interactions (absorptions and emissions) happen onlocation, so to speak, right there where the particles involved are located.*[footnote81.html#fn81]The mutual repulsion of two particles of the same charge, like two electrons, isan example of an electromagnetic force. In fact, according to quantum fieldtheory, an electromagnetic force is the mutual exchange of virtual photons.(Physicists like to say that the electromagnetic force is “mediated” byphotons.) Every electrically charged particle continually emits and re-absorbsvirtual photons and/or exchanges them with other charged particles. When twoelectrons (two negative charges) exchange virtual photons, they repulse eachother. The same thing happens when two protons (two positive charges) exchangevirtual photons. When a proton and an electron (a positive charge and a negativecharge) exchange virtual photons they attract each other.Therefore, since the development of quantum field theory, physicists generallyhave substituted the word “interaction” for the word “force.” (An interaction iswhen anything influences anything else). In this context—a mutual exchange ofvirtual photons—it is a more precise term than “force,” which labels that whichhappens between electrons but does not say anything about it. That part ofquantum field theory (Dirac’s original part) which deals with electrons,photons, and positrons is called quantum electrodynamics. Virtual photons, even if they were charged particles, would not be visible in abubble chamber because of their extremely short lives. Their existence isinferred mathematically. Therefore, this extraordinary theory, that particlesexert a force on each other by exchanging other particles, clearly is a “freecreation” of the human mind. It is not necessarily how nature “really is,” it isonly a mental construction which correctly predicts what nature probably isgoing to do next. There might be, and probably are, other mental constructs thatcan do as good a job as this one, or better (although physicists have not beenable to think of them). The most that we can say about this or any other theoryis not whether it is “true” or not, but only whether it works or not; that is,whether it does what it is supposed to do.Quantum theory is supposed to predict the probabilities of given subatomicphenomena to occur under certain circumstances. Even though quantum field theoryas a whole is not totally consistent, the pragmatic reality is that it works.There is a Feynman diagram for every interaction, and every Feynman diagramcorresponds to a mathematical formula which precisely predicts the probabilityof the diagrammed interaction to happen.* [footnote82.html#fn82]In 1935, Hideki Yukawa, a graduate student in physics, decided to apply the newvirtual particle theory to the strong force. The strong force is the force that keeps atomic nuclei together. It has to bestrong because the protons, which along with the neutrons make up the nucleus ofan atom, naturally repel each other. Being particles of like sign (positive),protons want to be as far away from each other as they can get. This is becauseof the electromagnetic force between them. However, within the nucleus of anatom, these mutually repulsive protons not only are kept in close proximity, butthey also are bound together very tightly. Whatever is binding these protonstogether into a nucleus, physicists reasoned, must be a very strong forcecompared to the electromagnetic force, which works against it. Therefore, theydecided to call the strong force, naturally, the “strong force.”The strong force is well named because it is one hundred times stronger than theelectromagnetic force. It is the strongest force known in nature. Like theelectromagnetic force, it is a fundamental glue. The electromagnetic force holdsatoms together externally (with each other to form molecules) and internally (itbinds electrons to their orbits around atomic nuclei). The strong force holdsthe nucleus itself together.The strong force is somewhat musclebound, so to speak. Although it is thestrongest force known in nature, it also has the shortest range of all theforces known in nature. For example, as a proton approaches the nucleus of anatom it begins to experience the repulsive electromagnetic force between itselfand the protons within the nucleus. The closer the free proton gets to theprotons in the nucleus, the stronger the repulsive electromagnetic force betweenthem becomes. (At one third the original distance, for example, the force isnine times as strong). This force causes a deflection in the path of the freeproton. The deflection is a gentle one if the proton is distant from the nucleusand very pronounced if the proton should come close to the nucleus.However, if we push the free proton to within about one ten-trillionth (10-13)of a centimeter of the nucleus, it suddenly is sucked into the nucleus with aforce one hundred times more powerful than the repulsive electromagnetic force.One ten-trillionth of a centimeter is about the size of the proton itself. Inother words, the proton is relatively unaffected by the strong force, even at adistance only slightly greater than its own magnitude. Closer than that,however, and it is completely overpowered by the strong force.Yukawa decided to explain this powerful but very short-range “strong” force interms of virtual particles.The strong force, theorized Yukawa, is “mediated” by virtual particles like theelectromagnetic force is “mediated” by virtual photons. According to Yukawa’stheory, just as the electromagnetic force is the exchange of virtual photons,the strong force is the exchange of another type of virtual particle. Just aselectrons never sit idle, but constantly emit and re-absorb virtual photons, sonucleons are not inert, but constantly emit and re-absorb their own type ofvirtual particles.A “nucleon” is a proton or a neutron. Both of these particles are callednucleons, since both of them are found in the nuclei of atoms. They are sosimilar to each other that a proton, roughly speaking, can be considered as aneutron with a positive charge.Yukawa knew the range of the strong force from the results of publishedexperiments. Assuming that the limited range of the strong force was identicalto the limited range of a virtual particle emitted from a nucleon in thenucleus, he calculated how much time such a virtual particle would require, atclose to the speed of light, to go that distance and return to the nucleon. Thistime calculation allowed him to use the uncertainty relation between time andenergy to calculate the energy (mass) of his hypothetical particle.Twelve years and one case of mistaken identity later, physicists discoveredYukawa’s hypothetical particle.* [footnote83.html#fn83] They called it a meson.An entire family of mesons, it later was discovered, are the particles whichnucleons exchange to constitute the strong force. The particular meson whichphysicists discovered first, they called a pion. “Pion” is short for pi(pronounced “pie”) meson. Pions come in three varieties: positive, negative, andneutral.In other words, a proton, like an electron, is a beehive of activity. Not onlydoes it continually emit and re-absorb virtual photons, which makes itsusceptible to the electromagnetic force, it also emits and re-absorbs virtualpions, which makes it susceptible to the strong force as well. (Particles whichdo not emit virtual mesons, like electrons, for example, are not affected at allby the strong force). When an electron emits a virtual photon which is absorbed by another particle,the electron is said to be “interacting” with the other particle. However, whenan electron emits a virtual photon and then re-absorbs it, the electron is saidto be interacting with itself. Selfinteraction makes the world of subatomicparticles a kaleidoscopic reality whose very constituents are themselvesunceasing processes of transformation.Protons, like electrons, can interact with themselves in more ways than one. Thesimplest proton self-interaction is the emission and re-absorption, within thetime permitted by the uncertainty principle, of a virtual pion. This interactionis analogous to an electron emitting and re-absorbing a virtual photon. Firstthere is a proton, then there is a proton and a neutral pion, then there is aproton again. Below is a Feynman diagram of a proton emitting and re-absorbing avirtual neutral pion.image [Images/255.jpg]Because all protons are identical, we can assume that the original protonsuddenly ceases to exist and that, at the same point in space and time, anotherproton and a neutral pion just as abruptly come into existence. The new protonand the neutral pion constitute a violation of the conservation law ofmass-energy since their mass together is greater than the mass of the originalproton. Something (the neutral pion) literally has been created out of nothingand quickly disappears again (making this a virtual process). The life span ofthe new particles is limited to the time calculated via the Heisenberguncertainty principle. They quickly merge, annihilating each other, and createanother proton. One blink of an eye, figuratively speaking, and the whole thingis over.There is another way in which a proton can interact with itself. In addition toemitting and re-absorbing a neutral pion, a proton can emit a positive pion.However, by emitting a positive pion, the proton momentarily transforms itselfinto a neutron! First there is a proton, then there is a neutron (which byitself has more mass than the original proton) plus a positive pion, then thereis a proton again. In other words, one of the dances that a proton doescontinually changes it into a neutron and back into a proton again. Below is aFeynman diagram of this dance.image [Images/256.jpg]Every nucleon is surrounded by a cloud of virtual pions, which it constantlyemits and re-absorbs. If a proton comes close enough to a neutron so that theirvirtual-pion clouds overlap, some of the virtual pions emitted by the proton areabsorbed by the neutron. On the next page is a Feynman diagram of a virtual-pionexchange between a proton and a neutron.In the left half of the diagram, a proton emits a positively charged pion,momentarily transforming itself into a neutron. Before the pion can bere-absorbed, however, it is captured by a nearby neutron. This pion capturecauses the neutron to transform itself into a proton. The exchange of thepositive pion causes the proton to become a neutron and the neutron to become aproton. The two original nucleons, now bound together by this exchange, havechanged roles.This is the basic Yukawa interaction. The strong force, as Yukawa theorized in1935, is the multiple exchange of virtual pions between nucleons. The number ofthe exchanges (the strength of the force) increases at close range and decreasesat a distance.In a similar manner, neutrons never sit still and just be neutrons. Like protonsand electrons they also constantly interact with themselves by emitting andre-absorbing virtual particles. Like protons, neutrons emit and re-absorbneutral pions. On the top of the next page is a Feynman diagram of a neutronemitting and re-absorbing a neutral pion.image [Images/257.jpg]In addition to emitting a neutral pion, a neutron also can emit a negative pion.However, when a neutron emits a negative pion, it momentarily transforms itselfinto a proton! First there is neutron, then there is a proton plus a negativepion, then there is a neutron again. Below is a Feynman diagram of this dancewhich continually changes a neutron into a proton and back into a neutron again.image [Images/258a.jpg]image [Images/258b.jpg]If a neutron comes so close to a proton that their virtual pion clouds overlap,some of the pions that are emitted by the neutron are absorbed by the proton.Below is a Feynman diagram of a virtual-pion exchange between a neutron and aproton.This is another strong-force interaction. In the left half of the diagram, aneutron emits a negative pion, temporarily transforming itself into a proton.However, before the negative pion can be re-absorbed, it is captured by a nearbyproton which, in turn, becomes a neutron. The exchange of a negative pion causesa neutron to become a proton and a proton to become a neutron. As before, a pairof nucleons, bound together by a virtual-pion exchange, have changed roles.There are many more strong-force interactions. Although pions are the particlesmost often exchanged in the creation of the strong force, the other mesons (suchas kaons, eta particles, etc.) are exchanged as well. There is no “strongforce”; there are only a varying number of virtual-particle exchanges betweennucleons.image [Images/259.jpg]The universe, according to physicists, is held together by four fundamentaltypes of glue. In addition to the strong force and the electromagnetic force,there is the “weak” force and the gravitational force.* [footnote84.html#fn84]Gravity is the long-range force which holds together solar systems, galaxies,and universes. However, on the subatomic level its effect is so negligible thatit is ignored altogether. Future theories, hopefully, will be able to take itinto account.† [footnote85.html#fn85]The weak force is the least known of the four forces. Its existence was inferredfrom the times required by certain subatomic interactions. The strong force isso short-range and powerful that strong-force interactions happen very, veryfast, in about .00000000000000000000001 (10-23) seconds. However, physicistsdiscovered that a certain other type of particle interaction which they knewinvolved neither the electromagnetic nor the gravitational forces, required amuch longer time, about .0000000001 (10-10) seconds. They therefore deduced fromthis strange phenomenon that there must exist a fourth type of force. Since thisnew fourth force was known to be weaker than the electromagnetic force, it wascalled the weak force.In the order of their strength, the four forces are:Strong (nuclear) forceElectromagnetic forceWeak forceGravitySince the strong force and the electromagnetic force can be explained in termsof virtual particles, physicists assume that the same is true of the weak forceand gravity. The particle associated with gravity is the graviton, whoseproperties have been theorized, but whose existence never has been confirmed.The particle associated with the weak force is the “W” particle, about whichmuch has been theorized, but not much has been discovered. The range of the strong force, relative to the electromagnetic force, is limitedbecause mesons, relative to photons, have so much mass. Remember that thepoliceman who enforces the conservation law of mass-energy is willing to turnhis back if the violation is quick enough, but the more flagrant the violation,the more quickly it must happen. The momentary creation of a meson out ofnothing is a much more flagrant violation of the conservation law of mass-energythan the momentary creation of a photon out of nothing. Therefore, the creationand re-absorption of a meson must happen more quickly to stay within theprotection, so to speak, of the uncertainty relation between time and energy.Because the life span of a virtual meson is limited, its range also is limited.The rule of thumb governing this phenomenon is this: The stronger the force, themore massive is the mediating particle, and the shorter is its range. The rangeof the strong force is only about one ten-trillionth (10-13) of a centimeter.Accordingly, the range of the electromagnetic force is much greater than therange of the strong force. In fact, the range of the electromagnetic force isinfinite. This is because photons don’t have any rest mass!“Wait a minute,” says Jim de Wit, agreeing with us for a change. “This doesn’tmake sense. A virtual photon is a photon which is emitted and re-absorbedquickly enough to avoid violating the conservation law of mass-energy. Right?”“Right,” says a particle physicist on his way to the cyclotron.“Then how can a particle, or anything else, be emitted and re-absorbed withincertain time limits, like the time limits imposed by the uncertainty principle,and still have an infinite range? It doesn’t make sense.”De Wit has a point. At first glance it appears that he is correct. On closerexamination, however, there is a subtle logic involved which does make sense. Ifthe limitations of the conservation law of mass-energy are avoided by a balanceof time and energy (mass) permitted by the uncertainty principle, and a virtualphoton has no (rest) mass, then it has all the time in the world, literally, togo where it pleases. In other words, there is no practical difference between a“real” photon and a “virtual” photon. The only difference between them is thatthe creation of a “real” photon does not violate the conservation law ofmass-energy and the creation of a “virtual” photon avoids the law momentarilyvia the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.This is a good example of how “unreal” and “ivory-tower-like” thenonmathematical explanation of a successful physical theory can sound. Thereason for this is that physical theories, in order to describe more accuratelythe phenomena under consideration, have become more and more divorced fromeveryday experience (i.e., more abstract). Although these highly abstracttheories, such as quantum theory and relativity, are unaccountably accurate toan awesome degree, they truly are “free creations” of the human mind. Theirprimary link with ordinary experience is not the abstract content of theirformalisms, but the fact that, somehow, they work.* [footnote86.html#fn86] The distinction between a transient, virtual (nothing-something-nothing) stateand a “real” one (something-something-something) is similar to the Buddhistdistinction between reality as it actually is and the way that we usually seeit. For example, Feynman himself described the difference between a virtualstate and a real state (of a photon) as a matter of perspective.…what looks like a real process from one point of view may appear as a virtualprocess occurring over a more extended time.For example, if we wish to study a given real process, such as the scattering oflight, we can, if we wish, include in principle the source, scatterer, andeventual absorber of the scattered light in our analysis. We may imagine that nophoton is present initially, and that the source then emits light…. The light isthen scattered and eventually absorbed…. From this point of view the process isvirtual, that is, we start with no photons and end with none. Thus we cananalyze the process by means of our formulas for real processes by attempting tobreak the analysis into parts corresponding to emission, scattering, andabsorption.2According to Buddhist theory, reality is “virtual” in nature. What appear to be“real” objects in it, like trees and people, actually are transient illusionswhich result from a limited mode of awareness. The illusion is that parts of anoverall virtual process are “real” (permanent) “things.” “Enlightenment” is theexperience that “things,” including “I,” are transient, virtual states devoid ofseparate existences, momentary links between illusions of the past and illusionsof the future unfolding in the illusion of time. Particle self-interactions become quite intricate when virtual particles emitvirtual particles which emit virtual particles in a diminishing sequence. On thenext page is a Feynman diagram of a virtual particle (a negative pion)transforming itself momentarily into two more virtual particles, a neutron andan anti-proton (Dirac’s 1928 theory also predicted anti-protons which werediscovered at Berkeley in 1955).This is the simplest example of self-interaction. On the exquisite dance of asingle proton performed in the flicker of time permitted by the uncertaintyprinciple. This diagram was constructed by Kenneth Ford in his book, The Worldof Elementary Particles.3 Eleven particles make their transient appearancebetween the time the original proton transforms itself into a neutron and a pionand the time it becomes a single proton again.A proton never remains a simple proton. It alternates between being a proton anda neutral pion on the other hand, and being a neutron and a neutral pion on theother hand. A neutron never remains a simple neutron. It alternates betweenbeing a neutron and a neutral pion on the one hand, and being a proton and anegative pion on the other hand. A negative pion never remains a simple negativepion. It alternates between being a neutron and an anti-proton on the one hand,etc., etc. In other words, all particles exist potentially (with a certainprobability) as different combinations of other particles. Each combination hasa certain probability of happening.image [Images/264.jpg]Quantum theory deals with probability. The probability of each of thesecombinations can be calculated with accuracy. According to quantum theory,however, it is ultimately chance that determines which of these combinationsactually occur.The quantum view that all particles exist potentially as different combinationsof other particles parallels a Buddhist view, again. According to The FlowerGarland Sutra, each part of physical reality is constructed of all the otherparts. (A sutra is a written account of the Buddha’s teachings.) This theme isillustrated in The Flower Garland Sutra by the metaphor of Indra’s net. Indra’snet is a vast network of gems which overhangs the palace of the god Indra.image [Images/265.jpg]In the words of an English interpreter:In the heaven of Indra, there is said to be a network of pearls, so arrangedthat if you look at one you see all the others reflected in it. In the same wayeach object in the world is not merely itself but involves every other objectand in fact is everything else.4The appearance of physical reality, according to Mahayana Buddhism, is basedupon the interdependence of all things.* [footnote87.html#fn87], †[footnote88.html#fn88]Although this book is not about physics and Buddhism specifically, thesimilarities between the two, especially in the field of particle physics, areso striking and plentiful that a student of one necessarily must find value inthe other. Now we come to the most psychedelic aspect of particle physics. Below is aFeynman diagram of a three-particle interaction.image [Images/266.jpg]In this diagram no world line leads up to the interaction and no world lineleads away from it. It just happens. It happens literally out of nowhere, for noapparent reason, and without any apparent cause. Where there was no-thing,suddenly, in a flash of spontaneous existence, there are three particles whichvanish without a trace.This type of Feynman diagram is called a “vacuum diagram.*[footnote89.html#fn89] That is because the interactions happen in a vacuum. A“vacuum,” as we normally construe it, is a space that is entirely empty. Vacuumdiagrams, however, graphically demonstrate that there is no such thing. From“empty space” comes something, and then that something disappears again into“empty space.”In the subatomic realm, a vacuum obviously is not empty. So where did the notionof a completely empty, barren, and sterile “space” come from? We made it up!There is no such thing in the real world as “empty space.” It is a mentalconstruction, an idealization, which we have taken to be true.“Empty” and “full” are “false distinctions” that we have created, like thedistinction between “something” and “nothing.” They are abstractions fromexperience which we have mistaken for experience. Perhaps we have lived so longin our abstractions that instead of realizing that they are drawn from the realworld we believe that they are the real world.Vacuum diagrams are the serious product of a well-intentioned physical science.However, they also are wonderful reminders that we can intellectually create our“reality.” It is not possible, according to our usual conceptions, for“something” to come out of “empty space”; but, at the subatomic level, it does,which is what vacuum diagrams illustrate. In other words, there is no such thingas “empty space” (or “nothing”) except as a concept in our categorizing minds.The core sutras of Mahayana Buddhism (the type of Buddhism practiced in Tibet,China, and Japan) are called the Prajnaparamita Sutras.† [footnote90.html#fn90]Among the most central of the Prajnaparamita Sutras (there are twelve volumes ofthem) is a sutra which is called simply, The Heart Sutra. The Heart Sutracontains one of the most important ideas of Mahayana Buddhism:…form is emptiness, emptiness is form.Below is a vacuum diagram of six different mutually interacting particles.image [Images/268.jpg]It depicts an exquisite dance of emptiness becoming form and form becomingemptiness. Perhaps, as the wise people of the East have written, form isemptiness and emptiness is form.In any case, vacuum diagrams are representations of remarkable transformationsof “something” into “nothing” and “nothing” into “something.” Thesetransformations occur continuously in the subatomic realm and are limited onlyby the uncertainty principle, the conservation laws, and probability.*[footnote91.html#fn91] There are roughly twelve conservation laws. Some of them affect every type ofsubatomic interaction. Some of them affect only some types of subatomicinteraction. There is a simple rule of thumb to remember: The stronger theforce, the more its interactions are restrained by conservation laws. Forexample, strong interactions are restrained by all twelve conservation laws;electromagnetic interactions are restrained by eleven of the conservation laws;and weak interactions are restrained by only eight of the conservation laws.†[footnote92.html#fn92] Gravitational interactions, those involving the mostfeeble force in the subatomic world, have not been studied yet (no one has founda graviton), but they may violate even more conservation laws.Nonetheless, where the conservation laws have jurisdiction, they are inviolablerules which shape the form of all particle interactions. For example, theconservation law of mass-energy dictates that all spontaneous particle decays be“downhill.” When a single particle spontaneously decays, it always decays intolighter particles. The total mass of the new particles is always less than themass of the original particle. The difference between the mass of the originalparticle and the total mass of the new particles is converted into the kineticenergy of the new particles (which fly away).“Uphill” interactions are only possible when kinetic energy, in addition to theenergy of being (mass) of the original particles, is available for the creationof new particles. Two colliding protons, for example, can create a proton, aneutron, and a positive pion. The total mass of these new particles is greaterthan the mass of the two original protons. This is possible because some of thekinetic energy of the projectile proton went into the creation of the newparticles.In addition to mass-energy, momentum is conserved in every particle interaction.The total momentum carried by particles going into an interaction must equal thetotal momentum of the particles leaving the interaction. This is why thespontaneous decay of a single particle always produces at least two newparticles. A particle at rest has zero momentum. If it decays into a single newparticle which then flies off, the momentum of the new particle will exceed themomentum of the original particle (zero). The momenta of at least two newparticles flying off in opposite directions, however, cancel each other,producing a total momentum of zero.Charge also is conserved in every particle interaction. If the total charge ofthe particles entering an interaction is plus two (for example, two protons),the total charge of the particles leaving the interaction must also equal plustwo (after the positive and negative particles cancel each other). Spin, too, isconserved, although keeping the books balanced in regard to spin is morecomplicated than it is in regard to charge.In addition to the conservation laws of mass-energy, momentum, charge, and spin,there are conservation laws of family numbers. For example, if two baryons, orheavy-weight particles (like two protons), go into an interaction, two baryonsmust be among the resulting new particles (like a neutron and a lambdaparticle).This same baryon conservation law, along with the conservation law ofmass-energy, “explains” why protons are stable particles (i.e., why they do notdecay spontaneously). Spontaneous decays must be downhill to satisfy theconservation law of mass-energy. Protons cannot decay downhill without violatingthe conservation law of baryon family numbers because protons are the lightestbaryons. If a proton were to decay spontaneously, it would have to decay intoparticles lighter than itself, but there are no baryons lighter than a proton.In other words, if a proton were to decay, there would be one less baryon in theworld. In fact, this never happens. This scheme (the conservation law of baryonfamily numbers) is the only way that physicists so far have been able to accountfor the proton’s stability. A similar conservation law of lepton family numbersaccounts for the stability of electrons. (There are no lighter leptons than anelectron.)Some of the twelve conservation laws are actually “invariance principles.” Aninvariance principle is a law that says, “under a change of circumstances (likechanging the location of an experiment) all of the laws of physics remainvalid.” “All of the laws of physics,” so to speak, is the “conserved quantity”of an invariance principle. For example, there is a time-reversal invarianceprinciple. In order for a process to be possible, according to this principle,it must be reversible in time. If a positron-electron annihilation can createtwo photons (it can), then the annihilation of two photons can create a positronand an electron (it can).Conservation laws and invariance principles are based on what physicists callsymmetries. The fact that space is the same in all directions (isotropic) and inall places (homogeneous) is an example of symmetry. The fact that time ishomogeneous is another example. These symmetries simply mean that a physicsexperiment performed in Boston this spring will give the same result as the sameexperiment performed in Moscow next fall.In other words, physicists now believe that the most fundamental laws ofphysics, the conservation laws and invariance principles, are based upon thosefoundations of our reality that are so basic that they go unnoticed. This doesnot mean (probably) that it has taken physicists three hundred years to realizethat moving an object, like a telephone, around the country does not distort itsshape or size (space is homogeneous), nor does turning it upside down (space isisotropic), nor does letting it get two weeks older (time is homogeneous).Everyone knows that this is the way our physical world is constructed. Where andwhen a subatomic experiment is performed are not critical data. The laws ofphysics do not change with time and place.It does mean, however, that it has taken physicists three hundred years torealize that the most simple and beautiful mathematical structures may be thosethat are based on these unobtrusively obvious conditions. Theoretical physics, roughly speaking, has branched into two schools. One schoolfollows the old way of thinking and the other school follows new ways ofthinking. Physicists who follow the old way of thinking continue their searchfor the elementary building blocks of the universe in spite of thehall-of-mirrors predicament.For these physicists, the most likely candidate at present for the title of“ultimate building block of the universe” is the quark. A quark is a type ofhypothetical particle theorized by Murray Gell-Mann in 1964. It is named after aword in James Joyce’s book Finnegans Wake.All known particles, the theory goes, are composed of various combinations of afew (twelve) different types of quarks. The great quark hunt could become veryexciting, but no matter what is discovered, one thing about it already iscertain: The discovery of quarks will open an entirely new area of research,namely, “What are quarks made of?”The physicists who follow the new ways of thinking are pursuing so manydifferent approaches to understanding subatomic phenomena that it is notpossible to present them all. Some of these physicists feel that space and timeare all that there is. According to this theory, actors, action, and stage areall manifestations of an underlying four-dimensional geometry. Others (likeDavid Finkelstein) are exploring processes which lie “beneath time,” processesfrom which space and time, the very fabric of experiential reality, are derived.These theories, at the moment, are speculative. They cannot be “proven”(demonstrated mathematically).The most successful departure from the unending search-for-the-ultimate-particlesyndrome is the S-Matrix theory. In S-Matrix theory, the dance rather than thedancers is of primary importance. S-Matrix theory is different because it placesthe emphasis upon interactions rather than upon particles.“S Matrix” is short for Scattering Matrix. Scattering is what happens toparticles when they collide. A matrix is a type of mathematical table. An SMatrix is a table of probabilities.When subatomic particles collide several things usually are possible. Forexample, the collision of two protons can create (1) a proton, a neutron, and apositive pion, (2) a proton, a lambda particle, and a positive kaon, (3) twoprotons and six assorted pions, (4) numerous other combinations of subatomicparticles. Each of these possible combinations (which are the combinations thatdo not violate the conservation laws) occurs with a certain probability. Inother words, some of them occur more often than others. The probabilities ofvarious combinations in turn depend upon such things as how much momentum iscarried into the collision area.In an S Matrix all of these probabilities are tabulated in such a way that wecan look up or calculate the possible results of any collision along with theirprobabilities if we know what particles initially collide and how much momentumthey have. Of course, there are so many possible combinations of particles (eachone of which can yield a variety of results) that a complete matrix (table)containing all the probabilities of all the possible combinations of particleswould be enormous. In fact, such a complete table has not been compiled. This isno immediate problem, however, since physicists are concerned only with a smallpart of the S Matrix at any one time (for example, the part which deals withtwo-proton collisions). Such parts of the total S Matrix are called elements ofthe S Matrix. The major limitation of S-Matrix theory is that at present itapplies only to the strongly interacting particles (mesons and baryons), which,as a group, are called hadrons (hay’drons).On the next page is an S-Matrix diagram of a subatomic interaction. It is verysimple. The collision area is the circle. Particles 1 and 2 go into thecollision area and particles 3 and 4 come out of the collision area. The diagramtells nothing about what happened at the point of collision. It shows only whatparticles went into the interaction and what particles came out of theinteraction.An S-Matrix diagram is not a space-time diagram. It does not show the positionof the particles in space or time. This is intentional because we do not knowthe exact positions of the interacting particles. We have chosen to measuretheir momenta and consequently their position is unknown (the Heisenberguncertainty principle). For this reason, S-Matrix diagrams indicate only that aninteraction took place in a certain area (inside the circle). They are purelysymbolic representations of particle interactions.image [Images/274.jpg]Not all interactions involve only two initial particles and two final particles.Below are some other forms that an S-Matrix diagram can take.image [Images/275a.jpg]Like Feynman diagrams, S-Matrix diagrams can be rotated. The direction of thearrowheads distinguishes the particles from the anti-particles. Here is anS-Matrix diagram of a proton colliding with a negative pion to produce a protonand a negative pion.image [Images/275b.jpg]When this diagram is rotated it becomes a diagram of a proton/anti-protonannihilation producing a negative pion and a positive pion. (The positive pionis the anti-particle of the negative pion in the original reaction.)image [Images/276.jpg]Every time a diagram is rotated it depicts another possible interaction. Thisparticular S-Matrix diagram can be rotated four times. All of the particles thatcan be depicted by rotating a single element of the S Matrix are intimatelyrelated to each other. In fact, all of the particles represented in an S-Matrixdiagram (including those discovered by rotating the diagram) are defined interms of each other. Which of them are “elementary” is a meaningless question.Since the particles resulting from an interaction often become involved in otherinteractions, separate elements of the S Matrix can be assembleddiagrammatically into a network of related interactions. Each network, as wellas each interaction, is associated with a certain probability. Theseprobabilities can be calculated.image [Images/277a.jpg]According to S-Matrix theory, “particles” are intermediate states in a networkof interactions. The lines in an S-Matrix diagram are not the world lines ofdifferent particles. Lines in an S-Matrix diagram of an interaction network are“reaction channels” through which energy flows. A “neutron,” for example, is areaction channel. It can be formed by a proton and a negative pion.image [Images/277b.jpg]If more energy is available, however, the same channel can be created by alambda particle and a neutral kaon, and several other particle combinations aswell.image [Images/278.jpg]In short, S-Matrix theory is based upon events, not upon things.*[footnote93.html#fn93], † [footnote94.html#fn94] Dancers no longer stand apartas significant entities. In fact, the dancers are not even defined except interms of each other. In S-Matrix theory there is only the dance. We have come a long way from Newton and his proverbial apple. Nonetheless,apples are a real part of the apparent world. When we eat an apple we are awareof who is eating and what is being eaten as distinct from the action of eating.The idea that objects exist apart from event is part of the epistemological netwith which we snare our particular form of experience. This idea is dear to usbecause we have accepted it, without question, as the basis of our reality. Itprofoundly influences how we see ourselves. It is the root of our inescapablesense of separateness from others and environment.The history of scientific thought, if it teaches us anything at all, teaches usthe folly of clutching ideas too closely. To this extent it is an echo ofeastern wisdom which teaches us the folly of clutching anything.image [Images/280.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"PART ONEENLIGHTENMENT [dancingwulimastersthe_con01.html#pt_06]"},{"pageContent":"1MORE THAN BOTH [dancingwulimastersthe_con01.html#ch_11]What does physics have in common with enlightenment? Physics and enlightenmentapparently belong to two realms which are forever separate. One of them(physics) belongs to the external world of physical phenomena and the other ofthem (enlightenment) belongs to the internal world of perceptions. A closerexamination, however, reveals that physics and enlightenment are not soincongruous as we might think. First, there is the fact that only through ourperceptions can we observe physical phenomena. In addition to this obviousbridge, however, there are more intrinsic similarities.Enlightenment entails casting off the bonds of concept (“veils of ignorance”) inorder to perceive directly the inexpressible nature of undifferentiated reality.“Undifferentiated reality” is the same reality that we are a part of now, andalways have been a part of, and always will be a part of. The difference is thatwe do not look at it in the same way as an enlightened being. As everyoneknows(?), words only represent (re-present) something else. They are not realthings. They are only symbols. According to the philosophy of enlightenment,everything (everything) is a symbol. The reality of symbols is an illusoryreality. Nonetheless, it is the one in which we live.Although undifferentiated reality is inexpressible, we can talk around it (usingmore symbols). The physical world, as it appears to the unenlightened, consistsof many separate parts. These separate parts, however, are not really separate.According to mystics from around the world, each moment of enlightenment(grace/insight/samadhi/satori) reveals that everything—all the separate parts ofthe universe—are manifestations of the same whole. There is only one reality,and it is whole and unified. It is one.We already have learned that understanding quantum physics requires amodification of ordinary conceptions (like the idea that something cannot be awave and a particle). Now we shall see that physics may require a more completealteration of our thought processes than we ever conceived or, in fact, than weever could conceive. Likewise we previously have seen that quantum phenomenaseem to make decisions, to “know” what is happening elsewhere. Now we shall seehow quantum phenomena may be connected so intimately that things once dismissedas “occult” could become topics of serious consideration among physicists.In short, both in the need to cast off ordinary thought processes (andultimately to go “beyond thought” altogether), and in the perception of realityas one unity, the phenomenon of enlightenment and the science of physics havemuch in common. Enlightenment is a state of being. Like all states of being it is indescribable.It is a common misconception (literally) to mistake the description of a stateof being for the state itself. For example, try to describe happiness. It isimpossible. We can talk around it, we can describe the perspectives and actionsthat usually accompany a state of happiness, but we cannot describe happinessitself. Happiness and the description of happiness are two different things.Happiness is a state of being. That means that it exists in the realm of directexperience. It is the intimate perception of emotions and sensations which,indescribable in themselves, constitute the state of happiness. The word“happiness” is the label, or symbol, which we pin on this indescribable state.“Happiness” belongs to the realm of abstractions, or concepts. A state of beingis an experience. A description of a state of being is a symbol. Symbols andexperience do not follow the same rules.This discovery, that symbols and experience do not follow the same rules, hascome to the science of physics under the formidable title of quantum logic. Thepossibility that separate parts of reality (like you and I and tugboats) may beconnected in ways which both our common experience and the laws of physicsbelie, has found its way into physics under the name of Bell’s theorem. Bell’stheorem and quantum logic take us to the farthest edges of theoretical physics.Many physicists have not even heard of them.Bell’s theorem and quantum logic (currently) are unrelated. Proponents of oneseldom are interested in the other. Nonetheless, they have much in common. Theyare what is really new in physics. Of course, laser fusion (fusing atoms withhigh-energy light beams) and the search for quarks generally are considered tobe the frontiers of theoretical physics.* [footnote95.html#fn95] In a certainsense, they are. However, there is a big difference between these projects andBell’s theorem and quantum logic.Laser fusion research and the great quark hunt are endeavors within the existingparadigms of physics. A paradigm is an established thought process, a framework.Both quantum logic and Bell’s theorem are potentially explosive in terms ofexisting frameworks. The first (quantum logic) calls us back from the realm ofsymbols to the realm of experience. The second (Bell’s theorem) tells us thatthere is no such thing as “separate parts.” All of the “parts” of the universeare connected in an intimate and immediate way previously claimed only bymystics and other scientifically objectionable people. The central mathematical element in quantum theory, the hero of the story, isthe wave function. The wave function is that mathematical entity which allows usto determine the possible results of an interaction between an observed systemand an observing system. The celebrated position held by the wave function isdue not only to Erwin Schrödinger, who discovered it, but also to the Hungarianmathematician John von Neumann.In 1932, von Neumann published a famous mathematical analysis of quantum theorycalled The Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics.1 In this book vonNeumann, in effect, asked the question, “If a ‘wave function,’ this purelyabstract mathematical creation, actually should describe something in the realworld, what would that something be like?” The answer that he deduced is exactlythe description of a wave function that we already have discussed.This strange animal constantly would change with the passage of time. Eachmoment it would be different than the moment before. It would be a composite ofall the possibilities of the observed system which it describes. It would not bea simple mixture of possibilities, it would be a sort of organic whole whoseparts are changing constantly but which, nonetheless, is somehow athing-in-itself.This thing-in-itself would continue to develop indefinitely until an observation(measurement) is made on the observed system which it represents. If the“observed system” is a photon “propagating in isolation,” the wave functionrepresenting this photon would contain all of the possible results of thephoton’s interaction with a measuring device, like a photographic plate.*[footnote96.html#fn96] (For example, the possibilities contained in the wavefunction might be that the photon will be detected in area A of the photographicplate, that the photon will be detected in area B of the photographic plate, andthat the photon will be detected in area C of the photographic plate.)Once the photon is set in motion the wave function associated with it wouldcontinue to develop (change) according to a causal law (the Schrödinger waveequation) until the photon interacts with the observing system. At that instant,one of the possibilities contained in the wave function would actualize and theother possibilities contained in the wave function would cease to exist. Theysimply would disappear. The wave function, that strange animal that von Neumannwas attempting to describe, would “collapse.” The collapse of this particularwave function would mean that the probability of one of the possible results ofthe photon-measuring-device interaction became one (it happened) and theprobability of the other possibilities became zero (they were no longerpossible). After all, a photon can be detected only in one place at a time.The wave function, according to this view, is not quite a thing yet it is morethan an idea. It occupies that strange middle ground between idea and reality,where all things are possible but none are actual. Heisenberg likened it toAristotle’s potential.This approach has unconsciously shaped the language, and therefore the thinking,of most physicists, even those who consider the wave function to be amathematical fiction, an abstract creation whose manipulation somehow yields theprobabilities of real events which happen in real (versus mathematical) spaceand time.Needless to say, this approach also has caused a great deal of confusion, whichis as unclear today as it was in von Neumann’s time. For example, exactly whendoes the wave function collapse? (The Problem of Measurement.) Is it when thephoton strikes the photographic plate? Is it when the photographic plate isdeveloped? Is it when we look at the developed plate? Exactly what is it thatcollapses? Where does the wave function live before it collapses? and so on.This view of the wave function, that it can be described as a real thing, isgenerally the view of the wave function attributed to von Neumann. However, thereal-wave-function description is only one of two approaches to understandingquantum phenomena which he discussed in The Mathematical Foundations of QuantumMechanics.The second approach, to which von Neumann devoted much less time, is are-examination of the language by which it is necessary to express quantumphenomena. In the section “Projections as Propositions,” he wrote:…the relation between the properties of a physical system on the one hand, andthe projections [wave function] on the other, makes possible a sort of logicalcalculus with these. However, in contrast to the concepts of ordinary logic,this system is extended by the concepts of “simultaneous decidability” [theuncertainty principle] which is characteristic for quantum mechanics.2This suggestion, that the novel properties of quantum theory can be used toconstruct a “logical calculus” which is “in contrast to the concepts of ordinarylogic,” is what von Neumann considered the alternative to describing wavefunctions as real things.Most physicists, however, have adopted a third explanation of wave functions.They dismiss them as purely mathematical constructions, abstract fictions whichrepresent nothing in the world of reality. Unfortunately, this explanationleaves forever unanswered the question, “How, then, can wave functions predictso accurately probabilities which can be verified through actual experience?” Infact, how can wave functions predict anything when they are defined ascompletely unrelated to physical reality. This is a scientific version of thephilosophical question, “How can mind influence matter?”Von Neumann’s second approach to understanding the paradoxical puzzles ofquantum phenomena took him far beyond the boundaries of physics. This brief workpointed to a fusion of ontology, epistemology, and psychology which only now isbeginning to emerge. In short, the problem, said von Neumann, is in thelanguage. Herein lies the germ of what was to become quantum logic.In pointing to the problem of language, von Neumann put his finger on why it isso difficult to answer the question, “What is quantum mechanics?” Mechanics isthe study of motion. Therefore, quantum mechanics is the study of the motion ofquanta—but what are quanta? According to the dictionary, a quantum is a quantityof something. The question is, a quantity of what?A quantum is a piece of action (a piece of the action?). The problem is that aquantum can be like a wave, and then again it can be like a particle, which iseverything that a wave isn’t. Furthermore, when a quantum is like a particle, itis not like a particle in the ordinary sense of the word. A subatomic “particle”is not a “thing.” (We cannot determine simultaneously its position andmomentum.) A subatomic “particle” (quantum) is a set of relationships, or anintermediate state. It can be broken up, but out of the breaking come moreparticles as elementary as the original. “…Those who are not shocked when theyfirst come across quantum theory,” said Niels Bohr, “cannot possibly haveunderstood it.”3Quantum theory is not difficult to explain because it is complicated. Quantumtheory is difficult to explain because the words which we must use tocommunicate it are not adequate for explaining quantum phenomena. This was wellknown and much discussed by the founders of quantum theory. Max Born, forexample, wrote:The ultimate origin of the difficulty lies in the fact (or philosophicalprinciple) that we are compelled to use words of common language when we wish todescribe a phenomenon, not by logical or mathematical analysis, but by a pictureappealing to the imagination. Common language has grown by everyday experienceand can never surpass these limits. Classical physics has restricted itself tothe use of concepts of this kind; by analyzing visible motions it has developedtwo ways of representing them by elementary processes: moving particles andwaves. There is no other way of giving a pictorial description of motions—wehave to apply it even in the region of atomic process, where classical physicsbreak down.4This is the view currently held by most physicists: We encounter problemsexplaining subatomic phenomena when we try to visualize them. Therefore, it isnecessary to forgo explanations in terms of “common language” and restrictourselves to “mathematical analysis.” To learn the physics of subatomicphenomena we first must learn mathematics.“Not so!” says David Finkelstein, Director of the School of Physics at theGeorgia Institute of Technology. Mathematics, like English, also is a language.It is constructed of symbols. “The best you can get with symbols is a maximalbut incomplete description.”5 A mathematical analysis of subatomic phenomena isno better qualitatively than any other symbolic analysis, because symbols do notfollow the same rules as experience. They follow rules of their own. In short,the problem is not in the language, the problem is the language. The difference between experience and symbol is the difference between mythosand logos. Logos imitates, but can never replace, experience. It is a substitutefor experience. Logos is the artificial construction of dead symbols whichmimics experience on a one-to-one basis. Classical physical theory is an exampleof a one-to-one correspondence between theory and reality.Einstein argued that no physical theory is complete unless every element in thereal world has a definite counterpart in the theory. Einstein’s theory ofrelativity is the last great classical theory (even though it is a part of thenew physics) because it is structured in a one-to-one way with phenomena. Unlessa physical theory has one-to-one correspondence with phenomena, argued Einstein,it is not complete.Whatever the meaning assigned to the term complete, the following requirementfor a complete theory seems to be a necessary one: every element of the physicalreality must have a counterpart in the physical theory.6 [Italics in theoriginal.]Quantum theory does not have this one-to-one correspondence between theory andreality (it cannot predict individual events—only probabilities). According toquantum theory, individual events are chance happenings. There are notheoretical elements in quantum theory to correspond with each individual eventthat actually happens. Therefore quantum theory, according to Einstein, isincomplete. This was a basic issue of the famous Bohr-Einstein debates.Mythos points toward experience, but it does not replace experience. Mythos isthe opposite of intellectualism. Ceremonial chants at primitive rituals (likefootball games) are good examples of mythos. They endow experience with value,originality, and vitality, but they do not seek to replace it.Theologically speaking, logos is the original sin, the eating of the fruit ofknowledge, the expulsion from the Garden of Eden. Historically speaking, logosis the growth of the literary revolution, the birth of the written tradition outof the oral tradition. From any point of view, logos (literally) is a deadletter. “Knowledge,” wrote e. e. cummings, “is a polite word for / dead but notburied imagination.” He was talking about logos.Our problem, according to Finkelstein, is that we cannot understand subatomicphenomena, or any other kind of experience, through the use of symbols alone. AsHeisenberg observed:The concepts initially formed by abstraction from particular situations orexperiential complexes acquire a life of their own.7 [Italics added].Getting lost in the interaction of symbols is analogous to mistaking the shadowson the wall of the cave for the real world outside the cave (which is directexperience). The answer to this predicament is to approach subatomic phenomena,as well as experience in general, with a language of mythos rather than alanguage of logos.Finkelstein put it this way:If you want to envision a quantum as a dot then you are trapped. You aremodeling it with classical logic. The whole point is that there is no classicalrepresentation for it. We have to learn to live with the experience.Question: How do you communicate the experience?Answer: You don’t. But by telling how you make quanta and how you measure them,you enable others to have it.8According to Finkelstein, a language of mythos, a language which alludes toexperience but does not attempt to replace it or to mold our perception of it isthe true language of physics. This is because not only the language that we useto communicate our daily experience, but also mathematics, follows a certain setof rules (classical logic). Experience itself is not bound by these rules.Experience follows a much more permissive set of rules (quantum logic). Quantumlogic is not only more exciting than classical logic, it is more real. It isbased not upon the way that we think of things, but upon the way that weexperience them. When we try to describe experience with classical logic (which is what we havebeen doing since we learned to write), we put on a set of blinders, so to speak,which not only restricts our field of vision, but also distorts it. Theseblinders are the set of rules known as classical logic. The rules of classicallogic are well defined. They are simple. The only problem is that they do notcorrespond to experience.The most important difference between the rules of classical logic and the rulesof quantum logic involves the law of distributivity. The law of distributivity,or the distributive law, says that “A, and B or C” is the same as “A and B, or Aand C.” In other words, “I flip a coin and it comes up heads or tails” has thesame meaning as “I flip a coin and it comes up heads, or I flip a coin and itcomes up tails.” The distributive law, which is a foundation of classical logic,does not apply to quantum logic. This is one of the most important but leastunderstood aspects of von Neumann’s work. In 1936, von Neumann and hiscolleague, Garrett Birkhoff, published a paper which laid the foundations ofquantum logic.9In it they used an example of a familiar (to physicists) phenomenon to disprovethe distributive law. By so doing they demonstrated mathematically that it isimpossible to describe experience (including subatomic phenomena) with classicallogic, because the real world follows different rules. The rules that experiencefollows they called quantum logic. The rules which symbols follow they calledclassical logic.Finkelstein uses a version of Birkhoff and von Neumann’s example to disprove thelaw of distributivity. Finkelstein’s demonstration requires only three pieces ofplastic. These three pieces of plastic are contained in the envelope attached tothe back cover of this book. Remove them from their envelope now and examinethem.* [footnote97.html#fn97] Notice that they are transparent and tinted aboutthe color of sunglasses. In fact, pieces of plastic just like these but thickerare used for sunglasses. They are very effective in reducing glare because oftheir particular characteristics. These pieces of plastic are called polarizersand, of course, the sunglasses which use them are called polaroid sunglasses.Polarizers are a special kind of light filter. Most frequently they are made ofstretched sheets of plastic material in which all the molecules are elongatedand aligned in the same direction. Under magnification the molecules looksomething like this.image [Images/293.jpg]These long, slender molecules are responsible for the polarization of the lightwhich passes through them.The polarization of light can be understood most easily as a wave phenomenon.Light waves from an ordinary light source, like the sun, emanate in everyfashion, vertically, horizontally, and every way in between. This does not meanonly that light radiates from a source in all directions. It means that in anygiven beam of light some of the light waves are vertical, some of the lightwaves are horizontal, some are diagonal, and so forth. To a light wave, apolarizer looks something like a picket fence. Whether it can get through thefence or not depends upon whether it is aligned with the fence or not. If thepolarizer is aligned vertically, only the vertical light waves make it through.All of the other light waves are obstructed. All of the light waves that passthrough a vertical polarizer are aligned vertically. This light is calledvertically polarized light.image [Images/294.jpg]If the polarizer is aligned horizontally, only the horizontal light waves makeit through. All of the other light waves are obstructed (first illustration,next page). All of the light waves that pass through a horizontal polarizer arealigned horizontally. This light is called horizontally polarized light.No matter how the polarizer is aligned, all of the light waves passing throughit are aligned in the same plane. The arrows on the polarizers indicate thedirection in which the light passing through them is polarized (which way themolecules in the plastic are elongated).image [Images/295a.jpg]Take one of the polarizers and hold it with the arrow pointing up (or down). Thelight coming through this polarizer now is polarized vertically. Now takeanother polarizer and hold it behind the first polarizer with its arrow alsopointing up (or down). Notice that, except for a slight attenuation due to thetint, all of the light that gets through the first polarizer also gets throughthe second polarizer.image [Images/295b.jpg]Now rotate one of the polarizers from vertical to horizontal. As it is rotated,notice that less and less light gets through the pair. When one of thepolarizers is vertical and the other polarizer is horizontal, no light getsthrough them at all. The first polarizer eliminates all but the horizontallypolarized light waves. They are eliminated by the second polarizer, which passesonly vertically polarized light. The result is that no light passes both thevertical and the horizontal polarizer. It does not matter whether the firstpolarizer is vertical and the second polarizer is horizontal or the other wayround. The order of the filters is not important. In either case, no lightpasses through them.image [Images/296a.jpg]Whenever two polarizers are oriented at right angles to each other they blockall light. No matter how the pair is twisted or turned as a unit, as long asthey remain at right angles to each other, no light passes through them.With this in mind, we come now to the third filter. Align the third filter sothat it polarizes light diagonally and place it in front of the horizontalpolarizer and the vertical polarizer. Nothing happens. If the first two filters(the horizontal and the vertical polarizer) block all the light, the addition ofa third filter, of course, scarcely can affect the situation.image [Images/296b.jpg]In a similar manner, if we place the diagonal polarizer on the other side of thehorizontal-vertical combination, nothing happens. No light gets through thefilters.image [Images/297a.jpg]Now we come to the interesting part. Put the diagonal polarizer between thehorizontal polarizer and the vertical polarizer. Light gets through the threefilters when cut off!image [Images/297b.jpg]In other words, a combination of horizontal and vertical polarizers is as much abarrier to light waves as a wooden door. A diagonal polarizer in front of orbehind such a combination does not affect this phenomenon. However, if adiagonal polarizer is sandwiched in between the horizontal polarizer and thevertical polarizer, light gets through all three of them. Remove the diagonalpolarizer and the light disappears again. It is blocked by the combination ofhorizontal and vertical polarizers.Diagrammatically, the situation looks like this:image [Images/298.jpg]How can this happen? According to quantum mechanics, diagonally polarized lightis not a mixture of horizontally polarized light and vertically polarized light.We cannot simply say that the horizontal components of the diagonally polarizedlight passed through the horizontal polarizer and the vertical components of thediagonally polarized light passed through the vertical polarizer. According toquantum mechanics, diagonally polarized light is a separate thing-in-itself. Howcan a separate thing-in-itself get through all three filters but not through twoof them?If we consider light as a particle phenomenon, this paradox becomes graphic.Namely, how can one photon be broken down into a horizontally polarizedcomponent and a vertically polarized component? (By definition, it can’t.)This paradox is at the heart of the difference between quantum logic andclassical logic. It is caused by our thought processes which are following therules of classical logic. Our intellect tells us that what we are seeing isimpossible (after all, a single photon must be polarized one way or the other).Nonetheless, whenever we insert a diagonal polarizer between a horizontalpolarizer and a vertical polarizer, we see light where there was none before.Our eyes are ignorant of the fact that what they are seeing is “impossible.”That is because experience does not follow the rules of classical logic. Itfollows the rules of quantum logic. The thing-in-itselfness of diagonally polarized light reflects the true natureof experience. Our symbolic thought process imposes upon us the categories of“either-or.” It confronts us always with either this or that, or a mixture ofthis and that. It says that polarized light is either vertically polarized orhorizontally polarized or a mixture of vertically and horizontally polarizedlight. Thus are the rules of classical logic, the rules of symbols. In the realmof experience, nothing is either this or that. There is always at least one morealternative, and often an unlimited number of them.Finkelstein put it this way in reference to quantum theory:There are no waves in the game. The equation that the game obeys is a waveequation, but there are no waves running around. (This is one of the mountainsof quantum mechanics.) There are no particles running around either. What’srunning around are quanta, the third alternative.10To be less abstract, imagine that we have two different pieces from a chess set,say a bishop and a pawn. If these macroscopic chess pieces followed the samerules as quantum phenomena, we would not be able to say that there is nothingbetween being either a bishop or a pawn. Between the extremes of “bishop” and“pawn” is a creature called a “bishawn.” A “bishawn” is neither a bishop nor apawn nor is it half a bishop and half a pawn glued together. A “bishawn” is aseparate thing-in-itself. It cannot be separated into its pawn component and itsbishop component any more than a puppy which is half collie and half Germanshepherd can be separated into its collie “component” and its German shepherd“component.”There is more than one type of “bishawn” between the extremes of bishop andpawn. The bishawn that we have been describing is one-half part bishop andone-half part pawn. Another type of bishawn is one-third part bishop andtwo-thirds part pawn. Still another type of bishawn is three-fourths part bishopand one-fourth part pawn. In fact, for every possible proportion of parts bishopto parts pawn there exists a bishawn which is quite distinct from all theothers.A “bishawn” is what physicists call a coherent superposition. A “superposition”is one thing (or more) imposed on another. A double exposure, the bane ofcareless photographers, is a superposition of one photograph on another. Acoherent superposition, however, is not simply the superposition of one thing onanother. A coherent superposition is a thing-in-itself which is as distinct fromits components as its components are from each other.Diagonally polarized light is a coherent superposition of horizontally polarizedlight and vertically polarized light. Quantum physics abounds with coherentsuperpositions. In fact, coherent superpositions are at the heart of themathematics of quantum mechanics. Wave functions are coherent superpositions.Every quantum mechanical experiment has an observed system. Every observedsystem has an associated wave function. The wave function of a particularobserved system (like a photon) is the coherent superposition of all thepossible results of an interaction between the observed system and a measuringsystem (like a photographic plate). The development in time of this coherentsuperposition of possibilities is described by Schrödinger’s wave equation.Using this equation, we can calculate the form of this thing-in-itself, thiscoherent superposition of possibilities which we call a wave function, for anygiven time. Having done that, we then can calculate the probability of eachpossibility contained in the wave function at that particular time. This givesus a probability function, which is not the same as a wave function, but iscalculated from a wave function. In a nutshell, that is the mathematics ofquantum physics.In other words, in the mathematical formulations of quantum theory nothing iseither “this” or “that” with nothing in between. Graduate students in physicsroutinely learn the mathematical technique of superimposing every “this” onevery “that” in such a way that the result is neither the original “this” northe original “that,” but an entirely new thing called a coherent superpositionof the two.According to Finkelstein, one of the major conceptual difficulties of quantummechanics is the false idea that these wave functions (coherent superpositions)are real things which develop, collapse, etc. On the other hand, the idea thatcoherent superpositions are pure abstractions which represent nothing that weencounter in our daily lives also is incorrect. They reflect the nature ofexperience.How do coherent superpositions reflect experience? Pure experience is neverrestricted to merely two possibilities. Our conceptualization of a givensituation may create the illusion that each dilemma has only two horns, but thisillusion is caused by assuming that experience is bound by the same rules assymbols. In the world of symbols, everything is either this or that. In theworld of experience there are more alternatives available.For example, consider the judge who must try his own son in a court of law. Thelaw allows only two verdicts: “He is guilty” and “He is innocent.” For thejudge, however, there is another possible verdict, namely, “He is my son.” Thefact that we prohibit judges from trying cases in which they have a personalinterest is a tacit admission that experience is not limited to the categoricalalternatives of “guilty” and “innocent” (or “good” and “bad,” etc.). Only in therealm of symbols is the choice so clear.During the Lebanese civil war, a story goes, a visiting American was stopped bya group of masked gunmen. One wrong word could cost him his life.“Are you Christian or Moslem?” they asked.“I am a tourist!” he cried.The way that we pose our questions often illusorily limits our responses. Inthis case, the visitor’s fear for his life broke through this illusion.Similarly, the way that we think our thoughts illusorily limits us to aperspective of either/or. Experience itself is never so limited. There is alwaysan alternative between every “this” and every “that.” The recognition of thisquality of experience is an integral part of quantum logic. Physicists engage in a particular kind of dance which is foreign to most of us.Being around them for any length of time is like entering another culture.Within this culture every statement is subject to the challenge, “Prove it!”When we tell a friend, “I feel great this morning,” we do not expect him to say,“Prove it.” However, when a physicist says, “Experience is not bound by the samerules as symbols,” he invites a chorus of “Prove it’s. Until he can do this, hemust preface his remarks with, “It is my opinion that…” Physicists are not veryimpressed with opinions. Unfortunately, this sometimes makes them narrow-mindedto an extraordinary degree. If you are not willing to follow their dance, theywon’t dance with you.Their dance requires a “proof” for every assertion. A “proof” does not verifythat an assertion is “true” (that that is the way the world really is). Ascientific “proof” is a mathematical demonstration that the assertion inquestion is logically consistent. In the realm of pure mathematics, an assertionmay have no relevance to experience at all. Nonetheless, if it is accompanied bya self-consistent “proof” it is accepted. If it is not, it is rejected. The sameis true of physics except that the science of physics imposes the additionalrequirement that the assertion relate to physical reality.So much for the relationship between the “truth” of a scientific assertion andthe nature of reality. There isn’t any. Scientific “truth” has nothing to dowith “the way that reality really is.” A scientific theory is “true” if it isself-consistent and correctly correlates experience (predicts events). In short,when a scientist says that a theory is true, he means that it correctlycorrelates experience and, therefore, it is useful. If we substitute the word“useful” whenever we encounter the word “true,” physics appears in its properperspective.Birkhoff and von Neumann created a “proof” that experience violates the rules ofclassical logic. This proof, of course, is embedded in experience. Inparticular, it is based upon what does and does not happen with variouscombinations of polarized light. Finkelstein uses a slightly modified version ofBirkhoff and von Neumann’s original proof to demonstrate quantum logic.The first step of this proof is to experiment with all of the possiblecombinations of horizontally, vertically, and diagonally polarized light. Inother words, the first step is to do what we have done already: discover whichlight emissions pass through which polarizers. Observe for yourself that lightpasses through two vertical polarizers, two horizontal polarizers, two diagonalpolarizers, a diagonal and a horizontal polarizer, and a diagonal and a verticalpolarizer. All of these combinations are called “allowed transitions” becausethey actually happen. Similarly, observe for yourself that light does not passthrough a horizontal and a vertical polarizer, or any other combination ofpolarizers oriented at right angles to each other. These combinations are called“forbidden transitions” because they never happen.The second step of the proof is to make a table of this information called atransition table. A transition table looks like this:image [Images/303.jpg]The row of letters on the left are emissions. An emission is just what it soundslike. In this case, an emission is a light wave that is emitted from a lightbulb. The “)” sign to the right of a letter indicates an emission. For example,“H)” means horizontally polarized light emitting from a horizontal polarizer.The row of letters on the top are admissions. An admission is the reception ofan emission. The “)” sign to the left of a letter indicates an admission. Forexample, “)H” means a horizontally polarized light wave reaching an eyeball.The zeros with the lines through them (pronounced “oh”) stand for the “nullprocess.” The null process means that we decided to go to the movies today andnot do the experiment. The null process stands for no emissions, nothing. Theletter “I” stands for “identity process.” The identity process is a filter thatpasses everything. In other words, “I” tells us what kinds of polarized lightpass through, say, an open window: namely, every kind.Two kinds of diagonally polarized light are included in the table to make itcomplete. The “D” represents light diagonally polarized to the left, and the“image [Images/304a.jpg]” represents light diagonally polarized to the right (orthe other way round).image [Images/304b.jpg]To use the transition table we pick the type of emission in which we areinterested and follow it across the table. For example, an emission ofhorizontally polarized light, H), will pass through another horizontalpolarizer, so an “A,” for allowed, is placed in the square where thehorizontally polarized emission line intersects the horizontally polarizedadmission column. Horizontally polarized light also passes through a diagonalpolarizer tilted to the left,)D, a diagonal polarizer tilted to the right,)image[Images/305a.jpg], and an open window, I. An “A” is placed in each appropriatesquare.Notice that the square where the horizontally polarized emission line intersectsthe vertically polarized admission column is blank. This is because horizontallypolarized light does not pass through a vertical polarizer. The blank squaresshow the forbidden transitions. All of the null process squares are blankbecause nothing happens if we don’t do the experiment. All of the “I” squaresare marked “A” because every kind of light, polarized and otherwise, passesthrough an open window.The third step in the proof is to make a simple diagram of the informationcontained in the transition table. The diagram made from this particulartransition table looks like this:image [Images/305b.jpg]This type of diagram is called a lattice. Mathematicians use lattices to showthe ordering of events or elements. Lattices are similar to the genealogicaltrees that we construct when we research our family roots. The higher elementsinclude the lower elements. The lines show who is connected to whom and throughwhom.A lattice is not exactly a family tree, but it shows the same kind of inclusiveordering. At the bottom is the null process. Nothing is below the null processsince the null process represents no emissions of any kind. In the next level upare the various states of polarization. The elements at this level are calledsinglets. Singlets are the simplest statements that we can make about thepolarization of a light wave. “This light is horizontally polarized,” is themost that we can say about the state of polarization, even though it doesn’ttell us anything else. It is a “maximal but incomplete description,” alimitation inherent in the use of language.The next level up contains the doublets. In this lattice there is only onedoublet. Doublets comprise the next level of maximal but incomplete statementsthat we can make about the polarization of light in this simple experiment.Lattices representing more complex phenomena can have considerably morelevels—triplets, quadruplets, etc. This lattice is the simplest of them all, butit graphically demonstrates the nature of quantum logic.First, notice that the doublet, I, contains four singlets. This is typical ofquantum logic but an incomprehensible contradiction to classical logic whereinevery doublet, by definition, contains only two singlets, no more and no less.Lattices are graphic demonstrations of the quantum postulate that there isalways at least one alternative between every “this” and every “that.” In thiscase, two alternatives (“D” and “image [Images/306a.jpg]”) are represented.There are many more available alternatives that are not represented in thislattice. For example, the light in the lattice represented by the symbol image[Images/306b.jpg] is diagonally polarized at 45°, but we also can polarize lightat 46°, 47°, 48½°, etc., and all of these states of polarization could beincluded in the doublet, I.In both classical logic and quantum logic a singlet can be represented by a dot.In classical logic a doublet is represented by two dots. In quantum logic,however, a doublet is represented by a line drawn between the two dots. All ofthe points on the line are included in the doublet—not only the two points thatdefine it.image [Images/307a.jpg]Now let us return to the distributive law: “A, and B or C” equals “A and B, or Aand C.” (The whole purpose of making a transition table was to make a lattice touse in disproving the distributive law.)Mathematicians use lattice diagrams to determine which elements in the latticeare connected and in what way.image [Images/307b.jpg]For example, to see how two elements in the lattice are connected by the word“and,” follow the lines leading from the elements in question down to a pointwhere they both meet (which mathematicians call the “greatest lower bound”). Ifwe are interested in “H and D,” we follow the lines downward from H and from Dand find that they meet at ø. Therefore, the lattice tells us that “H and D”equals “ø.” If we are interested in “I and H,” we follow the line downward fromthe highest starting point on the lattice (I) and find that the lowest commonpoint of I and H is H. Therefore, the lattice tells us that “I and H” equals“H.”To see how two elements in the lattice are connected by the word “or,” followthe lines leading from the elements in question up to a point where they bothmeet (which mathematicians call the “least upper bound”). For example, if we areinterested in “H or V,” we follow the lines upward from H and from V and findthat they meet at I. Therefore, the lattice tells us that “H or V” equals “I.”Similarly, to find “D or I,” we follow the lines upward to their highest commonpoint, which is I. Therefore, the lattice tells us that “D or I” equals “I.”The rule is simple: “and” goes down, “or” goes up.Go down the lattice to find “and,” go up the lattice to find “or.”Now we come to the proof itself. The proof itself is considerably simpler thanthe preliminary explanations. The distributive law says that “A, and B or C”equals “A and B, or A and C.” To see whether this is true of experience or notwe simply insert some of our actual states of polarization into the formula andsolve it using the lattice method. For example, the distributive law says that“Horizontally polarized light and vertically polarized light or diagonallypolarized light” equals “Horizontally polarized light and vertically polarizedlight, or horizontally polarized light and diagonally polarized light.” Usingthe abbreviations that we already have used, this is written: “H, and D or V”equals “H and D, or H and V.”Returning to the lattice, let us examine the left side of this statement first.Solving for “D or V,” we follow the lines on the lattice upward from D and fromV to their highest common point (“or” goes up). They meet at I. Therefore, thelattice tells us that “D or V” equals “I.” Substituting “I” for the original “Dor V,” we have left on this side of the statement “H and I.” Following the linesfrom H and from I downward on the lattice (“and” goes down), we find that theirlowest common point is at H. Therefore, the lattice tells us that “H and I”equals “H.”In short:“H, and D or V” equals “H and D, or H and V”“H and I” equals “H and D, or H and V”“H” equals “H and D, or H and V”We solve the right side of this statement in the same way. Solving for “H andD,” we follow the lines on the lattice downward from H and from D to theirlowest common point. They meet at ø. Therefore, the lattice tells us that “H andD” equals “ø.”image [Images/309.jpg]Substituting “ø” for “H and D,” we are left with “ø, or H and V” on the rightside of the statement. To solve for “H and V,” we follow the lines on thelattice downward from H and from V to their lowest common point. They alsointersect at ø. Therefore, the lattice tells us that “H and V” equals “ø.”Substituting “ø” for “H and V” we now are left with “ø or ø” on the right sideof the original statement. Both the lattice and common sense tell us that “ø orø” equals “ø.”In short:“H” equals “H and D, or H and V”“H” equals “ø, or H and V”“H” equals “ø or ø”“H” equals “ø”But “H” does not equal “ø!” “H” is horizontally polarized light and “ø” is anon-experiment—a lack of any emission at all. The distributive law does notwork!Here is Birkhoff and von Neumann’s proof again. It is important because, simpleas it is, it could end an illusion millennia old: the illusion that symbols andexperience follow the same set of rules. Except for the mathematical symbolsthat represent the connectives “and” and “or,” this is exactly the way thatphysicists read it: “H, and D or V” image [Images/neq.jpg] “H and D, or H and V” “H and I” image [Images/neq.jpg] “ø, or H and V” “H” image [Images/neq.jpg] “ø or ø” “H” ≠ “ø” Finkelstein’s theory is a theory of process. Quantum logic is only one part ofit. According to this theory, the basic unit of the universe is an event, or aprocess. These events link in certain ways (allowed transitions) to form webs.The webs in turn join to form larger webs. Farther up the ladder of organizationare coherent superpositions of different webs (things which are neither “thisweb” nor “that web” but distinct entities in themselves).The basic events of Finkelstein’s theory do not exist in space and time. Theyare prior to space and time. According to Finkelstein, space, time, mass, andenergy are secondary qualities which are derived from the basic events of theuniverse. In fact, Finkelstein’s latest paper is called “Beneath Time.”This bold theory is a radical departure from conventional physics and fromconventional thought. The mathematics of Finkelstein’s theory, which is calledquantum topology, is remarkably simple compared to the complex mathematics ofquantum theory and relativity. Quantum topology is as yet incomplete (lacking“proof”). Like many theories, it may never be complete. Unlike most othertheories, however, it contains the potential to alter radically our conceptualframework.Von Neumann’s discovery that our thought processes (the realm of symbols)project illusory restrictions onto the real word is essentially the samediscovery that led Einstein to the general theory of relativity. Einsteindisproved the universality of Euclidean geometry. Until the general theory ofrelativity, Euclidean geometry had been accepted without question as theunderlying structure of the universe. Birkhoff and von Neumann disproved theuniversality of classical logic. Until now, classical logic has been acceptedwithout question as a natural reflection of the nature of reality.A powerful awareness lies dormant in these discoveries: an awareness of thehitherto-unsuspected powers of the mind to mold “reality,” rather than the otherway round. In this sense, the philosophy of physics is becomingindistinguishable from the philosophy of Buddhism, which is the philosophy ofenlightenment."},{"pageContent":"1THE END OF SCIENCE [dancingwulimastersthe_con01.html#ch_12]A vital aspect of the enlightened state is the experience of an all-pervadingunity. “This” and “that” no longer are separate entities. They are differentforms of the same thing. Everything is a manifestation. It is not possible toanswer the question, “Manifestation of what?” because the “what” is that whichis beyond words, beyond concept, beyond form, beyond even space and time.Everything is a manifestation of that which is. That which is, is. Beyond thesewords lies the experience; the experience of that which is.The forms through which that which is manifests itself are each and every one ofthem perfect. We are manifestations of that which is. Everything is amanifestation of that which is. Everything and everybody is exactly andperfectly what it is.A fourteenth-century Tibetan Buddhist, Longchenpa, wrote:Since everything is but an apparitionPerfect in being what it is,Having nothing to do with good or bad,Acceptance or rejection,One may well burst out in laughter.1We might say, “God’s in His heaven and all’s well with the world,” except thataccording to the enlightened view, the world couldn’t be any other way. It isneither well nor not well. It simply is what it is. What it is is perfectly whatit is. It couldn’t be anything else. It is perfect. I am perfect. I am exactlyand perfectly who I am.

If you are a person who is changing, then that is what you perfectlyare—a person who is changing. That which is is that which is. That which is notis that which is. There is nothing which is not that which is. There is nothingother than that which is. Everything is that which is. We are a part of thatwhich is. In fact, we are that which is.If we substitute “subatomic particles” for people in this scheme, we have a goodapproximation of the conceptual dynamics of particle physics. Yet, there isanother sense in which this aspect of unity has entered physics. The pioneers ofquantum physics noticed a strange “connectedness” among quantum phenomena. Untilrecently this oddity lacked any theoretical significance. It was regarded as anaccidental feature which would be explained as the theory developed.In 1964, J. S. Bell, a physicist at the European Organization for NuclearResearch (CERN) in Switzerland, zeroed in on this strange connectedness in amanner that may make it the central focus of physics in the future. Dr. Bellpublished a mathematical proof which came to be known as Bell’s theorem. Bell’stheorem was reworked and refined over the following ten years until it emergedin its present form. Its present form is dramatic, to say the least.Bell’s theorem is a mathematical construct which, as such, is indecipherable tothe nonmathematician. Its implications, however, could affect profoundly ourbasic world view. Some physicists are convinced that it is the most importantsingle work, perhaps, in the history of physics. One of the implications ofBell’s theorem is that, at a deep and fundamental level, the “separate parts” ofthe universe are connected in an intimate and immediate way.In short, Bell’s theorem and the enlightened experience of unity are verycompatible. The unexplained connectedness of quantum phenomena shows itself in several ways.The first way we already have discussed. It is the double-slit experiment. Whenboth slits in a double-slit experiment are open, the light waves going throughthem interfere with each other to form a pattern of alternating light and darkbands on a screen. When only one slit in a double-slit experiment is open, thelight waves going through it illuminate the screen in the ordinary way. How doesa single photon in a double-slit experiment know whether or not it can go to anarea on the screen that must be dark if both slits are open?The great multitude of photons of which a single photon eventually will be apart distributes itself in one way if one slit is open, and in an entirelydifferent way if both slits are open. The question is, assuming that a singlephoton goes through one of the two slits, how does it know whether or not theother slit is open? Somehow it does. An interference pattern always forms whenwe open both slits, and it never forms when we close one of the slits.However, there is another experiment in which this apparent connectedness ofquantum phenomena is even more perplexing. Suppose that we have what physicistscall a two-particle system of zero spin. This means that the spin of each of theparticles in the system cancels the other. If one of the particles in such asystem has a spin up, the other particle has a spin down. If the first particlehas a spin right, the second particle has a spin left. No matter how theparticles are oriented, their spins are always equal and opposite.Now suppose that we separate these two particles in some way that does notaffect their spin (like electrically). One particle goes off in one directionand the other particle goes off in the opposite direction.image [Images/315.jpg]The spin of a subatomic particle can be oriented by a magnetic field. Forexample, if a beam of electrons with randomly oriented spin is sent through aparticular type of magnetic field (called a Stern-Gerlach device), the magneticfield splits the beam into two equal smaller beams. In one of them all of theelectrons have a spin up and in the other all of the electrons have a spin down.If only one electron goes through this magnetic field, it will come out of itwith either a spin up or a spin down. (We can design the experiment so that theodds are 50–50) (first drawing, previous page).If we reorientate the magnetic field (change its axis) we can give all of theelectrons a spin right or a spin left instead of a spin up or a spin down. Ifonly one electron goes through the magnetic field when it is oriented this way,it will come out of it with either a spin right or a spin left (equal chanceeither way) (second drawing, previous page).Now suppose that after we separate our original two-particle system we send oneof the particles through a magnetic field that will give it either a spin up ora spin down. In this case, let us say that the particle comes out of themagnetic field with a spin up. This means that we automatically know that theother particle has a spin down. We do not have to make a measurement on theother particle because we know that its spin is equal to and opposite to that ofits twin.The experiment looks like this:image [Images/316.jpg]The original two-particle system with zero spin is at the center. One of theparticles goes to area A. In area A it goes through a Stern-Gerlach device. Inthis case, the Stern-Gerlach device gives it a spin up. Therefore, we knowwithout measuring that the other particle, which has gone to area B, has a spindown.Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen thought up this experienceover forty-five years ago. Actually, this version of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosenexperiment (using spin states) was thought up by David Bohm, a physicist at theUniversity of London. This version usually is used to illustrate theEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen effect. (The original paper dealt with positions andmomenta.)In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen published their thought experiment in apaper entitled, “Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality BeConsidered Complete?”2 At that time, Bohr, Heisenberg, and the proponents of theCopenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics were saying that quantum theoryis a complete theory even though it doesn’t provide any picture of the worldseparate from our observations of it. (They’re still saying it.) The messagethat Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen wanted to convey to their colleagues was thatthe quantum theory is not a “complete” theory because it does not describecertain important aspects of reality which are physically real even if they arenot observed. The message that their colleagues got, however, was quitedifferent. The message that their colleagues got was that the particles in theEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen thought experiment somehow are connected in a way thattranscends our usual ideas about causality.For example, if the axis of the Stern-Gerlach device in our hypotheticalexperiment were changed to make the particles spin right or left instead of upor down, the experiment would look like this:image [Images/317.jpg]The particle in area A would have a spin right instead of a spin up. This meansthat the particle in area B would have a spin left instead of a spin down. Itsspin is always equal and opposite that of its twin.Now suppose that the axis of the Stern-Gerlach device is changed while theparticles are in flight. Somehow the particle traveling in area B “knows” thatits twin in area A is spinning right instead of up and so it spins left insteadof down. In other words, what we did in area A (changed the axis of the magneticfield) affected what happened in area B. This strange phenomenon is known as theEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) effect.Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen’s thought experiment is the Pandora’s Box ofmodern physics. It inadvertently illustrated an unexplainable connectednessbetween particles in two different places. The particle in area B seems to knowinstantaneously the spin status of the particle in area A.*[footnote98.html#fn98] This connectedness allows an experimenter in one place(area A) to affect the state of a system in another place (area B).“It is rather discomforting,” remarked Erwin Schrödinger, in reference to thisphenomenon,that the [quantum] theory should allow a system to be steered or piloted intoone or the other type of state at the experimenter’s mercy in spite of hishaving no access to it.3At once physicists realized that this peculiar situation raises a criticalquestion: “How can two of anything communicate so quickly?”According to the usual ideas in physics, information is carried from one placeto another by a signal. Without a carrier there is no communication. Forexample, the most common form of communication is talking. The information thatwe convey by talking is carried (in a face-to-face conversation) by sound waves.Sound waves only travel so fast (about 700 miles per hour). Therefore, how longit takes my information to get from me to you depends upon how far away from meyou are. The fastest communication signal is an electromagnetic wave, like alight wave or a radio wave. These travel at approximately 186,000 miles persecond. Almost all of physics rests upon the assumption that nothing in theuniverse can travel faster than the speed of light.* [footnote99.html#fn99] Theextraordinarily high velocity of light makes communication by light signal seeminstantaneous. I seem to see you nod your head at the moment that you actuallydo it. Nonetheless, communication by light signal is not instantaneous. How longit takes my information to travel via light signal from me to you depends uponhow far away from me you are. In most instances, the travel time required is sobrief that it scarcely can be measured. It takes several seconds, however, for aradio signal to travel from the earth to the moon and back.Now suppose that area A and area B are very far apart. It will take a certainamount of time for a light signal to travel from area A to area B. If area A andarea B are so far apart that there is insufficient time for a light signal toconnect an event that happens in area A with an event that happens in area B,there is no way, according to the usual ideas in physics, that the event in areaB can know about the event in area A. Physicists call this a “space-like”separation. (One event is space-like separated from another event if there isinsufficient time for a light signal to connect them.) Communication betweenspace-like separated events defies one of the most basic assumptions of physics.Yet this is exactly what the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen thought experiment seems toillustrate. Even though they are space-like separated, the state of the particlein area B depends upon what the observer in area A decides to observe (which wayhe orients his magnetic field).In other words, the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen effect indicates that informationcan be communicated at superluminal (faster than light) speeds contrary to theaccepted ideas of physicists. If the two particles in theEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen thought experiment somehow are connected by a signal,that signal is traveling faster than the speed of light. Einstein, Podolsky, andRosen may have created the first scientific example of a superluminalconnection.Einstein himself denied this conclusion. It is not possible, he argued, that thesetting we choose for a measuring device here can affect what happens somewhereelse. In his autobiography, written eleven years after theEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen paper, he wrote:…on one supposition we should, in my opinion, absolutely hold fast; the realfactual situation of the system S2 [the particle in area B] is independent ofwhat is done with the system S1 [the particle in area A], which is spatiallyseparated from the former.4This opinion is, in effect, the principle of local causes. The principle oflocal causes says that what happens in one area does not depend upon variablessubject to the control of an experimenter in a distant space-like separatedarea. The principle of local causes is common sense. The results of anexperiment in a place distant and space-like separated from us should not dependon what we decide to do or not to do right here. (Except for the mother who rosein alarm at the same instant that her daughter’s distant automobile crashed intoa tree—and similar cases—the macroscopic world appears to be made of localphenomena.)Since phenomena are local in nature, argued Einstein, quantum theory has aserious flaw. According to quantum theory, changing the measuring device in areaA changes the wave function which describes the particle in area B, but(according to Einstein) it cannot change “the real factual situation of thesystem S2 [which] is independent of what is done with the system S1…”Therefore, one and the same “factual situation” in area B has two wavefunctions, one for each position of the measuring device in area A. This is aflaw since it is “impossible that two different types of wave functions could becoordinated with the identical factual situation of S2.”5Here is another way of looking at the same situation: Since the real factualsituation in area B is independent of what is done in area A, there must existsimultaneously in area B a definite spin up or down and a definite spin right orleft to account for all the results that we can get by orienting theStern-Gerlach device in area A either vertically or horizontally. Quantum theoryis not able to describe such a state in area B and, therefore, it is anincomplete theory.* [footnote100.html#fn100]However, Einstein closed his argument with an incredible aside:One can escape from this conclusion [that quantum theory is incomplete] only byeither assuming that the measurement of S1 ((telepathically)) changes the realsituation of S2 or by denying independent real situations as such to thingswhich are spatially separated from each other. Both alternatives appear to meentirely unacceptable.6Although these alternatives were unacceptable to Einstein, they are beingconsidered by physicists today. Few physicists believe in telepathy, but somephysicists do believe either that at a deep and fundamental level there is nosuch thing as “independent real situations” of things which have interacted inthe past but which are spatially separated from each other, or that changing themeasuring device in area A does change “the real factual situation” in area B.This brings us to Bell’s theorem. Bell’s theorem is a mathematical proof. What it “proves” is that if thestatistical predictions of quantum theory are correct, then some of ourcommonsense ideas about the world are profoundly mistaken.Bell’s theorem does not demonstrate clearly in what way our commonsense ideasabout the world are inadequate. There are several possibilities. Eachpossibility has champions among the small number of physicists who are familiarwith Bell’s theorem. No matter which of the implications of Bell’s theorem wefavor, however, Bell’s theorem itself leads to the inescapable conclusion thatif the statistical predictions of quantum theory are correct, then ourcommonsense ideas about the world are profoundly deficient.This is quite a conclusion because the statistical predictions of quantummechanics are always correct. Quantum mechanics is the theory. It has explainedeverything from subatomic particles to transistors to stellar energy. It neverhas failed. It has no competition.Quantum physicists realized in the 1920s that our commonsense ideas wereinadequate for describing subatomic phenomena. Bell’s theorem shows thatcommonsense ideas are inadequate even to describe macroscopic events, events ofthe everyday world!As Henry Stapp wrote:The important thing about Bell’s theorem is that it puts the dilemma posed byquantum phenomena clearly into the realm of macroscopic phenomena…[it] showsthat our ordinary ideas about the world are somehow profoundly deficient even onthe macroscopic level.7Bell’s theorem has been reformulated in several ways since Bell published theoriginal version in 1964. No matter how it is formulated, it projects the“irrational” aspects of subatomic phenomena squarely into the macroscopicdomain. It says that not only do events in the realm of the very small behave inways which are utterly different from our commonsense view of the world, butalso that events in the world at large, the world of freeways and sports cars,behave in ways which are utterly different from our commonsense view of them.This incredible statement cannot be dismissed as fantasy because it is basedupon the awesome and proven accuracy of the quantum theory itself. Bell’s theorem is based upon correlations between paired particles similar tothe pair of hypothetical particles in the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen thoughtexperiment.* [footnote101.html#fn101] For example, imagine a gas that emitslight when it is electrically excited (think of a neon sign). The excited atomsin the gas emit photons in pairs. The photons in each pair fly off in oppositedirections. Except for the difference in their direction of travel, the photonsin each pair are identical twins. If one of them is polarized vertically, theother one also is polarized vertically. If one of the photons in the pair ispolarized horizontally, the other photon also is polarized horizontally. Nomatter what the angle of polarization, both photons in every pair are polarizedin the same plane.Therefore, if we know the state of polarization of one of the particles, weautomatically know the state of polarization of the other particle. Thissituation is similar to the situation in the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen thoughtexperiment, except that now we are discussing states of polarization instead ofspin states.We can verify that both photons in each pair of photons are polarized in thesame plane by actually sending them through polarizers. On the next page is apicture of this (conceptually) simple procedure.image [Images/324.jpg]A light source in the center of the picture emits a pair of photons. On eachside of the light source a polarizer is placed in the path of the emittedphoton. Behind the polarizers are photomultiplier tubes which emit a click (oran audible electronic equivalent) whenever they detect a photon.Whenever the photomultiplier tube in area A emits a click, the photomultipliertube in area B also emits a click. This is because both of the photons in eachphoton pair always are polarized in the same plane, and both of the polarizersin this arrangement are aligned in the same direction (in this case,vertically). There is no theory involved here, just a matter of counting clicks.We know, and can verify, that when the polarizers both are aligned in the samedirection, the photomultiplier tubes behind them will click an equal number oftimes. The clicks in area A are correlated with the clicks in area B. Thecorrelation, in this case, is one. Whenever one of the photomultiplier tubeclicks, the other photomultiplier tube always clicks as well.Now suppose that we orient one of the polarizers at 90 degrees to the other. Onthe next page is a picture of this arrangement. One of the polarizers still isaligned vertically, but the other polarizer now is aligned horizontally. Lightwaves that pass through a vertical polarizer are stopped by a horizontalpolarizer and the other way round. Therefore, when the polarizers are orientedat right angles to each other, a click in area A never will be accompanied by aclick in area B. The clicks in area A, again, are correlated with the clicks inarea B. This time, however, the correlation is zero. Whenever one of thephotomultiplier tubes clicks, the other photomultiplier tube never clicks.image [Images/325.jpg]There also are correlations between the clicks in area A and the clicks in areaB for every other possible combination of polarizer settings between these twoextremes. These statistical correlations can be predicted by the quantum theory.For a given setting of the polarizers, a certain number of clicks in one areawill be accompanied by a certain number of clicks in the other area.Bell discovered that no matter what the settings of the polarizers, the clicksin area A are correlated too strongly to the number of clicks in area B to beexplained by chance. They have to be connected somehow. However, if they areconnected, then the principle of local causes (which says that what happens inone area does not depend upon variables subject to the control of anexperimenter in a distant space-like area) is an illusion! In short, Bell’stheorem shows that the principle of local causes, however reasonable it sounds,is mathematically incompatible with the assumption that the statisticalpredictions of quantum theory are valid (at least valid in this experiment andin the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen experiment).* [footnote102.html#fn102]The correlations which Bell used were calculated, but untested predictions ofthe quantum theory. In 1964, this experiment was still a hypothetical construct.In 1972, John Clauser and Stuart Freedman at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratoryactually performed this experiment to confirm or disprove these predictions.8They found that the statistical predictions upon which Bell based his theoremare correct.Bell’s theorem not only suggests that the world is quite different than itseems, it demands it. There is no question about it. Something very exciting ishappening. Physicists have “proved,” rationally, that our rational ideas aboutthe world in which we live are profoundly deficient.In 1975, Henry Stapp, in a work supported by the U.S. Energy Research andDevelopment Administration, wrote:Bell’s theorem is the most profound discovery of science.9The deduction of superluminal communication from the results of theClauser-Freedman experiment rests upon an important assumption: namely, that thestates of the measuring devices prior to the arrival of the photons in area Aand area B do not matter. This is, after all, a reasonable assumption. Normallywe say that the orientation of a measuring device prior to a measurement is notrelevant to the result that we get at the time of a measurement. The result ofan experiment depends upon the state of the measuring device at the time thatthe particle is detected by it, and not on the state of the measuring devicebefore the particle gets there. However, superluminal communication cannot bededuced from the results of the Clauser-Freedman experiment without thisassumption. Even though the photons in the photon pair cannot exchangeinformation via light signals while they are in flight (each is traveling awayfrom the other at the speed of light), the measuring device in area A and themeasuring device in area B, which are set prior to the beginning of theexperiment, may have exchanged information in the conventional manner (via lightsignals propagating within space-time). In other words, in the Clauser-Freedmanexperiment the information about the setting of the measuring device in eitherregion has sufficient time, traveling at the speed of light or less, to reachthe other region before the particle arrives.In 1982, Alain Aspect, a physicist at the Institute of Optics, University ofParis, in Orsay, France, conducted an experiment which was similar to theClauser-Freedman experiment, but with one important difference: the settings onthe measuring devices in Aspect’s experiment could be changed at the last minute(or, more precisely, at the last microsecond).10 Changing the settings on themeasuring devices at the last minute insures that information about the settingof the measuring device in either area does not have sufficient time, travelingat the speed of light or less, to reach the other region before the particlearrives.* [footnote103.html#fn103] In other words, Aspect, in effect, performedBohm’s thought experiment.Like the Clauser-Freedman experiment (and several Clauser-Freedman-typeexperiments which had been performed in the meanwhile),11 Aspect’s experimentverified the statistical predictions of quantum mechanics. Because Aspect’sexperiment, however, satisfied the conditions upon which the logical analysisleading to the phenomenon of superluminal transfer of information is based (thatarea A and area B are space-like separated) physicists were able to deduce thisphenomenon solely on the basis of Aspect’s experimental results. This lentconsiderable credence to the conclusion which Stapp had reached five yearspreviously. Wrote Stapp:Quantum phenomena provide prima facie evidence that information gets around inways that do not conform to classical ideas. Thus, the idea that information istransferred superluminally is, a priori, not unreasonable.Everything we know about Nature is in accord with the idea that the fundamentalprocess of Nature lies outside space-time…but generates events that can belocated in space-time. The theorem of this paper supports this view of Nature byshowing that superluminal transfer of information is necessary, barring certainalternatives…that seem less reasonable. Indeed, the reasonable philosophicalposition of Bohr seems to lead to the rejection of the other possibilities, andhence, by inference, to the conclusion that superluminal transfer of informationis necessary.12Thus, eighty-two years after Planck presented his quantum hypothesis, physicistshave been forced to consider the possibility, among others, that thesuperluminal transfer of information between space-like separated events may bean integral aspect of our physical reality.* [footnote104.html#fn104], †[footnote105.html#fn105] Bell’s theorem showed that either the statistical predictions of quantum theoryor the principle of local causes is false. It did not say which one is false,but only that both of them cannot be true. When Clauser and Freedman confirmedthat the statistical predictions of quantum theory are correct, the startlingconclusion was inescapable: The principle of local causes must be false!However, if the principle of local causes fails and, hence, the world is not theway it appears to be, then what is the true nature of our world?There are several mutually exclusive possibilities. The first possibility, whichwe have just discussed, is that, appearances to the contrary, there really maybe no such thing as “separate parts” in our world (in the dialect of physics,“locality fails”). In that case, the idea that events are autonomous happeningsis an illusion. This would be the case for any “separate parts” that haveinteracted with each other at any time in the past. When “separate parts”interact with each other, they (their wave functions) become correlated (throughthe exchange of conventional signals) (forces). Unless this correlation isdisrupted by other external forces, the wave functions representing these“separate parts” remain correlated forever.* [footnote106.html#fn106] For suchcorrelated “separate parts,” what an experimenter does in this area has anintrinsic effect upon the results of an experiment in a distant, space-likeseparated area. This possibility entails a faster-than-light communication of atype different than conventional physics can explain.In this picture, what happens here is intimately and immediately connected towhat happens elsewhere in the universe, which, in turn, is intimately andimmediately connected to what happens elsewhere in the universe, and so on,simply because the “separate parts” of the universe are not separate parts.“Parts,” wrote David Bohm:are seen to be in immediate connection, in which their dynamical relationshipsdepend, in an irreducible way, on the state of the whole system (and, indeed, onthat of broader systems in which they are contained, extending ultimately and inprinciple to the entire universe). Thus, one is led to a new notion of unbrokenwholeness which denies the classical idea of analyzability of the world intoseparately and independently existent parts…13According to quantum mechanics, individual events are determined by pure chance.We can calculate, for example, that a certain percentage of spontaneous positivekaon decays will produce an antimuon and a neutrino (63%), a certain percentagewill produce a positive pion and a neutral pion (21%), a certain percentage willproduce two positive pions and a negative pion (5.5%), a certain percentage willproduce a positron, a neutrino, and a neutral pion (4.8%), a certain percentagewill produce an antimuon, a neutrino, and a neutral pion (3.4%), and so on.However, quantum theory cannot predict which decay will produce which result.Individual events, according to quantum mechanics, are completely random.Said another way, the wave function which describes spontaneous kaon decayscontains all of these possible results. When the decay actually happens, one ofthese potentialities is converted into an actuality. Even though the probabilityof each potentiality can be calculated, which potentiality actually happens atthe moment of decay is a matter of chance.Bell’s theorem implies that which decay reaction occurs at a certain time is nota matter of chance. Like everything else, it is dependent upon something whichis happening elsewhere.* [footnote107.html#fn107]In the words of Stapp:…the conversion of potentialities into actualities cannot proceed on the basisof locally available information. If one accepts the usual ideas about howinformation propagates through space and time, then Bell’s theorem shows thatthe macroscopic responses cannot be independent of far-away causes. This problemis neither resolved nor alleviated by saying that the response is determined by“pure chance.” Bell’s theorem proves precisely that the determination of themacroscopic response must be “nonchance,” at least to the extent of allowingsome sort of dependence of this response upon the far-away cause.14Superluminal quantum connectedness seems to be, on the surface at least, apossible explanation for some types of psychic phenomena. Telepathy, forexample, often appears to happen instantaneously, if not faster. Psychicphenomena have been held in disdain by physicists since the days of Newton. Infact, most physicists do not even believe that they exist.*[footnote108.html#fn108]In this sense, Bell’s theorem could be the Trojan horse in the physicists’ camp;first, because it proves that quantum theory requires connections that appear toresemble telepathic communication, and second, because it provides themathematical framework through which serious physicists (all physicists areserious) could find themselves discussing types of phenomena which, ironically,they do not believe exist.The failure of the principle of local causes does not necessarily mean thatsuperluminal connections actually exist. There are other ways to explain thefailure of the principle of local causes. For example, the principle of localcauses—that what happens in one area does not depend upon variables subject tothe control of an experimenter in a distant space-like separated area—is basedupon two tacit assumptions which are so obvious that they are easy to overlook.First, the principle of local causes assumes that we have a choice about how weperform our experiments. Imagine that we are doing Clauser and Freedman’s photonexperiment. We have before us a switch which determines how the polarizers willbe positioned. If we throw the switch up, the polarizers are aligned with eachother. If we throw the switch down, the polarizers are oriented at right angleswith each other. Suppose that we decide to throw the switch up and align thepolarizers. Normally, we assume that we could have thrown the switch down andoriented the polarizers at right angles if we had wanted to. In other words, weassume that we are free to decide whether the switch before us will be up ordown when the experiment begins.The principle of local causes assumes (“…variables subject to the control of anexperimenter…”) that we possess and can exercise a free will in thedetermination of how to perform our experiment. Second, and this is even easierto overlook, the principle of local causes assumes that if we had performed ourexperiment in a different way than we actually did perform it, we would haveobtained some definite results. These two assumptions—that we can choose how toperform our experiment and that each of our choices, including those that we didnot select, produces or would have produced definite results—is what Stapp calls“contrafactual definiteness.”The fact, in this case, is that we decided to perform our experiment with theswitch in the “up” position. We assume that, contrary to this fact(contrafactually), we could have performed it with the switch in the “down”position. By performing the experiment with the switch in the “up” position, weobtained some definite results (a certain number of clicks in each area).Therefore, we assume that if we had chosen to perform the experiment with theswitch in the “down” position, we likewise would have obtained some definiteresults. (It is not necessary that we be able to calculate what these otherresults are.) Odd as it may seem, some physical theories, as we shall see, donot assume that “what would have happened if…” produces definite results.Since Bell’s theorem shows that, assuming the validity of quantum theory, theprinciple of local causes is incorrect, and, if we do not want to accept theexistence of superluminal connections (“the failure of locality”) as the reasonfor the failure of the principle of local causes, then we are forced to confrontthe possibility that our assumptions about contrafactual definiteness areincorrect (“contrafactual definiteness fails”). Since contrafactual definitenesshas two parts, there are two ways in which contrafactual definiteness couldfail.The first possibility is that free will is an illusion (“contrafactualnessfails”). Perhaps there is no such thing as “what would have happened if….”Perhaps there can be only what is. In this case, we are led to asuperdeterminism. This is a determinism far beyond ordinary determinism.Ordinary determinism states that once the initial situation of a system isestablished, the future of the system also is established since it must developaccording to inexplorable laws of cause and effect. This type of determinism wasthe basis of the Great Machine view of the universe. According to this view,however, if the initial situation of a system, like the universe, is changed,then the future of the system also is changed.According to superdeterminism, not even the initial situation of the universecould be changed. Not only is it impossible for things to be other than theyare, it is even impossible that the initial situation of the universe could havebeen other than what it was. No matter what we are doing at any given moment, itis the only thing that ever was possible for us to be doing at that moment.Contrafactual definiteness also fails if the “definiteness” assumption in itfails. In this case, we do have a choice in the way that we perform ourexperiments, but “what would have happened if…” does not produce any definiteresults. This alternative is just as strange as it sounds. It is also just whatcomes out of the Many Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics. According tothe Many Worlds theory, whenever a choice is made in the universe between onepossible event and another, the universe splits into different branches.In our hypothetical experiment we decided to throw the switch into the “up”position. When the experiment was performed with the switch in the “up”position, it gave us a definite result (a certain number of clicks in eacharea). However, according to the Many Worlds theory, at the moment that we threwthe switch up, the universe split into two branches. In one branch, theexperiment was performed with the switch in the “up” position. In the otherbranch, the experiment was performed with the switch in the “down” position.Who performed the experiment in the second branch? There is a different editionof us in each of the different branches of the universe! Each edition of us isconvinced that our branch of the universe is the entirety of reality.The experiment in the second branch, the experiment which was performed with theswitch in the “down” position, also produced a definite result (a certain numberof clicks in each area). However, that result is in another branch of theuniverse, not in ours. Therefore, as far as we in this branch of the universeare concerned, “what would have happened if…” actually did happen, and actuallydid produce definite results, but in a branch of the universe which is foreverbeyond our experiential reality.* [footnote109.html#fn109]On the next page is a diagram of the logical implications of Bell’s theorem. Itis drawn from informal discussions of the Fundamental Physics Group at theLawrence Berkeley Laboratory, under the direction and sponsorship of Dr.Elizabeth Rauscher. These discussions, in turn, were based primarily upon thework of Henry Stapp.image [Images/335.jpg]To summarize, Bell’s theorem showed, in 1964, that either the statisticalpredictions of quantum theory are false or the principle of local causes isfalse. In 1972, Clauser and Freedman performed an experiment at Berkeley whichvalidated the relevant statistical predictions of quantum theory. Therefore,according to Bell’s theorem, the principle of local causes must be false.The principle of local causes says that what happens in one area does not dependupon variables subject to the control of an experimenter in a distant space-likeseparated area. The simplest way to explain the failure of the principle oflocal causes is to conclude that what happens is one area does depend uponvariables subject to the control of an experimenter in a distant space-likeseparated area. If this explanation is correct, then we live in a nonlocaluniverse (“locality fails”) characterized by superluminal (faster than light)connections between apparently “separate parts.”However, there are other ways in which the principle of local causes can fail.The principle of local causes is based upon two tacit assumptions. The firsttacit assumption is that we have the ability to determine our own actions, i.e.,that we have a free will.* [footnote110.html#fn110] The second tacit assumptionis that when we choose to do one thing in place of another, “what would havehappened if…” would have produced definite results. These two assumptionstogether are what Stapp calls contrafactual definiteness.If the first assumption (contrafactualness) fails, then we are led to asuperdeterminism which precludes the idea of alternative possibilities.According to this type of determinism, it is not possible that the world evercould have been other than it is.If the second assumption (definiteness) fails, then we are led to the ManyWorlds theory in which the world continuously is splitting into separate andmutually inaccessible branches, each of which contains different editions of thesame actors performing different acts at the same time on different stages whichsomehow are located in the same place.There may be still ways to understand the failure of the principle of localcauses, but the very fact that it must fail means that the world is in some wayprofoundly different from our ordinary ideas about it. (Perhaps we really areliving in a dark cave.)The “no models” option on the diagram is, in effect, the CopenhagenInterpretation of Quantum Mechanics. In 1927, the most famous assemblage ofphysicists in history decided that it might not ever be possible to construct amodel of reality, i.e., to explain the way things “really are behind thescenes.” Despite the tidal wave of “knowledge” which has swept over us for fortyyears, the Fundamental Physics Group found it necessary, like the physicists atCopenhagen a half century before them, to acknowledge that it might not bepossible to construct a model of reality. This acknowledgment is more than arecognition of the limitations of this theory or that theory. It is arecognition emerging throughout the West that knowledge itself is limited. Saidanother way, it is a recognition of the difference between knowledge andwisdom.* [footnote111.html#fn111] Classical science starts with the assumption of separate parts which togetherconstitute physical reality. Since its inception, it has concerned itself withhow these separate parts are related.Newton’s great work showed that the earth, the moon, and the planets aregoverned by the same laws as falling apples. The French mathematician Descartesinvented a way of drawing pictures of relationships between differentmeasurements of time and distance. This process (analytic geometry) is awonderful tool for organizing a wealth of scattered data into one meaningfulpattern. Herein lies the strength of western science. It brings huge tracts ofapparently unrelated experience into a rational framework of simple conceptslike the laws of motion. The starting point of this process is a mental attitudewhich initially perceives the physical world as fragmented and differentexperiences as logically unrelated. Newtonian science is the effort to find therelationships between pre-existing “separate parts.”Quantum mechanics is based upon the opposite epistemological assumption. Thus,there are profound differences between Newtonian mechanics and quantum theory.The most fundamental difference between Newtonian physics and quantum mechanicsis the fact that quantum mechanics is based upon observations (“measurements”).Without a measurement of some kind, quantum mechanics is mute. Quantum mechanicssays nothing about what happens between measurements. In Heisenberg’s words:“The term ‘happens’ is restricted to the observation.”15 This is very important,for it constitutes a philosophy of science unlike any before it.We commonly say, for example, that we detect an electron at point A and then atpoint B, but strictly speaking, this is incorrect. According to quantummechanics, there was no electron which traveled from point A to point B. Thereare only the measurements that we made at point A and at point B.Quantum theory not only is closely bound to philosophy, but also—and this isbecoming increasingly apparent—to theories of perception. As early as 1932, vonNeumann explored this relation in his “Theory of Measurement.” (Exactly whendoes the wave function associated with a particle collapse? When the particlestrikes a photographic plate? When the photographic plate is developed? When thelight rays from the developed photographic plate strike our retina? When thenerve impulses from the retina reach our brain?).Bohr’s principle of complementarity also addresses the underlying relation ofphysics to consciousness. The experimenter’s choice of experiment determineswhich mutually exclusive aspect of the same phenomenon (wave or particle) willmanifest itself. Likewise, Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle demonstrates thatwe cannot observe a phenomenon without changing it. The physical propertieswhich we observe in the “eternal” world are enmeshed in our own perceptions notonly psychologically, but ontologically as well.The second most fundamental difference between Newtonian physics and quantumtheory is that Newtonian physics predicts events and quantum mechanics predictsthe probability of events. According to quantum mechanics, the only determinablerelation between events is statistical—that is, a matter of probability.David Bohm, Professor of Physics at Birkbeck College, University of London,proposes that quantum physics is, in fact, based upon a perception of a neworder. According to Bohm, “We must turn physics around. Instead of starting withparts and showing how they work together (the Cartesian order) we start with thewhole.”16Bohm’s theory is compatible with Bell’s theorem. Bell’s theorem implies that theapparently “separate parts” of the universe could be intimately connected at adeep and fundamental level. Bohm asserts that the most fundamental level is anunbroken wholeness which is, in his words, “that-which-is.” All things,including space, time, and matter, are forms of that-which-is. There is an orderwhich is enfolded into the very process of the universe, but that enfolded ordermay not be readily apparent.For example, imagine a large hollow cylinder into which is placed a smallercylinder. The space between the smaller cylinder and the larger cylinder isfilled with a clear viscous liquid like glycerine (such a device actuallyexists).Now suppose that we deposit a small droplet of ink on the surface of theglycerine. Because of the nature of the glycerine, the ink drop remains intact,a well-defined black spot floating on a clear liquid.image [Images/339.jpg]If we begin to rotate one of the cylinders, say in a clockwise direction, thedrop of ink spreads out in the opposite direction, making a line which growsthinner and thinner until it disappears altogether. The ink droplet now isenfolded completely into the glycerine, but it is still there. When we rotatethe cylinder in the opposite direction, the ink droplet reappears. A fine lineappears which grows thicker and thicker and then collects into a single point.If we continue the counterclockwise motion of the cylinder, the same thinghappens, but in reverse. We can repeat this process as often as we like. Eachtime the ink spot becomes a fine line and disappears into the glycerine only toreappear again when the motion of the glycerine is reversed.If it requires one complete revolution of the cylinder clockwise to make thedroplet disappear completely, one complete revolution of the cylindercounterclockwise will make it reappear in its original shape and location. Thenumber of revolutions required to make the droplet disappear or reappear is theenfolded order. Bohm calls this enfolded order the “implicate order,” whichmeans the same thing.Suppose that we deposit a drop of ink on the surface of the glycerine, revolvethe cylinder clockwise until the drop disappears (one revolution), add a seconddrop of ink to the glycerine, continue to revolve the cylinder in the samedirection until it disappears (one more revolution), and then add a third dropof ink to the glycerine and revolve the cylinder one more revolution until thethird drop also disappears. Now we have three ink drops enfolded into theglycerine. None of them are visible, but we know where each of them is in theimplicate order.When we revolve the cylinder in the opposite direction, one drop of ink (thethird) appears after one revolution, another drop of ink (the second) appearsafter the next revolution, and another drop of ink (the first) appears after thethird revolution. This is the unfolded, or “explicate,” order. The three inkdroplets appear to be unrelated in the explicate (unfolded) order, but we knowthat they are related in the implicate (enfolded) order.If we consider the condensation of ink droplets in this experiment as“particles,” we have Bohm’s hypothesis of apparently random subatomic phenomena.“Particles” may appear in different places yet be connected in the implicateorder. In Bohm’s words, “Particles may be discontiguous in space (the explicateorder) but contiguous in the implicate order.”17“Matter is a form of the implicate order as a vortex is a form of the water—itis not reducible to smaller particles.”18 Like “matter” and everything else,particles are forms of the implicate order. If this is difficult to grasp, it isbecause our minds demand to know, “What is the ‘implicate order’ the implicateorder of?”The “implicate order” is the implicate order of that-which-is. However,that-which-is is the implicate order. This world view is so different from theone that we are using that, as Bohm points out, “Description is totallyincompatible with what we want to say.”19 Description is incompatible with whatwe want to say because our thinking is based upon an ancient Greek mode ofthought. According to this mode of thought, only Being is. Therefore, Nonbeingis not. This way of thinking gives us a practical tool for dealing with theworld, but it doesn’t describe what happens. Actually, Nonbeing also is. BothBeing and Nonbeing are that-which-is. Everything, even “emptiness,” isthat-which-is. There is nothing which is not that-which-is.This way of looking at reality raises the question of the consciousness of theobserver. Our minds demand to know, “What is the ‘implicate order’ the implicateorder of?” because our culture has taught us to perceive only the explicateorder (the Cartesian view). “Things” to us are intrinsically separate.Bohm’s physics require, in his words, a new “instrument of thought.” A newinstrument of thought such as is needed to understand Bohm’s physics, however,would radically alter the consciousness of the observer, reorientating it towarda perception of the “unbroken wholeness” of which everything is a form.However, such a perception would not cause an inability to see the explicateorder. Bohm’s physics contains an element of relativity parallel to that ofEinstein’s theories. The implicate or explicate nature of order (or order ofnature) depends upon the perspective of the viewer. The problem is that ourpresent viewpoint is limited to the perspective of the explicate order. From theperspective of the implicate order the apparently “separate elements” of theexplicate order are intimately related. Even the phrases “elements” and“intimately related” imply a Cartesian separateness which does not exist. At thefundamental level of that-which-is, the “separate elements” which are“intimately related in the implicate order” are the implicate order.The requirement for a new instrument of thought upon which to base Bohm’sphysics may not be as much of an obstacle as it first appears. There alreadyexists an instrument of thought based upon an “unbroken wholeness.” Furthermore,there exist a number of sophisticated psychologies, distilled from two thousandyears of practice and introspection, whose sole purpose is to develop thisthought instrument.These psychologies are what we commonly call “Eastern religions.” “Easternreligions” differ considerably among themselves. It would be a mistake to equateHinduism, for example, with Buddhism, even though they are more like each otherthan either one of them is like a religion of the West. Nonetheless, all easternreligions (psychologies) are compatible in a very fundamental way with Bohm’sphysics and philosophy. All of them are based upon the experience of a pure,undifferentiated reality which is that-which-is.While it would be naive to overstate the similarities between Bohm’s physics andeastern philosophies, it would be foolish to ignore them. Consider, for example,the following sentences:The word “reality” is derived from the roots “thing” (res) and “think” (revi).“Reality” means “everything you can think about.” This is not “that-which-is.”No idea can capture “truth” in the sense of that-which-is.The ultimate perception does not originate in the brain or any materialstructure, although a material structure is necessary to manifest it. The subtlemechanism of knowing the truth does not originate in the brain.There is a similarity between thought and matter. All matter, includingourselves, is determined by “information.” “Information” is what determinesspace and time.Taken out of context, there is no absolute way of knowing whether thesestatements were made by Professor Bohm or a Tibetan Buddhist. In fact, thesesentences were excerpted from different parts of two physics lectures thatProfessor Bohm gave at Berkeley in April, 1977. The first lecture was given onthe campus to physics students. The second lecture was given in the LawrenceBerkeley Laboratory to a group of professional physicists. Two of these threestatements were taken from the second lecture, the one given to the advancedphysicists.It is ironic that while Bohm’s theories are received with some skepticism bymost professional physicists, they would find an immediately sympatheticreception among the thousands of people in our culture who have turned theirbacks on science in their own quest for the ultimate nature of reality.If Bohm’s physics, or one similar to it, should become the main thrust ofphysics in the future, the dances of East and West could blend in exquisiteharmony. Physics curricula of the twenty-first century could include classes inmeditation. The function of eastern religions (psychologies) is to allow the mind to escapethe confines of the symbolic. According to this view, everything is a symbol,not only words and concepts, but also people and things. Beyond the confines ofthe symbolic lies that which is, pure awareness, the experience of the“suchness” of reality.Nonetheless, every eastern religion resorts to the use of symbols to escape therealm of the symbolic. Some disciplines use symbols more than others, but all ofthem use symbols in one form or other. Therefore, the question arises, if pureawareness is considered distinct from the content of awareness, in what waysspecifically does the content of awareness affect the realization of pureawareness? What types of content prompt the mind to leap forward? What enablesit to activate the self-fulfilling capability to transcend itself?It is very difficult to answer this question. Any answer is only a point ofview. A point of view itself is limiting. To “understand” something is to giveup some other way of conceiving it. This is another way of saying that the minddeals in forms of limitation. Nonetheless, there is a relationship between thecontent of awareness and the ability of the mind to transcend itself.“Reality” is what we take to be true. What we take to be true is what webelieve. What we believe is based upon our perceptions. What we perceive dependsupon what we look for. What we look for depends upon what we think. What wethink depends upon what we perceive. What we perceive determines what webelieve. What we believe determines what we take to be true. What we take to betrue is our reality.The central focus of this process, initially at any rate, is “What we think.” Weat least can say that allegiance to a symbol of openness (Christ, Buddha,Krishna, “the infinite diversity of nature,” etc.) seems to open the mind andthat an open mind is often the first step in the process of enlightenment.The psychological gestalt of physics has shifted radically in the last centuryto one of extreme openness. In the middle 1800s, Newtonian mechanics was at itszenith. There seemed to be no phenomenon which could not be explained in termsof mechanical models. All mechanical models were subject to long-establishedprinciples. The chairman of the physics department at Harvard discouragedgraduate study because so few important matters remained unsolved.20In a speech to the Royal Institution in 1900, Lord Kelvin reflected that therewere only two “clouds” on the horizon of physics, the problem of black-bodyradiation and the Michelson-Morley experiment.21 There was no doubt, saidKelvin, that they soon would be gone. He was wrong. Kelvin’s two “clouds”signaled the end of the era that began with Galileo and Newton. The problem ofblack-body radiation led to Planck’s discovery of the quantum of action. Withinthirty years the entirety of Newtonian physics became a special limiting case ofthe newly developing quantum theory. The Michelson-Morley experimentforeshadowed Einstein’s famous theories of relativity. By 1927, the foundationsof the new physics, quantum mechanics and relativity, were in place.In contrast to Kelvin’s time, the allegiance of physicists today is to a symbolof extreme openness. Isidor Rabi, Nobel Prize winner and Chairman Emeritus ofthe Physics Department at Columbia University, wrote in 1975:I don’t think that physics will ever have an end. I think that the novelty ofnature is such that its variety will be infinite—not just in changing forms butin the profundity of insight and the newness of ideas…22Stapp wrote in 1971:…human inquiry can continue indefinitely to yield important new truths.23The “What we think” of physicists today is that the physics of nature, likehuman experience itself, is infinitely diverse.Eastern religions have nothing to say about physics, but they have a great dealto say about human experience. In Hindu mythology, Kali, the Divine Mother, isthe symbol for the infinite diversity of experience. Kali represents the entirephysical plane. She is the drama, tragedy, humor, and sorrow of life. She is thebrother, father, sister, mother, lover, and friend. She is the fiend, monster,beast, and brute. She is the sun and the ocean. She is the grass and the dew.She is our sense of accomplishment and our sense of doing worthwhile. Our thrillof discovery is a pendant on her bracelet. Our gratification is a spot of coloron her cheek. Our sense of importance is the bell on her toe.This full and seductive, terrible and wonderful earth mother always hassomething to offer. Hindus know the impossibility of seducing her or conqueringher and the futility of loving her or hating her; so they do the only thing thatthey can do. They simply honor her.In a particular story, Kali, the Divine Mother, is Sita, the wife of God. Ram isGod. Ram, Sita, and Laksaman, who is Ram’s brother, are walking along a jungletrail. The path is so narrow that most of the time Laksaman can see only Sita,who walks between him and Ram. Every so often, however, the path turns in such away that Laksaman can see his brother, God.These powerful metaphors have application to the developing drama of physics.Although most physicists have little patience (professionally) with metaphors,physics itself has become a powerful metaphor. Twentieth-century physics is thestory of a journey from intellectual entrenchment to intellectual openness,despite the conservative prove-it-to-me nature of individual physicists. Therealization that the discoveries of physics never will end has broughtphysicists, as well as those who have followed the story of physics, to anextremely fertile plateau. This realization invites the intellect to leapforward, although at great risk to its present hegemony.The Wu Li Masters know that physicists are doing more than “discovering theendless diversity of nature.” They are dancing with Kali, the Divine Mother ofHindu mythology. Buddhism is both a philosophy and a practice. Buddhist philosophy is rich andprofound. Buddhist practice is called Tantra. Tantra is the Sanskrit wordmeaning “to weave.” There is little that can be said about Tantra. It must bedone.Buddhist philosophy reached its ultimate development in the second century A.D.No one has been able to improve much on it since then. The distinction betweenBuddhist philosophy and Tantra is well defined. Buddhist philosophy can beintellectualized. Tantra cannot. Buddhist philosophy is a function of therational mind. Tantra transcends rationality. The most profound thinkers of theIndian civilization discovered that words and concepts could take them only sofar. Beyond that point came the actual doing of a practice, the experience ofwhich was ineffable. This did not prevent them from progressively refining thepractice into an extremely effective and sophisticated set of techniques, but itdid prevent them from being able to describe the experiences which thesetechniques produce.The practice of Tantra does not mean the end of rational thought. It means theintegration of thought based on symbols into larger spectrums of awareness.(Enlightened people still remember their zip codes.)The development of Buddhism in India shows that a profound and penetratingintellectual quest into the ultimate nature of reality can culminate in, or atleast set the stage for, a quantum leap beyond rationality. In fact, on anindividual level, this is one of the roads to enlightenment. Tibetan Buddhismcalls it the Path without Form, or the Practice of Mind. The Path without Formis prescribed for people of intellectual temperament. The science of physics isfollowing a similar path.The development of physics in the twentieth century already has transformed theconsciousness of those involved with it. The study of complementarity, theuncertainty principle, quantum field theory, and the Copenhagen Interpretationof Quantum Mechanics produces insights into the nature of reality very similarto those produced by the study of eastern philosophy. The profound physicists ofthis century increasingly have become aware that they are confronting theineffable.Max Planck, the father of quantum mechanics, wrote:Science…means unresting endeavor and continually progressing development towardan aim which the poetic intuition may apprehend, but which the intellect cannever fully grasp.24We are approaching the end of science. “The end of science” does not mean theend of the “unresting endeavor and continually progressing development” of moreand more comprehensive and useful physical theories. (Enlightened physicistsremember their zip codes, too.) The “end of science” means the coming of westerncivilization, in its own time and in its own way, into the higher dimensions ofhuman experience.Professor G. F. Chew, Chairman of the Physics Department at Berkeley, remarked,in reference to a theory of particle physics:Our current struggle [with certain aspects of advanced physics] may thus be onlya foretaste of a completely new form of human intellectual endeavor, one thatwill not only lie outside physics but will not even be describable as“scientific.”25We need not make a pilgrimage to India or Tibet. There is much to learn there,but here at home, in the most inconceivable of places, amidst the particleaccelerators and computers, our own Path without Form is emerging. Al Huang, the Tai Chi Master who created the metaphor of Wu Li, once wrote“…sooner or later we reach a dead end when we talk.”26 He could as well havesaid that sooner or later we go round in circles when we talk since going roundin a circle is one kind of dead end.As we sat in a cabin at Esalen and talked late into the night, my new friend,David Finkelstein, spoke to us softly.I think it would be misleading to call particles the entities involved in themost primitive events of the theory [quantum topology] because they don’t movein space and time, they don’t carry mass, they don’t have charge, they don’thave energy in the usual sense of the word.QUESTION: So what is it that makes events at that level? ANSWER: Who are the dancers and who the dance? They have no attributes otherthan the dance. QUESTION: What is “they”? ANSWER: The things that dance, the dancers. My God! We’re back to the title ofthe book.27"},{"pageContent":"NOTES [dancingwulimastersthe_con01.html#bm_01]Epigraphs 1.

This table was complied with the assistance of the Particle Data Group,Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, Berkeley, California. According to theirconvention, stable particles are particles that do not decay by stronginteraction; but they do decay by electromagnetic and weak interactions. Infact, (as the table shows), the majority of stable particles are not ‘stable’ inthe usual sense. 2. Incredible as it may seem, physicists measure particle lifetimes (and masses)to far greater degrees of accuracy than indicated here. (“Review of ParticleProperties,” Physics Letter, 75B, 1, 1978.) (updated bi-annually). 3. Particles with this footnote are speculative to one degree or another. Thegraviton has been predicted solely on a theoretical basis while the tauneutrino, the F particle, and the charmed lambda have some experimental evidenceto support their existence. However, none of them have been accepted, at thisdate, as confirmed particles by the Particle Data Group, Lawrence BerkeleyLaboratory, the internationally accepted compiler of particle data. (Theparameters shown for these particles have not been measured, but they generallyare assumed to have the values shown). The blank spaces in the table represent alack of data. [Information on the Tau and D particles, the newest particles asthis table goes to print (1978), is still incomplete.] 4. The neutral kaon has two average lifetimes. If it decays in the shorter timeit is called as a Kimage [Images/377a.jpg] (“K zero short”). If it decays in thelonger time it is called a Kimage [Images/377b.jpg] (“K zero long”). All theother particles have only one average lifetime."},{"pageContent":"STABLE PARTICLE TABLE [dancingwulimastersthe_con01.html#bm_03]1image [Images/378.jpg]image [Images/379.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"AN INVITATIONAt the heart of The Dancing Wu Li Masters (and every inquiry into quantumphysics), in my opinion, is the inviting possibility of a relationship betweenconsciousness and physical reality.

I believe that this relationship isalso becoming evident for millions of other individuals.In 1989 I wrote The Seat of the Soul, about evolution, the soul, and authenticpower—the alignment of the personality with the soul.

Idiscovered, in the course of writing this book, that physicists, from graduatestudents to Nobel Laureates, are a gracious group of people; accessible,helpful, and engaging. This discovery shattered my long-held stereotype of thecold, “objective” scientific personality. For this, above all, I am grateful tothe people listed here.Jack Sarfatti, Ph.D., brought me together with many physicists. Al Chung-liangHuang, The T’ai Chi Master, provided the perfect metaphor of Wu Li, inspiration,and the beautiful calligraphy. David Finkelstein, Ph.D., Director of the Schoolof Physics, Georgia Institute of Technology, was my first tutor.In addition to Finkelstein and Sarfatti, Brian Josephson, Professor of Physics,Cambridge University, and Max Jammer, Professor of Physics, Bar-Ilan University,Ramat-Gan, Israel, read and commented upon the entire manuscript. I amespecially indebted to these men (but I do not wish to imply that any one ofthem, or any other of the individualistic and creative thinkers who helped mewith this book, would approve of it, page for page, as it is written, nor thatthe responsibility for any errors or misinterpretations belongs to anyone butme).I am also indebted to Henry Stapp, Ph.D., Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, forreading and commenting upon portions of the manuscript, and to ElizabethRauscher, Ph.D., founder and sponsor of the Fundamental Physics Group, LawrenceBerkeley Laboratory, for encouraging non-physicists to partake of weeklyconferences which normally would attract only physicists. In addition to Stappand Sarfatti, this group included John Clauser, Ph.D.; Philippe Eberhard, Ph.D.;George Weissman, Ph.D.; Fred Wolf, Ph.D.; and Fritjof Capra, Ph.D.; amongothers.I am grateful to Carson Jefferies, Professor of Physics, University ofCalifornia at Berkeley, for his support and for commenting upon portions of themanuscript; to David Bohm, Professor of Physics, Birkbeck College, University ofLondon, for reading portions of the manuscript; to Saul-Paul Sirag for hisfrequent assistance; to the physicists of the Particle Data Group, LawrenceBerkeley Laboratory, for their assistance in compiling the particle table at theback of the book; to Eleanor Criswell, Professor of Psychology, Sonoma StateUniversity (California), for her valuable support; to Gin McCollum, Professor ofMathematics, Kansas State University, for her assistance and for her patienttutelage; and to Nick Herbert, Ph.D., Director of the C-Life Institute, forproviding me with his excellent papers on Bell’s theorem and for permission touse his paper title, “More Than Both,” as a chapter title.All of the illustrations in this book were done by Thomas Linden Robinson.Harvey White, Professor Emeritus, Department of Physics, University ofCalifornia at Berkeley, and former Director, Lawrence Hall of Science,personally provided photographs of his famous simulations of probabilitydistribution patterns. The electron diffraction photograph was provided byRonald Gronsky, Ph.D., Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. I learned much aboutspectroscopy from Sumner Davis, Professor of Physics, University of Californiaat Berkeley. I am deeply grateful to these men who, like all of the physiciststhat I encountered in writing this book, gave graciously of their time andknowledge to a stranger who needed help.I also am indebted to Maria Guarnaschelli, my editor, for her sensitivity anderudition.Without the generosity of Michael Murphy and the Board of Directors of theEsalen Institute, which sponsored the 1976 conference on physics andconsciousness, none of this probably would have happened."},{"pageContent":"ABOUT THE AUTHOR [dancingwulimastersthe_con01.html#ata_01]GARY ZUKAV is the author of the New York Times bestseller Soul Stories and TheSeat of the Soul, a number one bestseller for the New York Times, Los AngelesTimes, and USA Today, among others.

Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen point out that we could have chosen to placethe axis of the magnet in area A either in the vertical position or in thehorizontal position, and that in each case we would have observed a definiteresult—either up or down in the vertical case, or right or left in thehorizontal case. They also assert that what we do (choose to measure or observe)in area A cannot affect the real factual situation in area B. Thus they concludethere must exist simultaneously in area B a definite spin, up or down, and alsoa definite spin, right or left, to account for all the possible results that wecan get by orienting the magnet in area A one way or the other. Quantum theory is not able to describe such a state and hence Einstein,Podolsky, and Rosen concluded that the description which quantum theory providesis not complete; the quantum description cannot represent certain informationabout the system in area B (the simultaneous existence of different spin states)that is needed to completely describe the situation there."},{"pageContent":"* [dancingwulimastersthe_ch12.html#fn_101]The original version of Bell’s theoreminvolves spin ½ particles.

This assumption seemed plausible to most physicists because mostphysicists doubted that the real factual situation in one area of the EPRexperiment actually was being influenced by the actions of a faraway observer.Their doubts arose from the fact that the quantum state composed of equal partsup and down is exactly equivalent to the quantum state composed of equal partsright and left. These two combinations are experimentally indistinguishable.Thus the actions of the far-away observer, by themselves, can have no observableeffects here. Hence it is not clear that the real factual situation here isbeing changed. The Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen argument (and the principle of local causes)was demolished by Bell in 1964. Bell showed that several assumptions that areimplicit in the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen argument imply that what happensexperimentally in area B must depend on what the experimenter does in area A, orvice versa. The sufficient assumptions are: (1) that the observer in each areacan orient the magnetic field in his area in either of the two alternativedirections; (2) that some particular (although generally unknown) experimentalresult can be assumed to occur in each of the four alternative experimentalsituations; and (3) that the statistical predictions of quantum theory are valid(say to within 3%) in each of the four alternative cases. Bell’s argumentdemonstrates by simple arithmetic that these three assumptions imply that theexperimental results in one of the two areas must depend on what the observer inthe other area chooses to observe (i.e., on how he orients the magnetic field ofhis Stern-Gerlach device).

This collapse of the wave function is a suddenglobal change of the wave function of a system. It takes place when any part ofthe system is observed. That is, when an observation on the system is made inone region the wave function changes instantly, not only in that region, butalso in far-away regions. This behavior is completely natural for a functionthat describes probabilities for probabilities depend on what is known about thesystem, and if knowledge changes as a result of an observation, then theprobability function (the amplitude of the wave function squared) should change.Thus a change in the probability function in a distant region is normal even inclassical physics. It reflects the fact that the parts of the system arecorrelated with each other, and hence, that an increase of information here isaccompanied by an increase of information about the system elsewhere. However,in quantum theory this collapse of the wave function is such that what happensin a far-away place must, in some cases, depend on what an observer here choosesto observe, what you see there depends on what I do here.

Similarly, on the second branch, where the axis of the magnetic field ishorizontal, there is also a branching into two twigs. On the first of thesetwigs the result is spin right, and on the second of these twigs, the result isspin left. Thus, on any given twig of any branch there is a definite result(spin up, down, right, or left), but the idea of “what would have happened ifone had chosen the ‘other branch’ ” makes no sense, for both results (up ordown, or right or left) occur on different branches.

The main thrust ofthe Copenhagen Interpretation, which is the interpretation of quantum theoryaccepted by the bulk of the scientific community, is that the proper goal ofscience is to provide a mathematical framework for organizing and expanding ourexperiences, rather than providing a picture of some reality that could liebehind these experiences. That is, most physicists today side with Bohr, ratherthan with Einstein, on the question of the utility of seeking a model of areality that can be conceived of independently of our experience of it. From theCopenhagen point of view, quantum theory is satisfactory as it is, and theeffort to “understand” it more deeply is not productive for science. Suchefforts lead to perplexities of just the sort that we have been discussing.These perplexities seem to most physicists to be more philosophical thanphysical. Thus most physicists choose the “no model” option shown in the diagramon page 335."}]
